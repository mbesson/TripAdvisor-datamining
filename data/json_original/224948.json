It is incredible, and never disappoints. The rooms are beautifully furnished and decorated, and have just been completely redone. But the staff,and the services they provide, are what makes a stay at the Omni truly incredible. Whether it is the manager, the desk clerk, the bellman, the maid, the room service waiter, or the concierge -- all of them are wonderfully friendly and helpful. They remember and recognize you, typically greet you by (last) name, and offer to assist. And they are incredibly informative as well. For example, during our most recent trip we consulted the concierge about new nearby restaurants (we are quite familiar with the older ones), and he not only displayed incredibly detailed knowledge of the nearby culinary delights but, since I was in no hurry and was interested, also gave me some wonderful background information about each establishment he mentioned, its owner, and its principal chef. My parting thought was simple: \"Wow, this guy really knows his stuff!\" Finally, I should mention that the Omni's location, at California and Montgomery Streets, is close to financial firms (on Montgomery), not far from Union Square (for shopping), just a block from a cluster of outdoor restaurants at Belden Place, about thirty feet from one of the main streetcar stops, and just a brief taxi ride from literally hundreds of wonderful restaurants (in addition to having one on its premises).

Very Highly Recommended.\u201d", "Author": "ST1951", "ReviewID": "UR127190597", "Content": "I stayed at the San Francisco Omni from 17th to 24th March. This was my second stay at the hotel and I am pleased to say that I found it as excellent as my first visit. Firstly, I have to thank Sarah Crown for her assistance in dealing with my room request prior to my stay. She gave first class customer service and it was an absolute pleasure to deal with her. Secondly I would like to comment on a couple of reviews below which I believe are unfair to the housekeeping staff. My experience at the Omni is that the same high standard of cleaning is carried out irrespective of whether a tip is left or not and housekeepers are certainly not noisy. I stayed for five nights on my first visit and seven nights this time. On each occasion I cannot fault anything about the way in which my room was maintained. As far as I am concerned the housekeepers are friendly, hard working and meticulous. I certainly did not hear any door slamming by them and I was in and out of my room at various times during the day. The only door slamming I heard was in the early hours of the morning by guests returning to their rooms. I very much doubt that the housekeepers are cleaning rooms at 02.47! As an aside, I fail to understand why some guests have no consideration for other people and seem incapable of shutting a door quietly rather than attempting to remove it from it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hinges. Perhaps they live in door less houses and have not fully grasped the concept of how a door should be closed! OK, having gotten that off my chest, I will get to the review. Although I have previously reviewed this hotel it is a real pleasure to spend time preparing another review as the standard of the hotel warrants it. The location is great. An easy transfer from SFO by BART and short (flat) walk up Montgomery. It is only a short distance to Union Sq and an equally short distance to North Beach and my favourite bars! An excellent welcome and speedy check in from staff who really seem to want to go that extra mile to be helpful. All the staff I encountered were, in fact, first class in all respects. Rooms are a good size and, as aforementioned, well maintained. Beds are comfortable and there is a good selection of pillows. The Wi Fi signal is strong and I suggest joining the (free) Select Guest programme to avoid a $9.95 daily charge. Other benefits of the programme include complimentary water, beverages and turn down service. It is well worth spending the short time it takes to join. There are tea and coffee making facilities in the room and also a mini bar. The large comfortable chair and footrest were particularly beneficial after a day negotiating the hills of San Francisco. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the bar or Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Steak and Chop House as I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t used either. To be quite honest there are so many great places to eat and drink in this wonderful city it seems a shame not to get out and enjoy them. I have seriously lost count of the number of hotels I have stayed in over the years both for business and leisure. I have a lot of experience of the good and the bad and, take it from me, I am not easily pleased especially as regards noise and cleanliness. The San Francisco Omni is, without any shadow of doubt, one of the best hotels I have stayed in and ticks all the boxes. My next stay is already booked for September and I fully intend to return in 2013. My advice is to give it a try.

A few moments later, our bellman welcomed us to our room where there were cold milks and cookies already waiting for our kids (that was SUPER impressive given we were not in the check-in area very long and gave no warning of arrival prior to walking in the door). Our room was clean and the furniture and carpeting was in great shape.

When we returned around dinner time, our room hadn't been cleaned, but we had a message from housekeeping explaining why.

We anticipated not being able to check in because it was around noon, and leaving our luggage for a few hours. However, Laura explained to us that by joining the loyalty program we were awarded with early check-in, free in-room wi-fi, complementary pressing and shoe shine, and breakfast beverage service for each of us every morning of our stay. She tipped us off that if we order one coffee, there was enough in the pot for three cups, so it would be wise to order one coffee, and one juice to share. Made perfect sense to me and was probably not something I would think of myself, so that was nice of her (its the little things like that, that make me happy). We were given room #1108, which is a standard King. The hotel is in the financial district, so our room looked out immediately to other office buildings. Good location if you want a better chance of less night life street noise. I was a bit disappointed that the windows were not well sound-proofed, and what little street noise there was, we heard clearly. Unfortunately, the same could be said of the walls. For both nights of our stay we were sandwiched between guests with small children. We could tell exactly when the guests were in their rooms with the children playing, crying, whining, and the age-old argument between a wife complaining to her husband about not being able to shower because she had to watch the kids. The bed was very comfortable, even when we were shaken awake by the small earthquake that Monday morning :) The wi-fi was actually decent!!! Both my husband and I were able to go wi-fi only at the same time, a rarity it seems at hotels. Although I don't use it, I liked that the hotel provided spray starch for ironing. Good business hotel touch. The bathroom was spacious for a standard size room, the products were customized via Sysco but still nice, the shower pressure good, and well lit. I always appreciate it when hotels provide robes. The cons: Few. Aside from the \"thin\" walls and windows, if you stay on the weekend, all the really close-by breakfast food places are closed. I'm not a big breakfast eater, but I do like to be able to quickly run out, grab a pastry, and then come back to the hotel to get ready for the day. On weekdays this isn't a problem because there are many cafes that cater to the business crowd. La Boulange is right across the street and is probably the best option.

When we asked him for restaurant recommendations for lunch (we had just flown in and were tired) he just vaguely waved his arms and said \"there are hundreds around here, take your pick\". Unhelpful. However, subsequent front desk staff were lovely. Low battery in our in-room safe. Lodgenet was terrible quality. I don't like paying for Wi-Fi. I find it cheap on the hotel's part.

The Christmas tree and decorations and Christmas music in the lobby were welcoming and cosy. Frequent warm apple cider, apples and ginger cookies were a welcome treat each evening. We were made welcome and felt part of the family during our stay away from home over Christmas. I stay in many hotels in the UK as part of my work and I can honestly say that the Omni has been the most pleasurable hotel stay I have ever experienced. This may sound over the top but it's true.

We had a very nice room on the 16th floor with one of the most comfortable hotel beds we'd ever had the pleasure of sleeping in. Prior to making our reservation, we joined their Select Guest program. What a great thing to do! Because we were members (membership is free) we were given a beverage of our choice (coffee, tea, juice or milk) delivered to our room at our preferred time in the morning along with two newspapers--all complimentary! We had breakfast at the hotel's on-site restaurant and were pleased with our breakfast. We also had an appetizer and drinks in the hotel's bar. Internet access is also complimentary. The only negative is that the valet parking rate is steep--$55! We walked a half block to a local garage and paid $39 for the night. Next time we'll take BART into the city. Great hotel! Great staff!

That prompted me to book a night there for a quick trip my wife and I had planned. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by every single hotel staff person we encountered, with offers of help and welcome. This was not done in any overbearing way and felt quite genuine. Our room was on the 14th floor. The room was very nice, clean, and very quiet. We hadn't opted for a view and indeed were given the opportunity to look into office windows of the three buildings surrounding the alley courtyard behind our side of the hotel. The TransAmerica Building could be seen soaring high above one of them. It was sunny and well-lit, so we weren't disappointed by that. A little background: Our last hotel, two weeks earlier, had been in Beijing, China. The contrast couldn't have been greater. A 4-star hotel, it looked very fancy at first glance (and from 20 feet away). A closer inspection was almost horrifying. The place was absolutely filthy. In the 8 days we stayed there, our sheets were never changed, the bathroom always smelled like a sewer, and our clean fingernails at night were dirty upon getting up in the morning. The bed must have been made of concrete, and the lock on the entry door didn't work. So by contrast, the Omni was absolutely a wonderful place. Mind you, this comparison is quite unfair, in that the Omni should not be described with any association with the other hotel. The Omni stands in its own right as a fine hotel, a world-class hotel, with a staff that went out of its way at every opportunity to serve us with a smile and no hesitation. Location-wise, it is terrific. Sited at the intersection of Montgomery and California, it is about 6-blocks from the Ferry Building, next door to China Town, the California Cable Car runs by the front door, and Nob Hill is just to the west, up the street. All the major cultural and performance centers are within easy walking access and restaurants are all over the place. We slept soundly, enjoyed the lovely clean, nicely scented bathroom, and comfortable clean (did I say clean?) bed. There was a large safe in the closet and a locking refrigerator where we kept snacks bought at a nearby deli.

I am comparing to top hotels such as the Four Seasons Beverly Hills, the Fairmont Plaza NY - customer service at the Omni was superior to hotels in the highest class. The Cable Cars stop just out front, making the location ideal. Restaurants and chinatown within a very easy walk from this hotel. My only complaints are very minor ones, and just an FYI for other guests. They will not stop me from booking a room at the Omni every time we travel to San Francisco. I wouldn't even look elsewhere- they were that great! The small downsides: The heat/air conditioning was outdated (I think) and loud in it's on and off cycle. Not smooth at all. The first morning at 8am we could hear the housekeeping knocking on the door next to ours. Over and over. There is little to no soundproofing from the door to the room and this woke us all up unnecessarily. The parking costs are ridiculously high.

And now this is where I'll be staying when I come in the future. As other reviewers mention, the staff is not just friendly and helpful but competent. When checking in, I asked about where the local markets were. The front desk person proceeded to show me in great detail on the map exactly where each of them were - Safeway, Trader Joes, Whole foods. Wow! When I needed to mail something out after checking out, the front desk person got me the forms and hunted around for a suitable sized box that I could use. There was no subtle sense that I was \"imposing\" on them which I have experienced at other hotels. On to the rooms: they were super clean and shiny and the lighting was really nice. Nothing in the room seemed worn out or run down. The bathroom amenities were products that I would actually use outside of the hotel. They have turndown service with great chocolates. I was able to use the refrigerator to store some leftovers and food items without any hassle (there's no sensor-type system which automatically charges you) so I didn't have to order a refrigerator. When I needed a cab, the door man efficiently called one right away. All these small details really add up to a pleasant stay. The staff is attentive and the accomodations are elegant, but there's never a sense of it being over-the-top or ostentatious. The place has just the right combination of refinement and humility. The one thing that wasn't quite up to the high standard was the fitness center. The cardio machines were good and the room had windows, so that's a plus.

It is a gorgeous King suite attached to a fun room with bunkbeds, bean bag chairs, toys and books. I need to start by saying that we really enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again. However there is a little room for improvement. When we made the reservation we asked if we could get an early check-in at noon. The reservations assistant said they would put in the request. We got there later than expected at 2pm, and the room wasn't ready and that was kind of a bummer. They said they would put a rush on it, but I wish they had done this earlier. When we got into the rooms we were very impressed. My kids loved that the room was catered to them. Now here come my small complaints. The movies were like $11 to rent, the video games were $6.95/hour, and they had a little fridge and basket in the room with outrageously priced snacks. Snacks that were VERY tempting to my kids. Bags of skittles, cookies, M&M's, etc. In the fridge they had yogurts, drinks, etc. Actually, some of the snacks weren't exorbitant, but I still didn't want my kids drooling over them. The snacks in our room (the King bed side) had insane prices. A candy bar was $5. A large bottle of water was $7. Needless to say we didn't partake in any of these foods. More than the foods though, the kids were really bummed they couldn't play the video games. It seemed like such a tease to have a game controller there that they had to pay to play. So my biggest suggestion would be to include the use of the video games (and if possible some kid movies too) in the cost of the $350/night room. Also, maybe bring the prices down a bit on the snacks. I thought we were going to receive a newspaper and juice/coffee in the morning as being Select Members, but they did not come. Maybe we were supposed to request them? Now back to the good. The rooms were really quiet, clean, tastefully decorated, and spacious. The bed was soooo comfortable. All the staff was exceptionally nice and attentive. They did give the kids little backpacks upon arrival with a few coloring items and small toys. They did also bring them cookies and milk in the evening which was really sweet. Overall I thought this was a quality hotel in a great location.

The first was a business trip that was picked up through our company. I was placed at the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental a few blocks up California street from the Omni. What a boring hotel. Seemed everyone there was very snobby and that if you didn't conform to a certain dress code you were frowned upon. So, imagine my surprise when I came back to San Francisco on a pleasure trip and stayed at the Omni. What a totally different animal this place is compared to the \"stiffs\" at Mark Hopkins. I have always loved the Omni brand. I stay at their hotels across the country often during business conventions. Every single Omni hotel I have stayed at has been a class-act from the staff, to the rooms and the food. Coming to San Francisco was reward travel for being a member of their loyalty program. When I built up enough credits for 2 free nights, I decided to come out to my favorite city in the United States. From the moment I arrived, I felt like family. The rental company upgraded me to a huge Lincoln Town Car. So, when I arrive in front of the hotel, the valet ignored me thinking I was car service dropping off passengers. It took a while, but the doorman recognized that I was just sitting there waiting and he came over and made certain I was taken care of. I don't know who the portly doorman was, but he as incredibly charming and funny. You could not have been wanted to be met by anyone more personable than this guy and I wish I had the opportunity to have talked to him more. He was gone by the end of Friday afternoon,and I am guessing off for the weekend I was there. When I got inside I was also greeted very warmly by the gentleman at the front desk who asked me where I was from. When I told him I was from New Jersey, he told me a story of a sub shop he remembers from Princeton, a town not too far from where I lived. Just one of those really nice exchanges that makes you feel welcomed. And, even though the hotel was sold out the day before and rooms were scarce at the point of my early check-in, the clerk went out of his way to get me into a room. I had a room on the 8th floor, facing the middle of the hotel center. This means it didn't have a view of the street. That was fine. The room was actually very quiet. That evening, I got a knock on the door from room service and was handed a bottle of water and a bag of vegetarian granola (which was really good), as a loyalty program \"welcome back\" gift. In addition, as a loyalty member, I get free WiFi and my choice of free beverage delivered to my door every morning. And you know what? All it takes to become a loyalty member is to sign up on the Omni website prior to your stay. I think Omni has the best loyalty benefits of any hotel I have stayed with. Free Internet and beverages? How can you not be happy staying at the Omni. And, for the two days I spent at the hotel, you couldn't walk inside without a staff member smiling at you with a \"hello\" or \"welcome back.\" Step in the lobby and there is this faint perfume smell that really warmes the senses. ....and, while valet parking is about expensive as any other hotel in the city (at least $50 per night), there is a substantial discount on Friday and Saturday nights. Valet Parking only cost me $30 each night which I thought was great. By the way, the valets did a superb job in getting me my vehicle in a short timeframe. I don't think I have anything negative to say about this hotel. I don't think I'll ever stay at another hotel when travling to San Francisco. The people here seem much happier than they do at the Mark Hopkins. Much more smiling and the sounds of \"hello\" in the elevator. Clean, comfortable, inviting.

We generally come to SF every year around the same time on account of a cycling event in Santa Rosa. This year, the hotel prices were exceptionally high due to a few events that coincided (a big Oracle convention along with Fleet Week), so we waited to book. The Omni ended up having a reasonable rate, and given the high Trip Advisor ranking, it seemed like a sure bet. We were not disappointed! The location of the Omni is perfect - a stone's throw from the Ferry Building and Chinatown, and a short walk to Union Square. It is a very safe area, not nearly as hectic as Union Square, which is sometimes a good thing! The bellman Adam was very helpful upon arrival and offered immediately to store the bike box and car seat for us. The room was on the smaller side, but very well appointed and clean. The linens were of high quality and the bed really comfortable. They provided our four year old with a back pack of activities, and also sent up milk and cookies each night, which was a really nice touch. The Nespresso machine was fabulous. As others have indicated, sign up for the loyalty program for free wi-fi and a complimentary beverage service in the morning. The fitness centre is clean and spacious. We didn't eat at the restaurant, but the hotel's concierge, John, was very helpful in making lots of suggestions, based on our wishes. Top notch service!

Yes, this is more of a business hotel because of the location, but honestly, staying down by the piers would just be too touristy for us. The hotel has a very helpful and knowledgeable concierge, but honestly, every staff member knows their \"stuff\" and is more than willing to spend time informing you.

Focused on providing responsive customer service, the Omni staff is friendly and pro-active in addressing the needs of guests. You will find the rooms are sufficiently large and the beds are of high quality - with thick, soft comforters. The bathrooms are more than adequate in size and quality. From a location perspective, the Omni is well situated in the heart of downtown and within easy walking distance to Chinatown, the Bay, and Pac Bell Park (the San Francisco Giants stadium). One recommendation for those wanting to save a few $. The subway (BART) runs from the airport to Montgomery station for $8, which is only about 5 blocks from the hotel (a comfortable walk). This is much cheaper than the $40 you will pay for a cab, for those who cannot expense their travel. While I can offer no drawbacks to the rooms or staff, there is some street noise that filters into the rooms, esp when sirens go off or horns are used. This is not unique to the Omni, but since it is situated on a busy corner of downtown, you get a lot of traffic - even in the evening. I will also point out that the rooms do not have particularly nice views. You can see other tall buildings and the streets of the city, but not the Bay nor the broader skyline. Not a big deal, but definitely not a romantic setting. Speaking of romance, this is not the hotel to bring your spouse for that special occassion. While a perfect stay, in many ways, for the business traveler, there is nothing about this hotel that lends itself to romance or having a memorable experience with your true-love.

The Omni was easily the favorite of our five hotel, 12 night trip. The customer service at The Omni was unparalleled and sets it apart from other hotels, both on this trip and in my overall travel. It was nice to show my son what world class hotel service looks like. Reservations staff, front desk personnel, the bell staff and most prominently the concierges were all great to work with. The excellent customer service started even before we checked in. I had been checking various websites for several months before we left on our trip, looking for bargains and good deals. When I saw a reference to a $199 per night rate for The Omni, with full cancellation rights up until the day before check-in, I immediately made the reservation, recognizing this was a great price for a highly rated hotel in San Francisco. I was quite surprised when my credit card bill arrived about 7 weeks later with a charge for the full four night cost of my reservation. I made a call to the hotel and left a message with the reservations staff. Within an hour they had called back to tell me that the rate I had booked was a full prepayment rate with no cancellation rights. They immediately told me that I had apparently booked the first day the rate was on the website and that it originally had been erroneously set up without prepayment requirements. The offer was corrected the day after I made my reservation and an automated billing program searching for the package I bought without a charge, billed me for it. I was told that a full credit had already been issued to my account and the package name was changed to keep me from being charged again, but the price and all other components of my package would be honored. I had expected a fight, but The Omni clearly recognized my reservation did not state prepayment and they immediately admitted it. It was nice to not only receive information that my credit was issued, but to also be told how it happened and what was done to make sure it did not happen again - for me that is very important and is a sign of good policies. We flew in to SFO around Noon on a Saturday. We foolishly took BART from the airport in to The City. I say foolishly simply because we spent too much time getting to the BART station and then waiting for the train. We should have taken a cab. We lost an hour of sight-seeing opportunities. Having said that, the walk from the Montgomery Street BART/Muni station was easy, even with our 12 days of luggage. The walk was generally flat. The Omni sits at the base of the climb up California Street that eventually reaches Nob Hill. Our request was for a room on a high floor away from the elevator. Because we arrived prior to check-in time, not all rooms had been cleaned. We were offerered and took a room on the 9th floor, near the elevator. Our concerns about noise near the elevator were unfounded. The room was very quiet and we enjoyed the convenience of being close to the elevators. We joined the Select Guest program when I made the reservation. Members receive free wireless internet in the room as well as free morning beverages. We had orange juice delivered each morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very nice to have. Cookies and milk were brought each evening \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice touch although we were rarely in the room when they were delivered. Maintaining a comfortable temperature in the room was easy, the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was appropriately sized, towels were plush, toiletries were very nice. The in room safe was large enough for my netbook and my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mac. As I noted above the concierges were incredible to work with. All of the concierges were very helpful with directions (to the Golden Gate Bridge, AT&T Park, Alcatraz Cruise, etc) and dining recommendations. We want to single out Juan in particular for his assistance and interest in what we were doing. Juan even recognized us on the street and called to us by name as we were returning to the hotel and he was heading home for the night. After a poor experience with a concierge in San Diego, it was nice to deal with competent, engaging staff at The Omni. We enjoyed the location of The Omni \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an easy walk from BART/Muni, right on the California line cable car and within a few blocks of many bus routes. You can buy a Muni pass in the baggage claim areas at SFO - we used the passes often. We walked to Union Square as well as to the Ferry Building. The primary purpose of our trip was baseball \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we saw three Giants games. AT&T Park was about a 20 minute walk from the hotel. We took the Muni to the games, walked back. The area around the hotel was not busy late night after the games. We did not feel threatened at all, but we did have our wits about us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c paying attention to where we were going, watching who else was out and on at least one occasion crossing the street to the other side just to be safe. There are not many restaurants near the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ask for recommendations from the concierge staff. We did not do this the first few nights we were there, we wish we did. Consider the Royal Exchange, a few blocks away. We had an excellent early dinner before a Giants game there. We rented a car at the Budget counter in the Hyatt Embarcadero after checking out of the hotel. The bell staff held our bags until we could get back with the car \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we loaded up in front of the hotel and set off for Santa Cruz. I really do not have anything negative to say about our stay. I have stayed in more luxurious hotels and in larger rooms and suites \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some may stay the physical plant of The Omni is not a five star hotel and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I could argue the point. But the service is most assuredly five star quality. I would absolutely try to stay at The Omni if I returned to San Francisco \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but price would be a consideration. I am not sure how much I would pay to stay here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I would pay more to stay here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say for sure how much more.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Tx", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "TxTxAustin", "ReviewID": "UR118029083", "Content": "This is an absolutely fabulous location in the city.

The hotel lobby and the room were exquisite. Our room was on the 15th floor and had a partial view of the city. The bed was very comfortable. The room had a desk and a chair with an ottoman. The closet was fairly large and included a safe and bathrobes. Everything was very clean. The staff was great. They brought in cookies and milk every afternoon for my son. We requested a cot for my son because there was only 1 king size bed in the room (my mistake when booking). The cot was almost like a rolling twin size bed so my son slept very comfortably. On a Sunday night, when we asked the front desk staff for dining suggestion, instead of steering us to the hotel restaurant, they recommended a nearby tavern that was great (Wayfare Tavern, owned by Tyler Florence).

I will start by saying that I spend many hours deliberating TA- reading reviews on what hotels to choose and so far every one we have picked over the last few years based on recommendations from all you travellers out there from Prague to Chicago to Seattle has been pretty accurate. Thanks! So that leaves me without words on the Omni as I am not quite sure how to review this hotel. I suppose I am feeling a bit guilty about not being totally blown away. I think I was expecting much more considering its status on TA in the top 5 hotels in SF. We have stayed at many 5 star hotels and this was not one of them. First the service was very good- i commend them highly on this. Everyone from the doorman, to wait staff, to front desk and to housekeeping was very good- almost over the top. If this is what you are looking for then you will be happy. Also the location is pretty central too. If this is your first time to SF it will be good for a jumping off point. Now the tough part- the rooms were very small and a bit tired looking. I appreciate they are going for a Victorian Theme- but it need a bit of updating/refresh to make take it from dowdy to posh....what I would expect of 5 star. There was nothing about the room that spoke of a 5 star or set it apart- for example size, over the top bed, nice bath, view, or a great lobby bar, that kind of stuff. If i was traveling on business and needed to be in downtown SF I would stay again. But I would not return for a weekend getaway destination.

We were traveling with young children, and had requested a connecting room. As always, we would not have booked there if this wasn't a possibility. During our first leg of the journey, there was no problem. We had two lovely, connecting rooms, and the service was genial. We were struck by how expensive the restaurant was; we decided right away not to eat there if we could avoid it (and with the culinary delights of San Fran beckoning, didn't mind that too much). However, the one breakfast we did eat there was no fun. It took a while just to get water, and even longer to place our order (and even longer to get the food!). Our sweet waitress apologized profusely, and even management admitted to being very busy. (Please remember this was the week Hurricane Irene was traveling up the E. Coast, and many people were stranded.) When the food did arrive, it was wrong--my daughter's order was completely different, and mine was not what I'd been told it would be, even after very specific questioning. We also had a dinner there after being delayed one night, and it was okay. If you DO go to the restaurant (and you probably shouldn't), stick with the steaks, which are very good. Anyway, we had plans to check back in to the Omni on our return leg--like our initial reservations, these had been made two months in advance. Because of the hurricane (we live in NJ), we had to add another night to our reservation. That was all done with no problem. But when we checked back in, we were informed (after a lot of hemming and hawing) that we did not have connecting rooms. I asked why, and was told that it was OUR fault, that when we'd extended our stay, we'd forfeited our rooms--though no one told us this upfront, and it seemed really weird, like we were somehow being penalized for booking an extra night!!! At any rate, they offered to pay for one of the room, and told us we'd be moved to connecting rooms the next day (after having to pack and repack for our trip so often, by then, I could barely imagine doing it again). So, while i was far from happy, I took that as a gesture of good will... Then we got into our non-connecting rooms (meaning one adult would, of course, have to stay with one child). And guess what? One of those rooms had only a King bed--meaning an adult would have to sleep with one of the kids. Not only that, but the room we were given was pretty bad--right above the street, right above the entrance to the restaurant, dirty carpeting, cramped, etc. (NOTE: If you stay here, request high floors. Though the financial district is pretty dead at night and on weekends, it sits at the intersection of two very busy streets.) Again, after the manager did initially blame us for the problem, the hotel in general did try to make it up to us. They even paid for that regrettable breakfast mentioned above. But it felt pretty bad to be spending so much money there, to have done all OUR homework, and to be treated so badly. Furthermore, there wasn't a lot of value-added to this hotel. It would have been nice to have, for instance, an alternative, more casual, LESS expensive dining alternative (and forget about room service--it was absurd).

The location of the hotel (in the Financial District) was excellent as we could walk to many of the popular neighborhoods: we could get to the Embarcadero (and the all the yummy foods and the Ferry Building and awesome chocolates at Tcho on Pier 17), AT&T Park, North Beach (for Beach Blanket Babylon and TONS of coffee-a caffeine addict's paradise!), and Chinatown, no need for a car! What made this Omni so great (and why we continue to return to Omni Hotels) was the incredible service. The bellhops, front desk staff, and housekeeping were all so friendly. They answered tons of questions for us, directed us to restaurants, had nice treats for us at turndown, and even held our luggage for us on the day we checked out. We were even treated to a walking tour through Chinatown! My husband was trying to track down an old friend who he thought lived in the area and the front desk staff worked so hard to help him get phonebooks, do online searches, and call for information.

The snacks were above the fridge (just high enough to be out of sight of our little ones) and included cereal, skittles, m&ms. The drinks were 50 cents & the snacks $1.00. That was a pleasant surprise. Each afternoon, fresh cookies & milk were also delivered to our room. The kids loved the stay too & it took some coaxing to even get them to leave so we could explore the city.

I only write a review for Tripadvisor if I feel a hotel merits five stars. I know this is probably totally wrong as I should also review those of poorer quality. The problem is that I simply don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the time! Without any shadow of doubt the Omni merits five stars. It raises the bar in terms of customer service. From the moment I walked in to the moment I left I felt totally at home. I arrived after an eleven hour flight and transferred to the hotel from SFO by BART. The hotel is an easy and flat five block walk up Montgomery St from the BART station. Check in was very smooth and I was quickly in my room. It was spotlessly clean with a welcome note and complimentary bottle of water as I joined the Select Guest programme. I suggest that anyone staying at an Omni joins this. Complimentary Wi Fi, newspapers and morning beverages are just some of the benefits. It costs nothing to join and is well worth it. I had emailed ahead to request a quiet room and was allocated one overlooking the courtyard without any traffic noise at all. Not a great view but who cares? A quiet nights sleep is more important to me. The room did, however, back onto the elevator shafts so I was woken early whilst they were being used more frequently. The noise was not, however, that loud and most people would have taken absolutely no notice at all but I am obsessive about noise and a difficult person to please. The term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grumpy Old Man\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fits me perfectly or so my wife says! I asked at reception if the elevator noise always started around 6.00 and without me even asking I was immediately offered another room. The second room again overlooked the back and was so unbelievably quiet that I slept like a log for the next four nights. Facilities in the room were excellent. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. A big armchair and footrest were welcome after a day of San Francisco hill climbing! Wi Fi was fast and easy to connect. I was quite impressed with the workstation which had plug sockets built into it. Little things please little minds! All too often in other hotels I have had to scrabble round the floor looking for them. One thing that really impressed me was that the maid left a handwritten note to thank me for the tip I left her. I think it was a really nice touch. I always tip maids and this is the first time I have been thanked for it. I very much appreciated it. The hotel is located in the financial district which was very quiet over the weekend. Just a short walk to North Beach, Market Street and Embarcadero. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat or drink in the hotel so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on that side of things. There are plenty of great bars and restaurants nearby especially North Beach. Finally, I cannot complete the review without mentioning the standard of customer service again. This was exceptional in all respects. I have stayed in countless hotels over the years and the Omni is in a league of it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own. All the staff I encountered had a smile on their face and were amazingly polite. I never had to open the front entrance door or call for the elevator as one of the staff always rushed to do these. I originally planned to stay for ten nights but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the first five nights in view of illness in the family. It was such a delight to stay there that I really wish I could have made the full ten nights. Will I be back? Without any shadow of doubt. I am planning my next SF trip now.

The very well-trained staff provided exemplary service from the moment we walked in to when we left, and even after we checked out. You couldn't open the front door without someone rushing ahead to open it for you. The room is fairly spacious - not huge but ample for two people. Room decor was upscale - not top-end luxury but at $245 a night in San Francisco, very good value. Bed was very comfortable, and they provide robes and slippers. Bathroom was quite nice, not super luxury but very comfortable. The one flaw has been mentioned in other reviews: a single switch turns on the fairly bright lighting, which is not pleasant if you get up at night to use the bathroom. Hint: the lighted make-up mirror works great for that. The hotel is 2 block from Chinatown and a 10-minute walk from the Ferry Building - very good location. Parking, like everywhere in SF, is terribly expensive, but you can save a few bucks by parking across the street in the Bank of America garage.

A very warm welcome on arrival by the doormen and the reception staff also made you feel special by being very attentive without being over the top, we did get the immediate feeling that if there was anything you needed they would be more than glad to help. We had requested a quiet room with a view if available as this was a trip for our wedding anniversary and they certainly matched our request with a great room on the 17th floor. This is a city where a couple of the main features (as there are many parts to San Francisco) are a fantastic bay area & many steep slopes, but if you can cope with the slopes you get the payoff of great views. This is a great city, I love New York & I love Boston, but this is right up there and I'm still deciding if this has just gone to the top of the list. We stayed for 6 nights and in all honesty could have stayed more. If you are a tourist coming here you just have to do Alcatraz which we thought was brilliant, but be warned you need to book this before you get to the city as the trip is very busy and you cannot guarantee getting on a trip by just turning up on the day. We also did a Napa Valley tour (through Viator) which was also a great trip. The people in this city, and seemingley in California as a whole are warm, friendly and welcoming people who are glad to help and have a chat with you. The location of this hotel we felt was excellent. Nice area & turn left out of the main front door (not up the hill) and you are heading to the Ferry Building / Embarcadero & the many piers of the bay. Approx 10 minute flat stroll and you are at the Ferry Building & turn left when you get there and you are heading towards Pier 39 / Fishermans Wharf and the sea lions etc. This hotel is also only short walk to Union Square and the shops that are there. If you are up to it, biking over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito is well worth the effort. My wife and I (45 & 50 years old) managed it and the it will be a memory that stays forever as to view this iconic structure from such a close up and personal viewpoint is just awesome. We stopped frequently to take hundreds of photos, had lunch in Sausalito and then caught the ferry back which is really easy, as through Blazing Saddles they give you a ferry ticket ready for use in the morning, which you can either use or not. You pay for the bikes at the end of the trip & hence if you don't come back on the ferry you don't get charged for the ticket so long as you return it in full.

The gym is good-- they have free weights, about 6 treadmills and 4 elliptical machines. It is crowded in the mornings, but well-maintained and clean. One other slight negative-- there are only 2 elevators for the whole hotel. They are slow. In busy times, one can spend a lot of time waiting for an elevator.

I have to say that this hotel is the epitomy of professionalism. The door staff are polite and helpful, and the reception staff even more so. The room we had was probably the best we stayed in during our trip to Vegas and SF. It's got a very distinct touch of class about it (though not austentatious or showy like some hotels). The bed was large and comfortable, with a large flat screen TV and coffee machine (which didn't work properly). It had a nice big desk in the room as well as sofa chair and foot stool, and the bathroom was perfectly nice enough. We didn't see hide nor hair of the cleaners which was a complete contrast to the other hotel we stayed in where we were woken up early. It seemed as if they were invisible until the time when you left your room and came back and everything has been cleaned to perfection! The only slight annoyance (if you can call it that) was the turn down service, where they fold a corner of the bed and angle your pillows to face the window. Seemed a bit odd to me and rather pointless. If someone needs the corner of the bed to be folded down in order for them to get in, they probably need a psychiatric home and not a hotel! We got a really good deal through Expedia and paid less than \u00c2\u00a3100 per night, which I thought was good value for the quality of the hotel. We didn't eat in the Steak House restaurant as it was a tad pricey, and also be aware that room service can be expensive as well. It's fine if you arrive late and need some food, but there are plenty of other places to eat and it is within 5 minutes of Chinatown. The hotel location was good but not excellent. It's near to Market Street, but is a good 10 minute walk to Union Square as it is located in the Financial District. This also means that there aren't a lot of eateries nearby or shops like Walgreen's if you need to dash out for something. You'd be surprised how early things shut in SF!

We booked based on the good reviews, location and low price. Our room was ready when we arrived and we were given lots of helpful information by reception for our stay in San Francisco. The rooms are nice, not massive but big enough for two people. The hotel has an old fashioned luxurious feeling to it, different to the usual chains we have stayed at. We were disappointed slightly that the cable car was not running on California Street right outside the hotel, closed for refurbishment of the line. We would have liked to seen them running instead of the roadworks, but this was not the hotels fault. I do think Thomas Cook could have let us know about this before booking though. It was only a small inconvenience to our stay with there being trams a short walk away or another cable car at the top of the steep hill. We went all over in San Francisco and bought a 3 day travel pass from reception. We also went to see a Giants game which was good fun, concierge were very helpful sorting out the tickets for us. The hotel is in a good location in the financial district and a short walk to Union Square and all the shops, although being in the financial district did mean a few coffee shops and restaurants were closed over the weekend. We ate nearby at restaurants recommended by concierge and also in the hotel for lunch and dinner. The onion rings in the hotel restaurant show as a starter ($12) and look amazing. Be warned, the portions are massive and we struggled to eat them all, along with steaks for main course. My only small complaint is that I struggled to get english tea. There is fruit and earl grey tea in the rooms and free coffee downstairs for guests in the morning. They did get me english tea in the morning when I asked but made a point of saying I should really be charged as only coffee is free. The maid did her best to get me english tea for the room but I ended up with more earl grey! On our last day, they kindly stored the luggage for us until the afternoon when we left and then arranged for a hotel car to take us to the airport in style, rather than a taxi.

The hotel is part of Historic Hotels of America, and they offer discounts for members, but we got a special weekend rate from Omni that was less. Reasonable price for downtown SF. There's a fee for wireless internet service, but it's waived if you join the Omni rewards program (which you can do at any time, even after checking in).

We didn't use room service and never had to call housekeeping, so I can't review that. Robes were provided, and the tub is extra deep, which I loved after getting caught in a downpour down at Fisherman's Wharf. The bathroom is all marble, with Kohler fixtures, but watch those sink handles! They unscrew easily after being turned on and off, and will drop off onto the counter, or if you're unlucky, onto the glass soap dish or q-tip holder. The handles are heavy, and it's possible something could be broken. The two windows only open about six inches, for safety purposes. Street noise is minimal as long as the windows are kept closed. The heating unit in the room worked great and was not loud at all. We didn't try the A/C, of course. The king-sized bed was very comfortable, but firmer than we're used to. A good quality blow dryer in a drawstring bag hung in the bathroom, and an iron and board in the closet and a 32-inch flat screen tv for bedside viewing. A small coffeepot with quality coffee is provided. There is also a small portable fridge in the television armoir, to which you are given a key at check-in. You can use the fridge to store your own stuff if you want, but don't try to store too much. The fridge has a small amount of liquor, beer, wine, soda and sparkling water that the maid checks every day to see if you've used anything. If you don't want her digging through all your stuff to find their stuff, don't cram it full of your stuff. Unless you want to pay top dollar, don't drink the bottled water they leave out for you and don't eat any of their candy or drink anything from their fridge. Bring your own snacks and keep a six-pack of your favorite soda in the fridge. The restaurant in the hotel, Bob's Steak and Chop House is a fine restaurant. A little pricey, but worth it. If you want breakfast, you must be there before 10 am. Not easy for late risers like us. But if you miss it, the Subway right across the street next to the Wells Fargo serves breakfast sandwiches and has fresh hot coffee. Also, I highly recommend the Wells Fargo History Museum, since it's right there. The very site of the very first Wells Fargo. The cable cars were not running on California Street. That's the main reason I chose a hotel on a cable car line, so we could step out the front door and catch one. I checked SFMTA's website, and it said that due to construction, the entire California line will be shut down from January 3rd, 2011 until June 2011, so it should have been running while we were there. The hotel staff did not know why it was not. The hotel is non-smoking, so you'll have to go outside the hotel to do that, if you smoke. The windows don't open far enough to be of any use, and although you can remove the plastic stops to open the window all the way, there is a very real chance you would fall if you leaned out even a little, so I do not recommend this to smoke, or for any other reason. No, we did not try this. Parking at the hotel is valet only, and costs $48 a day. Outrageous! Do yourself a favor and find another garage. There are a couple nearby on Kearney. You can find web coupons if you're really into saving extra money. Lastly, do yourself a favor and leave your car parked. Buy a 3 or 7-day muni pass at the hotel desk. It's good for all types of bus, cable car and trolley car transportation throughout the city. There's also a discount at the Ghirardeli square chocolate store and the SF Zoo if you show your muni pass.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in San Francisco\u201d", "Author": "French_Australian", "ReviewID": "UR90956245", "Content": "We just checked-out from the hotel where we stayed 3 nights in San Francisco, the Omni.

It is a very nice and elegant hotel located on the corner of California and Montgomery, in the financial district of San Francisco. The location is great because it is a five minute (flat) walk to the Montgomery BART station, and a ten minute (flat) walk to the Ferry Building. Also, the California Street cable car line runs right in front of the hotel. The other two cable car lines are just a short walk away (a steep uphill walk though). So overall, its very easy to get to most tourist attractions in the city using public transportation. And of course, you can always just take a cab, as it only costs around $10 to get to Fisherman's Wharf. The service was great, the hotel staff was always willing to give advice on how to get from one place to another, and they seemed very knowledgable. The rooms themselves were big and clean.

However, those rooms are small and have views of only the backs of neighboring buildings. I looked at an interior room on the highest floor; its view was of the massive air conditioning unit of a neighboring building. Finally, the hotel's restaurant and parking are overpriced.

The front desk staff was incredibly accomodating, with recommendations of what to see and do and eat throughout the city and beyond. I had done some internet research on tours of wine country and Muir Woods before I left home, but ended up deciding that the tour company recommended by the hotel offered a better deal, and was easier to book since the front desk clerk took care of it. The tour company picked us up at the front door. Downsides: Parking is very expensive (as it is in any city), and the plush bathrobes are too heavy to walk around the room in.

From the moment we arrived it felt right. The welcome from reception staff (particularly Jake) was wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. The doormen were always so polite and always smiling and unlike many places in San Francisco, I didn't feel they were only being nice just to get a tip out of you. We stayed here for 3 nights initially on floor 5 and had a great view of California Street and the cable cars. The cable cars never disturbed us at all as they stop at a reasonable hour in the evenings and pass by the hotel quickly. Our room was fantastic, large, clean and comfortable and the bathroom had that wow factor with lots of marble and complimentary toiletries & lots of fluffy towels. In the wardrobe (closet), there were luxurious bathrobes to use during your stay, an iron and ironing board (useful as the airport luggage handlers squash your cases so much your clothes have creases where you didn't think they could have creases), plus a safe to keep your valuables in. The beds were soooo comfortable I wanted to take one back home with me - clean crisp sheets, clean crisp duvets and covers and lots of comfy pillows. After spending a few days out of town travelling other states we returned to the same hotel for the last few nights of our stay in San Francisco. This time we were on the top floor (floor 17) where the room was exactly the same layout but being so high you only had little windows and this slightly lost the fun of being on California Street as we couldn't see the street - only the buildings opposite. Being in the financial district had its pros and cons. Cons being there weren't that many places to eat around the hotel however there is a lovely new Irish bar just opened on Sacramento Street (about 2 minutes walk away) plus another restaurant next to it (can't remember the name but recommended by hotel staff). Also, as someone else mentioned, I felt a little out of place in casual wear when most other people were in business suits but this was mostly apparant during the day rather than at night. The pros of this hotel's location is that it's only 3 short blocks from the Montgommery Street BART stop and took us only 10 minutes to walk from the BART to the hotel. Another good point about the hotel being in the financial district is that (unlike every other part we went to - particularly the tourist parts) you didn't get any 'down-and-outs' hassling you for money as the businesses and hotels in the area don't take kindly to the down-and-outs hassling their clients. It all felt very safe around the area. I don't know if it's a sign of the financial downturn at the moment, but be warned if you are out and about in general San Fran - there are a LOT of beggers / down-and-outs / homeless / drunks constantly trying to get money out of you and it gets a bit tiring after a while.

We took the Bart rail system from the airport which stops 3 blocks away and walked to the hotel with our cases which only took a few minutes. On arrival we were tired with the long journey and there was a hiccup with our room as we had booked our room through Hotels.com. I had booked a room with 2 double beds some months earlier . We were told straightaway on arrival at the hotel that when you make such a booking through the internet the spec.of the room cannot be guaranteed. We were shown to a room with just one king bed in and were told a fold away bed would have to be added for my son which we weren't happy about. This was going to be a 4 night stay. The desk manager quickly found a double bed room for us which needed cleaning and were given a complimentary drink in the bar while the room was being cleaned. I tipped the bell hop Marlin to take our bags to the room for us while we were having our drink but after 3 hrs the bags never arrived. I went back downstairs to find Marlin had gone home without delivering my bags and his relief had to deliver my bags without any further tip being given which I felt awkward about but I didn't see why I should have to tip again. After this our stay was problem free and we found this hotel was placed fantasticaly to tour the surrounding area. The trams on Knob Hill are just outside the hotel, Chinatown just a couple of streets away and the fishermans wharf areas are a nice 10 minute stroll away. The hotel itself tends to be occupied by well dressed business type people and at times I felt a bit out of place dressed in shorts/\"t\" shirt . This hotel is sitauted in the Banking district with very tall high rise office blocks nearby. Fresh fruit and a drinks urn containing water with lemons in were available every evening next to the lift. Free wi=fi is available in the reception area. The hotel is spotlessly clean and cannot be faulted. San Francisco was found to be cold most times with the cold Pacific breeze from the sea and we had to wear light fleeces most of the time which I didn't expect in August. We done the normal Alcatraz tour and city bus tour which is a must do. We walked all around the area and despite the high number of homeless tramps in the town we felt safe. Having said that a German female tourist celebrating her silver wedding was accidently shot dead a couple of blocks away as the result of being caught in crossfire from some youths who had fallen out at a nearby disco ! This made us cautious but appears to have been a one off incident. But after our 4 day stay we moved onto Las Vegas and then onto New York.

This is a true 5 star hotel with friendly concierge and faultless service. If I were to pick one small point - it would have been great if the breakfast had been a buffet rather than a la carte. Whilst the food was very good the menu is quite limited and one of the waiters was curt, bordering on rude. $80 a day for breakfast gets a little steep after a few days! There are plenty of other places around to get breakfast so not a big issue. The beds are really comfortable, the rooms large, the towels soft and the staff attentive.

The Omni was the perfect choice and had a great deal going for 2 weekend nights at around $150 a night (which we got from Expedia.) I later read on Omni's website that they will match and beat any published price as long as you first book your stay on their own website. That's pretty cool. Getting back to the important stuff...the hotel is beautiful. It's not huge compared to other high end places around Union Square or the Embarcadero area, but 'just right' in our book. The lobby, elevators and general interior is impeccably clean. The room we stayed in wasn't huge, but it worked just perfectly for the 2 of us. The bed was comfortable and pillows were ample and of the highest quality. Needless to say, we both got great nights sleep during our stay. Probably the most impressive aspect of the hotel is the staff. They are truly wonderful people, very friendly without being overbearing (I can't stand dealing with hotel staff that act snobbish and just go through the motions solely to get that tip). The staff at the Omni are genuinely friendly, and seem to relish in sharing any information they find on new and fun things to do in the city. It was almost as if we were around good friends than your typical hotel staff. Another important thing is to go on the Omni website and sign up for their free 'Select Guest' program, which will automatically allow you to customize your room preferences, free WiFi (great!), complimentary morning beverages (2 per person), complimentary pressing (2 items) and shoe shine, express check in/check out, and an evening turn-down service as well. All that for the grand total of $0.00. Don't forget to sign up! We did not use room service, nor did we eat at the Steak house that is inside the hotel.

There are less expensive alternatives through room service. Bagel and cream cheese was $5 and bacon, egg and cheese sandwich was $8. A few other things too.

The gym was a good size also. Towels, water and earphones available.

The citrus water is a great touch after a long day. However we picked up the keys to our room on the 10th floor and was so disappointed. The room was small as I expected (no different from NYC), but what i wasn't prepared for was the NASTY carpet. This carpet was dirty outside the room in the hall and so nasty on the inside I would not have walked on it without my shoes. The ottoman on the chair was frayed and had dirty spots on it. I went back to the front desk. Received an apology and was given a different room. We went to our room on the 12th floor and it was better but not much. The furniture is cherry wood with nicks on it. The lamps do not have built in electrical plugs so if I want to use my computer while in bed, I have to unplug the clock. The desk has outlets for internet and electricity, but again the lamp on the desk does not have an electrical outlet. The chair and ottoman are in better shape than the room on the 10th floor, but one can tell it could use a good steam cleaning as well. The beds are comfortable. The sheets are clean and white. But the duvet cover does not have the same crisp white look or smell. Nice flat screen TVs and large bathrooms with a pocket door. San Francisico is definitely cooler than the South, but the room goes from stuffy to cool. I cut the temperature to 71 but it still is rather warm. Another thing, I used the iron board and had to run because we were late, but when we returned to the room the iron board was right were we had left it even though the room had been made up. I have never had that happen not even in a Days Inn. One more thing. I signed up for their loyalty program and received free internet. However, I am going to have to remind them at checkout that I shouldn't have to pay for the internet. But get this, I was having trouble getting on the internet and called the internet help line. I got a voicemail and was told to leave my name and number and she would call back. Not good service for the internet. Again, the customer service at this hotel is outstanding from the front desk and other employees. The location is in the financial district so it is away from the touristy Union Square. Also, there is a great restaurant down the street called Tadick Grill. It's the oldest restaurant in San Francisco and the food (especially the seafood) is the best!! Honestly, I received a great rate on this hotel and love the customer service, but I don't think I will stay here again until they make some changes in cleanliness.

I spoke with Tofique at the front desk and asked about my preference, after some chatting he asked was their any 'special' reason we were coming that weekend. I said 'Yes, it's our 20th anniversary'. He then asked if he could upgrade us as a surprise for my spouse, of course I said Yes, Please!.

Although there was only 1 waiter and he was a bit overwhelmed (staff had called in sick), he made me the best hot choc and rec a wonderful breakfast which was more suitable for two!

As for room size, amenities, and overall hotel luxury, the Omni is a solid 4-star hotel; however, the service more than compensates for that missing 5th star. The service was personable (the valets repeatedly addressed us by name), generous, unpretentious and sincere throughout our stay. The drawbacks of the Omni should be mentioned: (1) there's little to no view from any of the rooms; the hotel is unfortunately surrounded by tall(er) buildings -- so if you're looking for a grand view of the Golden Gate or Bay bridge, this is probably not the hotel for you; (2) we had to pay for bottled water in the room whereas many top hotels provide 2 bottles of free water/day (pet peeve: if a hotel is not going to provide drinkable/filtered tap water, then it shouldn't charge for bottled water); (3) internet access was not free -- we ended up joining the Omni frequent guest program (no charge) just so we could get the free internet. Otherwise, I cannot emphasize how wonderful the Omni staff was. They truly made our vacation more enjoyable. (PS: got a great rate via hotel website that included valet parking and tickets to the de Young museum -- definitely a bargain!)", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wimbledon", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Hotel for our needs\u201d", "Author": "MissWhitey", "ReviewID": "UR67805313", "Content": "This hotel is located in the financial district, but only a short walk from the bars and restaurants of North Beach, and also the shops of Union Square.

I don't like the location as much as some other hotels, but it's still close by. Email below: I believe I've stayed at an Omni hotel (not the SF one) in the past, but definitely not since I became a regular business traveler, as I have been for the past 3.5 years. I usually travel 2 to 8 times per month, and I've stayed at a variety of 4 stars around the country (primarily SF, NYC, Boston, Dallas, Chicago, LA and Seattle). As one of two partners in my firm, I will admit cost is a large driving factor in choosing hotels (since T&E comes straight out of my pocket), so I'm a member of nearly all Hotel reward programs out there. For some reason, however, it's taken until this week before I joined Omni's Select Guest program. I can say with absolute certainty that it is the best hotel rewards program out there for any \"chain\" hotel. While I've seen one or two of the benefits you offer (free wireless and free water bottles) at other hotels, but the total combination of items that I care about as a business traveler (free clothes pressing, free shoe shine, free beverages in the morning, free water bottle in the evening, and pre-check-in/guaranteed room) make the Select Guest program almost too good to be true. On top of that, the fact that it's only 5 stays or 10 nights to get a free room AND only 6 (I think) nights before I move up to the next tier in your program DOES make it too good to be true. I've already sung praises of your program to 3 people, and I just checked out of the hotel this morning. In addition, another pleasant surprise was a gentlemen at the front desk named Stephen (a caucasian, bald man around 6ft tall), who was not just friendly, but one of the most informative front desk people I have come across. He also clearly remembered me the next morning and was just as helpful. I've never written an email to a hotel manager to praise their hotel, but the combination of the two topics above drove me to do so. It looks like I'll be in San Francisco 1 to 2 nights per week for the next 3 months, and as long as I can make it fit in our budget, I look forward to staying at your hotel.

Room service was prompt and the food was delicious, the wait staff in the dining room graciously accommodated our swelling ranks as various family members wandered in for breakfast over the course of several hours one morning (we were all in town for a wedding), and the doormen treated us like they'd known us forever (and liked us for just as long). The room was graciously appointed, quiet and clean and nicely laid out, with plenty of storage and excellent housekeeping.

Our most recent comparison is the JW Marriott which is, overall, much better than the Omni. I will compare the two properties as we used them for similar purposes, stayed identical amounts of time, and paid about the same. We joined the Omni Select Guest program, which is underwhelming. We got Internet (which only worked on one of the two days we were there), two bottles of water the first night, and the morning beverage delivery (the coffee was really hot- outstanding). On the other hand, we paid about $30 more a night than at the JW, so those Select Guest perks aren't really \"free\". As for the other \"perks\", no one offered them to us or took the time to explain the procedures for things like \"free pressing\" which we could have used since we were headed to the symphony one night. We didn't get, nor were we offered, any type of upgrade as others have mentioned. Every time we have stayed at the JW we were given a slight upgrade to a \"view\" room. We were not contacted ahead of time, not even by email. Hilton, Marriott and Kimpton all do that, just to see if there is anything they can do to prepare for your arrival. We are not demanding guests, and have never asked for anything special. Still, it is a nice touch to acknowledge your arrival ahead of time. The Omni room was really small, and fairly shabby.(my husband described the style as a \"Ritz Wannabee\". There were stains on the carpet, and the furniture is dated. There was no real desk chair so it would not be a comfortable place if you had a lot of work to do. There was a coffeemaker, but no place to put it to plug it in other than have it sit on the floor. The bathroom is TINY, a tub/shower combo with only one sink and no storage. I had to to use the luggage stand propped up under the sink for my cosmetic bag. In contrast, the JW Marriott bathrooms are huge, with separate tub/shower and double sinks. Both hotels have opening windows (a big plus as city hotels are often hot). The JW rooms are less shabby, and they have a Herman Miller Aeron chair at the desk. They also have updated furniture. A flat screen can't be viewed well when used inside one of those old-fashioned entertainment centers which is what the Omni still has. The JW location near Union Square is more convenient, but also much noisier for sleeping. The car service is similar at both places, it took a little longer at the Omni than at the JW to get our car. There are of course, way more places in Union Square to eat on the weekends than in the financial district. If you have a Muni pass, the accessibility to the cable car at the Omni is excellent- they should probably offer a Muni pass as part of a package to help compensate for the lack of weekend restaurants in the neighborhood. Both hotels have uneven service, but I would have to say that the Omni really comes up short here. In fact, the poor/ rude service we experienced at the Omni is what prompted this review. We were standing at the concierge desk waiting to buy Muni day passes. Another couple came off the elevator,and the concierge (a middle-aged man) called out to them and encouraged them to come over. He then completely ignored us, didn't even bother to say something like \"I will be with you in a minute.\". He started into a long-winded conversation about helping them get Giants tickets. We finally left, really put off by how rude he was to ignore guests standing in front of him in deference to people just randomly walking by. Another example of rude/oddness was when I went down to the front desk to get an extra Select Guest \"free beverage\" cards. No one explained them to us at check-in and I falsely assumed we filled one out for each of us. Turns out you get one card and fill it out for both guests. So, I went downstairs to get another ticket. The guy at the front desk was named Richard- I think. He ignored me, but a friendly and knowledgeable bellman (I think his name was Darrel) immediately offered to help me. I told him I just needed to speak to the man behind the desk. He beckoned the guy (\"Richard\") behind the front desk, who responded by walking away into a back room. A few seconds later he reappeared, and was on the phone. He looked up to me and said \"Richard is on the phone.\"- referring to himself in the third person like \"Jimmy\" on Seinfeld. Again, not even a nod, or a \"I will be with in just a minute\". Fortunately, the gracious bellman went and got a beverage ticket for me. He was a real jewel, as were every single one of the doormen, bellmen, and general staff milling around. This fine group of gentlemen went out of their way to provide continuing gracious service to all guests everytime we were in the lobby. However, the front desk staff we encountered are a genuine liability. In summary, we will not choose the Omni again. It really didn't represent a very good value. Should we stay in the financial district again, we will try the Le Meridian.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frederick, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel With Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "Maryland77", "ReviewID": "UR62318393", "Content": "We stayed at the Omni for four nights in April.

I have several tips for travelers: (1.) go the Omni site and review their discounted packages before making your reservation; (2.) ask for a free room upgrade before check-in; (3.) if you are staying over a weekend, don't miss the free San Francisco City Guides walking tour that is supported by the hotel. (1.) We got a package from the Omni's website that included parking, breakfast and VIP tickets to the King Tut exhibit at the de Young Museum. At $224/night, this was a bargain. Parking could have cost $40 a night alone and the hotel's breakfast could have cost over $60 per day for the two of us had it not been included. Because we are members of the Omni Select program, we got two beverages each delivered to our room in the mornings, free internet and free bottles of water. Very nice! (2.) At check-in, I requested a complimentary room upgrade and we got a very large room with a sitting area w/flatscreen and a very comfortable king bed (also with a flatscreen in an armoire near the foot of the bed). (3.) Don't miss the complimentary guided walking tours every Saturday at 10 am provided by San Francisco City Guides. Our tour of Chinatown started right in the hotel lobby and featured San Francisco history, architecture, legends and more. Our tour was about two hours long (you don't have to stay for the whole tour though) and was a super easy walk. Although it was hilly, we stopped often and the pace was just right. It was a wonderful experience! One final comment about the SF Omni: My husband and I wanted to get two full days of tours in but had not booked anything. Justin, the assistant front desk manager, took the time -- sharing his expertise and patience -- to help us plan two full days of tours and dining. He called and made reservations at each stop for us, provided maps and directions and even helped us work out the timing to make sure transportation between each stop was smooth.

I first stayed 2 years ago with my teen daughter as a mid-week getaway. This time I went with my spouse who had one day of business in SF so we decided to do a long weekend. We checked in on a Thursday and left (reluctantly) Sunday. I love the location -- easy walking distance to Chinatown, North Beach, Union Square, the Ferry building. Also easy to take the cable car back up California Street from Embarcadero. Only caveat is, on the weekend. most of the immediately local sandwich/soup shops are closed, catering as they do to local business lunchers. Our room was very nice, if a little quirky. It was on the top (17th) floor and was a suite with a separate living room. I say quirky only because the windows were all small and very high up so they let in the light but you could not really look out. We didn't care -- to us it was charming and comfortable The bathroom was nicely appointed with marble and an extra large shower and some fresh roses in a vase - a very nice touch. We splurged on a breakfast at Bob's -- the Eggs Benedict were (was?) among the best I've had. Our room service breakfast was very good as well. We are part of the free Omni loyalty program. In 2008 this got you free internet, plus free continental breakfast. This year they cut out the breakfast, giving you only coffee and juice of your choice. Still nice. The lobby is beautiful and the staff always courteous and helpful. I also appreciated the hot cider they have in the afternoons. We used the gym which has a nice view of California Street and the cablecar. It's clean and well-equipped if small, but I will say the treadmill I used (the one on the right as you enter the room) was very noisy and I remembered I used the same one in 2008 and apparently it hadn't been fixed.

From the moment I walked in the door, the service was uniformly outstanding. The doorman asks for the name on the reservation - and from there, they hand you off, by name, from staff member to staff member. I was particularly impressed when the next morning, the bellman still referred to me by name - good memory! The room I had was probably not the best location, but I didn't expect their best room for the price I paid! The room itself was lovely, extremely well equipped. It faced inwardly to other rooms of the hotel and a nearby office, but frankly that was wonderful because it was extremely quiet for sleeping. The location of the Omni in the center of town does not lend itself to views in any case. When I checked in, they gave me door tags to hang each night with a requested beverage (coffee, tea, juice, etc) for the morning. What I particularly liked was that on the back, you could also order small breakfast items - muffins, yogurt, etc. for a very reasonable price rather then ordering an expensive breakfast from the room service menu. If you were happy enough with coffee and a muffin for breakfast, it was possible for a very small charge.

I used a third party booker (starts with Price and ends with Line) and got an amazing deal on the Omni. I was very happy, because Omni is one of the highest ranked hotels in San Francisco. Now I know why. The Omni is located in the Financial District, which means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fairly short distance from touristy spots such as Union Square, Embarcadero, Chinatown and Pier 39. It also seems relatively safe. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, both dinner style and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grab something quick\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like Jamba Juice and Subway. Upon arrival, I realized I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d forgotten my phone charger. The front desk clerk, seeing that I was a little upset, offered to check housekeeping for a loaner. Five minute later she came back with a charger and said I could use it for the duration of my stay. Her helpfulness plus the cheery, happy, glad-to-be-at-work vibe given off by the rest of the employees in lovely lobby got my stay off to a good start. I had to wait a half hour for my room, which was no big deal since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d arrived earlier than 3. One of the most cheerful porters I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever encountered took my bags and held them while I ran to get some lunch. When the room was ready, I was surprised at how large it was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially considering I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d booked third party. Omni didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discriminate and attempt to put me in the broom closet, which to be honest, has happened only once at a different hotel where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d booked through the bargain booker. The room had a very long hallway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so long I could run laps back and forth. The bathroom was huge, the bed was big and comfy (as usual for Omni) and the room had a sofa, desk, chest of drawers and two flat screen TVs which could be adjusted so that I could view them from about any point in the room. The room didn't have a lot of light, but it didn't bother me, and the view was of people working in the offices in the building next door, which wasn't scenic, but slightly entertaining. As for the noise level, the only noise I ever heard coming from another room was a shower in a nearby bathroom. Overall, the room was very quiet. So the location was great, service was outstanding and the room exceeded my expectations. Room service prices were very, very expensive, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to be expected. However, I was able to order from the bar at the restaurant downstairs (Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) and take the food back up to the room. That cut the costs down tremendously and the cobb salad I ordered was excellent. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to go back to San Francisco for a longer stay at The Omni, and hopefully, with family. I read they have a kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 suite with bunk beds attached to a king suite. Final Note: Omni's Internet was free to members. To be a member, you just sign up on their website or when you get to the hotel. It's free and you get free Internet access.

My husband and I have never been to San Fran and we came with 5 others for fun. On the day we arrived we came in late from the airport and had 30 minutes to get to Pier 33 for the night Alcatraz tour. Thank goodness for Michael at the front desk, he not only checked us in, took all of our bags and had us all whisked away in time to make the tour. That was just the beginning! Every morning Joey at the font desk would greet us and ask whats on the agenda today. Well he made lots of suggestions and was very helpful in teaching us how to take the cable cars to the Piers, which was very easy. It picks you up right in front of the hotel and you take it to Powell street. On Powell you can either take the Hyde Cable car or the Mason. They both take you to the water at the different spots but the Hyde takes you to Lombard Street where you can get off and walk down the famous street and its only a couple of blocks to the Pier. For us taking the cable cars and walking around was the best way to see and experience the life down there. Parking would be crazy, so if your able to walk, that is what I recommend. We also did the Night cruise to Alcatraz. We bought our tickets a month in advance and believe me if we hadn't we would not of been able to go. It is definately worth the price and a great tour! We also top the Hop on Hop off Bus tour over the Golden Gate Bridge. It was ok I was a little disappointed that we got on the wrong bus and didn't get to go to Salsalito. Once your on they do no transfers so your stuck on the bus going where its going. It wasn't bad we went to the Exploratorium, the Presidio, over the bridge and the Pacific Heights Mansions. It was nice but really heard that Salsalito was a great town to go to! Other than that the Bread from Boudini's and the seafood is Awesome! We went to a show in North Beach, Beach Blanket Babylon and thought that it was great! Different, funny with great costumes and the humor was with all the current events that are going on today and Singing. If your up for a funny show you will have to get your tickets ahead of time for this too! Had no problems taking the BART to and from the airport. Hotel was just 5 blocks away. A special thanks to Joey and Michael at the Omni for always helping and going way out of their way to make our stay better!

We called ahead to find out more about the BART system and the concierge, Tara was very helpful. Mass Transit is the way to go in San Fran! Of course you must take advantage of the infamous Trolley cars (NOTE: pick up the trolley in the morning one block down from the hotel. You can buy tickets on-board. Otherwise, you will wait nearly an hour to get on the trolley at Powell Street or at Ghiradelli Square. Don't forget the MUNI. It is great too!! We took the MUNI to Haight/Ashbury and walked to Golden Gate park. The BART is fantastic to go to and from the airport. It cost $16.20 round-trip from SFO to Montgomery Street. The hotel is 5 blocks from the BART station. Don't waste your money on a $50 cab fare one-way! Anyway, we were greeted by Justin who check us in. We did not have any issues with check-in as some other people had indicated in other reviews. Justin was very friendly and cordial. He recommended a restaurant close by (Tadich Grille) so we had a quick dinner. Justin called some tour companies for us as we wanted to see Alcatraz. NOTE: If you plan on seeing Alcatraz PLEASE book your tickets in advance. I had been to SF ten years ago and never had a problem getting tickets to Alcatraz. I was told SF is so popular now that Alcatraz is sometimes booked for 3 weeks! We ended up getting tickets but it was by pure luck!! If you want to book tickets in advance, the Alcatraz ticket agent told me to book on the official Alcatraz website NOT a broker. We saw people turned away because their tickets from a \"broker\" weren't valid. All of the staff were very friendly and knowledgable at the Omni. We booked a 21-day advance so we got the best rate. Albeit, the rooms were a little small but VERY nice. The bathrooms are very nice with granite countertops and VERY clean as well. The lobby was nice with complimentary coffee. The hotel is a short walk or trolley ride to Chinatown and North Beach (Little Italy). Please check out Calzones in North Beach. It's a great Italian restaurant. It sounds like a pizza place but it's not. They have great food! Albeit, I don't think you can go wrong at any of the Italian restaurants. They all have outdoor cafe style seating. The Omni is in the financial district so there isn't alot of nightlife (which we liked). It was very quiet at night. If you want a hotel closer to bars or entertainment you might want to find something closer to Union Square.

The concierge, Lex ,was incredibley helpful. The room was well-appointed and the bed with crisp sheets and duvet very comfortable. Sign up for Omni' frequent stay program and enjoy benefits on your first stay including complimentary beverage (you can choose both coffee and juice/bottled water per person) and choice of newspaper delivered each morning at the time you choose. Yes - the bar and restaurant are on the expensive to the OMG side - especially if you dive into the steak menu at dinner ($54 for a veal chop - wow!) but have to say I had a wonderful burger in the bar one night and did not begrudge the $19 price tag because it was so good. Breakfast was also pricey (and not as outstanding) but you can add pastries, fruit and even a breakfast sandwich on to your complimentary breakfast beverage order for not too big a hit so we went that route and enjoyed a more affordable breakfast in our room. As for location, you cannot beat this spot for convenience to the Ferry Building, Union Square, China Town and all other points. Buy a three-day pass ($18) from the front desk and you can ride the trolley (stops right in front of the hotel), the vintage buses and regular buses to your hearts content. Also, if you plan to go to the Tut exhibit, ask the concierge if they have any leftover VIP passes. They cost a few bucks more but you can go whenever you want and bypass the long line by using the VIP line once inside the museum - you just have to promise the concierge that you will be discreet and not a big blowhard about having a VIP pass.....", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cA Class Act......\u201d", "Author": "Clubu", "ReviewID": "UR39520599", "Content": "The staff at the Omni is an efficient, attentive, and welcoming group of individuals.

The Hotel is located in the Financial District a short distance from the more chaotic tourist areas but easily accessible to world class shopping, eating, Fishermans Wharf , Chinatown and other scenic areas by walking, cable car, taxi, bus or rail. From the doorman, check in staff, bellman, concierge, housekeeping and restaurant, everyone warmly greeted us upon coming and going and always thanked us for staying with them. They went out of their way to be helpful with really good attitudes. We joined the select guest program for free (on their website) and this entitled us to FREE In-Room Internet Service, coffee/beverages of choice every morning, with a choice of 1 of 4 newspapers along with delivery of ice and turn down service in the evening. Upon making the reservation I mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday and when we arrived in our room, there was a card, birthday desert and bottle of chilled champagne waiting. We were in a regular room but I did request the top floor away from the elevator and got exactly what I asked for. The room was very clean - something I'm very picky about, beds were extremely comfortable and housekeeping service replaced our towels and promptly cleaned our room and bathroom every day when we left to go sightseeing. A concierge was usually available to make dinner reservations or tour arrangements, transportation and help with directions, areas to avoid, etc. They were always busy but always polite and willing to help. We ordered room service one evening and also ate in the hotel lounge. Delicious food and again great service. Bob's Chophouse, the main restaurant in the Hotel was very pricey so we chose to eat at more moderately priced meals in the different city districts. OTHER: Be prepared to tip. No pool. Nice fitness room. Good conference hotel. Family friendly. Parking is $48 per night, but if you have to have a car, there are a few less expensive garages nearby to park.

We got great advice when we asked for transport assistance or places to eat. The location of this hotel is great for catching cable cars & getting to Union Square. It is in the financial district but that is one of the reasons it is classy and quiet after hours. (As opposed to Fishermans Wharf which was insanely noisy.)

They were polite and would say welcome back. Darryl would even ask how your outing was. The front desk always said hello to me and my mom as we descended the stairs in the lobby. The room was clean and comfortable. The bath was very nice indeed. The room service was excellent in taste and value. My mom liked the tea they used so much I had to go online to order some for her. I personally loved the blueberry muffins with honey. Some people might say $4 plus tax and gratuity is expensive but go try to buy one at another establishment. It would cost about the same and is not near the quality or quantity. I have traveled coast to coast about 45 times and abroad twice, some was business and some pleasure. Some of the hotel/motels cost $40 a night and some $500. In those stays I have NEVER encountered the service as I did at the Omni San Francisco. I even took mom inside 3 big name hotels at the Wharf to compare our value and we knew we had made the right decision immediately. None of the hotels had a doorman available, the concierge was either aloof or rude (and yes I asked for 'directions'), and no one said hello as we entered. Also, when we left, I noticed there was no one to call a cab.

The parking at the hotel is $50. If you do not need a car, do not drive to this hotel. Besides, the cable cars are right outside the hotel, or you can walk to many sights. The other complaint is that there is no shopping around the hotel. Everytime I come to San Francisco, I have a long shopping list from friends and family.

I would recommend the California Academy of Sciences as a 1/2 day event. It is the new aquarium, rainforest, museum, planetarium and living rooftop exhibit. Great restaurants in the area: Hang An for chinese food on Clay, NorthBeach pizza delivers to the hotel, there is now a Cheesecake Factory in Union square, and many great Italian Places in North Beach to eat.

A note about the french fries for kids: ask for un-seasoned fries if your kids don't like them flavoured with herbs.

This is what you should expect and what you pay for in a four-star hotel. If you like \"old elegance\" this is the place for you. The location is great and the area around the hotel is very clean. We booked a sigature room based on the reservations agent description of it. It was not worth the extra money. It was on the sixteenth floor and overlooked Montgomery St but was so high you couldn't see the street, just old rooftops. There was no advantage in being so high up but the major disadvantage was the long waits for elevators. We found the staff to be very nice. Housekeeping was OK- skipped our room once so we didn't have our room done until after we left for the evening. Some days we recceived the number of towels we should have and other days we didn't. We received the fresh fruit and bottled water two of the four days. There were not many hotel guests while we were there. When I booked our room I inquired about the \"in-room\" safe size and was told my 15.4\" laptop would fit in it. This was not the case and everytime we went out we had to take it to the front desk to be locked in security and then wait again to retrieve it upon return - a major inconvenience. When we first discovered this upon checking in we spoke to the on-duty manager who said they were in the process of renovating the rooms and the renovated rooms will receive larger safes. He did not offer to move us to a renovated room nor compensate us with a complementary breakfast or the like for our inconvenience. The on-site restaurant is so over-priced it is comical. We had breakfast there twice and each time there was a major problem. We finally switched to room service - something we never do. . After we got home I checked our credit card bill and found some odd charge. I called the hotel and it was a mini bar charge, which we didn't use.

Our view from the window was not good, but this didn't bother us. We were there during an unusually warm time and I felt the air conditioner could have worked better.

We booked an entire vacation on Hotwire and paid a little more to stay at the Omni only because I'd always wanted to stay there. Little did I know what an experience we were in for. We checked in on Saturday night. Crystal at the front desk immediately upgraded us to a concierge floor room. She was genuinely friendly, professional and outgoing. Check-in was quick and easy. The room was elegantly furnished. The only drawback was that it seemed small. We were there for eight nights and we found that it lacked storage for all of our clothes. I think for a shorter stay, the room would've been absolutely perfect. From the bellman to the front desk attendants to the valets to the doormen to the room service people, the service was nothing less than spectacular. Everyone remembered our names, what room we were in, had our car waiting for us in a timely manner. We had breakfast at Bob's Steak House one morning. The french toast is to die for and the portions are big. Though the food seemed expensive, the portion size made up for the price. The room was appointed with a plasma TV, king size bed with down comforter. We had turn down service nightly with water and fresh fruit waiting for us when we returned from the day out. We had drinks of our choice and newpapers waiting at our door every morning. The hotel was originally a bank that was gutted and rebuilt in early 2000's. It was beautiful on the inside and out. It didn't seem overcrowded at all. As a matter of fact, it seemed nearly empty most of the time we were there. It is located on California Street @ Montgomery, on the California Street Cable Car Line and in the heart of the Financial District. I liked this location because it was out of the way of all of the tourist traps and it was nice to come home at night to a quiet, much more relaxed environment. Though we are planning to move back to San Francisco in the coming year, I do believe that I will stay at the Omni again before we move and I will definitely, definitely suggest it to anyone coming for a visit.", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "marbellany", "ReviewID": "UR22005651", "Content": "We stayed at the Omni for 4 days and we had an excellent experience.

Had a partial bay view room, very nice size, perfect size bathroom didn't have any complaints about that at all. The hotel is in walking distance to the ferries that will take you over to Sausalito. Union Square, and Chinatown are within walking distance too. If you needed to catch a cab all you had to do was ask one of the doormen and you had one in a flash.

The hotel is convenietly located in the Financial district within walking distance of Union Square, Fishermans Warf etc. Our room on the 5th floor did not have a great view but was very quiet and well worth sacrificing the view for. The rooms are in excellent condition, and the maid service is first class. The staff are very helpul and courteous at all times, ensuring our stay went without a hitch. The only small complaint we have is that the one and only bar in the hotel (Bobs bar) is very small and gets very crowded from approx 5pm onwards, and getting a seat was almost impossible around those times. However it is no reason not to stay here. When we first arrived after our lengthy journey from Scotland, we were informed that our room (booked and paid for 8 months previousley) had been cancelled by Octopus travel who we had booked the room through. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful in rectifying the situation. San Francisco is well worth a visit and has plenty to offer for all. We would recommend visiting Alcatraz and taking the coach tour of the city, however book your Alcatraz tickets online as far in advance as possible to ensure you get the dates you require. We also hired bikes from Blazing Saddles and rode over the Golden Gate bridge to Tiburon via Sausilto. This is a fantastic way to see the bridge and surrounding area (weather allowing). Sausilto is a must see when you are there and can be accessed by Ferry if you prefer not to bike it, dining is recommeded at Angelino's while you are there. We also took a wine tour to Napa valley etc and would recommend this trip, with plenty of samples included in the day ensuring the hoilday spirit was flowing. Union square is packed with all the usual big name shops, but visit the hippy district at upper Haight street for some of the funkiest shops available. We visited the zoo but found it to be dated and shabby with many of the animals not available to view. Of course you must take a ride on a tram while you are there, we would advise getting a day pass for 11 bucks, which allows you to hop on and off all day at your leisure. Finally Lombard St aka the most crookidest street in the world is worth a look with camera in hand. We had 2 days of cloud followed by 8 days of glorious sunshine while we we there.

Our room was nice although we had a few problems phone would not stop beeping and was very loud and annoying,safe was broken and so was the plug in the sink. We reported these faults to the front desk straight away and these faults were dealt with immediatey. When I expressed my disspointment with the faults in our room Richard on the front desk was very apologetic but was unable to move us as the hotel was full due to the Oracle convention being in town but that he would report our concerns to his manager. That evening when we got back to our room there was a letter of apology and a free breakfast voucher which was a nice touch. Our room was spacious with a large flat screen t.v and large comfortable bed the bathroom was again very spacious and very clean.

The lady that checked-us in, Crystal, was superb!!!They made a number of reservations for us and provided excellent recommendations. It's not close to the touristy areas near Fisherman's Wharf, but I wasn't looking to be in the heart of a tourist haven. If you are looking for a great hotel, with excellent service that makes you feel like you are at home this is the place to be.

It was our first trip to San Francisco, so we weren't sure of which area to stay in, but the Omni turned out to be perfectly located for us. It's in the Financial District, so it's quiet at night, but we felt perfectly safe walking there after dark. It's also on the cable-car line, within easy walking distance of Chinatown and the Ferry Building and if you don't mind walking a bit further, you can easily walk to the Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf areas from here. The hotel itself is lovely and the room was spacious, clean and comfortable. If I had to pick one thing to fault the room on, it would be the fixed-head shower. I didn't have a particular problem with it, but it was just ok - investing a little money in the shower would really bring it up to the standard of the rest of the accommodation. Staff at the Omni were very friendly and helpful, from check-in, where they offered to help us book any attractions we wanted to see, room service bending over backwards to make us happy when there was a slight problem with our order, the concierge recommending places to eat, right through to the doorman offering us the hotel car when we were leaving for the airport (at only $5 more than the taxi fare, this was a nice option). In addition, when we had an issue with the guests in the adjoining room holding an impromptu party late one night, hotel security dealt with it very quickly. We joined the Select Guest program online for free and this entitled us to complimentary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and juice every morning, as well as complimentary WiFi access and a daily newspaper. We ate breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant, which was somewhat expensive, but excellent quality and really tasty. There was complimentary fresh fruit (peaches, apricots, plums etc, not just standard apples) and juice or iced tea in the lobby every afternoon, which was nice when returning from sightseeing before going out to dinner. And the gym provided complimentary bottled water and apples and bananas too.

I was denied late check out and feeling a little green; I thought I would take my chances on an early check-in at the Omni. Having booked through Travelocity, my hopes were not high. I was greeted by the extremely efficient and professional Evelyn. She was kind, sympathetic and sincere. I was not a lesser human being for booking a discount room from an online service, hurray! I was feeling better. Evelyn clicked away on her keyboard and had me in a room within 10 minutes, my day was turning around. Enter Fernando, the very pleasant and chatty bellman that seemed to know everyone. He whisked my luggage away and we had a nice conversation. I arrived in the simple, yet elegant room to find a handwritten note from the housekeeper, Suyuak. I am a sucker for the personal touch. Slipping into a comfortable robe provided by the hotel, I decided to order room service, a Kobe burger would surely bring me around. The burger arrived and it was delicious! The meat was lightly spiced with a hint of pepper and the melted cheddar was just right! The fries were lightly spiced and delicious too. My high school reunion was 5 hours away and I was starting to feel human again. After a nice nap on the comfortable bed it was time to shower and head out for the evening. At the end of a long night, I decided to have a couple of classmates over to continue the reminiscing. I called over from the Sir Francis Drake where the reunion took place and asked room service to send a cart of refreshments up to my room. 30 minutes later when we all arrived, a beautiful cart with stemware, refreshments and snacks was waiting for us. Two thumbs up for Ms. Joanne, the goddess of In Room Dining that was running the floor solo and made this all happen. Mind you it was the manager the next day that told me Ms. Joanne had been alone, Ms. Joanne never complained or muttered a word. She made it all seem effortless. When it was time to turn in, I was so happy to have a minty treat on my pillow and turn down service. Most hotels in the four star genre have done away with this simple pleasure, it was a real treat to see my sheets folded down. When I walked up to the counter to check out the following day, I couldn't wait to shower the staff with praise. Crystal was checking me out and before she had the chance to ask, I blurted out \"I love this hotel!\" Crystal proceeded to check me out with the utmost efficiency and showered my with savings passes for Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and Macy's. What a smart move! Now I have to go back and book a room for a shopping weekend!

We needed quick transportation one evening in order to make our Alcatraz Tour, and the doorman provided two town cars for our party and we only had to tip the drivers. Because of its location, our 9th floor room overlooked the top of the Wells Fargo Bank and a Subway shop. There is a complimentary coffee maker in the room and a daily newspaper. We were very disappointed to be charged $10 a day for wireless internet access, since every other hotel we had stayed at in California provided this service for free. There is no parking. Valet parking service provided by the hotel is $48 a day plus tipping the driver! There is St. Mary's Parking Garage one block away with the awesome rate of $32 a day! The phone in the bathroom, lighted closet, and nightly turn-down service was nice.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201c20th Anniversary Stay was Terrific\u201d", "Author": "BCCajun", "ReviewID": "UR17413293", "Content": "I have stayed in many hotels all over the world. The Omni service was exceptional which is why this hotel is so highly rated. The \"premium\" class room on the top floor (17th) was large with the usual first-class amenities - king size bed, armoire holding the TV - mini-bar-drawers for clothing, a writing table and a chair. The room was very much like other major UPSCALE hotel chains but nothing palacial. The room was accurately described as having a \"partial view\" so I was not expecting more than this. I could see the bay but I also saw a lot of the side of the L-shaped Omni itself. The only hotel that I saw there that I would like to investigate next time was the Intercontinental Mark (somebody). It is a high rise on Nob Hill which is elevated already so I am sure the views were pretty spectacular. I am sure the price is as well. We had brunch at the Top of the Mark which is - you guessed it - on the top floor and we saw the view ourselves. Spectacular. But back to the Omni... When we told the concierge that this was our 20th Wedding Anniversary, they immediately arranged to have champagne and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room - complimentary. Having a bottle of champagne around just changes the whole mood of a hotel room - I highly recommend it. I am not suggesting that you lie about it being your anniversary, though. I had the 3-1/2 days in San Fran very well scheduled before we arrived because I wanted to make the most of our short stay, so I took the wind out of the concierge's sails when I showed him my calendar chart of restaurant reservations, Alcatraz cruise, Wok Wiz Chinatown tour, etc, but I would have missed the opportunity of eating at the Slanted Door if the concierge had not pointed out that they were in fact open for lunch (I had seen information indicating they only opened at 5 and could not work it into our evening time slots.) Tiger prawns, Vietnamese crepes, beef short ribs. WoW! One complaint: when you stay at the hotel that is rated #1, any little thing that is wrong will seem like a big deal. For instance, I had to take the coffee service tray out of the armoire and set it on the table and then I had to crawl under the table to reach the electrical outlet just to get it plugged in. I found myself getting quite indignant (silly pride) at the effort I had to personally exert just to hook up the thing. I have done this before in other hotels and not been nearly as bothered. Lesson: limit your expectations and you will always be more satisfied. Also: This is in the Financial District. While we never felt like we were out of the main part of town, it does get quiet on weekends. This was pleasant to us. You are still only a few blocks from Union Square, the Ferry Building, and Chinatown and you have cable cars running directly in front of the hotel. You will not feel isolated in the least.

Now the minor bad - which left a bad taste. The internet, which they charge for in standard rooms and even the business center, was out all three days. Each time we called, the front desk gave us a differnt explanation and a different timeframe for its solution. We wanted the internet to search for restaurants, events and attractions.

Just make sure you don't have too much luggage. The hotel is also within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown. There are also Muni lines and cable car lines very close by. HOTEL: I knew that it was an older hotel, but I guess I expected the rooms to be nicer. It is very clean, but there was no \"wow\" factor that I have seen at other hotels like Novotel Singapore or Venetian in Vegas. It was a regular room with regular t.v. with nice amenities but nothing ultra-modern. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms were very quiet, although you could hear some hallway noise, but nothing from outside the building. I guess that is why they are not considered a 5 star hotel. Minus one star for the room. SERVICE: The service was very good overall. Check in was quick and all the staff were extremely friendly. We are a select guest, so we get morning beverage service (you are supposed to get a card outside your room and you hang it out with your beverages). Since this is our first stay, we had no idea how this worked. We never got a card and got no beverages in the morning. When I called the front desk, they forwarded me to room service, and I got my beverages. I also told front desk that I didn't get a beverage card, just a room service, when they asked if I hung it outside. Well, for a #1 rated Tripadvisor and 4 star hotel, I would expect a select guest beverage card the following night, but no. So, minus one star for that. However, when I wanted coffee the next morning at 11:00 a.m. (they have a pot of coffee in Bob's every morning until 10:00 a.m.), the staff got me one, so add one star. Overall, this is a great hotel with great service. I can see why it is not 5 stars, but the service really makes it above the rest. HOTEL TIPS: Get free water and fruit in the fitness room. There is also free fruit in the afternoon and free lemonade in the lobby. There is free coffee in the morning at Bob's bar until 10:00 a.m. But, you get free beverage service delivered to your room if you sign up as a selected guest. RESTAURANT TIPS: We found two great restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Both are highly rated on yelp. The first is Bix. It is on Gold St., which is about 5 blocks north of Montgomery (10 minutes walk). It's in a small alley, and the food is awesome and moderately priced (entrees $25 to 35 range). Their appetizers are incredible, and the atmosphere is very nice. The second is Great Eastern in Chinatown for dim sum. This place is located on Jackson St. by Kearny. It is very clean compared to the other Chinatown places, and you order off of a menu with pictures (no carts). Service is a bit slow, but if you are looking for an adventure in Chinatown, definitely try dim sum there.

I reserved a Signature Room at the Omni San Francisco Hotel through Hotels.com for 4 nights, arriving August 31 and leaving September 4, 2007. When I arrived at the hotel I was informed that they had over-booked their rooms. I was told that I would be put in a lower cost standard room, a room without the Signature Room complimentary services. Needless to say, I was not happy about paying the Signature price for the lower cost room, this because I had paid in advance. When I complained, I was offered a free breakfast. After I refused to accept the room they had offered, I was finally given a Signature Room. No doubt some other poor schmuck got stuck paying top dollar for a standard room. A first-class hotel would never have suggested downgrading a paying customer, regardless of how or how much they paid. But then, Omni isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a first-class hotel. Once I had checked into my Signature accommodations, everything was fine except for one minor detail. On Monday morning, September 3, while entering the bathroom in my suite, I stepped on a carpet nail that was protruding upward out of the carpet in front of the bathroom door. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I needed to be concerned about walking barefoot in my own room, not in a first-class hotel. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as angry about being injured by Omni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negligence as I was by their response. When I contacted the front desk and explained that a nail had punctured my toe and that I was bleeding profusely, their staff offered me a band-aid. Given the fact that I was in pain and limping, given the fact that I now had to contact my doctor to find out when I last had a tetanus shot, given the fact that I now had to worry about catching some horrible disease from the last person who impaled themselves on their carpet nail - I would have expected a first-class hotel to be more consolatory than to offer me a band-aid. After I returned to my room, the Omni staff sent me a note stating that they were unable to find the nail that had injured me. They insisted that I point out the nail to their building engineer, which I did. As their building engineer was pounded the offending nail back into the floor, he stated that he discovered 2 more nails protruding upward out of the carpet in the same general area. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t aware that I was entering a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mine field\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when I checked into the Omni hotel.

I then asked what was the best way to get to the Oakland Airport. To add insult to injury, she suggested that I walk 4 blocks to the BART station. Once I returned home, I contacted the Omni management to complain. The hotel manager promised to send me a voucher for several free nights stay. This never happened.

It was sometimes very cosy - sometimes downright stressful - with the kids. Anyway, here are my accommodation reviews. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mention side trips and tours too. Sometimes the accommodation was arranged through a travel agent, but on a couple of occasions I organised it direct. The Omni was arranged through a travel agent in Brisbane, though as usual I had checked with Trip Advisor, and then asked the travel agent to book it when I was satisfied. He got me better rates than going to the hotel direct, too. We were also staying at an Omni in Boston, and as I'd joined the Omni's Select Guest program (free, via the internet), there were advantages to be had. Plus, we'd previously stayed at the Omni in Washington and it was spectacular (my favourite of the 3 Omnis I've stayed in whilst in the USA), so we thought it would be good. We weren't disappointed. Fairly large rooms (we had a double and a triple, though the kids weren't particularly happy at 2 of them having to share a double bed - but then, they're not paying!); interconnecting which was useful. Free internet (I had a laptop) for Select Guest members (if you stay at the Omni, the Select Guest program is recommended - free juice/coffee and newspaper delivered every morning). Very reasonably sized bathroom. In all, very comfortable. It's a grand building with an impressive foyer. We received a lovely sincere welcome from the bell captain on arriving. The hotel is not all the conveniently located, but we were happy to walk and find our way around. Finding cheap restaurants (try feeding 5, including 2 big boys, for 4 weeks straight - you won't be eating at the hotel restaurants very much!) was a bit of a task, but not impossible. Speaking of meals, we fell over Francis Ford Coppola's Italian cafe in Kearney Street on the way back from climbing the Coit tower - it was great. Google it if you are interested. I brought some of the wine back to Australia. We decided to eat there purely on the basis of the menu and the look of the place, then found out who the famous owner was. Recommended purely on the Italian food and the venue, if nothing else. We did a tour of the city (booked through the travel agent), which was absolutely worthwhile. Stopped at good views of the city (from a high lookout), and another spot for views of the Golden Gate Bridge (which the bus drove over). It also included a harbour cruise from Pier 39 at Fisherman's Wharf, which went under the Golden Gate Bridge and circled Alcatraz Island. It's a good way to see the highlights.

I had no idea what they were talking about and after further investigation, they told me there was a hole in the wall of the room we stayed in. I of course asked for the manager to call me, and was extremely taken aback at how I was treated. He was pompous and rude and immediately accused me of putting the hole in the wall. He assured me there was no way his staff would have missed the hole and rented out a room in such a state. I told him that they did, and that my friend (who I immediately phoned afterwards) actually saw the hole \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but forgot to mention it to me (it was at the bottom of the wall near the baseboard in the hallway near the door, making it easy to miss). After I relayed this to the manager, he made a snide remark about how guests of his hotel are high-class and would call and complain if they received a room with a hole in the wall. Having no idea of the consequences of not reporting the hole, my friend didn't feel he needed to say anything and thus I never knew about it. The manager was horribly condescending and from his last remark implied that I was not a high-class guest and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdidn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at his hotel. I again assured him that the hole was not from me and he had no proof. He again insisted that his staff does not make mistakes and would never rent out a room with a hole in the wall. I was not going to budge and insisted that he reverse the charge. After going back and forth for awhile, he finally succumbed and reversed the charge. However, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I should not have had to defend my honor, and I knew he thought I was lying even after he reversed the charge. Even though I got the charge reversed, I still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like I won. This hotel should not be four-star, as four-star hotels would never treat their guests like this. The Omni San Francisco is a third-rate hotel with mediocre customer service and horrible management.

I had notified the hotel that it was my husband's birthday, and they sent up a bottle of wine (which was pretty good), a fruit and cheese platter and a birthday card.

We ate at Bubba Gump's (just for the novelty of it) but the food was lousy and overpriced. * Fisherman's Wharf - nice to walk around, lots of souvenir shops and fresh seafood stands. * Giradelli Square - go for the sundaes, they are worth the $8! * Lombard St - worth the walk up this hill / crooked street * Tonga Room - just up the street (hill) from the hotel (at the Fairmont Hotel) we went for the $8 happy hour buffet, well worth a visit for an early dinner, and the atmosphere is pretty cool, especially when it \"rains.\" * AT & T park - saw a Giants game (bought tickets there), what a nice park, with beautiful views of the bay (if you get the right seats - we were on club level) * Ferry Building / Market - there was always some kind of street performance going on there.

That evening the room was turned down, chocolates were left and the television was tuned to a station that was entirely soothing music and beautiful scenes. Again, what an amazing touch.

I'd also advise you to sign up for the Omni Club prior to check-in, as membership has some nice freebies, like complimentary beverages and newspapers brought to your room each morning. Free wireless access, too. That said, the decor and furnishings at the Omni are nothing special, rather bland and corporate.

It is only 10 min walk from Ferry Building which has many cafes etc and markets at the weekend. Or just hop on cable car that goes past hotel and get off further up California Street to jump on cable car down to Union Square, 15 mins tops. Loads of places to eat there. The cable cars are great, get a $11 dollar all day ticket from hotal reception, valid for the cars and buses. Rooms are lovely, nice and big and great bathrooms, all marble, rooms have air con big TV , video games etc. We used as base to explore, Lombard street, G Gate bridge, Fishermans Wharf, Italian quarter, Coit Tower. Most is easily walkable but those hills can be pretty steep so the cable cars really do make it easy. One tip though.... it can be better to go the end of the line/terminus to get a car and join the queue as some are very busy and nobody gets off, hence you can wait at a stop and not get on at all. Busiest route is from the Market to Fishermansd Wharf via Hyde Street. This one passes over Lombard Street just by the 'crooked street' bit. Great fun standing on the side and leaning out.... which you are not supposed to do of course. We did have one evening meal in the Bob's Steakhouse, attached to hotel and one brealfast.

I like the fact the room service is prompt and the bed is very comfortable. Evening turn-down, personal notes and next day's forecast is thoughtful. As previous reviewers described, this hotel has NO view (I stayed at the Hilton FD last time, the views are GEORGIOUS, check my previous post for pictures). There are few types of the rooms and they do have different amenities in the room but the bathrobes are standard feature in every room and nice marble bathroom (except in the accessible rooms you get showers only). There are few restaurants nearby (Tadich Grill is a must go!) few blocks walk to the bart station. Its not that bad of the area at night to walk around with but however it is a very boring area if nightlife is what you are looking for. Chinatown is nearby but still a bit of walk. The parking situation is bad, you will need to get a parking package or else you are looking to pay $40ish/night for parking. The gym on the 3rd floor is very nicely eqipped as well but I really think that they should add a swim pool / jacuzzi in the hotel.

Don't be fooled by the candid pics above you probably won't get the room that shows a duvet (that isn't the room we got), this hotel still uses bedspreads -- very unsanitary (anytime you get a room with a bedspread throw it in the corner immediately) they're a haven for bacteria. Otherwise, the bed was clean and comfortable. The bath, amenities, and towels were adequate though not luxurious. This is not a 5 star hotel or comparative to the Four Seasons though it did remind me of a Ritz Carlton. Our first room smelled like smoke but we were relocated quickly, our bill was overcharged for a mini bar item but was corrected and our room service order was wrong but also was corrected after a call. Park at St. Mary's if you are staying on the weekend it 's 1/5 the price of the $45 parking rate and catty corner to the hotel. Plan on paying for parking, it is San Francisco. We probably would not do a car if we stayed in the city again, it's too hard with the steep slopes and we are used to driving a lot. The hotel was clean and the location is off the beaten path a bit although still relatively close to everything. The rooms were really clean and the young man at check in was nice and helpful.

Here are some other tips: We had a cheap great lunch at the mexican restaurant communal dining Mijita at the Ferry Building and parking was only $5 with validation, we enjoyed walking around the Ferry Building marketplace but skipped the touristy Fisherman's Wharf. We took the ferry to Sausalito and that was great.

WRONG. If you have a pair of legs and can walk you can be on Market St/Union Square in 5-10 minutes. I'm used to big busy cities and there is nothing worse than staying in the throbbing throng with all the tourists. For this reason the location of the Omni is a real bonus. Far from the madding crowd but no so far to be any kind of inconvenience. It is true that most of the guests seem to be there on business but its no problem. Dont eat there if you dont want to hear suits talk turkey. Go out and enjoy the many fanatsic restaurants in San Fran instead. TIPS: Join the SelectGuest programme (a kind of clubcard membership) for free in adavnce and then you get a free paper and drink delivered to your room every morning at a time you specify. You also get the option of ordering light breakfast items at an extremely reasonbale rate. (cream cheese toatsted bage was about $3 or \u00c2\u00a31.50). The gym is stocked with complimentary water and fresh(ish) fruit. 'Nuff said on that one! Free internet service in the lobby. If noise bothers you stay as high up as possible. (on the 5th you can hear the tram bells, on the 13th you can hear nothing). You can buy your MUNI passes from the fornt desk at their face value. If travelling without too much luggage do yourself a favour at SFO and use the BART rather than pay for a taxi. A jounrey on the BART is only $5.15 and the walk from Montgomery Station is less than 10 minutes. The BART was very safe and clean. ROOMS: Look nicer than they appear in the photos. They're quite dark which is why the photos dont do them justice. It's all very faux-Georgian but tastefully done. Bathrooms are classy too. Not enormous amounts of storage but enough. Avoid the mini-bar. SERVICE: Front-desk and doormen were superb. Extremely friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. Room service was extremely punctual with the selectguest drinks delivery. (you book a 15 minute slot and they there on the button every time). A Maitre D at Bobs steakhouse (attached to the Omni) was a bit stuffy but thats not their problem. Remember its mainly business people eating or using the bar there so I would avoid. LOCATION: You're in the business district but this does mean the area is well served by espresso bars, jamba juice and diners for workers. Also, a tram stops outide the hotel which is handy.

(St. Francis, the Palace, the Milano, Hyatts, Mariott, Sir Francis Drake, Kensington Park etc.) over the years and this was definately among the best. Many hotels will have nice lobbies, but have very ordinary rooms . The Omni had beautifully furnished luxurious rooms with every imaginable amenitiy. I would recommend it to anyone. As San Francisco is developing more and more to the east of Union Square, restaurants, shopping and attractions are near the Financial District location of the Omni. Plus, the California Cable Car line is right outside. We were in S.F. for the Chinese New Year Parade (a block away), Prom Dress Shopping, (5 min walk) and to attend an event at MoMA (10 minute walk). Nearby Belden Place offers some of San Franciscos best restaurants and a truly european bistro experience, that is entirely family friendly. We had dinner at Brindisi.

Having paid approximately $48 a night for parking at a hotel in the Union Square area, this seemed a great deal.

The large closet has a safe and bathrobes. The bathroom was large with a huge shower/tub with great water pressure. Large make-up mirror, too. As mentioned, Select Guest program will get you beverages and a newspaper, delivered at the time you designate. Some breakfast items offered to SGs at $2-4 such as bagels, muffins or breakfast burrito. Great prices! More extensive menu available through room service.

The steakhouse restaurant has very good food- a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches were on lunch menu. Prices a bit high but not out of line for SF restaurants. Staff very attentive.

I normally opt for affordablility over luxury, but sometimes you just want to be pampered and are willing to pay a little bit more. For those occasions, you can't go wrong with Omni. They understand the what a true luxury hotel experience is all about. At Omni, the customer is always right, and the customer's needs always come first. Case in point- my room key did not work upon check-in (they had given me a room that was still occupied, oops), and when I returned to the front desk, they upgraded me to a 2-room corner suite for my trouble, apologizing all the while. This was followed up with a personal note of apology from the front desk manager the next morning - and a fresh fruit basket in the afternoon, again gratis. The suite (room 920) was gorgeous, with a sitting room, 2 flat-screen TVs, and a DVD player. One of the nice things about staying in the Financial District is that it's very quiet at night - no sirens, ambulances, etc. I joined the Select Guest program several years ago. As others have noted, I highly recommended joining for the free perks. I enjoyed the complimentary beverages (choice of 2 - try the coffee and hot chocolate together!) and morning paper, and was pleasantly suprised to find that this Omni also offered Select Guests a range of reduced-price breakfast items along with the complimentary morning beverages. For $3.75 each, we ordered the breakfast burritos, which were hefty and delicious, served with fresh salsa. Imagine - a delicious room-service breakfast in SF for under $5!

(I'm not sure which, as we registered and made our booking at the last minute.) You can also buy these coupons on ebay, and they're fully transferable. (It says so on the coupon.) This might be very worth your while if you're staying for several days. If we had known about the Omni ahead of time, we would have planned ahead to get this. You also get free morning beverages in your room for all the people staying -- 2 beverages per person. We had 2 adults and our two children (ages 3 and 1) and got coffee for 4 and orange juice for 4 every morning, for example. You need to remember to put the little Select Guest hang tag, which they give you with your key, on your door ahead of time to receive this. You will also get a morning paper (you choose which paper), as well as a scone-like cookies and milk every evening with your turndown service. The room is fairly standard for a hotel room but quite comfortable. The bed linens are good quality, and the bathrooms are very roomy and marble. Everything is spotless. I was surprised the towels were not softer -- they're thin and not very comfortable, but they're serviceable and clean. We did request a room upgrade if they were available, and I was disappointed not to be upgraded for free (they said I could pay an extra $100 for a suite), but I certainly wasn't entitled to this so that's fine. That is the only disappointment of our Omni experience, and it is extremely minor. We had two small children with us, and the Omni is fantastic for families with children. The kids got a great goodie bag with crayons, activity books, playing cards, and even a small digital clock that they could hang from their coats or suitcases. My 3 year old was delighted with the bag, and she can be a tough customer! You can also request a \"Kids' Suitcase\" from the front desk, and this is literally a small rolling suitcase full of things like an Etch a Sketch, electronic games device, card games like Go Fish and Old Maid, and several classic books (Goodnight Moon, some kids' chapter books). We had a babysitter coming in one night (not associated with the hotel) and found this suitcase extremely handy for the night we were away from the kids. You also are given free kids' straw cups that you can take down to the restaurant to have filled for free. We filled up with milk for the kids every morning and night, and they were fast and gracious about it even though we weren't staying for dinner or breakfast or anything. All the service people were wonderful (with the exception of one woman who was just a bit brusque working the front desk at night. She wasn't rude though, just minimally helpful). The doormen were great. Bell service was instantaneous when we called for it. I had to ask for housekeeping to clean up a spill once, and they came to the room within minutes. The doormen refused our tips. Oh -- and I was wary because I had read that the parking fee was $45 a day. When we pulled up, the valets asked us whether we preferred the $45 hotel parking or wanted to park ourselves at the garage a half-block away, for $7. There was no pressure at all, and they were not at all condescending. You can park at St Mary's Garage at the intersection of California and Kearny for $7 per in/out on holidays and weekends. It's very convenient, and the hotel told us about it themselves.", "Date": "September 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cI love this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "sista_mills", "ReviewID": "UR5769664", "Content": "Just got back from a stay at the Omni.

Positives: Location right on California Street provides a short trolley ride up to Chinatown. Actually, you can walk to just about anywhere in SF, so ride the $5 trolley only if you have to. The room was great, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The bathroom was huge (upgraded room), and they had free high-speed internet. Negatives: The staff was a bit pretentious. I work in IT and at the time I didn't have to wear a suit and tie like most of the business travellers there. The bellmen would open the door for anyone walking up, but they would just look me up and down like I didn't belong. I learned to take the side entrance on Montgomery so I could skip that whole uncomfortable feeling. The onsite steakhouse is average at best. The glazed carrot that they serve with every steak oozed it's glazing onto my steak. Not the best taste combo. For weekend travel you might find a better place to stay. The Omni is in the Financial District, so a lot of stuff is closed during the weekend.

The bathroom was nice with great soaps and things. The room also came with robes, a safe and umbrella.

I have been in many hotels in San Francisco before but never at the Omni. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve heard great things about it from my colleagues and have read consistent, good reviews on the web. I decided to give a try for our family vacation, considering someone in the family is usually picky about hotels. The room was very clean and well equipped with everything, including bathrobes. The marble bathtub was sparkling and the bed was very comfy. The entire staff was very nice. The room was serviced twice a day, and a complimentary beverage was delivered in the morning - with our choice of beverages and delivery time. There were two computers in a small room at the hotel lobby for guests to use the Internet though the guest rooms also have free high-speed Internet. Overall, I had better experience at the Omni than I had in other 5 or 4-star hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in SF, thanks to its personalized service. All the good things you read from the reviews are true. Besides service, another reason we picked the Omni is its location. It is in the middle of everything and right on the cable car line. It is two blocks from Chinatown \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very convenient for getting fresh Chinese pastries in the mornings. A few advices if you decide to stay at the Omni: (1) Sign up for the Select Guest program before you make the reservation. You can read the benefits on omnihotels.com. (2) Take public transportation (BART/MUNI) instead of renting a car. If you have to rent a car, rent it in the city and try to return on the same day, since overnight parking can be pricy. I like the MUNI Passport (for 1, 3 or 7 days), it is convenient if you ride cable cars a lot (we had to do that to make our 3-yr-old happy). (3) The hotel is big on great guest services, not on impressive architecture (like the Atrium of the Hyatt Regency) or in-house amenities/activities (such as a swimming pool) which is not a problem since it is close to many attractions anyway.

Cable car does stop outside but we did not really try to catch as preferred to walk each day. Having tried to stay at the Argonaut down at Fisherman Wharf (fully booked and on seeing the hotel during our visit) I am really glad we chose to stay at the Omni. The hotel is extremely comfortable and offers a quiet and distinctly elegant stay. Whilst in San Fran we had an excellent meal in China Town at the Empress of China (recommended by the front desk) and also at the Stinking Rose (Garlic Restuarant) which I think was in Little Italy. Also breakfast at Mamas was well worth the queue outside. One tip is if you want to go to Alcratraz book on line prior to arriving in San Fran as this was totally booked up when we arrived which meant we could not go on the trip. Also had a fabulous tour with Mr Toad's tours in a 1920's wooden open bus and the trip over by Ferry to Solsalido was fab.", "Date": "September 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMost enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3833233", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the hotel for four nights in early August, having made the booking based on the recommendations of this site.

So, i want to return the favor and put in my 2 cents since i was able to save a lot of $$$. First off, if you want to do a weekend getaway... I would suggest Sat, Sun and check out Mon..instead of Fri-Sun... the biggest money drain is the parking...$45/night...if you park at St. Mary's parking...it is $30/nite..M-F...but only $6.50 during weekends! So...by going on Sat, Sun..you save quite a bit. Ok..the good: Very nice, clean, and classy hotel...service and attitude were top notch...doormen were friendly and eager to help... ladies on the desk were knowledgable and efficient. The room is average size, but the bathroom was very classy. No motel quality here...the shower is tiled natural stone...(marble or granite)...sink was nice granite, and huge framed vanity mirror...fancy shower curtains and nice tiled floor. I hate cheap crappy plastic bathrooms... The bed was a double queen...it was pretty good as well...ive slept in better beds but this will do. Overall the room was very clean and well appointed. Signing up for the Omni select guest is worth it...you should do it well in advance so you get the additional coupons for upgrades and discounts. You must do this in advance to activate them... Location wise...it is very ideal...next to chinatown 2 blocks, 4 blocks to Union square and 4 blocks to Embarcadero center and 3 blocks to columbus ave bars.. china town is up the hill but if you can make it to st. mary's parking lot...you can make it to chinatown. Honestly though, I think getting a hotel by fishermans wharf wouldve been a better location...but then, you'd get a Motel quality place for a Hotel price tag... i chose the hotel...If you have a baby or kids... fisherman's wharf would be a better fit. But if you like bars..i think Omni would be great since Columbus ave bars is just next door...very cool place. Awesome chinese food (dimsum also) at Harbor village in the embarcadero. (order the nobleman's chicken $80..a day in advance. Its called Beggar's chicken in Hong Kong...absolutely amazing) RG lounge is also good chinese food that's walking distance... peking duck is good...but Harbor village takes all the awards. If you like steaks...and not afraid to drop $50+...Bob's chop house is awesome. I loooove steak... breakfasts/lunch is more reasonable.... but they have all the best cuts at night. Defintely worth going to. The BAD.. No swimming pool or spa... after walking up hills and blocks of concrete pavement... you'd want a spa to relax in. None. Bummer for kids. Hotel was sold out...so my select guest coupons and discounts were useless for upgrades...so call in advance. Parking is highway robbery.. they should have discounts for guests.. Overall... it is still a good experience. its no resort...its a business hotel, and maybe not a good pick if you have kids...but if you want a good place to sleep with your wife or girlfriend...close by to bars and great food. And without all the other complaints of moldy bathrooms, smelly beds, and crappy A/C... a nice respectable hotel like this is worth it.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cPefect!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3799764", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Omni on Aug 12-14. We were starting a ten day tour of the California coast and celebrating our five year anniversary. Our stay at the Omni was a perfect way to start this very special vacation! I had researched several B&Bs and hotels through Trip Advisor and decided on the Omni. We got our room for $135 for night one and $140 for night two - woo hoo! I had concerns of hearing outside noise in our room, the location being far away from things we'd want to see (we had never been to San Francisco), and the price of the mini bar. Here is what we found: We never heard any outside noise in our room. I am a very light sleeper, and no outside noise could be heard. The location was excellent! We could get to the Wharf in 20 minutes walking. The front desk will tell you how to avoid the hills. We only rode the cable cars once to say that we did it. We also rode the bus once to Haight Ashbury (Golden Gate Park) which was a very interesting trip. Our favorite section was the Italian District, lots of great places to eat and cool little bars! A very easy walk to/from the Omni. Don't hesitate to ask the front desk how to get places. They are very helpful! The Omni is located in the Financial District, so on the weekends the sidewalks aren't crowded. Finally, we never even opened the mini bar because of some of the reviews that we had read. There is a Trader Joe's close by where we purchased some wine and snacks. From reading a past review I joined (free) the Select Guest Program. This is a must! Just go to --- and fill out a quick form. We signed up just days before our trip. Because I signed up late, I emailed the Omni our guest number just to make sure that they had it on file. This is an unbelievable program - for free! All of our requests were granted! You'll have to go to the site to check this program out...and sign up!

Our biggest regret is that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t extend our weekend another day for more time here! From the time we arrived, the service was very personable and great. Check in took less than two minutes and upon arriving in our room, found a welcome note on the bed. The hotel was clean and even the smallest request was granted without asking. One example was when going out for our anniversary dinner, it was obvious we were dressed up for a special occasion. Instead of hailing us a cab as requested, he had a town car brought over to take us to dinner, complimentary. A very nice touch! My two recommendations to anyone staying here would be to sign up for \"Select Guest\" so at the very least you will bet a free juice and paper in the AM (and a big discount on a bagel/muffin). The other would be to verify your room size at check in. Traditionally, we have found corner rooms at the Omni to be of larger size so we try and request those. Here, it was an odd configuration (and a bit smaller) with part of a wall impeding the entry. Not a big deal since we probably only spent 4-5 hours in our room outside of sleeping but thought I would pass that along if. If you want a snack, there is a Subway across the street, a Mrs. Fields on the next block and a convenience store just around the corner. We bought drinks there and put them in the ice bucket; ready to drink when we got back from the day. They even added fresh ice when both when cleaning the room and at turndown. Location couldn't be better as we walked to Pier 39, Union Square and a very small hill (more of a grade) up to Grant Street and Chinatown. The bar was perfect for what we were looking for at the end of a long day, not a major party scene and not completely empty. We could carry on a conversation, hear the cable car as it went by and just enjoy the evening. Service was quick and the drinks were actually priced good for a hotel bar. Once again, very friendly and accommodating. I'll also have to second the Italian restaurant that the concierge recommended as it was perfect for a not too expensive dinner and was a walk of only 2-3 minutes.

An even nicer touch was when we arrived in the room and found a bottle of wine, some chocolates, and a nice letter of welcome from the Select Guest manager. We were sold! Room was great. Excellent corner location. Bathrooms were amply supplied with towels and well-lit. There was a sound system and DVD in-room as well. Valet was ultra efficient in retrieving our car within 15 mins.

The doormen, desk staff, housekeepers, all wonderful.

Housekeeping did a fine job maintaining the room, but neglected to ensure a second roll of toilet paper was available. The mints offered during the evening turndown service were a nice touch. The hotel is more of a business hotel than resort property...no pools, spas, activity rooms, or even a small gift shop to be found. The business center did offer computers with complimentary high speed internet access, and the health club offered a variety of workout machines. Located midway between the Wharf and Union Square, and on the California street cable car line, the S.F. Omni is nicely located in the center of the financial district...seemingly hundreds of ATM's within a couple of blocks. Most attractions are easily within walking distance...but beware the hills, they can be a full blown cardio workout.

Doorman was fantastic, and front desk staff were amazing. Its in the financial district, so that night there was hardly any street traffic.

This is a smaller hotel than the big monsters like the St.Francis, so there is not a gift shop, but a Bob's Steak and Chop House Restaurant. We were familiar with Bob's from Texas, but never ate there. We had planned to move the next day to the Monaco to be closer to Union Square, and noticed an immediate drop in service level. The rooms at the Omni are average size, and have a nice marble bathroom. They could use a separate shower. The room we had on the top floor, had a fruit basket and fax machine. Upon checkout, we were teased about leaving after just one night, and asked if they had done anything wrong. We replied Omni Service was great. During our stay in San Francisco, we went to the Ferry Market on Tue when they have local farmers kiosks set up. We also took a tour of the city with Great Pacific, a local small very nice tour company. Also drove one day over to Sausalito. Dined at Scoma's on the Wharf, Tadich Grill, Sam's Grill, and the Cheesecake Factory on Union Square. For lunch, there is a very busy In N Out Burger on the Wharf. Very good meals at all of them.
