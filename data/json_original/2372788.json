The staff kept the bags for us and he was nice for showing us the places around. But such good impression vanished after we returned to the hotel for check-in at around 4pm. 3 staff were working at the reception and some hotel guests were waiting for their help but the 2 female staff there were talking very rude to the male staff in Italian. I've no idea on what there were talking about but obviously such situation wasn't look good to the guests. When my turn for checking-in came, i tried to request for a twin room but a lady strictly told me that \"No, your booking shown that it's a double bed room\". Come on, i booked the room by email the hotel directly in the last minute before i got on the plane, i understand that it's my prblem but y couldn't she answer me in a much gentle way? we were so happy when stepping in the room as the decoration & design are great as well as the lighting effect impressed us so much. shower area is nice but the cleaningless of the room was so-so. The shower gel was found used n a golden hair was obvisouly saw sticking on it. some gel has been consumed so we really wonder the staff checked the bathroom amenities or not. we then put this bottle on the water tap n wish they could change it on the other day but finally, no. it was keeping until the time we check-out. Another thing disappointed me is the Wifi facility. We were told that Wifi available in hotel Selena breakfast room but it never works in our entire stay. Signel can be found but connection was unsucessful. we explained to the reception female staff n she told me that it's our phone problem. -_-\" i'm using the Nokia window phone n she told me that iPhone did work so my friend immediately took her iPhone4 out n stated that it doesn't work as well. She's working in IT dept n understand that it's router setting problem bla bla bla but again, the staff said other hotel guests have no problem and we were the only 2 who raise such issues. In that case, we asked 4 other hotel guests on next day morning breakfast time but none of them were able to use the Wifi, actually we haven't see anyone using smart phone there...we were suggested to bring our own laptop for cable connection at last. As a frequent leisure traveller, i could say that i'd better try another hotel for my next stay in Rome.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cHotel Dharma (Hotel Selene Affiliate)\u201d", "Author": "Focused77", "ReviewID": "UR121534977", "Content": "We had the pleasure of staying 4 nights in a suite at Dharma in November.
