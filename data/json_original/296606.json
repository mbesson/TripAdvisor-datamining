After reading some of the other reviews I was a little apprehensive about staying here, but oh how I was wrong... this hotel is PERFECT for anyone (young or old) wanting to experience Amsterdam for all the right reasons (weed, red lights, tours etc). Cleanliness: The hotel was very clean and neat at all times. Room is cleaned/made by the staff daily and fresh towels etc are placed in the room each day. Location: Probably the best part of this hotel is its location, it is 3min walk from the train station and about 5min walk from the busiest red-light district yet the street (warmoesstraat) is not at all seedy and is in fact one of the hubs for coffeeshops/bars/suvinours/food etc. Rooms: Clean, neat, and perfect for a short stay. Service: Excellent, the staff were very helpful and friendly at all times. Value: We asked around at a few other hotels in the area (most of which looked dodgy in comparison) and were shocked to find that most of the \"dodgy\" ones wanted more than we were paying at the Luxer and were in lesser positions on the \"to be\" map. Sleep Quality: You're going to Amsterdam and want to sleep? I think you should try another location, Amsterdam is a party city and not for people wanting to wine and dine and sleep. Having said that however, the windows in the hotel do provide a good bit of sound insulation to the outside noise (which will generally go on into the wee hours of the morning, regardless of the day-of-week). Safety: This hotel is very safe and the staff very very trust worthy, we often (in a stoned state of mind) would leave wallets laying around our room and go out to walk the streets and not once did a single penny go missing (even tho staff had clearly been in the room to clean). Internet: Those of you who need to use the internet, the hotel has a PC connected to the net near reception and if its not busy they will generally let you use it for free, otherwise a mere 1 euro for 5min. Food/Drink: The bar/recepetion is also open 24 hours a day and very reasonably priced, they serve snacks too, such as toasties etc. Travel: There is a side alley for safe storage of any bicycles, of which I HIGHLY recommend you hire for the duration of your stay, its the best way to get around and see all of Amsterdam at your own pace and with little physical strain... the walking will kill you eventually otherwise... you have been warned! Coffeeshops: Recommendations... in the same street there are several coffeeshops, I personally liked Hunters (which is a relaxing place with marine aquariums to watch while enjoying your weed). There is also Baba's coffeeshop in the same street, however they music is generally too loud to enjoy when stoned. Greenhouse effect is also in the same street and sells good weed but is a little cramped and music wasnt great. Now for the gem... round the corner is a cafe/bar called Green Light District... they have awesome decor and great varied music (at a nice volume level), they do not sell weed but you are more than welcome to buy your weed elsewhere and smoke it there (be sure to at least buy a coke or coffee). Costs: There are plenty options for those on a budget and those who can afford to dine in the many restaurants. On average you should budget about 12 euro for a decent meal (pizza/pasta/steak/ribs etc) or you can get McDonalds/BurgerKing/similar for around 5-6 euro incl. a drink. Weed will cost you about 10-12 euro per \"gram\" which will made about 3 joints. Beer etc costs around 4 euro per drink and cool drinks are about 2.50 euro.

Further information said that the room was \"located on walking distance of the hotel.\" So, I booked it. When we arrived to check-in, we were led about a block down the street to a narrow alley, and then to a plain, non-descript door in an area that had the faint odor of urine. Upon opening it, we were led up a poorly lit stairway to the second floor, then down an equally dim corridor to our room. The room itself was clean, but there was a flimsy lock on the door and a hole in the bathroom door. The floor of the free-standing closet was broken in half, and there was a hole in back wall of the closet. There also were neither clothes hangers nor chairs in the room. The room lighting, as is the case in most European hotels of this level, was barely adequate. At night it was noisy since our room overlooked the alley and was located near a loud bar. A couple of hours after we went to bed, we heard voices and footsteps approaching our room door, and then somebody fumbling with a key to open the door. We had to yell a couple of times that we were in the room to stop them from opening the door. We then realized from the conversation on the other side that it was an employee trying to show a prospective customer our room. I guess he did not realize it was already occupied. That was another thing wrong with the room...no inside lock on the door.

The RLD is mostly pedestrianised apart from bikes and service vehicles. The hotel itself is in the midst of the RLD where we had booked to be. Soooo we checked in and the credit card was swiped and everything seemed good and we held out our eager, tired hands for our keycard, only to be told that there was a problem with our room and we were to be given alternative accomodation elsewhere. \"only 5 minutes away\". Eventually someone came 30minutes later and led us on a 20 minute trail to a dodgy looking bedsit which I`m not sure even had windows, only to be then told if we wanted breakfast we would need to go back to the hotel! To cut a long story short, we stomped backed to the Luxer where the receptionist grudgingly gave us the key to another room in the hotel but said it was for people yet to book in. We weren`t pleased but were tired so acccepted, but apparently she gave us an incorrect key for an occupied room. Eventually we recieved the correct keycard for an empty room. The room was very basic and could do with a few lessons from budget hotels who know what they are doing. This is not three star as most people would know it. Try 1 or 2 star at 4 or 5 star prices. Forget a view, but we did have fun re-naming the tv channels. Next day whilst indulging in a siesta, the intended occupants (we assume) entered our room. Thankfully, they had the sense to about turn and leave! All through or stay we were making trips up and down to reception to have our key re-activated. Very annoying. Important Stuff. The rooms were clean enough. The cleaner was an English man and the toilets were spotless and the towels changed daily. The air con was rubbish. I wasn`t particularly impressed by the buffet breakfast. Although the fruit, when there was fruit, was welcome. Amsterdam is VERY VERY VERYexpensive, especially for drink and very very seedy. We were constantly being asked by various individuals if we were looking for Charlie. In the RLD, there are mainly 4 kinds of shop - coffee, pub, restaurant and sex stuff. 3 days were enough. I`d like to go back to Amsterdam one day and do the museums. But I won`t be booking this hotel again. Especially when there are familiar chain hotels nearby such as the Ibis which is right next to the train station. Book really early.

Now I have quite high expectations from hotels not really going below 4 star accommodation so you can imagine how I felt to walk into a cold dark room to find that there were no doors on the cupboard, the hanger rail had been broken off, cigarette ash on the floor along with a crisp packet under the bed, stained bedding and a view of empty bottle crates.

While i dont agree with it being a 1 star, it is a very high 2 star or average 3 star. We got a very good deal of \u00c2\u00a3120 for two people for 2 nights, including breakfast and city tax, which considering its location is very good. Location is right in the heart of the city, red light district is around the corner, good range of places to eat a stones throw away, as are cafes. It can get very busy outside and if you get a room over looking the street it can get noisy, but we had asked for a room at the rear and got it, which made a huge difference. The rooms are well laid out, nothing grand, but clean and comfortable, the bathroom we had was great, continetal style, walk in shower with endless amounts of hot water, and i mean hot, with a shower that if put on full blast will knock you over( ideal after a cold wander around the city) Breakfast is served until 11am, which suits us, no need to fall out of bed early !! Breakfast is as you would find in any other hotel, cheese, smoked meats, boiled eggs, selection of bread and rolls, jams etc, all very nice, very fresh. The coffee is great, just what is needed to wake you up. It has been mentioned in other reviews aboutthe size of the breakfast area, yes it is a little cramped, but no worse than other hotels, and if the breakfast area is full then you can use the tables up around the bar. If anything it is better up there as you can watch the world go past as you eat breakfast. The doors of the hotel are locked, this is to keep out the riff raff, and should by no means put you off, just press the buzzer and door is buzzed open, but to be honest we never had to buzz as there is always some one at reception.

I have been to Amsterdam three times before (all in 2005) and love the city and new the area. It is blocks from Dam square and a five minute walk from Central Station. It is about a block away from the red-light district but not in the middle of it and not a bad location at all, I wouldn't want to stay in the middle of the red-light district. It is close to all kinds of restaurants and bars (and coffee shops of course if that's your thing... though it's not mine). The lady at the reception when I checked in was very friendly and check in was very quick. I learned, which I would have prefered to know ahead of time, that they charge 5 Euro more if paying by credit card, fortunately I had enough cash on me. This could be the fault of the site I booked with though, so I won't count it against the hotel. I do prefer to pay hotels wtih a card when possible in case of problems after I return home but do think 5 Euro is a bit much. I had requested a non-smoking single room not facing the street when I booked and got a smoking room with two twin beds which did not face the street. The smell of smoke wasn't that bad so I decided not to ask for a new room, plus I was only there for one night and I wasn't going to be back in the room until late after a night out so it wasn't a big deal. The room and the bathroom themselves were clean, except for the carpet which really needs to be replaced, it is stained probably from so much use. There were scuff marks on some of the walls so it could probably have used a paint job as well. Other than that the room was fine and most importantly like I said it was clean (except for the carpet). The beds were very comfortable and so were the pillows. The satellite TV did have a few English channels wihch was nice as my hotel in Prague did not. Again, I wasn't there to watch TV but it's nice to have a channel or two you understand when getting dressed, etc. I had heard about the bells from the old church in the area so I brought ear plugs and it wasn't an issue when I slept. Be sure to have them though because the bells do ring and might keep you up, of course by the time I got to bed I was exhausted anyway. Didn't have time for breakfast in the morning so can't comment on that. One thing that I didn't appreciate much was the cleaning lady in the morning coming around at 10:15 knockin on everyone's door who was checking out that day to let everyone know check out was at 11:00. I hadn't planned on waking up for another 15 minutes but oh well. Overall, though it was a short stay I would stay here again, but next time I would probably ask for a non-smoking room I had requested.

Until the heat in our room went out. For 3 nights. Burr. The problem wasn't necessarily the lack of heat (though yes, it was cold) or even my and my wife's resulting sore throats and runny noses. It was that with the exception of one employee, no one at the hotel cared. At all. No apologies. No \"can we offer you another room, or at least some extra blankets?\" No \"we're working to fix it.\" Nothing. Now, I say no one cared with one exception. Not sure it's cool to mention names, but \"J\" was awesome. Extremely helpful, and easily the nicest person we met on our entire trip. They should hire a half dozen more like him. Anyway, I hate it when people use these reviews to whine about service. So I'm not gonna list every little complaint in detail. Frankly, we probably would have overlooked or forgotten most of the bad service and attitude, had there not been such complete apathy when a real problem (the heat) arose. Honestly, you'll probably stay here and love it. If you're just looking for a place to crash between tourist stops and bars, it doesn't get much better. For us, the little things just added up in the face of a problem. When we checked out after 4 nights, the lady announced that our only additional charges were 2 Euro for the phone. After refusing to add it to my credit card because she \"would prefer to have the Euros,\" she handed me a small contact card for the Luxer, almost as an afterthought. \"Please remember us next time,\" she said. I will, lady.", "Date": "April 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but in the red light district\u201d", "Author": "travellers_from_oz", "ReviewID": "UR4950411", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Luxer for 3 nights in February. We paid 70 euro/night and for that price, the hotel was very good. We chose it because it would allow us to walk to all the places we wanted to see, but it ended up being right in the middle of the red light district, so we were constantly surrounded by post-teen tourists crowding the coffeeshops, and drug pushers. Not so good aspects: *It would be really great if I could walk down the street to the hotel at the end of the day without being offered heroin or cocaine multiple times. It really gets annoying and kind of ruins the great atmosphere that exists everywhere else in the city. *The reception at the hotel is also the bar, so it is always really smoky *Our room stank of smoke when we first got there despite booking a non-smoking room. It took a couple of days of open windows to get rid of the smell. *There is a lack of decent food nearby, most of it is levelled at people coming out of coffeeshops, we had to go pretty far to find a fresh meal. Positives: *I actually found the staff to be really helpful, they were fairly pleasant. *Rooms are a good size- lots of floorspace for luggage, table and chairs, comfy beds. The bathrooms are not big, but are very good and the shower is very good. TV has a good range of channels. *Great breakfast- breads, cereals, juices, coffee machine, cake, pastries, fruit, cold meats. Good variety and a good start to the day. *We were able to walk everywhere from there- Anne Frank house, museums, canal tours, Heineken Experience, and the train station is about a two minute walk away. *Internet and a laundromat are both on the same street, a couple of doors down and across the street. So overall, it wasn't so much the hotel that was a problem, just the area it's in. If you are planning to visit coffeeshops the whole time it would be perfect, if you want to see some sights you can walk everywhere from here, but be aware you will be in a dodgy area. Not so much unsafe, just dodgy. As for the hotel itself, it's excellent value if you pay a lower rate as we did- if it were in a different area, I would definitely consider staying there again. I would still recommend this hotel, mainly to student and/or budget travellers.", "Date": "April 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dulbin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA Good Base Camp\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4600048", "Content": "I've just got back from Amsterdam for a short break - and spent 3 nights at the Luxer.

Warmoesstraat itself is quite a pleasant street with a few bars, coffeeshops and restaurants as well as the shops that I mentioned earlier. One street across is the start of the RLD but during the day this is still a pleasant area for a quiet drink and some v. interesting people-watching!! Amstelkring (Our Lord in the Attic museum) is just around the corner and well worth a visit; no-one could imagine what lies behind a fairly uninspiring facade. The hotel is easy to find despite not having much in the way of frontage; it's a typically narrow building with quite a dark reception area - lots of red paint and dark wood. There's a little bar area (more expensive than surrounding bars and little in the way of atmosphere but pleasant enough for a drink before or after a night out) and the reception staff are helpful and informative. Check in was a very speedy process even though we arrived before our check in time of 2pm. Our rooms were on the 3rd floor at the back of the building so no view but also no street noise. Rooms were clean and fairly well-maintained; not particularly spacious but contained everything we required for our short stay (no tea/coffee making facilities however we brought our own supplies incl. cups and the chambermaid was kind enough to bring us a kettle which bizarrely had a UK 3-prong plug). Breakfast and city tax were included in the room price (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac90 per night for a double and \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150 per night for a triple); this certainly wasn't the case with most of the hotels that I looked at. Breakfast was a typically continental affair with cooked ham, turkey, cheese, cucumber, tomato, lots of freshly-baked bread, fruit, cereal, juice, tea/coffee etc. The breakfast area is a little cramped and very dark and tables had to be cleared by one member of staff (there was no option for guests to clear their own tables as dishes had to be taken directly into the kitchen) so sometimes this area was a bit messy. Overall, we had a lovely stay and I'd be happy to book this hotel for future visits.", "Date": "April 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorrible hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3357362", "Content": "First of all, the hotel is located on the noisy street in the gay district.

On departure we had to leave at 6:30am for an early flight to London, but Chris, the night receptionist, insisted on getting the breakfast buffet ready an hour early so that we could have yet another excellent breakfast before walking over to Centraal Station (less than 5 minutes - great location).

Walking around the area of the hotel felt safe at all times of the day or night (although walking down towards Dam Square - only a 5 minute walk - you do come accross the \"Charlie\" boys as in most parts of central Amsterdam - just say no!) We walked to all major attractions from the hotel: Boat Tours (at the station) 5 mins, Dam Sq 10 mins, Anne Frank House 15 mins, Heineken Experience 25 mins, Van Gough 35 mins. The hotel itself is decorated well, was clean and tidy and had helpful, polite staff. Our room was a twin room downstairs to the rear of the building. The room was much smaller than the pictures on the hotel website but was still comfortable with a clean bathroom (with shower only). A 21\" TV on the wall had a number of channels including BBC News, BBC World and various other UK channels as well as the local channels. The only downside to the room was the lack of natural day light as the room looked out in to a side yard (not throughfare). On our visit, there seemed to be a problem with our air conditioning unit which seemed to make loud noises every so often all night - even when switched off. As we were only there 2 nights we didnt worry about it. Breakfast is served to the rear of the building between the bar area and the lower ground bedrooms. The breakfast area is comfortable and serves Tea, Coffee, Hot Chocolate, Milk, Chocolate Milk & Orange Juice with Ham, Turkey, Cheese, tomato, hard boiled egg & Breads as well as cereal, muesli and sweet cake slices. All in all, good value for money (about \u00c2\u00a350 per night twin room inc Buffet Breakfast), very central close to numerous bars, restuarants, cafes, coffee houses & coffieshops as well as the lively Red Light District, easy walking/wondering to the main attractions or a short tram ride and best of all just a short walk from the station!

When we thought our electricity was off in the room, their handy man \"Harry\" came up and explained to us that we needed to use our door card inside the room to \"activate\" the electricity.
