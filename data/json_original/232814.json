It's very close to many exciting attractions (all within short walks), it's just steps from the Metro, and there are a ton of food options in the area. It's only a few feet away from Gran Via. I wasn't worried about the location at all as there are plenty of people in the area, and a lot of other tourists. Now a few not-so-positives: Others have mentioned that the beds are 'rock hard'. They really are. They were not very comfortable and took some time to get used to before I could actually get some sleep. The building is old and in need of some renovations. It is a \"4-star\" yet does not seem to have the \"4-star\" quality typical of 2012. And the negative: When we checked out, we were told that we had not prepaid for the room and needed to pay for the two nights we stayed. I showed the clerk my print out confirmation that showed I had prepaid, but he insisted that we still owed. Then the supervisor/manager/accounting person (I'm not sure of her title) came out - she stated that the rate was not prepaid and that we owed the hotel. I showed her my confirmation and she said that it was still showing on their records that it wasn't paid. Finally, they showed me printed confirmation of the booking at their end - and the name was not ours. In fact, the room number was not even close to our room number. I was quite unimpressed with this. I felt that the front desk person did not verify our hotel room number when we told him, and he just went off my last name (which he misheard). The supervisor/manager/accounting person was defensive and accusatory right off the start. She didn't ask any qualifying questions to ensure that the booking she was looking at was ours. She just assumed it was, which is not of 4-star customer service in my opinion. Had she done things right, she would have said \"Let me just verify your room number and name\"...especially since I had given BOTH of them my confirmation print out with my full name on it. So, had I not experienced what I considered to be a rude interaction with staff, I would have suggested have given this hotel an \"average\" rating. Having dealt with this situation, though, and compared to the other 7 hotels we stayed in during our Europe trip, I have to say \"poor\" for this hotel.

A much nicer room (both of them seemed to have been renovated fairly recently) and, just when we thought that we could finally get some sleep, a loud drone started as the hotel's Air-Conditioning plant kicked into action in the early morning.

When I did finally get on line, I was constantly loosing my wifi signal, sometimes the search for wifi turned up no signals whatsoever and then other times there was a telefonica signal which was a completely different server (requiring it's own fee!) The TV remote worked about as often as the internet, after buying the extra movie channels for 11 Euro, the channel would switch off about every 5 minutes. Calls to the front desk were not helpful and met with the same indifferent attitude as check-in. Laundry was unbelievably expensive and thankfully closed on the weekend (Traveling with two young children I was almost desperate enough to pay) of course the front desk offered no help to finding the locations of nearby wash-a-terias. (There was one on Calle del Cruz near Del Sol) Parking was right across the street but expensive at 25 Euro a day, and no validations from hotel either. Not that it's not done in Spain because NH Viapol validated my parking in Sevilla. Breakfast was lame, not a big selection, especially if you arrived after 9:30 where most of all the fresh fruit and sliced hamon was already gone.

The service in the hotel was also poor, for example, when I asked if they could call me a taxi, they referred me to the street to call one for myself. The breakfast was fine, but the breakfast room reminded me of faulty towers in terms of its decor. Overall, I feel that the hotel's 4 star rating, and the prices they charge are scandellous, given the quality of accomodation and service offered.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cAvoid this hotel at all costs....\u201d", "Author": "LaSangria", "ReviewID": "UR5558119", "Content": "Having travelled extensively through Spain several times, I found this to be the worst hotel in the entire country. SERVICE - Extremely poor. I speak Spanish fairly well. Despite this, I found the front desk and hotel manager to be rude and prejudiced upon check in. In total, I stayed almost a week at this hotel, on different dates, since Madrid served as my central travel point for various destinations (Andalucia, Ibiza, etc.) On numerous occasions, they never helped assist with the luggage, though I had asked for help repeatedly in Spanish (single female). In addition, they gave me the third degree regarding a travel voucher despite the fact that I had a booking at the hotel under the travel agency (tour operator), and held my passport for an unusually long period of time. They were equally unhelpful with directions and recommendations for restaurants in the area. I also asked them on several occasions when the tour operator Trapsatur was going to begin the city tour of Madrid, and they failed miserably at this task, and refused to call the operator, even though they were right next door to Trapsatur, I missed the tour altogether. They were equally unhelpful with arranging or notifying me of my other airport transfers. As a result, I found myself hating Madrid because of this hotel. It is improperly rated as a 4 star hotel. ROOM DECOR - Dirty and outdated, very old furniture; bathroom not functioning well (shower/toilet), the room view consisted of looking at the other neighboring building's grimy walls, and the police station across the street. The bed was old and saggy and even their quietest room was noisy (sirens and traffic at night). NEIGHBORHOOD - Very shady, next to a strip club. Although it's walking distance to a metro station, the hotel is noisy because it's off the Gran Via (a major street in Madrid), but this area seemed to have many shady characters, homeless people, drug addicts, etc. especially at night. Even during the day, I didn't feel safe as a female solo traveler. OVERPRICED - At over 110 euros a night, this does not provide good value, considering the quality and service of the hotel and its surrounding neighborhood. BREAKFAST BUFFET: very mediocre, and not worth mentioning. CONCLUSION - In the end, I was so fed up with the lousy service, quality and location of this hotel, that I ended up hopping on the express train to Cordoba, and staying overnight at Hotel Occidental Cordoba ( a fine hotel), even though I still had an additional 2 nights booked in Madrid.", "Date": "August 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNot a four star hotel\u201d", "Author": "M&Ben", "ReviewID": "UR5381292", "Content": "We stayed in the Mayorazgo Hotel in June. I was very disappointed by the hotel, we had just come from a beautiful hotel in El Peurto Santa Maria (Hotel Monasterio San Miguel) which was also a four star. There was no comparision between the two. Hotel Monasterio was palacial in comparision and deserved its four star status and more. The hotel Mayorazgo appeared rather shabby and could have done with a good clean. The furniture in the hallway was quite shabby, the upholstery was filthy. Breafast was awful, the cornflakes were soggy and there was tinned fruit, very 70s. I sure this must have been a lovely hotel in its day but it needs to be re-furbished or the grading of the hotel reduced. It does not deserve the four star status. We were lucky that we had a back room and it was nice and quiet but I can imagine if you are other parts of the hotel it may be noisy as the walls are very thin. On the plus side the hotel is very central not far from either metro station Crowne Plaza on Plaza Espana and Santo Domingo on Grand Via. The transport system in Madrid is excellent and it is relatively easy to get around, though we got lost a few times when we were walking around. We travelled from Seville to Madrid by the fast train service is was excellent. This hotel is ok is you are not looking for any frills and it is just a bed to sleep in. There was a nice flat screen tv. There was a topless bar next door but it didn't seem to cause much problems.

The location is excellent as you can walk everywhere and save a bit on cab fares. The downside is that it was somewhat noisy at times, mostly from outside as our room was on the third floor.

Our room was somewhat small and my husband and I thought that the bed would be at least a queen size, since that is what we are used to at other 4 star hotels in Spain. The air conditioning was not in working order, despite our 2 requests to have it looked at. I believe it was repaired on the third night.

Yes,the bedroom walls are thin,thought our neighbours were using our bathroom at one point! There was also a group of high-spirited football fans singing at 3am outside the hotel one night also,possibly on their way to the strip club that is situated 3 doors away from the hotel! The rooms are quite dated and dark,(green faux-leather padding on the wardrobe doors)and our room had no air-con ,which was fine in April,but would make the room stifling in summer months.I must also add that the rooms were spotlessly clean,but overall probably not worthy of a 4* rating. Breakfast was good,plenty of choice.The reception staff were very helpful.The bar and reception areas are comfortable,again the decor could best be described as \"busy\".
