And, if it's more than a walk away, you just hop on the nearby Metro. Everything the Claris has to offer was top rate - the room, the front desk, the rooftop bar, and especially the breakfast, which was included. I've stayed in a number of European hotels, and none of them have come close to the Claris. If there's anything I would change it would be the overwhelming sweet vanilla scent they use in the lobby - it hits you in the nose as soon as you walk in and by the time you get to the elevator you're tasting it - yuck! A little of that goes a long way. We arrived at 9:00 am and were told that checkin is at 3:00 p.m., but they managed to get us into a room by 11:00 a.m. - very much appreciated. I highly recommend this hotel", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cVenerable luxury\u201d", "Author": "HedonistSpeaks", "ReviewID": "UR127966189", "Content": "The Hedonist speaks. We stayed at the Claris hotel in Barcelona. It's near, but not at the top of the luxury market and very nice. Doormen in long white coats are a welcome sight, and probably speak English \u00a0better than you do. The brilliant art in the lobby is a nod to all that is modern inside this venerable building. The rooms are large and well appointed with real art, high thread count sheets (important to a proper hedonist), electrically controlled shades for the windows, and pillows that practically sing a lullaby as they cradle you to sleep. The bathtubs are a bit short by hedonist standards, but typical European, so it's (marginally) forgivable. The staff all seemed to have our comfort in mind and did whatever was necessary to make our\u00a0stay perfect. Wifi is 15\u20ac a day per online device - outrageous and maddening, but not unique. There are free Internet hot spots at some of the cafes throughout the city. The business center has free internet, but you'll need help from the staff to print anything. They have to transfer the page you're printing to a flash drive and take it to one of their computers to print.\u00a0 Their Terrazza restaurant is excellent\u00a0and the small bar by the main lobby (dedicated to Andy Warhol, of all people) has mojitos that are pretty good. (The third one is especially good, \u00a0for some reason.) Get the fourth one and some tapas at \"Josephine\" across the street. (Live jazz Thursday nights starting at 11:30.) If you want weekend dinner reservations, make them on or before Thursday - especially at the better restaurants. The incredibly helpful hotel concierge(s) will do it for you with a smile. Most places open for dinner at 8:30;\u00a0\u00a0many are closed on Sunday, making reservations more of a challenge.\u00a0 \"Il Caff\u00e9 di Francesco\" is the tiny coffee shop one block from the hotel where I went to wake up every day of our visit. \u00a0No i-net here, but it's laden with interesting locals, and the coffee and pastries are good, but not world class. Give it a try. \"AaBC\" is a Michelin star (2 of them!) restaurant. Hedonist foodies must go. It's way north, but worth the 20 minute cab ride. Take a high limit credit card... just sayin'. \u00a0Overheard: \"what wine goes with the woodcock and foie?\" and \"No foam? No smoke? How pedestrian!\" The food is beautiful and fun, if overpriced; the service, immaculate and not stuffy.\u00a0 A word to the wise: if you want to go to the Sagrada Familia, get your tickets at any of the \"Caixa\" ATM's (they're everywhere), or get them online. You'll avoid a very long line. At the caixa, it's easier to get them if you speak/read Spanish. They offer an English alternative, but it's difficult to maneuver through the many pages of authorization - at least it was for me. Use your ATM, or credit card with a 4 number pin. Ticketmaster(!?!?) will issue the tickets directly from the machine. If you want the audio tour (recommended), buy it then to save another long line.\u00a0 When you arrive, \u00a0it can be a bit difficult to tell where to go. If you already have a ticket, get into the line farthest to your right as you face the entrance to the Basilica (nearest the info booth). Everyone has internet, so this line is also not short. The audio units are in a kiosk to the far right behind the little school building after you're inside the grounds. Long lines, but worth the wait. Several times a day, they also offer large group guided tours - not a proper hedonist choice (unwashed masses and all that), but it's there if you want it.\u00a0Be prepared to say, \"Wow!\" Gasps abound. There is something amazing and beautiful at every turn.\u00a0 In the Basilica, there are seats for a thousand voice choir surrounding the chancellory, with four pipe organs planned (one installed so far). I suspect the music at the first mass will be amazing when construction is finished in the middle of the century. \u00a0I'm sorry I won't live that long.

It's spotless -- both the public spaces and the rooms -- and we never wanted for anything in our room: everything was provided for and a quick call to the front desk granted us any add'l requests. The layout of the property is pretty cool -- a spacious entry lobby with a business center and a bar, an easily accessible reception area, light and spacious floors, a roof terrace with a gym, pool, cocktail area, and restaurant, and a basement floor with conference rooms where breakfast was served in the mornings. Everyone was friendly and helpful and prompt. I've stayed in so many hotels where you had to call two or three times to follow up on a blanket you requested 30 mins. ago or an early morning coffee that you ordered the night before -- but not here. Not one things was forgotten or overlooked. We chose this hotel for another reason: the bathrooms were actual separate rooms, like in American hotels. Many hotels we looked at had no door to the sink and shower area; only the toilet room was closed off. We were not sorry we did that. The bathroom was spacious and the products were great! A couple of challenges: the rooms are a little dated and needs some updating. We had a great duplex and it was spacious, but it was a little worn but not a big deal. The bigger challenge was the internet: it wasn't free so you had to call the front desk everyday to request a code, and someone would bring up a card to your room with that code. I wish they would've just made it complimentary or tacked it onto the daily rate. There was a restaurant across the street called Josephine, and it was picture-postcard charming. We ate a lighte breakfast there almost everyday, and they also opened for lunch, dinner, and cocktail hours both in the afternoon and late into the evening and after midnight. Overall, I'd recommend this property wholeheartedly. The staff, including the doormen, were friendly and made you feel welcome. The location can't be beat.

Overall, we were pleased with this hotel. We arrived early in the day (9am) and the hotel upgraded us to an executive room that was ready. Per Trip Advisor reviews, I requested a room facing the center courtyard vs the street. We stayed in room 501. We had no view from our room given the choice to face the courtyard, but it was definitely less noisy than the street side. We live in a NYC apartment, so we are used to occasional noise from neighbors & didn't find it difficult to sleep due to noise from neighboring rooms. Granted we went to bed pretty late & rose pretty late (trying to eat late as the Barcelona locals do) We could definitely hear people talking & water running in our bathroom, but nothing bothersome. We did find that the room could get a bit stuffy at times. There was a heat/air switch, but it didn't seem to work that great on the cool setting. We found a big move towards conserving energy, and guessed that the hotel was limiting the time the level of the a/c. If the windows opened (they were locked), this may have eliminated this concern. We both thought that we might not want to stay here in the summer if the a/c could be a concern. (It was in the 40s & 50's most of our trip) The doormen, front desk staff & the housekeepers were all very pleasant & willing to help. There were several metro stops within walking distance. There are many nice restaurants in walking distance. Most of the shopping nearby is upscale chain oriented, but there were a few boutiques too. I preferred the boutiques in the Born area of town as they seemed to have more unique clothing & leather goods.

There was an odor (which turned out to be drying varnish) in the hallway which got worse when we entered the room. We asked to be shown another room. The next room was smaller and the bed was uncomfortable in appearance and more so when sat upon. Once again we asked for another room. After some delay we were told by the manager that the first room was an \"upgrade\" from the original room booking and the only option was another \"upgrade\" for a fee! We decided to try to stay with the first room when we were told that the facility staff knew what the problem was and it would clear in an hour or two. After waiting for about an hour we reentered the room and found that the odor was as bad as before. There was a clue just outside of the room: incense burning in an obvious attempt to cover the other odors! At this point we were tired and decided to try and deal with the problem by opening the windows and airing the room. The odor was not the only problem. There were no chairs, the closet was too small to hang anything more than a few shirts, the TV was not easily viewable from the bed (because there were no chairs the bed was the one place to sit aside from a low bench along the wall), the sink and floor in the bathroom were not clean, there were no tissues, access in and out of the tub was difficult since there was no railing or handle to provide assistance, one of the sheets on the bed was stained, the door to the small refrigerator would not stay closed, no food service in the hotel except at specific times, and finally, the lobby had only limited seating.

The front desk staff pointed us to the bathrooms downstairs and said they would call us when our room was ready but it would be no later than 1 or 2pm.

When returning around 3/3:30 our room still was not ready and after hurriedly calling housekeeping we were finally able to check in and go to our room around 4pm.

I learned after the fact this hotel you PAY EXTRA for everything. The nightly rate ($270) was absolutely no bargain compared to comparable US hotel stays. Euros or dollars it's a high price. We stayed for two nights, except the first night was about totally opposite from the second night. At the beginning, I agreed with my wife that the room was peaceful and quiet. Well, that all changed on the second evening when apparently the hotel rents out the roof and the pool for parties! A huge party on a Thursday night going on and on to well past 1AM! Not good when you have get up by 6AM to met the plane. We were told when first checking in, that there was a pool on the roof, plus a bar and dinner entrees. Just assumed it was for the hotel guests only. On each floor next to the elevator doors is a small podium which listed the dinner entrees available that day on the roof and price. We were also told \"breakfast is served below the lobby between 7AM and 10AM\". Great I thought! Since we already experienced a delicious free breakfast buffet in Verona Italy, I was looking forward to more European fare... Not until we sleepily turned in our key at the hotel desk at 7AM did we see our supposedly pre-paid bill had been added to... a $32 charge for EACH of us for a measly breakfast we now regret ever having in their tiny basement! No where when we went downstairs the first morning, was there any indication that there was a charge. A huge charge! Considering it was only a few slices of fruit, little wedges of cheese, and very runny scrambled eggs. A waiter motioned that we must go to a specific table right next to the buffet table. Since I thought it was free, I dare not use tables in a more secluded spot. Since we thought it was free we even gave the waiter a tip!

This is a nice hotel, fabulous reception area, modern, fresh and clean, and the bar/restaurant on the roof terrace is wonderful with a nice, modern sitting area with sofas and tables, then an inside part for the restaurant and a pool next to this (which we did not use as it was not heated and it was fairly chilly) however the bar was very overpriced but we expected this from a four star hotel in the center of Barcelona, however if you walk just minutes in any direction you can literally buy the same drinks for nearly half the price. The staff in all areas of the hotel are friendly and extremely helpful, they recommended some gorgeous restaurants and were happy to make us reservations. Breakfast was nice, fresh fruits, yogurts, pastries, breads, juices, coffee and they also offered a hot menu which was cooked on request which was very nice and the waiter in the restaurant offered fantastic customer service. The only down side to the hotel was the rooms, they were extremely dated and worn compared to the rest of the hotel; the rugs, the curtains and furniture needs to be replaced, and the room as a whole was small, dim and over looked some residential flats and gardens, however this is to be expected in a large city. The beds were comfortable and the maid service was fantastic, cleaning and tidying the rooms twice a day, and leaving complimentary chocolates on our pillows each night for when we got home, with some slippers and cotton mats laid out next to our beds, nice touch. The location of the hotel was good, but not fantastic, La Ramblas and the port were about a 30 minute walk away, as were the Picasso and Gaudi museums and we had to get a taxi which cost approx 13euros each way to the Nou Camp. However there was a lot of authentic Spanish bars, tapas bars and restaurants close to the hotel which we prefer to the tourist bars and restaurants anyway, so it was a bonus. The main shopping street was only a 5 minute walk as well, which is handy for those who go to Barcelona to shop.

If you are a fan of the work of Antonio Gaudi you will find Casa Batlo and Casa Mila within an easy walk of the Hotel and La Sagrada familia a short taxi ride away. As a family we were required to take out two rooms which were right next door to each other but not interconnecting as we were told this option is not an available configuration within the Hotel. Having to take two rooms made our 5 day stay considerably more expensive but after researching Hotels we chose The Claris hoping it had a \"WOW' factor. I have to say that although the staff at The Claris were professional and seemingly well trained the Hotel's public areas,restaurants and accommodation should really only rate at a 4-4.5 star going by European standards.The rooms are adequate in size and moderately furnished - nothing luxurious though. Despite the \"dirty\" windows being double glazed traffic and street noise can still be heard in the rooms facing the street especially in the early hours.The bathroom was spacious enough and there was a shower over a bath situation which was OK if you were able to climb in and out of the large bathtub - I would not recommend this though for elderly guests or young children. There was a nice arrangement of \"Derby Hotel\" toilettries on offer and bathrobes/slippers in the wardrobe if required. I always expect 5 star properties to offer tea and coffee making facilities in the room for their guests but this was not available at The Claris - not even complimentary bottles of water. During our stay (January/winter) the rooms were extremely hot and despite having the air conditioner on the lowest setting we were uncomfortably warm at times. When I enquired about this we were told they were on \"set\" settings - doesn't really make sense!! We only had breakfast once at the Hotel which was pleasant but pricey for what it was - the buffet was fairly standard with a few cold chef prepared items to jazz it up and if you wanted something hot then it was made to order. Fresh orange juice and coffee was also available but it was served by the Restaurant staff so you had to wait for \"top ups\" rather than having the pot at your table which was a bit controlling for my liking. We wanted to eat dinner at the hotel (although pricey) but the menu was just not that appealing or expansive enough to accommodate for the likes of our family. So, after enquiries at Reception we found an unreal Tappas Bar a few blocks away which was reasonable and delicious and we also ate on the Passage de Gracia just a block away from the Hotel most days for things like Pasta, Pizza, Tappas etc. All in all we loved our stayed in Barcelona...the hop on hop off buses are a fantastic way to get around and the taxis also offer a terrific service. There is so much to see and do in this great Modernista city that you really must allow at least 2 full days to explore it's vast attractions. Last note on The Claris - pleasant Hotel in a great location with professioanl staff but sadly it did not have the \"WOW\" factor I would expect from a 5 star Hotel in the Small Luxury Hotels of the World Group.If you want to stay here then make sure you get a great rate otherwise you may be disappointed with the cost v's value for money ratio. PS. Unknowingly we also arrived on a special celebration day in Barcelona \"The Kings Parade\" . If the Hotel Manager had organised a nice letter to be placed in all guests rooms advising them of this festival then we may have had the opportunity to attend this colourful parade. Also...the following day was a Public Holiday in Barcelona so apart from a few food outlets/cafes being open nearly everything else was closed!!

I decided to splurge a bit on the Claris for this trip. While I had a pleasant stay, I don't think that the price differential between, e.g., the Astoria (about 60 euros) and the Claris (about 120) was represented good value for money spent. The Claris definitely has some pluses: the location is superb, the public areas of the hotel are stylish, and the staff I dealt with were very friendly and service-oriented. There are more amenities at the Claris than the Astoria (e.g., restaurant, bar, gym etc) and that no doubt is part of the reason for the price differential. However, there were a few, somewhat less satisfactory elements. First of all, the decor is a bit tired and dated - it needs refreshing, a coat of paint here and there, etc. Second, the bed was rock hard. (I like hard beds, but this was too hard for me.) Third, while there is a gym in the hotel, it is miniscule and fitted out with old machines. The single treadmill, for example, looked like the one I bought 2nd-hand 20 years ago. The rooftop room was cold (with no way I could see to turn on the heat). I realize one generally doesn't stay at the Claris to use the gym, but if a hotel is going to offer a gym, it should keep the equipment up to date. The pluses at this hotel outweigh the minuses, but as other reviewers have said, this isn't a 5* hotel in terms of luxury level, even if it does have the amenities typically associated with a higher-end hotel. The next time I'm in Barcelona, I very likely will stay at a Derby Hotel - but one that offers better value for money spent.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood, but not great!\u201d", "Author": "cabernetsue", "ReviewID": "UR94146116", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Claris from the 15th January 2011 for seven nights in order to explore the City. The hotel is located one block from Passeig de Gracia where there is an excellent selection of regular and high-end retail stores as well as numerous bars and restaurants. The hotel is well positioned for the Barri Gotic and also the districts of Eixample and Gracia. It is quite feasible to walk to the waterfront but it took us around half an hour to do so. Placa de Catalunya is located at the top of La Rambla and if you are visiting for just the weekend and want \u201ctourist Barcelona\u201d this might be a more convenient location. The area around the Hotel Claris is quieter and perfectly pleasant with plenty of shops, bars, and restaurants close by. It felt very safe to us both day and night. We did not eat at the hotel restaurant purely because there is a staggering choice of venues in the City. We would recommend Josephine\u2019s (directly opposite) and the Vinoteca wine bar and shop, which is a five-minute walk north on Pau Claris - small but serves its own excellent wines and the best tapas that we found all week - highly recommended! As for the Claris, we found the staff very attentive and helpful and the majority had some English. The common parts to the hotel are maintained to a very high standard, namely the reception, bar, restaurant, corridors, roof terrace and pool. The hotel\u2019s East 47 bar was quiet during our stay, and whilst a little small it was perfectly comfortable. We stayed in a junior suite at the Claris which was a good size with a separate seating area. The television had a reasonable number of channels in various languages but screen size and picture quality were not great. The suite was comfortable enough and quiet but unfortunately the bathroom was disappointing. The shower and bath were combined, and not well maintained. The bath had lost its enamel finish around the plug and drain holes, and really looked quite tatty. Some of the surrounding tiling and grouting was also discoloured. The shower is mounted behind a fixed glass screen and we suspect it was not always cleaned as it should be, as to do so would have required standing or kneeling in the bath.

Our stay was an great experience until the last morning at check-out. When we checked in, we were greeted by a front desk attendant, who informed us that breakfast was complimentary and served between 7:00 and 11:00. Upon reviewing our bill, however, we noticed a charge totaling 84 EUR (approx. $112.00) that was for 4 breakfasts . When we questioned the front desk attendant (a different individual than the one who checked us in) about these charges, he told us breakfast was not complimentary and ridiculed us for not reading the Claris Hotel website more carefully. We attempted to explain to him what we had been told upon checking-in and were met with additional rude and disrespectful comments. He never offered an apology for the confusion, despite the fact that the gentleman told us - in English - that breakfast was complimentary. Because we did not desire to continue dealing with this individual, we presented our credit card for payment. After giving the attendant a credit card to pay for the room, he informed us the card had been declined. We explained that there was plenty of credit on that card, but were met with - once more - a rude and condescending attitude. Because there were numerous people attempting to check in at that time - and we had already been humiliated enough - a different card was presented for payment. As we knew would happen, after leaving the hotel and checking with the credit card company, we were informed there was ample room on the first (allegedly declined) card to cover the stay. We were also informed that the attendant RAN THE CARD AS A CASH TRANSACTION rather than a credit for some inexplicable reason. Had he run the card as a credit card, as requested, the entire experience would have been avoided. Additionally, he failed to inform us that he was running the card as a cash transaction; had he done so, we could have corrected him and, once more, avoided the embarrassment and hassle of this situation. The real shame of the aforementioned experiences is that - up until this morning. And because of this, we are sad. As it stands now, after being treated the way we were, we will not only never stay at Claris Hotel-Barcelona again (or a Derby Hotel for that matter), but we will also never recommend this hotel to our friends and family. Lastly, when we emailed the hotel an explanation of everything that afternoon after checking with our credit card company, his response was embarrasing to the hotel industry. I have NEVER been treated like that by a hotel you spend $1000.00 with over 4 days. I was disgusted.

The main snafu occurred at check-in which unfortunately tainted the remainder of our experience there. I am pregnant and had requested a no-smoking room. We were shown up to our 'non-smoking' room which reeked of cigerette smoke. I mentioned this to the receptionist who had shown us up there and she made a phone-call to the lobby and asked us to wait in the room while they figured out an alternative room for us. So far so good. Five minutes later we were called by the lobby and asked to come downstairs where we saw the another receptionist yelling at the lady who had shown us to our room saying that she shouldn't have told us to stay in that room because ''now we will have to clean that room!!!' All in plain view of us! And to make matters worse another receptionist told us very matter-of-factly, that 'yes, that was a smoking room. Now we will have to wait for a non-smoking room. Which could take another hour.' No apology!! My husband and I decided to wait in the lobby for our room. I want to note that I was visibly 7 months pregnant and a 5-star hotel would be a little more accommodating rather than have us wait for hours in their lobby. Its the little things that count and unfortunately the service at this hotel is sub-par. One annoying thing was the lack of free wireless internet. In the year 2010 I really do not understand why the Claris is charging for it. Initially I thought it was a Europe thing but I have stayed at plenty of hotels in Europe (a lot that are 5star) that offer free wireless. Moving onto the hotel. The hotel itself is nice . It is a small boutique hotel with a lot of trendy pieces of art being displayed. It is a block off Passeig de Gracia so its not that noisy. The rooms are a decent size, uncarpeted with a lot of wooden furniture. Nice bathroom with slippers, a bathrobe, hairdryer etc. There is a rooftop pool with a bar area around it that is quite nice. There is also complimentary coffee or tea that is delivered in the morning. Unfortunately the coffee was provided without milk so I would hold out and get my morning coffee from one of the cafes outside. Its in a good location-with most of the sights within the walking distance plus there is a taxi stand right outside the hotel so it was always easy to get a taxi. I do want to to say that the concierge we spoke to (Maureen) was lovely. She recommended some great restaurants, helped us make reservations and was generally super helpful. Also the white-jacketed doormen were very gracious, always smiling and ready to call you a taxi. Overall, its a good hotel, just not great. A 5-star hotel must provide exceptional service which unfortunately the Hotel Claris failed to do in our case. While not all the receptionists were unfriendly, the few that were (especially those involved with our check-in) made it a less than satisfactory experience for us.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAll-Round Excellence\u201d", "Author": "rokisrani", "ReviewID": "UR84304112", "Content": "If you want a 5* hotel that is in an ideal location, has exceptional service and great views of the city then I cannot recommend a better hotel...

Reported to reception who say it will stop in an hour, so being unable to sleep for early morning departure decided to write review instead. The welcome to the hotel was fine, especially the later flourishes. The arrangement of the suite good. Large bed, bathroom with large bath, double sinks and shower over bath, dining table and on duplex floor a pleasant lounge. We checked in early in the day having arrived from night train, and were given a very welcome early check-in, but became clear through banging that there was building work in next door building. Reported to reception, but there was not another available equivalent room away from the adjoining wall. The noise from that came to be tolerable as occasionally background noise. The rooms themselves because of the hardwood floor laminates, insulation and plumbing could be noisy, though at their noisiest when housekeeping were cleaning adjacent rooms as one might expect. The lifts/ elevators tended to cause a low level hum in the room as they went up and down, but that wasn't reported to reception as an issue since there seemed very little to be done about it. The emptying of sinks, WCs and baths elsewhere tended to be heard as falling water too. Some small details missed, like an obviously broken bin in bathroom that one expects a hotel like this to simply replace, but not done until second time of asking. That's just niggles though. We were able to sit around the rooftop pool on all but one occasion when it was too busy, and it was not the hotel's fault that there was road works below that were noisy. The pool I'm told was unheated and cool, and lounging on the rooftop otherwise pleasant. Very much liked the location of the hotel and tended to walk everywhere from it, though there are also nearby metros and a taxi rank opposite. Breakfast was fine, though we tended to be left to our own devices once seated and served juice and tea/coffee. Bed lovely to sleep in. Enjoyed the visit. At times, would have liked a little more friendliness. Location great. Aesthetics of hotel and in-suite art great. Melted marks in bath less so. Our particular suite felt noisy from internal noises despite not having a window to the street, and was surprised at the earlier volume of tonight's rooftop noise, though it is less now at 11:45pm. Nevertheless, looking forward to silence later. As Barcelona is a vibrant city at night, late neighbour doors and sounds are naturally going to occur, but felt the hotel could be quieter in its own structure and operation. For instance, can hear sound of large number of people from roof singing and applauding now at gone midnight, someone whistling in next door room, large rolling wardrobe doors heard from room on other side, hum of busy elevators, and echos of people in corridor. Still feel privileged to have the opportunity to stay in such a place overall.

I can\u2019t speak to the restaurant as we didn\u2019t eat there however we did have a few drinks while lounging up next to the pool and that was nice. We happened to be staying at Hotel Claris on the night of the World Cup finals and ended up watching the entire match in a viewing room the hotel had set up next to the restaurant. Wanting to avoid the huge crowds on the streets, it was nice to still be able to join in the spirit of the finals without venturing out. 4) The rooms themselves were fine \u2013 we stayed in two different rooms, each with a King bed and couch. We had a slightly larger room our second and third nights that had a view out the front of the hotel and this room had a raised area for the bed and step down \u201cseparate\u201d sitting area which lead to the exit hallway and bathroom. The bathrooms were large by European standards and there was plenty of closet space. A safe was provided although the instructions were a bit confusing (again, see below). Noise was not too bad while in these rooms but they were typical of big city hotels where you can hear sirens, horns, street noise, etc. 5) There is a taxi parking area right across the street which is very convenient. Negatives: 1) The front desk staff seemed aloof and was not very customer oriented. As we entered the hotel, no one at the front desk even acknowledged us with a greeting. I finally went up to the counter and after a moment, an employee looked up and I actually greeted that person first! We just felt it was poor customer relations. They weren\u2019t rude necessarily, just not welcoming. Even the manager acted perturbed when we had to have our in-room safe reopened. We were unfamiliar with this type of safe, had mistakenly locked it, and were just asking for help but this seemed to be an inconvenience to the manager. My wife said he even \u201crolled\u201d his eyes behind my back when I asked for a quick demo of how to work the safe again. Very unnecessary to act this way, we felt, and maybe this attitude spread down to his employees. 2) We never saw a concierge the whole time we were there although there seemed to be a concierge desk. The front desk personnel did help us with directions when asked and so we found our way to the nearest Barcelona tourist information site for assistance with tours, etc. 3) Pay for use internet \u2013 an upscale hotel like this should provide free internet to the customers, in my opinion. 4) The elevators were very small - my wife and I had to take separate elevators when we headed down with our bags. Any group larger than 3 people has to take separate elevators so not too family friendly in that respect. Overall, an above average hotel experience but due to the \u201ccold shoulder\u201d from the front desk staff and the one manager we encountered, we probably would try a different hotel next time as there are many comparable hotels in Barcelona. I would think with the amount of competition in this city, pleasant customer relations would be a priority.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "rome", "Title": "\u201cstay away\u201d", "Author": "ondina2009", "ReviewID": "UR71452043", "Content": "there was a room, but with the swimming pool on the roof very NOISY all day long. there was a roof swimming pool, but with VERY dirty water, there was a breakfast, but in the basement instead of on the roof there a was a bath, but dirty there was a TV, but with pay movies only there wa a fitness room, but small and dirty the staff is very young, but unfortunetely very unsure.

It was the absolute worst experience I've ever had in a hotel. When we checked in, the front desk switched the room we chose and paid for online saying they didn't have what we ordered available. So they gave us a small suite in the back of the hotel with a tiny window and a view of the buildings in the back alley. The house keepers did a lousy job of cleaning the room. Upon check-out, the front desk staff coerced us into taking a cab to the airport which we were grossly overcharged for. When we came down to the cab, we found it had been running the meter long before we arrived and had racked up over 10 Euros in fees. The cab driver refused to blank out the meter when we refused to get in her taxi and pay for the time she waited for us before we even drove anywhere. When I insisted the that front desk call us another car service, they rudely refused. Because we had little time to continue arguing as we had to make an international flight we were basically forced to take the cab to the airport. On the way, the cab driver basically admitted she paid members of the hotel staff under the table to be on of the only cars they called for their guests. That explains why the front desk wouldn't accommodate us with another car and didn't care how awful we were treated by the cabbie. This kind of nonsense is something I would expect from a motel in a shady part of town, not an expensive hotel like the Claris.

I booked a Suite in the hotel\u2019s website at the rate of 353 Euros per night (tax + breakfast included). To start with, some of the staff treated me in a very familiar way and they behaved as if we were friends, they didn\u2019t keep the distance that has to be between the client and the employee. To follow, the suite is small taking into account that it is a 5*GL. For example the smallest Suite in any Four Seasons is 80 sq. m. (and this year I\u2019ve stayed twice at the F. Seasons in Buenos Aires, so I know what I am talking about), and the room was in a deplorable state of neglect. Part of the ceiling is full of cracks due to humidity and it was never repaired. It seems that there was a leaking in the wall as it is full of stains that nobody bothered cleaning (see pics). The room is divided in two rooms by a sliding door. The room and the bathroom don\u2019t have any window at all, which equals to zero ventilation (see pic). The wood floors are all scratched as a consequence of moving furniture around or adding beds (see pic). Last but not least, the furniture is just deplorable too! It gives the impression that they have gone to a second hand store and bought some spare pieces and cheap furniture and they put them together with the existing one, so nothing matches with nothing. For instance, there is an old English style wood table with three plastic black chairs!!!!! I\u2019ve sent a three pages letter with the pics to the General Manager. The day that I left the hotel he came to apologize for the inconveniences and he deducted 100 Euros from my bill. I go very often to 5*GL and as far as I am concerned, that was not a solution. I don\u2019t want to sound pretentious but if I can afford to pay 350 euros daily I expect to have a comfortable stay, and 100 Euros less in the final bill doesn\u2019t make any difference.

Had never experienced a hotel asking for payment on room stay up front. We let them put thru the charge because we were going to be there but were puzzled and he gave no explanation.

Like many frequest travellers I am curious how hotels of different styles, age, service, facilities etc....can equally be classified under a particular star rating as there often seems to be inconsistent offerings. While I have learned to accept this I can not accept a same star rating (5 Star GL) for two hotels owned by the same Group where their customer offerings are wildly inconsistent. I stayed in the Hotel Urban in Madrid in early August and could find no fault with this property or its positioning in the 5 Star GL market. I had looked forward to my stay in its sister hotel in Barcelona. Was I disappointed.................. I had requested early check in due to flight timings and was informed on arrival that the room was not ready, which was not an issue. The manager of the hotel was on hand to greet us on arrival and as part of our booking upgrade we were to get a complimentary glass of champagne and a room upgrade. Wonderful I thought! We were given a room to freshen up and then go to the roof top bar for our drink. When it came to signing for the drink the barman could not deal with it as complimentary as we had not been assigned a room! I paid! I am still waiting on my complementary drink................... We were given access to the room at 2:30pm. The upgrade room was duplex, which is a category down from the junior suite originally booked! We were then taken to another upgraded room. We had lost interest in complaining. After a while the various noises were a curiousity. I then worked out that our room was directly below the roof top pool! Noise of loungers being dragged along and all the splashing around. The pool closes at 8. The hotel makes reference to its \"total sound proofing\" - even the quiet summer time traffic of Barcelona centre was audible. If this qualifies as an upgrade, I dispare. As for the room......... the hotel prides itself on its antiques collection and boasts at least one piece in every room. Perhaps I missed it, but there was no obvious antique in the room. The advertised tea/coffee facilities did not exist, no iron/ironing board was to be made available - meaning (costly) hotel services had to be used. This is entirely unacceptable.

While I'm not sure it deserves its five-star rating, we were pleased with many things the hotel offered. First and foremost, the Claris is located in one of Barcelona's most elegant neighborhoods\u2013\u2013L'Eixample. It's a stone's throw from Paseo de Gracia, one of Western Europe's most beautiful boulevards. Within walking distance from the hotel, we were able to tour La Pedrera, Casa Batllo, Placa de Catalunya, Las Ramblas, and Gaudi's unfinished masterpiece, Sagrada Familia. A little further away, but still within walking distance, was the Bari Gotic quarter. There are numerous caf\u00e9s and restaurants within walking distance of the Claris. At 25 euros per person, there's no need to take breakfast at the hotel as there are excellent, moderatey priced caf\u00e9s right around the corner. Plus, it's infinitely more fun to frequent places where the locals go. Also within walking distance is Dow Jones, an American-style sports bar, where we were able to catch the Patriots and Giants playoff games. The hotel combines an Old World European facade with modern amenities. Glass elevators overlooking the hotel's interior whisk you to your room, all furnished with antique kilim rugs and Brazilian cherry floors. My husband and I happen to like modern furnishings, so we were very pleased with the d\u00e9cor. The hotel's staff was uneven at best. Some people, especially bell staff and doormen, were extremely helpful and attentive, but some front desk personnel were rude and impatient. There were very few English speaking television channels, and by the end of the week we started to grow tired of the steady dose of CNN and Sky News. Our in-room movies, something you expect at a five-star, were not working and the front desk was unable to fix it.. It was January and the hotel was not busy, so the staff accommodated us by giving us access to the room next door. There's a small collection of museum-quality Egyptian antiquity on display on the second floor, which is definitely worth a look. There's also a rooftop bar/restaurant and pool, but since we were there in January those facilities were not operational. On the flip side, January was a perfect time to visit Barcelona.

The reason why we ended up at 2 is because we initially booked our reservation at the Claris, and after 1 night we swtiched hotels. I was mildly unsatisfied, my husband as the business traveler was MAJORLY unsatisfied. The lobby was nice and modern in design. We arrived at the hotel at around 9:30pm and there were 2 gentlemen to greet us. They were busy behind the desk and weren't extremely welcoming or attentive. However, they did manage the check-in and a very nice bellhop showed us to our junior suite. The junior suite was located on the first floor directly off of the elevator. When we entered the room the decor was very dark and reminded me of something you might expect in a lodge in the southwestern part of the US (Arizona or New Mexico maybe). There were hardwood floors (dark reddish brown tones) with rugs on them. Everything in the room was very low to the ground. The bed, the television, the couch. There was a small table with chairs next to the entryway and then upon entering the room there was a couch on one wall with the bed facing it. A flat screen tv was facing the bed and was mounted so that it stood about 1 foot off of the floor. which meant that if you were sleeping in the bed, you would not be able to really see it unless you were propped up. There wasn't a desk area in the room unless you wanted to work on that small table by the door.... I proceeded to unpack while my husband attempted to do some work on his laptop. He was literally logging into the laptop every 15 minutes because the internet connection wasn't working. After 2 hours he called the front desk and they sent the bellhop to our room to try and assist with the wireless connection. A failed effort as the bellhop knew nothing about wireless connections. Finally, at around midnight--my husband had to go to the lobby and work from the lobby for about 2 hours (to access the internet connection). I couldn't get the air conditioner to turn off all night so we were freezing in our bed. My last complaint-the sheets were not soft! I was surprised and unsure if this was a Spanish thing.

When we came back, not only did we have our room, but they had moved our luggage into the room. And let me tell you, the room was worth the wait. We had a 2 floor duplex. The first floor had the main bathroom (separate shower and bath) as well as a Sauna (looked a little small, but what can you expect for a private sauna). It also had the living room/dining room with comfortable couch and chairs and big screen flat tv/ Upstairs had the bed and another full bath (no sauna). Another great feature was the tv, which seemed to have movies you could rent, and, most importnatly, 5 english speaking channels (CNN Int'l, CNBC Europe, BBC World, Sky News and Disney). There was nice art in the room, and we were left a rose. They also gave us a bottle of red wine. On the negative side, the room was not up to the level of cleanliness I like. The sink in one of the bathrooms was not clean and the floor was dirty/dusty. I normally do not wear the hotel slippers (my feet are too big). But fortunately, their slippers were a little bigger since I needed them. Service was also a little spotty. While everyone was helpful (including the door man who remembered that my wife and I wanted a non-smoking restuarant and asking how dinner was), there was one mess up that bothered me. We had the hotel make reservations in advance. They made excellent suggestions and we loved 3 of the 4 restaurants. However, we had a bad experience the night before in Madrid where we went to a smoking resturant. Therefore, when we picked up our reservations, we asked if they were all for non-smoking restaurants. We were told that they were. However, the first one was smoking only. We left and went back to the hotel. They found us a non-smoking restaurant nearby, but not us fancy or nice. They followed up with phone calls to ensure that the rest of the restaurants were non-soking (they were). Breakfast was a buffet. Very nice selection of breads and an excellent choice of fruits. You could also order food (such as eggs, pnackages, breakfast meats, etc), but they do not tell you that. Last, we enjoyed the car they provided to take us to the airport (included in a stay of 3 nights or more). However, agan ask for non-smoking since at least one car reaks of cigarettes.

The remainder of our experience was similarly classy in gracious hospitality. The buffet breakfast was varied, fresh, and tasty. Dinner at the terrace restaurant was delicious.

Inside our check-in was handled swiftly and efficiently and we were given maps of the city and local information without asking. The room we had booked was a duplex, which was on the second floor. It did seem strange however that upon entering you find yourself in the bedroom and then have to go up the stairs to the living area. Most duplexes I\u2019ve had in the past have the bedroom upstairs which tends to make for far better use of this type of space.

The window overlooks a busy main road and doesn\u2019t open. Traffic noise was evident throughout our stay. While the d\u00e9cor is pleasant the furniture and fabrics are rather on the worn side. The bathroom is very small and rather old fashioned. The shower is extremely powerful but always flooded the floor due to inadequate screening. The bath products were of the cheap un-named variety. Disappointing for a hotel that\u2019s supposed to be 5* Gran Luxe. The worst aspect of this room was the very hard and uncomfortable bed. The mattresses are the sort that cave in the middle slightly from overuse. The bed linen is actually real linen, which is a nice touch, but what good is that with a bad mattress? And why no duvet / comforter? Just a cotton bed cover, which again didn\u2019t help. The air-conditioning vent for the bedroom was situated directly over the bed and even on the lowest setting resulted in wafts of chilled air over one\u2019s head while trying to sleep. Breakfast was served in a lower ground floor room and was a buffet. Plenty of variety and attentive service. The small roof top pool wasn\u2019t anything spectacular and with six people around it seemed rather crowded.

A particularly nice touch was complimentary aromatherapy bath oil delivered to our room on the first night.

We got on the internet and reviewed our notes, quickly called the Claris and were lucky to find availability at a very good rate for our 8 day stay. We are experienced travelers and enjoy staying in 4 and 5 star resorts wherever we go. From our first phone call to check-out, we were treated like VIP'S by Ricardo and his staff. We found the Claris to be a charming boutique hotel only a few blocks from the Ramblis. It is convenient to exciting areas, very friendly and quiet. The suites are like little apartments but with no kitchen, and we preferred the floor plan that was all on one floor because it felt more spacious, rather than the floor plan where the sitting area was a loft. We were thrilled with the help and recommendations given to us by Victoria, their Guest Relations Person. We had some of the very best meals we have ever had thanks to her suggestions (we don't like fish or meat...so eating in Spain was a bit of a challenge for us). We HIGHLY recommend the Ming Dynasty for delicious Chinese, Bembi for perfectly seasoned and beautifully presented Indian and the magnificently appointed Thai Gardens. I must add that the breakfasts at the Claris were extremely satisfying and pleasantly served. We also enjoyed \"hanging out\" at the Magestic Hotel (down the street) for its piano bar and roof-top refreshments and view. It is a bit pricey, but it gave us the lounge experience that the Claris was lacking.

We studied our choice of hotels, and The Claris continued to be a top choice, and our final decision. The Claris is a member of the excellent group of hotels called Small Luxury Hotels located throughout the world. They are expensive, but known for the high quality while staying on the small side with outstanding personal service. The Hotel Claris was built in 1992 keeping the facade of the former Palacio Vedruna. Barcelona has been working very hard to upgrade and improve on its elegant architecture, and although the exterior of this hotel appears very old, the interior is an entirely different story. The Claris is a crossroads experience of the past, present and future. Behind the palatial facade you discover a private pre-Columbian Art collection, and one of the most extensive museums of Egyptian relics in Europe. The modern interior is quite a diversion from what you might expect. Everything is crisp and clean, simple, but elegant in design.....almost mysterious. We arrived in Barcelona by ship, and were at the hotel at 10:00am. It was too early to check in, however, they were more than gracious to put our luggage in a safe place and invite us to have lunch, or just stroll around the city. We returned several hours later and our room was ready. The reception desk was most interesting in appearance with a beautiful burled wood wall. All of a sudden, the person that had been helping us went to check on something and he was gone. The wooden wall was actually secret doors to the back, and with a swift push he disappeared...quick to return, I might add. The staff was most friendly and always willing to be helpful. They arranged a tour for us and best of all gave us a list of the best Spanish brandies and were to buy them. All of the 120 rooms, have been decorated with a mixture of modern contemporary and classic styles. There are over 100 antique kilim rugs, 17th and 18th century English and French furniture, and many sculptures from the 2nd to 7th centuries. All rooms are air-conditioned, several phones, satellite TV, a safe, mini-bar, desk, and sofa. The bathrooms are quite the most beautiful, done in coral marble with fresh flowers attached to the mirror in little tubes. We had the standard room, which was a little on the small side, but still a good value at $175 US including a grand breakfast and taxes. The hotel has three restaurants, one being the Caviar Restaurant, which didn't appeal to us. However, the main one, on the lower level was where breakfast was served as well as dinner. Breakfast was a buffet style with every imaginable pastry, meat, and more than enough to last you for a week. Several nights we ate dinner there also, where they have a fixed price menu including wine. I loved with spinach soup with scampi! The price per person was about $30....not bad at all, and well worth it. There is a restaurant on the roof, however we were there in the Spring and it was not open yet. Yes, we enjoyed this hotel so much, but best of all, it was just one block away from the Paseo de Gracia, the heart of Barcelona. We were able to walk everywhere from this convenient location. So, are you looking for a special place to stay while you are visiting this marvelous city? You need to seriously consider the Claris, it is a good value, and a most interesting hotel!", "Date": "September 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex UK", "Title": "\u201cMore of the same\u201d", "Author": "DeeEmm", "ReviewID": "UR5817237", "Content": "Like previous reviewers, we are mystified by the 5 star accolade. The location is excellent and we too found the staff exceptionally good. Our room, although quiet at the back of the hotel, had a grim view. The decor was well maintained if a bit odd colourwise. The bathroom was OK - good size and well equipped. The bizarre thing was the lack of sound proofing from, not next door, but above. We could hear every move they made and even voices. Somewhere in the refurb process, something has gone amiss. Fortunately this only effected one of our 3 night stay. Breakfast was unimaginative although beautifully presented. I thought the roof terrace was grim - the pool uninviting and it only took a few guests to make the whole area feel packed. High above the city, it was noisy and had no view to speak of. Barcelona is a great place - better than Madrid because of its seaside location. Do use the train to get to the city from the airport, it's cheap and convenient. Once in town, use the open tourist bus to get around - it's excellent value and very frequent, but do look carefully before choosing the Claris.", "Date": "September 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheltenham England", "Title": "\u201cGreat rooftop pool!\u201d", "Author": "CheltenhamLady", "ReviewID": "UR5637900", "Content": "This hotel is overated and over priced, however the pool and bar on the roof overlook the hustle and bustle and was very nice.

The rooms are very small - even a junior suite is not large enough for three people. Two people cannot pass between the bed and the wall! Noise - yes, you can hear between the walls easily. If someone coughs in the next room, you will hear it in your room. This is especially true in the anteroom of the suites. Staff - more interested in telling us about how to use their card system to save electricity rather than telling us anything about the room, the hotel or the city. Staff - conceirge did nothing but give out wrong information. Told us hours of things that were closed, etc. Said she would book a car rental for us no problem/ then said need to do 2 - 3 weeks in advance. Reviews of water pressure are correct; it is low. If you stay here, be very choosy about what room you accept - we had a room at the bottom of what amounts to an air shaft - so dark that it was depressing. Luckily, the room was so small that we didn't want to stay in it anyway. Maid service - weak - very nice to have a bag with bottles of toiletries, but when half of them are mouthwash and the other half are body milk and you have no shampoo, you start to wonder. Pool is very very small - really just for a jump in and cool off. Views from roof are not great. After we complained, manager tried to make better but this was already 5 days into a 6 day stay so we had given up. Would definitely NOT rec'd if you are looking for 5 star pampering and luxury. Also, would disagree that this is a great location. Seemed out of the way for most everything. Far from beaches, and clubs and not all that close to many of the best shops and the trendiest neighborhoods. If you are familar with NYC, I would compare it to Park and 88th steet. By subway or cab you can get anywhere, but when you go out the door of the hotel there is really nothing. Lobby is pretty, but so what - with the smokers sitting in it, it becomes not usuable.
