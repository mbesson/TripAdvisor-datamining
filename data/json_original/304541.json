Ochanomizu is a very long walk from the hotel, the nearest station, Yushima, isn't on the main subway lines. It took some navigating and changing trains to find it.The hotel is located up a rather steep hill. Its a long walk up at the end of every day. Didn't look forward to it.There's only ONE free internet access terminal, and unfortunately during my entire 2 weeks' stay, it was hogged by some really inconsiderate caucasians.Many inconsiderate visitors smoke at the lobby lounge, and it can get unbearable.On the other hand, Hotel Edoya's location makes it very quick, convenient, and easy to get to the usual tourist places. Ueno, Asakusa, Tsukiji Fish market, Ginza, Akihabara, are all a direct line and mere minutes away by train.There are coin laundry services, a large relaxation lounge on the top floor, an open roof lounge, a hot sauna room, male  female baths, and a basement restaurant. In short, the facilities are great.The staff are wonderfully friendly, and some of the best I've ever met. They are incredibly helpful, speak a modest amount of english, and served us with an enthusiastic smile for the entire 2 weeks of my stay at Hotel Edoya.I stayed at a Japanese-style room, as is my preference. It was larger and better than I expected, and great value for its price. The attached room-bath was large enough for 2 people to use at once, never had a problem with the hot water, though the toilet did look a bit old. No problems at all with the aircon, cleanliness, and room cleaning.The great location, spacious, clean, and comfortable rooms, great service, combined with the affordable price makes Hotel Edoya one of the best accomodations I've found in Tokyo yet. The hotel even provides free breakfast daily to all guests. This saved me a lot of time and hassle of going out in the morning to look for a place for breakfast. Although I did get sick of the breakfast after a week.The breakfast consists of both Japanese and Western style every morning, at the basement Japanese restaurant.The Japanese menu consists of: Tamago (egg), Salmon Shio (salmon fillets fried in salt seasoning), cabbage, various japanese plums and appetisers (not sure what they are), rice, and a different soup every day (miso, seaweed, etc.)The Western menu isn't as good. Though its the choice for all the caucasians I've seen at the hotel: eggs, toast, sausages, jam, butter, bread.The funny thing is, the breakfast menu never seemed to change, and you can quickly get sick of it. Also, don't spill anything as the lady in charge (little lady in apron) can get quite fierce. I did, and she won't talk to me for the rest of my trip. The restaurant staff seem entirely separate from the hotel staff though, so I wouldn't discredit the hotel for this. Also, every 5 days you stay gets you a free Kaiseki Japanese Dinner worth 3500 yen at the basement restaurant. For this meal, you can choose from a number of items, of which all are of pretty good quality. The meal is good. Enjoy it. Also the staff (old ladies) are in formal kimonos during the evening. They mainly serve japanese salarymen (office workers).There is a laundromat located 1 min's walk away from the hotel, and at least 2 or 3 convenience stores located in the vicinity. The hotel doesn't provide clothes-iron, so I had to sought a laundromat.My advice to get there: Take the cheapest (no reserved seats) train or the Skyliner from Narita Airport straight to Ueno, take a taxi from Ueno. Its so near the taxi metre will hardly tick. It costs just 800 yen or less. This is the fastest+most convenient+cheapest way I have found to get to Hotel Edoya.I'd probably be going back to Edoya next year, so if you stayed there because you read my review, look out for a Singaporean-Chinese couple and say Hi!", "Date": "Dec 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR864166610", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "tnightwind"}, {"Content": "Average ryokan offered friendly service Had a little trouble finding our way from Ochanomizu station.

Large and clean, although starting shows signs of its age (around 30 to 40 years) and dark. Shower was had brown mould/dirt build up though wooden bathtub in surprisingly good condition. Hot water took a LONG time to arrive. Futons comfortably thick and room in a quiet position.Lack-lustre air-conditioning not that great in the middle of a humid summer. Had to walk up tiring hill at the end of each day. One public internet station always occupied and involved frequent trips out of the room to check if available. However, the rooftop area was a nice respite. Good location, and once on the subway; getting anywhere in Tokyo was a breeze.Overall a fairly pleasant stay, but couldn't help but feeling we could have done a little better for our money.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR343425840", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "treiber86"}, {"Content": "Hotel Adorable! My husband and I went to Tokyo for our honey moon with money we received as a gift when we got married. We booked our trip rather late as a result, and had trouble finding a nice place to stay within our price range. Luckily, Hotel Edoya told us they could accommodate us by transferring us to 2 other rooms over the course of our two week stay, which really helped us out a lot.The rooms (japanese style) we stayed in were all very well looked after and very clean. The beds were very comfortable, and I really liked the wooden bath. After a long day walking around the city, it was alway a pleasure to come back to such a comforting, relaxing place.The hotel had a free breakfast everyday, which was not only delicious but a great way to try the japanese option. You have to get up really early to catch it, but with jetlag, this wasn't a problem. The hotel also has free internet (only one computer so you might have to wait, but nice to check e-mails at the end of the day). The also have coin washing machines, and a little roof terrace, and an outdoor bath!The staff were very helpful and welcoming, will help you with directions and give advice about nice places to visit. i thought it was very affordable as well. the location is good, close to a few metro stations and a handful of convenience stores. an amazing place over all!", "Date": "Sep 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR272402234", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "kdfantasy"}, {"Content": "A really fantastic place to stay in Tokyo - great value too! We stayed here in April. We found it easy to book and it was also easy to find. We were close enough to Ueno and several other metro stops so it was an ideal location.

Breakfast was great (go for the Japanese breakfast - way better than the 'western' brekkie!)We stayed for 5 nights so we got a free evening meal in their beautiful restaurant and it was probably the best meal we had in Japan - delicious!Our room was a bit dark but spacious - the toilet was tiny but it was all clean and it felt like we were experiencing something more traditional.

I found everything like I left it two years before: The room is clean and nice (I prefer the japanese styled room). The bath room is clean and functional. The hotel staff is very kind and helpful. Even if there english is not good they do all to help you. They have WLAN in the lobby. They still can not cook a good coffee *big grin*. You have always hot water on your room for green tea and beer in the fride. To sum it up: The hotel has all you need a long day in Tokyo.

If one was so moved, one could eat enough at breakfast to get one to the evening meal. OH WHAT A BREAKFAST ! The basic western ingredients were there ( bread coffee eggs, ) but it was the authentic local cuisine which intrigued me .... new tastes. textures and combinations. And isn't why we travel.

There was a hot spring for relaxation after a hectic day, a computer with fast internet connection, hot water for instant noodles, cool potable water for drinking, etc.Most importantly, the hotel staff were very friendly and polite.

Both were correct. It is a great place to stay for the price and is very close to Yushima station, but yes you do need to climb a huge slope to get there... but if you're like most traveling in Japan, you are used to walking! The staff was friendly - only one spoke very good English, the others did ok. My room was a western style and was clean, but definitely could have used some updating. I was just happy to have a nice bed, a tv (for noise - no English) and a refrigerator. The bathroom area was clean, and the shower was very hot with great pressure, but you could not have paid me to use the bathtub! The hallway carpeting was in a hugely sorry state. I did not use the ofuro, although a Japanese woman had been so it must not have been too bad (?) The free breakfast was good, although I was unaware of what it was I was eating most of the time. The restaurant was very clean. I would stay there again because of the location and price.
