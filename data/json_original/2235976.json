The staff is friendly, common areas are overall clean and comfortable. Breakfast is pretty standard (although bearing in mind that you are in central-northern Europe). The sore point was for the rooms, at least in our experience. On arrival we have been allocated a room on the first floor: it was rather small and uncomfortable and above all very noisy as overlooking Oranienburger stra\u03b2e (bustling and full of bars). They said that there had been an error in the assignments (we booked via internet) and that the next day we could change room. The next morning they showed us two rooms available for a possible change, also on the first floor and small. We decided to choose a room overlooking the quiet courtyard, however forgoing even further comfort. It was an even smaller room with less than essential furniture (very narrow double bed, a desk with 2 small drawers, a long shelf above the bed headboard and shelves instead of bedside tables, no wardrobe but only a coat rack with some clothes hangers) and zero space to store your luggage. Bathroom small but more functional than the sleeping area. We had a nasty surprise respect to images shown on the internet, probably the colorful & contemporary rooms that you see in pics are at the other floors.

It has got a big number 38 on the front, but thats all. But if you know its there, you will find it. There is a little modest reception with nice details as \"welcome/goodbye\" on its wall in various languages. The receptionst are kind and helpful, they tried to answer all our questions. Well the hotel overall suprised us, we booked it as a budget hotel (we had some kind of budget but still didnt want to stay in a hostel or a hotel with shared bathroom) and it exceeded our expectations. First of all, they are selling tripple room as a tripple room. No roll up bed squeezed in a corner, the third bed is a normal bed. Great! Rooms are (would be) stylish, but it works for the first sight and I would give them credits for the effort. Great. Bathroom was spacious, I would only change the white shower curtains, to make the bathroom in the style of the bedroom. We asked for a quiet room and so we had it. Great! TV only plays some kind weird german programms and the only music channel is Rock music, but I dont like to complain about TV as its certainly not what you are making trips for. We were overwhelmed about the breakfast. For this price, just go for it, its amazing! After a great dissapointment in Paris, where they gave us a white bun, a croisant, little butter and jam... this was heaven. The breakfast room was something I have never seen before in a hotel. You could chose from sitting at a big table with other guests or taking some of other small tables on the side to have more privacy. We opted for the long table as it was so family like and very cosy. We came by car, the hotel does not have their own parking places, but if you use the big parking place across the street, and inform the reception, they will give you a discount car. 24hrs parking then costs 10 Eur. The location is just great, walking distance to the Brandenburger gate and all the other sites. The Oranienburgerstrasse is a bit odd, full of prostitutes (but pretty ones, lol) and its not recommended to visit any bar or restaurants there. But we (3 girls) felt safe even walking around late at night.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFor 100 Euro, you find a better value and nights sleep...\u201d", "Author": "Amsterdamtennis", "ReviewID": "UR117502881", "Content": "There were prostitutes patrolling the neighborhood.

It can be cheap if you look for an online deal. Eccentricities include the fact that there is a trick for getting the key to work - ASK or you will spend hours haunting the hallway and waiting for fellow gueststo return -- reception closes ca 5 pm. Owner could be described as tempermental -- but he makes a fantastic breakfast including the best coffee in Berlin: unfortunately there seems to be an unwritten rule that you are only allowed one cup. Everything they say about the pillows is true but not limited to this hotel: somehow the pillows don't seem to have anything in them -- whatever it is offers no resilience. Not good for sleeping but absolute hell if you are trying to read in bed or similar. Re the area, this is very close to best restaurant streets and late bars in the East (but definitely not this street itself). Try the Nord-Sud cafe around the corner, Auguststrasse 87 for truly wonderful French cooking at ridiculous 7 euros for three courses.

It is a budget hotel really, I don't think they have a non-smoking option, the room was small and a little shabby (cigarette burns on the carpet for example) but clean, lovely big fully opening windows but a pity our view was of the fire escape and the back of a pub/restaurant next to the hotel. The breakfast however was fantastic and the noise of the city was fine past midnight even with windows open during the early September heatwave. When you check in you are given keys for both your room and the main shared access door outside. not unusual for these small city hotels, the staff disappear at 7pm leaving only a porter type person but there were no problems with this. The street outside is fun and funky with a great mexican restaurant next door with half price food and cocktails between 5pm and 7pm which I would recomend if you are saving your pennies. Loads of other pubs and restaurants on the street as well. Literally a 2 minute walk to the nearest S bahn station, Oranienburger Strasse and it's very central, nice view of the Fernsehturm from the street, I would recomend this hotel to budget travellers but try to get a slightly cheaper rate if you can!", "Date": "September 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cRecommend 100%\u201d", "Author": "kluttel71", "ReviewID": "UR2815391", "Content": "Super location in the old/new Jewish quarter in Mitte (never mind the ladies of the night on the street outside; they're harmless).
