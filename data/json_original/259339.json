How wrong we were. Upon arrival we had trouble locating the hotel, once found we were presented with what can only be described as a room that wasn't fit for my dog to live in, paint and plaster was falling off the Walls the room was dirty and looked as it hadn't been cleaned for weeks, the bathroom! Was so small that whilst brushing my teeth I was standing in the main room. Needless to say I could continue with my thoughts of the hotel, but I don't think it would help much so I'll just say holidayers beware! If you are planning a city break do not stay here, pay the extra \u00a310 pound per night and find a hotel that has a more reputable name!", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cFair hotel in semi-central zone\u201d", "Author": "fabx70", "ReviewID": "UR56607772", "Content": "Hotel is clean, spacious rooms, friendly staff.

This hotel has a kitchenette which saved us a lot on food. There was a grocery store right down the street. The location was great and saving money by cooking yourself is always good and healthier! I always go to grocery stores when I travel aboad to see how the locals live. So, Warwick House was nice mainly cuz of the kitchenette, the grocery store nearby, and the short distance from the station. Those are all good but that's where it ends. Service was horrible. Asked for batteries for the remote for the TV, never came. After 3 days of asking! Asked for a lightbulb for the light, got nothing until I went searching around the hotel and opened a cabinet and found a lightbulb myself. There is no elevator and the stairs are crooked giving you the feeling you will fall through them. Dust everywhere. Shower is very small. Sheets and blanket look like they are from the 60s. I could go on but I don't want to waste my time. lol Pass on this one and pay more money for another hotel with a kitchenette or whatever suits your boat.", "Date": "June 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands, England", "Title": "\u201cOverbooked and Revolting\u201d", "Author": "DrN0_UK", "ReviewID": "UR19904935", "Content": "I arrived at the hotel at 11pm only to be told that the single on-suite room I had booked was not available and that I should spend the first night in a 'basic single' with no toilet, no shower, no washbasin and no TV with musty dog-blankets on the bed. After complaining bitterly that this was totally unacceptable and that I didn't feel like sleeping in a room the size of a box (2m x 3m) and walking down two sets of stairs and along public corridors to get to the bathroom, they checked to see if any other nearby hotels had any vacancies.

We decided to take the last day of our trip in London and booked a room at Exhibition Court Hotel 3. We got a cheap room at the rate of \u00c2\u00a340 for one night. When we arrived at the hotel there seemed to something wrong with the booking, but they took a copy of my confirmation and it was all ok (they even let a couple of our friends stay in another room at the same cheap price, without booking in advance). I must say I didn't know what to expect after reading some of the reviews here at tripadvisor. But we took our chances, mostly because it was so cheap. We got a room on the 4th. floor and there was no elevator. The room was much better than expected. Clean sheets and generally cleaned everywhere. Yes, you could say the carpets were worn, but that was ok at the rate we payed for the room. The room had ensuite facilities which weren't that bad. The shower was ok, but I couldn't figure out how it worked. Somehow I got water, but it changed from hot to cold water now and then. The toilet was placed below the sink, but it was completely possible to sit on it. The rooms got pretty hot during the night, since there was no airconditioning, but again what should you expect at the rate. There was a small 12\" fan in the room and it help getting some circulation in the air. The personell was friendly. All in all this hotel was ok to stay at for two guys for one night after a festival. But I don't think I will bring my wife to this hotel. Ps. there is a 24hr. Tesco right down the street. They have all kinds of food and beers.

So over the road we went to the grottiest hotel I've ever had the misfortune to set foot in. A few of us were in London for an Exhibition at Olympia so the proximity was good. That's it! We booked a few rooms which were pokey (the single was barely big enough to fir the bed in and didn't have enough curtains for the amount of windows), too hot, smelt bad, really worn, and dirty. Worst of all was the grubby bed linen!!! Yuk. If you must stay here, take a sleeping bag, and an air freshener, oh and ear plugs. And get so drunk that you pass out each night! The tiny kitchen cupboard was not worth the effort because the thought of spending waking hours in the room turned your stomach. Breakfast was served in a tiny room with 2 tables, so it's best to go elsewhere for that!
