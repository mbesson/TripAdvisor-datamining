It was our first stay in a Villa - usually we stay in a hotel. This, we realised, has its pluses and minuses. The pluses include privacy and lots of space (probably too much as we had the 3 bed villa), as well as having your own swimming pool which was great. The minuses are the lack of activities nearby (we hired a travel guide for 2 of the days which was great) and access to the beach was limited.In terms of the accommodation, the villa was extremely spacious but the layout was not suitable for 1 family. 2 of the bedrooms were downstairs, far away from the main bedroom. We couldnt put the kids there (they are only 5 years and 2 years old) so we all ended up in the same room. The 3 beds were a waste. If we were to go back again we would only go for the 1 bed. The quality of the furniture was good (nice sofas and TV) and the bathroom was simply amazing.The staff were generally good (they were excellent with the kids), but the cleaners kept expecting a tip which made us feel quite uncomfortable - they'd smile at us before cleaning the room and be very friendly, but then once they'd finish they would just stand at the door waiting for a tip. Overall, we left the villa with a feeling that this was a good holiday although hotel accommodation would probably be our choice next time. The one thing that really disappointed me though, was that on the way to the airport, I received a phone call saying that I hadnt paid for a Sprite that we drank from the minibar - I was adamant that I had paid for everything, as the bill was presented to me just 15 minutes previously. The lady said she would check and call me back, which she did. 20 minutes later she called me again and said they forgot to put this charge on the bill and they would be charging my credit card with $2. I was extremely annoyed with this given I had spent $1400 for 3 nights and they were chasing me for an extra $2.Anyway, overall a good stay, but some aspects of the villa were a little disappointing. I would try elsewhere next time.", "Date": "Sep 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR320792699", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "srsa1"}, {"Content": "Loved it!

It is a brand new complex in the hills behind the lovely Jimbaran Beach, but I must admit, I felt very let down by this place...We were initially placed in a villa next to an area of noisy construction, which, although consequently we were moved to another, larger villa, two days later, meant that for our first two mornings we were woken up very early due to the banging and construction work just next door. During the day in our larger villa, we were also able to hear the noise in the main area of construction quite clearly. This was a shame as one of the reasons we decided to stay at Gending Kedis is due to the peace and quiet as described in the website. But it was a shame it seemed quite the opposite.The other problem we had is that the villa complex itself is only half-built. This was an issue, because there was absolutely no mention of it on the website or in any of our email correspondence with the management. We may not have chosen to stay there if we had known. As this was our honeymoon, it was a once in a lifetime experience, that we are highly unlikely to repeat, and we would preferred to at least have known this was the case. I had also asked if there was a public swimming pool, but no-one got back to me on that (it was under construction). The person that did get back to me however, said the pools in the villas were 20sqm, which they weren't. Finally, I was under the impression that the spa was available to all guests (another reason for choosing Geding Kedis). We didn't realise we would have our treatments on the floor of our villa!Lastly, we were also not aware that there is no area on the beach available to sit and relax for Gending Kedis clientele. Instead we had to pay $40 per day to use sunbeds in another hotel...again, this is something we would definitely have preferred to avoid.It's such a shame, as the staff were lovely and helpful, and the villa we were moved to was massive and even more luxurious...but it felt like i hadn't been given the full information when I booked...we felt like we had been misled and will know in the future when booking somewhere to double check all these issues.", "Date": "Jul 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR258927967", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "minnie0343"}, {"Content": "Gending Kedis- A Beautiful Bird Song Experience       Bale' Benggong (Balinese Gazebo)", "Date": "Jun 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR858418655", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "GlobalGal70"}, {"Content": "Amazing Stay at Gending Kedis       View from bedroom to the outdoor pool", "Date": "May 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR267104240", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "suitejoe"}, {"Content": "Beautiful Birdsong - Gending Kedis, Bali. After clearing customs at Denpasar airport we were met by our driver, smiling and happy to see us, who then drove us to Gending Kedis. We were checked in and whisked to our sumptuous villa. Even at 2 am it was difficult not to take a dip into our private pool.The morning sunrise brought with it a realisation that we were in supreme luxury. The villa was beautiful and the attention to detail far exceeded our expectations - we assumed an upgrade must have taken place.An invisible army of staff efficiently provided all of the services of the best 5* hotels. When we required assistance our personal butler saw to our every whim and requests were easily accommodated. The manager invited us to view some of the other villas; a very approachable, amiable Scotsman who enjoyed showing us the other accommodation Gending Kedis offers. It became clear all the villas are finished to an impeccable standard. Each villa is individually furnished to suit the position it has within the complex. The level of luxury of ours is attained throughout the villas; to stay in any would be a sublime experience. Our assumption of an upgrade gave much delight and laughter to the manager, who provides this fabulous standard for all guests.The communal areas are beautifully landscaped with an abundance of colourful local fauna, which attracts many songbirds to give the theme tune to our stay, Gending Kedis means \u9225\u6e02irdsong\u9225?in Balinese. It would make an ideal location for family or group holidays, corporate getaways, and the most sumptuous of weddings - I was planning mine after only a few hours there!It would be easy to spend all of your time at Gending Kedis, relaxing by your private pool, sipping cocktails and recharging your body and mind, but Bali has much more to offer. A journey to explore its magical and inspirational beauty and its people is a must. Fortunately a foray out of the complex is easy as the staff are happy to assist in arranging/providing transport and giving advice on the must see attractions. We left feeling completely relaxed and already planning our next trip. Everything was fantastic, our only disappointment being how fast our stay passed.", "Date": "Apr 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR132831806", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bonnieweescot"}, {"Content": "Morning Breeze I\u9225\u6a9de been staying at Gending Kedis for two nights. If you are looking for what I look for, which is tranquility, pristine surroundings with sound of birds but offered in a very nice mix of modern and Balinese work of art expressed in every detail then you will find what I am satisfied about now.I love the bathroom and my spacious room (where I\u9225\u6a93 doing my work now) which is next to the pool overlooking the steep side of the valley with birds chattering. Great for morning swim! Some parts of Bali can be so humid, not here.My comment besides items above is nouveaux and clean!!! Luxurious yet within budget.Well, some villas come with loud tone in some meaningful traditional arts expressed in any way giving you totally different atmosphere \u9225?which most Indonesians love. You don\u9225\u6a9b want to experience that kind of stuff while you want to feel refreshened, your mind renewed and pamper yourself in great environment.

Usually the images we see in Websites are more glossy than the reality. Gending Kedis surprised me by being more than I expected. The finishes were fantastic. Everything was new and extremely tidy and clean. What the website could not convey was the feeling I had being there \u9225?relaxing, a fresh breeze from the elevated position, and a wonderfully calming atmosphere looking across the foliage and valley with the sound of bird calls. Gending Kedis lived up to its name; Bird Song. It was just like being in the mountains at Ubud, yet I was only 15 minutes from the airport and a stroll down to Jimbaran Beach.I was on a business trip so my villa with lounge, kitchen, private swimming pool and a host of other goodies was much more than I needed (or deserved), but given the price and alternatives, my decision to stay there was a no brainer. Besides, my international journalist friends who stayed there during the UN climate change conference boasted about their stay there and I was not going to let them get one up on me. On the way to check in to my villa the manager introduced me to a member of staff who would \u9225\u6e13ook after me\u9225?. I thought this meant just checking me in efficiently. After one day of staying there and finding everything tidied and folded neatly away I realized that I had my own personal butler! Not bad, eh!Perhaps what I enjoyed most of all were the sunset drinks in the bar  restaurant. Cosy and open to the valley view. I really enjoyed those drinks not only with fellow guests but also chatting to the staff. As an experienced traveler, in other places I have suffered both from lack of service and over attentive service that drives me crazy and leaves no privacy.At Gending Kedis it was just right. Every bit of service I needed but delivered in an unobtrusive, friendly and effective manner. The manager and partner in Gending Kedis is actually an experienced International hotelier, and it shows.You can\u9225\u6a9b go wrong staying there.

The place is new and the service was near perfect, given the enthusiastic staff (I guess they simply try harder) and the two room villa we stayed in was large and at the top end of the luxury scale. I switched fro my hotel at Nusa Dua to Gending Kedis villa becasue my friend from Tokyo was staying at this new villa estate. So my family moved in first week fFebruary for four nights.Worth the switch it turned out. Wee thoroughly enjoyed our own private pool in the villa, the spa service which makes house calls and i guess, just basking in the ambience of staying in a top end villa estate -- and to think all this at intro rates which spell real value for money. I can see why staying at a managed villa estate is a totally different exprience compared to a hotel. Walking about, I found out Gending Kedis is just next door to the Four Seasons Jimbaran and I can now safely say the service and facilities are on par.I guess Bali keeps being my favourite destination becasue of pleasant surprises like this new villa estate I discovered. Great for families and from those I met, lots of newlyweds.Johannes TambuJ", "Date": "Feb 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR397549751", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jzaman"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297696-d1008418-r23431565-Gending_Kedis_Villas_Spa_Estate-Jimbaran_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1008418", "Price": "$435"}}
