IMHO, it is more a mediocre 4 star than a 5 star. The bed was a memory foam mattress and was a surprisingly comfortable sleep. The room and bathroom were very well equipped and had a jacuzzi. The hotel staff seemed to be pleasant enough, but we didn't have any reason to have to face them in a bad mood. The tram is just down the road and was incredibly convenient for 2TRY (approx 70p) We found an amazing little cafe about 5 doors down from the hotel (Gulen) where you can dine out for nothing, and 2 doors down from there, was a lovely little cafe which had lovely pastry type things (only ever seen in Turkey) Down the road in the opposite direction (on the way to the tram) there is also a lovely patisserie called Limon, which I would highly recommend.. very helpful and the cake was gorgeous. All in all, the hotel was lovely for us and I would imagine will be a great place to go in the summer as there is a lovely roof top pool and terrace.

The location is perfect for those who want to walk to sights like Topkapi, very convenient to public transportation, and we liked being further from the bridges. The hotel is very nice, it is well-kept, quiet, the breakfast abundant but not super tasty, the staff are quirky and fun, the guests upscale. We had a sumptuous massage onsite. The Lobby bar is warm, and the food very good, the coffees amazing & welcome at this time of year. We would definitely recommend the hotel, and would stay there again. There is no great food in this part of Istanbul, but we found food in Istanbul lacking in general, so our advice is to stick with the fresh fish--assuming you are prepared to pay top dollar for it. Our main issue with this hotel is communication. We booked our first reservation online, had to change the reservation, called multiple times, never got a re-confirmation, but they did have our reservation with changes upon arrival. They did not send send the airport transfer, and did not let us know this, but we half expected this to happen anyway. Our real problem was that we booked 1 night at check-out for the next week, added another night via call, called 3x to confirm, we could not get this confirmed, so had to pay a very expensive rate for the second night upon arrival...and they would not adjust the price. They tried to put us in one of the lesser rooms on the back side of the hotel, but then moved us into a fab suite. So all in all, this is Turkey, the people are friendly and interesting, they try their best to be accommodating, they have trouble with phone & email communication, but try to keep you as happy as possible. One more thing, avoid all the organized tours and meals through the concierge, you can do much better price-wise on your own.

Reception - well welcomed, cooperative, English language knowledge should be a must for a 5* hotel reception staff. Ms Tuna Emren - the customer service manager is very nice, friendly and customer need focused person. She had open ear for our constructive feedback. We have been also offered by vouchers for hamman (which we unfortunately have not used - due to the busy program) 2. Room - big, but a bit dark, the wording from the hotel's web.site \"Each room features luxurious jacuzzi and a separate shower\" is rather misleading. We got a room where the window between bathroom and room itself was cracked (this should not happen in a 5* hotel), the bath tube was not clean (in the hidden edges was quite old dirt) and did not have a bath tube plug (and once we got one, it did not fit properly, so we had to ask for another one and this could be used only manually...). The \"luxurious jacuzzi\" was extremely loud so that no proper conversation could be held... Once we started the jacuzzi the clear water turned into a bit milky water (the question is when the jacuzzi was cleaned properly; we have not used it after that experience anymore...). The towels were extremely washed out. 3. Breakfest - VERY POOR quality. No fresh fruits but apples (having mentioned this we noticed fresh fruit salat on the very last day of our 5 days stay). The orange juice with syntetic taste and coffee from the vending machine was rather disgusting. To ask for 2EUR extra charge for a fresh orange juice and fresh omelet is not acceptable in the 5* hotel. The marmalades ware also not eatable. (PLEASE take an inspiration at Naml\u00c4\u00b1 Gourmet Shop in Karak\u00c3\u00b6y where we had our breakfasts...) 4. Animal rights - Having seen the \"Blue-and-yellow Macaw (Ara ararauna)\" in the darkest corner of the -1 Floor (breakfast room) I was astonished how is that possible to keep such a beautiful parrot in a approx. 1m x 1.5m x 1.5m cage WITHOUT any possibility to fly. The poor bird is sitting in that cage for already 2! years. Please note it is a living animal not a plastic attraction!!! Please arrange for a better place of living for this parrot. 5. Location is great! Ease reachable - walking distance to major Istanbul highlights. 6. Summarised: Celal Aga Konagi Hotel is definitely NOT a 5* hotel standard.

The bath leaked over the bathroom floor and also there was no heat in the bedrooms (was broken) but a nice fake effect fire burning fireplace but no heat in it.

If in fact this is a five star hotel, then why are you charged 12 Euros for a second key. If you were planning on using the in-room Jacuzzi, be ready to purchase, yes purchase, a water stopper for 10 USD. Fancy an omelet, pay an addition 2 Euros. Things that come standard when you think of a 3, 4 or 5 star hotel are totally absent here. The cleaning service is extremely poor. Good luck getting them to change your towels or actually make the bed. The cleaning lady would straighten the sheets and pillows and then stuff the duvet between the bed and bed-side table. This hotel is much more of a hostel and far and NOT A 5-Star hotel. Because it has a spa, swimming pool and fitness center, I would not give it more than 3 stars.

My friend called down to ask how we could turn off the heat in our room (it was so hot and stuffy and we weren't comfortable) and we were told the air conditioner was broken. My friend asked when it would be fixed and she replied, \"I am not a technician, how should I know? We will send a technician.\" The technician never came and we subsiquentially found out nothing was broken, they just control the temperature in all the rooms by one central unit. Needless to say, we had a hot/stuffy room for 3 days (we were told that it is cold outside so the heat was needed!). 3.) Problem with wiring. The light switch sent the blind covering the large window between the bathroom and the beds (?? weird in itself) to open. Only one electrical outlet worked on one side of the bed. The electronic toilet did not work at all. Our electronic room key (controls the lights) would suddenly stop working causing all the lights to go off. 4.) Windows are not double-glazed so very noisy. 5.) Breakfast was average (again, not 5 star). The rooms were clean and the beds were adequate.

A few minutes later a room at the hotel magically became available for me and I was able to check in. I was shocked when I entered the room, it was drab, worn down and very depressing. My city view was a view of the dirty street below. And since when is it acceptable to put memory foam mattresses in hotel rooms. I think I would have slept better on the floor. Hardly slept all night as I was in pain from the mattress. Also the windows are not double glazed with the street outside being very noisy. At the buffet breakfast I struggled to find something mildly appealing to eat. Hotel while being located near some of the big sites is in a very undesirable location. No nice restaurants, cafes or bars nearby and it isn't really safe to walk around the neighborhood especially at night.

Excellent breakfast (wide range of cheese and other tasty all culture foods). The restaurant can offer European cuisine although, in most visited places I found different sorts of kebab. I had a refreshing sleep time and could take advantage of a health massage appointment, but had too many in my schedule for the day and couldn't go there. The fitness center is great and the special exotic showers are funny. I could have even a tour of the hotel to see all facilities they offer and can tell you there is everything I can imagine. The important thing is to be patient and wait for any of your problems to be solves. Being in a hurry does not serve anybody. And, in the end, I want to praise the bathroom.

The room cleaning remained at this standard for our stay of four nights, they also seemed unable to grasp that cleaning the bathroom is fine but the use of a toilet cleanser is often necessary The hotel boasts a number of resurants & bars all of which were unwelcoming as they were so brightly lit.

Was the hotel close to things (e.g. transport, attractions, restaurants)? About 10min walk to trams, 20min walk to sights like the Hagia Sofia. Many restaurants nearby. 2. Was the hotel in a safe area? Yes. 3. Was there much noise at night? Noise from the local mosque and busy road were quite loud at times. We had a room facing onto the main street. I'd have expected double glazing for the price of the room. 4. What was the quality and cleanliness of the hotel furniture and fittings like (e.g. bed, lock-up safe, shower)? Very elegant and romantic, mainly good quality and clean. Unfortunately some small details were ignored, such as the hot tap for the jacuzzi getting so hot you couldn't touch it without a towel to cover your hand to turn it off, and no instructions for how to convert bath to shower. Also a light in the bathroom was not working, dimming the whole place. The cleaner did not clean up or replace supplies in the tea making area. 5. Do the hotel staff provide a good service (e.g. competence, attitude, availability)? Very difficult to have room service understand my order in English (meatballs dish and a corkscrew for a bottle of wine we already had in our room). I would have thought that plenty of English speakers stayed here, and overall English seems widely spoken throughout Istanbul. After checkout we waited in the lobby for a transfer we'd arranged for ourselves. After 30mins of non-arrival i asked reception to phone to company and check it was OK for us. After calling, the receptionist said he was waiting for the company to call him back before he could know where the driver was. After another 20min waiting, and obviously no return call to reception, i returned to ask the receptionist to call the company again. This time he told me that there would be no transfer and the company had told him to flag us down a taxi instead. Although the problem with the transfer wasn't the receptionist's fault, i feel that he should have been more proactive calling them when they didn't call him back, as this wasted 20min of our time. Eventually we only just got to the airport on time. 6. What were the hotel amenities like (e.g. breakfast, restaurant, pool, bar, car parking)? Good breakfast spread, but details missed. I arrived halfway through breakfast hours to find no clean glasses, bowls or spoons available, and cereal stale. I recieved these items after requesting them. On the 2nd day there was no cold milk for cereal, despite it being the start of the breakfast hours. After requesting milk we were provided with what tasted like sour milk. I would have expected not to have to worry about these things for the price i paid. Also, pool area was unshaded - no umbrellas, and for some reason the music was turned up to 'blast' level at about 10.30am when there was only 2 of us there and i was obviously reading. 7. Did the room come with extras (e.g. minibar, TV, internet, air-con, tea making facility)? Minibar available - on the morning of our 2nd day staff visited to check if the minibar was up to date, and insisted on checking even after i said i hadn't used anything. TV reception was poor and i couldn't get an English speaking channel, although the TV guide said they were there. Tea making facilities in room not updated after the 1st day - used cups left by cleaner and tea bag not replaced. Complimentary bottle of wine bought to room by concierge, but no corkscrew available. Air con fine. 8. Other / general comments: This hotel just seems sloppy and customer service wasn't great.
