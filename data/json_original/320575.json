The room we had was small but very comfy and cozy. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is excellent, just a couple of minutes walk to the subway. and about 20 minutes walk to Tokyo Station. A taxi ride from Tokyo Station was approximately 700-800 Yen. Close to the hotel there is an excellent italian restaurant (Mario). The only disappointment is that breakfast is expensive and not included in the price. However, there are plenty of good cafe's around if you are on a budget.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR277331474", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Gianna-Richard"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Hotel In Ginza A small boutique hotel in the absolute center of Ginza, Tokyo.

The hotel staff were very friendly and the hotel was clean. The problems were that the rooms were very very small, you basically had to climb over each other to get in and out, the beds were very uncomfy, the pillows felt like there was rice in them, and to top it off the building joined to the left of the hotel was being refurbished, which they did through the day and night, so we had no sleep what so ever, the air conditioning didn't seem to blow out any cold air either and due to the work on the building next door we couldn't have the windows open. This is no way a 4* hotel, was very dissapointed. Do not stay here if you are claustraphobic.", "Date": "Apr 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR222834096", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kellyjames7"}, {"Content": "\u7f0d\u6d2a\u7c35\u9287\u0441\u4ed0\u9287\u71b4\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(19171445, 'full');", "Date": "May 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR146883881", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Une tr\u732bs bonne adresse   showReview(16592396, 'full');", "Date": "May 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR824430669", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Bon h\u4e48tel pour s\u8305jour court   showReview(16592395, 'full');", "Date": "May 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR229925959", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gerne wieder   showReview(14736571, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR989875392", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "tres bon emplacement tres mignon personnel devoue   showReview(13982472, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR294133997", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Genial gelegen   showReview(11661829, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR235292033", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Gerne wieder   showReview(11499838, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR165268984", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d320575-r22917965-Monterey_La_Soeur_Ginza-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "320575", "Price": "$190"}}
