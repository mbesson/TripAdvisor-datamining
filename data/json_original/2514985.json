I usually go with hotels I am familiar with and comfortable with, as well as the free breakfast! In this case I still wanted the free breakfast, but outside of that I was open. I plugged in my GPS and asked for a list of hotels, scrolled through and found \"Comfort Inn\", which I knew had a free breakfast. When I called, the clerk answered \"Quality Inn\". My GPS has not been uploaded for new info for a long time. I asked \"Do you have something for tonight?\", and he said yes. \"Do you serve free breakfast?\", and he said yes again. So we drove over there. There was very little to complain about. For $80.99 plus tax, we had a double with a box TV and a bath. The beds were comfortable, the TV worked, and the toilet flushed. The room was very clean, and the pool and hot tub, while I didn't use them, were observed to be clean and warm. Breakfast was served from 7:00 to 10:00. They served biscuits and gravy, do-it-yourself waffles, hard boiled eggs, assorted sweetrolls, donuts and English Muffins, dry cereal, juice and coffee. The coffee was great! There was no hot oatmeal, and that was a disappointment, but the serving area was small. The staff seemed friendly and accommodating, and they weren't very busy. In fact I doubt even half of their rooms were taken. The hotel was very quiet, and there was plenty of parking in a small lot on this Friday night. If there was anything to complain about, it was the size of the bathroom. To get to the shower we had to close the door, and closing the door meant a tight squeeze. I was also a little perturbed that the water pressure at the bathroom sink was weak. However design flaws and water saver faucets go back to senior management, not local staff. The carpeting in the dining area was bunched and wrinkled, but staff there said someone had bought the hotel and it was going to be completely rehabbed soon. From my experience, there didn't seem the need to rehab too much.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Memphis, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cDecent enough\u201d", "Author": "memphismom03", "ReviewID": "UR115184392", "Content": "Stayed here on our way to MI for our family vacation.

I hope it's helpful, and not just the ranting of a disgruntled traveler. I was traveling on business, driving from Chicago to St. Louis. About half way home I stopped to spend the night at the Comfort Inn in Champaign, IL, using Choice Privileges frequent guest points. It looked like a nice facility, as I\u2019ve come to expect from the Choice Hotels brand. When I went in to register, there was no one at the desk. There was a sign indicating that the desk clerk was away helping other guests. I understood this, and waited for him to return. I was tired and admittedly out of sorts, and was a bit sarcastic when the young man returned after about 10-15 minutes. He asked if he could help me, and I asked if he could check me in, \u201cIf it\u2019s not too much trouble.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy would it be any trouble?\u201d I replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve been waiting for over 10 minutes.\u201d He smirked, and said, \u201cI put out the sign.\u201d I explained that the sign didn\u2019t check me in, and he responded, sarcastically, that he had to wait on other guests. At this point, I asked for my credit card and ID, and said I\u2019d go elsewhere. As I said, I had a bit of an attitude myself, and take half the blame for this exchange, although I've been in a number of hotels where the staff were very courteous to me when I gave them reason not to be. That's no excuse on my part, I know. But this is not why I was so upset by this particular incident. I called Choice Privileges to see if I could cancel the reservation. The guest services representative said she would call the hotel to see if they would allow me to cancel. \u201cOr,\u201d I added, \u201cjust apologize for my delay. That\u2019s all I really want.\" She came back on the line after talking to this young gentleman, and said he\u2019d agreed to cancel the reservation. \u201cHe\u2019d rather cancel my reservation, than apologize?\u201d \u201cYes, apparently so. He sounded rather snooty to me,\u201d the guest services rep admitted. Choice Privileges ultimately took good care of me, and found me a room nearby at another hotel, and compensated me somewhat for my inconvenience. I don\u2019t know when, if ever, I\u2019ll find myself again in Champaign/Urbana, but I know I won\u2019t be staying at the Comfort Inn on Marketview.", "Date": "November 5, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Quality Inn & Suites Champaign", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g35790-d87550-Reviews-Quality_Inn_Suites_Champaign-Champaign_Illinois.html", "Price": "$72 - $89*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">305 Market View Dr</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Champaign</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">61821</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514985", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/a7/ed/3a/champaign-quality-inn.jpg"}}
