The manager was very gracious and stored our two suitcases in their baggage room a night before our check-in. The service in the restaurant was excellent. Breakfast was included in the package we had booked, and it was quite extensive and tasty, with both hot and cold items. We were happy with the free shuttle service, to and from the airport and train station. The room was modern and clean. This place would be excellent, if the beds had been more comfortable. My bed was quite hard and the mattress seemed worn, as indicated by sagging in the middle. All in all, more good than not, and it's location very close to the airport makes it perfect for grabbing morning flights, but far enough away from any noise. I'd use this place again because of the people and the location.", "Date": "Sep 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR256032896", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KayRuth"}, {"Content": "Good Hotel for Road Trip My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Novotel Nord on a recent road-trip from Italy to France. Hotel was clean, restaurant food was very good, bar was open and let us take our after-dinner drinks up to our room without hassle. Large rooms and reception area boasts comfy leather sofas and wi-fi zone. Only complaint was on our 1st night stay: room was very hot, even after we turned thermostat to 0. But the room we occupied on our return journey a week later was just right. Also, beds were more firm than we're used to.

This hotel is about a 15-20 drive from central Florence so not ideal if you want to be able to walk from the hotel to the major sites to see... however the free hotel shuttle bus from Santa Maria Novella station in the centre of Florence to the hotel is quite regular and unlike other hotels with shuttle service, you can book adhoc and they normally have enough places for the guests on the bus (from time we stayed anyway), so we did not find the location a drawback at all. We caught a train in and out of florence and we used the shuttle bus both times, I guess for those catching a plane this is also close to the airport. Hotel was generally clean and friendly staff, breakfast (included in the price of stay) is quite good with hot food, fresh fruit, desserts, cereals etc. so we found this hotel a good value overall.", "Date": "Sep 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR890347601", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "pamilya"}, {"Content": "worse hotel in the world!! the bed is a torture!

We stayed here for 1 night a couple of days ago because we wanted to be near the airport since we had an early flight from Florence airport. The hotel rooms are small and filthy. The bathroom toilet ran all night. There is only a small area for free parking otherwise you need to put your car in their lot for 8 Euro per night.

However, very badly let down by its staff - most of which appear to work from 6am to midnight every day! Hotel seems to be understaffed so, although it advertises a bar, there are no bar staff so drinks are not available, when we asked to be served a waitress was sent in from the restaurant and was extremely rude to us. The meals were very poor and some were being sent back to be properly cooked - meat was presented almost raw (and I do mean raw not just cooked in the continental style). There are no alternative restaurants in the locality. Location is poor if it is your intention to visit Florence. The free shuttle bus is a bonus but takes about 40 minutes to do the 7km one-away trip. I would not suggest driving yourself as traffic is a nightmare.

The lame excuse of the reception why they dont have a bigger or more frequent bus service was ITS TOO EXPENSIVE. Taxis to Firenze centre are a rip off 20 euros for a 10 min ride.I suggest you immediately reserve the shuttle for the whole stay in advance. Only a 18 seater. the breakfats is lousy. the bar is frequently UNSTAFFED as the bar tender goes away unexpectedlyThere are no restaurants around this industrial area. Only one pizzeria which is nearly one mile away. The receptionist sent us twice in the wrong direction. Seems you need special qualification to work in this Hotel = NASTY and Unfriendly to guests.
