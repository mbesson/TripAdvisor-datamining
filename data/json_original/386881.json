{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good trip! My husband and I stayed at The Rose Garden for 6 nights and it was in a perfect location! Close enough to the nightlife/Shinjuku stations but far enough away to be in peace from the noise of the city. Yes, the room is small but we had 6 pieces of luggage and we were comfortable (traveling musicians:) I enjoyed it and the breakfast was good enough. Coffee  fruit was really all I needed but they made fried eggs and had plenty of Western foods if you wanted. Our room was clean as a whistle! There was a coin laundry around the corner and the staff were EXTREMELY HELPFUL and spoke good English. If you book a tour have the pick up at the Hilton Tokyo in Shinjuku.....we didn't know this and walked 10 more min to another hotel when the Hilton was closer. Tip: If you are traveling through Japn and have a lot of luggage use YAMATO transportation service! EXCELLENT and cheap! We sent 4 of our pieces to the hotel from Kyoto before we arrived by Shinkansen, and it was in our room upon arrival! Whoo hoo!", "Date": "Nov 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR528800170", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "luv-2-travel-1947"}, {"Content": "Smokers paradise If you enjoy smoking  don't mind small rooms this is the hotel for you.

This review is not intended to complain about this hotel. My intention is to better prepare future potential customers so that they won't be as sad and disappointed as I was. I may have been somewhat misled by the reviews I read.This is definately a bargain hotel, very affordable and in a good location, near the Shinjuku night life and Subway/Train stations. It's more equivalent to the Days Inn in the states. Everything is satisfactory, but not luxurious by any means. Service was good, staff was friendly. Things to be mentally prepared about:- Smoke, lots of people smoke in Japan, so it's hard to avoid, but the smoke in the elevator was overwhelming and even though we had non smoking room, it still smelled like smoke. (turn on fan right when you get there and leave it on).- Stained Carpet - this may just be the room I got, but the stained carpet in the shade of red, really grossed me out.- Overall I felt like the room was not very clean.- Not much room for luggage.This is a good hotel for travelers on a budget that are not expecting much. If I had been to the Rose Garden Hotel before I booked my trip, I probably would have spent a few more dollars and stayed at another hotel nearby.", "Date": "Oct 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR898918374", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "aahua"}, {"Content": "A great decision to stay here My boyfriend and I spend 9 nights in the Hotel Rose Garden at the start of October. I spent a huge amount of time researching before we came to Japan and after a lot of surfing eventually decided on this hotel and I didn't regret the decision. Yes, the rooms are small but not ridiculously so, the bathroom was a decent size, small bath but I think this is fairly standard, extremely clean.We opted not to get breakfast, which considering the late nights we had was a good option, we would have missed it many times and lost a fair bit of money, everything in Tokyo and especially Shinjuku starts late and finishes late so we slept a lot later than other holidays.I would definitely recommend this hotel because its location is great, apart from that, its fairly basic but if you don't plan to spend a huge amount of time there its absolutely fine. Its got convience stores right by it. Free internet access in the room, we brought a laptop which was great to be able to use, the hotel provide you with the cable to connect to your laptop for a small deposit.Couple of tips! Recommend getting the N'ex and Suica card from Narita airport, you get a discount on the price from the airport by express train to Shinjuku and the suica card is like a london oyster card, you just put some money on it and bleep it as you pass through the gates, it made traveling around the city incredibily easy. We got this for the first week of our trip and then got a 1 week JR rail pass for the second week as we traveled about a bit. Went to Kyoto (fell in love with it) and Hakone.Another tip - if you have problems finding restaurants which we did a bit at the start, go to the top floor of the shopping centres, doesn't sound too romantic but we regretted not finding this out sooner!!", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR426940312", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mudwig"}, {"Content": "Perfect Location in Tokyo!!! I was very impressed with the Rose Garden Hotel. I was traveling alone and expecting a very tiny room, after having read all of the reviews. I was pleasantly suprised the room was not that bad. Im a large guy, but the bed was big and comfortable as well as the bathroom. The Location was perfect for the money I spent to stay in Tokyo. True the subway station is right across the street, but instead of paying about 200 yen to ride the subway for 30 seconds, the walk is nice and it is not far at all from the big Shinjuku station with all major JR and Subway lines. It only took me about 5 minutes on the train to Harajuku, 15 minutes to Akiharaba, Ginza, and Tokyo Station. I would recomend this hotel for travelers of any kind. Shinjuku has a great atmosphere with tons of people out at all times of the night, seems like nobody ever goes home in that city, Shinjuku especially. Single travelers or young couples would really have a great time staying in this particular area. Most of the employees spoke good english, and yes they were very helpful. The Hotel looks very nice, I think they had just renovated the place, so it was clean and the facilities looked brand new. All toiletries were also included. By the way if you venture down the street towards Shinjuku station East enterance you can find a lot of Internet cafe's. I think I only spent about 500 yen for an hour usage of the internet and free drinks were included, non alcoholic of course :(I loved this place and really love the area its in, When I return to Tokyo im going back to the Rose Garden.", "Date": "Aug 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR520612081", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SoutherncaliTrojan"}, {"Content": "Great location!       bathroom and glorious heated toilet seat", "Date": "Aug 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR130019780", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "traveler1680"}, {"Content": "Nice hotel in a good location Hotel Rose Garden Shinjuku is a very decent hotel, considering the price.The room was compact and there were indeed only Japanese programmes on television, but so be it, better to be out and about anyway.The hotel is 100 metres from the nishi-shinjuku metro station, on the red maranouchi line. Not only this, but the hotel is around 10 to 15 minutes easy walk from Shinjuku station where you can access the metro and JR line (direct from Narita Airport).Notes on Tokyo - the underground/subway/metro is easy to use with English machines for buying tickets. Daily tickets cost either 710 or 1000 Yen, depending on whether you use the extra 4 lines....not essential, but handy for certain stations, especially the Tsujiiki Markets.Overall, the Rose Garden Shinjuku is great value for money, with very polite staff and we would definitely stay there again on future trips to Tokyo.", "Date": "Jun 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR481794562", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Roymaboy"}, {"Content": "Good Hotel I stayed here for 3 nights, and was glad to have done so.30 second walk to the subway which is 1 stop from the huge Shinkiju train station.

For the price, it is definitely good value.Very well located - 30 seconds walk from Nishi Shinjuku metro station (on the Maranouchi line) and 10 min max walk from West exit of the main Shinjuku station - excellently placed for the business district - 5 min walk to big metropolitan buildings for best free view of Tokyo. Plenty shops, restaurants etc in easy reach, but out of the total mayhem around Shinjuku station.The room was slightly bigger than the average Tokyo box, and had an actual cupboard for hanging clothes rather than just 2 hangers on the wall, hair dryer, kettle, fridge, FREE internet - LAN line, trouser press and TV. I did not eat in the hotel as breakfast was not included in my room rate, but was in the restaurant for my free welcome drink the day I left, and it was packed at lunchtime with Japanese eating an excellent looking buffet, and I wished I had eaten there. Staff were fair - wonderful girl who checked me in who spent a yr in Wellington, NZ at school, so spoke great English, the day staff were less confident, but still quite helpful.I would definitely return to the hotel Rose Garden - very pleasant and attractive boutique hotel. My only complaint, which I would level at all Japanese hotels and restaurants is why on earth do they let people smoke in public places ? The hotel flobby frequently stank of smoke, and I had plenty of unpleasant dinners surrounded by smokers in restaurants. Yuk.

My wife and I were booked into this boutique hotel by Japanese acquaintances and they knew what they were doing.Just as rooms are in any world capital, the rooms are smallish but they are big enough. The bathroom was really cool! Apart from the usual high tech toilet the shower is an entire room.Don't let the simple web site of theirs fool you, this place is not plain. It is just right and it features a free breakfast buffet that is half Japanese and half western. It is very good! Actually if you watch the scene there you will notice something a bit funny: all the westerners load up on Japanese foods and all the Japanese guests go for omlets, etc.The property is immaculate and reception speaks some English.. Staff is helpful and friendly.The only down side I can think of is that as a smaller property there is no free shuttle to the Shinjuku station, unlike a nearby megaproperty. That is ok, it is conveniently located with lots of shops nearby. You can walk to the station in perhaps ten minutes. A subway entrance is just across the street, on a very useful line (it goes across Tokyo to the Tokyo railroad station).We shall return....", "Date": "Sep 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR264470939", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BobtheV"}, {"Content": "\u6434\u51a6\u4ecc\u9287\ue0a0\u4f0b\u9287\uff43\u4eb8\u9288\u5a4f\u7d12   showReview(23062965, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR472333032", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "\u9288\u55d0\u5016\u9288\u55d0\u5016\u9288?> \u9288\u55d0\u5016\u9288\u55d0\u5016\u9288?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u55d0\u4eef\u9287\u5fcb\u501e\u9287\u0441\u4eb6\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(22791807, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR136294988", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "stitch017"}, {"Content": "Perfetto   showReview(18330574, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR481937829", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "p4olon3"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d386881-r22049765-Hotel_Rose_Garden_Shinjuku-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "386881", "Price": "$128"}}
