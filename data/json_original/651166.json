We now own a week in March at The Royal Haciendas, but first owned a week in March at the Royal Sands in Cancun prior to construction of their Royal Haciendas resort here in Playa del Carmen. We love the ambiance of The Royal Haciendas, and are considering selling our lovely villa at The Royal Sands to enjoy a second week at The Royal Haciendas. The penthouse villa (upper floor) is lovely with not only great views of the resort and beach but also lovely decor in the villa. The \"suite\" portion of the villa includes the king size master bedroom, huge private bathroom, living & dining room, lovely kitchen, great patio with whirlpool and seating plus dining table and chairs. The \"lockoff\" portion is similar to a hotel room with two double beds, lovely bathroom and large closet, plus a kitchenette with refrig., microwave, plus coffee pot, and dinner + glassware to eat within the villa. The patio is small but has a great view. The resort is full of first class personnel, who will accomodate you in every way possible, and you have a personal concierge to answer questions and make arrangements when needed. This is not a resort for spring breakers, therefore, it allows couples and families the ability to fully enjoy this 5-star resort in style. Clicking on the resort info will show you the amenities included. I highly recommend this to anyone traveling to Mexico. Playa del Carmen has a European flair which is always wonderful with great restaurants and nightlife for all if on e desires, and the area is safe for those who want to experience all this area of the Mayan Riviera has to offer.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midland, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAn Oasis on the Maya Riviera\u201d", "Author": "PhilKalina", "ReviewID": "UR126523972", "Content": "We just spent our 4th week at the Royal Haciendas. Prior years, we stayed in a deluxe penthouse unit, a beachfront lock off, and most recently, a pool view suite. This resort was built in three stages and just completed a few years ago. The property is vast and it can take an hour or so to walk around all the grounds. This is certainly an upscale property, that caters to families and couples. It is close to the city of Playa del Carmen, but isolated by tracts of jungle. As you enter the property, you pass by new golf courses and golf resorts. The RH is near the end of the road, nestled on the shores of the Caribbean. The units are built around two pools, including lap pools and kiddie pools. Each of the two sections has its own pool bar/restaurant and heated public hot tubs. Children are not to be in these hot tubs without an adult, but this was not enforced. Our suite overlooked one of the hot tubs, and there was a fair amount of laughter and conversation we could hear, especially during Happy Hour (3-6PM). Still, the mood of the place was quite laid back, and you could easily find a quiet place on the beach, or in one of the several hammocks. The grounds are immaculate, and beautifully landscaped. As a photographer, I had plenty of photo opportunities. The pools are sparkling clean, heated (except the lap pools), and very well-maintained. The pools are infinity-designed, as you can look down the pool and see the Carribbean at nearly the same level. The La Palapa restaurant is the main eatery there. We just had a breakfast there once with our concierge. As others have noted, this is a weak spot of the resort, as the menu is varied, but uninspired. After a week, you easily get tired of eating there. It is beautifully positioned right near the water, and you can even choose a table outdoors, right near the beach. The other restaurant is Los Murales, an upscale seafood restaurant that we have enjoyed twice. My spouse had the coconut shrimp, which was the best I've ever tasted. I had the tuna, and it was cooked as I asked, with a pink center. The desserts are worth trying too. The murals on the walls are exceptional, and this is a very romantic place to have a nice dinner. Reservations are a must. We had a personal concierge, Arturo, who was exceptionally helpful at making our reservations, arranging our tours, and even delivering our tickets to our room. Mind you, we do not own a unit on this resort, but are members of the Royal Resorts in Cancun (Royal Islander). We were given every amenity that a resident member would be offered. There are several activities for children and adults scheduled throughout the day. This time, we preferred to be on our own. We would walk outside the resort in front, along the mangrove swamps. We saw and photographed many birds, including a pair of pygmy owls. We encourage guests to walk the beautiful beaches on the way to Playa del Carmen (about 2.5 miles). Once there, you can eat at any of the beachside clubs or restaurants. We ate at Mamitas, one year. and this year, Kool. The ceviche is exceptional. Prices can be a bit high, but you deserve the best after your trek along the beach. Venture into the city along 5th avenue for a shopping treat. The stores and eateries are diverse, and feature food and wares from all over the world, not just Mexico. Take a taxi back to the resort (about $10.00). We also went to Xcaret, which is a large eco-park that has various exhibits of native plants and animals, It also has an evening spectacular that dramatizes the history of Mexico with song and dance. It should not be missed! Puerto Morelos is a short drive north of the resort, and is a relatively untouched little town, with great restaurants and the best snorkeling on the Riviera Maya. I should mention that the units of the RH are very nice. Granite countertops, a hot tub on your balcony, upscale furnishings, etc. Maid service is offered every day except Sunday. I'm sure you can find a few negatives about the resort, but they are minor compared to the quality of the service, and superior atmosphere that has been created on this special oasis on the Riviera Maya.

We did the buffet for breakfast but took it to our room for a more laid back approach to having breakfast but the view is nice from the beach front restaurant.

It is not the best beach in the world a little bit too rocky and windy for my taste, but with so many swimming pools available is not a big deal. the big pools allowed for kids to swim and slopes progressively so that adults can swim with their kids. At times we would go with our kids to the children pools and most of the time we were there by ourselves. for people that want to go into playa del carmen take into consideration that the shuttle bus only provides service sporadically during the day and thus you have to book way in advance to get it. taking taxi will cost you around $15 dollars each way.

The service is 5 stars, the staff couldn't be any friendlier, the villas are high end, the restaurants are wonderful, the gym is among best hotel gyms and the spa is world class. Here's the issue....some of the other guests. Because this is a timeshare type resort, many other guests are owners or \"members\" and feel that they own the place. In a sense they do, but if they wanted that type of experience, they should have bought their own vacation home, and not simply a fraction of one. I couldn't help but notice how many guests, especially the 60+ crowd, exhibited the \"it's all about me\" attitude. They would stake territory at the beach at 6am, then leave for 4 or 5 hours, despite the rule that this is not allowed for more than one hour. They would insist on bringing their small children into the whirlpools although 1) it's a health hazard to small children; and 2) it's against the resort's rules. Again, all about them. Guests would complain to the gym attendant that he was late in opening the gym at 7am, although he was in fact on time and in many cases, early. And after all, it's a vacation - lighten up!! Lots of very self-centered, typical baby boomer entitlement mentality. Another experience that was astounding...the resort offers a lovely complimentary coffee service in the lobby. It's nothing major, regular and decaf coffee, sweeteners, cream, cups, etc. Mostly for those waiting for an early morning tour or departure to the airport. While waiting to get a cup myself one morning, the woman in front of me (once again in the 60+ crowd) brought her in-room coffee maker carafe and filled it, leaving the pot completely empty, nothing for me or anyone else. And she thought nothing of it. Now there are at least 2 coffee makers in every villa and coffee can be purchased at a very reasonable price in the little market near the lobby, not to mention it can be purchased from the restaurants. Either out of cheapness or laziness, she chose to fill an entire carafe of \"complimentary\" coffee, once again exhibiting the \"all about me\" behavior. I would be concerned if I owned a week or more at this resort, that these would be the guests I may end up sharing the resort with for the next 40 to 50 years. No thank you!! Again, this should not reflect on the management of the resort - they are just stuck with such selfish people as guests and unfortunately, when they try to correct such problems, they get a backlash. It's unfortunate but Royal Haciendas is a wonderful five star resort.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bolingbrook, Illinois, United States", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Hotel/TimeShare!\u201d", "Author": "Marti S", "ReviewID": "UR124575516", "Content": "My husband and I own a timeshare at the Royal Haciendas and we visit it every May (second week).

This is a timeshare property for those that aren't aware. We own a week at the Royal Sands in Cancun but had only visited for the day prior to this stay. We rented our 1 bedroom suite, master bedroom, kitchen/living room,directly from an owner via TUG-2. The resort is spacious but very easy to navigate. We loved the huge bedroom, bathroom, and deck with a jacuzzi. The weather was a little rainy so we spent more time in our unit than we planned so it was great to have the extra space. Check in was a breeze but we had an evening flight and came in after the rush. Everything was spotlessly clean and you constantly see staff cleaning outside. We purchased staples for breakfast to eat in our room at the onsite market. Prices are a little high but it's very convenient. There were many senior adults vacationing with their adult children and grandchildren. Some couples in the 40-50 age range. Overall, quieter than what we see in Cancun during our summer stays. Happy hour is held daily from 3-6pm at the pool bars. Drinks and beer are half price and free chips and salsa but make sure to get the menu to see what drinks are included. We ordered pizza twice in our room on rainy evenings when we didn't feel like venturing out and it was fast and hot. We ate a number of times at the pool grill and liked all the food we tried. We ate at La Palapa del Sol, largest restaurant on property, twice for dinner and lunch once for breakfast buffet. Service was great at every meal. Servers very personable. The breakfast buffet was priced well but could use a little better variety of foods. Lunch has a daily special that included salad bar, soup and desserts or you could order off the menu. This was a good value if you liked the entree special. Dinner had a themed buffet or again order off the menu. We aren't big buffet people so we ordered off the menu twice and food was good but basic. The resort offers free shuttles into Playa del Carmen but they fill up quickly so we only managed to use it once when someone cancelled. A round trip cab trip cost around $25 so we only ate out off property twice due to the cost and the weather not being great. The beach is nice and walkable in either direction. This isn't a great swimming beach but wasn't a big factor for us in January. People were saving beach palapas and lounge chairs at the pool but we still managed to find them most times without doing the saving game ourselves. Wifi is available but was really slow in our villa. We had better luck at the pool with our IPhones so that was fine with us. We did meet with a timeshare rep to see what was available but weren't pressured to do so. We did not buy and there were no hard feelings on either side. We didn't use the on resort travel services for any excursions because it was easy to use public transportation to get to whatever sites we wanted to see. I would definitely return to this resort in the future. I think our 19 & 21 y/o sons would prefer Cancun to this resort but for a quiet adult trip we loved it.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cfamily vacation or couples get-a-way...\u201d", "Author": "RJ_MN_01", "ReviewID": "UR124199686", "Content": "We stayed at two of the other Royal properties (2) previous times, Royal Mayan and Royal Cancun.

We loved the property it is set up so adults are not being run over by kids whereas children/teens do not feel overly confided or bored. The beaches are beautiful and great for swimming, snorkeling, or just laying out. The pools are huge and have separate areas to lap swim, lounge, or water play. The grounds are extremely well kept and as with all Royal properties we have stayed at they are constantly keeping up with maintenance. We were there over New Years and they said they were at 90+% occupancy for check in but we never felt over run with other gets or waited to anything.

The grocery on sight serves US brands along with very well priced local brands that are comparable quality. My family highly recommends this property especially after we have done a few group tours and herd form other guests at resorts their pain points (either crowded locations, poor service, over priced value).

We choose this hotel because of the price, reviews and pictures of the property. However, there were many things which set us off. 1. Beware of the \"Ocean View\"; it doesn't mean you are actually right next to the beach, but that you can had a glimpse of the ocean from your balcony. You can be right next to the lobby and will still have a slight view of the sea. 2. Junior suites actually have a two-bed configuration. No king size beds 3. We booked through Expedia; nowhere there does it say this is a time share. It wouldn't have mattered, if it wasn't due to the fact there was no shampoo and was not provided upon request. In general no amenities were provided. This should be let known in advance. 4. Picture in Expedia for the Junior Suite was actually for the king size Suite; the reception acknowledged there could be a mistake, but didn't give us a a king-size room, even though there was plenty of availability during our stay 5. In my opinion, there are not enough stairs to access the villas. You have to walk a lot in the halls. Why wouldn't they have a set of stairs per \"building section\"? 6. Page 8 of the welcoming package pretty much delivers the following message: \"we'll try our best to attend to your requests; however, don't expect us to act quick and no, you won't be subject to any form of compensation... you are pretty much on your own\". This might work for time share owners... but for guests like me? It was a little harsh and didn't like it. The same message could be delivered in a different way... or have a different welcome package overall for guests (meaning not-time-share-owners) 7.

We exchanged our timeshare through Interval for a studio unit which was more than adequate for my wife and I. The suite is the lock-off portion of the 2 bedroom villa and contained minor cooking appliances including a microwave, bar fridge, bar sink, toaster and enough dishes and cutlery for 2 people. It would have been nice to have a burner and frying pan but we easily made due. We ate all of our breakfasts in the room and enjoyed lunches at the pool bar. For dinner we ate at the beach restaurant 3 nights which was very good and the remainder of the nights went to 5th Ave in Playa. The store on-site was more than adequate and very well priced for a resort. We were assigned a concierge at check-in and received Arena who was excellent for advice and helped us the whole week. We did go to a timeshare presentation (they caught me at a good time during happy hour :0)). It was not high sales by any means but wished we would have skipped it which we have always done in the past. We attended the beach party and the taco party which were nice but not memorable as both started to have that flavour of an all inclusive which we try and do every year but also enjoy the timeshare experience. The pools and beach were great and we always looked forward to Happy Hour. As for tours etc we played golf at the course on-site. They do have clubs at the resort you can sign out for free but you should book in advance and if you are counting on a name brand set like Ping, Cobra, Nike etc you will be better off renting. My wife used the resort's clubs which were fine for her and I rented at the course as they didn't have any at the resort for me that day. The green fees were about $125 for a round before twilight which is quite reasonable and it cost $55 for the clubs which is pretty standard. The course is pretty new but is quite nice. We also rented a car one day to go see the ruins as we wanted to see a couple of them but didn't want to spend more than a day on an organized tour. (This was later reaffirmed when we passed a tour bus on the side of the road with a younger guy who had obviously enjoyed the party the night before getting sick behind the bus while the bus of about 40 people waited). The rental place on-site was very helpfull and for about $80 for the day we received a midsize car. I didn't find it that bad driving in the area with the exception that there are speed bumps everywhere that you have to watch for. The taxis and buses drive about 20 km's over the speed limit but you get used to them. We drove to Ek Balam first which was about 2.5 hours through Tulum and Coba. It had been reccomended to us by Arena to go there and we were glad we did as were able to climb the pyramid and it seemed like it wasn't as touristy (fewer buses). We then doubled back to Coba where there were a ton of buses and people but it was nice to see also. After seeing the ruins we stopped at a roadside restaurant in Coba for lunch which was really nice. Swung by Tulum on the way back to take some pictures and then back to the Royal Haciendas for dinner. We also used the fitness facility on a daily basis while we were there. It is very well equipped and we never had to wait for any equipment even during the busy time between 7:30 and 9 am. The one thing that we did notice at this resort was the pride of the staff and the actual owners of being a part of Royal Haciendas. You could tell alot of the owners new each other and were very welcoming to others. We popped into the sports bar one night and they were singing karaoke which really felt like we were at someone's house party.

Although each taxi driver has to check in and notes which room they are taking where, the taxi and hotel are not associated with eachother. So, My purse string broke in the cab and my bag was left behind. The cab driver took my purse, did not report it to lost and found. The cab driver took my wallet and charged hundreds of dollars on my credit cards to local Autozone. All my cash, cards, phone,camera, etc were gone - mid trip. It was a night mare. Even though the hotel knows exactly who our driver was, and the police had his info, they did not pursue him and nothing was done to get justice, or return my belongings.

We requested one bed but at the rate we payed, a \"B\" side is all we could get. The beds are small, (doubles), and the mattress could have been firmer for our liking. There are NO AMENITIES in the units as they are truly condos. A few bars of soap in the bathroom are all they supply. So bring your own and you won't need to meet with your \"personal concierge\" because the only thing Alan did for us was to give us our \"welcome gift\", (bathroom amenities) and invite us to meet Rigo at the taco party Tues. aft. We said hello as we enjoyed the free tacos and rum-n-cokes. Very nice, Thank You. Alan came by our cabana at the beach the next two days to remind us of the \"low key\" membership meeting with Rigo we needed to schedule. We were honest and told him we weren't interested in buying but he said that's OK, we could tell our family and friends about the opportunity. How about a discount on a couples massage or lunch? 20-30 minutes tops. OK, we'll meet and talk with Rigo. After lunch in The Palapa del Sol, (very good grouper, limited menu, especially drinks), it was off to the sales office to get the numbers. We again told Rigo we were not interested in buying any interval ownership anywhere. They tried one last offer of another week stay in the next two years, ($890 total. $250 deposit now, the rest refundable upon purchase) At this point it didn't seem to be a very low pressure presentation.

The market on sight is great with prices comparable to the places we bought supplies at in town on 5th Ave. No ice machines anywhere so $2 a big bag wasn't bad. The resort is money free so everything has to be charged to your room and then when you leave you can pay in cash or Visa/Mastercard. No Discover or Amex. A mix of spanish and english channels on TV. Friendly staff, Carlos @ the swim up bar & Hugo in The Palapa are both great. Good food, we had breakfast the first morning and a couple of dinners in The Palapa del Sol. Also take out from Palapa Express for pizza one night, Great! Last night was our 22nd Anniv. dinner in the fine dining room, Los Murales. Very good but we should have asked how much the recommended local wine cost before uncorking it. It was good but we could have gotten a nice bottle of champagne instead. The North side up the beach has a chain link fence that's falling down and needs attention. Also a funky smell coming from that area. South towards Playa del Carmen was our preferred beachcombing stroll. Don't go looking for shells in this area. What we did find were small.

Because there were 6 of us (adults) we had a 2 bedroom villa. Because we got the room for around $230 per night, it was a really affordable option for a family vacation (versus an all inclusive), especially over the holiday week when most hotels cost double. The room was amazing and very spacious- even for 6 adults. We were on the first floor of phase 1, and enjoyed being able to walk off our patio right to the beach. The whirlpools on the patios are a really nice touch and one of us enjoyed it daily. The kitchen is fully functional for cooking meals, and we took advantage of that. We bought food and beer from the Mega grocery store in Playa del Carmen, and this saved us a lot of money. Because we wanted to try some restaurants in Playa del Carmen, and we wanted to do a few days of excursions, we were glad we could find such a high quality resort that wasn't an all inclusive. Even though it is a time share, we never even got approached about purchasing. No pressure whatsoever. And while the resort was full during our stay, it is so spacious that it never felt crowded and we were always able to get beach chairs. One thing to note- this is a timeshare that operates on a Saturday-Saturday schedule. Because we were staying until Monday, we did have to switch rooms on Saturday morning. The resort moved us to the closest available room (only 3 down from our old one) and allowed us to switch at 9am because the prior reservation never showed up. It took less than an hour to move (with the help of a bellboy), and we considered it only a small inconvience. The only real problem we ever had is that the wireless is a bit unreliable, with sometimes it not working at all, but overall it wasn't a big issue for us. As mentioned in other reviews, the grounds are beautifully mainted, and the pools are gorgeous. The beach has nice sand, and lots of palappas and beach chairs. One side of the beach is more rocky, and one side more sandy. We did snorkle in the reef right off the beach and saw some decent fish and coral. As others have mentioned, the hot tubs could be hotter, and did tend to be full of kids. There really isn't much nightlife, if that is what you are looking for. Most of the nights we were pretty tired after activities or happy hour, and it was nice to just relax on the patio with some games and a Corona. We did enjoy some half price drinks at happy hour, 3-6, at the pool swimup bar that were delicous, but otherwise we didn't eat at any of the resort resaurants as they were fairly expensive. We also didn't use the resort shuttle, as we had rented a van (the resort provides free parking right outside our room). The Royal Haciendas did seem to be the closest resort to Playa del Carmen (besides Playacar) and we were glad we could get there in a short car ride. The location of Royal Haciendas really couldnt be better. 40 mins south of the airpot, 5-10 mins from Playa del Carmen, and 40 mins north of Xel-ha / Tulum. We did go to Xel-ha, Xplor, Tulum, and Akumal. All were amazing and I would highly reccommend them. Xel-ha is more of a snorkeling/drinking/relaxing day, and Xplor was more adventurous. The ziplines at Xplor were the best (and safest) I have ever been on. Most of Xplor's other activities are in caves, so I wouldn't reccomend Xplor for anyone claustrophobia. I would definitely reccommend at trip to Akumal- especially if you have your own car. It is a free beach, and you will find amazing coral and fish and sea turtles right off the beach! There is no need to pay for a snorkel trip. It is worth investing in your own snorkel equipment for a trip to the riveria maya if you like to snorkel. Best snorkeling we have ever had (compared to Jamaica, xel-ha, St Kits, barbados) and it was free. Overall, the Royal Haciendas is a great value for the beautiful spacious rooms. It is in a great locaiton to explore all the activities the Riveria Maya has to offer. The pools and beach are also great for just a day of laying in the sun and relaxing. We will definetely return to the Royal Haciendas next time we come to the riveria Maya.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cThe Royal Haciendas Resort\u201d", "Author": "John B", "ReviewID": "UR122944505", "Content": "Beautiful clean , spacious rooms .

We're a big group (17 in all) with ages ranging from 4 to 68, with teens, young adults and 40-something parents. Some of us like to sit by the pool or beach, others like more adventure, some like to cook in the condo and others like to eat out every meal. The Royal Haciendas works for all of us. The rooms are beautiful and spacious (we cooked Christmas dinner for 17 in one condo), the pools are wonderful and the beach is terrific. It is a quick cab ride to the wonderful restaurants in Playa del Carmen and various groups booked excursions (swimming with the dolphins was a favorite) through Thomas More travel, with pick up and drop off right in the Haciendas lobby! The only downside is that there is not much action at night (especially for teens and young adults) but we let them take a cab to Playa del Carmen every evening and eat and socialize on 5th Avenue. We always feel very safe, both at the resort and in Playa del Carmen.For the little ones (in our group 4 & 7), the activities are great.

We have friends who have a time-share there and were lucky enough to be invited to stay with them for a week. Although it is a time-share, we never felt like we stood out and were being targeted to purchase one. If they were doing it, it must have been very low-key. We had never been to Mexico and stayed at one of these resorts because we have always done the all-inclusive resort. Having experienced the all-inclusive, this was a much quieter alternative. There was not constant activity and by evening, when you were ready to wind down anyhow it was quiet outside. At the all-inclusive resorts, it can tend to be noisy at night with the shows going on. Since we were with our friends, we had the B suite but, of course had access to the other living quarters there as well. The kitchen in the A side is fully functional and we were able to have a few dinners in and not go out to dinner every night. However, we did have breakfast on the balcony every morning and usually lunch as well. If you are considering a stay here and you wouldn't be using both sides, I would recommend you spend the extra money and take the A side. If you are in the B side alone, if would be difficult to have any more then snacks in your room. Mexico is not inexpensive anymore. You can expect to pay the same price for drinks and meals as you do at any nice restraurant in the States. There is a \"happy hour\" that starts at 3:00 every day though where the drinks are half-price. We did experience the dining at the seafood restraurant at the hotel. It was absolutely superb in every way! The service was impeccable, food fabulous and presentation picture perfect. It happened to be my husband's birthday the night we went, and they brought out a beautiful flaming dessert compliments of the restraurant. Don't miss going there! The beach was lovely and clean. The left side of the beach is probably better for swimming. The right side of the beach has some rocks but is good for snorkeling. Do not miss walking on the beach. Come out of the hotel, turn right and just beyond the bend is the most amazing beach you will ever want. The day we walked down there, I felt like we must have just died and entered the gates of heaven. It was breathtaking! The service was great everyplace.

Everyone is always very helpful here, from the reservations staff to the wait staff at the pool, and especially the kids' club folks, whom we visit quite often, as we have a 7 year-old and a 5 year-old. A special \"shout out\" to Jorge, who kept our kids entertained during our stay and provided restaurant recommendations for the future. In addition to having a ton of activities for kids, there are also multiple activities for adults and teens and many golf course options nearby. Or, you can pull up a chair by the pool or beach and just enjoy a day in the sun. The condo-hotel rooms come with a fully-equipped kitchen. The bathroom has double sinks, but our 1-bedroom suite only had a shower, no bathtub. Laundry is on the first floor and 2 loads cost $7 USD. There is also a grocery store on premises with US brands, including half-and-half, which seems to be hard to find at the grocery stores in PDC.

The Royal Haciendas is a short distance from the town of Playa del Carmen and we drove into PDC almost every evening. We also visited Xplor and Croco Cun Zoo, but mainly hung out at The Royal's beautiful pool and beach. It was a highly preferred way to spend Thanksgiving, rather than being in the kitchen all day!

First off the weather really stunk!!! This was a week (October 15-22, 2011) where the whole area was under a tropical depression, which meant rain and more rain and cooler cloudy days where it even made it hard to use the pool unless you were a polar bear. Started raining right after our arrival Sat morning. I hope you can understand that when I write a review I include lots of details about our whole vacation. Some of this stuff will bore you, but my reasoning tells me that there are a lot of first timers out there going to Mexico that want this info. There were four of us, my brother and I and our wives, so we opted to book our own private transportation with Thomas More travel. All the Royal resorts are associated with Thomas More travel as their transportation and tour representatives. I did this in advance per the internet. Cost for all four of us was $150 US roundtrip. All we had to do was claim our baggage and proceed out the door of the terminal where all the cabs and vans were located. I had printed up a voucher to present to a Thomas More Rep. who was dressed as described in blue and yellow. Very easy to find as there were several of these reps just waiting for us. He took all of our bags and led us to an area (about 25 steps) where there were several vans waiting. He took my voucher after I signed it and gave it to a driver who loaded our bags and we were off in a matter of minutes. It\u2019s a good 40 minute ride to the R. H. Since this was our own private van my brother asked the driver if he could stop at a store for us to pick up some essentials. No problem. We got a case of beer and some bottled water and some snacks etc. and were on our way. When we arrived at the R.H. we were met at the front lobby by a hostess and a young lady (Sophia) who ended up being our concierge for the week. Everyone that checks in gets a concierge assigned to them for the time they are there. Whether you want use them is up to you. She quickly looked us up on their list of arrivals found our names and gave my brother and I a form to fill out, and then showed us the front desk where we would check in. We were able to sit down at a table with some very comfortable lounges to fill out the info. I had booked (2) 1bedroom suites through Interval International. I am not an owner at R.H. so I had traded our timeshare for one of the 1 BR suites. After I had done that at home 2 weeks later I found a getaway on Interval Int. for another exact same 1 BR and the same week, so I immediately booked it also. This was a real bargain at $237 for the week. The table we sat down at had a stack of rolled moist towels to use for cooling off, which the women thought was a really nice touch after our long journey from Cleveland, Ohio. After we filled the forms out we presented them to the clerk at the desk who was just waiting for us to check in. He was a very nice guy who joked with us the whole time throughout the sign in procedure. Since the wife and I had been to other Royal Resorts several times we were familiar with the check in process, but never the less he explained the whole process for my brother and sister-in-law. He gave us our unit keys along with a map of the resort and showed us where our units were on the map. He gave us a phone number to call once we were in our rooms so we could have our bags delivered. As we set out for our rooms our concierge saw us and offered to lead us directly to them. We had hoped our rooms would be together but ended up with a couple of units in between us. We had D324 and D328 which were located in the first phase of the resort. Once we were in our units Sophia showed us all the features including our own private Hot Tub which was located out on our balcony which overlooked the resort and also a beautiful ocean view. We could even see Cozumel out in the distance. As near as I could tell most all units should have some kind of a view of the ocean. Really nice comfortable furniture on the balcony, a table 4 chairs and a couple of extra reclining chairs with foot rests so you could really lounge if you wanted to right next to the hot tub. All granite counters in the kitchen and also in the double sink bathroom. The shower was all marble very large which my wife really liked. Sophia gave us her work number and said we could call her with any questions that should come up or to arrange any side trips that we might be interested in. Our other choice for side trips would be to stop at the Thomas More travel desk. Also she told us about the two free parties that were put on by the R.H. One on Monday and the other a Taco party on Tuesday. She also explained to us about the orientation meeting in the morning in the sales office room. This was just a general information gathering about the resort and the resort facilities. Never the less there was coffee and an excellent selection of pastries for all. It lasted less than an hour. Both parties were to be held by the pool but the rain took care of that and both were held in the sales office room also. The first included entertainment brought in from the Mayan show at Xcaret with Beer & Rum and coke along with a range of soft drinks and some snacks. The taco party offered all the Tacos you could eat with all the trimmings. Beer and soft drinks were also available. This is where Sophia introduced us to a sales manager and we thought the sales pressure was about to begin. But much to our surprise he only asked us how we came about getting our weeks reservations. Then he asked if we would meet him for breakfast in the morning at the La Palapa del Sol buffet. We hadn\u2019t tried the breakfast buffet yet so we said yes. After we unpacked we made a trip down to the market store. Here we bought some breakfast items including coffee, orange juice, eggs, cereal etc. Also we bought some soft drinks and more snacks to last us for the week. The market has a little bit of everything. Food, beverages, snacks, a complete liquor wine selection and a decent selection of drug store supplies. Wednesday morning we met with the sales manager for breakfast. During the breakfast he explained how they still had some time share weeks left to sell at the R.H. He explained the benefits to owning a week at the R.H. and the pricing. That was it! This took about 5 minutes. He said if we were interested we should contact our concierge (Sophia). The rest of the breakfast he gave us a wealth of information about Mexico and told us about his life since growing up as a kid and his good fortunes as a sales manager. The breakfast was excellent with a lot of choices. An omelet station, waffles, eggs to order, my wife even asked for Huevos Rancheros (her favorite), and the chef took her over to the kitchen and had someone make up a dish just for her. There is a free shuttle into Playa del Carmen, all you have to do is call your concierge and sign up for a departure and return time slot. The shuttles do not run at night so you must take a cab back if you stay late. A cab ride back to the resort was about $10 for the 4 of us. Playa is a typical Mexican town with lots of booths and stores selling all sorts of stuff from silver jewelry to t-shirts etc. When you purchase from these people you really need to turn on your bargaining skills. I really like to do this as I consider it just one big game. Most of the time I end up buying nothing because I have offered to little and the seller acts like he is offended. But then as you walk away if you are close to his minimum price he will follow you and try to compromise with you. They too love to play this game so don\u2019t let them try and embarrass you into agreeing on their price. As we walked the streets we also past many restaurants and open patio type bars where you can just sit by the street side and enjoy a cool drink and enjoy Mexico. Our first trip into town was to a restaurant that our concierge recommended to us as being genuine Mexican food. Since she lived in town this was a place she stopped at often for her breakfast before coming to work. It was within walking distance of where our shuttle had let us off. Name of the restaurant was La Cueva del Chango where we had a late breakfast. This was truly a great Mexican breakfast. You won\u2019t believe all the ways they can serve eggs the Mexican way. A couple of days later we went back again to sample more of this great food and we were not disappointed. Lots of different ways for Mexican omelets, crepes and also their home made plum preserves also including you guessed it my wives favorite Huevos Rancheros. After our first breakfast we walked down the street about \u00bc mile to the beach took our shoes off, and than walked along in the sand towards the pier that has the Cozumel ferry, about a quarter mile walk than back to where we met out shuttle back to the R.H. Being as we are familiar with all the Royal resorts in Cancun we made a 1 day side trip to the Royal Sands. They run a large shuttle bus from the Hacienda to the Sands on Thursday for only $9USD /person each way. We took this shuttle in the morning and spent the whole day at the Sands. We enjoyed both pools; one was a lot warmer than the other. I can\u2019t explain this. We had lunch at the restaurant pool side. More swimming and also a walk along the beach. The wall of sand that was put up when the beach was washed out a couple of years ago is now slowing flattening out, although there are still areas where it is still over 2 feet high. At the end of the day we showered and got dressed and walked over to the Hacienda Sisal for dinner. That night they were having a Mexican buffet and featured Mexican dancers as the entertainment. After words we walked back over to the Sands and got a cab back to the R.H. We couldn\u2019t take the shuttle back because it left earlier about 5pm. The cab ride was kind of expensive for the 4 of us. I can\u2019t remember exactly but it was about $50 bucks. The cabby wanted to charge us more than the rate we were given when we left our resort. So I had to get the door man at the Sands involved and than we found out all the posted cab fares at the front desk were all out of date. This is something all Royal resorts should look at and keep it up to date. It was a long wild ride back to the R. Hacienda as this cabby had his speedometer disconnected and also all the other dashboard gages were not working. So he didn\u2019t know how fast he was going and how much gas he had. He had to stop and put in a couple of extra liters. He drove like a wild maniac and in the dark and I was starting to wonder. Along the way we were stopped twice at check points by police who wanted to know where we had been and where were we going. After flashlights shined in all of our faces we were allowed to continue. But all in all it was a great day. One day the wife and I took a walk along the beach (south) towards Play del Carmen. This walk was probably the best I have ever had along a beach. The shoreline was almost flat down to the water so it made it very easy to walk. We walked about \u00be\u2018s of a mile almost into town. The sand there was very very fine and almost pure white. I couldn\u2019t believe along the way there was absolutely no debris of any kind, even though most of this shoreline is unused and just overgrown with trees and weeds. No seaweed, no tree limbs, no rocks, no dead fish, just pure white sand. The only person we saw was a fisherman checking his fishing nets and than on the way back we met another couple taking the same walk we had just taken. A couple of days later we took a walk towards Cancun (north) and this was totally different. Lots of washed up seaweed, logs and all kinds of other debris which I cannot explain. We walked about the same distance \u00be\u2019s of mile or so. Walking in this direction we passed several resorts but none were of same caliber as the R.H. We ate most of our meals at La Palapa del Sol the Royal Haciendas main restaurant.. Between the 4 of us I don\u2019t think we had a bad meal. Most of them were excellent. Salads at lunch time were very good. Dinner time we ordered mostly from the menu. I will say by the end of the week the menu was a little boring. Saturday & Sunday night we had the themed buffet, Caribbean on Sat and Mexican on Sun. Both were excellent as there were more choices then I could actually try. One night we made reservations and had dinner at Los Murales Seafood Restaurant & Bar. This is a very nice quiet restaurant where you can have a semi private meal away from all others if you choose. We all started with a specialty of the house drink. We split two appetizers and each had a main dish along with 4 deserts. The food presentation was excellent with a lot of caring detail put into each dish that was served. The four us all rated our meal as medium to medium plus, 3 on a scale of 5. My brother paid the bill so I don\u2019t know what the grand total was but a good estimate would be $250 -$275. Another night we had pizza and salads delivered to our suite for dinner. Drinks at the Rotunda bar in the evening were a little pricey $6 - $8. This bar is located just off the main lobby. As this bar is in the round it has several doorways that lead to various parts of the resort. This was the only bar open in the evening so you are sort of a captured audience. Even though this was the only bar open in the evening it closed at 10pm every night. That seemed a bit early but then there weren\u2019t many people using it. There are two halves to this resort. Each half is shaped like a horseshoe. Thus phase I and II. Each phase has a very large pool with a pool bar. Each phase also has a lap pool which is used for exercise and games like volleyball. I believe there also two kiddie pools one on each side. We didn\u2019t get to spend as much time as we would have liked at the two pool bars. The Phase I bar seemed to be more popular. But the music they played wasn\u2019t to our taste. So we tried the other pool bar in Phase II. Carlos was the bartender at this bar. The music was much more to our liking so this became our afternoon hangout. If the weather would have been co-operative we would have spent more time here. We mentioned to him that we liked the music at his bar a lot better and he smiled. Then he told us if there was anything we wanted to hear he would change it for us. One day we asked him to crank it up a little because things were quiet. Another day we asked him to turn down the volume a little. Carlos was a very active bartender flipping liquor bottles around just like Tom Cruise did in his movie. This was just a little side entertainment. On three of the mornings our wives attended a yoga class. My sister-in-law is really into this stuff so she convinced my wife to join her. She said they were really well run and very similar to those she attends at home. The wife and I will probably return on our next trip to Mexico. On our previous trips to the Cancun area we made several side trips exploring the area. This week we just wanted to veg out and just enjoy each others company as well as the resorts facilities.

The Riviera Maya is an up and coming region of the world and the people love to talk about their history. We booked 2 trips through the Thomas More desk at the resort and the tours were both bargains due to the content and guides. The resort offers a free shuttle at regular intervals into Playa del Carmen until 6:00 PM which was a valuable asset. We did not buy a unit this trip but it is definitely on our minds for the future. The sales staff is not pushy at all and very informative regarding the assets to the owners, employees, and community. Royal Resorts offers continuing education for their employees, shuttles to and from work as well as many other perks. We ate mostly at the La Palapa del Sol which was good food for the money but did not eat at either of the poolside diners. Our last dinner was at Los Murales, it was nice and the food was good but we enjoyed La Palapa del Sol more. Happy hour was used daily and there was some inconsistency of potency but it was normally stronger than weak. Alexander, at the poolside sports window in phase 2 was always a joy to joke with as well. We traveled this time without our kids but will most likely take then when we return.

The suite has a fully equiped kitchen, a dining room, a living room, and a private separate bedroom with a spacious bathroom. There are also 2 murphy beds in the living room, which is very spacious so it is not crowded at all. It also has a very large balcony with a table for 4, 2 lounge chairs, and a jacuzzi tub.

To make a long story short, be sure to check if you are paying for the suite or the bedroom. The suite we have is very nice and one of the nicest places we've ever rented in this area, so you will not be disappointed. There are a couple of negative things we have to say about this place. The property is VERY LARGE, there are only 2 restaurants on site, and you have to take a taxi to go anywhere ($10 one way). There is a free shuttle from the hotel to PDC, but you have to make reservations in advance. The service at the pool is below standard based on all of our previous stays in the Cancun/PDC area. We are used to the usual excellent service of the pool staff in Mexico; however, either there were not enough servers during our stay, or they just are not too much into customer service here. All in all, I would give a 5/5 rating to the room, a 3/5 rating to the amenities and conveniencies at the hotel, and a 3/5 to the service.

They were prepared for a hurricance, but luckily it didn't hit the coast as one. When we arrived on October 29, you couldn't even tell there had been a storm. The broken branches and flotsam were gone and the resort was spic and span. We traded our Hawaii Marriott timeshare to come to Playa Del Carmen, and I think we got the better deal. Our villa was facing the ocean in Phase I/II and it was a beautiful view. The third floor offered a terrific view of Cozumel and later in the week, the cruise ships departing on a clear night. This resort is staffed by tremendous people. the check in experience was quick and the staff were able to answer our questions or point us in the right direction. We had our own concierge, actually two, Arely and Luz and they saw to our needs and inquired about our stay often. Being a time share, we were not pressured into a presentation and that makes the stay so much more enjoyable. The villa's were of good size, over 1,000 feet with a jetted tub on the balcony, which was easily big enough for six people. Being in the C building, it was very quiet, though you could hear the ocean breaking at night. The beach was clean and maintained, the water was warm and clear. Not a bodysurfing beach, but easy to swim around and there are enough fish to make snorkeling worthwhile. The restaurants, the Palapa is mostly buffet, andthe one night we went, was asian night with teppan style cooking along with some sush rolls all worth the price. LOS MURALES, the higher end restaurant I've reviewed separately, this one is a keeper and should be a destination point for those close by. The table side prepared shrimp Caesar is a great way to get things started. I'm sorry to say I forget the Manager's name of the restaurant, but he was also terrific. He remembered us, made sure there were black napkins for those with darker clothes, (like I knew that mattered, but my wife did and she was pleased) The Rotonda bar was staffed by Leonardo and Bernardino, well chosen for this site. The happy hour was rollicking most nights and honestly, the regular price of drinks made happy hour the perfect draw. Caipirinhas were wonderful and the guys represented the resort spirit well. The one \"complaint\" we had was the drinks they served at the beach. They are high priced, low alcohol concoctions that were more reminiscent of a virgin daiquiri or colada. And we met four other people who felt the same. I'd advise that they could learn to pour from the Rotonda staff. We did bring this issue up with the beverage manager Teodoro, who gave us the opinion he was taking our issue under advisement. It was a good dialogue. The store on site was priced decently, better when you take into account what a roundtrip cab ride would cost ($24 or more with tip). We bought enough for 5 breakfasts and two lunches for $60, which is about 1/3 of what the restaurant would cost us. They had most of everything we needed, though I'd request a few more diet options. This resort is the place to go if you want to relax. It's pretty quiet, there are plenty of options for trips, sightseeing, scuba team is on site, but the hammocks also present a nice option. I'd recommend it highly and suggest you tell your friends.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cThank you Royal Haciendas...You are amazing!\u201d", "Author": "Robinann", "ReviewID": "UR120131517", "Content": "We have stayed at this resort the past four years and every visit has been fabulous! The grounds are magnificent, the setting consists of two huge courtyards surrounded by attractive low rise villas. Every villa overlooks the Caribbean and each courtyard has a huge pool with a swim up bar, a lap pool, a kiddie pool, two gigantic hot tubs and an activity desk for towels and sporting equipment. You will find dozens of hammocks to relax in the shade or scheduled activities in the pool, like aqua aerobics or pool volleyball. The beach is lovely with an area for swimming and a small reef area for snorkeling, snorkel gear is provided free of charge. Beach volleyball is offered every weekday at 3:00 which always provides for a fun afternoon. The resort offers free Kayaks for their guests as well as wave runners to rent by the hour or half hour. The activity desks has golf clubs for your use or you can rent top brand clubs as well. There is a 9 hole golf course adjoining the resort which will be an 18 hole course before too long. The dive center offers scuba excursions right off the beach. There is an activity board posted through out the resort so you can keep track of the fun things to do during your vacation. They even offer a ceramics area where you can paint a souvenir to take home and don't worry if you feel you aren't talented enough to paint. The gentleman who runs the shop is wonderful at embellishing your work and will make it look professional, if you want. Once you check into the resort you will be assigned a personal concierge who will welcome you with invitations to the orientation on Sunday morning, a welcome party on the pool deck on Sunday afternoon and a taco party typically early in the week, all free of charge. Your concierge is also always ready to help with reservations at the spa or local restaurants or give advice on things to do and see in the area. The Spa is a full service facility that is connected to the main lobby. My husband and I had a couples massage and it was a lovely experience, or if you want you can have a massage on the beach. There are two pool grills which serve food during the day, two of our favorite meals are their shrimp tacos or a grouper sandwich, prepared to your taste. There is a huge palapa which houses a restaurant facing the beach, open for breakfast, lunch or dinner with a different theme buffet every evening or you can order off the menu. They also offer a take out window with delivery to your villa if you would rather stay in for dinner. Los Murales is an elegant seafood restaurant on site but we have never eaten there, maybe next year. The resort offers a shuttle to and from town if you want to shop or try one of the hundreds of restaurants in Playa del Carmen. Unfortunately the shuttles last trip to the resort is at 6:00 PM which means you have to get a cab back to the hotel if you stay in town for dinner, fortunately cabs are plentiful, just make sure you confirm with the driver before you get in his car that the trip will cost no more than $10. We always rent a car at the airport for the week and then we have our freedom to drive to the resort and into town whenever we would like. This year Playa del Carmen and the Mexican riviera was threatened with hurricane Rina during our stay. At first we were concerned but everyone reassured us that we would be safe and they were taking precautions. We were amazed as we watched every staff member pitch in and remove or secure anything that could be blown away during the hurricane. The resort did ask us to bring our patio furniture into our room the night before the hurricane was expected to hit as a safety measure, which we did. The villas are beautiful and spacious and even bringing the lounge chairs and table and chairs inside didn't cramp our space. The day and night the storm hit was a rainy and windy experience but the next morning we woke to sun, and again every employee seemed to be there cleaning up after the storm. We were completely impressed as we watched the house cleaning staff, waiters, supervisors as well many many others carrying lounge chairs, putting up umbrellas, sweeping the mounds of sand off the pool decks and out of the pool. By 10:00am the guests started venturing outside and the resort was up and running. Thank you, Thank you Thank you everyone at the Royal Haciendas for making us feel safe and secure during hurricane Rina and for giving us back our vacation so quickly.

DONT GET THE GPS SERVICE!!!! its totally not worth it !!! There are only like 3 mayor roads !!! Tip: You have to visit Chichen Itza, Coba and Tulum archeological site. You shoul do it in one day, so you dont have to use beach days on this. Now here\u00b4s the tip. Start early, by going north towards Cancun, and then west to Chichen Itza, it will take you about 3 hours, you\u00b4ll spend like 2 hours visiting the piramids at a good pace, so the morning is gone. Then go south towards Coba. Its a one hour trip and on the site you\u00b4ll spend a little less than an hour. After this, go south-east towards Tulum. Its a one hour ride, and there you\u00b4ll see the site in one hour and a half, and spend the rest of the afternoon on the site\u00b4s beach, which feels amazing. Then you\u00b4re ready to go back and take a well deserved swim in the pool ! If you\u00b4re not a fan of the beach or prefer the beach in Cancun, you can do the circuit the other way around and end the day in Cancun shopping or on the beach. Believe me, doing this circuit, you\u00b4ll save a lot of money, time and its completely worth it ! Playa del Carmen will become mexico\u00b4s top beach spot in the near future, no doubt about it.

First, let me start by saying that we are not timeshare owners, and probably won\u2019t ever be. However, we do love the Royal Haciendas. And to us, the Haciendas represents our evolvement in travel to Mexico. When we first started going south of the border, we thought all-inclusives were the only way to go. But after the first time we went to a non all-inclusive, we almost immediately outgrew them. I\u2019m sure some of you will know what I mean when I say they definitely draw a different crowd. At the last all-inclusive we stayed at, we passed a crowd of people at the pool bar as we left for an excursion, and passed the same group in the same spot on our return about eight hours later. Nothing had changed, except for the volume of their hoots and the urine level in the pool. Here is an example of what I like about the Haciendas as opposed to your typical all-inclusive. Typical morning at an all-inclusive: Wake up, get dressed, wait for all my family to get up, take showers, get dressed, wait for my daughter while she cries because she no longer wants to wear the outfit she just put on, finally make it out of the room for our journey to the restaurant, which is quite a walk, wait in line for a table and server, then make a pig out of myself at the buffet because I\u2019ve been starving from the moment I rolled out of bed. Typical morning at the Haciendas: Wake up, shuffle into the kitchen in my boxers, start brewing a pot of my favorite Mexican coffee as I eat a banana and toast a bagel, walk out onto the patio, sip my coffee, and relax as I listen to the waves crash. My wife and kids don\u2019t want to get up yet, but that\u2019s ok, because I don\u2019t have to wait for my entire party to eat and I\u2019m already enjoying my day.. and yes, I\u2019m still in my boxers. Simply put, if I\u2019m staying somewhere for a week, I don\u2019t want to stay in a hotel room. It\u2019s just a pain to have to make a trip to a restaurant anytime I want so much as a snack. At the Haciendas, the suites are huge, the full kitchen is great, and if you don\u2019t want to make your grocery run into town the day you arrive, the onsite market is fairly reasonable and has all the basic food staples you need to see you through. And although my top priority is not to get my drink on, let\u2019s face it, we\u2019re on vacation, so it is still a priority, and the market has a decent assortment of beer, wine, and liquor to satisfy my needs. The thought of going to a grocery store in Playa to stock up for the week may be daunting for some, but trust me, at the Haciendas, it really couldn\u2019t be any easier. There is a free shuttle that drops you off within a block of a huge Publix, and if you have a cumbersome load to transport back, a taxi ride is about ten bucks. Some people may think you\u2019re saving money by staying at an all-inclusive, but I really don\u2019t find that to be true. And the convenience of having your own kitchen (with full refrigerator, oven, stove, microwave, all utensils, cookware, glasses, and even granite countertops!) is worth the price of admission to me anyway. Another thing we like about the Haciendas is its proximity to town and the availability of different food options. The shuttle will drop you off in the center of Playa, where you can easily walk to over a dozen good, reasonably priced restaurants (La Vagabundo is a good example). Or you can stay at the resort and eat at one of their restaurants or even order a pizza (which is actually pretty good). We will typically eat breakfast in the room, and either lunch or dinner. So our third meal is either by the pool, at the resort, or in town. We found the quality of food to be quite good at the resort, although we typically stick with Mexican entrees. I guess if we were staying at an all-inclusive, we would feel compelled to eat at the proverbial onsite Japanese, Italian, or Steak restaurants, but I have always found them to be subpar. Even though the Haciendas is a timeshare property, the staff is not low-pressure, they are practically no-pressure. I\u2019ve heard horror stories from others about getting hard sell, high pressure, and downright rude tactics employed by staff at other timeshare properties. But at the Haciendas, management definitely has a different philosophy and seems to understand those tactics won\u2019t win over the majority of their clientele. And although I probably won\u2019t ever be a timeshare owner, if I ever was, it would definitely be at the Haciendas. Our concierge was extremely friendly and even though he picked up on the fact that we weren\u2019t buyers, he still went out of his way to help us out and answer any questions we had throughout the week. One of the things I enjoyed most about our last trip to the Haciendas was the quality of people we met. There were middle-aged couples with young kids like us, there were younger couples, and there was an older bunch as well. There were a few people who I thought might drown in the pool due to intoxication, but so few that they were more of an amusement than an annoyance. I\u2019ve met a lot of nice people at all-inclusives before, but find that crowd a little more stand-offish, not quite as friendly, and have even experienced some anti-American sentiment from the European element who frequents them. I found everyone to be extremely friendly at the Haciendas, probably because so many people there are repeat visitors and view the place as more of a vacation home than a resort. That being said, it\u2019s not a place for everyone\u2019s taste, which is probably why I like it so much. I could go on and on about the pluses of this resort (great pools, friendly staff, good gym, nice spa, etc.), but if you like Mexico as much as we do and you haven\u2019t tried a non-inclusive, the Haciendas won\u2019t disappoint.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palmer, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cTop of the Line\u201d", "Author": "SteveSora", "ReviewID": "UR119554766", "Content": "This place is on par with the Fours Seasons Maui.

Full Disclosure-We traded our Starwood time share for this place trough Interval International (II). We were met at the reception desk by aman with a name tag that said Alvarodo. He first assigned us to a room far from the beach. When we asked him if we could be closer to the beach he saaid that II assigned the rooms. We showed him our confirmation letter from them and he assigned us a different room closer to the beach, but not the one from our confirmation letter. When he asked for a $900 dollar deposit to cover room charges for the week. When we offered our Amex card he stated that the corporation policy would not allow him to accept it. This put us in a jam as we had planned our vacation. (We had these reservations since Feb and no where was it mentioned that Amex was not aaccepted.) The next day we rode the shuttle into town to buy groceries. We took a cab back as we had frozen foods. When we arrived at the hotel with ourweeks worth of groceries we tried to borrow a luggage cart to take the groceries to our room. We were denied use of the cart and ended up carrying the groceries ourselves as none of the bellhops offered. The third day we found a used medical syringe washed up on the beach and notified one of the dive boat crew. By that time we were done with this place and couldn't wait to leave. Just to add insult to injury the elevator wasn't working when it was time for check-out.. At no time during our visit did anyone ask us if we were enjoying our trip. On a positive note our assigned consierge,Mia, was very helpful.

I have been returning every year and this was my sixth year! Feliz Anniversario Royal Haciendas!! The physical structure of the resort is so different from anything in Cancun with its tall, sometimes overpowering resorts and hotels. RH, being located in the Riviera Maya, conforms to strict environmental conditions of the area and that is evident in the low (no more than 4 stories) height of the resort. The colors are very bright and colorful and reflect a laid-back lifestyle. It is very peaceful and relaxing at any time of the day. When you turn off the highway and start down the long, winding entry road, you are entering another world. The greenery and peaceful serenity take over your senses as you pass colorful bushes and flowers. The new golf course beckons to duffers. You wonder where this road leads until suddenly you spot an enormous mass of yellow and orange. As you draw closer it becomes clear that this is your destination. Your transportation swings into a magnificent covered entryway dominated at its center by a waterfall column. You alight from your vehicle and enter the magnificent main lobby where you are greeted by the Welcome Team. Immediately you feel like family for that is what you are at any Royal Resort. The team at RH takes it a step further to ensure your arrival and sign-in are handled without a hitch. If you are new to RH you will be escorted to your villa, otherwise if you're an old timer like me you just head on up. The villas at RH are the best of any Royals. Everything conforms to the local area from the furniture to the color scheme. Your balcony overlooks one of two gorgeous plazas, gardens and pools. Cozumel calls on the horizon on any day. Fountains gurgle and there is the sweet smell of flowers in the air. Your fully equipped kitchen will delight you if you're into cooking in. The bedrooms are large, have plenty of storage space, and the most comfortable beds. The shower in the master bath is a must see!! The lock-off suite is large and has sufficient kitchen utensils for two persons. The balcony is likewise large eoungh to seat two and has two chairs and a table. From the lobby entry you proceed down a corridor to the Rotunda Bar. The business office and Los Murales restaurant flank the bar. The market was just prior to the bar and is fully stocked with everything one needs. On up to the villas. The pool areas are great and the Aqua Grills and bars offer wonderful food and great libations. The bartenders tend to remember returning members and guests every year. La Palapa restaurant offers three meals daily to include a different theme night Sunday thru Friday. The al a carte menu has greatly improved over the years thanks to Jorge, the manager. Gracias Jorge!! Los Murales is the RH's newest restaurant. A beautiful place to dine. The service is impeccable, the food fantastic, and the prices very reasonable. Not what some expect. Give it a try. The activities staff keep things moving all week with a welcome party, taco party, and plenty of pool activities like water aerobics, pool and beach volleyball. This year we were offered a tour of RH Underground. What a great experience to see how this resort is managed and run. I have a much better appreciation for everything that happens here and for how my service fee is being spent. The education classes for employees really impressed me. So...I'm a founding member of RH for 6 years and love it so much I purchased an additonal unit for week 16. Any questions? Write me. Muchas gracias Royal Haciendas por 6 annos!!

Having travelled to time-share resorts before, I wasn't expecting much quality in regards to food as we usually eat at very fine restaurants. Well...I was wrong. I was very impressed with the food at the resort. The food at the resort restuarant (Los Murales) was 5-star. My meal was comparable to a meal at any fine hotel (i.e the Ritz). The resort was also the most impressive physically on the playa coast. I walked 30 minutes in both directions on the beach and nothing even came close to the beauty if the Royal Haciendas. I will defintely go back. My only critique is for those that really love walking around in the ocean- there are some rocks in the water so you do have to watch your step in some areas.

The kitchen is a full sized kitchen that is well equipped with a dishwasher. I am comparing this to the Mayan Palace which does not have a kitchen as nice as Royal Haciendas. Bought groceries in town and only used the restaurant one night. (The restaurant was reasonably priced, but was hit or miss on the night we went.) Only thing missing for me would be a washer and dryer (although there is a laundry center on site). The AC units are really powerful and kept the rooms incredibly cool. The rooms are large and even have a nice ceiling fans in the living room and bedroom. Did not use the pools since I was looking for a quiet break which the beach provided nicely. There are plenty of huts and beach chairs for all the guests. The lifeguards were friendly and attentive making you feel safer in the waters. Ordered drinks and lunch from the beach waiters who had a nice flag system if you wanted to order from the bar or restaurant. The beach has adequate sandy spots for swimming and lots of snorkeling areas. Overall a much better beach than the Mayan Palace. The only thing that could have been a little better was the check-in and check-out process which had some confusing moments and long waits with just 2 or 3 clerks available.

We had dinner with our friends at the Palapa, the flank steak was impossible to chew. My friends cheeseburger with bacon had a single strip of bacon on it 2 inches long. My wife's Caesar salad with shrimp had mayonnaise on it instead of dressing and they used iceberg lettuce instead of romaine lettuce. It gets better: On the 23rd we decided to take a nap at 5 pm to rest up for dinner.. Our friends stayed in the second bedroom which is divided by a living room from our bedroom. We were asleep when our friend knocked on our bedroom door asking if we had a drinking glass in our room. He had gotten up and found the a women in the kitchen/living room section taking Inventory! He or we had not heard anyone knocking! She had come into the entrance for the living room. Apparently this hotel allows any staff to enter a guests room without notice to the guest, who is normally entitled to enjoy full privacy and security anywhere else in the world. Wait it gets even better: We tried to check out the evening of the 23rd, and were told that our credit card was denied!The clerk told us that we could not use his phone and had to use one at the end of the hall. When my wife called the credit card company she was upset, of course.....thinking the issue was with the credit card company. We were told that the problem was with the Royal Haciendas. When we checked in the hotel would put a \"HOLD\" of $10,500.00 pesos on our card until we checked out. Our bill was approximately $6,862.00 pesos. The Hotel now charged our card with $6,800.00 pesos WITHOUT taking the \"HOLD\" of $10,500.00 off our card!! This put us over the limit on the card by about $35.00 pesos. We asked to speak to the manager and requested that the hold of $10,500.00 be credited back to our account or that the the actual bill of $6,862.00 be deducted from the hold and the difference credited back to us. He advised us that he could not do so. We had to sign a debit slip with the actual hotel charge and were promised that the $10,500.00 would be taken off later. When I asked him why this mess was not explained to us by the clerk when first trying to check out and that we had to call our credit card company to find out what was going on, he had no answer. We are back in Cancun now where we live and still as of the 24th, no credit for the $10,500.00 hold has been made to our account.

Rudolphe was our person who wanted to talk with us about a timeshare - he was really nice & Mia asked us a couple times to meet with him beyond the introduction, but they weren't too pushy about us declining. We went in September 2011 because the ocean is warm & the crowds are slim. Less people there meant it was easier to reserve trips to town in the van and/or excursions through Thomas Moore (onsight) with very little advanced notice. We didn't get a single storm during the day (except three minutes of warm rain on my head during a snorkel trip), and none of the hurricanes were in our area. Perfect warm, humid weather that makes you want to stay near water and stay out of the jungle. Great pools with plenty of chairs. The beach was not good for swimming due to rocks and sea urchins, but we did snorkel there & hung out in one sandy spot once; otherwise go elsewhere for good beaches. The restaurants and market aren't cheap, but convenient and yummy. We went to the market at least once a day for all our needs. It's not in town so you don't want to go here if you're a young partier, but families and older couples (and younger quiet couples like us) loved it. The older couples were funny to watch having a good time, and there weren't too many kids around. The welcome party on Saturday is a must - wow the show was great! The rooms was perfect for us - two full beds which means we fit better each taking our own bed; little kitchnette with coffee maker big enough for our needs; great shower; cable tv for movies and night & a dvd player with movie rentals at the market. Central location to everything!!! It was a quick jaunt to Cozumel, Playa, Explor, and while we didn't get to it much, also close to cenotes, ruins, Cancun and Tulum.

One time they passed us by while waiting to be picked up. Oh, well, mistakes happen, right? We took a cab back to the RH for 100 pesos. No big deal. My memories are so fond, I can't even remember if there was anything else. Oh, right.

It is the only time my family can get together for some quality bonding. This place is pretty versatile. It is beautiful with soft sand, warm seas, and lush greenery. It is not built up like Cancun so you still see some wildlife and greenery. There are days when you can just lay on the beach and swim in the ocean but watch out for a few rocks though. Other days, you can dive right off the beach with the Dive Balam boat. The company has some pretty fun staff. They have different dives everyday. I even got certified a couple years ago. Although, the certification process in the States is bit more detailed and slow pace. I feel as they skipped a few things at the Haciendas that would have been valuable to learn. The process is quick though and gets you diving asap. The cenote dives are my favorite and absolutely spectacular. The free kayak rentals are great too. You can paddle out a bit a get a very nice view. There is also ample room to play tennis in their well maintained tennis courts. They have a Spa if you are into that. It's way too expensive for my tastes. More expensive than in the States. Personally, all I need is the huge hot tubs to lounge in on colder days or when the sun goes down. They even have little jacuzzis on you balcony. They also have fun classes in the mornings like Zumba and Yoga. My parents take the Spanish class. The food selection is a little limited but what they offer is fairly tasty. They have one normal restaurant, Hacienda del Sol, and a very expensive one, Los Murales. The haciendas are also close to many of the ruins and other great things like zip lining, cenote swimming, Xplor, and Xcaret. Downtown is taxi drive away, which can get annoying. It is definitely worth it to go check out though. The actual city is very quaint and fun to walk around in. There is also some real authentic Mexican food at places like El Fogon.

Grab a drink and float with your friends or family at the edge that looks out over the beach and beautiful Caribbean Sea. We love this area because there is so much to do, and yet we are comfortable \"at home\" where we relax with reading or laughing with family.

One nice thing about the resort on the northern side of Playa Del Carmen is that the commute to the airport is only about 25 minutes. Checking in was very smooth and easy. Although the Royal Haciendas is not an all-inclusive, the prices at the restaurants and bars are very reasonable. The food was always delicious and the drinks were always well-made. It's hard to find an all inclusive with both of these perks. As far as the rooms go, our suite was very comfortable, clean and well stocked with utensils, coffee maker, blender, dishwasher etc. We had picked up some breakfast items from the market in the resort and made breakfast every morning in our suite. The pools and beach are very clean, and welcoming as well. It was very nice to have a separate lap pool from the main pool so my wife and I could take a few laps and not feel as guilty about all the good food we'd been eating on vacation. We never had any problem finding a place to sit with an umbrella and the servers on the beach were very accommodating with whatever you like from the bar or grill. The other very nice advantage of the Royal Haciendas is the location to Playa Del Carmen. It is only a 115 peso, 10 minute cab ride to the city where you have access to everything. Also, the resort is a short trip to all of the local more touristy attractions, XPlor (fantastic and lots of fun btw), Xel Ha, and XCaret. We went into town each night to get dinner at the more traditional, local restaurants and was never disappointed. All in all, we were very satisfied with our short stay at Royal Haciendas. I was leery about it not being an all inclusive, but the staff is very good about itemizing and keeping thorough track of all your spending so keeping it in check is easy. Plus, since it's not an all inclusive, we didn't feel as guilty about leaving the grounds and going to Playa and XPlor for dinner and fun. Even though we chose not to take our little 17 month old son with us on this trip, I would have felt very comfortable having him stay at the Royal Haciendas. (One difference I noticed about the Royal Haciendas is that it had elevators and wheelchair ramps unlike most resorts in Mexico.) Great place and we'd stay there again.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo NY", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Vacation!\u201d", "Author": "car_and_scott", "ReviewID": "UR117097727", "Content": "We exchanged a week at the Royal Haciendas through Interval, and just returned from a wonderful and relaxing week! I don't want to be repetitive from other reviews so I will list the good, bad and give some tips to people thinking of going to RH for a vacation. Good: -Villas are huge - we had a two bedroom all to ourselves and had so much space - tons of closets, drawers, shelves, etc. -Daily cleaning service - our maid Melby was so meticulous. They say they don't clean the kitchen, but each day she washed all dishes in the dishwasher by hand. The entire resort is spotless. -Welcome party, taco party - tacos were delicious and drinks were free! -Restaurant at the pool - great food, not expensive, margaritas were STRONG! -We had dinner at Los Murales - it was fantastic. We are (admittedly) food snobs and have pretty high expectations. We were impressed by this restaurant. After appetizers, salads, wine and cocktails, entrees and strawberries flambe for dessert (highly recommend) it came to $125USD. That is less than we would have paid at a restaurant at home so we were happy! My steak was perfectly medium rare and my husband's rack of lamb was outstanding. -Loved the hot tub on the porch! Fun! -Check in was QUICK (I was worried from reading other reviews) because we weren't owners, so we went to a different area in the lobby -Thomas More is great - transfers from the airport are only to RH so you don't have to stop at a million other resorts. Also booked Xel-Ha through them - last resort to be picked up and first to be dropped off at the end of the day. -Never a problem getting a palapa at the beach, chairs at the pool, etc. And they said they were at 90% capacity - you would never have known! Very peaceful! -Shuttle to Playa - fantastic service and never had a problem getting a reservation - they say 24 hours in advance but we always did it the morning we wanted it, no issues. -Our personal concierge, Octavio, was SO nice and helpful. We didn't go through the sales pitch - he never even approached us about it until Wednesday, we were going to meet with them on Friday but had to cancel due to some issues we had with our flights that we had to straighten out. It was nice not to have any pressure! Bad/Complaints: -Our villa wasn't super clean when we checked in BUT the head maid came by to check and they came and took care of everything right away. Not a good first impression but they made up for it. -Palapa del Sol - buffet - WAY too expensive for what you get. It was prime rib night when we went but still really expensive (about $90USD for 2). Then, on the way out we saw an ala carte menu that looked way better. I recommend using that menu because the service and atmosphere (you can sit out on the patio looking at the beach/ocean) is great! -We would have loved another casual and less expensive evening option for dinner. If the pool bar was open later, that would be ideal. Even if they were open later, until 8 or 9. We ordered room service one night and it was just OK. -They offer a shopping trip to Cancun (free) for a day sponsored through Diamonds International. DO NOT take this trip! It was not worth it. The first mall in Cancun was very run-down and then we had to wait like 45 minutes after the designated time for people to all get back on the bus. We went to another shopping center which was much much nicer, had a great lunch at Taco Grill, but everything was insanely expensive so it wasn't worth it. We did complain to the resort because it was so disorganized. Maybe they will improve it! Tips: -Take a shuttle into Playa and head to the Mega. (Many suggest Wal-Mart, but Mega was an awesome experience.) We shopped for the week for breakfast items, snacks, and beer/wine. It was so much fun to figure out what was what. We recommend taking a cab back because if you don't, you have to lug groceries about 4 blocks which isn't fun. -Definitely venture into PDC for meals - we had incredible meals at Carboncito's, Ajua Maya and El 10. Decent prices, especially if you venture off 5th a bit! -When you get your bill on Friday morning, you have the option to settle everything on Friday - we did this late on Friday night after returning from PDC and then didn't have to worry about checking out on Saturday. Much easier! -The pool in phase 2 is WAY quieter for some reason, so if you want less kids, go there! -I emailed the resort prior to our stay to request an ocean front room. We didn't get it but were very close to the front of the resort in F339. It was spectacular, great view and SO quiet! Didn't hear neighbors once! We had such a fabulous week, we didn't want it to end.

First, the condos were absolutely beautiful and very spacious - ideal for families. The multiple balcony areas were very nice, although August heat and humidity meant they weren't used all that much. Second, the service at Royal Haciendas was excellent - unlike that of most all-inclusives in the area. The shaded pool bar was a nice gathering place, and it is large enough that the multiple families with kids weren't too much of a bother to us adults. We had excellent food at the restaurant on the beach, and the grouper was a huge hit to everyone who tried it. I found the prices to be reasonable, and the quality was very good. There is a daily \"theme\" buffet, but most of us passed that up to order from the menu. Nice selection too. The location is a good one, as the Haciendas are just north of Playa del Carmen, approximately 35 minutes from the Cancun airport. I rented a car, which made it easy to get to attractions such as Xel Ha and Akumal Bay, each within 40 minutes. There are nicer beaches on the Riviera Maya, but the one at the Royal Haciendas was fine. At its center is a large reef, with swimming areas to each side. There is very little wave action here, since Cozumel, which is directly east, tends to block them, but all in all it was a great place to chill with a book. By the way, the blue flag placed on your palapa brings the bar server running, so thirst is not an issue.

We made great friends with the outdoor pool bar servers. Always attentive to what we may have needed.

The resort is located just before central Playa Del Carmen, we averaged a $10 cab ride (in USD) each way and went into town each night.

I picked this place, because of its location near Playa Del Carmen (PDC), good reviews on TA, and the room size. The location did not disappoint..it is on a nice beach and 5 minutes away from PDC. We had a rental car, drove ourselves to PDC and had no problem finding parking there. We stayed in a 2 bdrm/2 bathrm, beach front villa which was very large with a full kitchen and a large balcony facing the beach. I guess we were not that impressed with this resort, because we had just stayed at Westin Lagunamar and had higher expectations. This is probably a 3 star resort. After arrival, we were in the check-in line for about 30 minutes, eventhough there were only two groups in front of us. There was a hotel staff in the lobby with free horchata and jamaica with a tip jar with \"Tips\" written on it next to the drinks, which we thought was pretty tacky. When we got to our room, we noticed a used soap bar and an empty bottle of water in one of the bedrooms. Their cleaning services definitely need improvement. There's a sign in the kitchen about a $75 cleaning charge if the kitchen is not clean and a kitchen inventory list that needs to be turned in...things that we didn't see at the Westin. Since it was late (around 10 pm) and we were all tired, we decided to order food from La Palapa restaurant. The tortilla chips were stale, the pizza was terrible, and the buffalo wings were hard and chewy and tasted like they were warmed in the microwave. After that, we decided not to eat at any of their restaurants, which is hard since there's no place to eat nearby. So if you don't have a car, you are at their mercy. We ate at the restaurants in PDC and Akumal while there. The pools were large and nice except that we noticed some reddish, foamy stuff at one corner of the pool floating on the water that looked like vomit. It's a very loud place and while on the grounds you can hear people talking on their balconies, kids screaming, and loud music coming from the rooms. There are kids everywhere, which is ok by us since we have kids of our own, but it was kind of strange seeing unsupervised kids hanging out by the pool and hammocks late at night. I would not recommend this place to couples without kids looking for a romantic getaway. The beach area is not very wide, but the water is nice, calm, and more clear than in Cancun. There are some rocky areas that can be avoided. We were not interested in attending timeshare presentations (especially at this place) or hearing about the activities and tours since we already know the area and had our daily plans/excursions in place before arriving there. They called us a couple of times to meet with our concierge for a welcome package, but didn't go and were left alone after that. Overall, this is an average place to stay for a family. It's a good base for touring the area. We went to Playa Del Carmen, Tulum, snorkling in Akumal, and ziplining at Selvatica (see separate review). I would highly recommend Carboncitos Restaurant in PDC and the brownies at Ah Cacao. We ate at La Buena Vida in Akumal. The food wasn't that great, but the beautiful location can't be beat!

We did meet with our personal concierge Lenny and Yuri on Sunday at the Welcome Party and they were both very nice and helped us plan our week of activities for 9 people including 5 childern raging from 8 to 21.

A great breakfast is the fresh pastries at the resort market--delicious and inexpensive! A couple of downsides I have to share.....the options for dining (especially at night) are pretty limited. The pool bar closes at 6, and the remaining 2 restaurants are a bit pricey, one more than the other. They do have a great take-out restaurant, which we used frequently and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. Not surprisingly, dining can be expensive here but definitely not any moreso than other resorts of this type. Also, the resort is a bit isolated--about 10 minutes from Playa Del Carmen--and seems to be fairly family-oriented. It's not a place for people who need lots of entertainment and organized activities or who like the nightlife!! Also, the way the resort is set up, most of the rooms don't have much of an ocean view.

We stayed 6/19-6/26 in a one bedroom villa... a 3rd floor unit and loved the balcony view and hot tub (the Side II had more water views than the Side I)! Used the hotel transportation to & from the airport and visits to nearby towns. We asked our driver to swing by a large local grocery store on the way to the resort (we will NOT support Wal-Mart, especially in Mexico!!). Stocked up with Mexican pastries, cheeses, puro aqua, tomatoes, jalapenos, & purchased eggs, ham, milk, juice from the grocery on-site and enjoyed our own breakfasts & some snacking every day on the patio; stunning! The restaurants and pool/beach side dining were all really good, too (yes, the shrimp tacos are a must!). In a week of eating in Playa & at the resort, we never had a bad meal, and none of us are sick (and we used a LOT of ice!). We bought dark rum & pineapple juice & coconut syrup at the resort store & made pina coladas all the time! Room service was great; we ordered a pizza, hamburger & coconut shrimp; all good too. We enjoyed 2 excursions during our stay. I HIGHLY recommend the snorkeling trip to the reef at Puerto Morelos! Fantastic clear water snorkeling. It was about $50 per person booked at the hotel. They take you on a bus to the city (15 minutes away) and you board a boat and go to 2 sites (the snorkel group was called Almost Heaven - they were great). A 2-3 hour trip; we'll do that again! Also went to Xel-Ha for a day and it was nice (all inclusive and beautiful; great for kids with zip lines etc.)... the snorkeling was OK but a bit murky. The dolphin encounter didn't look good there; we'll go to Xcaret next time & try it there. Back to the resort! The AC was ice cold! Internet & cell phones worked great. Our 12 yr old son enjoyed the game rooms and I loved painting the pottery! They had activites for kids, teens & adults all day M-F. There were a lot of multi-generational families & even babies there; the kids pools were stunning! The room was huge, super clean, lovely! The decor & hand mosaic tiling throughout the resort is beautiful. The king bed was wonderful; the fold downs in the den were a bit hard but the linens are soft & clean! The daily maid service was great... the on-site (staffed) laundry was nice, and the restaurants, food and (strong!) drinks were great too! The front desk always answers the phone on the 1st ring!! We prefer the slower pace of the Riviera Maya (over city of Cancun) and felt safe at all times... use the hotel transportation and stay on 5th Avenue for shopping in Playa; there are policia and check-points all over and you'll have a great time!!!

The only issue we had with the unit is that the 1 bedroom doesn't have a bathtub indoors. It is on the balcony. It does have a nice big shower though.

It only stops at one location, which was many blocks passed the store where we wanted to stop. We do have trouble walking, so had to take a cab back to the Mega, then in order to avoid carrying all the groceries back to the \"stop\" we took another cab back. When we returned to the resort, the bellboy got a grocery cart and brought everyhing to our villa. The bell boys and beach boys were the most helpful and yes the maid spent 2 hours a day in our rooms cleaning. Super clean. It definitely is not Cancun. I also agree with the person, I believe Augus, who said about the pressure to buy. There was not one day that our concierge did not approach us (with the excuse to be of assistance) and insist we meet with Andrew who would explain everything to us. I told her no. She insisted. This lasted for at least 45 minutes to an hour ---- every day. Also, there was a taco party scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday that week and it did rain in the morning but stopped about 12:30. The taco party was scheduled for 1:45. No notice that it was cancelled, but the worst part is that when we went inside the lobby area, there was a note on the door by the bar, \"taco party 2:00\". Too late. Three games of bingo. Really? 3 games? All the way there for 3 games. Then, the last game had 2 winners and had to pick a number for the winner. Really? Every resort we've been to has had bingo by the pool. Many empty areas that could have been used for bingo. The Palapa buffet was excellent - but costly. $35.00 each, but it was excellent. The pool bar was ok. The drinks were very good, even the happy hour drinks. The topper was when I finally told our conceriege that it was too remote and I would not consider buying there, that we were informed of a \"free\" bus trip to cancun. Free. Right. Another high pressure sales pitch from Diamonds International and you had to follow the leader into the store and meet them there to go back. I also asked our conceriege about discounts that I told were given out by bellboys, or others at the resort and I was told , Oh that's why you have to meet with Andrew. he can explain about them and we would get a free breakfast. Right. So, while the resort WAS beautify and mangnificant, it was aggravating every day to know that at some point the sales pitch would begin. We would not return to Royal Haciendas.

We had 2 units and the resort went out of their way to move our second unit closer to us so we could all be close together. The rooms are very roomy and lots of closet space. We really enjoyed the hot tub on the balcony. The pools on both sides of the resort were very similar. There were also hot tubs which I really enjoyed with warm, not hot water and kiddie pools as well. We enjoyed taking naps in the hammocks and sitting under the palapas on the beach. It was nice having our drinks and lunch delivered to us out on the beach. Since there were 9 of us we took a cab to Walmart to buy goceries. It was only 8 minutes away and 11.00 each way. We ate several of our meals at the beach front reasaurant and also at the pool Grill in the shade. The prices were a little higher than they were at the Sands. We thought the buffets were a little pricey but the kids really enjoyed the Mariachi Band at the Mexican Buffet dinner. They loved the breakfast buffet as well. We also made alot of trips to the market for ice-creams and other snacks as well as to the Bar to get the yummy carrot cake. We loved the Happy hour with the music playing and the Bananna Monkey drinks. If you have children with you, make sure you take them to the kids playroom to play. It is very nice with alot of things to do. They loved painting t-shirts and just running around and playing with the blocks and in the playhouse. They had activities for them also. They enjoyed fishing and playing soccer on the beach. They also had movies for them at night. We took the shuttle into Playa and enjoyed shopping and having dinner. It is really nice there especially after dark when it is all lit up. It was very easy to get a cab back to the resort. They even got a van so we could all ride back together. The resort was very clean and our rooms were spotless. The only complaint I would have is that they took so much time in our rooms cleaning. It was hard to give our grandson a nap. We did ask a couple of days if we could just get clean towels and have the trash emptied. Even though we loved the Royal Haciendas, we felt it was more expensive to eat there than in Cancun.

Upon arrival from Cancun Airport at 11:00 p.m. the place was deserted and we were told by the front desk that EVERYTHING closes at 10:00 p.m. We had had a long day of traveling and not being able to get some drinking water, snacks, etc. was a little frustrating. I had booked two rooms from Expedia and when we were checked in the two room were on opposite sides of the resort which was annoying. We were told we could move to a suite but it would cost $250 extra for the week. I had also booked an ocean view room on Expedia and we did not have a view of the ocean at all. The room was nice and clean and maid service did an excellent job (except for Sundays, when they do not work - not a big deal at all). The room boasted a HUGE tub/shower, a small kitchenette with a microwave, fridge, coffee maker, sink, towels and dishes, nice furnishings and a comfy bed. My only complaints are the little ants that kept coming in from outside and I would have loved to see some complimentary packets of coffee. The next morning we received a call from our \"personal concierge\" inviting us to the welcome party. Thank goodness we didn't go because I later found out it was all a big sales pitch in an attempt to sell us a time share. The personal concierge called us almost every morning at 9:00 a.m. to invite us to come to different parties or just to meet him. He managed to find us one day at the pool and \"grilled\" us for 45 minutes while were attempting to relax. I didn't like being bothered while trying to relax on vacation. The daily water aerobics classes were very fun and made you feel like you were getting some sort of exercise to burn off the calories from the drinks. The pool bar was great, the bartenders are very pleasant and accommodating - I thought the drinks prices were a little steep (unless you drank during happy hour). The food from the pool bar was excellent (we had the steak wrap, shrimp tacos, steak tacos, mahi-mahi wrap, hamburgers, steak sandwich, ceviche and nachos and all very fresh and delicious). We went to the Palapa Restaurant one evening; service was VERY slow and a limited selection on the menu. They did have a Mexican buffet that evening but was a little pricey at $30 per person. The Lapu Lapu Express was nice (it took the place of room service). We ordered a pizza one evening and on another night had the whole roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, salad and steamed veggies which were all delicious and reasonably priced. The market was great and had a nice selection - pricey though ($8.00 for a box of cereal or a bag of chips). There were morning coffee selections offered in the Rotunda (lobby) Bar that were decent and reasonably priced. We did not use the spa or the gym (would have loved to but it was an additional $8 per day) and we did not visit the seafood restaurant off the Rotunda Bar, but wish we would have, as I heard from other guests it was fabulous. The resort was always immaculate and the staff friendly and gracious. If I was to go back I would personally prefer to stay right off the 5th Avenue so we wouldn't have to pay for taxis back and forth every night at a cost of anywhere from $12 to $15 USD for a 15 minutes ride. There is a free shuttle that the resort offers but I believe the last one leaving the resort is at 4:30pm and the last one leaving 5th Avenue is at 5:30pm. Upon checkout you HAVE to be out of your room by 11:00 a.m. and they come by at 11:00 on the dot to make sure you're out. The lobby is very crowded with visitors waiting for their transportation to pick them up. We ended up just going out by the pool and grabbing a bite to eat so we would have a place to sit. I believe check-in is at 4:00 p.m. so I'm wondering why they wouldn't give you until noon to check out? All in all, it was a nice visit and I would recommend it if you're not concerned with being close to the main area of Playa.

Later that night we decided to have dinner at the Palapa Del Sol; and were offered a \"Seafood Buffet\" for a 27.00 usd per person cost however seafood was very hard to find. The problem with this timeshare is that it is somewhat far from other establishments so you are at their mercy when it comes to dinning. One the last day of our stayed we were informed that we had burned our mattress and we would be responsible for the cost; so we asked the front desk to send someone to discuss damages because we are non smokers and we did not do any damage to any mattress in our villa. Upon arrival the person sent by the front desk did not see any damage so they sent someone else to evaluate the damage. This person told us that it was not the mattress but the \"expensive polyester quilt\" which according to them if you saw it under a specific lighting you would be able to tell that it was burned. The total cost of this expensive polyester quilt would be around 39,000.00 pesos (about 390.00 usd) which he would give us a break and we could pay him 150.00 if we accepted responsibility for this damage; which under no circumstances we accepted any responsibility for any damage.

Now for the bad news, they know we are trapped on the resort grounds unless we want to get ready each evening and head to Playa del Carmen for dinner, drinks, etc...My wife and I ate in the beachfront restaurant a few nights, although excellent food, we both felt they were taking advantage of us at $27.00 per person for a dinner buffet, with equally high breakfast and lunch pricing.

We were asked by the host to see the bottles as he had to look them up on the menu to determine 'what' to charge us? he then proceed to inform us that he would charge us 50% of their price on their menu simply based on vintage and varietal? WHAT?? 5 star restaruants in Vegas dont charge more than $25 for corkage and they want to charge us 50%? I remind you of their 'non profit' claim? We decided to forego our wine and just purchase theirs, which started off our evening with a very bad taste in our mouths...the food was forgetable to say the least as they are trying to be a 5 star fine dining experience. That is not why we travel to Mexico each year, we expect good food at reasonalbe prices...the prices by the way are more than most US restaurants?

Aside from the 1 BR, there are two murphy beds in the living/dining room. Perfect if you have two kids or if you have last minute guests who don't mind sleeping in twins. The bedding is comfortable and very clean and spacious. All the units have balconies, the suites have a jacuzzi which I absolutely took advantage of. There is a grocery store on site that has literally everything (including shopping carts) if you choose to make breakfast/lunch a few days a week.

There are two phases and each has its own outdoor grill area. There is happy hour from 3 - 6. The resort also provides beach towels and there are a multitude of games for the kids, both water and in the game room, volleyball, tennis and if you golf, the property is right next door. Royal has its own beach including chairs and palapas to cover the sun. There are chairs that have been designated for the handicap. The Royal is exactly 10 minutes to Playa del Carmen, 5th Avenue where all the action is. The resort is South of Cancun. If you want to explore the Yucatan, every park is between 30 and 40 minutes. Thomas Moore is on site and arranges the excursions. Don't rent a car, its too expensive. If your adventurous, you can go to the bus terminal in Playa del Carmen. The buses are about $2 - 3 depending on where you want to go. My husband and I took the bus to Akumal, a fisherman's beach. It was beautiful. There is also a shuttle that the resort provides that you should take advantage of to take you in town. It doesn't run past 6:30 pm. You can catch a cab back to the resort for $10 US. The resort also has laundry facilities. 5th Avenue in Playa is a blast. There are a variety of restaurants from inexpensive to a bit more expensive. There are sports bars to catch the games, there is 12th avenue where all the clubs are. I can't say enough about this property. You may be asked to attend the time share presentation, you can say not thanks or give them 90 minutes of your time.

As everyone else has stated, the resort is lovely and unbelievably clean. We did an exchange through Interval International for the full 2 bedroom unit. We have stayed at two other Royal Resorts and really liked this one. I will try to give some information that others have not so as to be useful to other exchangers. We did receive the unit number that was indicated with II and it was a great room. We were on the top floor (fourth) with an ocean view to the side, looking down upon the central grounds. Because we were on the top floor, it was very private and also had the extra high ceilings. It was extremely quiet, we never once heard any neighbors around us. I never saw any insects other than an ant or two down at the beach, nor any lizards. This is a huge deal to me since I hate large bugs! Maybe it was the time of year we visted but we never saw a single cockroach (palmetto bug) anywhere we went the whole trip, which is very unusual for the tropics. We arrived around noon on Saturday and check-in was a breeze. We were directed to a special desk for exchangers but we had no wait and it went very smoothly. Our room was still being cleaned but we were given our keys and told we could go on up if we wanted to. We checked it out, then went down for lunch and drinks. By the time we finished lunch, our maid was done and we were able to settle in (around 1:30). Perfect. We were on the beach by 2:00! Everyone is assigned a personal concierge for the week. Our guy was very friendly and not too pushy about asking if we wanted to do a timeshare meeting. We politely declined and that was the end of it. He never bothered us again. Whenever we wanted to make shuttle reservations or dinner reservations in town, we just called him and he took care of it immediately. The unit has magnifying makeup mirrors in both bathrooms, which is really great for us women. The master bath has an amazing walk-in shower that is perfect, great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The jacuzzi tub on the balcony is wonderful, we used it every night. It fills up in about 5 minutes. Very romantic! We did have 2 power outages during the week but it happened during the day and did not affect us other than limiting the bar food and drink choices while the power was out. The pool bar service is great, we were served every day down on the beach, you just put up your flag and they come. The happy hour drinks were good and huge! My favorites were the mango daquiris and the mojitos. Cost was only about $5.00 for a grande during happy hour. They also gave you free chips and salsa with your drinks during happy hour and the salsa was great. We found the service all week long to be outstanding wherever we went, on resort and off. There was no delay ever for anything. The kitchen is well stocked and even has a non-stick pan for cooking eggs. There is no garbage disposal in the sink, which we found irritating and they do not provide paper towels or liquid dish soap for any hand washing of dishes. You can easily buy these at the on-site market. However, we had daily maid service which was great, she did a fantastic job, she even washes out your shower every day. We tipped $5 a day to the maid, she does more than just change your towels. Also, they provide free wi-fi in the units which is a huge benefit for me as I have to check in for work periodically since I am self-employed. The internet connection worked fine the whole week. The on-site market had everything we needed to make breakfasts and lunches for the week, plus make cocktails. It was not terribly expensive and we were very happy not to have to make a trip into Playa to get get groceries. It is very well stocked. For the convenience and time saving alone, I recommend just using their market. We never had a problem getting a palapa and chairs at the beach all week, in fact we got a front row one everyday and the earliest we ever went down was 10:30. The pool chairs do fill up fast but we are beach people so we only went to the pool at the end of the day, if at all. The sand is beautiful, white and powder soft and it never gets hot. We stayed in Phase 1 and having checked out the whole beach down both sides quite a ways, I have to say that the Phase 1 beach is by far the best spot. The water is calm and crystal clear. Yes, there are alot of rocky areas but there are also 2 large sandy areas where you can walk out a very long way in clear shallow water. The water in front of Phase 2 is murky and much rougher with seaweed. I would not have been happy with the beach if that had been our only choice. As you walk even further north on the beach the water is even murkier and full of seaweed and seagrass. The beach going south toward Playa is very rocky in the water. So the best spot is dead central in front of Phase 1. We did try snorkeling out here but when we out it was so shallow over the rocks and coral that I cut my knee so we did not go out again. We did spent an entire day snorkeling down in Akumal at Yal-Ku Lagoon and Akumal Bay and that was excellent. We saw a giant turtle, must have been 5 ft. long in Akumal Bay. We hired a taxi driver for the day for $100 and he took us to each place and stayed until we wanted to go to the next place. I won't go into all the places we ate in Playa other than to mention that you must go to Alux Restaurant. It was closed for a few months but is open again and it is amazing. It is inside a dried cenote/caverns and was really fascinating. The food was fine, not great but not terrible, actually the filet mignons were excellent. But go because it is a setting you won't believe. After our dinner, our waiter took us for a private tour through the caverns and it is just beautiful. We had an amazing trip and loved everything about it. The weather was perfect all week, not a drop of rain and was in the 80's, although by the last day you could feel it getting hotter and more humid than the whole week had been. We will definitely be going back some day!", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockford, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Condo Resort on the Beach and Near Playa del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "sharney29", "ReviewID": "UR107424095", "Content": "My sister and I stayed at The Royal Haciendas (TRH) in Playa del Carmen (PDC) for the week of April 16-23, 2011 (week before Easter). We booked with them over Expedia and chose the resort after seeing what was included and the age requirement for making a reservation is 25. We weren\u2019t interested in crazy spring break partying. Most of the travelers were older couples whose kids are grown or families with young kids. There weren\u2019t many couples, and we were definitely the only two single travelers together. The resort is so large that you don\u2019t get the feeling there are many people there, although many of the rooms were booked. I had read somewhere that the staff might not be that helpful because of the property being condos for buying rather than a hotel. I found quite the opposite. Everyone seemed even more hospitable, interested in our stay, and extremely helpful. The resort is enormous and beautiful. All of the villas, landscaping, grounds, pools, shops, etc. are very well cared for. There are two sides to the resort, and both sides are surrounded by the rooms (they call them villas). Each side of the resort has one lap pool, a child\u2019s pool that is 1.5 feet deep, a larger pool (about 4 feet deep) with the swim up bar, and a hot tub. There is also a gym, rec room, tennis court on top of the hotel, bar/pool area inside the hotel (The Rotunda), fancier restaurant (Los Murales), and then the main restaurant (La Palapa) that has a nice menu, buffet, and express/take-out option. Each of the main pools also has a bar/restaurant with seating. There are also sports desks and towel desks for both sides. The sports desks have the scuba tours through Dive Balam (closed on Saturdays), with instructors and equipment. The towel desk offers towels whenever and is open from about 7:30am to 10:30pm. For everything you do at the resort (eat, shop, use towels, etc.), you will be asked to give your villa number. All charges are made to the total room bill and paid at the end of the stay, except for tips. You will receive your final bill the morning the day before you leave, and can pay it that day making check-out easier. After you pay the bill, you can then use credit card or cash. For the towel desk, they will run your card and then keep the white/yellow copies of the charge slip. When you return the towel, they give you the yellow copy for your records. You can check-out and return towels as often as needed. On each side of the resort are lifeguard stations to watch the beach, flags indicating the level of caution for swimming, and beach chairs with umbrellas. The chairs and umbrellas are available for anyone. They just ask you do not leave you stuff for hours at a time and prevent others from using them. Later in the morning or afternoon, a hostess will give each group a flag to indicate if you need food or drink service, and she will wait on you at the beach. The waves were pretty rough most of the day when we were there, and the flags generally alternated between yellow and red. The lifeguards and beach monitors keep a close eye on the guests to keep everyone out of the water when the flags are red, and especially as night falls. There are a couple of smaller spaces off the beach for swimming, but otherwise the beach has a lot of rocky areas. Don\u2019t let that deter you from visiting, though, because you can walk around the bend to the south toward the Grand Coral and find very wide shallows for great swimming (soft sands, brilliant clear water, no rocks or coral, etc.). We only saw the Grand Coral from the beach, but it seems to be much smaller, less developed or progressing, and maybe condos? There wasn\u2019t much to it, and there were very few people which made for great enjoyment for us. From TRH beach, you can see Cozumel in the distance and approaching cruise ships. You can\u2019t make out the size of the island, but can see the taller buildings. We booked the junior suite, which is the smaller side of the villa. The floors are all tiled, the walk-in bath/shower is tile, there is a separate dressing area with a double vanity; small kitchenette area with a sink, microwave, refrigerator, basic dishes, and toaster; two double beds, small desk and chair, another small table by the terrace/balcony, large armoire with the TV and drawers, and excellent closet space. Within the closet was the large ironing board and iron, hangers, storage above and below, and a closet safe. We were on the first floor, and therefore had a small terrace that was accessed through sliding doors. There were two chairs and a small table outside to view the resort. The resort has free WiFi, and you will be given the code when you check in. We had no problem using it, and were even able to access it with just my sister\u2019s ipod (not an iphone). We took the Thomas More transportation shuttle (housed within the resort and other hotels; more comment elsewhere regarding tours). You can Google their website and call/email them directly to set up the transportation. The shuttle will be billed to you room, so you don\u2019t need any money on hand to pay except for tips. We were warned by other travelers online that when you arrive at Cancun airport many people will try to stop you to provide you transportation. The voucher emailed to me in confirmation explained what the Thomas More would be wearing to help differentiate them. Pay close attention to what they say to look for and make sure to leave the airport. If someone stops you while you are still inside, they are not from Thomas More. The Thomas More staff was located just outside the doors (this is after you get your passport stamped, get your luggage, and go through security again for customs). They were wearing short-sleeved dress shirts in bright yellow, with navy pants. You show them your voucher and they hook you up with the shuttle and other parties you\u2019re scheduled with. They will place luggage stickers on each piece and give you copies to claim later from the bellboys at the resort. The shuttle runs every 45 minutes between the hours of about 7am and 7pm, although you should check the times when you are there. The shuttle you arrange only transports between the Cancun airport and The Royal Haciendas (TRH), which means once your shuttle has your party and the other parties scheduled on that shuttle, you go directly to the resort. You will be asked to schedule your return transportation the day before you take your return flight. You can do that at the Thomas More desk in the resort. When you arrive to The Royal Haciendas, it\u2019s a ways back into the arid jungle/brush, near other major hotels (although you can\u2019t see them from the resort). We often entered at the same entrance as Grand Coral and there are signs for others. The trip from the Cancun airport is partially on highway and partially through town. TRH is not located in the downtown of Playa del Carmen (PDC), but is right on the beach. (More on getting downtown later.) The front entry is bustling with transportation going in and out, and bellboys. The bellboys will hook all of your luggage going to your room together and deliver it to your room once you\u2019ve checked in and you call them for it to be delivered. At check-in, the staff provided a book that guides to all of the resorts amenities and gives recommendations for tips. A map was given, with the villa number. In the lobby, is the Thomas More travel agency through which you can book the airport shuttle or tours to local ruins, cenotes, towns, excursions, etc. There is an ATM in the lobby that dispenses U.S. dollars for a charge of 60 pesos. The front desk will exchange U.S. dollars into pesos. There is a daily limit on the exchange (maybe $300/day USD) and the week (maybe $1,500 USD). They typically dispense the larger bills of pesos, so you may want to ask for smaller bills. At the time of our trip, the exchange range was about 11-12 pesos per dollar. They were giving 100 peso bills, which meant initially our smallest bills were $10 USD. Some of the local vendors in town and on the excursions may haggle that they cannot make change if they see you only have a larger bill. The smaller bills ($50 pesos and $20 pesos) are useful for tipping. Also off the lobby, are the spa, market, Rotunda bar, Los Murales restaurant, membership area, and a schedule of activities. We did not visit the spa, Rotunda bar, or Los Murales, so I can\u2019t comment on the services or costs. Los Murales does have the menu posted outside the restaurant, so you are able to check the menu and costs before going inside. The market is a mini-grocery store that offers the basic for all meals (breakfast, fresh fruit and vegetables, frozen meals, juice, soda, milk), snacks, desserts, liquor, souvenirs, a small pharmacy, pool toys, flip-flops, etc. The market is open from about 7:30am until about 10:30pm. Prices are in pesos. Many of the brands are native to Mexico, although some are U.S. brands in Spanish packaging. The prices on Mexican vanilla and honey are reasonable, and better than most of the shops we visited in downtown Playa del Carmen. The honey is real bee honey, and the Yucatan is supposed to have some of the best honey because of the type of bees. Either way, it was better than what we often find on shelves here (most often clover honey) and far less expensive than our pure bee honey. The membership area is where you might meet with the personal host and concierge assigned to you. You will receive cards, notes, and phone calls to join them for welcome parties, taco parties, breakfast, etc. If you choose to visit with them, you\u2019ll hear about the company that owns TRH and your opportunities to become an owner in the property. We did not attend the parties, although we tried to be polite and decline. We booked through Expedia, and were not interested in time share opportunities. You may need to call/visit the membership desk if you want to book a shuttle into the downtown of Playa del Carmen that is at a time not run by the front desk. The other thing that is at the hotel in the middle is a selection of souvenir merchants. They offer many of the same handicraft and jewelry choices as you\u2019ll see in downtown, so you would be better off to wait and see what else you find. They will tell you they are only there for that day, but will magically reappear the next day and thereafter. Transportation to Playa del Carmen is offered free of charge through the hotel. It is generally provided by taxis the hotel calls and organizes around a schedule. (There are many taxis that stay on hand on the property just around the corner from the entrance. They are readily available as soon as you get to the front steps by the lobby. The front steps staff will call the taxi and set up the transportation for you at that moment. You do not need to schedule ahead.). The first taxi going into PDC is at 10:15 and the last is at 6:30. The last return taxi from PDC to TRH is at 6:00. When you check in, they will give you a schedule, along with the limits on how many people can go at a time. If you want to go in the evening, book early. We went out on the last Friday night, and they had four vans going. The limit was 40 people, and they were booked. The taxis are white with sea green strip on them. They are clearly marked as taxis and have the numbers on the back. TRH staff keeps a close eye on which travelers get into which taxi, and will keep track of the taxi you bring back. This is true for the shuttle if you set it up, or if you book a taxi separately. You can arrange a taxi to many of the local hotels, towns, and excursions. The front steps staff has a table with the estimated costs for those trips. If you want to go into/leave PDC at time that isn\u2019t offered on the shuttles, the cost is about $12USD plus tip. The shuttle drops off and picks up at the same spot near 5th Avenue (the main street for food and shopping). It\u2019s at the same area where the taxis congregate, so they\u2019re easy to find if you choose to go it without the shuttle. There are many warnings on other sights online to be wary of taxis and be sure you take one marked correctly. We were very fortunate with our drivers. They were all courteous and helpful with local recommendations. Most were able to speak basic English and understood our even more basic Spanish.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eagan, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing, clean, well maintained, with choices\u201d", "Author": "jalec1962", "ReviewID": "UR105326582", "Content": "My family just returned from the Royal Haciendas resort.

Recommend getting the food in town the first day, but you can get everything you need at the local market, at a bit higher price. The mini kitchen was nicely outfitted, but prepare yourself by getting a cartload of groceries in town and save the $150 extra. The food at the beach side restaurant was average at best, perhaps a 5-6 out of 10. Never tried the buffet, as it was too little for too much money. The lime soup was good but they need more choice in salads. My daughter became ill from food once. The poolside bar guacamole is great, and the drinks were good as well. All staff was courteous, well mannered, helpful, and worked with our very limited Spanish to reach understanding. There were enough social activities to complete and choose from. The surf was posted red or yellow the entire time we were there but we still had plenty to do. Having free internet was very nice, but at reduced capacity. Hotel shuttle capacity to downtown Playa was limited and the staff was reluctant to order more unless demanded. Be prepared to be offered several time-share breakfasts from your 'personal concierge'; we were able to dodge them relatively easily though. There is no night life at the resort, which we appreciated. If we needed to do something, Playa is 10 minutes away. NO SPRING BREAKERS is the rule, and they enforce it well. The evenings on the deck were peaceful and quiet. We did not have enough time to do everything we wanted. Be warned, the resort operates on Mexico time; everything is 10-15 minutes (or more) late. My wife and daughter completed their open water diving training the week before and were working to complete their open water certifications and I was able to go diving six times. The Dive Balaam shop is staffed with wonderful people; Aurora, Gabby, Carlos, Marcos, Christian and 'Ricco'. The dives were fun, enjoyable, relaxing, and I can\u2019t even estimate how many different species of marine life we saw. Drift dives are a lot of fun. Don't golf at the Grand Coral, just in front of the resort, until about the middle of May, when they expect to have it finished, and even then ask how many holes are open. There are only 9 holes available right now. It will be nice, but too broken up right now. The resort has an arrangement with the Mayakoba golf resort, which is half price Monday morning.

The villa was perfect for our family. My wife and I has a spacious king bedroom and our three girls stayed in the living area. The two older girls slept in the clever murphy beds that pulled out of the entertainment center and a crib was brought up for our two-year-old. The food at the pool bar for lunches or early dinner was very tasty. Tacos and wraps were our favorites. Drinks were very tasty. We ate at the Italian night in the beach side restaurant. We would not recommend this. We went into Playa a couple of times to shop for groceries to have in our villa. The on-site store was a bit expensive but very convenient and had an excellent selection of snacks and food for meals. The staff at Royal Haciendas was exceptional. Very welcoming, courteous, and seemed genuinely interested in our comfort. Octavio, our personal concierge, checked in with us several times over the course of the week to make sure we were enjoying our stay and to see if we needed anything. Other reviewers have mentioned that the personal concierges are only there to sell timeshare space. I would have to disagree. I had one conversation with Octavio about timeshares and rentals and felt no pressure whatsoever. He gave me the information I wanted and answered my questions with honesty. The common pool was a perfect blend of shallow areas for our younger daughter and deeper water for our older swimmers. It was windy for most of our stay so we didn't spend much time on the beach. However, the beach area was clean and the water warm. If one is looking for a party place or rowdy spring break trip, Royal Haciendas is not the place. Our stay was very laid back and relaxing. Activity really quieted down after dinner time which allowed my wife and I to have some relaxing time on the patio after our girls were asleep.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cLovely and Clean, but the Salepeople (aka concierges) went too far this time\u201d", "Author": "bethy424", "ReviewID": "UR102677345", "Content": "We are owners at the Royal Sands and decided to take a second trip this year to the Royal Haciendas for a change in scenery. Plus our kids just adore the gentler surf and the whirlpools on the balconies. We rented through the Royal Resorts rental program. This resort has outstanding faciilities. The tilework is breathtaking. The maids keep the villas spotless. The maintenance team works nonstop to keep the resort sparkling clean. We would recommend this resort to anyone who would like a quiet, relaxing, comfortable week at a Carribbean beach. And our weather was stunning. All that said, we are going to Hawaii next year. Even if we can't rent out our Royal Sands week - we'll just take the loss. Part of it is that we honestly are probably just ready for a change of scenery and a little dose of a different culture. But the other reason is that we need a break from the salespeople (aka concierges). I am totally burned out on dealing with them. We are already Royals owners and own a couple other quality timeshares as well. I think maybe this makes us a desirable target for the sales team but the truth is, we are HIGHLY informed timeshare owners and users and know exactly what we do and don't want to buy. We have the perfect TS portfolio to meet our family's vacation needs. We also do non-TS travel (imagine that!) We stated all this politely to our concierge during week 0 at the very beginning. But he was way too aggressive. He knocked on our door too many times. Once when I answered the door for room service (in my robe) he was standing there, too and would not go away so I could get dressed and serve my family their food while it was hot. He tracked us down at the beach, etc. He patronizingly lectured me (a woman) about how we MUST meet with our contact (his superior) at the Royals during every visit just to \"maintain the relationship\" and that doing so had nothing to do with promoting sales. I am not an idiot. Finally, when all else failed he and a woman concierge stalked me ( I could see them watching me as I moved around) at a resort activity/event and then approached me so she could give me the same spiel in a softer, less aggressive tone. Ugh. I just sort of sick to my stomach all week having to deal with this. I totally understand and sympathize that these folks are just trying to make a living and support their families in an increasingly precarious tourism environment in Mexico. But scaring guests (and owners!) away and making them not want to return is not the way to keep the pipeline open!

Only a few minor details keeping this from achieving a \"10\"\u201d", "Author": "chibuilder", "ReviewID": "UR102651740", "Content": "Royal Haciendas is a truly beautiful resort. We had a great week in Playa del Carmen (3/26 \u2013 4/2/11) and would love to go back. As others have said, the resort is kept VERY clean and the location is exceptional. We stayed in unit G447 which was a penthouse unit near the lobby in the Phase 2 section of the resort with a great view over the pools, hammocks, and out towards the beach and ocean. This location proved to be very good for our family as we loved the morning sun, the great views over the resort and liked the upper floor location. As a penthouse, this unit was one of the Deluxe Villa layouts (as opposed to the normal flexivilla plan) which meant we benefitted from an extended size master bedroom with a sitting area and very tall, vaulted ceilings in each bedroom and the living room. We had friends travelling with us that stayed in the 1br suite portion of G354 which is also in phase 2 with very good views but because it is on the 3rd floor is not a deluxe villa plan and was missing the vaulted ceilings and extra sitting area in the MBR. Even so, it was more than adequate and very nice. We thought the pool and poolside restaurant were superior on the Phase 2 side of the resort but the beach was better on the Phase 1 side. It was always easy to find some pool chairs and there seemed to be plenty of palapas out on the beach. As others have noted the villas are very clean, well-laid out and nicely furnished. They have full kitchens with stovetop and oven (an actual oven is rare in Mexico), plus microwave and dishwasher. Granite counters in the kitchen and both baths are all very nice. The tile work throughout the villa and especially in the showers is very nice and upscale. Tile floors throughout and a nice whirlpool tub on the balcony. Keep in mind that due to the tropical climate, if you open your patio doors and don\u2019t turn down the AC, your floors will collect condensation and that will quickly turn them from beautiful tiled floors to basically a hard-surfaced slip n slide. There are only a few things that, in my mind, keep this from being a true \u201c10.\u201d For reference, I consider the Four Seasons Residence Club at Aviara to be a \u201c10\u201d so have admittedly very high standards. These minor flaws include the lack of in-unit laundry (there is a central laundry at the resort but no machines in the actual units), no automatic ice-maker in the fridge/freezer (seems like a petty oversight given the otherwise top notch kitchen, no maid service on Sunday (or Mexican holidays) vs. 7 day service at a truly luxurious resort, a somewhat mediocre spa experience (one might chalk it up to the therapist\u2026not the resort/spa), the staff is generally accommodating but not quite world class like you might experience at a Four Seasons resort (though they do try and some are excellent\u2026.others are still learning and I know that even a resort representative mentioned this as a continuing point of learning for their staff), and the resort shuttle to/from Playa del Carmen is very limited in times and capacity and not so easy to reserve. There is a strong taxi union in the area and the Royal Resorts Shuttle has a very limited schedule and must be reserved a day in advance. Since the resort is in Mexico and renting a car isn\u2019t always comfortable for travelers in a foreign country, I view a robust shuttle as essential and don\u2019t see how a taxi union could gripe about a private property servicing its members only. Several days during our stay, we were unable to reserve space on the shuttle. There are plenty of cabs, and the cost is approximately $23 round trip (for 4 people). None of these things will keep you from having a great trip and the resort is truly very nice but these items are what separate the 10\u2019s from the 9.5\u2019s in my mind. Each guest is assigned a personal concierge. Nice, but my personal preference is a staffed concierge desk with people available all the time (our personal concierge was there during the days but not in the evenings). The pools were great. Everyone in our family loved the hammocks scattered throughout the resort under various palapas and the beach is fantastic (though I recommend water shoes in the ocean as there are several rocks under the sand. The breakfast buffet was also very good and a decent value if one takes advantage of the early-bird deal (from 7am \u2013 8:45am). Lunch at the two poolside restaurants was ok. Not great, but very passable for a poolside respite. Happy hour is from 3-6pm each day at the pool/beach and the drink selection was good and reasonably priced. Happy Hour then moves inside to the lobby bar (Rotunda bar) from 6-9pm. The onsite market is definitely adequate but we always enjoy visiting the local grocery. There are also some very nice restaurants in Playa del Carmen. We particularly enjoyed Tacqueria El Fogon (across from the MEGA) and Madre y Tierra (on 5th Avenue). We ate at El Fogon 2x and our final meal was at Madre Tierra and it was clearly the best meal we had (and they had a GREAT kids menu). We also ate at Wicky\u2019s on the beach which was very nice but also VERY expensive. I\u2019d skip Wicky\u2019s in favor of Madre y Tierra. The spa is pretty nice but cramped into a mostly-lower level space. My wife enjoyed her massage in the spa and I had a beach-front massage that I would very clearly say was mediocre at best. It was supposed to be deep tissue but when asked about the pressure, I replied that I preferred deep tissue and was told that \u201cthis is for relaxation only\u201d and the therapist continued with a more traditional Swedish touch massage --- Overpriced and less than satisfactory but not enough to ruin a vacation. Our kids enjoyed the t-shirt painting and ceramics at the activity center, too. My kids really love their new t-shirts (not sure how to wash them, but they are very nice). The attendant at the ceramics spot is a true artist and will help turn your child\u2019s (or your) items into true works of art. We were sad to leave and after a week at Royal Haciendas one clearly gets to understand why so many people love Royal Resorts. We met lots of multi-week owners and owners who owned at various Royal Resorts. This is a great resort in a great location and we really enjoyed our time at Royal Haciendas and would enjoy a return visit. Definitely one of the better places we have stayed and great for families. The very few minor things that keep this from being a 10 in my book are all VERY minor. If you do visit Royal Haciendas keep in mind that all charges at the resort are made via your room key and paid for at check-out and they do not accept American Express (or Discover or Diners Club) so you need to have cash, travelers checks, or MC/VISA.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cPerfect combination of luxury and family atmospheres\u201d", "Author": "IAmom083", "ReviewID": "UR102435636", "Content": "We stayed here with a large group of family, we had several villas.

It is a brand new resort and our family were quite happy. We had a two bedroom suite on the 2nd floor. Rooms - We had beautiful views from the large terrace. Every room has a hot tub on the terrace (a large bathtub it is true, but then again, you get fresh water every time you fill it). Important plus for Mexico - the water is totally drinkable (we drank it extensively without side effects of any kind). The kitchen is fully equipped and we used it to make most of our own meals (well stocked convenience store on site; WalMart and Mega Mart a $10 cab ride away for main shopping). Resort: Start wtih the staff: unfailingly polite, helpful and omnipresent. I read a review critiquing the bar- I had beer at the bar (hard to ruin that) so I can't really comment. My kid's non-alcohol pina colada's were a bit weird tasting - so I guess they may need to adjust the mix they use. So what? The resort has two HUGE and beautiful main pools that never seemed crowded even though this was spring break. The water is crystal clear (not easy to do in a large resort with large numbers of people in the pools). In addition, a lap pool, some large hot tubs and water features all over the place. All the staff are polite, say hello and mean it. The grounds are beautifully maintained. We posted a picture of the view from our room which gives an idea. Our kids (13 and 14) quite happy. Good dive shop (Dive Balam) with competitive prices (we compared with prices in town). Masks and snorkels available for signing out at any time. Good family restaurant also does take out main dishes (which is great if you are using the kitchen in the unit- pick up a roast chicken and make your own vegetables). Location: about 2 miles from the ferry dock north of town. Cab fare is US$10 and takes about 10-15 mins. There is also a free shuttle during the day. Critiques: not many, mostly growing pains for a new resort. WiFi works around the resort, but was pretty spotty in our suite. They had trouble with their satellite TV for a few English channels while we were there. Some of their prices were quite competitive (dive shop, convenience store was no more expensive then any convenience store relative to a WalMart). Spa - prices were crazy relative to all around (massages US$120 on the beach vs about $35-$45 everywhere else). Hot tubs - were very large, but generally kept at such a low temperature as to detract from their utility (on the other hand, private hot tubs on each terrace that you can fill at whatever temperature you desire). I guess they could adjust the mixes they use in the bar, but not something I notice much as I don't drink mixed drinks often. If you travel with a family, the ability to do cooking in your own suite for at least some meals every day is a huge, huge plus. Highly recommend it to anyone traveling with kids or looking for something quiet, elegant and relaxing.

Great alternative to the \u2018spring break\u2019 resorts and I know a lot of people appreciate that. But like I said- no night life at all. (I guess that\u2019s what downtown is for) 3. Hot tubs were suppose to be for adults only (clearly marked), but every time we were in them, a group of kids (all ages) would be in there too. Not a huge deal, but it would have been nice to have an adult only zone. 4. Kind of pricy. Not that bad, but its Mexico and I expected to see some cheaper prices but it was like vacationing in Miami (as far as prices went). Still, affordable, but by no means a bargain. With that said, the value was pretty good. 5. It is a timeshare- they aren\u2019t pushy about it\u2026 but you will hear about it a little. Because of that, check in is Saturday to Saturday and if you want to stay any other days, you\u2019ll most likely have to change rooms (if you don\u2019t go there on a timeshare). Saturdays are a zoo because of that. And absolutely NO late checkout- $100 for every hour you overstay, no exceptions. But because of this they are able to offer early check-in sometimes if you need it, so that\u2019s nice.

The place has little added features, such as hammock gardens, kayaks, water fountains and private whirlpool tubs outside on each balcony.

We were only asked once to attend the timeshare sales meeting and once we said \"No Thanks\", we never heard from them again.

Our young kids enjoyed the pool and hot tubs, the outdoor chess game, and activities center. Make sure to take the short drive to go shopping in Playa del Carmen - you'll find a mix of typical Mexican merchandise all the way to high-end boutiques and name brand stores. The resort's convenience store was \"convenient\" but pricey and small. The resort's restaurants were OK - we enjoyed La Palapa del Sol because it was casual and on the beach. The rooms are very big with lots of storage, free wireless internet service, nicely decorated and had all the amenities needed to call it \"home\" for the week. It looks like just about every room has a view of the ocean. We were lucky enough to get a fourth-floor room -- very nice views! The negatives: The resort itself is very clean. However, if you like walking the beach and leaving the property, I'm warning you that the grounds on each side of the resort are filled with garbage/litter -- very, very sad. It is not the resort's fault, but a definite slam on the area overall. At the resort, things are pretty pricey, especially the food and drinks and convenient store.

The resort still lets people smoke - it would be great if they could have a \"smokers\" section on the beach so the rest of us didn't have to be around the smoke. And one last thing...they need to turn up the heat in the hot tub. The pool temp was fine, but the hot tub was only a \"warm\" tub while we were there.

We were assigned a personal concierge (Alan), who was gracious and helpful. He even arranged to have the NY GIants football game on one of the Lobby bar TVs for me because the Sports Bar was showing two other NFL games.

The on site restaurants are good (Los Murales is GREAT), and there is also take out and delivery from the La Palapa restaurant. We often had lunch poolside or on the beach, and the food was great. I took the opportunity to get my SCUBA certification at the on site dive center (Dive Balam). The staff there is great and very professional (shout out to Gustavo and Javier!)

We are members and have an oceanfront villa, one week out of the year. The grounds are beautiful and well kept, as are the Villas. I will say we are very happy that our villa is located in Phase II which has a quieter pool and a better beach. The gym is well worth the daily use fee, all of the equipment is excellent and the room is well maintained. It is standard at most resorts to charge for the use of the gym these days anyhow. My favorite things -The spa on the balcony -The kitchen is spacious and has everything you need -Housekeeping does a great job -Everything is super cheap - drinks, food etc -The market has a good selection - just wish they brought back the Mexican chorizo -The food at the pool is delish! -Plenty of spaces to relax -Calle 5 in Playa- great food, fun and bars. We come here for the laid back vibe that is so un-Cancun like. -The bartenders and beach attendants are always friendly and always fast Things that could be improved -The food choices at night- we got sick at the new restaurant one night even though the food was really good, the food at the Palapa del Sol is consistently \"blah\", wish they served casual, authentic Mexican food at night like at the Royal Sands...carne asada, Mexican style lobster, ceviche, tacos... -Entertainment at night- How about a good local, live band- maybe some reggae, something fun?? Anything for those of us who like some lively nightlife and don't feel like going out to Playa every night. - How about turning the pool at Phase II into an adults only pool? Would be nice not to have kids sitting on the pool bar, splashing water and yelling. -The concierge/salesperson calling you at 9am in the morning. We are on vacation to relax and sleep in! -The bedding is horrendous; the beds have a thin flimsy mattress and scratchy sheets -When checking out, they really rush you out of the room, sometimes even bringing the next guest into your dirty room before you are even out the door.

Overall, if you are looking for a good value and nice accommodations in a great town- this is your place. Having an oceanfront room makes all the difference for us, as we typically stay in 5 star luxury resorts, and an equivalent room in terms of size and location at the Fairmont or Mandarin in the Riviera Maya would cost three to four times as much. It is equivalent to staying in a 3-4 star hotel, like a Hilton or Marriott. Overall, we are happy to be members and have noticed that the resort has made some needed changes since it first opened and we are hoping they will continue to evolve for the best.

It can feel like one never left the midwestern excited states. There are planned daily activiities for children and their parents. Indeed, there is a feeling of a christian summer camp. If that sounds good to you, this is a great place. This huge property of over 250 2 bedroom time shared condominium units is in the middle of nowhere. But then, all of the resorts in the Playa del Carmen area are in what was once jungle. The native landscape has been razed to make way for the construction of resorts and time share pyramids. Parenthetically, the 2010 environment summit conference was held nearby while we were staying here. A very interesting juxtapostion... Anyway, all food and beverage service in this resort shuts down at 10 P.M. The restaurants, the bars and grocery store close are all closed by 10. So, one must get in a cab and go into Playa del Carmen after 10. It is widely advertised that it's a 5 minute cab ride. No way. It can be a five minute walk or more just to get from one's cell to the taxi stand of the resort. The cab ride (fixed price of 100 pesos, about 10 bucks, tip not included) to the center of Playa del Carmen is at least 15 minutes, and can be longer because of traffic. That said, the rooms are as advertised. Spacious. Comfortable. Really clean. The hot tub on the deck is terrific. Yup, the rooms themselves are just great. BUT, one doesn't spend an entire vacation in a hotel room. There are no bidets. There is no room service. One is constantly reminded, this is a TIME SHARE property. SALES of the TIME SHARES are of paramount importance. There are security personnel everywhere. If you want to enjoy a meal in the ocean view restaurant (beautiful), it seems there's always a cop, (some uniformed staff person) blowing the view. Incessant whistle blowing at random times of the day. Organized excercise activities. Boot camp. Light sleepers might want to take a pass. There is a constant air-conditioning noise from adjacent apartments. Not too loud, but always there. 24/7. A note about BEGGING. A small envelope left by the housekeeping staff reads: \u201cRoyal Resorts is proud of its Housekeeping staff and their excellent work. We keep high standards and will continue to give you the attention and service you deserve. We would like to thank you for tipping our maids and may we suggest that you use this envelope. You can leave it in the Tip Box at the Front Desk, of, if you prefer to give it to your maid in person, please feel free to do so.\u201d It's begging and it's not classy at all. If the corporation is so proud of the excellent work of the staff, how about paying them enough so there is no begging. By the way, if you get sucked into the time share spiel, you might want to have a look at the resales of this property first. For example: http://www.sellmytimesharenow.com/timeshares/index/content/search_sell/offset/0/SearchType/resales/Operation/5/SearchResortID/7165/order/price/ Beware of thinking you can cancel a reservation once made and paid for. This is not a hotel. Once payment is made, the house policy is there are NO REFUNDS. BEWARE! One could make a reservation for a few days to test the water, and extend the stay if the accomodations suit. There is no charge for internet service in the room, but it's not very good. Too slow to stream video for example. Good enough to pick up e-mail etc. There is a do-it-yourself laundry. It can be a very long walk to the facility. I don't know why it's closed on Sunday, but it is. The pricey mixed drinks at the beach bar are severly watered down. Severely. A cheapo grind. Not classy. I never tried the lobby bar. It was closed the one night I tried to get a drink at around 10:30. Each visiting group/family is assigned a \"concierge\". It's a misnomer. At this place a concierge is someone who is going to try to sell you the TIME SHARE. These are professionally trained pests. There is no conventional hotel concierge on the property. After all, it's not a hotel. There are no screens on the windows and doors, and they are needed. If one likes fresh air, maybe when one sleeps, one is going to be bitten. We were here in the high season, a couple of weeks in December, which is the one of the coolest and least humid times of the year. The bugs are a\u2019 bitin\u2019 anyway. One can only imagine what it\u2019s like here when it starts getting sticky. It is in a jungle after all. This could be a perfect desination for an ethnocentric american family. It can feel like one never left the midwestern excited states. There are planned daily activiities for children and their parents. Indeed, there is a feeling of a christian summer camp.

They offered free trips, taxi rides, meals, etc., and it took awhile to figure out what they were talking about. They never did mention timeshare, but we finally left when they indicated we had to decide right then and there if we wanted their offer of these freebies. Another hint was their request for a deposit. We finally shook them, but I\u2019d recommend walking right past all of them. Finally we got out of the airport building, met our transport, and were so pleased to be away from all the commotion. The quietness of the Royal Haciendas proved to be just what we wanted. We stayed here for 1 week in November, as an exchange from Interval International. This is a lovely, quiet resort. The staff was efficient, helpful, and friendly. We did meet one staff member who did not fit this description, but she stood out because she was so unlike the rest of the staff. The resort is very well-maintained and clean. Unlike some other time-shares, there is daily maid service except Sundays and Mexican holidays. You are also assigned a personal concierge, but we really didn\u2019t need his services. We did enjoy the complimentary wi-fi in our suite. Our reception was good, but apparently this is not true in all rooms. There are a number of TV channels, some in Spanish, some in English, and some with Spanish subtitles. There are a number of activities available on the grounds, including use of 2 large infinity pools, 2 lap pools, 2 children pools, and 4 large whirlpools. There are also many covered hammock areas and many lounge chairs around the pools and at the beach. While one small area of the sea at the beach is rocky, there are plenty of good sandy swimming areas and the beach is quite large. There are plenty of organized activities for adults and kids, an activities center, and a number of complimentary perks including use of sea kayaks, tennis racquets, and snorkel equipment. Non-complimentary activities include the spa, use of the gym, and scuba diving. Royal Resorts has their own travel service (Thomas Moore), which provides transportation to and from the airport (for a fee), complimentary scheduled transportation into Playa del Carmen, and numerous excursions to theme parks, archeological sites, and adventure places. Those are all on their website, with prices. Overall the resort shows quality construction and our room was well sound insulated. The whole resort seems to be handicapped accessible right down to the beach, with wide ramps that are well-designed and fit with the overall architecture. The tap water is filtered and potable, but doesn\u2019t taste very good, so you may want to go with bottled water. They recycle cans and bottles \u2013 another plus. Smoking is not allowed inside the rooms/villas/suites. The rooms/villas/suites are listed as either ocean view or ocean front. Be aware that you can\u2019t really see the ocean from some rooms. Well, I guess if one squints between the palm leaves, you might see a hint of blue, which could be the sea or the sky, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re looking at the Caribbean. Our one bedroom suite was on the ground floor, close to a children\u2019s pool. While I had been concerned that we would not have much privacy from people walking by, this was not a problem. The children\u2019s pool is a ways off, and until our 5th day, we never saw anyone use it or even sit on the surrounding chairs. While you probably wouldn\u2019t want to use the deck hot tub au natural, it\u2019s private enough. Actually the only people you see from the deck are the maintenance people who occasionally walk by. The kitchen in our suite was well-supplied with dishes, utensils, pots, pans, bowls, blender, coffee maker, toaster, and regular appliances. Salt and pepper shakers and dishwasher detergent were supplied, but we missed having paper towels, sugar, detergent to hand wash dishes, and hand soap at the kitchen sink. Also, unlike hotels and other time-shares we\u2019ve used, they did not supply daily shampoo, lotion, and that type of amenity. We did receive one small bottle of shampoo and some body wash from the spa, but that was it. The store on the grounds is somewhat expensive, but it is handy. They sell basics, with some fresh vegetables, some frozen foods, etc. There are several restaurants on the grounds including one new upscale restaurant, which we didn\u2019t try. The main restaurant, open all day, has excellent food. There are also some hamburger bars, etc. near the pools. There is at least one bar, and you can get drinks in the restaurants and at the pools, of course. Overall we were pleased with our stay here and would recommend this place to others. While I mentioned a few things that they didn\u2019t have, this was more to warn others what to expect and is not a complaint.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sisters, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cPlaya del Carmen doesn't get any better than this\u201d", "Author": "cRoss55", "ReviewID": "UR86742020", "Content": "We visited here last year for a weekend, this time for a full week.

The Palapa del Sol is the more causal of the two but the food for both breakfast and dinner was VERY good. (The hostess at dinner, Rusely, deserves special mention.

Everyone was offered bottled water upon arrival. We were not members at this resort, so we had a much longer check-in line (~20-25 min wait). We noticed quite enviously that the members had a welcome lounge and free drinks while they checked in. We were assigned a ground-floor villa. The view was of the activities center and the pools and beach beyond. We had plenty of good lighting in the villa, and decor was very nice and modern. Throughout our stay, we heard some noises and guessed it was either noisy neighbors or construction. The villa was very clean when we arrived. The hot tub on the patio was a great feature. Ours did not drain properly, and when we reported it, the attentive maintenance staff arrived within 10 minutes to fix the problem. Maid service was offered each day except Sunday. At orientation on Sunday, we were told to tip the maids $5/day. Tip jars were in view at the welcome party on Sunday (free beers and rum+cokes) and the taco party on Monday. These events, however, were very nice touches to welcome guests to the resort. The resort is extremely quiet in the evenings, with not much going on for entertainment. Free internet; signal was weak at times but was strongest near the lobby. Gym was $8/day or $38/week, which we thought was ridiculous. Snorkel and kayak gear were free, but snorkeling and kayaking were canceled on the days we were there due to rough waves. Convenience store on site had a wide range of items, from alcohol to dairy products and souvenirs. Free shuttle to Playa del Carmen; due to an agreement with the area's taxi union, the last shuttle back to the resort is at 6:30pm, so don't expect to have a free ride back after dinner; you'll have to take a taxi. Spa services offered were similar to high-end services offered at resorts in the US, and priced similarly as well. From the time-share sales pitch, we learned that 80%+ of the owners at this resort are Americans, so the resort seems to charge high US prices for everything. Resort grounds were very clean. The beach was clean with gorgeous white sand, and there were plenty of chairs at the beach and pools. Hammocks were arranged between the resort buildings. Two lap pools and several kids' pools. Two very large pools with swim-up bars. Two pool-side restaurants served lunch and happy hour. Waiters were very attentive to those at the beach and pools. Prices: ~$9-15 for wraps/sandwiches/burgers, ~$3-7 for happy hour drinks. We found the wraps and sandwiches to be acceptable, but the happy hour drinks were weak. The large beach restaurant has a very nice ambiance, with high thatched-roof ceiling and beautiful view of the ocean; we went to the ~$25 \"international night\" dinner buffet and found the food to be bland though acceptable. There was a high-end expensive restaurant on site, but we peeked in one night and didn't see anyone in there, and we certainly didn't eat there either. The kitchen in the villa was well-stocked with cooking equipment, and we went to the Walmart in Playa del Carmen to buy reasonably-priced food supplies. The resort very conveniently had filtered water, so drinking the tap water was okay. Our biggest problem was that the pillows and beds were very firm and not very comfortable. The resort also did not provide shampoo/conditioner/lotion. Our personal concierge, although very friendly and nice, seemed to be most interested in getting us to have a free lunch with the sales staff. All the restaurant, activities, cleaning, maid, front desk, and maintenance staff at the resort were very friendly and responsive to inquiries or requests in English. Transportation to and from the airport was through Thomas More Travel ($45 roundtrip per person for shared 40-min shuttle ride). Thomas More Travel was also the on-site agency for arranging all excursions ($65 for snorkeling, $100+ packages to eco parks and Cozumel). We didn't do any of these excursions so cannot comment on their value. We had a relaxing vacation at this time-share resort but may try an all-inclusive resort next time, mostly so we don't feel the need to cook.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle,wa", "Title": "\u201cANOTHER GREAT STAY BUT.........\u201d", "Author": "suzy0525", "ReviewID": "UR82251841", "Content": "We just returned from the Hacienda October 2nd. This was our third time there via a trade through Interval. First, we ABSOLUTELY do love it there, or we wouldn't go back each year. BUT, I do agree with the previous comment about how we had to check in. Our prior 2 visits we were warmly welcomed with water and directed to the check-in counter. This year, we were instantly asked if we had been there before and were we owners? Before anyone even said hello. We were then directed to the one employee in the back corner of the room. The most offensive part of this check-in process for me was the \"rope\" separating us from \"them\" (the owners). I truly felt like a girl in high school, and I wasn't the popular one! (Thank god I WAS popular once I got outside to the bar!!!) While waiting at this \"desk\", I then heard a blender. I looked over, and the people on the \"other side\" of the rope were being given Margaritas! Wow. Another vacation slap in the face. After being up all night to get to the Hacienda, and I didn't even deserve a welcome beverage. And boy, with the near hurricane weather on arrival day, I so badly needed it. We were given a ground floor room, which was not my first choice, but it was in the building we have been in each year, and requested, so I lived with it. I also inquired about a change of room, but was told no. We met a fabulous couple day 1 at the bar who told us you can only move to an available Interval room, and there aren't usually very many. If no availability was true or not, I don't know. There are alot of vacant room this time of the year, but oh well. I am also an owner at a Marriott property, but I've never felt like an outsider in any other property like I did at check-in this year. It was very poorly planned by Management. If they think this is a way to make their property more desireable, they are sadly mistaken. I was so upset I considered never returning, but my favorite waiter outside at the Aqua Bar (Juan Jose) quickly changed my mind about that! NOTE TO MANAGEMENT: You never know who may purchase at your property, and first impressions are HUGE for most people, especially in this recession. Making new customers feel like outsiders is not a great selling point. I would also point out that non-owners spend just as much money at your property as your owners (if not more). So I would STRONGLY suggest you re-think this new change before next year. Moving on to the positives, and there are many. The property is beautiful, from the room on. The pools and beach are beautiful. We love the bar, and spend most of our time at the pool having tasty beverages and meeting new people. The bar staff is excellent, a main reason I return each year. September is hurricane season, so the first 3-4 days were VERY wet, but eventually the sun returned. The town is alot of fun, and easy to shuttle to. On 5th Avenue there is every possible shop, restaurant, or bar you may want. I love this resort mainly because it is gorgeous, and you can just relax. Not alot of kids, which I also enjoy. And makes for a great romantic adult vacation. Happy hour prices are great, and we travel alot., so we've paid much more. The bar food is also great. My one comment, we wish the pool bars were open MUCH LATER and served food past 5 pm. This is always our main complaint, and granted it is minor, but there is really no place to \"hang out\" and socialize with other people unless you go to the lobby bar, and no one does. Your evening choices are the La Palma or the new steak house. Both have great food, but when I'm on vacation I would much rather have a cold beer and bar food. And the lower prices that go with it. This year was the first time they had \"events' in the evenings, and it was great. (Thank you Hacienda for listening to your customers). But no one knew about it! They had a live band that was FABULOUS! And there were 6 people in the room. They had karaoke the next night, maybe 20 people, but again, hardly anyone knew. How great if they advertised their events with maybe a newsletter? Or signs at the bars? Long story short......we do love the Hacienda. If you want a crazy, event filled vacation, this is not the place for you. Try Cancun. But we love the staff, you can usually count on the weather, and the property is beautiful. Even with my sad and disappointing start, I will most likely return. And hopefully I will return to an employee with a warm smile, and a cold tasty beverage to welcome me!", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Resort!\u201d", "Author": "happytraveler999", "ReviewID": "UR81914001", "Content": "Stayed at Royal Hacienda for a week in August 2010.

We did shop at the store and made a light dinner a couple of nights, which was very handy after a long day. The Thomas More tours were great, we went snorkeling in Akumal and visited the cenotes. Other days we took the ferry to Cozumel from Playa and took a taxi to Puerto Morelos.

My husband and I travel to Playa del Carmen approximately four times a year and usually stay at small inns in town. We decided to change it up and stay at the resort this time, we thought that this resort would be walking distance to town, it really is not. The negatives first. They have a nice fitness center, but it cost $8.00 a day. I think that is ridiculous and it should be included. Let me guess next they will charge for towel rental and a pool service charge every time you take a dip\u2026I HATE being nickled and dimed. On top of the fee, the hours for the gym could have been longer. If you are going to charge you better have amazing hours. Plus the place is closed on Saturdays, so when you purchase a \"one week rate\", it is not for the whole week at all for some ridiculous reason the gym is closed on Saturday. It would have been very nice to work out before the long day at the airport and sitting on an airplane. It was a nice gym that was very well equipped with state of the art equipment. I did not go right away in the morning a few days and waited until the afternoon or evening, numerous times I had the place to myself so that was very nice. Do not expect to come here and enjoy a cheap spa vacation. The spa services where all rather expensive, that was disappointing. I was able to use a portion of the spa, due to my daily $8.00 gym fee. It was a very nice spa and everyone working there was extremely nice and helpful but services where extremely costly. Regarding the room: The sheets and comforter where ok, I think the quality of those items could have been better. The mattress was nice. We hated the huge tub you had to jump in to use the shower, that was ridiculous. The patio and the view was amazing !! Free WI-FI was extremely nice and the offering of TV channels was wonderful on the day that it rained all day and night. The rooms where extremely quiet and we never heard anything from the neighbors or the hall. AHHH..shuttle service, this would be a cheap fix for the resort, we are really only ten minutes from downtown, run a shuttle service every hour from 9:00am -9:00pm. It would not cost that much and it would give you huge bonus points from your guests. We had issues with the shuttle service, it could be improved. The market place has an excellent selection and they did not take advantage of you on their prices. The pharmacists went out of their way to be helpful. The big pool was amazing !!! But I did not understand the kiddie pool that they had, that no one was every at. Change the kiddie pool into something else so this is not a waste of space!!!!!!!! Back to the big pool, wonderful, wonderful bartenders and wait staff. Drinks at happy hour had great prices, why they do not run happy hour longer, I do not understand. Loved the pool super huge and nice!! The wraps and the Lime Soup where excellent. The prices at the buffet where ridiculously expensive, $18.00 for breakfast- that is crazy, we went to town for under $5.00 for an amazing breakfast. The beach was beautiful, but it was rather rocky, bring your beach shoes/sandals if you want to go swimming. The beach was very nice and so was the water temperature and the beach furniture. The resort hammocks where very nice, bring a book or a magazine and enjoy a few hours in the wonderful hammock area. The resort was nice, but nothing over the top !!!..", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay !!\u201d", "Author": "namelama", "ReviewID": "UR75849013", "Content": "I will not echo the many reviews before ours but I will say the resort is a fabulous facility but its too new to have an established entertainment value. If you're looking for a quiet place with not much activity unless you go into the city, this is it! Phase I or II are both excellent locations although most of the activities originate in Phase I. There are more activities for children in Phase I and almost all of the welcoming parties are in Phase I. The restaurants are average and not much to rave about. If you go into town, the meals are cheaper but it costs you $20 for a roundtrip taxi. We stayed here the 3rd week in August and the place was not very occupied which was nice. The Villas are equipped with free wireless internet, a fully stocked kitchen, flat panel TV's in every room, and nice furniture. Depending on what you're looking for, the place is only 4 years old and it could use some entertainment help with better communication between visitors. You see people come and go without ever knowing their names or where they're visiting from. I would highly recommend two things for a perfect vacation facility, all inclusive meal program and quality entertainment so that people do not have to leave the property in search of the unknown in Playa del Carmen. The beaches are nice and the water is warm. Snorkeling equipment, kayak tours, water vests, and many other outdoor equipment available to check out for activities.

The resort is lovely with beautiful landscaping of tropical plants and green green grass. The layout is really nice with pools, hammocks, and plant/water pools throughout. The pool was clean and the perfect temperature, refreshing but not too cold. I liked that you could see the ocean from the pool. The infinity is a nice touch too. The happy hour was our favorite time at the pool bar and the margaritas are excellent! The beach is good but not great. There are better beaches in the Mayan Riviera but we liked the privacy of the beach and that there were plenty of chairs with sun covering and drink/food service. Nothing better than reading a book ocean front! We went to the beach in Playa Del Carmen (Gran Puerto Real) which was fun but I missed the privacy of the Haciendas' beach. The rooms at the Haciendas are outstanding. We had the one bedroom villa and it had three separate rooms. The kitchen is large with granite, bar stools, full refrigerator, oven, microwave,.... We ate breakfast and lunch in our room which saved money. We ate in town most nights. My only complaint is the resort does not provide a way to wash dishes by hand. There is a dishwasher and they provide soap. I would bring a small bottle of dish wash soap or buy one in market ($2.00). The hot tub on the balcony was my favorite part of the room. Sitting in the tub with the fantastic ocean view and a glass of wine was the perfect ending to our days I would stay here again just for the tub. Bring bubbles and enjoy. :) We ate two meals at the resort- La Palapa (ok) and the new sea food restaurant by the lobby. It was very good but pricey. The setting is beautiful and the food was delicious. The shuttle is great! I don't know why people have complained. We had a car for the first half of our trip (Easy Way- strongly recommend). The last shuttle leaves at 6:30, just sign up at the front desk. We took the shuttle into town and arranged a pick up time too one day. They even gave us a cold bottle of water once we got in the van. Great touch! I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It is close enough to Playa to shop and eat out but far enough away to relax with a peaceful beach.

Traveling with extended family we rented three two-bedroom, two-bathroom units in the newest section. The units are very spacious and tastefully decorated with a distinctly Mexican theme. The furniture is of very good quality. Our units had fully equipped kitchens that we made good use of, even though there are several on-site dining options. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The resort was apparently inspired by the Haciendas of the Yucatan and you can see that in the architecture. The building colors spark conversation with other guests but I really liked them. The yellow in particular seems to change color depending on the time of day and at night the entire resort seems to glow, just lovely. The whole resort is kept immaculately clean, from the units to all the public areas and gardens. I even saw staff cleaning the beach every day. I was surprised to see a review that criticized the beach as we all thought the beach was lovely. One morning we walked south, most of the way to Playa del Carmen and it was a wonderful activity. While the beach does have some rocky areas these are well marked by red flags placed by the lifeguards. We found the best part of the beach for swimming was right in front of the north side of the property, and during our week the beach actually improved. When we arrived the edge of the water had quite a few rocks and pebbles which made getting in the water tricky, but by the end of the week they had all been covered with sand. Once a few yards into the water, the bottom was sandy and we stood and splashed around for hours talking and enjoying the ever-changing water color. Which is a really easy way to get sun-burned... please note! On Sunday morning we enjoyed a very good breakfast buffet that more or less served as a brunch for us. They have everything from a large selection of local fruits to an array of pre-cooked and cook-to-order items, including huevos rancheros which I highly recommend. The wait staff were very attentive even though this is a buffet. The resort is divided into two U shape sections, each of which has a very large main pool, lap pool and large hot-tubs. We all made great use of the pools, especially the 25 meter lap pool where we attempted to burn off some of the calories that we had consumed at the pool bar :-). Lots of activities were available although as we were here for a family reunion we mainly spent time together on the beach, in the sea, in the pools and in our spacious units - especially the balconies which all had ocean-facing views. Another great feature is the on-site convenience store. I cannot recall another resort hotel that has this feature on-site. While the imported items are a little pricey, the local equivalents are very reasonable indeed and shopping there was much easier than flogging down to a supermarket in Playa del Carmen. But best of all had to be the maid service. Our maid was called Minerva and every day she delighted us with a different animal creation that she made with towels, face-cloths and flowers that she would leave on our bed. It has been a bit of a shock getting home and having to make my own bed! You may find a more luxurious hotel in the Riviera Maya, but I challenge anyone to find another resort with the combination of spacious, multi-bedroom suites with the services and facilities on offer at The Royal Haciendas. There is also a great deal to enjoy in the local area - but the highlight for us was a trip to the Xplor theme park, while not for the faint-hearted with it's high ziplines, it is a brilliantly conceived and run place which I would highly recommend. Playa del Carmen is also worth visiting but in my opinion, the famous 5th Avenue pedestrian-only area is best enjoyed at night. There are a huge number of restaurants, bars, lounges, cafes etc and the atmosphere is great. You will bump into people from all over and hear many different languages, if like me you sit at a bar while your other half is shopping.

It wasn't until staying at the Haciendas that I realized all that is lacking at the Mayan, Caribbean, Islander etc. It's the colors, gardens and architectural upgrades that make the Haciendas stand out from the rest. From the balconies to the rooms to the lobby and restaurants, the entire place is bright and inviting. The rooms have all the great standards that have made the Royals special for all these years but they've added certain luxuries that make you appreciate it even more. From small details like a bathing suit hanger in the bedroom to the bigger perks like a jacuzzi on the balcony and HUGE walk-in tile showers, they've set themselves apart. Everything here feels new and clean. Simply walk out onto the balcony and over look the beautiful gardens and fountains surrounded by 6 or so floors of bright, cheerful villas just like yours. There is no mistaking where you are. It's a true Mexican vacation. The grounds have kiddy pools to the back, lap pools in the middle and heated main pools to the front with an over-sized hot tub to each side. So there is plenty of water for the non-sea swimmers. If you're up for a Banana Monkey any other fun drink, each main pool has a grande swim-up bar. There are plenty of seats around all the pool areas, as well as hammocks, or you can head down to the beach where you'll find enough seating around the long the stretch of palapas. After reading certain reviews, we were a bit worried about the beaches in Playa. Where it's true, there isn't the amazing blue waters of Cancun or the fun challenge of large rolling waves, it wasn't so bad. It was fairly calm water and you are able to walk out quite a ways. The first 10 yards or so, you may have to watch your step for some large rocks but once you're out far enough, there were no real concerns of twisting your ankle or stubbing your toe. However, if you are one who goes to Mexico primarily for the Sea, I wouldn't recommend this location. Cancun would still be your spot. You can, however, take out kayaks or snorkeling masks though everyone agreed that the visibility was poor. As far as beach quality, it was powder-soft sand that felt great on the feet. No problems there. We rarely dined at the resort but we did take advantage of the breakfast buffet each and every morning as we have at all the Royals. I find it's always worth the money for the fresh fruit, made-to-order pancakes and waffles, fresh juices and a variety of different pork, chicken and beef dishes as well as all the standard breakfast favorites. It's a great way to fill up the belly so you won't have to leave that lounge chair until the sun goes down. ;-) Overall, I'd have to say the Royal Haciendas is a four star resort. I only have a few suggestions that would make them easily five stars. The staff was friendly but not very efficient. It's expected for the guests to be slow and leisurely but we found the staff to be more so than even us. It usually took a long time to get any service. Especially cashing out. It had to take 30 minutes each time we wanted to sign our bill. In addition, they need to perfect their shuttle system. They have free shuttles going in and out of Playa Del Carmen all day. That is, until you actually need one. They stop the shuttle service at 6pm which forces everyone to take a taxi for $10 each way to dinner. This is not an all-inclusive resort and most would prefer to dine in town. 7 days of $10 back and forth through taxis adds up. Oh, and just one more small thing I have to throw in......beware of the man who comes in every morning to play the flute at breakfast. Note to the Royals: American 80's music through a flute sort of ruins the atmosphere. Not much Mexican flavor to that. Haha, I don't know why I had to add that. If these things are the worst I could find, I'm sure you'll get the idea that the Royal Haciendas is an amazing place to take a vacation.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shrewsbury, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cThe Royal Haciendas is a very good resort that will not disappoint, just not a Beach Lover's paradise!\u201d", "Author": "BeachTraveler228", "ReviewID": "UR62428970", "Content": "Overall - All in all the Royal Haciendas is a very good resort that will not disappoint. The resort is very new and has lovely grounds, pools, rooms and amenities. The location is very close to thriving downtown Playa Del Carmen. The resort is very clean, has friendly staff and will result in a fun, relaxing time. However, if you are expecting a great beach resort with great beach front, please consider this resort carefully as this is the only major drawback of the resort. From what I can tell from walking the beachfront for hours and talking to many people, most of the Mayan Riviera properties suffer from this issue as well so I am not sure you will find a Cancun beach type of resort in the Mayan Riviera. Therefore the Royal Haciendas is probably one of the better resorts to choose given the quality of the resort and its proximity to Playa. Rooms \u2013 the rooms are very spacious and well configured for families. They are very modern with granite countertops, new appliances, large TV\u2019s, DVD players, etc. We stayed in an A/B unit which had 3 large rooms. One room was a kids room with bathroom, wetbar/fridge and 2 double beds. The center room is a huge living area with full kitchen, eating table, couch area and two additional trundle bends. The third room was a large master bedroom with a king size bed a very large stall shower. There is a Jacuzzi tub on the balcony. Our unit overlooked the pool and was the second unit in from the beach. Overall the rooms are very nice and a highlight of the resort. Location \u2013 if you are looking for a resort that is close to Playa this is a good choice. While not in downtown Playa proper, it\u2019s about a 10 minute cab ride (about $10 USD each way for up to 4 people \u2013 tip, if you are five people don\u2019t take a van since the price goes up to $20 USD each way \u2013 squeeze 5 people into a car). It\u2019s about a 1 hour walk on the beach to downtown. You might do it once but it\u2019s a fairly long hike so would not expect you\u2019d do this often. You also wouldn\u2019t walk on the road (Federal Highway 307) as it\u2019s a busy highway. A word of caution, there is nothing built yet to the left and right of the resort so there is not much to walk on the beach. If you like to take beach strolls this is not the resort for you. They are building other resorts in the complex as well as a beautiful golf course but it is not yet finished. Once completed there may be more to walk to, but right now the Royal Haciendas is fairly isolated and the area to the left and right is not great looking. I do suggest going into Playa each night for walking around and for dinner as there are a lot of great restaurants to choose from on 5th Ave ranging from Italian to Mexican to Seafood and Steak. Pools and Grounds \u2013 one of the best attributes of the resort is the pool and grounds. Very large, spacious pools with plenty of room so you never feel crowded. Large ledge in pool for sundeck bathing (you can bring your lounge chair right into the water). Great area for small kids to play in (very shallow in areas). Fairly shallow throughout pool so you can walk around entire pool (no real deep end). Great swim-up bars which are a real focal point given their rich red color and ample seating. Also a nice kids pool, but it was never used since it is set very far back in the resort. Also small lap pool (also used for water volleyball) which is quieter. Lot\u2019s of nice hot tubs to enjoy as well. You will spend most your time at the pool. Beach \u2013 after reading all the reviews about the beach at this resort, this was my biggest area of confusion. I read all the reviews and can understand the various perspectives. My view is that if you are really beach lovers, this is not the place for you. If you are expecting the beautiful aqua colored waters and waves that are found up north in Cancun, you will be disappointed (just to be sure, we took a day trip to Cancun to the sister property The Royal Sands and the beach was much nicer). The Royal Haciendas is set in a small cove and is in the Cozumel channel so it is not technically set in the open sea as it is up north in Cancun (making it much less wavy). The resort has 3 beach areas \u2013 one to the left for swimming (with less rocks), one in front of the restaurant that is all rocks (with no activities allowed due to the rocks) and a reef area to the right (mostly for snorkeling, not swimming). Even in the designated swimming area there are enough rocks you need to watch out when you are swimming. It is certainly swimmable beach, but just not the Caribbean water and experience you may be used to. The water was either really calm or had slight waves on windy days. The water color is more green than aqua blue and at times had a odd odor when swimming (maybe due to seaweed at low tide?). There were nice beach front huts with adequate beach seating and service, but we ended up not sitting there much due to the quality/aura of the beach. So the bottom line is if the beach is not a huge part of what you are looking for and you are content spending time at the pools, this should not be an issue. However, we were disappointed with the beach. Restaurants \u2013 the Royal resorts are not all inclusive so you have to do your meals on your own. The onsite restaurant locations are very limited. The Beach restaurant called La Palapala was okay for breakfast but is a typical theme night buffet for dinner. I would not recommend it for dinner. For breakfast, you end up spending about $18 USD per adult for the breakfast buffet which ends up being pricey (and extremely redundant as the selection did not change at all). I suggest doing breakfast in the rooms or getting coffee and a bagel or pastries to go at the restaurant as it is much cheaper. For lunch, the poolside dining is perfect. The burgers are huge ($10 USD) and the Grouper Sandwich is fantastic ($10 USD). The salads are also very good as is the Guacamole, Pico de Gallo and Chips. Can\u2019t beat the pool side lunches. I recommend sitting at one of the outdoor tables. There is a new seafood restaurant called Las Murales (?) which was good but more expensive than it needed to be \u2013 it was probably 2x the cost of what you could find in Playa. My recommendation is downtown Playa every night for dinner. The drink service was very good and overall the prices were not unreasonable for a non all inclusive resort. Great happy hour specials with \u00bd price drinks everyday from 3pm to 6pm. During happy hour a beer goes for $23 pesos ($2 USD) and a mixed drink for about $4 USD. Great deals. You can also buy beer, wine and alcohol at the onsite store. I recommend bringing a small soft pack cooler if you want to really be economical. Otherwise the daily bar tabs were not that unreasonable due to happy hour. The onsite store is convenient for incidentals and small items. If you are planning on having a lot in your room for meals and groceries, it is probably worth the trip to the mega Walmart in downtown Playa. Otherwise, just shopping at the onsite store will do. Activities \u2013 while there were organized activities each day, I would not say the resort has a great activities program. Typical daily activities such as water aerobics, water and beach volleyball, etc. are available as part of the resort. If you are looking for a resort that has constant activities by the pool (an entertainment staff, loud music, games, etc.), this is not it. Sometimes acvities did not have enough people (such as Beach volleyball) to play a full game. Water Sports \u2013 a reasonable amount of water sports are included/available at the resort. I recommend taking a Kayak out when the water is calm. Be sure to go out past the ropes and explore. It is very shallow and the water color is better the farther you go out. It feels like you could paddle all the way to Cozumel. I also suggest Snorkeling in the reef by the resort but it is fairly shallow. I suggest going at high tide. Also suggest going outside the ropes to snorkel. If you are really into good snorkeling, you must take a trip to Cozumel (we used a company called the \u201cFury\u201d which had a large catamaran) and snorkeled off the reefs there. Absolutely amazing. They also have beginner diving at the resort. You can try the equipment in the pool for free. You can spend $99 USD and get a 2 hour training in the morning followed by a dive in the afternoon.

My husband and I needed relaxation with choices of activities - that is exactly what we experienced. We loved the option of going to Hatha Yoga, Spanish Lessons etc. each day or of relaxing on the beach or beside the pool. There is also the option of pools; children's only, cool pool for extra hot days, warm pool for a bath-like experience or the hot tub for evening dips :) The snorkeling equipment was free to use and available at the sports desk each day - I was surprised at the number of fish I could see so close to the shoreline in front of the resort. The security on the beach (yes, even at 5:30 am when looking for a sunrise shot) and all over the resort is extraordinary. They are not intrusive; very professional but will say \"hola\" if you do! One thing I recommend; go to the Walmart in nearby Playa del Carmen (free shuttle to the town from resort each day - many times) early in your visit; we overspent at the somewhat overpriced on-site market out of desperation the first few days; too tired from the flight and getting used to our surroundings. Walmart is really super when it comes to yogurt, granola bars, cheese, crackers, boxed nectar juices, fruit for breakfast and lunches; leaves more money for dinners on-site; we found reasonable meals there. It cost us only 35.00 for two for coconut shrimp dinner including rice and fresh vegetables with non-alcoholic fruit drink. It was excellent tasting and excellent value for the money. There is nothing quite like lazing on the very new, clean lounge chairs all around the pools and on the beach on a sun-filled day - never under 80 degrees F. Just put the blue flag in the hole on the wooden pole holding up the thatch roof umbrellas (excellent coverage from strong sun rays) and a beach restaurant server will take your order! I really like that no money exchanges hands (other than tips u want to give servers - but don't have to) - guests use their room key to pay for everything and to identify themselves throughout the resort. The ONLY complaint we have is the size of the bed in the \"lock off\" unit we got in our exchange through interval international - we have a studio in Maui, Hawaii. The size, cleanliness and facilities of the unit were excellent, but the bed size was small - somewhere between a twin size and full sized mattress. It was cozy for the two of us; there were two of these beds in the room, but we wanted to sleep together :) I saw that in the other sections of the villa (there are three in total including the lock-off room) the main bedroom has a beautiful king-sized bed, the middle section has two twin murphy style beds that fold up easily into the wall so u cannot tell there are beds in the livingroom! I just wish the two beds in the lock-off unit were true queen sized beds; they are a little small. My husband had a massage at the resort spa; he was in heaven afterwards - he described the 2 hr. experience as the most relaxing ever! We went on a day trip to Xel-Ha - natural wonderland for snorkeling, lazy river tubing, dolphin swimming and manatee watching - super experience - spend ALL DAY there for full value. All your food and drink free all day with this all inclusive deal. We got ours FREE by sitting through a 90min. presentation at the Westin Hotel in Cancun. We did not sign on for anything, but got a free trip to Cancun from the resort including a side trip to Walmart to get our supplies, free breakfast and lunch and fully paid taxi there and back to the resort - we got this at the airport on our arrival from a person paid to get \"leads\" for potential buyers of timeshares. JUST DON\"T SIGN ANYTHING when you go to the presentation. We paid 45.00 at the airport and did get the 45.00 back when we came to the Westin Hotel in Cancun. Other resort people comment that this resort is \"out in the middle of nowhere\" , but that's why I like it = not in the middle of Cancun which looks like Miami with its never ending string of resorts along the shoreline - way too congested and not private at all. This resort is 45 min from Cancun, but a planned NEW AIRPORT in Tulum will make it only 35 min from an airport but still with a very private feeling.

Excellent value. It was a room with two double beds, an ocean view balcony and a microwave, coffee maker, fridge, and mini sink. This was our second trip to PDC and we were looking for a hotel offering a good beach, ocean views, AND a good swimming pool. It's hard to find all of the above in downtown PDC. While the Royal Haciendas resort is fairly far out of town (a 10-15 minute taxi ride - easy to get a taxi, just ask a bell man at the entrance), it offers a variety of pools, including kid pools, plus a fabulous beach. Since the PDC beaches tend to be rather windy and wavy, at least in the winter when we've been there, snorkeling is not as good as in Cozumel where the water is clearer, but you can try on calmer days. We were always able to find a palapa on the beach for shade, while at times the pool area chairs were filled up. Another plus of the beach is that the palapas are permanent and don't have to come down when it's windy. The sand is lovely for kids to play in. We walked to downtown Playa del Carmen one evening. It's about a three mile walk with some interesting things to see along the way. Stay out of the drying kelp/seaweed though - I got what may have been a sand flea bite on my foot which itched like crazy. We dined at the Palapa restaurant a few times and used the a la carte service to buy a roast chicken. The buffet does seem overpriced - we did the Mexican night buffet and the food was pretty good. We tried the breakfast buffet one time as well but ordered off the menu for two other dinners. Service can be slow, especially on the first Saturday night when many people check in and dine in as well. The chicken mole was quite good, and they do seafood quite well. We had the Mahi wraps at least four times from the Pool Bar/Beach service. Happy Hour drinks are a better deal. The Don Julio Blanco margs are delicious and can be really strong! We were able to breakfast and snack on our own with the in room microwave and fridge. That saves money and time and is helpful. I had been concerned that with the number of activities offered that the resort would be really noisy with piped music at all times etc. However, it was always possible to move to a part of the beach where we couldn't hear any of the activities, and the activities weren't very intrusive. I tried aqua-aerobics a couple of times. Quite fun and a good workout if you actually do the moves. I really appreciated the quiet of the resort. No piped music except at the pool bar area. The resort was very clean - people were always sweeping and cleaning. The pools were fairly warm, which seems somewhat rare in Mexico (where we've stayed anyway). Getting towels, pool toys, snorkels, etc. from the activities desk was very convenient. The bed linens/bedspread and the cheap plastic patio furniture keeps me from rating the room five stars. The beach and pool furniture could be more comfortable too. Apart from that though, the resort is beautiful, well maintained, and very comfortable. We'll certainly consider staying here again.

My husband and I had the most relaxing vacation we have ever been on. The beds were heavenly and the view stunning. Below are a few of the issues that have been raised on other posts: Value: When I looked at comparable resorts in the area for the week of New Year's, this one was easily 200 dollars a night less expensive for the size and quality of the unit. Add the fact that there is a full kitchen and no extra charge for room service and it almost becomes a bargain. I definitely received more than I felt like I paid for. Food: I have to agree here that the food options could be better, but realistically they are unlimited with the kitchen and free shuttle to town. The new restaurant was stunning and delicious as well as a good addition to the resort. Room service had a great pizza and the market has fabulous pastries. With lunch poolside our meals were covered. Beach / Pool: We walked all the way into Playa and as far the other way and did not find any spectacular beaches until you came to town. However, the snorkeling on grounds makes up for the lack of easy ocean swimming. The pool in Phase I is heated and was never crowded. Both pools are in great condition and there was not a lack of lounge chairs or umbrellas. Service: We needed assistance on a flight issue from our conceirge and he was not at the resort that day. The sales desk located him and was able to assist us quickly. I couldn't complain about any member of the staff. Our room was spotless and cleaned with respect for our personal belongings. The grounds crew was always busy, but you did not notice them unless you looked. Diving: My husband is an avid diver and he was thrilled that the tours left right from shore at the resort. He was more than pleased with the clarity of the water, temperature, sea life, and professionalism of the dive masters. Spa: I receive at least one massage a month and this ranks in the top three that I have ever had. The facilities are underground and exquisite. The massuese was technical and what I thought was a bit high priced ended up being worth every penny. We will definitely be back to the Haciendas.

We were further back from the beach then I thought we would be. We were too far back to hear the waves etc. They had palm trees and a Pool Bar that also blocked our view of the ocean. We could still see the ocean though so it wasn't a major deal. Just had hoped our ocean view would be similar to what it was at other resorts where you were close enough to hear the waves all night. The Beach was WAY too rocky and rough for swimming. That was a big disappointment. I had heard if you walk down the beach a bit that i would find less rocky areas but that wasn't true. When we wanted to swim we took a cab into downtown playa del carmen and swam in the beaches there. The Two main restaurants at Royal Haciendas are horrible. One of them is right on the beach. They are both very expensive but the food quality is just pathetic. The Bar food was just so-so but was much more affordable then the other two onsite options. We hated that the Pool bar and grill shut down their kitchen at 5pm and closed the bar at 6pm. It would have been nice to spend an evening or two at the pool bar but apparently the resort wants to force you into one of their crappy main restaurants. They do have an onsite grocery store with prices that are okay. Fine print on the final bill says if you make any messes in your villa kitchen that you must pay a $75 fee. They have a small room service menu that is available until 10pm. The choices were mediocre and the prices somewhat high ($12 bucks for a plain hamburger) We quickly discovered that the food and ambiance was better at the beach near downtown Playa Del Carmen. This required daily taxi rides which costs 20 bucks round trip plus tips. We found a small restaurant on the beach in playa called Fusion and LOVED IT! When we checked into our room at the Royal Haciendas we were told we had a personal concierge. We only heard from that person twice. Once to confirm our timeshare presentation and a 2nd time to confirm that we had attended that meeting. There were no recommendations for things to do or places to eat. The timeshare presentation wasn't too bad. Just a bunch of dog poo about the value of the timeshare only going up and stuff like that. It only lasted 40 minutes.

Horribly noisy - woke me up every day with either somebody yelling into the microphone organizing activities, or the daily water aerobics instructor screaming out counts and blasting his music. Day one the pool bar music was also blasting, but we did complain to the front desk and that was turned down. Imagine having to listen to techno music as you are lying on the beach. Very disruptive to the relaxation we came there for. Everybody is assigned a personal concierge - who by the way - gets off at 5:00.....Ours was very non-responsive. Gave us curt, vague directions when asked....did as little work as possible, it seemed, and did not follow through on questions and problems. For instance, we had asked to be moved to Phase Two development which is in general quieter - but she never got back to us. I'm thinking a guest miserable because of noise is something to followup on. The workers at the resort are all very polite and greet you as you pass them. And there are many of them. However, none of them seemed to know where things were. I made two full laps of the property being sent in the wrong direction looking for the Gimnasio...Very frustrating. Speaking of which - 8 USD are charged for use of the gym. The shuttle to down-town is inadequate, as has been reported. The property is so far from downtown Playa that frequent shuttles should be offered - and certainly shuttles should continue during the evening. The lack of shuttle access seems to me to be representative of the lack of customer service at this property. Perhaps this is an attempt to keep guests on site for dinner - which brings me to the dinner buffets. First off - the waiters here are the hardest, most dilligent staff onsite (besides the gardners). They were wonderful. But the food was adequate at best, and very little effort was made to keep the salad bar options filled. There never seeemed to be any lettuce.....The drinks from the bar were also poor. We participated in some of the activities, which were more about the activities directors making noise than actually accomplishing something. There are activities from 8 - 4 each day. Some evening activities appeared - but were never advertised in advance. The entire property was a maze and it was very difficult to find out what amenities it had, where things were located, etc. There was no book in the room to share any information. There was a welcome orientation on Sunday, but with the two hour time difference, and after 20 hours of travel, we had hopes of sleeping - though that didn't turn out so well. The beach is rocky on the Phase One side - and the ocean was pretty rough. Phase two is sandier. All in all, I strongly recommend Phase Two if you are looking for relaxation. On the positive side, the pools are lovely. The bartenders and the swimup bar are fun for happy hour. It is quite lovely sitting in the warm pool towards the end of the day holding a drink. The property itself is pretty - but way too much concrete making it look rather stark instead of lush. And aside from a few birds, never saw a single living creature there....though even in our room we had plenty of gnats and mosquitoes. Would I stay there again? Yes - but not if there were other choices closer to town. A lot of hype - and not much delivery....", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cFabulous stay at Royal Hacienda!\u201d", "Author": "islaluvr", "ReviewID": "UR51234205", "Content": "My husband & I just returned from one week at Royal Hacienda.

What a fantastic experiance from the begining. We arrived at the Cancun airport and fought our way through the timeshare folks trying to give us a deal. It is best just to ignore them, We got outside and met with a Thomas Moore rep. We had made a reservation with Thomas Moore shuttle through the resort. The fare was $22.50USD per person. The ride was about 45 minutes and the shuttle had a total of 8 other folks going to the resort too. The shuttle fare was charged to our resort room. The resort offers a great exchange for USD to pesos. I recommend you exchange some money at the resort as they offer better rates than the exchange companies at the airport and downtown. You can use USD to purchase things in town and you get better rates at gift shops and souviner shops. We arrived at the resort and we're greated by the friendly staff. The resort had started to put up Christmas decorations and there was a nice tree up and we were greated by Santa inside. We checked in and were told that we were assigned a personal conciere. We went to our room, 1-bedroom with a kitchen. The room was very clean and spacious. The room had a full kitchen. The bathroom was big and had a big walk in shower with a hot tub located on a balcony outside the room, that overlooked the ocean. The bedroom had a King Bed and full closet with plenty of room. There was a TV in the bedroom and in the Living room. The resort was very nice and right on the beach, it was truly a 5 Star Resort. The resort had a big pool with a swim up bar (happy hour from 3PM-6PM). In addition, there was a lap pool. There are two resturants, one by the pool for casual dining and the other on the beach for more formal. We had the breakfast buffet one morning ($15 USD), worth the experiance. The other option was the resorts grocery store that has pretty much everything you can need at very competitive prices. We stayed away for lunch and dinner based on previous reviews here. The resort lead us right to the beach where there were plenty of palapas for guests to use (no charge). The water was calm and you could walk out about 100 yards and still be waist high. The resort is located about 20 minutes from town and the resort provides daily shuttle service into town. You need to reserve this the day before. The other option to get into town to take a cab, whcih is about 100 Pesos or $8 USD. The hotel has a list of taxi fares outside the lobby, which is fixed. We would normally take the shuttle into town for dinner and take a cab back to the resort. Overall, we had a wonderful time at the resort and will be coming back next year as one week was not enough. The best part was the resort amenities,the beach, the pool, happy hour, the service, and the fine dining in the town. The resort services such as the grocery store and exchangin money were a plus. You can spend the whole week there, but there is also plenty historical sites to see. We made it to Chichenitza ruins with an outside travel agency. Only areasfor improvement at the resort would be the travel company located there and the personal consigere. I do not recommend Thomas Moore, the travel agency inside the resort as they charge $99 USD per person for a tour of Chichenitza. We booked a trip through Odessey Travel for $45 USD per person. The company has a few locations through out 5th Ave (downtown). I will write a seperate review on them. The personal consigere was there for us from the begining. She gave us great dining recommendations, but she kept asking us to attend the resorts time share presentation. We agreed to attend, the experiance was ok, no high preasure like other Mexican resorts. We did not hear from her after we attended the resort. On the way home, we took a cab for 380 Pesos $30USD, which we reserved on our own. This saved us some $ instead if using Thomas Moore. All else was fine at the resort.

There are enough activities to keep yourself busy at the resort for a week without leaving. We took part in the salsa lessons, Spanish lessons, pottery and snorkeling. There isn't much of a nightlife so we took a cab to Playa del Carmen each night (100 pesos). The restaurant closes at 10:00 and the resort almost seems deserted by 9:00. We decided not to eat at the dinner buffet at the in house restaurant because of the price ($30) and ordered off the menu. The food was very bland, there was almost no flavor to it at all. The service was fast and professional but we decided to eat in town for the remainder of our trip. The rooms are spacious and clean. We slept through the night in the comfortable beds and the curtains kept all the light out in the morning to allow us to sleep in. All of the appliances and electronics are modern and in excellent shape. The beach was always clean and tidy. They have workers that rake the beach every morning. There was more than enough room for all the guests and we never had a hard time finding a place to sit. There is free snorkel rental available and the snorkeling just off the beach was full of fish and sea urchins. The snorkeling wasn't as good as Xel-Ha but it was great for being steps from our room. There were not many younger people at the resort as we had hoped. We noticed less than 10 people around their early to mid 30's. There were a few families and a lot of seniors.

I asked about snorkeling and ocean reefs and he advised the best snorkeling and reef on the whole coast was right in front of the Royal Haciendas. How could I say no. I agreed. We completed the process and he was very nice, telling me all about the beautiful villa with a large fully equiped kitchen, a large master bedroom with a private bathroom, 3 flat screen televisions with DVD players, a private balcony with sun beds, table and chairs, and a whirlpool tub for two on the main terrace. Sounded wonderful. He gave me the phone number for Thomas Moore Travel and advised I needed to call them within two weeks of traveling to make the arrangement for transport to and from the airport. THEN: He needed my CREDIT CARD NUMBER so he could complete the reservation. No problem. \"You are all set Mr. 'SMITH' and by the way, there is a $315 charge because this resort has higher rates the Sands.\" So now my free stay will cost $315. That's not so bad. When the time came to arrange transport, I called and found the airport transport would cost $150 for four people. Now my free week will cost $465. I was wondering what would be next. There was a death in the family and we had to cancel. \"No problem, Mr. Smith. We will hold your reservation in escrow and you can reschedule anytime in the next year and pay only a $50 rebooking fee.\" That sounded very nice. Maybe it was luck in disguise. I now know that only part of the resort was completed last year and the dirt and noise ruined the vacations of some of the guests. I wonder if that is why that kind young man wanted to switch me to the HACIENDAS so much. So here we are getting ready to go during the school break this month and I call and guess what. The reservation specialists hand me off to a seniorita that is laughing for 30 seconds when she picks up the phone and speaks almost no english and explains that THE SAME ROOM WILL COST YOU $1085 MORE THIS YEAR. Eventually I give up trying to understand her and speak to the booking manager BLAKE. The price is higher this year because 1) the prices have gone up and 2) last year my certificate was valued at a \"special promotion\" rate, this year since I am rebooking, I do not qualify for the \"special promotion\" rate. \"But it is a certificate for a weeks stay,\" I attempt to clarify, \"and you are the ones who put a value on it, not me.\" There us nothing we can do says BLAKE.

We own Marriott and traded this within our Interval International membership. This was our first -ever visit to Mexico. At first we were a little cautious due to the H1N1 (swine) flu outbreak, but from all the forums we read (especially TripAdvisor) this area really was not affected. And, as we found out upon arrival, this was true. Sadly, the economy there was severely affected by the bad publicity. After arrival at the airport, the obligatory health survey to say if you are or are not sick (and an occasional, random temperature check by the Health Officials) , and a LONG wait in line through Customs entry (a JOKE!) our group of 5 bought a bus ticket after hearing that the cab rides were not such a bargain. We discovered later that this was not true. In fact, after the bus took us to downtown Playa Del Carmen, we still had to take two cabs back to the resort for about $20 US. In the end, this (bus and cab combo) cost more than 2 cabs which only takes 4 passengers, or a van that can hold 6-7 passengers. Highly recommend taking the cabs for 4 or fewer and a van cab for bigger groups to and from the airport. The trip is direct and more convenient. For the \"fun of it\" we were hit-up by the timeshare salespeople near the airport's exit trying to set us up for a presentation. They offered to reimburse us for the bus we took, free taxi to and from the resort, provide free brunch (was GREAT!), bottle of tequilla, and some extra cash. We were also offered 2 free tickets and transportation to the Chitzen Itza Mayan Ruins, among other activities which we planned on going to anyhow. All the extra tickets were 1/2 the regular price. We took the bait knowing we would not be buying, we'd save money on the bus reimbursement, got a lot of extra's to boot, and how to handle these sales guys. We did the \"Tres Rios Resort\" tour. It was a really nice place, but no thanks since we already owned a beautiful Marriott timeshare in St. Thomas. Besides, they had no kitchen facilities there. You HAD to eat at their restaurants on property (inclusive). Getting back to Royal Haciendas, the place was clean, generally well maintained, very friendly staff (Isaac, our concierge was great, and always invited us to all the owners events). They didn't even TRY to sell us a tour and timeshare. We were so impressed by the place though, we probably would have bought a share there. We had to practically beg to have a tour/presentation just to learn something about the property aside from what we saw. While one of the pool areas was closed for renovations, it was not a hassle to go to the other one...this despite what someone had said about having to walk a LONG way to get to a pool. Going from one end of the resort rooms area to the pool area that was open could not have taken more than two whole minutes. Beaches were nice and clean. No pesky vendors either. There were plenty of activities on site offered by the resort...most free. ALSO, the resort has complimentary shuttles from the resort to Playa Del Carmen that run regularly all day. We took one to Playa, walked to the local WalMart for the week's worth of groceries, and then took it back. No cab needed! You just need to reserve a space for time of departure and expected return. We used this service two or three more times to visit Playa and their shops. The resort's restaurant(s) were good, but very limited. Very glad we had a kitchen in our unit to cook.

Flat screen Tv's in main area and in both bedrooms. Very nice grounds throughout the hotel. The activities are provided daily and subject to the interest of the guests. This was better some days than others. Happy hour from 3pm to 6pm allows plenty of opportunity to try many drinks without the all inclusive treatment. Drinks at times lacked alcohol. Restuarants are a little limted in the menu selection. Breakfest is ample. Mahi mahi wraps were awesome at the pool side lunch bar area. Other offering were just okay. New main restuarant is coming and will be a nice addition. One major complaint is the charge for refills on sodas. 2 sodas for 80 pesos. Please that is rediculous. It is hot and they should change this asap. Good pizza from take out. Also good desserts. Theme nights were sometimes better than other at La Palapa. Overall food was okay. Night around resort was peaceful and I personally enjoyed this. This resort sits far off the main road and is not friendly to catching buses. You basically need to take taxis to where you what to go. There is a shuttle to Playa De Carmen. Free internet in the room was a nice plus. Maid service daily besides Sunday was nice also.

Electricity went out while dining in the hotel restaurant. It took the staff 10 minutes to bring us a candle as we sat in the dark and couldn't see our food. They didn't even apologize for the power outage. 5. Asked the waiter how much the lobster was. He said 399 pesos. I ordered it. The bill was for 340 pesos so I sent the bill back. When he brought the revised copy it was for 395 pesos. Made me wonder if he was just pulling numbers out of nowhere. 6. My friend ordered a small bottle of water at the beach. The waiter brought her a large. 7. The resort book in the room stated the gym cost $5 USD per day. When we went to the gym, they charged us $8 USD. They said the new book wasn't printed, yet wouldn't honor the printed price, instead they posted a $8 charge sign at the gym. 8. After the electricity came back on, the cable television was still out...ALL NIGHT. 9. The water also went out one night. 10. The resort forces you to use your key card to bill everything to your room and you pay at check out. They do not allow you to use cash or credit card for any purchases at the resort. 11. My friend's key card would work in one area of the resort and not another. She spent over an hour in total waiting around for the staff to get purchases (drinks, dinner, etc) billed to the card/room. 11. There was vomit floating in the main pool. 12. Anyone has access to the resort, they don't make you wear bracelets like the other nearby resorts. So all the locals stay there and use the facilities free of charge. I realized this after seeing so many locals at the pool and then showering and changing in the bathroom at the end of the day (as opposed to doing this in the privacy of your rooom, if you were really a guest of the resort). 12. I think my patience level is pretty high. After the third day of these occurances, I decided enough was enough and it was time to complain to the Manager. The Manager did NOTHING to comp us for even a spa treatment to help relieve the stress that came from what was supposed to be a relaxing vacation. THIS PLACE IS NOT A 5-STAR RESORT..

So we had to walk a long ways with the kids past all the construction to use the pool,all activities and the beach. Good thing we didn't bring our parents, the long walks back and forth would have been too exhausting. We understand that they have to renovate their pool. We just wished that they had mentioned that the pool area would be temporarily closed on the web site as Resorts have done in the past.

All in all it is a solid resort but i wouldn't stay there again. We stayed at the resort about a month after the big \"swine flu\" scare and we anticipated that the resort would not be full. My frustration with the resort primarily revolves around its philosophy. In the wonderful reading materials in the room they have a book that essentially says the following...\"Royal Haciendas is a time share that is intended to be your home for the week. It is not a hotel and therefore there are big differences.....If you expect mild inconveniences, remember this is not a hotel....we are a not for profit facility and therefore if you don't get checked in right away we cannot offer you free nights stays...etc.\" The part that I want to point out is that the Resort is essentially giving you an excuse right up front and that philosophy is throughout. During out stay, our #1 inconveniece was our Concierge, Berto. When we walked in the front door, he wouldn't let us talk to the people standing there to check us in. He was trying to be helpful. He wanted to give us \"excellent service.\" He personally escorted us to our room and it was a real effort for us to get him to leave. He wanted to tell us about all of the wonderful restaurants around and all the activities that the hotel could do...etc. He then told us about the events that the resort had....i.e. a welcome party and a taco party...but unfortunately he forgot the invitations to these and would need to bring them back some other time. He also said the resort was 80% full this week, which was total BS. He told us that he would take care of our transportation from the airport and have this credited to our account. My wife and myself were going to scuba dive during the week and we already had our trips scheduled, but Berto wanted to help us with that too. Nice guy...but just a puppy you wanted to kick. Long story short, we never did get our invites and when he came up the next day we couldn't get him to leave again. He said that he would meet us the next day for breakfast and that the resort wanted to talk to us for a brief period, not pressure, about the timeshare program. When we went to meet our new buddy, he was not there but we were instructed to go to the members desk. The lady there wanted me to sign a piece of paper stating that I knew the timeshare presentation would be a full 90 minute commitment. No thanks...I will buy my own crappy breakfast. Our #2 inconvenience was the large pool close to our room that was closed because all of the water had drained from it when the pool settled. We were given a sheet of paper stating that these things happen and it was just a mild inconvience. Our #3 inconvenience was all of the rocks at the beach/ocean that made running into the water a painful experience. I know you can't fight mother nature and win all the time, but they didn't even try to help. Our #4 inconvenience was the mid-week call stating that for $699 we could stay another week. You could find cheaper rates online for the same resort than what they were offering. What was good about the resort....#1...the rooms are beautiful. We had one of the smallest rooms and the tile work and furniture were wonderful. #2...the store downstairs is reasonable and has a great selection of food, booze, and gifts. #3...The resort staff at the pool and maintaining the grounds were very friendly. #4..Free Internet.

The staff was great...spoke english fairly well which helped with my broken spanish! The rooms are beautiful with all the amenities. Large bathrooms, granite tops, comfortable beds. I would think most, if not all, have an ocean view. The grounds are perfectly manicured with a lot of open spaces so it would never feel cramped even during the busiest times. The pools (2) are huge and each has a swim up bar/restaurant. There are two large kids pools as well so that would be great for families. There are 4 hot tubs that were not too hot which was nice since its almost 90 degrees there right now! Plenty of chairs so no need to fight for space. The beach was absolutely gorgeous and very large and you get the best of both worlds! There is tons of white sand! Tons of palapas for shade if you want it and no shortage of chairs! About half of the water has very nice sandy bottom for swimming and the waves were always around 2 feet...fun but not dangerous by any means! The other half has rocks and reef which made for fun snorkeling. Its not great snorkeling or anything, but the resort has gear you can use for free. They also have kayaks you can use free as well! The restaurants were all very good. There were basically two at this point: La Palapa is the main restaurant under a huge Palapa right on the water, and the Aqua Grill which is the pool bar/restaurant at each pool. There is a new seafood restaurant set to open this fall though. La Palapa does breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets (the dinners are themed like Mexican, Seafood, Caribbean) but you can order off a menu at any time as well. We had the breakfast buffet a few times and it was great with made to order omelletes and waffles and truly fresh juices. We had dinner there one night off the menu and it was also very good. The Aqua Grilles were also very good...we tried shrimp tacos (killer) and a mahi wrap (even better). The setting was great as you could get a little shade but still have ocean views. My only issue...and we knew this going in...was that it is a little ways out of town...too far to walk for sure. They definitely know this and provide a shuttle to PDC throughout the day. I wish it ran a little later into the evening, but it probably will as the place gets busier. The taxi was only $8 each way so it really was no big deal, but if you really like the nightlife, this place may be a bit quiet for you.

BEACH: Loved it: The beach is large with nice sand and a good area for swimming or playing. Nice palpas, bathrooms close by and waiters will service you. There are kayaks and snorkeling equipment. You can get as many towels as you need and people don't start saving chairs until 8 or so. Plenty of chairs. CHECK IN & STAFF: Pleasant check in and staff through out the resort. Arnoldo was a wonderful bellboy and helpful. FOOD: Only one restaurant in the resort. They will be opening a second soon. The buffet was okay. The hamburgers were large and yummy. The a la carte food was good. Salsa also very good. You can order food to go or be delivered. Prices were pretty good. Best bet - go to Playa del Carmen: Try Sur for steak (expensive), La Parillas for fajitas (awesome). Many to pick from in Playa. I was told to try Ten for a good inexpensive steak by a local but never made it. ROOM: We stayed in a B side (lock out) room. Our first room had a horrid smell of fumigation chemicals. It was so strong I would not sit in the room. The staff tried to fix the problem. After 5 hours without any change in the odor, the manager finally changed our room. The second room had a similar smell but less potent. However, the smell does not seem to be a problem on the A side of the villas. The beds and pillows are not very comfortable and the decor is a little rustic. The bathrooms and double sink are nice. The maid did a wonderful job everyday. POOLS: The pools are large and nice. One pool is heated so the water is not cold as many people complain about the at other resorts. There is a pool for kids, however, the large pools have a shallow area and you will find many kids in there. The pool is wonderful. There are 3 good size jacuzzis. We found the middle one to be the warmest, however, the temperature could be a little hotter. Unfortunately kids were often in them and would spill their drinks. Some kids would do flips in the jacuzzi. GROCERY STORE: Many things that you might need. Reasonable price but would recommend going to Wal-Mart in Playa to pick up most items including alcohol. TAXI: Taxi rides are negotiable. You can get a cab for 100 pesos to Playa or to the resort, which is about 7 dollars. Don't pay $10. To the airport it is about $35 for 2. Thomas Moore is $44 for 2.

For the first 15 or so I only stayed at hotels (Sheraton, Ritz, Hyatt, Hilton etc). While many of these are very nice they are not neccesarily affordable. About 10 years ago I was told about the Royal Resorts and have not stayed any place since. Every one of them is amazing- clean, friendly people etc. This was my first time at the Royal Haciendas but it certainly will not be my last. It seems that with every new resort, the Royal Resorts learn something new. They used higher end products (such as granite countertops) than at the Sands and the bathrooms are much better designed. If you are looking to rent just a lock-off you will be very happy with the room- they have mini \"kitchens\" and balconys. We stayed in a ground floor unit. I was a bit reluctant at first because I was concerned with a lack of privacy but the ground floor units are great. They are not actually at ground level but raised up a bit. You have a lawn area in front of your unit which is great if you have children. Just beware- the patio doors will lock behind you. A lesson I learned the hard way one very early morning. If you prefer a sunny balcony in the afternoon then try to get a unit in the D section as the B units are shady most of the day (at least in the winter months).

Here are some positive assets of the resort: - The rooms are nice. For me this is a big thing. I can't stand bad hotel rooms. But the rooms are nice, well kept and a good size. Each has a full kitchen or kitchenette (depending on the room you have) which is very helpful. Big tubs (can fit two), balcony, dvd players, safe, good closet space. You won't be disappointed - The grounds are well kept and the view is beautiful - They have shuttles that run Sun-Friday that takes you into Playa for FREE. But if you miss the shuttle it's about $8 american dollars or 100 pesos. Note the shuttle does not run all night and you must put your name on a list the day before to ensure you have a seat. However we never really had a problem. - There is a supermarket on the grounds so if you need to pick up something for the room you don't have to go far. The price is reasonable and you can either pay them direct or they will charge it to your room. - I met some wonderful people and enjoyed my experience there a lot Things that could be better at the resort: - The beds left our backs hurting almost everyday, so that wasn't fun. We could have called for extra padding, but we didn't and every day we suffered. However other people we spoke with didn't have this problem, so maybe it was just us. - There are only 3 restaurants there and this kind of sucked. You want variety and it doesn't have it. The food is just average. But usually we would go down to Playa at night so it wasn't a huge deal for us. - One side of the beach my boyfriend didn't like. But he went to the other side and found it pleasurable. - I felt like there should have been a little more to do there. Besides tanning and very little daily activities, if you didn't plan to go to Playa there would be NOTHING else to do. We knew this going down and we still had a wonderful time at the hotel and most of all in the town of Playa. I would go back and stay in the hotel again. The rooms were nice and to me that's important. I did enjoy the quiet time to relax so it didn't bother us at all. But go knowing that there is nothing to do there at night. Other things to note: - We used Thomas Moore travel to take us from airport to the hotel. It was very easy and they will charge it to your room. For two of us roundtrip it was $44 american dollars. - Don't exchange money at the airport. You will get a better rate at your hotel or in town. Our hotel exchanged our money at 13 pesos to $1 at the airport you will only get 10 pesos for $1 - Places we recommend to eat is Blue Lobster and La Parilla - Go take the timeshare tour at Adventura Spa Palace. We had the best time. We received a bag of goodies, a day pass to spend at the hotel (which is amazing) and they paid for 10 tour tickets. We saved about $300 because of this. It really was a good day for us. YES we spent 90 minutes of our time..but we got much much more in return. If you feel up to it, take the tour, you won't be disappointed. OVERALL...

The resort is full of stuff to do. The resort and the rooms are very clean. Our personal concierge was able to book our dinners in Playa and our beach messages during our stay. When we first arrived at the Haciendas we were taken by how beautiful the entry to the resort was. There were waterfalls and a large circular thatch roof entry with columns. We were told across the street is where the new luxury golf course will be breaking ground in the spring of 2009. We had arrived early which was around 12:15 p.m. and were greeted by the bell boy as soon as the van had stopped. We had pre registered on line and were checked in within 10 minutes of arrival. They have a nice size grocery store which is like shopping in America. They have tons of stuff like fresh fruit, all kinds of drinks, chips, pasta, under water cameras, and beach toys, etc, and we found out that we could have shopped on line to stock our fridge before arrival at no additional cost. The resort is very lush; full of water falls, streams, hammock areas, six pool areas, four large hot tubs, and restaurants. The room is large a little over 1,700 square feet, with open main living areas, kitchen, kitchenette, two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, as well as storage for luggage and a stroller. The kitchen includes solid granite counter areas, an island, and is fully stocked with utensils, dishes, cups, pots and pans. The vaulted living room includes a large ceiling fan, plasma TV, DVD player, stereo, and two murphy beds. The balcony includes a patio table with 4 chairs, two reclining patio chairs, as well as a corner located Jacuzzi tub with a tile surround. The water pressure for the Jacuzzi tub was amazing. it only took 2 minutes to fill up. The vaulted master bedroom includes a very nice king bed, a seating area for two, large ceiling fan, closets, desk, as well as an entertainment center with DVD player and TV. The master bathroom includes dual sink granite vanity top, as well as a large walk in tile shower. The additional bedroom includes two double beds, a seating area, a kitchenet, and a entertainment center with DVD player and TV, plus includes a full bathroom with a dual sink granite vanity top, a large tub with a tile surround. Note the room was big and very nice. The resort offers a breakfast meeting on Sunday which will provide you information with the resorts activities, diving, fishing, tours, as well as a free transfer into Playa Del Carmen which is nice. We took advantage of the welcome party, pi\u00f1ata party for the kids, as well as the snorkeling tour which is right off the resorts beach. I was amazed with the snorkeling tour. I had assumed it would be a waste of time, I was so wrong. They take you about twenty five feet past the buoys and we could see hundreds of little to large fish all over this reef. You have to do the snorkeling tour.

I won't repeat all the things already said - but I would like to summarize pros and cons. Pros: 1) Beautiful apartments, modern kitchens, large balconies with jacuzzi, wireless internet in the rooms, the best timeshare apartments we ever saw. 2) Big pool, heated at night, the beach has fine white sand, with palapas and chairs available all day, palm trees on the beach look very exotic. 3) Staff is amazing, customer service is top as with all Royal Resorts in Cancun. 4) The place is spotless - apartments, grounds, beach, everything is cleaned and cleaned and cleaned every second of the day. 5) Free shuttle to Playa del Carmen, although reservation are required and the last departure from resort is early - 1 pm - and the last return from Playa is early - 6 pm. Cons 1) The water at the beach is full of rocks but better than other places in Cancun (better than the Sands beach) and better than some other resort beaches on Riviera Maya itself. 2) This really depends on your taste, but for us, we are a couple in our 40's and it is too quiet for us - not many activities (for example at the Sands the atmosphere is much livelier). It is also pretty isolated, you have to get the shuttle to Playa or a cab for 10 dollars one way) to do something, and by the time you go to Playa and you come back, you can easily waste a half day. 3) The Air Conditioner is very noisy and we had tiny ants all over the kitchen. 4) The way they built the resort, with the U-shape units, the oceanfronts, which are very few (perhaps only 10-15% of the units are oceanfront), are very nice, but they block the view from all other units - we had the second best view in unit C317 right in the middle of Phase I, we could see the ocean between the buildings from a far distance, but it doesn't really make it to a true ocean view. Many units won't even get a glimpse of the ocean. Overall, we may return to this resort when we plan to spend a week doing nothing but sleeping, having peace and quiet, and enjoying the sun and beach (with most swimming being done in the pool). We recommend it for retired travelers but not for teenagers, young people who like the night life (unless you are willing to commute to Playa back and forth).", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Smithtown, New York", "Title": "\u201cSolid Resort, not Spectacular\u201d", "Author": "Czymnzo0", "ReviewID": "UR21502044", "Content": "Having been to the Carribean, Cancun to be exact, I was excited to head south for a little Mayan Riviera hospitality. I thought Cancun was beautiful, the beaches wonderful, and the entertainment endless. The trip from the airport is about 45 minutes, give or take, and we were happy to finally hit our destination. The outside of the resort is gorgeous, with the grounds around the hotel lush and extravagant. Your first notice of the hotel will be how undeniably clean and spotless it is. The appreciation I have for Royal Resorts and their interest in keeping the resort so clean has really put them a bar above most resorts. I will break this review down into three sections from here: The Rooms, The Resort itself, the Beach. The Rooms: The rooms are spacious. Each room has a wonderful full balcony out of the first main room, and a half balcony that extends out of the guest room. There is also a hot tub which was used frequently may I add. There was 6 of us, so me and my girlfriend were stuck to the beds that came down from the walls in the main room. I have to be blunt, they are the most uncomfortable beds I have EVER slept on. For a Royal Resort with immaculate grounds, above average service, to sleep on these concrete walls were really a damper in our week. We had no other choice, so we had to make the best of it. We alternated between the beds and the couch, but my back still took a beating. The other rooms have much better beds, so don't panic. All the rooms are equipped with marble, a half kitchen, and beautiful decoration. You definitely receive the bang for the buck here at the Royal Resort - just expect a rough week if your one of the unlucky people who have to sleep on the pull down beds. You've been warned. The Resort itself: You can't deny how beautiful the resort is. It really is lush, with beautiful scenery, plants, bridges, waterfalls. The resort has two HUGE, BEAUTIFUL pools. This was my favorite part of the Royal experience. The pools are kept mild to warm, they are HUGE. The resort during Oct 4 - 11 was crowded, but not once did you feel it with these pools. Each pool has a swim up bar. Just beautiful. Couldn't have been happier with the pools. Also, there are two lap pools where \"Volleyball\" was held each day. Great fun! Met a lot of couples through volleyball and beach volleyball that we hung out with for the week. Solid job here Royal. As for activities themselves, there are not many at the hotel. Each day, the resort holds activities. For instance, one day there was Texas Hold Em in the lobby. A fun experience, but very short, which kept us from returning. There are not many other things to do, so keep that in mind. This resort should not be chosen for activities. There is only one \"true\" restaurant. It can become quite tiresome, but the plus here is that the waiters remember your likes, your needs. Everyday, they would have orange juice waiting for me and my girlfriend because they knew we loved it. Just awesome! The Beach: Here is where the resort drops in a huge way. I am a beach connoisseur, I travel to the Caribbean for the spectacular beaches. I love to swim, staring at your feet, wading in the blue water. Well, here at the resort, the beach is terrible. It's so below average that it was such a let down. First, the beach has rocks everywhere. For the famed Mayan Riviera, Royal HAS to fix that problem. You cannot have rocks everywhere on the beach. Next, there is coral everywhere in front of the beach. They say you can snorkel, which we did, but most of the coral is dead. Why it is not removed, well, I'm not sure. So there are no areas to swim, and the water never reaches that \"clear, Caribbean\" level. We tried walking about a half mile in each direction and we could not find swimmable beach. Believe it or not, this is why I will not return to the Royal Haciendas. You cannot have such a pathetic beach at such a beautiful resort. We went to Cozumel three times during our visit so that we could swim at beautiful beaches. You may have to do the same. Overall: The hotel is solid. It is beautiful, ornate, and spectacular with service. But that does not do enough in the eyes of this traveler. I rarely have anything bad to say about a resort, as you should expect some problems. But having such a terrible beach is not a problem I should breeze by. Many people come from around the world, EXPECTING a top beach, not asking. Many people complained, and Royal said they are doing there best. The resort should not have been built on a coral reef with no life. A real draw back, and for me I will visit another resort during my visit to Playa Del Carmen. 7/10. Enjoy yourself, it's impossible not too. Just don't be too upset when you look at the beach. It is not your typical Caribbean beach, I view this hotel as an exception to otherwise gorgeous beaches.

The service was above average and the help at the resort was very friendly. I had a fun afternoon playing beach volleyball. We got to experience things we normally wouldn't do staying further South from Cancun. We took a ferry to Cozumel and went shopping and had lunch at the smallest Hard Rock Cafe in the world. We too a road trip to Tulum and got to experience The Ruins on the Caribbean. We visited Cenotes Azules and it was quite an experience (recommend a heavy coating of mosquito repellent!). We spent a lot more time in Playa Del Carmen than we have on previous trips too Cancun. We had a nice lunch at La Parilla and an entertaining dinner at Carlos & Charlies in Playa. My wife Marta and brother-in-law Jose Parasailed right off the beach where we were staying. They caught a ride out to the boat on Jet Skis.

We also went to La Casa de Agua. Views were great (of the streets- not ocean) and we wanted fish and they said it was frozen. Who has frozen fish in Mexico. The Blue Lobster brings you 5 different lobster tails and each one has a price and a weight. They were caught within 24 hours of serving to us. That is the way we like it! My husband did a fishing trip through Thomas Moore Travel. Though Mario was very nice, the picture of the boat that Mario showed my husband was not at all the boat that he actually went out on. The picture was of a brand new boat and what they went on was a 50 year old piece of junk. They would not let him fish until the lines had actually caught something and then they would let the guests real the fish in. Not quite the fishing experience he was looking for but he did catch a huge grouper and the hotel rest. was nice enough for a fee to cook it for us for dinner. It is a very large resort but not too many people. We never felt overcrowded. The beaches were beautiful. You were never approached by anyone. They had a guard posted on the beach 24 hours a day to keep strays away. All in all it was great. Carlos at the swim up bar was the best bartender and Eduard in the restaurant for breakfast was the best waiter. Jorge the bar manager at the swim up pool was extrememly knowledgable in tequilla if you are interested. What a great guy! Please be aware that construction is still going on and am not sure for how much longer. They were doing work at the pool when we were there and it was hard to relax. Enjoy and have a great time.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Royal Experience\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoHefe", "ReviewID": "UR19355586", "Content": "My wife and I along with our eleven year old daughter traveled to the Royal Haciendas on August16-23. We bought a time share there last year and this year was the first time we got to use it. All in all we had a great time but there was one big bump. Here is what happened: When we arrived at the airport in Cancun a Thomas Moore shuttle was waiting for us which we arranged to have a couple of weeks earlier. The ride was comfortable and uneventful. When we arrived at the Haciendas the people at check in said that we were not on their list of arrivals and that they did not have our villa available. To make a long story short, Interval international, the vacation club we belong to, made a mistake and exchanged our whole villa and not just the B side like we had arranged previously. The front desk was not very helpful and basically told us to call interval international and deal with it because it wasn't their mistake. I not so politely disagreed stating that we were Royal Resort members and purchased our villa for a lot of money and they should also try to sort this mistake out. We then went to the time share sales office and talked to the lady we purchased our time share from and they came up with a solution promptly however this whole incident took four hours. The resort itself was beautiful. Much nicer landscaping than any of the other royal resorts. Beautiful ponds filled with plants and wildlife dot the area along with a magnificent pool. Very comfortable hammocks are placed all over and the place is immaculately clean. The rooms are very much like the Royal Sands but newer and with a mexican theme. The A-side has a nice size kitchen with granite counter tops, an oven, refridgerator, coffe machine, microwave, and anything else a kitchen needs. The master bedroom has a lot of closet space with a kingsize bed and opens up to a big patio that has a jacuzzi on it. The villa is fully furnished and very spacious and comfortable. The restaurants were good. My favorite was the Aqua Grill which is located next to the pool. The hamburger from here was big and really juicy and the fried grouper sandwhich was awesome. The main restaurant was by the ocean and looked like a giant palapa. It had an amazing view of the ocean but we only ate there for lunch which was a decent buffet. Never woke up for breakfast so I dont know how it is. Room service was good with pizzas, salads, hamburgers, roast chicken and a variety of other things on the menu. There is a nice stretch of beach on this resort but there is a section with a lot of rocks so beware. There are two huge pools with nice pool bars and there are also two lap pools and two kiddy pools. You can kayak and snorkle for free but there is a fee for jet skiing. There is also a shuttle that takes you into and out of Playa del Carmen for free. Playa del Carmen had an awesome night life and an endless array of restaurants both expensive and authentic, inexpensive, local cuisine. Playa del Carmen is only about seven minutes away by motor vehicle. Great place for a family to relax and enjoy themselves in comfort. The service was awesome, the drinks were great, the food was good and the excursion selection from Thomas Moore was nice. This place is about an hour closer to Xcaret, Xel-ha, Tulum and other excursions than Cancun is and that was nice. Taxis service was more regulated here with a fixed price into Playa del Carmen. If you are looking for authentic inexpensive Mexican food go to the El Fogon right by the Huge store called Mega. La Carboncita right off of fifth ave. was great also with good tacos al pastor and unbelievable caldo de pollo. Cueva del chongo had great scenery and very fresh Mexican food also. There is also a Mayan restaurant called Yaxche that was very nice also.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wallingford, PA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort But...\u201d", "Author": "jmyersrw", "ReviewID": "UR18721674", "Content": "The resort's grounds are beautiful and the property is kept immaculate. The construction is still going on but it is not intrusive at all. The beach and ocean are pretty to look at but the ocean is NOT swimmable. This is the main reason I would never return. There is some rock but the problem is the sea life. It is good for beginning snorkelers but there is no place to swim! I chose this resort and location over Cancun because I know the damage the Cancun beaches sustained from the hurricane a few years back. I would have gone elsewhere if I had known the ocean at this property was such a disappointment. They told me they just received permission from the local government to clear out some of the rock but I don't see how that will help them. Other positives include 2 large swimming pools with swim up bars, an onsite restaurant with different nightly buffets, outside dining at lunch. These are pluses since I am used to Marriott timeshares without onsite restaurant facilities other than poolside lunch service. The prices are also very inexpensive. Dinner buffet $25 pp and 5 drinks at the bar (4 nonalcoholic and 1 alcoholic) was $11.00. The service is slow but very friendly. Almost all of the staff speak English but there is some difficulty communicating. The concierge is helpful but only to a point, once they know you are not buying at their resort. She gave us bad advice on what beaches to go to for swimming and later after we wasted our day said she realized she probably told us the wrong thing! Some other points to consider: There is no laundry in the villas. There is a laundry facility that is staffed but it can be difficult to get an available washing machine. You also have to be back at a required time to put the clothes in the dryer. This may not seem like a big deal but one of the things I love about timeshare villas other than the extra room for my 3 kids (16, 12, and 10) is being able to do laundry. Not having it in the villa, wasted many hours of my vacation walking back and forth but of course not a huge deal in the big picture. The bar and onsite store close at 10 so there is virtually no nightlife. I would rate the resort a 6 overall. Talking to many people after returning home, the beaches are swimmable at other resorts nearby so choose carefully.", "Date": "August 7, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Royal Haciendas Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d651166-Reviews-The_Royal_Haciendas_Resort-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$115 - $292*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Cancun-Chetumal Highway km 289+10</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "651166", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b1/35/b13540862a9df236a08c7cdd37f961146large.jpg"}}
