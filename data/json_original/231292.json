Biggest plus is the hotel's location with all major attractions within walking distance. Vatican is best reached by bus though. No 64 from via nationale nearby. Walking distance from Termini railway station. No need for Taxi. Get Leonardi Express from the airport. 30 mins non stop and 14 euros for a single journey. Staff from the hotel were helpful and pointed out the main sites on arrival on a map. Room was very clean and had been recently refurbished with flat screen tv and new carpet. Bathroom a good size with modern fittings. Also a separate dressing room. Room was not huge but more than adequate. Only slight criticism was a very hard bed and pillows! Not a reason to avoid though. Room was cleaned to a very high standard. My wife and I thought the breakfast was really good. Good selection of rolls, fruit , yoghurts , meats etc. Some hot food being scrambled egg, frankfurter sausages and continental bacon. Tea and coffee on tap. Set us up for an energetic days sightseeing. In summary, a good value hotel in a safe area of Rome which is in a pretty much perfect location to visit all the sites. Couple of tips, if you can afford it, get a guided tour of the Vatican. Will help avoid the queues and makes the visit so much more interesting. Inside of the coliseum well worth seeing. Audio tour very good for about 6 euros. We loved Buiding known as \"the wedding cake\". Straight down via nationale. You will come to it. Take elevator to top. Great views of Rome. Relaxing cafe. A wonderful city.

The room we stayed is was compact but not cramped, with a bathroom running off it.(no bath) this was made up beautifully everyday by very attentive maids. Our shower leaked/flooded out bathroom dispite our best efforts with the doors to keep the water in,, this made trips to the loo a bit damp underfoot until the room was cleaned next day. We backed onto a court yard so there was very little noise and the window opened providing a pleasant breeze. The room did have air conditioning but did not cool at this time of the year. Disappointing as no tea & coffee making facilities. TV channels not to our liking.................ok if you want the news 24/7. Breakfast was a selection of meats/croissants/cereal toast etc so not for the guys who want a hearty full english however a short walk will provide one. Reception manned 24 hours with polite proffessional staff. The Hotel is 15 mins walk form the main station & maybe 5/10 max to the metro. The metro offers an easy & efficient mode of transport & for 4 euros each you can travel for 24 hours, fab for nipping to the Spanish Steps, the Collesium the Trevi Fountain etc. Whatever you do, do not visit Mr Chows chinese restuarant around the corner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wi-fi is charged at a reasonable rate of \u20ac5 for 3 days BUT, this will only allow one device onto the network so if you have two iPhones etc only one will connect at a time. So either pay again or log in and out. The breakfast is good with a decent selection - a hot option of some kind would have been welcomed though. It was nice to be able to get a decaff coffee and the breakfast room itself was pleasant and well lit. Other areas of the hotel could do with minor maintainable - wobbly handrails, awkward to flush toilet etc but overall it's nothing too off putting. ALL the staff were friendly and helpful and, unlike some Corfiot hotel owners, you never felt like you were being hassled to take a tour they got commission from and so on...

When we got there we joined the queue of people to check in - only to be told that there was no more room at that hotel and we had been placed into another hotel - but we had to pay the Hotel Virgilio upfront as they had reserved the other hotels. We were as sceptic as the other travellers in the queue and all thought it to be a con, but we all decided to go along with it as it was now 9pm, we were hot and tired and getting desperate! Several of the travellers had been booked into a hotel 3km or more away but, luckily, ours was closer. We got a taxi to the Hotel Fiamma (near the station!) and stayed the night. In the morning, we had to check out by 11am and go back to the Hotel Virgilio We desperately tried to stay at the Hotel Fiamma to avoid the disruption of moving but were told that we couldn't. So off we trot to the Hotel Virgilio, left our luggage and came back later in the day when the room was ready. We stayed the one night - the breakfast was not good and not worth their normal rate of \u20ac80 a night - half of what we had paid! Basically, they profiteered from travellers in distress and didn't look after us but shunted us from one hotel to another.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cNo problems here.

Coming from America where we are very particular when it comes to \"ratings\" and \"expectations\" , I found this hotel to be a great choice for the leisure traveller such as myself. So since I am planning to return to Rome later this year (December), I thoght I would look up this hotel again. I cannot recall having a bad experience at this hotel. I must admit though I was taken back a little when I had to pay the full cost of the room up front. But that was a minor thing considering I knew I had to pay the amount anyway. The staff was friendly and provided me and my friends with any information we needed to enjoy our trip. They suggested restaurants and other locations that may have been of interest to us. The room was clean and big enough for the 3 of us. With one bed as you enter the room and 1 larger or 2 additional beds down the hall. The location of the hotel was perfect for sight seeing, shopping and walking to major attractions. I think people need to realize that they can do more research for before travelling to find the best options for them. Like someone said, the hotel is less than a 10 minute walk from the train station. So it is just as easy and maybe takes less time to catch the train from the airport than a cab. I have travelled to several international locations around the world. Most being European locations. And it took me little time to realize that what we as Americans would call a 2 star hotel, maybe considered a 3 or 4 star hotel in Europe. So I know if I want luxury and top service I should stay at a major chain hotel and spend the money for it. But I do not always want that when I travel. I want to stay at a hotel that is clean, safe, reasonable in price and in a location that is close to the things I want to do. I have a family member that works for a major hotel chain, so I could get a room for a fraction of the cost of the regular room rate. At times my rate would be less than the rate of the hotel I select to stay in.

This was the only hotel on our 5 week Europe trip that asked for payment upfront, and it didn't take long to see why. Tiny room (even for Europe), carpet not vacuumed, stains on bedspread, wardrobe doors didn't close properly, the wallpaper is peeling off in places, and the lift broke down at least once during our 3-night stay. After one night we asked to move to another room because the bed was too small and we were told it was a standard double bed and that all the rooms were like it. When we pushed the matter, we were offered another room but when we looked at it, the room and bed were exactly the same. The staff were unsympathetic and uncaring, and the poor girl running breakfast in the morning (who did a great job) received no help from the male staff around her, they seemed more content ordering her to do something else than actually lifting a finger to help. There was nowhere to place luggage in the over-furnished room (wardrobe, desk, chair, bedside table and another chair all along the hallway). Bed was too small for two people; my husband's feet hung off the end of the bed (he's only 5'11\" in height), my toes could reach the end of the bed (I'm only 5'3\"), and the bed only fit 1 1/2 pillows across. Window did little to shut out the noise of the restaurant across the street, and the walls were so thin you could hear people talking or watching TV in the next room which made for three very sleepless nights. Air conditioning worked well, though no controls in the room. Bathroom was clean and toiletries provided, and the shower pressure was good. The breakfast was ordinary at best. The breakfast room was tiny - not enough room for the number of guests, and all the breakfast was set up on one table so everyone had to reach over each other as they collected their breakfast. They offered bread and croissants (which were stale), cereal (either coco pops or sugared corn flakes), freshly made coffee to order, juice (sour grapefruit or miscellaneous fruit drink), yoghurt, boiled eggs, cheese, salami, ham, a variety of packaged items (salted biscuits like premiums, toast biscuits, cream cheese, butter and jams). Nothing was fresh except the coffee. We were aware that European breakfasts are generally not hot and quite light, but this wasn't even fresh. It's only redeeming feature was its location. Close to the main Roma Termini (approx. 10 minutes with luggage) and you can walk to all the major attractions (Coliseum and Roman Forum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Spanish Steps, perhaps not the Vatican City) easily.

The advantage of being so close to one of the main streets in Rome afforded convenient acccessibility to the bus routes and within walking distance of the metro at Piazza Republica. The location of the hotel also meant that you did not have to suffer any of the traffic noise that is usually experienced when situated directly onto a main road. The hotel itself was small and intimate. The staff were extremely friendly and efficient and spoke excellent English. The rooms were typically small for a city centre hotel but exceptionally clean with daily maid service. There was a safe in the room, suprisingly enough, you did not have to pay for the use of the safe key. My only criticism was the breakfast which consisted of rice crispies or cornflakes and milk, a bread roll with butter or preserve and a croissant. Drinks were juice, water, tea or coffee. This offering did not deviate for the 4 mornings we were there. Suffice to say after the second morning we made alternative arrangements in one of the many cafes surrounding the hotel. Rome was everything I expected it to be and more. I found the `Romans` generally helpful and friendly - a real contrast to the residents of Milan. Be prepared for an awful lot of walking - you will not see everything but if you plan for the sites you want to see and use the public transport system wisely - you will not be disappointed. A word of advice - all the literature about Rome will advise you about pickpockets. Having visited various cities across Europe and America, I would regard myself as quite cautious and sensible about my belongings, but Rome was something else, the excessive amount of people using the buses and metro system provide the crafty pickpocket with ample opportunity to steal your belongings as my partner experienced on our second day into the visit. Upon reflection, the theives worked in pairs, were very well dressed and extremely good at what they do. Fortunately, they only got away with about 50 euros as we had placed everything of worth in our hotel safe. Do not let this deter you from using what is otherwise a really efficient and quick way of getting around the city. The friendlieness of the other citizens of Rome restored my good opinion of the city and its residents. To experience a real Roman trattatoria, visit the Est Est Est across the road from the hotel. The Pizzas are to die for and the service was second to none. Finally, I would advise you to use the audio guides wherever possible as there is such a lot of information for the tourist to take in - audio guides are relatively inexpensive but main attractions such as the Collesseum, Roman Forum and Vatican Museum require you to provide identification i.e. passport, ID card, or a credit card. My advice would be for you to take something that you can use as ID but not of any real value.

The towel warning was right on; the towels were rough and more like napkins. My major complain was the elevator. It was very small to begin with, and you can barely fit two people with luggages. On our first night in this hotel, the elevator was skipping the ground floor, moving straight from basement (where the breakfast room was located) to 3rd floor (where most of the guests were staying since it was off season and only the 3rd floor was in use). After it skipped the ground floor for the third time, we decided to go down to basement to catch the elevator. Once we were inside the elevator, the door opened in between floors! And when it reached 3rd floor, the elevator stopped but the door didn't open. After about 10 seconds, the lights went off. Imagine getting stuck in the tiny elevator in total darkness! We stayed calm and pressed the alarm for assistance. We weren't in the elevator for that long, may be for 5 minutes or so, but the experience was definitely not what we had in mind. When the elevator started working again, it went straight down to the basement again. We stepped out of the elevator, glad that nothing major happened, and kindly asked the front desk if we could take the stairs instead. They told us there were no stairs to the 3rd floor (??), and our only option was to get back into that elevator. It took us a while to get the courage to step into the elevator again, but we finally managed to get back into our hotel room. We stayed a total of 3 nights in this hotel, and nothing happened again on the 2nd or 3rd night. If they didn't make us paid for the 3-nights up front, I would probably considered switching to another hotel.", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cWorth returning\u201d", "Author": "bordercrossing", "ReviewID": "UR6024948", "Content": "The hotel is centrally located.

We have stayed in hotels all over Europe and have never been asked to do this. Perhaps they have had some early departures so now they charge everyone in advance--I do not know. Second, the primary criteria was that the hotel have Air Conditioning--they assured us that it did. If it was present, it was not effective--our room never dipped below upper 80s F (lower 30s C). One helpful staff member told me that this happens on the third floor sometimes--but no apology or alternative. Then we were told to just leave the AC on all day and it would cool down. When we returned the maid had turned it off. The third day we asked the maid to leave on the AC but she said she had strict orders to turn it off and I would have to speak to the manager (owner?). I did this and he said it would be left on...we returned and it had AGAIN been turned off. Again, we have lived in Europe for over 2 years and stayed in many European hotels--never have we experienced anything like this. Third, breakfast was adequate but not always fresh. The juice was watered down and the coffee was luke warm. Oddly, there was a sign, only in English, not to take juice out of the breakfast room. Fourth, we had a junior suite and one room had a burned out light so reading was not possible. It took a day and a half to get the light bulb changed.
