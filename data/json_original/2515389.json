Plusses included the continental breakfast with muffins, bagels, fresh fruit, yogurt, juice, milk, coffee and tea, the pleasant staff, the housekeeping service and most of all, the value. We needed to stay in West Seattle, and this is the only hotel in the area. We had read some of old reviews and were a bit concerned, but we didn't need to worry. It has been recently redecorated. The furnishings are spartan, but it's got just about everything you need. Ours was a long stay, so my wife fussed they didn't have a dresser for storing flat clothes, but they say they are going to add those, soon. When we stay in Seattle, we usually stay in the North end to be close to family members, but I will consider coming back.

The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The heat is controlled with controls for baseboard heaters, that was difficult to control the temperature. We opened the window to try and cool the room down but struggled with some noise outside. The bathroom is large enough for 2 to be in comfortably. Kitchen area and living room huge.

In early November, we turned the heater on upon arriving at about 10pm but after about 30 minutes without noticeable change, we called the front desk. Their comment was that \"it takes about an hour to warm up.\" We did at least notice the register getting warmer so put our coats on the bed and, by the time we woke up, the room - which was a double - was warm. We were there again the next month - new grandbaby! - and wanted to try a King room. This time, as we were driving up at night from Oregon, when we were about an hour away we called and asked them to turn on the heat in our room. Which they did. The register was a little warm when we got into the room but the King room was much larger to heat and had a large window along one wall. We again put coats on the bed, the room never really warmed up and my husband says he's felt cold ever since. The rooms were still clean, the staff helpful and the rates very reasonable. HOWEVER, if you're there in the winter try staying in a smaller room and call ahead to get the heat turned on if you're arriving late. There should at least be blankets in the rooms. And why couldn't they turn the heat on at a minimal temperature for the rooms that are rented? This is still the only decent hotel in West Seattle, which is a great location to both the airport and downtown. Despite these experiences, we'll go back. I hope they'll continue to make improvements.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood no-frills cheap hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jdawg5555", "ReviewID": "UR120867748", "Content": "There's nothing great about the location or the hotel itself, other than they did upgrades to the room and the bedding is very comfortable.

We made a reservation in advance and specifically asked for a quite room in the back wing away from Alaska Street. Instead, when we checked in at 5 PM on a Satruday night, they gave us room 201, right on hte corner of Alask and a side street. Arguably, the noisiest room there was. The rooms are nicely appointed, though the lack of a door between the sink area and the toilet/shower seemed a bit weird. Anyway, the bus noise was loud while it lasted, and quieted down about 10 PM. Traffic resumed about 7 AM, so don't expect to sleep in here in the upstairs corner bungalow. The breakfast area is small, nice and offers a fairly healthy choice of cold foods.

Perhaps we should have kept it on all day while we were gone. Double beds. Continental breakfast was typical - cold cereal, small pastries, juice, bagels and bread. We had minimal contact with staff but they seemed cordial enough. It's not the best neighborhood for walking at night but there's a grocery store about 2 blocks away and shops/restaurants within a few minutes' drive.The wake up call worked and that always makes me nervous.

This is NOT AT ALL how it looks on the internet! There were broken windows, filth and garbage everywhere and in a really BAD part of town. We did not feel safe or that our vehicle would be safe for the night. The manager was hostile and rude and dumped everything on the poor girl working the front desk. When we arrived there was a long line of people (two couples leaving because they were not comfortable staying there). We all started talking as we waited there for over 45 minutes together for the manager to come back and help us. It turned out that two sets of people, after booking rooms, found out that they did not have rooms. The Grove told them that they were contacting another hotel to secure a room for them but finally one family called the other hotel and was told that no one had contacted them from The Grove. There was a big fight about the Grove lying and the manager (Joey) literally hid and would not come out (as the poor front desk girl was calling him asking him what to do) he was saying that he had to install a TV in another room. His teenaged son came out and was rude and told everyone \"My dad is busy he will get here when gets here!\" The whole thing was a nightmare and a total waste of time and money.
