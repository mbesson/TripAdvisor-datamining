Just a few blocks from Union Station and the Sears / Willis Tower. Booked this hotel through Priceline and got an OK deal. I've had better deals in the past, but with priceline, it all depends on general availability during your desired stay. This was early December, on a Saturday night, so who knows... Again, have had better deals, but this was OK. Either way, I would not have any hesitation regarding this hotel and would stay here again. The rooms were set up for couples or business people w/ one queen bed. Also had a desk, chair and flat screen TV. The room was clean and very comfortable and will meet the needs of most \"non-family\" travelers. The rooms are on the smaller side, however, but are nicely decorated. You would not want to try to \"squeeze in\" kids in any way. The bathroom is smaller too, with a stand-up shower (no tub) and a single sink. There is a restaurant on site which is connected, but not associated with the hotel. The restaurant is part of the Elephant & Castle chain. Good selection of pub type food and beer. Parking is $35 for valet with in/out privileges, however it takes about 15-20 mins. for them to get your car pulled around. There is public parking decks w/i 2 blocks that charge $25 for 24 hours. I think the hotel valet uses one of these lots as their \"base\" which would explain why it takes them some time to get your car.

They use an automated system which you insert you credit card into which finds your booking. It only takes 2 minutes and you are issued with a card key. Room - I had a small Queen room.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very good value in a fantastic location, but there are also a few things you should know about. First, the Pro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Great value, considering the rates in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Loop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd area of Chicago. I paid $99/night. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The location is perfect for exploring downtown. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right between the Art Institute and the Willis (formerly Sears) Tower. There are multiple restaurants and services within easy walking distance. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Free bottled water. The hotel really seems to take the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd theme seriously. There are empty water bottles on each floor with purified water dispensers for you to use as much as you want. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The furnishings are relatively new and nice. Not overly luxurious though. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re somewhere between a Best Western and a Westin. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 There are free computer workstations to use for printing out boarding passes (see note in Cons though) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The hotel itself is very secure. Key cards are needed to operate the elevators as well as enter your room. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The attached Elephant & Castle Pub. Very good food. Not a huge menu, but what there is is very good. Plus you get your room service from there. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Free large chess sets in the lobby and lounge. Cons: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No safe in the room. This was a biggie for me as I had camera equipment I would have put in there. I asked the front desk about whether they had safe deposit boxes for use. They said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, we can, umm, rent them or let you use them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Not overly confident. When I pushed further, they said they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean rent, they meant just use. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use them though as their answer didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t inspire confidence. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Free wireless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is exceptionally slow. I was there for 5 days (4 nights). Some days it was just okay and others it was virtually unusable. Note: The front desk was once again no help in troubleshooting any issues either: The in room instruction card tells you what network to join, but what it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you is that you need to open your browser (Safari, etc) and accept their terms and conditions every 24 hours to have access. It will look like you have a strong signal, but you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to access it until you do that step. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The free computers to print boarding passes can also be excruciatingly slow. We tried for over an hour to print 3 boarding passes. We got 2 printed then finally gave up. Each web page was taking 2 minutes or more to load, then often failed and we had to restart at the beginning. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if this was temporary or what, because the wireless that night was also super slow. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 There is only one ice machine in the hotel. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to go to the 3rd floor to use it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The lowest category rooms (standard rooms) are VERY small. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m talking cruise ship small. The bathroom was so small that when I sat on the toilet my knees were under the sink. No, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not kidding or exaggerating. My friends had both the next room category up, plus one had a suite. They were larger and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely recommend going for the higher categories (although the suite really isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a suite as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all one room) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No refrigerator in the lowest category rooms. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No fan in the bathrooms \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 No movie channels of ANY kind (HBO, Showtime, PPV (of any kind)) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Valet parking only, and the valet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know any restaurants in the area, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask them. So the bottom line is whether I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay there again. The answer is yes, but only in one of the higher category rooms and only if there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a hotel in that general neighborhood that had safes in rooms with a similar price. Tip: Your GPS probably won't work to get you to the hotel once you're nearby with all the tall buildings nearby. Be sure to have printed directions or a map.

I had a question about my bill (since the receipt didn't match my hotels.com reciept). The receptionist basically told me a bunch of prepared statements, and when I asked her what that meant, she didn't know, and I would have to contact hotels.com. Gee, thanks. PARKING: be careful. The self-park is two blocks away. Not a long walk, until you have to make it 3 times. When you check out, make sure to have the receptionist validate your parking ticket. They didn't mention anything, and when I got to the garage, it was over 1 and a half times the price you pay with validation. So I had to walk back, and then back again.

At first we were given keys to a room that would not open. We had to go back downstairs. They assigned us to a different room. We believe that they actually sent us to a room that was already in use! As we were walking in the hallway to the room, I jokingly told my husband that it seemed that the side of the hallway that our room was on felt like it was an interior room and wouldn't have windows. Unfortunately, I was correct. Instead it had two large skylights by the doorway. (The original room we were assigned to would have had windows!) There was a control on the wall for blinds on the two skylights, but unfortunately it only moved the blinds for one of the skylights. The rest of the room was quite small with a double bed. The bathroom was fairly large, but it had a large shower with no bathtub. I felt like it was a giant version of a bathroom from a cruiseship. The double bed was quite uncomfortable, and the pillows were horrible. Neither of us slept well at all either night. The temperature of the room didn't help things either. I noticed in an earlier review that someone had problems with getting heat in the room. We had the opposite problem. We could not cool down the room. I even set the thermostat at 55 degrees, and it was still quite warm. The hallway outside the room was much cooler! I also saw other reviewers complain about hearing doors slamming all of the time. It was an annoyance for us too. We ate breakfast at the attached restaurant and had a very good experience there. Service was great, and the food was quite good. You can't beat the location and price, but you get what you pay for. The room was very clean, but I would be willing to pay more for a decent night's sleep.
