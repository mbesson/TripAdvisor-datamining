My room was well equipped but small. Reception was helpful. Buffet breakfast is fine but costly, at Euro 11.80. Hotel should also provide basics such as coffee and croissant at nominal cost. TV had only Catalan and Spanish speaking channels, not welcoming foreign visitors.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cNot bad overall\u201d", "Author": "yuliyash", "ReviewID": "UR114657066", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here with our 10 month old baby in early June 2011. We stayed for 3 nights and paid 55 euros per night. The first night we stayed in a room on 4th floor, which was not huge but I liked it anyways because it had a nice decor, nice view from the window in the room and a window in the bathroom. The hotel provided us with a crib for our baby and the staff was responsive when I asked for hot water to make formula for the baby. On the third night, we had to move to a room on the first floor facing the walkway to the lobby. It was not the hotel's fault since we decided to stay one more night at the last minute, and the hotel was full except for that one room. I did not like this room because it had a very bad smell of sulfur (I was told the smell was due to recent heavy rains) and we could not open the curtains because everyone entering the hotel could look into our room. After that stay, we travelled elsewhere in Spain and came back to Barcelona in 1 week. We wanted to stay at Colors Hotel again since we generally liked our first stay there and were already familiar with the area. However, the price went up to 85 euros per night all of a sudden. We thought it was too expensive for a three-star hotel at the outskirts of a city. Instead, we stayed at Alimara Hotel for 89 euros. This is a 4 star hotel not far from Colors Hotel. What I liked about the area: it was close to the metro. The neighbourhood is also very nice, not touristy at all. If you go to a cafe, you'll enjoy the authentic Spanish food (tapas) and culture. What I did not like about the area: it sits on steep hills, so it may be hard to walk up and down. Most cafes and restaurants close early (before 9 pm). Bars are open till late, but they are mostly located near Horta metro station, so you'd have to walk quite far down the hill and then back up to the hotel.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riesa, Germany", "Title": "\u201cWe liked it very much\u201d", "Author": "kojak149", "ReviewID": "UR89843540", "Content": "all those friendly people, their professionality, the nice rooms - it seemed like being at home.

We had chosen to stay a bit further out of the centre as the website makes the hotel look so nice. The rooms are very very basic, and our bathroom quite frankly was very bad. It was in need of decoration, cracked tiles, yellowing and dirty grout, the shower curtain was mouldy. The room itself was tiny and although we had booked a double room we were given a room with 2 single beds. Please take a travel hairdryer - I hadn't as the website stated that the rooms had hairdryers - the hairdryer was an antiquated thing that attached to the bathroom wall and that really didn't work that well. Also, the advertised international TV channels seemed to be a myth - we could only find German and French, on a small portable type tv with a really bad picture. If you are traveling from the UK then be careful when you are checking out. We wanted to pay for our bill by Maestro (which we reserved the room with initially). There seemed to be a problem with the hotel's card machine and we had to go to a bank to withdraw the cash to pay the bill - even though we had used Maestro without any problems for the whole holiday. This meant that checking out took about an hour rather than ten minutes. The staff are pleasant but the hotel really isn't as good as it looks. The metro station is only 5 minutes away, and it is on a very good line (line 3), which is good as there is literally nothing around the hotel. It takes 15 minutes on the Metro to get to the centre of Barcelona. If you are checking in later on in the day make sure you have had something to eat! I really hate being so negative about somewhere, but I definitely wouldn't stay there again.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Colors Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d249509-Reviews-Colors_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$67 - $92*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Campoamor 79</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08031</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "249509", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/94/81/9481f112185f2a860ba2fdac93663a5b1large.jpg"}}
