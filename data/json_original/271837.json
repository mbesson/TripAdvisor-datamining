Staff all very friendly and helpful, we were asked to leave our room key in reception whenever we left which was fine, as desk was manned 24hrs. Yet more steps up to the room, luckily we were on the first floor so not too much of a treck. Room very basic, but clean and tidy, bed comfy and a double bed aswell, which are quite hard to come accross in amsterdam normally two singles together so very pleased with that,bathroom small and tidy. Clean towels every day, staff would never try to come in if we were still in the room, always passed towels over the door, which was nice as some cleaners can be a bit invading. Never made it to breakfast, so cant comment on that. Did get a pot of tea one morning which they charged for. Only downside, was that we were facing a building that was having construction work done, so very noisy in mornings. However when we stayed in 2009 there was more work being done in the middle of Rembrantplein, so generally I dont think you can escape it if you want to stay in that area. Overall very good stay, hotel was everything we wanted, clean, tidy, double bed, and smoking room (in 2008, although I shouldnt imagine much has changed). If you want somewhere posh, stay clear, if you just want a good nights sleep in a clean environment for fairly cheap, great hotel.

Breakfast is a bit poor - but if you like ham and cheese butties and boiled eggs you'll love it. (fry up man myself!) The security is spot on - buzzer and intercom entry downstairs and to the rooms. Perfect for young couples and groups, not really for families and older more refined guests. Mashed on night 2 and felt very chilled in room while we came round, so that'll do for me, but aksed for an alarm call and he was 20 mins late, otherwise recommended.", "Date": "October 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cabove the old bell\u201d", "Author": "Nick_King", "ReviewID": "UR4040372", "Content": "This hotel was great! not sure about the reviews below, but me and 5 mates stayed there for 3 nights and found it perfect for exploring amsterdam. friendly staff happy to accomadate to your needs, even gave us a free beer on arrival! the room was clean, showers were hot and a nice location. so you cant really complain! possibly not for families, but is certainly a good hotel for groups of friends!", "Date": "October 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cThe Same Place - Above The Old Bell Pub???\u201d", "Author": "RoadLite", "ReviewID": "UR4011691", "Content": "I've just read the previous reviews with interest - my friends and I stayed at the City Hotel in 2001, it's above the Old Bell Pub on Rembrandtplein.

The place we stayed had a ground-floor entrance on a buzzer with video entry by the reception, rooms were all 1st floor or above. I really can't believe this place would have \"doors kicked in\" - the escape route would be terrible... Hmmm, I do recall my friends, with whom I met up with, were taken by their taxi driver to 2 other places called \"The City Hotel\" before getting to the right one... Are other reviewers confused.
