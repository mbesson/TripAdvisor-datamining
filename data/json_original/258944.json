Reviews looked generally OK but did warn of smallness of rooms. They were right, our room was tiny. When we asked if there was anything bigger they said not really althougn they would move us for our second night to something slightly larger. Actually our room was quite well appointed and comfortable. The decor was a bit dark for a small room. However the lighting was some of the the best I have witnessed in a hotel. Reading was easy, and that is not always possible. The en-suite shower room was again not large but well appointed and modern. There were several examples of loose fittings, loose/ detached handles and failed light bulbs in both the room and the en-suite. I reckon five minutes with a set of screwdrivers and a box of bulbs would have sorted the lot . The LG television was modern but unfortunaltly didn't work remotely because the handset was for a Philips! We got a new handset but only had a very limited selection of channels. There was no BBC1, BBC2, Channel 4 or 5. I set up the television for re-tuning and got the missing channels back. The concierge said he would do this in all the rooms. The situation is good, just a few minutes walk from Paddington one way and Hyde Park the other. The Hotel looks clean and smart from the outside, the staff could not be faulted. If you can stand the small rooms then it is OK. I marked it down for the small rooms and the lack of attention to detailed repairs of fittings and lights. At full prices I would say the hotel is expensive, but then London equals rip-off!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Okehampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot awful, not amazing.\u201d", "Author": "ReddStar", "ReviewID": "UR125325316", "Content": "I stayed for 2 nights recently over the weekend on a solo break to London and would like to have been more impressed, but it did the job.

The bed went wall to wall and you had to vault over it to reach the other side of it (not that there was much point in doing this). The air conditioning was also not working which meant the room was extremely hot during the night and in the morning.

The Hyde Park Premier Paddington was a great choice. The price couldn't be beat and the access to the tube and Paddington train station (Heathrow Express service) was appealing. I would advise prospective visitors to book one of the deluxe rooms, as the regular rooms look from the pictures to be just a bed in a room, with a TV mounted to the wall. Deluxe singles have a twin bed, and the doubles have double beds (not queen-size). We got upgraded to a club room, so if you're looking for a little extra room, you may want to ask for one of those. The club rooms have a little more space to maneuver and are nicely remodeled. It was plenty of room for two people to coexist in for a few days. The hotel has a few appealing amenities. Our club room had both UK and US plugs, although the outlets merely make you able to plug in your appliance. It DOES NOT step down the voltage from 220v to 110v so you will still need a converter if your appliances are not dual-voltage (most laptop chargers are). There is internet, but it is hardwired, not wireless. Nonetheless, it was speedy and reliable. The staff was always courteous and friendly, although our room was not ready by check-in (a price we were willing to pay for the upgrade).

The only real downside is that there is no food in the hotel (no breakfast or dinner for late arrivers, or snack machine in reception that I could see). There used to be a fridge of goodies in the room, but they must have decided to get rid, as the fridge had been removed. Leaving just an empty cupboard with a plug socket in the back. I would have happily paid for the expensive peanuts and chocolates instead of going out on a dark rainy night to hunt for food. The room, crazily, had two phones, which you could almost use at the same time they were so close together. And as there's no food, you wouldn't be calling room service.

I had read on more than one website and that on many occasions the hotel could not allocate the room that had been booked. As I booked the hotel as part of a package for a birthday present with lastminunte.com I was stuck with the booking. On arrival we were informed that our room was no longer available due to a water problem in our room and that we had been booked into another hotel in Kensington. After speaking with reception, really unhappy but not shocked we asked to use the internet to review the other hotel. The receptionist questioned why we wanted to do this! She told us to just go to the hotel and that we would like it. After checking out the hotel we found that it was not in Kensington but outside Earls Court Station. After asking the receptionist why they said it was Kensington and not Earls Court she replied saying yes I know but it\u2019s only 16 minutes away by cab. By this point we were so annoyed we asked for a refund. The same rude receptionist made a call to the manger and was told that as it was booked through lastminute.com we would have to ask them for a refund. The receptionist then asked us to sign to say we had booked in. I informed her that I would not sign for a room I had not seen. She told me I had to sign the form because that\u2019s what you have to do! I refused out right so she ripped the form up in our faces, muttered something to her college and huffed. Absolutely disgusted by the service from the receptionist and the fact that we had to be somewhere by a certain time we had no choice by take a cab to the alternate hotel which actually was a 20 minute drive. I will be writing a formal complaint letter to lastminute.com as this hotel obviously sells itself on the fact that it is a hotel in Hyde Park but then transfers its customers out to other destinations.

When I stay in a 4 star hotel I expect the hotel to live up to that rating. This hotel is one of those London hotels that used to be a large house and has been converted. You can see where they have made an attempt to window dress at 4 star. It has an iron (attached to the ironing bored), internet access (that needs a cable that does not reach to your bed) and a 'desk' that was around 80 cm square, barely large enough to house the kettle and coffee. On arrival I was surprised by the small reception area. I was early so had to leave my bags, they were left in an open area beside reception, not great. When checked in, I handed over my credit card and to my surprise they charged me for both days I was staying up front. I realised after why this happened, you have no option to leave early. When given my key I asked where the lift was and was told 'over there'. I was in a room through a door just in front of reception. The room opened to a small hallway and was visible through a glass door/wall to the breakfast eating area. The room itself had at most 1m either side of the bed. The desk size as mentioned above is extremely small and impossible to even consider using to put a laptop on and work. Bathroom was equally small and I felt unsafe as the window (which was open) pretty much opened out to the ground outside. I had a very uncomfortable night and decided to pay the money for the Novatel Paddington. When I checked out I was told that my payment was non refundable. Of course it is, that is why you pay up front, they must get a lot of this. Go to the Novatel, it is a real 4 star hotel. Exactly what it says it is and perfect for business. Much closer to Paddington Station as well.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lincolnshire", "Title": "\u201cDon't expect too much, and DO NOT park outside the hotel!!!\u201d", "Author": "greenjanine", "ReviewID": "UR62590662", "Content": "Booked as a 'secret hotel' through lastminute.com....would not have booked this hotel had I read the reviews before hand. Excellent location, 5 minutes from tube station, however the rooms upstairs are minute, and our room was below ground with no lift access, down a steep flight of stairs. Not ideal. The underground rooms are dark, obviously no view and minimal daylight, windows don't open. Kept awake by cooing pigeons and the sound of underground trains.... Otherwise, the plus points are that the underground room was quite spacious and clean, decor was good. Main complaint was despite planning to park our car in the local NCP, we were advised by the hotel manager to park in the loading bay at the front of the hotel from midday Saturday until we were due to depart, as it was a Bank Holiday weekend. We were repeatedly assured we would not need to use the NCP as it was Bank Holiday. Taking this advice, we left our car and when we came back a few hours later we had a parking ticket, with a \u00a360 fine. To cut a long story short, we have paid the fine, complained to the management of the hotel and they refuse to reimburse the money.

They just keep lying. It took about 30 minutes to check in, they said the hotel network does not work, room is not ready, and need time to check the booking but I do not know how it can be.. The room was, as other people say, very small but this was acceptable as we are not so big. But if you are relatively big, you will find uncomfortable with the room. In descriptions of the hotel on their website, booking.com or other webpages, you would think they equip with pretty good amenities and facilities, especially they are a 4-star hotel. However, this is the worst 4-star hotel I have ever stayed. The room had a TV but only 2 channels were available. The internet did not work. The shower did not give us enough water. The sink worked very slowly. They did not change bed sheets throughout our stay without any notice. They did not take garbage in a dust bin. There were a lot of garbages in a desk and wardrobe (not ours!! probably previous guests'!!). They said a bottle of water is free but only one small bottle in 4 nights. Shampoo and soap were filled only once. We asked receptionists to check and fix those problem and they said they would check by evening but nothing happened. They just show themselves that they are a 4-star hotel and delightful to serve for us but they are liars. 3-star is even too much for them. If they care customers enough, this hotel should be closed!!", "Date": "April 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Frankfurt, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "khunter76", "ReviewID": "UR60540926", "Content": "This hotel was offering the best prices in the London area.
