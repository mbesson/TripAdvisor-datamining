He said the power was off from 9pm to 12 noon, as if it was a planned shutdown. The attitude and lack of dedication to serving hot drinks to those who appeared for breakfast meant that we went without one - he had 5 minutes to offer and serve us one if he knew it was going off.

I was pleasantly surprised to have stayed at this hidden gem. It is a small hotel about a seven to ten minute walk from Santa Lucia station. I suggest making your first stop at the tourist center. You can buy a tourist pack containing a map and guide book for 2.50 euros (a great deal). Upon meeting the hotel staff, they were very kind with a smile and a \"Buon Giorno.\" The room was quaintly decorated in a Venetian design. It was small but a typical size for most European hotels (not a big deal to me). My daughter and I stayed for five days so there was ample closet and storage space for our lugagge and things. One thing I did appreciate was the cleanliness of the hotel and room. Our room was immaculate. The bathroom was modernized and an adequate size to accomodate the personal items of two women. Our stay included breakfast that was simple: a variety of croissants, rolls, biscuits; preserves; yogurts and; your choice of juice and coffees. Venice is a city for walking. The Hotel Falier is centrally located to most sites and within walking distance. For a change, you can also take the water taxi. We stayed on for several trips around the canal. Don't forget your camera because the view is picture perfect. Just beautiful! As for food, there area several restaurants and bars nearby just take your pick. I wanted to experience some of the local cuisine and had the cuttle fish with polenta. My daughter had the gorgonzola with walnuts and penne. Both were YUMMY!!! You can also save a few euros by shopping at the supermarket for basics (water, sodas, juice and munchies). You can also venture down one of the alleys to a bar, deli, bakery or the Rialto Market for fresh fruits and veggies. Some of our best meals were a bottle of wine, bread, variety of cheeses, salad and antipasti. The Hotel Falier only enhanced our stay Venice.

I was attracted to it after reading the Guide Routard and Tripadvisor. On the website it looked pretty but of course most hotels look pretty on the websites. I made up my mind to book when I saw they had an internet offer: pay online (non refundable) and you get 20% discount. So in November (low season for most hotels in Venice), a twin ensuite room with breakfast cost me only 72euros per night. It's a small cozy hotel in the heart of Venice. I know the city well, but always inevitably get lost trying to find my way around. This hotel, on the contrary, was very easy to get to from the train station (5-6 minutes), so I strongly advise it for anybody who's never been to the city and/or has heavy luggage. The directions from station to hotel and viceversa are easily memorized - not a common thing in Venice. The hotel is small and elegantly furnished. The staff are very professional and polite. Big breakfast with a variety of hot and cold food/drink that can keep you going for hours. Part of it is buffet, but for coffee and extras you ask a waitress. The interior is spotless, carpeted and very quiet. So was my room, n. 26, at the end of the first floor corridor. I haven't seen any other room, but I have no reason to believe they are any way different from mine. I'm not sure how many floors there are (I think 2), nor if there is a lift, so if you find it hard to walk or have heavy luggage, ask before booking. My room was perfect. Spotless (I'm the sort of person who looks under beds and behind furniture), with quality beds, bed linen, windows and furnishings. The style is Venetian, with pastel coloured wood and delicate flower designs. The bathroom was also spotless, with clean towels every day, hairdryer, extractor fan, mosquito net at the window (some hotel bathrooms don't even have a window!), and accessories. Strong hot shower. The room featured TV, phone, a small safe, air conditioning, and extra snow white pillows. Everything was working perfectly. During my stay, the weather changed abruptly, with temperatures outside well below zero and freezing winds, but the room was nice and warm. Admittedly, my room was not very large (the Hilton certainly has bigger ones), but the size of hotel rooms is last in order of importance for me. This twin room has more than enough space for two people to move round, store and open cases, shoes, clothes and personal belongings, sit at the desk, look out of the window, etc. The bathroom was very spacious and also warm. A piece of advice: the hotel offers a free water-taxi ride to Murano. Take advantage of it, even if you've already pre-paid public transport! If, like me, you're not rolling in money and unable to spend 60 or more euro for the thrill of a taxi in Venice, you'll feel like royalty, sitting on leather sofas and enjoying the canals (including a part of the Canal Grande) from a totally different perspective, arriving at destination in no time. The reason why Falier and other hotels offer this trip is to encourage visitors to buy original Murano glass and not be lured into buying the cheap Chinese imports sold in the vast majority of shops all over Venice as \"real Murano glass\". This water-taxi will bring you to Murano, where you will go into a glass-making factory, see a short demonstration of the glass blowing process (very interesting), and then go on into a showroom where you can browse round, have assistance if you wish, and feel under no pressure whatsoever to buy. I, for example, didn't. If you think it's impossible that an inexpensive 2star hotel doesn't have anything \"wrong with it\", I can tell you that the only thing \"wrong\" with my room was the lid of the little bin in the bathroom, which wouldn't stay on its hinges. Not a major inconvenience! I have found my hotel in Venice and will come back here again and again.

It has it's own private terrace, and the room felt a little bigger...the shower is smaller and water collects right on the floor next to the toilet, but no big deal...the terrace was awesome!!! We sat out there most nights before dinner and enjoyed the great views and bells from the nearby church towers. (They even throw in free wireless internet service). Breakfast was adequate with bread, coffee, juice, cereal (no hot food). There are plenty of nearby restaurants worth trying as well - we recommend \"Al Ponte\", about a 10 minute walk from the hotel, right on a small canal - great food and ambiance.
