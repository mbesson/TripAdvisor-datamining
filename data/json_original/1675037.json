I was thoroughly disappointed by the fact that the only reason I booked the hotel was that they stated they had tempur beds in all their rooms and what I found was the cheapest mattress I've ever seen and a terrible back pain the next morning.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel - good quality\u201d", "Author": "JasmineD2", "ReviewID": "UR118773508", "Content": "We're just back from a few days at the Grenzfall. It was our first time to stay here - and we were very impressed: large, clean, comfortable rooms; friendly, competent staff; and a wonderful garden at the back. [We'd recommend you ask for a garden-view room.] Very good location too: a few stops on the U-bahn into town; a short walk along Ackerstr. towards Hackescher Markt; and a few stops on the 10 tram to Prenzlauer Berg. Also try renting bikes from the hotel [only \u20ac10 for the day]. Breakfast is extra, which was the only downside: it might be worth skipping this and having breakfast elsewhere. Otherwise, however, full marks to the Grenzfall: we would happily stay here again.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel-would go back in a heartbeat\u201d", "Author": "Twintraveler3", "ReviewID": "UR116355888", "Content": "The tourist info at the Berlin train station booked us here. Lovely large rooms with a clean modern design. Staff was very friendly and helpful and spoke English.

Rooms are well furnished, with a simple elegance. Beds are comfortable. The rooms overlook either a large garden or a small street without through traffic, and are very quiet. Reception staff is friendly, competent and multi-lingual. The hotel restaurant, which fronts on the garden -- some tables are available outside -- has a good selection of well-prepared meals at modest prices; service was friendly and quick. The breakfast buffet was ample and tasty, if a bit pricey at 11 \u20ac. A kiosk with coffee and snacks is just outside the hotel.
