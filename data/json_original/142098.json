{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Never Again! I belong to the Choice Rewards program, so always try to book one of their hotels. This place, however, is a DUMP!I stayed for two nights. They have one small elevator in the entire hotel which was filthy--walls and carpet and trash. It was so dirty looking that I took to using a tissue to push the buttons!My room was clean (looking) but old with cigarette burns on the TV set, a missing lamp bulb...just a typical frumpy looking older hotel room. HOWEVER, in the morning, after kicking off the covers due to the room being hot, I saw two 10-inch circular blood stains on the bedspread, plus one large urine stain surrounding that! This was not old bloodstains, either, that turn brown after washing....these were red and never been washed. I totally grossed out and left it on the floor with a note for the maid of a sad smiley face.When I got back from my business meetings, they had put a new bedspread on the bed, but it was still in my mind...along with the overall uncleanliness of the entire hotel and it being a trucker haven (in their hotel info booklet, they had lots of papers of gentlemen's clubs and massage services available nearby).I will say one positive about the place--it did offer free Wi-Fi and it was easy to connnect to and had a strong signal during my entire stay.I will never stay there again.", "Date": "May 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR918409287", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "teechur"}, {"Content": "Avoid at all costs Stayed at this motel for two nights and have to consider it the worst accomodation I've been in north of the Mexican border. Towels like sandpaper, walls so paper-thin you can hear tv's two doors down! Worst of all, the second night a guy at the parking lot next door was using a leaf blower ALL NIGHT LONG until 4 in the morning! Upon complaining to the boy at the front desk the next morning I received: no refund, no reduction, and no apology. Nothing. This is the kind of place that gives motels a bad name. Will never stay in this chain again.
