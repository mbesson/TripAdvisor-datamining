This is incorrect as the hotel is located on the corner of the following street. I had forgotten to request a high-up room and was given one on the ground floor. I did not experience any problems with noise and would not have known I was on the ground floor or that I was only a few doors away from the Reception desk! My hotel room was split into two areas. The first area (when you walk in) had a sofa, desk and table. There was a kitchenette area along one wall. I did not use this so cannot comment. The second area past the kitchenette contained a huge bed and a door off to the bathroom. The bathroom had a big double shower and was a nice size. The windows had shutters rather than curtains which were great at blocking out light. The room was practical and clean.

We were given various information about the availability of the rooms and eventually had to book two nights that were not convenient for our schedule at all. Since we already payed for this and could not get a refund, we had to agree. Upon arrival to the hotel, the receptionist seemed quite distracted, without any hospitality manners. He did not even say \"welcome\". We were given a twin room with separate beds, even though we have booked a double bed. We were told there are no double beds, however it seemed many rooms were not occupied in the hotel. I needed to use internet to send an important document and the hotel's connection was down. Even though wifi was included in the booking fee, the receptionist offered us to use another connection in the hotel for a certain fee (or go to a nearby internet cafe). Customer service slacking from a second receptionist already. Eventually, after the receptionists switched shifts, the new one had no information about internet connection being down and gave ma the password. The room was small, clean at first sight, but not so much when you take a closer look. The room design is quite weird, because the toilet is right in the middle of the room,quite near to the bed; meaning the toilet seat is about 3 meters from your pillow, separated by thin glass. We do not recommend this hotel as it is not worth the money we paid (even with discount) and there are plenty of other hotels in Bcn with better quality and service. With the service this hotel is providing, it seems very unlikely for them to survive in an environment with better standard competition.

The rooms are large and well equipped. The only problem I had with my room was that it was non-smoking, but when I checked in it was quite obvious that the guest before me was not a non-smoker. There was not much I could do but open the windows to try and air it out. I talked to the front desk and they offered to come spray a deodorizer but I was worried that the smell of the deordorizer plus the smell of smoke would be too much. Others in our group complained of smoke coming into their non smoking rooms from surrounding rooms when they had their windows open. The biggest problem with the hotel was the food. Our group had breakfast and dinner two nights. The first night I explained to the staff, in Spanish, that I'm vegetarian (which would have also been communicated ahead of time by our group tour guide), and they had a non meat alternative for me, which was fine. The second night there weren't any dishes without meat. When I asked the server about the vegetarian meal, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away.

However full marks to the front desk for 'finding' a space and this was a great help - on street parking is available, pay until 18.00, free overnight, (but no apparent spaces anywhere near the facility, so suggest pre-book the hotels spaces - \u20ac15 per day fee). Apartment offered was on ground floor, road side - the alternative is courtyard side. As the building fits the site on a steep slope behind the hill of Montjuic, this meant as others note that the rooms are very dim as the road side part of the building and has screens against the traffic. There is a seating area outside the room with table and chairs provided - but this is behind the screens, so the space has no 'daylight' and is dingy and not attractive - never even considered sitting there. The criticsm of the accommodation sounds worse than the quality and value for money - one broken window pane, nothing offered in the kitchen area apart from two glasses - but fridge, microwave oven and sink installed - shower head was broken so the spray was always against the wall, sink coming off the wall, one bedside light not working, aggressively bright ceiling lights, but a depressing colourway of grey walls and mushroom coloured furniture meant the appearance is not inviting. Broken seat back on one chair. Towels that won't dry you off and only 3 coat hangers in the wardrobes....come on guys, spend \u20ac5 a room and get some more please! Most irritating aspect was an emergency light in the room over the door that stays on 24 hrs - so the room is lit all night long, albeit that light is dim! Note the courtyard facing rooms are open to the public space leading to the breakfast room, so though they have full daylight, these are not particularly in a 'private space'. The better side of things - the beds are comfortable, sheets very crisp and clean. Breakfast (though it closes at 9.00 a.m.) is a buffet of cereal, pastries, yoghurts, coffee, fruit juice and toast / preserves. Roof top pool and sun deck is definitely available to all guests - not only the residents of the on-site apartments staying long term but hotel guests too (A tip - on check out, we requested the use of the pool later in the day before leaving for the airport, and for a small key deposit this was free to use. Handy option if you have a late flight or want to have some sun and space in town before travelling on). Small mini market a short walk away has the essentials, and all of Barcelona is easy to reach using the public transport. NB - buy a multi-pass ticket for the buses and Metro which saves a lot of hassle with small change. I'd recommend the hotel of you can book in plenty of time and get the best price - \u20ac39 a night paid (...which was fine taking the negative points and I hope there is a replace and repair programme to get the place back to a good condition - it isn't that old a building, and as part of a chain, if the owners want business in their other locations, they will lose out if the BCN Montjuc is the first example of their business...) but rate went to \u20ac90 closer the date of arrival - not worth that higher price though I'm afraid. Good as a place to fall asleep after a days' sightseeing, and staff are pleasant and attentive, so I can recommend it, but it does need a sprucing up. As for Barcelona - excellent destination for food, sightseeing and a place to wander around!", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BCN Montjuic Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d639129-Reviews-BCN_Montjuic_Hotel-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$73 - $197*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">San Fructuoso 64-74</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08004</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "639129", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/de/87/35/habitacion-doble-o-doble.jpg"}}
