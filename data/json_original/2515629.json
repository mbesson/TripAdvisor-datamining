We were on the 9th floor (pet free) and had good views of Petco Park, although the Padres weren't doing very well when we were there!! The pool area (on the fourth floor) was inviting and we spent a lovely afternoon just soaking up the sun around the small heated pool. We didn't breakfast in the hotel, although you could. We walked one block to \"The Broken Yolk\" cafe every morning. You must give this place a try, its a great place to start your day. Lovely staff, great food, and a never ending supply of coffee ( a novelty for us Brits!)

I go on there sometimes and enter a really low price for a 4 or 5 star hotel in a place I'd like to go, this was the first time it actually worked. I originally booked 2 nights but my wife thought that was too short and added another night at the same price. I had never heard of Hotel Solamar or kimpton before (I'm usually a Marriott person), but I really enjoyed our stay. This hotel is in a great location and is within easy walking distance to many restaurants, stores, and attractions. The beds are comfortable (a bit noisy when you'd get in/out or roll over) and the rooms are very well appointed. The view from our 10th floor room was pretty great. We could see the bay and it overlooked the pool on the 4th floor. My 2 year old son enjoyed looking out the window in the morning and watching all of the delivery trucks making their morning runs. I took the advice of one of the reviewers on here and signed up for their InTouch rewards program before I left. It didn't get me an upgrade (they said they were booked), but I did get free wi-fi and got to \"raid the minibar\". The heated pool was great as was lounging in one of the cabanas. We stayed during the week so we didn't have the weekend crowds. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The only downside was the parking. $40+tips per night to valet. Other hotels in the area were about the same price. Neighboring lots were about $25 for overnight parking, or if you could find a place on the street, it was free between 6pm and 8am and 1.25/hour during the day.

Our group checked in late to a welcoming, receptive staff but when I got to my room it had a distinct odor of rotten eggs! I called down, and within five minutes a staff member came up with keys for a new room who took one whiff, confirmed my dislike about the odor, and apologized for the inconvenience. I was transferred from the 9th floor to a similar area on the 5th floor directly overlooking the pool area where a lively bar/pool party seemed to be in full swing. The noise was not troublesome to me at all, and I got a great night's sleep. I was up early for a trip to Coronado and the following morning to head back to the airport. I love the hotel's green initiative, funky interior design, the original local artwork on the walls, the room amenities, and the coffee, tea, and iced lemon water available in the lobby. I saw the hotel is animal friendly and I was happy to see this, but more happy that I didn't hear or experience any animal noise or disruptions during my stay. I had brief but warm experiences with all the staff at the hotel, and I'm sad I wasn't there to take advantage of their wine hour, something I would have enjoyed greatly! The hotel is located in the middle of all the action- close to theatre, sporting arenas, and surrounded by restaurants and clubs. It can get loud in the evenings and weekend, but that was never a distraction. We had a great dinner at Donovan's Steak House, a three minute walk from the hotel.

First things first, the location of this hotel is spectacular, its a block away from Petco Park and near every restaurant you want eat at in Gaslamp and across the street from a cupcake bakery. Starbucks is about 5 blocks away though, but good news is they serve coffee in the lobby in the morning (bad news, no in-room coffee maker!) and down the street is a greasy spoon called the Broken Yolk. The valet boys are very nice and super accomodating, however the valet area is very very small, so be prepared to wait if you are there on a busy weekend like we were. Check in is very casual, and note that if you book through a third party site like I did and try to add a second name to the registration in case they are arriving seperately, when the record is transferred over, the second name will become the first and they will only be able to see that name. Its a glitch that could become a serious problem for some. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite (which is decorated in a beachy modern pottery barn style- even my husband liked it), which was great since it had a door, but bathroom only accessible through the bedroom. Everything was nice in the bedroom, the pull out sofa, as usual, was not made up and we had to call for blankets. The mini bar is extra nice and they leave room in the mini fridge for your drinks and leftovers. Theres a hall closet with safe and two leopard print robes. Also they had put a dog bed in our room because we said we were bringing the dog. The bathroom had the BIGGEST, DEEPEST jacuzzi tub I've ever seen, it was truly amazing!! LOVE it!, The glassed in shower also nice. However the room was not made up the first day, even though we were out of the room from 9am-4pm and then again when we went to the pool, it meant we had no clean towels :( Huge oversight, yuck! We called for towels and they brought us two, but who wants to go on vacation and have to do their own cleaning.. so we were stuck all night in a messy hotel room. Boo boo boo. The pool area is interesting, as its really meant to accomodate the nightly bar scene of young singles who come to socialize, its very pretty with alot of sitting tables and beautiful views. The pool itself is very small and no hot tub, very limited lounge chairs, but we didn't have a problem getting one. If you're single and looking to mingle, the pool area after 8 looked great :)! As this hotel is VERY dog friendly, there is a nightly free wine hour between 5-6pm, which we partook of every night, most people sit in the gorgeous lobby with their laptop and/or friends and their dogs and drink. Its very nice, but it was slightly awkward with chlidren, we felt a little old for the hotel at that time, even thought we're not. Many of the visitors were late 20s or early 30s. They will put the wine in plastic cups if you ask so you can take up to your room or by the pool more easily. We drove to Balboa park one day and it was easy and fast, and we walked to Petco park 2 nights, don't forget theres a grassy area at Petco where you can go watch the game for $5 on the jumbotron and also the \"beachers\" which is a sand area for kids and benches for the parents. And there's sort of secret restaurant on the 5th floor I think that has two seatings 1-3 innings and 4-7 innings... the terrace there is very nice. We also took the Petco Park tour and I enjoyed it very much, you get to tour the exclusive Sony lounges and home plate club areas, plus see all the inner workings of the stadium. Its a must for any true baseball lover, just make sure to bring your regular tickets with you as well.

I had read other reviews of the Solamar and while most were good, I was a bit concerned about the area. Boy was I surprised! What a fabulous location close to everything! The hotel is in great shape with very modern decorating and amenities. The rooms were all updated, clean & comfortable. We were on the 9th floor which I would recommend as it was a non-pet floor. The rooftop pool and bar were absolutely beautiful and I wish I'd had more time to spend there. We went to the hotel restaurant Jsix for breakfast and while they had a very limited menu and it was a bit expensive, the food was excellent. The hotel has a wine hour in their lobby from 5-6 with complimentary wine. We did this both nights we were there. What a nice way to start our evening! We met so many nice people from all over the world. The area was a bit touristy and the restaurants a bit spendy, but it's not anything we didn't expect. The \"barkers\" at the front doors of every restaurant were a bit obnoxious, but the food was delicious and the bars were fun. The hotel valet parking was expensive, but there are much cheaper options conveniently located within a block of the hotel &I didn't mind not parking on site.

They switched us to an 8th floor room, which had the weird smell of whatever \"natural products\" they use to clean up after the pets, and also happened to be overlooking the pool, where a party was being held. We were told there were no other options. In our first room, my contact case fell under the sink, and I discovered that area quite unclean when I reach under to retrieve it.

Our taste buds fell in love with the exquisite house-made ravoili. To our delight, the chef introduced himself to us (we love that) at our table, and our personable and perfectly attentive waitress, Jaimie, made the experience warm and friendly, which is often lost at exquisite resturants. Our man of the night, Angel, provided us with exceptional customer service, and made sure each of our accommodations were in perfect order. The rooms are very tastefully done, and the little mini bar in our 7th floor corner room was very reasonably priced. Fifteen dollars for a medium-sized bottle of Ketel. I love that this Kimpton line of hotels favors a green way of business. They buy exclusively local, and they have a rooftop garden, which the chef pointed out, provides many greens for the kitchen.

We've been to good and bad, but the Solamar is right up there with the best we've been to. It was the first time we'd been to San Diego so we booked this place on the back of reviews and it's central location, initially for a couple of days until we got our bearings. It was that good we ended booking a further two, then another day to make five in total - the only reason we didn't stay on Saturday was that it was fully booked! The rooms are a great size - we had a room with two super comfy queen beds - and the bathroom is nice too. The design of the rooms and hotel is very 'boutique' and it was right in the Gaslamp Quarter near bars and restaurants, virtually all of which are kid friendly. Despite the location, we never had any problem with noise at all. The local public transport system is excellent, a $5 pass got us on and off trolleys and buses all day to places like Sea World, SD Zoo and the outlet shopping centre on the border (well worth visiting for shopping bargains). What sets this hotel apart from other good places though is the staff - from the moment we walked in until the moment we left they made us feel like we were the only people staying. Our seven year old was asked every morning where we were off to that day, and how she'd got on when we got back every evening. No question was too much hassle, and they went out of their way to look after us, especially the girls on the front desk who re-booked us in each time for our extra nights. In an industry where too often customers are just numbers, it's a real welcome change to go somewhere where customer service is clearly something they believe in 100%. The wine at night and coffee in the mornings were nice touches too. In short, this may not be the cheapest hotel in town but we got a good deal off a late booking website for the first few days and then through the hotel themselves after that.

It created a very sour taste in my mouth that our stay had a $200 surcharge. Second, the location is so near clubs and bars that there is an ever present noise in the rooms. Cars, sirens, loud people....this is near the top floor. The noise goes until at least one in the morning. The last piece that was disappointing is the quality of beds. For the price, the mattresses are junk. You can feel each individual spring. I have never tossed and turned so much for lack of comfort.

The staff is what really makes this property a place I'll return to. Angel and Seth, at the front desk, were particularly helpful. Angel told me about a cool speakeasy-style bar not far away, and Seth gave me extra-late checkout when I really needed it. Usually when you ask for late check out, a hotel's front desk clerk MAY begrudgingly give you until 1 p.m., but Seth gave me until 3:30. My only complaint, and it's a small one, was that on a Thursday afternoon in early February, there was no food service at the pool. (It was a beautiful, warm, sunny afternoon.) Nor was there even a menu available to check, and you couldn't get room service at the pool. I had to go to my room, read the menu (the hotel web site doesn't even offer a menu), call the hotel restaurant, have them call my cell phone when my food was ready, then go down and pick it up.

There is a self-park lo directly across the street for $25 but the lot closes at midnight and I don't think there are in/out privileges. The only hiccup to the stay was my room keys were deactivated in the middle of my stay. The one thing I really didn't like are the horrible soap dispensers. There is no bar soap provided, only poorly working pump dispensers in the shower (impossible to identify the soap form the shampoo from the conditioner if you wear glasses). The sink only had a pump bottle of soap and no other amenities - just a price list of items they sell. I ended up walking down to the nearby CVS drugstore and bought soap. Another thing, if you are travelling with kids, you might not like one aspect of the room set-up where they have a bar (not free) that has several mid-size bottles of liquor and wine sitting out in the open along with snacks.

I think I had a uniquely poor experience which I would perhaps blame on Murphy's Law and the Thanksgiving holiday. My boyfriend and I had Thanksgiving to ourselves - no kids, no family this year, so we decided to take a little adult vacation for turkey day. We arrived on Tuesday the 22nd of November, two days before the holiday. The hotel was located on the border of the up and coming East Side Village, the Gas Lamp, the ball park and the convention center. They do not have a parking garage unless you valet, but there are two or three parking lots, with varying daily rates, right near by. This was the first thing that struck me as unfortunate but not something that was worth much more thought. The hotel itself was nice, modern and clean. They also take pets here - which was really cool to see a nicely kept property to offer. They also keep the top two floors of the property absolutely free of pets, so if you are not a fan of pet hair and dander, you have your own sanctuary. That being said, I never heard a single pup nor did I witness or experience any poor interaction with any bad pet owners or pets. Our check in person was very sweet and explained to us that the hotel was taking advantage of the quiet time during the holiday to do some repairs and renovations. She offered us a bottle of wine to say thank you in advance for any inconvenience, she also offered us two complimentary continental breakfasts from the in house restaurant J-six. Unfortunately for the hotel, we are well versed in wine and I can promise you that we would not regift or even use this bottle of wine for sangria - it was shwag, but we appreciated the gesture. Overall, our stay at the hotel was great. It was a clean and quiet place to rest our head at the end of our nights. Our main issue really came down to a problem with the complimentary continental breakfast and the restaurant J-six. We came into the restaurant on the third day, on the 24th for our complimentary breakfast. We stood in a very empty restaurant that appeared to be without a hostess. We wanted to get our breakfast to-go so we could enjoy it back up in our room. We figured this would be easy to take care of. We waited for about 10 minutes at an empty bar until a hostess appeared. She apologized for the delayed attention and explained she was new and that the one server on hand was having a bad day. The hostess offered to take our order but was immediately confused and completely unknowledgeable about the comp. continental - or what a continental breakfast was comprised of. This was the first time in my relationship where I gave my boyfriend the green light to raise hell about this restaurants total incompetence; this was after I watched the hostess and the manager grab our food from the open kitchen with their bare hands and dumping our food into to-go containers. What freaked me out more was that the chef in the kitchen did not even try to stop them from putting their unwashed hands into his food. We did not eat the breakfast, nor did we ever step foot back into J-six. We also spoke to the front desk and said we were disappointed about the miscommunication about this complimentary breakfast program. The hotel tried their best to right the wrong with us by sending us another horrible bottle of wine and covering our valet parking for the entirety of our stay. The restaurant manager, the one who touched our food, gave my boyfriend a contrived apology by phone. So, we were miffed, hungry, and disappointed, but as for the hotel itself, I would not steer anyone away from the great value and location, but I would recommend dining at any of the many restaurants within walking distance over J-six.

Top notch, very friendly, quick and helpful. Roof top lounge-was perfect with a pool, modern style decor consisting of fire pits, heat lamps, multiple cabanas, out door fire place, tables, couches, a great view of the gas lamp district below, out door shower (out of public view) to rinse after pool use, with a nice bar as well. Hotel lobby/lounge-VERY NICE, Beautifully done with with fire place, couches, chairs. A nice touch is the free wine hour from 5-6pm!! Be there about 5-minutes early to get a great place to sit, relax an enjoy your wine :). We had the Chilean Cab!!! Very good!! This place was pet friendly as well!! Perfect if you plan to bring your dog!! The Room was styled nice and cozy with comfortable beds and nice cushy sized chair!!. We had a room on the 6th floor over looking the pool and really enjoyed the view. Best of all was the location of this hotel to fine dining and all of what the Gas Lamp has to offer. You do not need your car if you only plan to visit nearby Seaport Village, Convention Center or the Gas Lamp district. The 2 Cons: First was the parking/vallet prices at $40/night. You do get in/out privileges at no extra charge though if you plan on using your car. We didn't use our car and parked right across the street for $25/night which was very convenient!! The other con was the walls and doors were so thin (maybe just our room) you could hear EVERYTHING including crying-barking dogs, people talking etc.out in the Hallway as well as the room next to ours. Security was very quick wonderful at quieting guest that were loud and disturbing others. So needless to say I had horrible sleep the first night and my Wife did the second night.

We were able to tie them to the railing in the outdoor patio of the restaurant so the dogs could be with us. Had great food at La Fiesta (Mexican Cruisine and Lounge) and also at the Italian restaurant connected with it. One restaurant down. The hotel is really comfortable and give nice comfortable beds for the dogs which also match the decor of the room. Also furnished doggie food/water dishes and lots of tasty treats - a whole assortment of them. Loved the welcome VIP pet signs. Enjoyed seeing all the names of the pets staying there. Also, found the staff to be really friendly, customer focused and all seemed to love the pets too. You can tell the staff love working there. This is the third Kimpton hotel we have stayed at and we loved it. Love the out of the box ideas the hotel has like providing a goldfish for those who miss there pets, late checkout on Sundays, no parking fees for hybrid cars, etc. Kimpton hotels stand out from the rest. Oh! and they don't charge pet fees. Incredible. Another nice touch which was a surprise was that on Christmas day, since the restaurant was closed, they provided all the guests a complimentary continental breakfast. Really enjoyed it and got to meet some of the other guests while eating near the fireplace. Felt at home there and am looking forward to returning. Only wish there were more Kimpton hotels all over the place. Would always stay there if there was.

Let me start off by saying that there are a lot of positive things about the hotel. Great location in the heart of the Gaslamp district, if that is where you want to stay. Walking distance to shops, restaurants, ballpark, etc. Also, the staff is incredibly friendly in general. And there are lots of extras, like the happy hour in the lobby every evening, and coffee/tea in the morning. Rooms are pretty nice, not extremely luxurious, but there are some touches that put it above an average room, and well-maintained and clean. I wish that my review could end there. However, there were a lot of issues that occurred during our stay there that caused great frustration. The first thing that guests should be aware of is that the rooms are not that well-insulated from the noise from weekend partying. We had a supposedly \"quiet\" room, and even though our room was away from the main street, it was very loud in our room from the music blasting from the rooftop bar nearby. It kept us until 1 or 2 am! Also, we had some problems with the cable not working in one room, and the pocket doors from the suite not working in another room. It forced us to switch rooms which was inconvenient. But really the final straw is that one day we left our room at noon, REMOVED the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign from our door, and then came back to our room at 5pm. We called the front desk and said that nothing could be done for us except they could bring fresh towels. They said that it was hotel policy that once the housekeeping passes your room, we would have to make a request to have our room cleaned. We had no idea that housekeeping already passed our room! We were really upset about this. Later another staff person said that they cleaned our rooms early in the morning and then made another pass around our room (before 12 noon) but still saw the DND sign so left us alone. I have stayed at a LOT of hotels, many more than I have time to post about on TripAdvisor, and this has never happened to me - how was I supposed to know what time they went by our room and therefore was supposed to request housekeeping? I think leaving the room at noon is completely reasonable sometimes when you're on vacation - ESPECIALLY when you've been kept up until 1am with noise from the outside. I don't know why it wouldn't be hotel policy to just make sure all the rooms are cleaned until specifically requested otherwise? Very upsetting. The only reason this hotel didn't get two stars is that they handled the situation well afterwards. The front desk manager was very nice and made some appropriate accommodations. Just a final note: I think the parking rate is expensive, but completely within reason for the area.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, HI", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, cute boutique hotel..\u201d", "Author": "JSanico", "ReviewID": "UR121645770", "Content": "Stayed here twice whenever I have to stay overnight in San Diego...

The rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable, but the rooms are just average sized and they don't have suites, so if you like a bigger room to lounge-around in you might think that the rooms are not big enough. The staff is very friendly and professional, and of course the location is what makes this hotel so appealing. The prices at the Solamar can be quite high sometimes, so if you are just looking for a decent place in the Gaslamp district I would recommend checking out the many Hilton and Marriott hotels also located throughout the Gaslamp, because they often have much better prices. Hotel prices in San Diego fluctuate *dramatically* depending on the time of year, tourist season, and when the city is less full vs. the times it gets booked-up due to a large convention or major sporting event, so if the timing of your trip is flexible and the prices seem surprisingly high you might want to check the hotel prices for different possible times that work for you. The Solamar has a wine hour every evening, which is a nice thing to offer, and the wine was fine, but there wasn't quite enough room for all of the people so it was a little on the crowded side, and they shut that wine bar down the very second the scheduled hour is over. They also have a rooftop bar at night, out where the pool is, and we were looking forward to enjoying a drink there at the end of our day, but it was definitely not our scene - it was crowded with people in their 20's, dressed to get attention, dramatic and flirty, and the music they had was loud pumping club music. It was interesting people watching, but it was not our thing so we left after one quick drink. If you like a trendy place, in a great location, and might enjoy the club scene at their rooftop bar this would be a great place for you. If you are just looking for a nice clean place right in the middle of the Gaslamp district this can be a great choice, except for the fact that at times the prices at the Solamar are much higher than the other perfectly nice standard hotels nearby. If you are looking for a hotel with suite or a really big room, and you plan to spend a significant part of your day in your room I would not recommend the Solamar.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAlways a great time\u201d", "Author": "HankHenry", "ReviewID": "UR121503725", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for a staycation while we went out to the gaslamp with friends, since its just walking distance from restruants and bars.

This may have been the best hotel stay in my entire life, and certainly on this trip. The hotel obviously is aiming to go out of it's way to please it's guests and aim for return customers. I often joked with my wife that I felt like I could walk up to the front desk and ask for anything and my wish would be granted. First of all, the room: Perfect. We asked for a \"quiet\" room, an absolute must in this hotel. There are rooms facing the pool which will keep you up nights. y asking for a \"quiet room\" you will not have this problem. Our room faced the Gaslamp area, there was a nightclub across the street, but the room had some type of sound insulation so I didn't really hear any music from the outdoor nightclub. The bed was great, comfy chairs, and a minibar fridge I kept food in without any trouble. The pool area is fantastic. Every day I sat at the pool in a free cabana, read the paper, a book, or used the free internet service. At times I was alone at the pool, enjoying a drink or just cold water. There is a pool waitress but she doesn't bug you. At 5 pm everyday they have free wine. I usually got a glass, brought it to my room, and saved it for my wife, who was at a convention till 6 or 7 pm. One night she arrived at the wine tasting at 6:05 pm, they had closed, so the desk gave her coupons for 2 free glasses at the restaurant. THe service aspect is extraordinaire! I went to a number of amazing restaurants in San DIego (including the hotel's). A few times I brought back leftovers. The next day, I went to the front desk, I asked them to \"warm up\" the leftovers, and a few minutes later I was handed back the food on a tray with fine china, with utensils and a glass of ice water, all for free! The hotel is in an absolutely perfect spot, near the waterfront, the convention center, Petco Park, and about 300 restaurants in the gas-lamp. It is convenient to use public transportation to get to the zoo, Balboa park, or Seaworld. We liked the Solamar so much, when our trip was supposed to end, I went to the front desk and inquired about extending our stay for 2 extra days. The manager let us stay in the same room, and gave us a discounted rate due to our loyalty. I will stay at Kimpton hotels from now on and the Solamar whenever I return to San DIego.

Cons: The modern bathroom sink has a high faucet and shallow sink, which means that water will ALWAYS splash on you/your clothes; The sink counter is simply too high for shorter people (I am 5'3\") so it's very hard to use; The room had a musty smell; There is no coffee maker in the room - only in the lobby - so if you need coffee before you face people for the day, you're out of luck; The room could really use more lights; No dresser (but large closet); Not enough staff at the pool bar/restaurant so you have to wait a long time to get served.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and even better staff\u201d", "Author": "SharonAJ", "ReviewID": "UR119653110", "Content": "We just got back from a West Coast trip which ended with 5 nights in San Diego.

Nothing they could do ... that is the part of San Diego I chose to stay in but this is just a heads up. My husband and I woke up early and went downstairs for the free coffee in the lobby and a quick smoke. The valet guy ran around looking for a lighter for us. Very nice ... We went for a swim about 10 am and the pool area was nice but was still a mess from the evening bar/club by the pool thing the night before. Only one staff member was casually putting pillow covers back on. Maybe I shouldn't judge as it was only 10 am.

I was met with kind, courteous, and attentive valet staff. Check-in at the counter was very helpful, professional, and organized. Though i had to wait for my room, when i received my room at 3pm it was spotless and tidy as usual. This is what one should expect from a 4.5-5 star hotel. The lobby of this hotel is amazing. Rich woods, comfortable chairs and sofas, it felt like home or better. There was free water and spritzers in the lobby, which was refreshing in the San Diego summer heat. However, the hotel lobby and rooms are well air-conditioned, making the Solamar a welcoming oasis from normal life. Katie or Kelsie (i think that was her name) was the nicest hotel clerk i've ever met. These people here will do whatever it takes to make your stay top-notch, leaving nothing to chance. I got to stay in the Master Suite this time, and it was worth every penny. Spa tub next to a window, just when does a hotel have that? The Suites could be larger but the price is already at a value. Affordable, not inexpensive but not expensive at all, considering the total package received. I'm a Kimpton In-Touch member and they give you $10 in room service snacks (it's called the \"Honor Bar\") so i always deduct $10 from the room price. These gestures by the hotel are nice, and nice needs to always be recognized. I totally recommend this Kimpton above all other Kimptons (although i recommend those too that i've stayed at), and definitely over 99% of all other hotels i've stayed at. The beds are super comfy, everything spotless and chic in the hotel, and there is not a single thing i can find wrong with anything the entire time during both my stays. The Solamar deserves a solid 5-star rating, even though it's considered a 4.5 star hotel. Thank you to all the wonderful staff at the Kimpton Solamar.

When I was checking in, my wife took my daughter to the lobby bathroom and there were 2 young women cleaning up and getting dressed for the day. Really? Either they walked in off the street or they got kicked out of their room and had no where else to get ready. And when I checked in I was told that because of the holiday the pool was for guests only. Again, really? Does that mean the pool is open to the public the rest of the time? Based on other reviews I was expecting the greatest customer service but in reality it was on par for any good hotel. And a cheap dollar store toy does not make it kid friendly. When I got there the bell/valet crew where helpful maybe a little over eager but nice. Check in was easy but room was not ready at 1:45 so they took my number and said they would call me. No call as of 3:00 so we walked back and as I standing in line I got the phone call (appx 3:15). I was told they were sold out so I could not get a room with 2 beds like I needed. I asked for a roll away and top floor which they gave me. Valet parking $36 a night. Directly across the street $25 for overnight parking. Room was clean but not very big and not very practicable and the roll away was waiting in the room for me. Honor bar not a smart idea with younger children who will be tempted. Bathroom small and also not practicable with a raised sink which makes it impossible to wash your face without having water go everywhere and again not kid friendly. My biggest problem was with the pool area. The area is so tiny pool super small no chairs pool super heated. I felt like I was at the Hard Rock or a frat party with all the 20 something drunk barely clothed people there having conversations how they had sex they night before. Kid friendly? Not so much. And while the guests did not seem to mind my kids there it is not a proper environment for ANY kid no matter age. Staff (security) seemed to be there to hook up with the guests.

We had a King Suite for the first 4 nights and loved it. Room 1017. The room was nice and large and super quiet. We never heard anything, except for someone getting ice one night across the hallway. Bed slept wonderful and everything was super clean. Outside our window we could see Petco Park to the right. The one problem we had with this room was the TV signal kept going out. We called the front desk and they sent someone up right then to check on it and said it couldn't be fixed, it was just a bad reception in that room. So after four days of the TV going off in the middle of a program, I asked the front desk to move us. Which they did, but to another King Room, (1027) not a suite. They didn't have another King Pet Free Suite availiable for us. We asked for a Pet Free room when we made reservations at the Solamar and found out that the top two floors at this hotel are Pet Free. And there is only one King Suites on each of these two floors. Anyway, the King Room that they moved us too was just as nice and have a view of the pool area. And yes, the TV worked great. They also discounted our last two night there because of the TV problem. We are really picky about where we stay and we felt the Hotel Solamar meet all our needs. Solamar is on 6th Street and if you walk one street over onto 5th Street you can find every kind of place you could think of too eat, just wonderful. The Broken Yoke is a short walk down 6th Street, wonderful for breakfast and lunch. Get there before 8 am and beat the morning breakfast rush.

Although he'd hoped to secure premium rooms, the hotel was at capacity and we received two standard rooms across the hall from each other on the top floor. The property: This is a new looking and feeling hotel, in a great location for access to Petco Stadium and the good restaurants in the Gaslamp Quarter. The lobby is very nice with fireplaces, comfortable seating and a quiet relaxing vibe. The best feature is the pool deck with its cabanas, bar and seating area. Although the pool is not large and there aren't as many loungers as might be needed for a lot of guests to sun and swim, it is lovely place to spend the day, with a nice selection of food and drinks available and pretty good service most of the time. The standard room: I had a king room facing the pool deck on the top floor. It was a nice enough view of the pool and Petco, as well as the streets of the Gaslamp district. Being able to open the window for some fresh air was a nice little feature, although on Saturday evening, the bar was lively enough that I had to shut the window for some shuteye.

The bathroom is small with combo tub/show, but pretty and with the necessary conveniences along with nice towels, good shampoos and bath gel and the (best blow dryer ever...)

Plain and simple. My boyfriend and I are beach people, but as a cost-saving measure we decided to book the first night of our three night stay in San Diego at a downtown hotel (Solamar). It was love at first sight, and that was just the beginning. The staff are exceptional - friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. I was greeted with a smile whenever and wherever I ran across an employee. The little extras? 1. Unlimited ice cold chamomile apple juice iced tea at check-in. AMAZING. Having a little sip of magnificence after a rough flight was just what I needed. 2. A hosted happy hour with a red wine, white wine, AND sangria. My group of three all selected the Voigner before seeing the sangria option. We were totally bummed, assuming we had missed our one shot at a beverage that looked earth-shatteringly incredible. NOPE! Before we finished plotting a way to beg the \"bartender\" for a small sip of the sangria, he offered to top us all off. And by top us all off, I mean completely refill our empty glasses. We told him we would love to try the sangria instead, and he poured us three heaping glasses of the magical elixir. It was a pink sangria made with watermelon and strawberry puree, Grand Marnier, Triple Sec, and a few other odds and ends. I have never tasted anything that good in my life. 3. A pool and lounge area that is lively during the afternoon and evening, but dead quiet in the early morning as the sun begins to shine down upon it. It's a perfect place for a morning tea and a book read. 4. A leopard robe in the room (wish there had been two of them though...) The rooms are hip, modern, spacious, and fun to spend time in. They do not smell like hotel (you know what I mean), and they actually made me forget about the beach for a while, which is a near impossible feat. My one complaint (and it's a tiny one) is that the walls are a bit thin. I could hear the people next door singing Marine songs to their kid (a new recruit?) until the wee hours. The windows are solid though -- When shut you can't hear any of the pool noise below (at least not from the 9th floor). All in all, a solid 5 stars, a GREAT deal for the money, and you can't beat the downtown location -- just steps from the Padres field and The Mission (one of the best breakfasts in town).

We actually think this is the BEST service and value for our money we have ever received.

The staff were able to accommodate our many requests re room specifications here. Every time we leave and return we are greeted warmly with a huge smile from the staff. No request is too much trouble. They have gone above and beyond the normal level of service offered in a hotel. When we asked about shipping some items home to Canada the wonderful young lady at reception personally asked the gentlemen at the doors what we needed to do and returned with forms for us to complete and return to them. They would do the rest! Not to worry! My husband got ill (nothing serious, but he did require medication) and we asked where we could go for medical help, not only did we get directions to Urgent Care printed out for us, but our wonderful Erica called the office for us to let them know we were on our wY, making sure they would still be open for us! Upon our arrival at this hotel, we were very warmly welcomed by Kyle who answered all of our questions, making sure that our room requests were met!

I booked online under the Sun and Sea internet special which gave me $30 to spend anywhere in the Hotel ranging from in-suite dining/room service to valet parking. As a Kimpton In-Touch member (sign up is Free), i also received a $10 credit to the \"Honor Bar\" which is the snack and mini-fridge menu. Coming from San Francisco, it was a long drive. I was met by very courteous and attentive valet parking staff. After tipping the valet to take care of my car $5, i was assisted by the bell hop Garrett, who was very friendly and polite. A nice gal name Katie, who had greeted me and checked me in at the Front Desk, had fulfilled by request for a Corner Spa Suite, which when Garrett and i had unloaded my things at the room, was an excellent Corner Unit to say the least. After tipping Garrett $5 for his kind and professional help, I took a tour of the unit. The views were 180 degrees, 9 floors up (10 floors total in this Kimpton) and excellent looking into Petco Park, where the San Diego Padres play home games. There was a roar from the crowds as i was unpacking, as someone from the Padres had just hit a homerun after the 7th inning stretch. Of course, if you could imagine, there were bars around the park next to the Kimpton. There was the Fleetwood and the Bub, right outside the corner suite where you could look down and see the patrons. So if you want a quiet room, either close the windows (you couldn't hear any noise if you shut the windows of this unit and used the A/C) or request a Corner Suite on the other side of the hall. The Corner Suite was spacious and richly appointed. There was a nice, big soaking tub, which was jetted as well. I actually used this Spa jet tub at the end of the night and it just put me to sleep right after. One of the best sleeps i'd enjoyed in a long time. The reason: the beds. These beds like most Kimptons are the most enjoyable beds to sleep on. They are just the right amount of firmness and super clean and fresh smelling. There was a HDTV LCD for viewing enjoyment, a DVD player, liquers available, wine, champagne, Organic cookies, nuts, etc. These Kimptons are inviting and well-thought out. Efficient. Value. Superb service and hospitality at the right value-oriented price point. At least that is the impression i get every time i book and leave a Kimpton. I leave feeling i got a good deal, a wonderful experience, and wanting to book again anytime i'm in a City that has a Kimpton. In fact, that's what i do these days. The Hotel Solamar is one of the most luxurious Kimptons i've booked. The lobby is just spectacular. As with every Kimpton i've stayed at, there was a wine reception hour from 5-6pm. This reception at the Solamar was superb as usual. My female counterpart was extremely delighted. I wholeheartedly recommend yet another Kimpton. The Kimpton Solamar's staff will impress, and once you see the interior decor and stay in the comfortable rooms you will wonder why you only had to pay so little for all of it. By far, of any other hotel chain i've stayed at, the best pound-for-pound all-around deal for its price. These Kimptons are going to devour other hotel chains in this Recession. They will come out of this Recession as a top hotel chain, and to be perfect honest, i think they deserve to me. This benchmark of excellence should apply to all hotels.

The second was the non-functional pretty bathroom. The sink was sooo annoying. Every time you tried to wash your face the entire sink area would be wet.

We were clearly told we are a third party guest and requests cannot be accommodated. We did not feel as welcome but it was worth the saved money. Once we arrived our request for a pet free room was met and we were treated with care and dignity. We had a great room on the 10th floor that even had a peek-a-boo view of the marina. We went down to the roof top pool after dark in our suits and were embarrassed to find no hot tub and a party crowd at the bar fully clothed. No one was in the pool and we would have felt out of place so we returned to our room. We ate lunch at Mary Jane's in the Hard rock hotel in walking distance. Fabulous food! Best cheeseburger ever. I am not a foodie but could not stop talking about it. My husband had a breakfast meal that he quite enjoyed. We went to Broken Yolk right next to the hotel for breakfast the following morning. We had heard they got rewarded as a best breakfast place in San Diego. We were very disappointed. The waffle was nothing more than an ego waffle, the egg looked microwaved, and we received very poor service. I'd definitely walk down to Mary Janes for a much better breakfast. Enjoyed walking in Gaslamp Quarter. We had dinner at the Spaghetti Factory. Seaport Village is also in walking distance and quite lively during the day. I even walked Down Seaport to get a glimpse of our cruise ship In the morning. There were a lot of exersizers out. I enjoyed the morning walk along the marina. We took the ferry to Coronado. If you do this be sure to read the times it picks up before buying the tickets. We had to wait an hour. We had a great time in Coronado then we returned at the time our ferry driver had told us a ferry would be there. We ended up on a ferry going downtown to the other location. The driver was very mean to us when we asked if the ferry would continue on to where we got on. We had to get off and walk. It took us an hour to walk to where we had got on. However, we actually enjoyed walking along Seaport Village. In the future I'd probably get a taxi or rental car. Anyway, point being the opportunities surrounding Solamar are limitless.

This is our first stay in a \"trendy\" hotel and while it's not our thing (we perfer historic/old skool hotels) it was a very nice treat. The downside: You'll have to either order room service for coffee ($5 for a cup) or get your own in the lobby as there is NO in-room coffee pot -a shame for paying $300 a night. The couch was uncomfortable, and there is a $35 per night validated car park. Although the bathroom was outstanding and had the best view of the city, the mirror had streaks on it and the shower is in need of a good scrubdown as it was very slippery. The sink was not practical as water splashed all over yourself, the counter and the mirror.

This was for a 3-day getaway to celebrate our 19th wedding anniversary. Per recommendations on this site, we signed up for the Kimpton InTouch loyalty program...which proved to be a great move. We were given a $10 credit to the mini-bar and free wi-fi. How cool is that? The hotel itself is really wonderful, pristine, great decor (classy but not stuffy). We were a bit apprehensive about the fact that they allow pets (we had a truly miserable experience at another hotel years ago...dog in adjacent room barked...and barked...and barked some more), but it turns out that the top two floors are \"reserved for 2-legged guests only\". Hotel staff had set aside a quiet room on the top floor for us, and included complimentary wine & chocolates for my wife & I. Very classy touch. The only drag was parking. It's valet only, and costs $35/day. Many downtown hotels charge for parking these days (kinda the hotel industry version of baggage fees, I suppose), but it really is a bummer - particularly when they don't even offer self parking. I suggested to them that part of the Kimpton loyalty program perks could be a discount on the parking rate...I think that would go a long way toward generating loyalty!

I've stayed in several Kimpton hotels and I am never disappointed. The hotel is in a great location right in the Gaslamp district and you can walk to many different restaurants. The hotel had some nice guest perks like free coffee and chai tea bar in the morning, free afternoon hot chocolate bar, free evening wine reception. My room was spacious, very clean and nicely decorated with touches that were inspired by the locale. As a Kimpton InTouch member, I was treated very well. Prior to my arrival I received an email from someone on guest relations saying they were looking forward to my stay and asking if I needed anything prior to arrival. There was a note from the hotel in my room offering me $10 to raid the mini bar. I even got a hand written note from the cleaning woman. I ate in the hotel's outdoor bar/lounge on my first night and the food and cocktails were great. I even got a huge discount on my food by checking in on Foursquare. I used the gym 3 out of the 4 days I was there and it was clean. My only complaint is that the temperature in the gym was very hot. Also on one of the nights, it was loud late into the night and I couldn't tell if it was a guest in an adjacent room or people in the outdoor pool/bar area. I eventually fell asleep so it wasn't a huge deal. Also if you are a dog lover, you will love this hotel but more importantly if you are not, like me, you will still enjoy your experience. When I first checked in it was around the time of their daily dog happy hour and there were dogs all over the lobby area. I immediately was turned off as I am not a dog person but the manager assured me I was on a pet-free floor and that the dog happy hour is only a short time in the afternoon. Since I left the hotel in the morning for work and didn't come back until the early evening, it never became an issue as I never did see another dog. Overall I loved the hotel and will definitely stay there when I return to San Diego for another trip, and I will of course keep staying at Kimpton hotels whenever possible.

From the airport, the driving time was about 15 mins. Be warned that the hotel does not have a designated self park, and valet parking is somewhere around $35 per day. We were able to find free parking at parking meters around the hotel every night except for Saturday when the nightlife in the district was very busy. After being stuck in traffic and circling around for a couple times, we ended up parking in a parking lot several blocks away for $15 overnight. There're restaurants and boutique shops around the area, in daytime the area is pretty quiet. We went to Coronado, SeaWorld, SD zoo, wildlife animal park, legoland, etc... All within close driving distance. Farthest we had to drive to the destination was probably 40 mins. We liked the ambiance and interior design and layout of the hotel. However, we were disappointed with the service. The housekeeper did not do a good job with keeping up with supplies in the room. Everyday, there was something missing: it was either toilet paper, or lotion, or other random things. When we did ask for the supply, it would take a long time for the items to arrive to our room. It also seems like they didn't put much effort making the bed. Apparently the hotel maid did not like re-arranging the pillows; the pillows were left at the corner of the bed every day when we returned to hotel. I guess the maid just didn't bother putting that finishing touch. The nice part of the hotel is that there's complimentary coffee and tea everyday in the lobby. However, the staff who's responsible for maintaining the station looked like she was about to kill someone. It wasn't hard to tell she hated her job. When I was at the station making my tea, I guess I was in her way and she just stood there staring at me with an attitude. I looked back and asked if I was in her way, she just said no and went away to do something else... Pretty unusual experience for a hotel with this star rating. There is a complimentary wine hour at the hotel too, I believe it was from 5-6. We've never tried it because we were always out doing something. Despite the negative experience with the housekeeping and unfriendliness of staff, I wouldn't mind staying at this hotel again if I can book at the same rate again ($99 per night through Hotwire).

Arrived on Labor Day (national holiday apparently?) the day after our wedding and after two flight totally 13hrs and needless to say shattered at around 5pm only to find our room wasn't ready and we would have to wait 10-15mins for it to be ready, that then turned into 30mins and got told we could relax by the pool and they would let us know when it was ready, headed to the pool which was pumping music like a beach party, no problem as we were just happy to find a seat, 45mins later we headed back down and then got told that he by the same receptionist that it would be would only another 15mins as he had been dealing with something else, finally at just after 6 we got our room throughout the saga, we were almost made to feel like we were to blame. The Hotel and the room itself were fantastic and the quality and cleanness of the room were top quality and couldn't be faulted, we had a bottle of champagne and a happy birthday card???? Which magically later in the day to a Comgratulations card! Which was a nice touch. One of the first things we did find however was that the safe didn't work, which with our passports and cash etc we sure needed. Reported on the phone and were told we could go out and Maintence would repair, that evening when got back it still wasn't fixed, so called again in the morning to ask again and when still not repaired that evening asked reception for 3rd time. Still wasn't repaired so gave up asking!! wine hour was a nice touch, was served most evenings by a lady from the phillipenes who was lovely whenever we saw her, unfortunately on the Tuesday after a long day at the Zoo, there was a older blonde lady serving who was simply Rude and was possible the rudest person we came across, at first we thought she disliked us for bring a younger crowd, however when speaking to other guests in the lift we weren't the only people to notice this. The pool area itself was lovely and offered lovely views over the Gaslamp, unfortunately service wasn't much better when we did visit with the barman being more interested in the baseball game on, than any customers. finally when we did get home to the uk, we checked our credit card statement to find we'd been double billed for our stay, so after long call trying to get someone to help from within the hotel a voicemail was left and the problem that should never happen was resolved quickly. Overall we lovely San Diego, the Hotel we loved and the rooms were lovely, the Valet staff were friendly and the cleaning staff very nice but unfortunately too much poor customer service soured our visit.

The Solamar is in an excellent position right in the center of the Gaslamp district with plenty of bars, restaurants and shops to choose from. When we first checked in the hotel, our first impression was how dark it was in the lobby, when we stayed at the San francisco hotel we were given complementary continental breakfast vouchers as we were with Virgin holidays, these were not offered to us at the Solamar until i had enquired about them. When we entered our room (606) the first thing we noticed was the mouldy smell of the room, we dont understand where this smell came from as the room was clean and there was no sign of mould in the bathroom but it was quite unpleasant. Some other points about the room that we were unhappy about were : the lighting in the room, there was a bedside light which is great as i like to read before i go to sleep, however, to use the bedside light you have to turn the main light of the room on that is by the door so, when you want to turn the light out you have to get out of bed again. This is the first hotel i have been to where there is no hotel guide in the room, it is handy to know what time the pool, restaurant etc opens and closes and to know what time you are to check out. There is nowhere in the room to put your wet towels after you have used them, there were 4 of us in our room,so 4 wet towels and one small towel rail, so we had to have wet towels hanging over doors. While we were there only one elevator was working which resulted in very long waits aspecially in the mornings, it was out of order for the 4 days we were there and we never saw anyone working on it. Whilst the wine hour is a very nice idea, who when they are on holiday is in the hotel between 5-6, each day at this time we were still at the zoo, beach etc it would have been nicer if it was a little later. There was no coffee machine in the room and no way of getting a cup of coffee in the hotel, except for in the mornings unless i suppose you got a very expensive cup through room service. If you choose not to put coffee machines in the room surely there should be a way of getting a coffee, tea etc in the hotel. The rooms are very noisy, you can hear every door being shut in the corridor, also on the Friday and Saturday nights that we stayed, opposite the hotel was a roof top bar that was very loud until the early hours of the morning, keeping us awake. Our window in our room was so dirty it was impossable to see out of it, just as well as the view out of our window was a brick wall. Finally the cost of parking at this hotel is ridiculous, we stayed in LA, Las Vegas and Palm Springs on this vacation and parking was free at all the hotels, $35 a night to park is very expensive. We parked at the garage 1 block down on the same side of the hotel for $17 a night.

We were looking forward to staying at The Solamar in San Diego while visiting family and were especially appreciative of Kimpton's marketing efforts and special programs for GLBT visitors. The chain is to be applauded for that. This specific hotel, though, was a bit of a disappointment. Like a previous reviewer noted, some of the disappointments were minor (most were, actually) and some were down-right frustrating for a hotel of this quality. Valet parking anywhere in a major metropolitan area is expensive. We did gulp a bit at the $35/night valet rate. In general valet attendants were efficient and friendly. A couple, however, were abrupt with comments like, \"Call earlier. It'll be 15-20 minutes before we can get your car.\" During the time we stayed at the Solamar the property appeared to be at capacity, yet they were down to just one elevator. This created incredible lines for the lift in the lobby and on each floor of the hotel ... day and night. When we inquired about the location of the stairway, we were given a vague response. We finally found the stairway, but kind of shook our heads at the lack of attention to service. As many have noted, the pool area is superb. It was fun to hang out there on a Friday night, people watch, enjoy a cocktail, and enjoy the sunshine. Again, some staff members were friendly and professional, others were surly or aloof. Our king guest room was on the smallish side, but the most concerning piece of the room itself was the incredibly uncomfortable bed. I spend about 70% of my time on the road and am very accustomed to lots of variation in hotel bedding. This was the worst bed I've had in months and reminded me of beds I encounter when I'm stuck in motel in some small berg in the middle of nowhere. It sagged tremendously on the sides, provided no support, and produced a very uncomfortable night's sleep for both of us. The lack of bath soap, etc in the bathroom didn't bother us. In fact, I appreciate that the hotel uses pump shampoo, conditioner, and body wash instead of individual soaps and bottles of liquids. It's much more ecological. The bathroom did, however, have a lingering mildew smell. We couldn't find any mildew, but it was definitely on the nose. In actuality, the bathroom decor is gorgeous, but not all that functional. The sink, for example, is quite modern but does not drain well (due to design, not a plumbing issue) and splashes water all over the place. The toilet paper, as another reviewer mentioned, is scratchy, but we accepted this as the hotel uses an ecological toilet paper product. As another reviewer mentioned, too, we were baffled by the lack of a hotel guide in the guest room, a TV channel guide, or even a pad of paper and a pen. Checkout was painfully slow and inefficient. I waited and waited for a charge from the hotel's restaurant (JSix) to show up on our folio, even though it had been a hour since we left the restaurant. The hotel staffer just kept asking me to wait and she would check the folio in between helping other guests. There had to be a better way to handle this.

I've also stayed in their DC property, and enjoy the young vibe, funky style, and elegant modernism of the hotels. Solamar did not disappoint.

The bed was a little too lumpy and soft for both mine and my wife's tastes, so our sleep wasn't as comfortable as we would've liked. The pool area on the 4th floor was wonderful to enjoy. We had lunch there and a few frozen cocktails. Were a bit astounded at the price of the cocktails when we got the bill though -- you do pay for all of that style. So maybe forgo the alcoholic drinks here and enjoy them in one of the many fine, local restaurants. A nice touch is they'll print out and display a photo you send them ahead of time to make you feel more at home. One of those personal touches that anyone could do on their own, but since they thought of it, it made it seem even more special. The Internet was fine. The only tiny thing was the designers who insist on using sliding doors in bathrooms (when there was plenty of room in this room for a regular door). Sliding doors are great for doors you don't open or close very often, because they tend to be harder to open and close, and if not perfectly aligned, they don't always close tight. Case in point was in our room, where there was a very noticeable crack when the bathroom door was closed because the door was no longer level.

I noticed their were down pillows on the bed which I am desperately allergic to and before I could call down my phone rang. It was one of the girls at the front desk greeting me with a sincere greeting and asked if I needed anything. I let them know about the pillows, they were very apologetic and assured me knew pillows would be up soon. It took about 15 minutes.

The gentleman at the front desk was very professional calm and apologetic. He let me know that someone would be up as soon as possible. I was waiting outside to point security to the right room and 2 gentleman, a stockier guy and a blonde guy who appeared to be security.

I love the review posted by the guy below, regarding the poolside being like the set of a beer commercial, he\u2019s not wrong! I think that was a very creative way to describe it and so correct too! A small heated pool, surrounded by contemporary loungers with gaudy towels, palm trees and seating areas dotted all over, and a great looking bar with lots of people enjoying a beer in the sunshine with a few tunes. Saturday night was our favourite night, the pool bar and terrace (Lounge-six) gets packed with partygoers and was one of our best nights partying. Only one thing spoilt it and that\u2019s drinks being served in plastic glasses, yack. Our room overlooked the poolside terrace but with the window closed you could not hear any noise at all. To the right of the ample worktop/dresser, i found the minibar to be probably the best stocked minibar i\u2019ve ever seen. It had everything, a massive selection of different drinks and loads of snacks too. I was very happy to see that it was actually quite well priced and not a rip off like some hotels. The beds were really comfy with quality linen and the bathrooms were superb with a super powerful shower. We stayed on a bed and breakfast board basis and the breakfast was served downstairs in the hotel restaurant called J-six. Each morning a continental breakfast was served which my wife thoroughly enjoyed, but i wanted something a little more substantial. There was an option to upgrade (for a small fee) to the All American Breakfast, and i can honestly say that it was the very best breakfast i have ever experienced in any hotel i have ever visited (and that\u2019s a lot!).

That said, it was a nice place to relax and spend an afternoon. My only complaint would be the noise: dogs barking in the wee hours of the night; then a pot-smoking, hip-hop-blasting jerk nextdoor. It took an hour of calling the front desk before this guy finally settled down around 1:30am. Meanwhile, our room (with a shared suite door) reeked of marijuana smoke. A bit of bad luck, I suppose.

I was shocked to find there was a $35 charge for \"valet parking\" for each day of the conference, a fee not stated in the terms of agreement. This increased the price of our stay to over $200 per day. This cost was not what our budget was planned for, since we had to stay the whole week for our class. Their statement that parking fees at $35/day are in line with fees throughout San Diego is not true; this hotel is not in New York city. The hotel itinerary mentioned a complimentary expanded continental breakfast to our hosts conducting our class, but I never did see it. The hotel attendants did not mention this to me when I checked in. I assumed that the hotel, particularly with its robust guest charges, had a continental breakfast, but during my first morning I had to order a breakfast at the hotel restaurant for an additional charge, and the time of waited service made me late for the class, so I forwent additional breakfasts for the remaining time I was at the hotel. Also, the wireless network was difficult to implement, both in the rooms and in the conference rooms. The hotel had a few types of wireless service, one of which was \"free internet,\" requiring a membership to the hotel, which by this time I did not want to join, as I did not want any future e-mails from the hotel. While I was eventually given an e-mail password to logon to the free wireless network, my laptop would frequently try to lock on the wireless service requiring a fee, since the free wireless was set to a weaker signal. I found the hotel requiring any wireless charges onerous, considering that most other hotels provide free service, and hotel charges at this place were at a premium. Finally, I found the hotel rooms lacking amenities, such as a simple coffee maker, and an empty refrigerator. The refrigerator and shelves were all stuffed with expensive drinks the guest was supposed to buy. Since there was no room to put my books up, I had to push all the drinks aside. I felt the hotel was more interested in alcohol sales than providing a functioning room for the guest. To add insult to injury, I was erroneously charged $11 at checkout for a water bottle they claimed I taken, but I had to use it to block the non-functioning safe's door from continuously swinging open.

The Valet staff was great moving cars and freeing up space for cars to enter. Had room service the first night which was good however there was a mandatory 22% gratuity on over priced food and a $3.00 delivery fee, which is excessive. The food was good and delivered in a timely manner for a friday night. The restaurant was nice we had breakfast there two mornings , standard breakfast menus with pleasant staff. The hotel was busy seems like one of the spots to stay , we saw a lot of guests with their pets and on SATURDAY the pool area is a outdoor club/lounge which gets noisy if your facing the pool/lounge area at night. The pool is small warm and nice with towels and sporadic drink service maybe around 15 lounges for guest use and a few covered cabanas.

The concierge had a very handy map with all the restaurants written on it and was more than happy to help us with recommendations.

I did the math and it would have been cheaper to park as a \"non guest\", what a joke! Coffee is only available in the lobby during certain hours, a negative in my opinion. Bed was nicely dressed with down comforter and great sheets, but the mattress was not up to par. How long has in been since they've made mattresses that bounce one side when the other moves? Every time my husband was up or down, I was flopped around. Perhaps Kimpton could order some Heavenly beds? Our room was a corner with three bright window that were able to open, a big plus in my book. There was plenty of room and even a nice closet with shelves and safe (and no mirrored door!). Bathroom was well appointed with Aveda bath products, average size tub and nice shower head. Bathroom had modern vessel sink and beautiful tile. The only down side was the lack of lighting near the bathtub/shower. Only lighting was around sink and a half wall blocked most of that light from getting to tub. No a big deal, but don't expect to do any precision shaving. They also host an afternoon wine reception, if you're into that. I'd pass the alcohol for better parking rates. We found it odd that a pet friendly hotel had no real green space for them to take care of \"business\" or play. They offered a tiny strip in the sidewalk that has obviously been overused bey their customers (and not even their property, city property). Petco park has a dog friendly area, but for quick morning and bedtime trips this hotel needs to find a better solution. The receptionist was also happy to allow us an early check-in(really early, 9 am), after an all night drive. Internet is free if you are a member of their Kimpton brand \"club\", you are able to sign up on the spot very easily. Otherwise $10/day. Pool and sun deck area on fourth floor looked really nice, although we did not have the opportunity to enjoy ourselves. We did see (from our room), movies playing one night against one wall, which looked fun. They also had several intimate fire pits and bar area. Great location if downtown is you destination. Petco park is about a half block away, lots of restaurants, close to shopping, though it's all chain/mall stores, so don't expect anything original. If you are going to the convention center, it's about a 5-10 minute walk. Great for business. If you're looking for family/beaches you better off in the mission bay area or be prepared to hop in the car.

Here\u2019s some wrinkles during a two-night stay in mid-August: .The so-called free internet service available to Kimpton In Touch guests never worked for us but we didn't pursue it after two inquiries with the front desk. .We stayed only two nights and on the second day, our room was still not \"made up\" at 2 pm which I thought was rather late so I had to call the front desk. In the hallway, housekeeping staff seemed to imply to me that their workload had recently increased. (Sounds like a cost-cutting move on the part of management.) Guests shouldn\u2019t have to wait until mid-afternoon when they return to the room to work or relax/nap to have housekeeping come in while using the room. .Parking is advertised on the website as $32 but is posted at the hotel entry as $35. (Either way, it\u2019s ridiculously overpriced!) The front desk claimed the rate changed either 2 or 3 months ago and that it has been updated on the website but remembering that I read it there only a month ago or less, I asked them to honor the prior advertised price. (Because the internet service didn\u2019t work for us, I couldn\u2019t check it during our trip). I had no less than four conversations with different front desk staff the first night and next morning before ascertaining that the parking staff (apparently, a separately-run business) approved the discount. Talking to so many different people was a major irritant -- couldn't the first person get the answer immediately? Now that we\u2019re home, I see that the website price is still $32 (on 8/20) \u2013 despite their claims that the increased price had been posted \u2013 but if Kimpton reads these reviews, it will get changed soon! .The bathroom is wonderful except the sink \u2013 a trendy design that causes water to splash everywhere because it\u2019s set so high. .The rooftop pool is small (and pretty chilly) with limited seating but we got lucky on a weekday and had a cabana to ourselves. In three hours time, staff never once walked around to pick up towels left behind on chaises that guests had left unoccupied for hours, which means late-comers think all lounges are taken. Staff should make sure guests aren't reserving chairs for long blocks of time. .When we checked out and were asked about our stay, I said \u201cthere were a few wrinkles\u201d but she never asked what they were or if I was ultimately satisfied with my stay.

The price for the central gaslamp district location looked too good to be true. I was expecting to be disappointed and for this to be one of those times when the photos looked better than the reality. I had looked at other quality hotels in the area and they were much more expensive, so wasnt expecting much. However, on arrival we checked in to a very classy and upmarket reception area and was greeted with complimentary wines and nibbles (offered to guests daily in the afternoons) and then we were delighted with the appointment of our room. Large king size bed and roomy room with a fridge. Very modern fittings and decor. We got a rollaway bed for our son and there was plenty of room for it. They didnt charge extra for it (most other hotels seem to charge a nightly fee for these). The bathroom was luxourious but did not have a full bath (it was 3/4 size). The air conditioning was very good and quiet. Large flat screen TV and good selection of channels. We were on the top floor and overlooked Pitco Park. There were baseball games and fireworks most night (very cool!)... but dispite this the room was very quiet (double glazing) and it didnt impact our stay in a negative way. In fact it was fun to watch. Great black out curtains helped get our son to sleep and sleep in in the mornings. The hotel offered a complimentary continential breakfast and although it wasnt quite what we were expecting it was a lovely start to the day. It comprised of a pastry, and lovely bowl of fresh fruit and coffee/tea. You could add other items from the menu for a cost. We enjoyed the rooftop pool although it is quite small and very popular in the afternoons. The staff were very helpful and freindly. The only real negative for me was that there were no guest laundry services (other than drycleaning for individual items). There were also no coin laundries nearby. The staff did not have a solution/suggestion when I enquired and I would have thought they would have been asked for directions etc before but I definatley felt like I was the first ever person to ask this question. I had to travel a long way by public transport to a pretty scarey district out of town to do this. The outside is an old brick building that looks like it could have been a firestation or something like that....it is extremely understated. Once you go inside you will be pleasantly surprised. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a good location near to public transport, shops, many many great resturants, the waterfront etc - but that is also on a budget.", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cVery pleased\u201d", "Author": "Jodie085", "ReviewID": "UR34833555", "Content": "I was very pleased with this hotel (especially considering the great deal I found).

We arrived at the hotel around 10AM and were able to get right in our room which was a nice surprise. Our room was tidy, clean and very comfortable.

There was a yoga class held there in the morning that people seemed to enjoy and plenty of sun and beverages for the remainder of the day. The hotel location was perfect for our needs. Within a short walking distance to the baseball park, convention center and numerous restaurants and shopping areas. This made staying here extremely convenient and easy. I can't say I have many gripes about the hotel. The elevators were sometimes slow and the hot water in my shower could have been a bit hotter, but it was not uncomfortable. As I said, the pool stayed pretty busy and I found it difficult to find an empty lounge chair on the weekends, so if you are looking to get a tan at your hotel pool, get there early to claim your spot.

The wine and cheese tasting in the evening and free tea and coffee in the lobby each morning is a nice touch - even if you don't use it, still makes you feel as if the hotel is really trying to make a good impression. Free newspapers each morning. There is free wifi - though a somewhat ridiculous setup process involving joining the Kimpton Club, which is free. On the up side my iphone automatically logged itself into another Kimpton hotels wifi when we were in San Francisco. Our room had two separate areas with a living room / bedroom set up. Neither room was huge but both had enormous televisions. The two areas had a sliding door so you could lock yourself off if you really wanted to. All the photos on Trip Advisor show a walk in shower in the rooms. Our room didn't have one. So if this is important to you I would make sure you request one when you book. There are nice touches in the room that make it seem like a more personal hotel rather than another big chain. From the distinctive bathrobes, to the pinboard where they place notes about what's going on in the hotel and around town. The pool and bar area on the rooftop is lovely during the evening sun. Though one night they closed half of it off for a private function. The only thing I'd really complain about is the valet parking. The hotel seems to have the most expensive parking in the city.

The hotel's website had the most expensive room rate and 1800hotels.com had by far the BEST and least expensive rate. I called the hotel's reservation line and they matched the rate that 1800hotels.com was offering. That saved us over $50/night. We checked right in upon arrival and the front desk staff and valet attendants were very friendly. Our room was on the 7th floor overlooking 6th street. The room was beautifully decorated with modern decor, huge flat screen TV, very comfortable bed with no top comforter - which we LOVED - just triple sheeting and throw pillows that matched the decor of the room. The bathroom was clean, very nice modern fixtures, Aveda amenities and white fluffy towels. The shower head was fabulous - almost like a steam shower with great water pressure. They have FREE in-room Wi-fi! That's a big plus! They have a wine reception every evening from 5 - 6pm offering a red, white and sangria. We went both nights and enjoyed our wine and good conversation in the 'living room'. Also, each morning they offer a coffee and tea reception until 9:30am. We didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant, but the pizza samples that we tried during the wine reception were very tasty. We also didn't use the pool, but we did have drinks out by the back area of the pool that overlooked the street. The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. We were close enough to walk to PETCO Park to see a baseball game (just around the corner). There are so many great restaurants, bars and shops within walking district of the hotel. Friday night we enjoyed a meal at Old Spaghetti Factory to carbo load before the 10K race the next morning. Then on Saturday night, we had dinner at one of our favorite restaurants, Sevilla. You can't beat the Sangria and tapas! On Sunday morning, we walked to Mary Jane's Coffee Shop, which is located next to the Hard Rock Hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be going there again on our next trip to San Diego. The only downside is the $32/night valet fee. Being from Vegas, I'm used to free valet parking. There is a $20/day parking lot across the street, but for safety reasons we opted to pay the $32/night fee.

Received a complimetnary welcome gift in the afternoon, which is always appreciated. Attended the wine hour friday before heading off to Joltn Joes nearby for dinner, drinks and sporting events.

I am a frequent visitor to san diego and will keep an eye out on special offers for the solamar since its is perfectly located to to an abundance of things in san diego.

On my way out the housekeeper on the floor(Very friendly btw) was cleaning the room next to mine so I asked if she could clean mine next since I was going to be going out to grab a bite. I wanted to allow her time to finish what she was doing, so I figured I could hang out at the pool area, watch the yankees game and have my sandwich while the room was getting cleaned. Unfortunately it turns out the pool also has a restaurant(all i had seen was a bar) and so she told me I could NOT bring outside food. Thats fine, BUT then on my walk out, i noticed A LOT of people with outside food. My room wasnt ready, so i ate in the living room area, headed back to the pool area to sit and watch the game and as i walked around most people lounging in the pool area had outside food. Perhaps the others choose not to follow the rules, but i never saw anyone else get spoken to like i did.

I was on a mom/daughter mini vacation with my 28 year old daughter. I originally chose the Solamar for the great promo rate I heard about on the weekend edition of the Today Show. They showcased the hotel as a hip hotel and I thought it would appeal to my daughter. However, I was very skeptical after I booked it because of all the negative reviews I had read here at tripadvisor. I must say that our experience/stay was wonderful. Both of us were a little leary about staying in a hotel that allows pets because we both have allergies. I called the hotel and the front desk assured me they had a whole floor devoted to pet free rooms. (However, I could not find a place to indicate that I wanted a pet-free room when I reserved on-line. So if it is an issue for you, call them directly and request it. ) I had read many complaints about noise from the pool/bar area so upon check-in I asked for a room on the \"quiet side.\" They did not have any rooms left on the quiet side of the pet-free floor, but would gladly move us to another floor that did have quiet side rooms available. The receptionist told us that the pet-free floor was the top floor of the hotel and that we would be far enough up from the pool/bar that noise should not be a problem. Obviously we could not stay in a pet friendly room and chose to stay with our original room, #1027, We could not have been happier. Our hotel room looked directly down on the pool/bar. We were able to watch the action without hearing any of the noise. For us, noise was not an issue at all. Previous reviews mentioned an unfriendly attitude among the staff. We did not find this to be the case. Everyone we encountered was helpful and friendly. Our room was very clean and up to date. Our housekeeper Maria was excellent. (We could tell she had the day off on Saturday. The room was clean, but not quite as well as when Maria made it up.) The front desk was very friendly and helpful at check-in. At night there is an evening wine reception in the \"Living Room\". They offered a white and a red Pinot on all four nights. It was not top drawer wine. But,judging by the crowd people did not seem to mind the quality of the free wine one bit. I thought the wine reception was a nice touch. I would like to suggest that they do not always serve the same exact wine every night. Maybe they could mix it up with a different red such as a Cab , Malbec, or possibly a Merlot and then a Charddonay for a white option. Something different for those of us who are staying more than one night. Still that is a minor complaint and free wine is better than no wine at all. We also received a bottle of wine at check-in that was part of our promo rate. Again, a nice touch. And we received coupons for free continental breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Someone mentioned in a review that they did not like that wait staff served you your continental breakfast because they felt obligated to leave a tip. We did not mind being served and leaving a tip. Juice or coffee, several choices of a pastry, and a beautiful fresh fruit bowl was the complimentary continental breakfast. I do not know if every guest automatically gets continental breakfast. But even with a tip, it was an inexpensive way to jumpstart the day. And if you are a big breakfast eater, you could always order something in addition to your fruit and pastry off their breakfast menu which we did one day. Of course, you have to pay for anything extra beyond the continental breakfast. I should mention that they also have free coffee and tea in the morning in the \"Living Room\". I am not a coffee drinker, but my daughter took advantage of this nice amenity. Some reviews mentioned that the pool was not clean. The weather was chilly when we were there, but people were using the pool. It looked very clean and we overheard a guest saying the water temperature was warm. We did not use the pool, but did enjoy relaxing by it one afternoon after a day of sightseeing. I am guessing the pool gets more use in the summer and more sunscreen residue probably builds up on the sides of the pool. If that were to happen, that would be a turn off for me as well. I loved the location of this hotel. It is close to public transportation and the PETCO stadium. We were able to walk from here to Little Italy with no problem. (On a hot day you would probably want to take the light rail public transportation known as the Trolley to Little Italy.) We also attended a baseball game at PETCO during our stay. It was nice not to have to hassle with finding a parking space near the stadium. Other reviews mentioned the cost of valet parking. We did not have a rental car so I cannot comment on this. A previous review said the fitness room was small. It is small, but I never had to wait for a treadmill. There are 2 treadmills, 1 eliptical, weights, and then a bike is actually outside adjacent to the fitness room. One morning one of the treadmills did not have any power, but a hotel employee promptly came in and fixed it. Finally, there are many restaurants and night clubs in the area. We ate at a couple of them. But our best meals were brunch at Hash House A Go Go in Hillcrest and dinner at the Top of the Fish Market. We took a taxi to Hash House A Go Go. It cost us $10.90 and I gave the driver $15. We took the Trolley to the Seaport Village stop and walked the rest of the way to the Fish Market on Saturday night. It was a lovely night and we ended up walking all the way back to the hotel after our dinner. I should mention that we did have a king room. I was prepared for a tiny room because of some of the other reviews. Maybe because I was on a cruise about four weeks ago, but I thought the room size was very adequate. The bathroom sink is annoying-very contemporary and shallow. I think you can see it on the hotel's website. Someone said it is too high. I would disagree with that. I am short and height isn't the issue. One, it is set too far back, but the real issue is that it is too shallow and water splashes every where. It does however look cool. For the promo rate and all the other pluses this hotel had to offer, the sink was tolerable for days. I know this review is long, but I hope it will help somebody who was on the fence about lodging. I am a very picky traveler who prefers 4 and 5 star hotels and who is obsessed with cleanliness. (The carpets in the hallways did look worn, but our carpet in the room was new.)

The staff was so friendly that it was almost annoying, especially since we had been up since 4 am getting to the airport and flying to San Diego.

The good: 1. I was able to get a good two-day rate on the Kimpton website ($158.00) which is probably the only reason why I'm here. With the economy, my company is really scrutinizing my travel expenses. 2. The location is also convenient for food and walking around the Gaslamp District and it's less than three miles from the airport. 3. The decor is contemporary, but cold. Most Kimptons that I have been to are stylish and contemporary but not cold. I couldn't put my finger on it. 4. Nice big flat-screen TV. The not so good: 1. Yes, the location is convenient, but it's also really noisy. I don't know if other rooms are the same, but ask for a quiet room if they have one. 2. The bathroom sink is really high...so this is not so good for me at 5'3\" but might be great for someone that's 6'3\". Water splashes everywhere because the sink is too shallow and gets all over my things. The bathroom was clean, but generally smallish. 3. The hotel includes internet with the room cost, except there is no wireless or too weak of a signal. You have to be hard-wired to the internet cable which restricts your mobility. This irks me. 4. Valet parking is $32.00 a night...kind of an oxymoron decision to stay here for the cheaper room rate, but throw in parking...and well...you're back up to where you wanted to avoid in price. The Bad 1. The king-sized bed in my room was so uncomfortable, I barely slept. It dips on either side, and is slightly raised in the middle. Basically the bed felt like it was 100 years old and need to be thrown out. 2. The nice comforter I'm used to from Kimpton turned out to be so worn down and thin, I thought they forgot to include a comforter in my bed. I basically had to get up at 3am and put on my fleece jacket, because I was freezing to death. 3. No IN-room coffee. So I ordered room service for breakfast, and my coffee that came with room service tasted like water. I couldn't believe how weak it was for $4, plus 22% gratuity, plus $3 service charge. I probably could have bought a coffee maker for that price. They do serve coffee in the lounge in the morning until 9:30am, but who wants to go down there in the morning when there's work to do or in my case trying to get a little more sleep due to the lumpy bed? In summary: I'm not coming back...based on the bed issue alone...and I really wanted to like this place. I still gave this place a good rating, because it is MOSTLY good for the average person on vacation...really bad for business person. There might be better beds in other rooms, and I just happened to have the worst room in the house.

My biggest complaint was with a lady that was working the front desk overnight. When we arrived I requested rooms with two queen beds. We were told that there were none available (which was okay). After completing our stay I realized that the hotel was very empty for our entire stay. I also requested extra keys as we had a larger party. I was told that they were out of keys and could only provide one per room! The next night, we came back a little late and we needed our room key to get into the front door. Because we were only given one key, we didn't have a key with us and the same lady that checked us in quickly offered us TWO extra keys (one for each of our rooms). After pulling up our room in the computer, she handed me ONE key and said goodnight. The next day, I found out that the new key worked just fine, but the original key had been deactivated!! After asking I was quickly given extra keys for both rooms by a much nicer girl at the front desk (during the day). I hope it was just a coincidence or computer error but if she pulled this because we got a good deal on the rooms she should be fired or Solamar should not sell rooms through Priceline. My other big complaint was with the stench in the hallway. Many times when we returned to our rooms we could immediately smell the stench of bathroom (#2) as soon as we entered the hallway. The vent that is near the elevator must be for the bathrooms as you can see it as soon as you get off of the elevator. Even our guests immediately noticed this. Also, the $32 valet service was not what I expected for that price. The valets were friendly, but we waited way too long for our cars to be retrieved (up to 10 minutes).

The rooms are nice, but as couple posters have said, no dressers and that is slightly inconvenient if you have a longer stay as we did - 5 nights. But beds were comfy. The best part of hotel is staff. The front desk staff were amazing. Even when we had minor complaints or maybe requests, they tried to be as accomodating as possible and never made us feel they were put out. We did move once because we stayed during Halloween and a loud street concert was going on right out our window. They moved us to 10th floor which they didn't have to do. The view was amazing. City, litte of the ocean. Right now there is some construction going on at properties near the hotel. The only time it even bothered me was during the weekday by the pool. Hard to relax with the construction noise. Valet parking is pricey ($32) but if you go in and out a lot, its probably worth it than trying to find public parking. So much is within walking distance. Restaurants, Petco Park (for summer events especially), nice mall. All in all, I would recommend the hotel. I have heard that some rooms experience noise from the pool bar but I would think it would have to be extremely busy for that to happen. And yes, some ocassions they do close the pool to guests to accomodate a private party which does put you off a little. They only did that once during our stay so we didn't mind.

We chose it because so many of the other hotels in the Gaslamp area were extremely overpriced, and we were looking for a hotel with a nice pool.

The maids always did a good job of keeping the room in order, although they never seemed to leave us enough towels (2 towels for 2 ppl isn't enough in my opinion)...so we just requested more, which was no problem. The hotel is busy. There are lots of people there at night, especially in the pool area. Our friends had a room over the pool and they said that the noise at night wasn't an issue. The pool is beautiful and gets great sun. However, there isn't much space for lounging. They have about 6 lounge chairs out, and 3 cabanas. One day we arrived in the afternoon and there was no place to lie out. When I asked the bartender where we were supposed to sit, he kindly offered up the cabana for free (for which they normally charge $250 per day). On our last day we also noticed that they had a stack of lounge chairs behind the bar, which you can take and set up if you want to. The pool was pretty and a lot of fun! The hotel is within walking distance to some clubs, restaurants and bars, and they offer you free coffee and tea in the morning, which is a nice touch. Now for my gripes. I didn't find the hotel to be overly functional. I compare it to a really hot girl without a brain. The rooms looked nice but there was no good area for putting on makeup, and there was a lack of counter space and shelving. The pool looked beautiful, but the lack of sitting space was a bit annoying and somewhat stressful. They have sex kits for purchase in the room - lubricant, condoms, etc. I guess paying $7 for a sex kit when in dire need is worth it, but I don't need to be reminded of the thousands of people who have had sex in the bed that I'm paying $150 per night for! Yuck! They also have these strange leopard housecoats for purchase. These two things made me think that the hotel might secretly be frequented by pimps and people with weird sexual fetishes. Finally, parking was $30 per day - insane! We had no real problems with this hotel, but I just didn't find it functional enough overall.

I read some of the previous reviews about the bizarre pool scene. I checked out the pool every day and night we were there which included a Saturday. I didn't see anything that was bizarre. All I saw was a few people having a drink at the bar and other guests sitting in lounge chairs reading. And, as my husband who teaches English pointed out, \"they weren't even very racey books!\" There are a lot of great hotels in San Diego, but if Hotel Solamar is conveniently located to what you want to do in the area, I highly recommend it. Also, I would suggest not renting a car for any downtown hotel unless it is a must. The hotel parking fees are all about the same whether you are at the Hyatt, Marriott, or Solamar, and how many times are you going to use a car? The public transportation system is sufficent to get you anywhere within the downtown area; we found taxis are not that expensive.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NEW YORK", "Title": "\u201cThe Hotel Solamar and Meeting San Diego\u201d", "Author": "CFANTAUZZI", "ReviewID": "UR19282160", "Content": "This August was our first trip to San Diego so we picked this hotel and it was just fantastic.

The pool has hardly any beds but at the weekend when it fills up with obnoxious drunk people that the DJ brings with him you cant get a spot in the pool nevermind a sun lounger. They also rent out the cabanas so you may arrive down at 9 in the morning to be greeted with reserved signs on all the beds which sit their idle for most of the day because even when the beautiful people who booked them arrive they only want to be seen drinking in the pool.

Unfortunately there are so many problems with the property that I cannot imagine staying here again. We arrived on a very early flight and had asked for an early check in which ended up being no problem. We were in town for a wedding and told by the groom that a gift bag had been delivered to our room but to our dismay there was no gift bag in our room or at the front desk. The Concierge said they couldn't find it and suggested that it was accidentally given to someone else in another wedding party. Then he offered their gift bag to us! Obviously we declined as that is not exactly the appropriate resolution to the problem. Valet and Concierge services very slow and rather detached. If you enjoy good service with a finer touch you will not find it here. I found the previous reviews describing the service as catering to the 20 - something crowd (meaning they cater to the party/drunk crowds) to be very accurate. Lines were very long at the front desk for people either checking in or asking questions. Lines to get your car were even worse. Attempts to call down to the valet to have the car ready went unanswered several times. Room service was disappointing at best. We called most nights for a late snack and they either never answered the phone or said they would call back and never did. The front desk also called our room several times by mistake sometimes in the early morning or very late at night. The biggest problem at this hotel is the constant pool party. I cannot stress enough to people booking this hotel to book a room that doesn't overlook the pool and bar on the 4th floor. If you want a hotel to relax by the pool then this is not the hotel for you. The few chairs they have are taken first thing in the morning and the place is crawling with people in their 20s and 30s and DRUNK. By the end of the afternoon the pool area was littered with plates of half eaten food, beer bottles, dirty towels and other garbage these people left. The DJ started at noon and went until 11:30 or 12 at night. The music was a constant \"thump thump thump\" of house/techno mixed in with the noise of bar and pool patrons singing at the top of their lungs. Think of it as a nightclub right in the middle of the property. The drunk partygoers would then spill into the lobby every now and then and harass hotel guests. For a hotel that charges almost $250 per night (and $32 for parking per night) I was appalled that they were ok with all this. Several other guests we spoke to in the lobby were also very disappointed and angry. We demanded a room on the other side of the building to get away from the pool. Our new room was a little quieter but I began to realize that we were smack dab in the midst of more partygoers later that night who had rooms near ours. The noise from their rooms drifted down that halls and into our room. We called security about 4 times to complain about the yelling and screaming which finally ceased around 1am. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't sit well with the younger crowd, partygoers and noise because that is what this hotel is all about.

We had asked the valet to leave our car out of the way while we checked to see if we could check-in. When we went to get our car, it was gone (put in the garage), and we had no claim ticket, so we had to wait until the guy that we left the keys with returned. The valet area is small so I understood. We booked through Priceline, so we unsure what kind of room we would receive. We were given a standard room on the 5th floor with a king bed and a standard tub. The room was very similar to the pictures that we saw online, except for the decorative (polka dot) mini-comforter. We called the front desk to ask for the comforter, thinner pillows, a fan, and to fix the TV (awful picture on all channels). Within 2 minutes a technician was there for the TV. We left the room to check out the pool area. When we returned in a few minutes everything we asked for was taken care of. This was the theme throughout our stay. The only speed bump was on one day after a very late night we slept in until 1, and left our room at 2. I saw the maid 2 doors down so I assumed that we would be ok. We got back at 2am to find that our room was not cleaned. I called the front desk and I got the condescending/indifferent person. The maid was at my room in 2 minutes to clean the room, but I just asked for towels, as we were very tired and still needed to shower. The maid was very pleasant and offered to clean the room. I declined as I heard her radio say that she was needed to clean another room. The area around the hotel is an active entertainment area. There is activity everywhere and lots of people.

There was a situation where I dropped my wife off at the hotel and went to park. She called me and said that some drunk was hassling her in the lobby. I raced back ready to confront the drunk and was immediately approached by security and asked for my room key. I presented it and explained why I was hyped. He explained that they had dealt with the several disruptive individuals and apologized. He asked if there was anything that they could do to compensate us for our trouble. We declined.

In terms of location and aesthetics, this hotel was up to par with the other Kimpton hotels. It's very trendy, modern and bright. The decor is fabulous and the room itself was spacious and beautiful. It's centrally located so we were able to walk everywhere. We had some maintenance issues with the lighting and they were quick to resolve them. The maintenance staff was so friendly and made up for the rude front desk staff. Too bad we didn't get the actual room we initially reserved (smoking room but we complained so they switched us to the non-smoking room, no jacuzzi tub, located near the pool area). Despite its appearance, there were too many cons to this hotel: 1) RUDE front desk staff. From the onset, they gave us huge attitude as if they were only used to dealing with celebs and we were a waste of time. Even when correcting their errors, they acted as if they were doing us a favor. Perhaps they were overwhelmed because it was a holiday weekend, but for a hotel of this magnitude I would assume they'd be used to the large number of guests. 2) We didn't get the room we reserved: smoking instead of non-smoking, no jacuzzi tub, overlooking the pool. There was no apology, just attitude. 3) NOISE. Oh my goodness. I enjoy a good party, music and a few beers just like everyone else. But I thought I was witnessing a taping of MTV Spring Break. The music started in the early afternoon and continued throughout the night. We left the hotel on purpose and walked around just to avoid the annoying house music. The pool area is full of scenesters and people looking to hook up so you can't relax. We didn't even mind the noise in the hallway because the noise from the pool overpowered it. 4) They brag about free tea and coffee in the morning, but they ran out of lids for coffee cups. When asked if they were going to get more, they stated flatly they ran out. Huh? I would never stay here again.

The rate was $139/night...and I was initially a bit apprehensive about this being the hotel revealed. It looked very adult-oriented and the reviews have tended to reflect this opinion...and we had two families with one pre-schooler apiece. There wasn't even a mention of cribs being available on the website---although a lot of cool services available for dogs were highlighted. I wrote the property via their website to inquire about the cribs. I quickly received a voice mail message from a very nice man who assured me that they had cribs and to call if I had any questions or further requests. And thus began an amazing experience with the Hotel Solamar's customer service from every single employee we dealt with---from the front desk check-in to the cleaning people we saw in the hall. Everyone seems genuinely delighted to see you and eager to offer recommendations on how to make your stay in the hotel and the area more enjoyable. And bear in mind our party had two almost 3-year old boys in tow (enough to make most people head for the hills). Parents will appreciate how one host named Gordie got down to my son's level, really listened and had a nice conversation with him, and then greeted him by name whenever he saw him. Each child was also presented with a little goody bag of toys, including a thoughtful pre-soaped, duck-shaped sponge that made bathtime a real treat. When the crib was delivered, it was already assembled and was made up with sheets---this in itself is rather unusual! The rooms are a little small, but very well decorated in a hip, modern style. Even the bathrobes are funky----zebra and leopard skin patterned terry cloth! Hilarious! Our bellman who delivered our luggage also kindly pointed out that the honor bar doesn't have those annoying sensors that charge your room if any of the fridge contents get moved---so if you can refrigerate a few small items of your own. The one slight service gaffe was that there was no honor bar key in our room, and it took about half an hour for them to locate an extra one. It seems that most people who get rooms via a discount website get placed on the 4th floor which is the same floor as their pool and poolside bar. The front desk lady was proactive in giving us our rooms facing away from the pool to limit our exposure to DJ noise (seeing as we had young kids), but there was some hallway rowdiness from partygoers entering/leaving the pool area. Nothing terrible though, and the pool closes at 9. The hotel's restaurant JSix is gorgeously appointed, and serves delicious breakfast for a surprisingly reasonable price! Try the Chilaquiles which are amazing! Again, the wait staff were extremely gracious and accommodating to young children. A couple blocks away, the excellent restaurant Basics serves just pizza and salad---but oh, what pizza and salad! The other family vacationing with us originally hail from New York, and they proclaimed it the best pizza they've had on the West Coast. Another great recommendation from the front desk! The location is excellent, only a a few miles away from the San Diego zoo---and a far, far better choice than staying at one of the places on Hotel Circle (especially if you can get a Priceline or Hotwire deal).

We received the New York Times every morning, and any requests we made were promptly and courteously addressed. Dogs are welcomed at the hotel, but they were never a problem or too numerous. (There were none that I saw during the week, with ony three during the weekend.)

We were in need of a nice getaway following Thanksgiving. When finding the Hotel Solomar and checking out the website it seemed cool enough with this kind of peaceful, serenity vibe. Even had yoga chick looking ultra relaxed. The picture showed a nice d\u00e9cor, a bit trendy and then I saw a special for \u201cRomantic Rendezvous\u201d. Perfect! The special was to include cold champagne waiting our arrival, chocolate truffles on our bed, and bed and breakfast.yummy! Sounds pretty romantic eh? Oh but NO. Once we got there, the bubbly but unhelpful reservation woman informed us that we did not have the \u201cRomantic Rendezvous\u201d special and instead had some other promotion. Huh? We don\u2019t want another special. I paid for romance so I expect romance dammit! Soon the manager (I guess) sensing a little trouble tried to help saying he would \u201clook into it and let us know if the morning\u201d. Let us know in the morning? That too late! We want our breakfast in bed so this needed to be taken care of right now. Later we got a call that because of the confusion (in which there was no \u201cconfusion\u201d), they would credit us $50 for room service (More on this in a second). But what about our champagne? What about our truffles? At least a Snickers bar or something! A bit about the hotel: Actually, in all fairness, it\u2019s not that bad. The location is nice in that it is walking distance to the popular Gas lamp district with lots of shopping and restaurants. The d\u00e9cor was pretty funky, no complaints. The room was nice although small. We were warned about all the noise we would receive since the bar and pool is in the center of the hotel. Hopefully, it was just a bad week for them on this Friday and Saturday night, because there may have been seven people max (2 were bartenders\u2026and 1 bar back). So, huh, noise was not an issue. Probably our favorite part was their complimentary wine hour where the guests can mingle in a pretty cool lounge/sitting area and if nothing else, look cool. More importantly, we found this a time to cash in on our missing romantic package, so we helped ourselves to refills oh about every 10 minutes, \u201cborrowed\u201d the wine glasses (they\u2019re in our cupboard right now) and proceeded to purposely get very buzzed and well, romantic! In passing the front desk, another cheery unhelpful reservation girl asked if there was anything she could do for me. Well yes\u2026give us some champagne! I explained once again how they screwed us out of our romantic package and quite possibly jeopardized our chances of an everlasting marriage. I should sue! She said she would send up a bottle of Champagne. Ok, now we\u2019re getting somewhere. Not even 5 minutes later, they call the room saying they out of champagne. $&*&^! \u2013 WTF, how can a hotel be fresh out of champagne. Especially an EMPTY hotel?? Instead we got another bottle of the wine we had already abused earlier. Great. So that evening get ready for our ghetto breakfast in bed with our $50 credit for room service breakfast due to \u201cconfusion\u201d. So we decide on eggs some bacon, toast, a bagel, lox and cheese. With delivery charge, tax, and gratuity\u2026.$47!!! Double WTF? Another nice thing was that the Hotel Solomar was pet friendly, so we brought our cute little dog, Pepper along. Even he was unhappy as he got attacked by two stray pit bulls in the Gas lamp District. So, considering everything, upon checking out we let him poop on the front lawn (and didn\u2019t pick it up\u2026J/K wink) \u2013 Still, this is about how we felt about their \u201cRomantic Rendezvous\u201d\u2026it was crap. The Hotel Solomar is actually a decent place to stay. I think the main problem is marketing it as something it is not. No, you will not have romance there (although the free wine hour helps). You will not find a happening bar filled with drunken chicks. You will not find a real yoga retreat. You will not find a spacious room. You will get an average to slightly above average place to rest your head with a touch of style.

The good news first....If you like modern boutique hotels, you will be impressed by the decor in both the lobby and the hotel room.

I had requested a room on a high floor facing away from the pool as I had read on here that facing the pool basically means you will get no sleep at any hour of the day. I had called to confirm again the day before that I could get a room facing away on the top floor, but wound up with a room on the top floor facing the pool.

(5) Free wireless is always nice. The bad: (1) The hotel rooms are depreciating fast. This was out second visit and within a year the bedroom furniture looks very different. Our white chair was covered in coffee stains and the walls are in need of repair. (2) Avoid the Virtuoso Suites. Our previous standard room was almost as big. The suite we booked this time was dark, the bedroom was tiny and the living room had no natural daylight. The oversized bathtub was nice but other than that nothing very exciting about he room. (3) The pool is a disaster \u2013 seating for around 10 people in a relatively large hotel is crazy. It also seems that the pool users are mostly non-guests at the weekend. Locals come to the bar, change in the toilets and use the pool. The pool has a DJ playing very loud music on the weekends. We are in our late 20\u2019s, so don\u2019t get us wrong. But on a Saturday at 12 noon you don\u2019t want music so loud that you can\u2019t talk to the person next to you as you relax by the pool (if you could get a seat that is). (4) Room service. Room service is provided by the onsite (but we were told separately managed) restaurant. We never got what we ordered and when we complained were told \u2018too bad.\u2019 One morning they did not have orange juice and decided to send apple juice instead. I declined but was charged anyway! This was just one of a few problems with room service so our advise is to go out for food. (5) Bar. I think this hotel was built as an excuse to have a bar. The bar tends to dominate the hotel and tends to focus on non-hotel guests. We asked if it might be possible to get a table and it was, but only for $250. For San Diego this is a little too much even for the public but you would think that a hotel guest could get a seat without this cost. The worst thing about the bar is the attitude of the bouncers who won\u2019t let hotel guests back to their room to use the toilet. The queue at the bar tends to be long and my wife wanted to go to her room but the bouncer on the hotel exit/entrance told her that if she left she would not be readmitted. This despite the fact that the hotel is directly connected to the bar and this door is used only by hotel guests. So overall, we would save money next time and stay in the Omni down the street. From a prior visit we known that the Omni pool is bigger and far superior, the rooms are nicer and the views are better. We returned to the Solamar because it is smaller and more intimate.

And just last month my wife and I picked the Cypress Hotel in Cupertino, California when we went to see our daugher graduate from Santa Clara. I love the unique things Kimpton does with their boutiquey hotels (most have about 200 rooms) and so signed up for their loyalty program in Cupertino. That being said there are some shortcomings at Hotel Solamar as there probably are with all hotel facilities. Yes, the sink was too shallow (but very artsy-fartsy). Yes, the lighting in the bathroom was too \"moody,\" (dark in the shower, hard to shave in the poorly lit mirror, no fan to extract the moisture from a hot shower). And yes, the music out of our tenth floor window looking down on \"the 20-something scene\" below thumped all night. We came prepared, however. We were in San Diego with two other couples to attend the Padres baseball game. The other two couples were staying at the adjacent Marriott and were paying more ($259.00 as versus our $229.00) for less service. We grabbed our moment to have a drink at the Hotel Solamar bar by meeting the other two couples there for pre-game drinks, before the hip crowd arrived. We always travel with ear plugs so the noise wasn't an issue later on. We are accustomed to the expensive parking fees in that area. But we love the high thread count sheets with the exquisite decorating that Kimpton's do. We like the personal attention their staff gives and their promptness in rendering service. When we needed our car to get called up to go golfing, it was there when we got downstairs. When we called our friends to see where they were, they were still waiting for someone to bring their car around. Everyone from the reception folks to the bell men were anxious to please and engaged in dialogue. I did check around before booking my hotel for this baseball game. We wanted to be within walking distance of Petco Park and the Gaslamp district. The Omni (where we have stayed twice) was quoting $299.00 for this weekend unless you had purchased their baseball special (which had no availability when I checked). The Gaslamp Marriott was at $259.00, the Convention Center Marriott was at $289.00 and originally Hotel Solamar was at $319.00. But with Triple A (or AARP) the rate declined to $239.00 and the loyalty program took another $10.00 a night off. Cheaper price for a more hip environment with better service???...no brainer.

Previously while in San Diego, we have stayed at both the Omni and the Marriott downtown. Available downtown hotel rooms were limited on the night we needed, so I booked first and read tripadvisor afterward. That's the reverse of my usual procedure. I was more than concerned by the alleged flea issues, and I suppose arrived expecting some kind of disguised claptrap. Also, because we are middle aged, I thought we might feel out of place in a world of trendy twentysomethings. Was I in for a surprise! Yes, the hotel is pet friendly, as almost ALL European hotels are, even the most fashionable. (Remember, Oprah won't travel without her dogs and if a place is good enough for Oprah, it's good enough for me.) I only saw one pet; a small poodle type, adoringly held by it's owner and swaddled in pink accessories. Hotel Solamar was immaculate. From the strikingly designed lobby area to the designer-inspired rooms, the place exuded sophisticated ambience. The staff was friendly, helpful, and professional at all times and went out of the way to make our stay exceptionally enjoyable. The location is perfect: just steps away from the wonderful restaurants in Gaslamp, and a 2 block walk to Petco Park. Since my husband is a huge baseball fan, I planned a surprise B-Day celebration, and therefore had some special needs. Initially, I asked for a room with a view of the baseball park, and even though we made our reservations through Hotwire, Chip went out of his way to accomodate us. I also had to engage the services of the concierge, Christian. The cake ordered from Extraordinary Desserts (beyond belief!) and 2 special-recipe blended drinks we invented in Cayman were waiting for us in our room following the Padres game. I think every single staff member we encountered wished my husband a Happy B-Day and went way beyond expectations to be sure we had a positive experience. I actually had to force a small gratuity into Christian's hand, as nobody wanted to accept a tip for what I thought was amazing service! They all just said the reward for them was the great fun they had participating in such a surprise! There's a nightly free wine tasting---as many glasses as you like.

This is a Kimpton Hotel by the way, so if you love their style, this is another great example of it. Ultra-chic and very stylish. Lobby is beautiful and there's a fun little sitting area with a big fireplace. Our room was overlooking the pool and bar. The bed was very comfortable and they also upgraded us to an \"extended tub\"...it was an extra-long jacuzzi tub. Interesting, I'm not sure what the benefit of extra-long was because it didn't fit 2 any better than a regular bathtub, oh well. :) They do have FUN animal print bathrobes...I so wanted to take one but they were custom for the hotel and I'm sure it would have cost about $200! We went down to the pool bar area and again, very swanky with long couches and big bowl firepits all over. Partial view of the city, very cool. One weird thing was that they wouldn't let us smoke over by the firepits (against the edge of the building) but we could smoke at the bar, where all the other people were sitting.

Worth noting however that if its not busy (as with the Sunday of our stay) they dont hang around. Around ten mins to go and they had took all the wine and no one was around to get anymore.

We stayed over Labor Day Weekend and I have to agree with most of the other recent reviewers. First the good: location, location, location. It's an easy walk to the many restaurants of the Gaslamp District, an easy walk to Petco Park and an easy walk to Seaport Village. Our 9th floor corner room was said to have a 'lot more room than our normal rooms.\" I'd hate to see the normal rooms, then. There was literally no space to put clothes. One small drawer on one side of the bedside, and a mini-drawer under the mini-bar. Even smaller was the bathroom. There was no place to hang a hand-towel. We couldn't find room for our own toilet items. And the sink had good form, but no function. The biggest disappointment was the hotel staff. Pleasant but it felt like they were in WAY over their heads. We asked for directions to two nearby restaurants and they had no clue. There was no concierge to ask, since the hotel doesn't have one. When we asked for information on nearby tourist sites, once again they had none. So, I finally asked the front desk if I could see a phone book to look up a number and was told, \"Sorry, we don't have one.\" There was a Padres game Sunday afternoon, and since it was a holiday weekend, the pool area was packed starting around 3:00 with people who wanted to drink to get drunk. There was no way to use the pool, which shouldn't seem like a lot to ask for rooms going over $350/night. Finally, try to find out how recently a dog stayed in your room.

I enjoyed the atmosphere at the hotel and the staff was very courteous. Our room was cleaned early in the day and it felt very clean. We had wanted two beds, but only a King was left, but we were upgraded to a corner room which was very large. Our room overlooked the pool/club area. It was a nice view. The bathroom was very nicely appointed with quality features, but the lighting was very soft. It was nice and calm in the morning until time to take a close look in the mirror and apply makeup and the it was just too dark in there. I was surprised there wasn't better lighting or a better fan. The wallpaper was ubsosrbing all the moisture, which might lead to problems later with mold. We were greeted professionally by the desk upon our arrival. We were offered a roll away, but ended up being fine sharing a bed with my daughter. The bed was VERY comfortable. We had no trouble with the parking, (valet only $24 a day) we were always noticed by the tag in our window and given priority parking and service as hotel guests. On the weekend the club seems to be one of the hottests places to be. THe lobby was filled with security people and the elevators. THere were people posing a guests of the hotel trying to get into the club sneaking around the hotel. It was uncomfortable to be a hotel guest with all these other people lurking around. We went to our room and the minibar hadn't been restocked, my daughter wasn't feeling well and wanted a sprite. We went to go find one from a soft drink machine. We couldn't find a machine, so we made our way down stairs. Maybe there was one on the floor of the pool/gym but the area was full of people all dressed up and so we didn't feel comfortable getting off there in our \"loungewear\" to look. We asked a few people where we could get a soft drink, but they told us they were all security. We finally went to the frontdesk and were told they would send us up one in 5 minutes, but it never came up. This hotels seems to be two different places, a nice hotel of qualilty service during the day, but the weekend nights seem to be all about the club, and servicing it. THe hotel guests are not the main focus of service, or at least that was our experience. I had been moving my daughter in all day, and was looking forward to a quite soak and swim, which is a usual relaxing experienceat a hotel, but we came back to 200 people surround the pool, which became part of the decor and atmosphere of the club, not something accessible to hotel guests. It seems to me they need to decide what they want to be or offer another area for hotel guests to enjoy. For the price, for a hotel guest to be made to feel like an outsider and second for service was shocking. It is a nice place, just know what to expect and a quiet weekend of being pampered won't be it. Also, I noticed men taking \"women\" up to their rooms from the club, which seemed a bit awkward and like a skanky Vegas hotel instead of a nice clean upscale hotel. It was a strange mix, but over all during the week I would say it is one of the best hotels in SD.

At the front desk, I waited about three minutes for someone to show. When they finally did, they didn't apologize for the wait nor welcome me to the hotel. The second day, I was supposed to receive a UPS Package. UPS records showed it was delivered, the hotel showed they received it, but the package was \"misplaced\". It was an important package I needed for a tradeshow the next day. Although the package was never found, the hotel manager did send one of his employees out to purchase a similar item for replacement. One morning, my co-workers and I sat down for breakfast. We were given coffee with our menus. It took about 20 minutes for the waiter to return. When he served our order it was wrong. He was very apologetic and comped the meal, mentioning they were short staffed that morning. It seems as if the hotel staff can make up for their shortgivings, however if you are paying $300+ a night, you shouldn't have to endure a negative experience. I've been very pleased with the Kimpton brand (Hotel Monaco in Denver and Washington, D.C.)so I expected the same level of service at this property. In their defense, it is a fairly new property. However, the hotel business isn't new. If a guest pulls up in a cab, don't walk inside. If a guest is standing at the counter for a few minutes, apologize and welcome them to the hotel. If a guest has a package sent to the hotel, don't lose it. It seems like they need to pay attention to the small details in order to make this a property worth coming back to. Since it's right in the Gaslamp District, there are many others to chose from. I doubt I would stay here again. They had an Omni attached to the ball park, so I may give that a try next time I'm in SD.", "Date": "March 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cA Place to Stay but don't Overpay\u201d", "Author": "cineart", "ReviewID": "UR4368541", "Content": "I don't know what's up with San Diego but it seems that all the hotels in the gaslamp area are charging New York prices. The convention center is very busy with New Orleans convention overflow and any decent place within walking distance of gaslamp is charging about $300/night plus $22 parking. I decided to play Russian roulette with Hotwire and bid a four star gaslamp area hotel for $204/night +taxes (for a Thursday and Friday night stay) I got the Solamar, a new boutique hotel that bills itself as four stars. I\u2019ve read the other reviews here and thought I\u2019d add some comments. The staff was all top notch and I encountered no rude or sub par service as mentioned before. The lobby is well appointed and a nice place to relax and the 4th floor bar is also a nice hangout. The workout room is a joke- the smallest I\u2019ve ever seen with about four pieces of equipment. The pool is also a ridiculous 3\u2019 deep and therefore useless. The hotel is new so the rooms and furnishings are clean. But here is the real point of my review \u2013value. Our room was very, very small \u2013so small that it didn\u2019t have the requisite \u2018two chairs and a table by the window set-up\u2019 in case you wanted to invite a guest up to your room. More importantly, the rooms were poorly insulated. Any seasoned traveler knows the awful sound of heavy fireproof hotel doors slamming early in the morning as Business Bob leaves at 6:30AM for a meeting. We could hear next-door conversations and the maid vacuuming at 8:00AM very clearly. All of this does not fit in my definition of a four star hotel. Yes the room was decorated in a funky hip style. But with the room size and noise it felt like the Solamar built regular, small and acoustically sub par rooms and then hired a decorator to do an \u2018extreme makeover\u2019 adding drapes, some funky lamps and art. That just doesn\u2019t cut it for their regular $300/night rates. At $204 I felt neither screwed nor did I feel I got any value. If I paid just $5 more a night I might have been pissed. The lobby and bar may look four star but after all I am paying for a room. I\u2019d stay here again but if I had to pay $300 I\u2019d choose the Marriot Gas lamp (NOT the other Marriot monster convention hotel by the water!!) The Marriot Gas lamp may not have a basin type Kohler sink and funky drapes but the standard rooms are big, immaculate, and have an equally unique California Craftsman style about it.
