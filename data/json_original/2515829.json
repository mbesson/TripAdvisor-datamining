Harrah's has economical/Green heating/cooling. When there is no movement in the room the system shuts off....it does not remain at a constant temp --- it just shuts off. So, for the 3 nights we were there for a conference my husband and I would take turns getting up out of bed, walk to the end of the bed so the sensor would kick on the a/c. Needless to say, we did not rest well while at the hotel. On 3 different occasions we had questions that we wanted to ask at the Information desk, however, there was NEVER anyone at the desk. Finally, there was not a line and I decided to ask one of the the people at registration. When I walked up I was met with \"Information only and only 1 question.\" Never did we feel welcome. We definitely will NEVER stay here again and would NOT recommend it unless you enjoy waiting in line and losing a few pounds by sweating throughout the night.

The room was spacious and clean. The buffet was decent, if a bit overpriced. Parking was easy and free of cost. My preference when in Las Vegas is location, and this hotel fit that bill nicely. I could have easily stayed in a lower-tier hotel and been just as happy, though. Plus I would have only spent about thirty percent of what I paid here.

Upon check out, we forgot to get our money, passports and plane tickets from our room safe, luckily when we retrieved it after 3 hours, it was still there. valet parking is very convenient and reasonable, they dont charge you parking fees. The only drawback in staying at this hotel is the lack of wifi, we had to go to the nearby mcdonalds for a free wifi which was very slow. this is just a minor inconvenience, we would definitely go back to this hotel on our future trips. take advantage of the low rates before they get smarter. hahaha", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cSix days wells spent at Harrah's Las Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "Goodwin0904", "ReviewID": "UR128524839", "Content": "My husband and I spent 6 nights at Harrah's Las Vegas, 4/15/2012 to 4/21/2012. We got in rather early on a Sunday- around 11am and attempted to check-in however the room was not ready. With much ease we checked our bags in and hit The Strip for some sightseeing. We called around 3pm and VIOLA! The room was ready. We stayed in room 1043 of the Mardi Grad Tower. It was a corner room with a sofa which is larger than the non-corner rooms. The room had a small balcony which overlooked the pool and Carnival Court. After reading some of the other reviews I was worried about the late-night noise but this was never an issue as long as the balcony door was completely shut. We found the room to be comfortable and accomodating. The bed was nice and plush. The TV was an updated flat-screen. We never once turned on the flat-screen in the bathroom, but we did use the coffee maker. (NOTE: If you are a coffee drinker hustle on down to Walgreens at the Venetian and score yourself some of your favorite roast because the coffee that comes in the room is NAST!) The drain in the bathtub was exceptionally slow - but, no huge problem. Afterall, the room was comped for 6 nights so I wasn't going to complain too loudly! We had an early dinner at Flavors Buffet (see separate review) which was lack-luster. But, that may have been because we went right at the end of lunch before the dinner items were put out. We also dined at KGBs and The Oyster Bar. (See separate reviews). We found the staff to be extremely helpful throughout our stay. The casino is dated and much smaller than most other Strip casinos, but if you are looking for a superb location with reasonable rates and comfy beds then this is the place for you! There is a walkway which connects Harrah's to Imperial Palace. There is also a monorail station right out back which is SUPER HANDY! Oh! Some folks complained about the cigarette smoke in the hotel. My thought is this: IT'S VEGAS! IT'S SMOKE! BIG DEAL! The smoke was not bad at all in any other area than the casino. I was more bothered by people who bring small children into the casino.

It topped 98 when we were there & the rooms took a while to cool down if we were gone very long thanks to their \"green\" iniative of having the air co shut down after you leave your room. It also turned it off at night so we would get up once or twice to keep it cool at night. The breakfast buffet was excellent & a good bargain & Toby Keith's Bar & Grill was fun with great food.

The room was in the Marti Gras tower and was super clean and very updated, rich wood and marble, balcony that opened and as requested not next to the ice machine, however it was on the back side of the elevators (M624) and trying to sleep was hard w/o some advil PM. The best way to describe the sound was a bowling alley and the ball bing thrown down the wooden alley and never hitting any pins, constantly! Was close to requesting a different room and should have but stuck it out. The AC was a pain in the rear. Get back to the room and it's 80 degrees, the AC only works when there is motion in the room, so after 4-5 minutes on laying in bed the AC turns off, still 80 degrees! You have to wave your arms, the AC turns on. Slept the 1st night with the sliding door open and the outside breeze blowing in (bringht lights too). Next day went to Target on Flamingo just off the strip and bought a fan, that helped but only to move air, the AC only runs with motion and once you lay down it turns off till you wave your arms. Stayed from Apr 10-14 for $30 a night, book direct with your players club and shop for promo codes, another bonus with Harrah's is NO RESORT FEES! Now that's a true $30 a night rate. Do you really know what a Resort Fee is? Researh that bogus 'stick it to the tourist' fee and you'll never stay at a propert that charges a resort fee again! Took the fan back to Target in the original box and receipt for a refund on travel day, we'll stay at Harrah's again, just not next to an ice machine OR elevator. check in was prompt and friendly and the housekeeping staff was excellent. Room was always clean, only down side is the king size bed was kinda old, had the 'speed bump' in the middle and I felt like I was going to roll off the side. Bit of a challenge when spending 'adult time' with your Fiance'. Bottom line, very good value, very clean and modern. Middle of the strip so walking is not as bad. Bad would be getting in the parking garage, construction makes it a little hard but that will be fixed soon, grafitti as you exit the parking garage and walking to the lobby needs to be cleaned up.

They then informed us that 1. The Executive Suites are on their own floor, and 2. that it would require a $100 per night deposit. Neither had been disclosed when we booked. We asked if our friends could at least be in the same building, or upgraded, annoyed she said the best she could do is get them in the same building. The Classic Executive Suite on the 32nd floor was NOT worth it. It was very outdated, with uncomfortable furniture. This is our 6th time in a hotel suite in Las Vegas, and this room was by far the worst. The mattress sagged in the middle, as did the sofa. The pillows were way too soft. One night we decided to eat in, and noticed that the dinner table was unbalanced, and wobbled to the point of being unusable. Even all the way up on the 32nd Floor you can still hear the music blasting from Carnival Court till 4:30am. You can also hear it in the hallway, so soundproofing is non-existent. The Classic Room they gave our friends, was a dark double room. The A/C did not work, and they acknowledged that they were unable to fix it.

Therefore, I let a lot of things slide that I usually don't when picking a hotel. Harrah's is in prime location. Its midstrip and close to many great hotels like Caesar's Palace, Venetian, Treasure Island and the Mirage. In addition, the Monorail has a stop outside of the hotel, therefore you are a quick train trip away from hotels on either side of the Strip. Arrived on Thursday a little before 11AM. Though check-in isn't until 4PM the line was ridiculously long. It took about 30 minutes to check -in and our room still wasn't ready. However we were told to check the information desk at noon for the status, and if another room was ready they would give us that. We ended up going to IcePan on the 2nd floor (a great place where they make the ice cream right in front of you), and by the time we got back our room still wasn't ready however another one was so whe checked in. We were given a Premium room in the Mardi Gras tower on the 10th floor, which faced Carnival Court. If you are a light sleeper then the location of this room will not be ideal because music is being played until the wee hours of the morning. However, it didn't bother me that much once I was actually asleep. The room itself was a bit on the small side and it had some cosmetic flaws. For example one of the electric sockets was almost pulled out of the wall. The bed itself was comfortable (pillow-top I think). The room also has a motion activated AC Unit. Therefore, when coming back to the room after a long time of being away, it usually is bit warm. Also at night when sleeping, it shuts off because their is no movement. I found myself waving my arms numerous times in the middle of the night to get it to turn back on. The walls are very thin. I could hear the next rooms conversation easily. In addition the room had flat screen tvs in the bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom was also on the small side. The lights were over the sink which left the tub/shower combo a bit dark. However, the water pressure was great, and I had nice hot showers everyday. I was concerned about the doorknob of the bathroom door. If you closed it completely it seemed that it took a lot of work to twist the knob to open it back up. Their were many times when I thought I was actually 'stuck' in there. The room does have a safe which I utilized for my tablet (I read other reviews regarding people's stuff being stolen). The casino itself was medium sized, it took a couple of trips before I was able to walk around not get lost. The slots didn't seem that loose and they didn't have a lot to choose from i.e. I saw a lot of Penny and dollar machines but no nickel machines. We ate breakfast at the Flavors buffet. Their was a good selection and line wasn't long. However, make sure you have a Total Rewards Card you get a couple dollars off the price. That was the only meal we ate there, because we ventured out to other hotels. One great thing is that the hotel offers a shuttle for $7 to the airport, no stops in between. In addition, you can also use some of your comps to pay for it. All in all it was an okay hotel. However, I found myself longing for the Bellagio.

The day we left there were many folks at the checkin counter so its just hit and miss. We booked the room thru a vacation site. At the counter upon check in I asked if there was a room available that had a view of the mirage's volcano and was told we could either have a king bed or the view. i didnt ask for any upgrades so i am not sure what we could have done - we got a room with a king bed, but a bad view. The bed was nice and comfortable, the shower and bathroom area was fine, nothing fancy (didnt expect it to be). The a/c was a bit loud when you first entered the room, its because they auto shut off the air when you leave the room. so when you first get there it blasts the air to get back to your temp. You just had to put up with it for about 10-15 mins before it became not so loud. As far as the room goes, the most out of date item was the tv. I'm sure the tv was pretty sweet, back in 1990. Considering how cheap lcd's are, to put small ones in the room would not cost very much. Of course, they dont want you watching tv in your room in Vegas. The casino part of the hotel was fine - they had acceptable limits on tables for the quality of hotel. Any of the dealers I encountered were polite. The sports book was ok, its not Caesar's but it gets the job done. I had read reviews of how bad the smoke was. My wife is allergic to smoke, and we didnt think it was too bad. We ate at Toby Keith's restaurant a couple times and enjoyed our time there. My wife is a big fan of his and I like a few songs. What makes Harrah's nice is the location. It is simply perfect. Quick walk to Caesars, Mirage, Venetian, Flamingo. You can stay at harrah's and avoid the big prices of staying at caesars or venetian. The monorail comes into the back of Harrah's, just a short walk. We used it to go down to MGM. We are Margaritaville fans and I was there every day for awhile - it is a great place to eat, drink, and gamble. Just nice from harrah's, its a very short walk there. If you are looking for a good, average hotel with a great location Harrah's will do the job.

I had read reviews on trip advisor, so our room was at least quiet. It was up high and on the other side from the incredibly loud outdoor party area in front. Most frustrating was that it was impossible to adjust the temperature in our room in any meaningful way. The thermostat seemed to ignore whatever setting you gave and just blew out air endlessly at whatever fixed temperature it had. Our room was too hot initially, so we had them come up and adjust the system. At that point it blew out cold air and got the room very cold by morning. I called them back the next evening, and they said I had a choice of too hot or too cold, with the air coming out either way at a fixed temperature. He suggested too cold, because you could always just shut it off manually , which I did in the middle of the night. Still, is it too much to want a heating cooling system you can set to a particular temperature, rather than one that blows out air constantly at either too high or too low a temperature? That doesn't seem too much to ask for a hotel in this price range.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anchorage, Alaska", "Title": "\u201cSolid standby choice\u201d", "Author": "jaumeAlaska", "ReviewID": "UR126652593", "Content": "Compared to the newer properties on the strip, Harrahs is a bit dated.

Having never stayed there we thought it worth a try. We have been on other occasions to the Luxor, and the Paris, both of which were terrific. Harrah\u2019s not so terrific. Things are tough all over, especially in Vegas it seems. The conference rate was $119, which when we booked seemed acceptable. Had to arrive one night earlier though, when the conference contract rate was unavailable. The rack rate for the extra night was $39.00. Rates on hotels are a crapshoot it seems, so be sure to look round carefully. Before heading off to Vegas I got an email from Harrah\u2019s offering me an \u2018upgrade\u2019 to a \u2018Luxury\u2019 room for $15. Not knowing what that was I called them. At first they said it was a luxury room. But what does that mean I asked. Well, it\u2019s on a higher floor with a view of the Strip. And is it bigger? No. More luxurious? No. have a Jacuzzi? No. It\u2019s just not staring at a wall or a parking lot, it has a view. So we went with it and the view was fine. There was a little sign in our room that advised us to consult the \u2018Guest Service Directory\u2019 for telephone charge information. After making many inquiries it finally was revealed that there is no such animal. Somebody at the Information desk tore off a page map for me when I asked, so I could find my way to various places. She finally told me that when the hotel \u2018went green\u2019 the directory was discontinued. What does that mean, I asked, going green? Surely you\u2019ve heard of the problems with the economy, I was informed, not very pleasantly. So green means cutting corners and claiming it is a virtuous thing one has done. Information goes first its seems, so be prepared to ask a lot of questions. The hotel advertises itself as having \u2018no resort fees\u2019 and one needs to know what that euphemism means. We went to the exercise room and were told that indeed there were no resort fees, but there was usage charge of from $10 to $25 per day. I asked at the front desk about this, and was told that some hotels build in a resort charge of up to $40 or $50, even if one does not use the gym etc. This fine establishment does not do that, but charges on a per use basis. Check out Harrah\u2019s rates; they vary from $35 to $250. \u2018No resort fees\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to mean anything. Now, to be fair, the hotel was clean enough, the housekeeping person was fine and the room got made up regularly. The casino is ok if not great go visit the Venetian and Palazzo right next door. The barkeeper in the Palazzo turned off one of the hundred tv\u2019s featuring March madness and found the Penguins/Rangers hockey game for us. Now for that kind of friendly service I\u2019d stay in Vegas\u2014just at some other hotel next time. One with a free gym.

This was my first time in the hotel. Overall, it was a disappointing experience. I checked in around 10:30 PM on a Sunday night after taking a flight from the east coast. There are fourteen stations where you can be checked in, but only four clerks were working. The line was pretty long and contained many students on spring break. Check-in took almost 30 minutes, most of which was time spent waiting in line. The room I booked was not the one I received. I was placed in the Carnival Tower, which was supposed to be the quieter one. The room was offered at a corporate rate of $109 per night. Instead of one king size bed, I got a room with two queen sized beds. The rooms are very dated, soundproofing isn't very good (I could clearly hear conversations in adjacent rooms) and there are some amenities missing. There was no refrigerator in the room, nor was there any kind of hotel directory. If I wanted a room with a refrigerator, I could get an upgrade, for a price, of course. There is no wireless internet access in the hotel room which I had. Quite surprising since even places like La Quinta offer free wireless access. Perhaps it is available in other rooms, but internet access cost around $12 per day (wired connection, CAT-5 cable in room). The bathroom didn't have a ventilation fan. The fixtures are new, but there is no way to get rid of the steam from the shower or other bathroom odors. Access to the health club costs $20 per day if you go before 4:00 PM or is $10 after that. It closes at 7:00 PM so don't plan on a late evening workout. There is smoking allowed in the hotel and casino, and the smell of smoke is everywhere. Even in a non-smoking room, it can still be detected. It's very bad on the casino floor. Windows in the room are not very kid-friendly. The lower portion of the window opens into the room (see photos below) and there is no screen or guard on the outside. When the window is open, the gap isn't large enough for an adult to easily slip through, but a child could fit. Quite a scary thought when you are 23 floors up. If you are bringing small children, look someone else. For the positives, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the staff friendly and the location very good.

The first two nights were fine. The third night (March 14,2012), was horrible. My Macbook got stolen and for sure it was the housekeeper\u2019s fault. On the 3rd day, Wednesday, we left the hotel about 1:30 pm to go eat and start our day. We left the room messy. When we got back to the hotel, at 10 pm, we thought to ourselves that the housekeeper didn\u2019t come in as the pillows were on the floor. But when we looked to the bathroom, there were fresh towels and everything. The beds were obviously made, as there were new comforters (we had a child with us and he spilled chocolate milk all over the comforter). We then thought that maybe the housekeeper didn\u2019t finish doing the beds and then left. We didn\u2019t think too much about the pillows and went ahead and did other stuff. When I was ready to get ready for bed, around 12am, I was getting my clothes from my luggage, and my laptop was gone! My laptop was safely hidden inside my luggage. My laptop was inside a laptop sleeve and that laptop sleeve was inside a blue bag and that blue bag was inside another laptop bag and that laptop bag was inside my luggage. The luggage was even at the very far back with other luggage in front. I cannot believe that someone would actually take something from inside the luggage. It\u2019s not like I had my laptop laying around visibly. We immediately called the front desk to tell them and they sent a security officer to our room. We told him what went down and all he can say was they will investigate and we should call a 1800 number for the results on Tuesday, March 20,2012. It takes them about a week to investigate and they didn\u2019t even do any immediate actions. The security officer even complained that our room was all the way in the 11th floor and that his office was at the basement and it\u2019s inconvenient for him to go up and down. There\u2019s an elevator for god\u2019s sakes. The hotel has no CCTVs. What if something worse were to happen\u2026 then they wouldn\u2019t know because there are no security cameras. For sure that it was the housekeeper\u2019s fault because before leaving we already noticed the doors not being locked well. When you close the door, it would seem that it is already locked but it really isn\u2019t locked unless you pull it harder. Another evidence that it was the housekeeper\u2019s fault is because the beds were somewhat made. And so, they were the last one to enter the room. I seriously despise this hotel and their staff. They weren\u2019t even accommodating to our needs. I already filed a police report stating the incident. Now we still need to wait until Tuesday to hear from the hotel. I uploaded a video of how the door was defective.

We stayed at Harrah's for the first time based on feedback from various TA reviews. With a little effort we were able to get our rooms for about $23 per night including all taxes/fees - allowing us to spend our money on some awesome shows. There are a lot of complaints from other TA reviewers about having to pay extra if you check in early. So, DON'T check in early! We arrived at the hotel before 10am and if we had checked in it would have cost an extra $25. Instead, we simply checked in our bags (free), completed our preliminary paperwork (locking in the best available room early), then we explored part of the strip in 70 degree sunshine, ate lunch, took advantage of a timeshare presentation (separate review) to get ourselves several free show tickets, a $50 visa card, and a free 5-couse Italian dinner (salmon & pasta which was very good). We stayed out until almost midnight THEN we finished checking into the hotel when there were no long check-in lines (another common complaint by other TA reviewers). The room was in the Carnival Tower and when we did our preliminary check-in I specifically requested a refurbished non-smoking room with a king bed on a floor that was NOT pet friendly (based on other TA reviews - great advice). We were on the 17th floor and there were no barking dogs and no obvious smoking odors (unlike almost everywhere else in Vegas). The room was quite large, the bed was reasonably comfortable, we achieved decent sleep when we decided to stop for a rest, the bathroom was large and clean, and the shower head had multiple settings with plenty of water pressure. All in all, especially considering that we paid less than $23 total per night, Harrah's met our needs for this quick trip. The location on the strip was very good - a little south of the Venetian complex which has many interesting things to see, like a very nice simulated Venice setting complete with real canals and gondola boats that you can ride if you choose. The grand entry has very high hand painted ceilings that remind one of Michael Angelo's works in Italy. There are shops galore and numerous restaurants to enjoy, including the Italian (of course) \"outdoor patio\" place named Tintoretto that we enjoyed our free dinner at. One of the free shows (another gift for enduring the timeshare presentation) that we attended was at the Venetian (Blue Man Group). Just to the south of Harrah's is Caesar's Palace then the Belagio - where they put on an awesome lighted dancing water fountain display set to music several times each evening (free). Right across the street from Harrah's is the Mirage where you can watch a simulated volcano erupt (blasts of water lighted to the color of molten magma along with huge natural gas fired flames and fire balls). This too is free to observe from the street or as we did, from the elevated vantage point on the front of the Venetian entryway. My one rather significant complaint about the hotel - which is true for many Las Vegas hotels except for some of the newer places - is the extremely poor ventilation in and around the casino and the hotel lobby. One must walk through the casino every time that you want to head out to the strip for a walk to a show, a meal, or whatever else you want to do.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised!\u201d", "Author": "fozb", "ReviewID": "UR125761629", "Content": "I stayed at Harrah's last week for two nights.

Check-in was a little slow. We arrived on a Wednesday afternoon at 4pm, and there was a long line, with only 3 people working the counter. Took about 45 minutes to check in. This was the only complaint I have about the place. Plenty of elevators that were quick. Parking garage was easy to access and was free. The breakfast buffet was excellent, but a little pricey, I think it was @ $18. The location on the stip can't be beat. You right in the middle of it all, and have a tram stop right there. Overall I rate it very good, and would stay here again. Just make sure you ask for a new;y remodeled room when you check in. I booked the cheapest room online, and asked for a new room at check in and got it at no extra cost.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cheshire", "Title": "\u201cStaying here was weirdly satisfying.\u201d", "Author": "chrismcgmcg", "ReviewID": "UR125403764", "Content": "if you want chaos, it is here not just this hotel but, vegas generally, and they all manage it so well.

Got a fairly good rate on a \"Mini Suite\" so we booked 3 nights Harrah's, then 2 nights at the Golden Nugget. First - The Good: We got in around 11 pm Sunday and got checked in quickly and easily thanks to Meshan at the front desk. We've been to Vegas 15 times and she is CLEARLY the best front desk person ever. If I ran a resort, I would definitely try to steal her away - she's pleasant, efficient friendly and cheerful - an amazing person. Room was nice-sized, updated, and very nice. The bed was comfortable, and the rooms were the quietest we've stayed in, which is a big plus.The Carnival tower is fantastic, as the casino is pretty decent and the location is STELLAR! If you want to be on the Strip, you can't beat it. The rooms are not as plush as Caesar's, but they're larger AND you can get out and hit the casino or be on the strip in a couple of minutes. My other big plus for them is their valets are lightning fast. We went to no less than 10 casinos and none were nearly as quick and friendly as Harrah's. THE BAD! We got into room and it was 80 degrees - called the desk and were told it's motion activated cooling. If no one is in room, no air flow. Drank and gambled until 2 am, etc.. next moring 78 degrees. We moved to a smoking room the next evening (again, thank you Meshan) to find it at 80 degrees. We were assured it would cool down (uh huh, sure). Next morning 78 degrees. Called again - desk said she'd send someone while we were out. (NO idea if anyone tried.) Got in at 2am ... yup 78 degrees. Called desk, were told they \"took care of it\" and it would cool down. I hung up. Woke up to ... 78 degrees. Called again, they said it would be taken care of. Left for the day, got in at 2am again, 79 degrees. Wife called and BEGGED (as I laughed in the background) and to my surprise a maintenance man got there in FIVE minutes and fixed it!!!! I didn't get his his name but he was great. The temp was below 70 in about 10 minutes. Of course, we had to check out 9 hours later so I can't give a great review. If you want to stay on the strip, Harrahs or Flamingo are really the best \"nice\" option for the price, provided you get an updated room. (The older rooms are NOT great.) But frankly, our stay at the Golden Nugget was wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy better and we may stay on Fremont street instead on the nest trip, as the Strip casinos are just getting too pricey and their gambling odds are now too much in favor of the house.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Cloud, Minnesota, United States", "Title": "\u201cOverall Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "Laura F", "ReviewID": "UR124451943", "Content": "My fiance and I stayed at Harrah's in Las Vegas for 4 days.

She told us that while pets are allowed on that floor, if they bark or are disruptive, then that isn't allowed. Not sure on how they police this. I mean, what did they do to the people with the barking dogs? The suite had a fax machine, a roll out couch, king size bed and a tv in the bathroom.

We were very happy to learn that this would be $9 a day each which was enough for a large coffee and danish every day! The only reason I wouldn't give Harrah's 5* is because one of my biggest bug bears in Vegas is paper thin walls and Harrah's had thin walls. Luckily our neighbours weren't too loud but still I don't want to hear other peoples conversations - that being said it wasn't too bad.

The cable is for some reason located next to the bed, so I had to carry a small table from the other side of the room so I'd have somewhere to work. The TV was an old box, and the bed below average. I received a few packages while staying there, and was surprised to be charged $5-7 per package in hotel handling fees. The breakfast buffet at Flavors was disappointing. There are virtually no healthy options, but great if you love grease. However, I enjoyed a burger at KGB and the service was good. This hotel seems to be cater to middle-aged Americans from rural America that enjoy playing slots while smoking from early morning, love wearing sneakers with any outfit, and that consider the rulator the best invention ever.

If you are looking for a clean room, great location, and great price, keep reading! We booked a Sunday-Friday stay and our room rate was $30 a night.

Housekeeping was consistent, every day we returned to a freshly made room and towels, never ever had a problem (this was our third stay at Harrahs). The Buffet of Buffets is a great deal @ $45. You basically get four meals (more if you want) for $11 per meal, at your choice of 8 buffets. We sampled many of them, until we found our favorite, even to the point of only eating a dessert or getting a drink at one of them. I was perplexed at the long lines for check out.

We rented a car, and there was ample parking even though it was Chinese New Year during our stay and the place was PACKED!

Arrived much earlier than check in time at 4pm and a room was available. Check in was smooth and the staff excellent. A king room was not available, but I was able to get into a double queen room right away. To my surprise, there was a Starbucks in the lobby right next to the elevators. Yay! Once I got to my floor, it was a non-smoking designated floor and no trace of cigarette smoke - Thank you!!! Room appeared clean, neat, and smelled great. I actually felt a little spoiled. Although my view was the roof of some part of the building w/the pipes and exhaust, I had a great view of The Mirage and the other hotels on The Strip. To my surprise, again, I was able to see the volcano show at The Mirage from my room! There was some noise with the exhaust from the pipe(s), a/c - you can turn off, volcano show, and delivery trucks (infrequent), but it wasn't to the point of annoyance. I slept well and I felt very comfortable. Some people say you don't go to Vegas to watch TV, but I do like to have a TV in my room to help me sleep and entertain me between the times I come and go. Good channels offered. I did notice as I was plugging in my notebook, the outlet under the desk was a coated with dust - didn't look like it gets touched regularly. A little scary with all the outlets in use and the plugs loose in the sockets, but not a major issue for me. No dust in the corners or near the beds, clean linens, clean bathroom, no dust or scary things in sight other than the outlet dust. Harrah's has great places to shop within the casino. I signed up for Total Rewards which was right off the lobby and in the casino. I recommend you sign up for the Total Rewards program as you can rack up lots of perks from gambling and also shopping at participating resorts! :) I didn't hit it big in the slots, but it was fun nonetheless. Everyone was super nice, the only person I had a \"thing\" with was the a gentleman cashier in the casino. The $5 Free Play ticket was not working and I was asked by the Total Rewards employee (who replaced my cards after I had difficulty registering my original card in the slot machines) to see the cashier for a replacement ticket. Right off he was defensive and said that the hotel gives out many of the tickets everyday and they have no problems. I repeated my question and request and got clarification on how to use the ticket and my card. Turned out it was my Total Reward card and not the ticket that was malfunctioning. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt in that he was having a moment, although, good customer service is not great customer service. In the lobby they have the concierge, gift shop, other shops, and seated chair massage. Many restaurants to choose from within the hotel/casino and Starbucks, of course, carries fresh sandwiches and salads if you just need a quick bite. See the Mac King show if you can, I ran out of time to see it on this trip but I hope to see it next time. If you need mail services or the business center, it is on the 2nd floor of the Mardi Gras tower - easy to access elevator is in the lobby. I had to mail postcards and it was so easy and convenient. They have stations to print your boarding pass for a fee right by the elevators, if needed. Very nice. Right by the elevators there are express checkout desks, but the best part is that you can do video check out from your room! A first for me. I had no room charges so it was quick. Instructions are provided by the TV. Just drop off your key cards in the express checkout slot and you're done. Harrah's is located perfectly along The Strip. It's in the middle of everything and I just love the vibrancy of Vegas, so I was able to make the most of my solo vacation. Since my return flight was a late one, upon check out I was able to leave my bags at the luggage center right outside of the lobby. I had a great time and plan to return. Yes, I was approached by Wyndam employees by the casino entrance/exit, but they were very nice and not pushy. If you're a non-smoker, you will survive in this hotel as I found lots of non-smoking spots to eat, gamble, and browse in this hotel. Oh yeah, NO RESORT FEES!!! Thanks for reading. :) Oh yeah, this is a great hotel for extended stays.

Stayed in Deluxe rooms in the Carnaval Tower. Very quiet on the back side near the parking garage. The side on The Strip can be noisy, especially if you're on the lower floors because of the Carnaval Court bands. The great room rates and lack of resort fees make Harrah's stand out. The other hotels nearby charge A LOT MORE and they really stick it to you with the infamous resort fees. Harrah's is also very convenient for getting out to other locations on the strip. Saves a ton on taxi fares. Plenty of free parking if you have a vehicle. We didn't dine here much....and the little dining we (attempted) turned out to be a pretty bad experience. Tried to have breakfast 2 days in a row at Harrah's Cafe. I say tried because it never happened! We got down there in plenty of time to make it to the trade show but on both days, we gave up after not being served in 30 minutes!! Not good. Ended up grabbing McDonalds next door in a rush to get to the show. This same experience happened to us a couple years ago.......should've known better but we hoped things had changed. We even prompted the server when we finally flagged her down that we needed to order quickly and be served in a timely manner. This is very frustrating......especially when the place wasn't even busy (maybe 15-20 people in the cafe, tops). Saw others leaving without their food, too. We mostly ate at Toby Keith's Bar & Grill in Harrah's and California Pizza Kitchen right across the street in Mirage and other restaurants within a few minute walk. Tons of places to eat within 10 minutes. The Range Steakhouse at Harrah's is great but a little pricey (but most steak houses in Vegas are really pricey).

Very clean and no complaints Hotel: This place is big! I got lost a few times lol has that \"old vegas\" feel to it, but everything is pretty new and modern. There are lots of slots/tables/ to play at, and the waitresses were quick to make sure you always had a drink(tipping also helps with this). And there is also a Starbucks located down stairs by the lobby, BONUS! Location: Right in the heart of Vegas centrally located on the strip. Within walking distance to other hotels and casinos (caesars palace, treasure island, mirage etc.) There is also a mcdonalds right next store Food: During our stay we ate a few times at the buffet at Harrah's. For only $22 we ate like kings! The variety of food was great! ( the first night I stuffed myself with king crab, rib eye steak, tamales halibut u name it, they had it!) the drink was also included with the price. I would definately recommmend their buffet! My only negative comment would be that there was alot of people smoking inside, which I guess to a smoker is a bonus. Also, where are all of the clocks? You lose all sense of time when your in Vegas unless you have a watch!

So we weren't expecting much for that price but we were pleasantly surprised. The room was on the 23rd floor non-smoking, it looked out over the parking garage but beyond that you could see the mountains, so it wasn't bad. It had a flat screen tv & a room safe. There weren't any king rooms available so there were 2 beds but we didn't mind. The bathroom was not huge but plenty of counter space, however, only 1 sink. Maid service was fine. The flavors buffet was really good. We did the 24hr. buffet for 45.00 we could get 4 meals out of it and you could go to any harrahs property. The best was Rio but Flavors at Harrahs was good & also Planet Hollywood's buffet was good too. Do Not go to Imperial Palace buffet it was very small & the food was not very good. Harrah's is right across from Ceasars & close to Venitan, Bally's Paris , & Planet Hollywood. Paris buffet was also good. The slots at Harrahs were good, won quite a bit on our first night but of course put it all back by the end of the week. Toby Keith Bar smelled good but we did not go in because it was SO LOUD & with country music which I can't stand. The lines for the buffets were long but because we are platinum card holders we were able to get right in, so if you are platinum, diamond or 7 stars there is a seperate entrance. Also check- in was also seperate so we did not wait at all. We were able to get a room right next door to our friends.They also printed our boarding passes for free the day before we left. All the staff were nice & helpful. The bad part was the long line at Starbucks in the morning because there were a lot of convention people.

It was a nice room and the bathroom was very large and clean, though it looked like a bathroom from the late 80's. The bathroom was all tile, from floor to ceiling, and nice in design, and would be considered a high-end bathroom of the late 80's. The room was clean and the bed was nice and plush. The furniture looked okay - no evident signs of wear. Our room had a side view of the strip, which was nice. We slept well and didn't hear any noises of folks walking outside or our neighbors. As for as the location is concerned, you really can't find a better value for the location. It's central strip and its located next to some very nice hotels (Venetian, Bellagio, etc.). Also, when you walk outside Harrahs, you are next to the small food court that's located on the strip with the McDonalds, Chipotle, and Panda Express (and maybe one or two more places...). This is especially good if you're traveling with a family and want to eat quick and cheap. Also, in terms of location, I will say that the Harrahs is very close to the booth where you can purchase show tickets at 50% off. This booth (forgetting the name) opens around 10 AM, so its a quick walk from your hotel and you can purchase tickets the shows the same day for significantly less than the box office. We used the valet service at Harrahs, which was very quick and courteous. They had heat-lamps outside, which made it okay to stand outisde in the cold while you waited for your vehicle. In the hotel, they have a Starbucks, which definitely comes in handy when you're up late or you wake up early. I would avoid Harrah's buffet - it's not a very good buffet.

The tv could use some updating and they had a mini bar fridge but they had a huge STOP sign warning you not to use the fridge to cool your own drinks. We weren't tempted to use it because it wasn't cold anyways. They nickle and dime you to death at this place. No free wifi, you have to pay for all internet useage. No free phone calls either, $1.50 a shot. No free coffee in the lobby either. You can line up to pay $5 for a Starbucks coffee. I discovered a McDonalds next door with free wifi (had a lot of trouble using it) and decently priced coffee. We didn't eat at Harrahs so I can't comment on the food. They have servers walking around to bring you free drinks. Make sure you tip really well or you will have a hard time getting them to come back. Check in was easy and quick and the lady at the front desk was really nice and helpful. The cleaning staff were super and pleasant. In fact most of the staff that we dealt with were great. Harrahs is in one of the best locations on the strip so it's convenient for sight seeing along Las Vegas Boulevard. Overall I had a good time at Harrahs and I probably would stay here again. The only problem we had was that we were charged over $4 for taking a toothbrush from the mini bar, which we never touched. I explained that to the lady on the phone who was really rude and snapped at me while I was nicely trying to explain that we didn't take the toothbrush. Bottom line, we didn't have to pay for the d__n thing.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "western pa.", "Title": "\u201cBack to harrahs\u201d", "Author": "guzzman", "ReviewID": "UR123002931", "Content": "Hi all.....been to vegas 8 times now...usually stay at harrahs.....got the chance to spend the weekend there recently....being from pa where gambling is close to home, we dont get vegas that often any more and we heard how things had gone downhill due to economy.....being a loyal harrahs patron for alot of years, here is my impression as of january 2012....first, location is still great....center of the strip.....we used carry on bag on plane as it was a 2 night trip.......we breezed through mcarran airport and got the bel tran shuttle to harrahs....well worth the 6.00 fee......the cabs rip you off.......it was a friday night as we got to harrahs......was 6:30 pm.......line was kinda long to check in......the earlier you can get there the better....we waited around 15 minutes to check in......we had the room comped.....it was a classic but lady upgraded us to mini suite because we hadnt been there for a while......she was pleasant......we were in the mardi gras tower.....4 th floor.........overlooking the pool area.......pool is closed so it was ok for us......non smoking room......no noise....room was clean and beds were great.....had a 42 inch flat screen.....also a safe in the room which we always use.......bathroom was clean and had a 22 inch tv in it.....also a coffee pot and a hair dryer........shower pressure was very good.......also plenty of towels, soaps, etc......room keys worked well......a c in the room worked by sensor....was very quiet.......only thing, the air seemed dry......not bad though......in all, very happy with this room......maid service was excellent in the morning.............now, lets go downstairs........casino is ok for us........had alot of newer machines that we liked.....we did ok....

Another plus is the ease of getting in & out of parking garage, both to drive out and to get from garage to lobby/check in area - much closer and easier access than many of the humongous Vegas hotels.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ellenwood, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cBad services, good location!\u201d", "Author": "legstogo", "ReviewID": "UR122223476", "Content": "The stay started out bad.

While I love the casino, I don't know if we'll be staying here again. We booked the room using AA Vacations so we could use my airline miles. When we got here they said they had no regular king rooms available. Had the area been booming with jolly Christmas tourists, I'd believe it. But I've never seen so few people in Vegas, so I have to believe we got a base room because we used my airline miles instead going directly through Harrah's. The room itself isn't horrible. Think La Quinta. However, the bathtub faucet won't quit running, we're directly over the heat/air units so there's a constant whirring. Also the bathroom lighting is yellow, so putting makeup on is a trial. The bed in comfy though, so that's a plus. Don't plan on using the TV while in the room. Even The Weather Channel is bad; however, you don't come to Vegas for TV, so maybe I should give the lousy cable/satellite service props for getting customers out in the gaming rooms spending money. The cafe was one of the biggest disappointments. almost $30 for eggs, bland potatoes and sausage links. You can definitely do better elsewhere on the strip. I wish we'd stood in the Starbucks line, grabbed coffee and banana nut bread instead. AND the Starbucks Internet that's free everywhere else, isn't free in Harrah's if you book through an AA Vacations program. I think we'll be back at MGM next time we come to town. One positive: the housekeeping and maintenance people are beyond nice. Also we wanted a late check out. When we checked in the girl at the desk said it wouldn't be a problem and if we'd just call down the day we left, the front desk would take care of that for us. She said it might cost $20 for a half day rate. When we tried to do so, the front desk person said no. Or yes, but only if we paid for an entire extra day.

My room had a great view of Las Vegas and of the strip. There are some comedy shows in the hotel as well as restaurants. Don't find yourself saying Las Vegas has good food because it doesn't. Not even Toby Keith's place in Harrah's is any good. The casino itself is like any other Vegas casino on the strip. The \"cheaper\" gambling is located off the strip in Downtown Las Vegas. The cheapest in the city being El Cortez. Harrah's is less glitzy than most modern Vegas hotels but it is close to all of them and you can stay here for a fraction of the price. It lacks a \"theme\" like most other Las Vegas hotels but it tries to maintain a middle-eastern one which it fails at.

We had booked the lowest rated \"Classic\" room, and were offered at upgrade to a remodeled room for $15/night, so we took it. It was still the best deal on the strip.

Food was expensive in the cafe, so hubby headed to McDonalds every morning right next door to grab us coffee, juice and food. It was much cheaper and very convenient. The location was perfect!! For SEMA, Harrahs being on the monorail made it easy and convenient to get back and forth to the convention center. For activities on the strip, Harrahs location was perfect as well! It was an easy walk to upscale shows and restaurants at Caesers, the Venetian/Palazzo, Bellagio, Cosmo and Aria. When we wanted some $5 Craps or Blackjack tables on the strip, Casino Royale was next door and Shea's was a very short walk away. Carnival Court always had music and fun at all hours when we just wanted to sit down, have a drink and people watch. Sure, the casino was a bit on the smoky side, but most of them are. Overall, the value was amazing. A great room, a great location and a very low rate for the week we were there. We had an amazing time! We would def choose Harrahs again.

Four of the six nights were comped and I was able to book a Deluxe room for the remaining two evenings at a good price. Received prompt confirmation of my booking and my preferences: non-smoking. Check-in: This is where you find out what \u201cPreferences\u201d really means. I had e-mailed ahead to confirm our stay and to request that the Deluxe room be on a high floor away from the noise of Carnaval Court. The reality? Although I had paid a extra to book a Deluxe room, I was told upon check-in that the room type I\u2019d booked was a Preference and not a Guarantee. Fair enough but then why charge more for the Deluxe? Our arrival was disappointing and not a fabulous way to start my week in Vegas. The gentleman who checked us in also said that it was best to close up our account at the onset which we found out later did not allow us to charge items to our room (ie. buffets, etc). Room: Ended up in Carnival Tour in a Luxury Room that overlooked \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Carnaval Court. We were high enough that it was only mildly annoying as long as we kept the window shut at night but during our last stay we were on the other side of the hotel and were able to keep the window open at night which kept it cooler when the motion-controlled A/C turned off at night. As we weren\u2019t able to do that this trip, we occasionally had wave our arms to try and get the A/C going again. The room itself had a comfortable king bed and overall was still a good value considering we were able to have four nights comped. Housekeeping: Excellent! Room was clean and our towels and other amenities were replaced as required. Buffet: Purchased the Buffet of Buffets and started with a late breakfast in Harrah\u2019s. Once again the food was good and the service was excellent. Mac King Comedy Show: Had a ticket for free admission with the purchase of two drinks at $9.95 each and paid $5 extra each for VIP admission which also gave us a 2 for 1 buffet VIP buffet pass in the hotel. This show was absolutely worth the cost as Mac King was excellent \u2013 entertaining and funny. Overall: The room wasn't what I expected and if they'd given me the room I'd booked (or even a Luxury room that didn't overlook Carnaval Court) - that would have made this a four star stay.

Upon booking our trip like 7 months ago, I read lots of reviews on TA as I always do before planning a trip and like all places I read good and bad and decided to go with Harrah's for price and convenience. We had never stayed there, and hadn't been to Vegas in 11 years. Last visit we stayed at NYNY. Upon checkin we were offered to take the upgrade for add'l $15/night. I said let's check the room first, you never know. So we did. The room appeared fine, the bed was very comfy and since we didn't plan to spend time in the room we decided to stay with original booking. It was very mediocre. There wasn't even a comfy chair to sit in, just a small table with 2 dinette type chairs and the tv was old, but the room appeared clean and did not smell, it was o.k. Then the shower head was awful! There was not much pressure and the water leaked onto the floor and made a huge puddle. Hubby wanted to leave and go to upgrade and prob. could/should have, but didn't want to lug my stuff to another room, because the bed was very comfortable and that's really number one on our list. So, overall, I guess you get what you pay for, right? The location is prime, I mean it is right in the middle of the strip and the restaurants we ate in were good. Toby Keith's I Love This Bar is upstairs and was alot of fun. The piano bar is great, the bands out in the carnival court were usually really good and they had heaters out there and it was very comfortable at night. Overall I have to say average because the leaky shower would bring it way down, and lack of a comfy chair to lounge in too, but then the comfy bed and convenient location and other amenities that are right there, bring it back to average. We would not stay here again just because there are so many other options and we'd try another place, but it might not be until another 10 years or so. Overall Vegas is too damn smokey!

Nice flat screen TV's in room and the bathroom (not that we watched them). Bed was really comfortable pillow top mattress, nice linens and overall great comfortable space. We had a room with sliding glass doors to a very small balcony. This overlooked Carnaval Court. Other reviewers had mentioned that it is really loud and I was concerned when we checked in. However, when the glass doors are closed you can barely hear the music. I liked feeling a part of the party, from our room and it kept the lively Vegas feel still going, while sitting in your room or getting ready for a night on the town. We also had a small view of the Bellagio fountains and a bit of the strip. I have also read a lot of reviews on the air conditioner sensor. The system will only come on if it detects movement in the room. During our stay the temperature outside was in the 90's. When we would first come back to the room it was quite warm, but as soon as the air conditioner turned on, it cooled off very quickly. No complaints with this system. Check in was a breeze and we arrived on a Saturday at 3:30pm. The front desk was more than accomodating in looking to see what rooms were available to ensure we got just what we wanted. Check out was just as easy. No line-ups! There is a good choice of restaurants. We went to the breakfast buffet and there was a great assortment to choose from and everything was very tasty. We also tried KGB Burger and the burgers were really good. The portion sizes are really big too. There was no way we could each eat a burger and fries, so we split it. There is a $2 charge to split meals, but in the long run cheaper than buying two meals that we wouldn't have finished. I signed up for the Total Rewards program. The bonus was the coupon book. We were able to use the buffet coupon and paying $10/person for breakfast to each as much of what you want was reasonable. Unfortunately, this was a quick trip and we didn't get a chance to use any others at the Harrah's group of hotels (Flamingo, Caesars, Imperial Palace, Planet Hollywood, Bally's).

The next day, both my sister-in-law and I went to the room together, and neither key worked. We were given several reasons - improper insertion (really???), the battery in the lock could be dying, maybe the latch had flopped over.... Another relative staying on the same floor, other wing had her toilet overflow. It took FOUR phone calls to the front desk to get someone up to fix it. By this time, it had run into the hall (thankfully not in her room). She was comped $50. And another relative lost her cell phone. Someone called her, and was told that Security had it. From some of the weird conversations back and forth, we were not sure if security really had it, or if someone was just pretending to be. Then she was told that Lost & Found was not open on weekends.

The hotel was very accomodating. we had to wait, but so what we we did arrive early and, there were nine of us. They were not adjoining but we were fine with that. We had three rooms on the 15th floor., #s: 1533, 1535 & 1537. The beds were comfortable enough with comfy down comforters. The water was nice and hot but the water pressure was lacking. This was only my second trip to Vegas and I was told that that is a common thing in Vegas. With the water issue it wasn't a big deal. The drainage in the tub was terrible though, The air in my room, 1537, was clearly not working properly but the other two rooms were perfect. Housekeeping did a great job and were super friendly ladies. Tips were well deserved. The casino in Harrah's is, in my opinion, not so hot, it's dark and feels very confined, but I didn't spend much time in it anyway. TIP - for cheap and fun gambling hop on over the O'Shea's just next door. If your not familiar with tables games, as some of my girlfriends weren't, the dealers are GREAT. yes, it's old and a bit divey but good times. I didn't visit the pool - we were pretty unlucky with weather, but a couple of he girls did and said it was pretty cool and would've been fun to hang out at for at least a day if the weather was right. The Spa-one of the girls said it was really nice. Not the top of the line but she had a facial and a massage and loved them both. She told me the facilities were clean and welcoming. If I had had the time I so would have had a body treatment. Room service-tasty and a bit pricey but not really that pricey for what you get and, it's room service so it's always a bit more expensive. Restaurants- Starbucks. imited selection of food but the salads, muffins and breads are top notch and with no coffee pots in the rooms we had it was nice to have it in the buidling. There is also a McD's next door for cheaper, tastieer coffee anyway. I'm a Dunkin girl so Starbucks is just.. Starbucks, Friends went to the cafe for breakfast and it was good. Nothing extraordinary. Toby Keiths and KGB-both AWESOME!!!! Toby Keith's is down home fun. We went there a couple of times and all the food was delicious, especially the BBQ sandwich. KGB's burgers are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!

The hotel rooms are so so. The first room we stayed in the water would not shut off in the tub and it ran all night and we also were kept up with very loud banging and talking from a dumpster being emptied several times during the night. I called the desk and they changed my room to the other side of the hall. The second room had a leak in the ceiling that soaked the bathroom floor and splashed water all over the toilet. I let the desk know and it was fixed asap. In the second room I could hear a whistle blowing every few minutes from valet and the room was on the sixth floor. I bought ear plugs in the lobby and it did block out the noise. The casino is very smokey and the ventilation system is terrible. The location of the hotel is good but the homeless, drunks, loud music, half naked girl dancing in a cage, litter on the ground and the men and women handing out cards for hookers to come to your room in 20 minutes or less make Harrah's a two star at best. I would not feel comfortable walking with just women out in front of Harrah's down to Bills gambling hall and saloon. It was very, very seedy. I am not a prude and understand what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas and have had my share of fun, but a three star hotel should not allow what goes on the the front of the hotel to happen! I ended up going across the street to Ceasar's and the Mirage to gamble and eat(Ceasar's has a good food court)The higher end hotels do not allow the sleazy people conduct themselves in front of their establishments. I spent my first night at the South Point Casino and Spa off the strip because Harrah's was booked. Thank God I did some family stayed at the Imperial Palace(booked through Harrah's) the first night and told me there were prostitutes in the lobby and the rooms were terrible. I laughed when they told me when they looked out their window the roof above the valet had liquor bottles and luggage on it. It just sums up the overall feel of this section of the strip. My stay at South Point was very similar in price but feel and experience were night and day. One day we took a free shuttle to The Red Rock Casino because our group of 14 people wanted a change of scenery and we had a great time. The shuttle picks you up and drops you off at the Fashion Mall Valet. We had a great time and it was good to get away from Harrah's. A person in our party summed up the feel of this part of the strip as a combination of the Jersey Shore and the Atlantic City Boardwalk rolled into one. Two people in our party went to workout at the gym and were told they had to pay twenty dollars per person each day to use the gym!! Are you kidding me, they advertise no resort fees! This is only true if you do not want to use any of the facilities amenities. Charging a $25.00 a day per room resort fee is better than $40 a day to use an average gym. I do have to say that every employee we encountered at Harrah's was wonderful. They were always pleasant and helpful. I feel bad for them because they work very hard and it is not their fault the hotel is a little run down and sleazy out front. I would recommend staying at a higher end hotel. As a women I did not feel comfortable walking outside the hotel alone and my husband agreed. This is not my first time in Vegas, but it is the first time I felt uncomfortable. I have stayed at the Luxor, Mandalay Bay, Monte Carlo, Bally's, Excalibur, MGM, Paris, the Stratosphere and Treasure Island. I never felt uneasy walking alone in front of these hotels except for the stratosphere and Harrah's. It was not worth staying here for the cheap rate and I would gladly pay more so I can enjoy my vacation. I guess you get what you pay for. I traveled with people who had comp rooms with Harrah's and I was given friends and family rate of $40 per night. This was one of the few times I did not use priceline to get a good rate at a better hotel and I will be the last. I would recommend to anyone who is thinking of staying here don't!! pay more and gamble a little less and you will not regret it. I would also recommend staying off the strip at Red Rock, South Point or Green Valley Ranch they have everything you could possibly want and offer free shuttles to and from the strip. The food at the Harrah's was very pricey and sometimes not so good. I found the food at higher end hotels similar in price for casual to moderate dining. There is no food court at Harrah's therefore limited casual dining choices. My last day I went to Ceasar's food court and payed the same price for lunch but the choices and quality was much better than Harrah's. A friend went to Johnny Rockets at the Flamingo Hotel a few doors down and spent $20.00 on a hamburger, fries and a drink! I felt like I was staying at the airport with the food prices. This was not just Harrah's, but everywhere on the strip. It your in the area go see Mac King's show at Harrah's they offer two adult free tickets but you have to buy one drink so the ticket ends up being $12 per person. Fun show a little corny but worth it.

The room was very nice for Harrahs, it was updated with a nice couch two 32 inch lcd tv's, had a seperate shower and tub. Harrahs has motion activated hvac systems, I called and had maintenance come deactivate that feature, they were there within 10 minutes.

We spent most of our time seeing the sights since it was her first visit to Vegas. I spent most of saturday and sunday in Harrahs Sportsbook with 3 friends that came the same time we did. We also enjoyed the Imperial Palace for Craps and their BJ dealertainers. Carnival Court was LOUD as always, we enjoy that sometimes but this was a getaway from the kidos weekend. (thanks gparents!) We enjoyed Harrahs environment since we are more middle class. The Venetian, Caesars and Aria are great to look at and very nice but if you cant afford anything in their shops whats the use. Another great experience was at PJ Clarks over in the Forum Shops of Caesars, they offer $1 oysters at happy hour, sit at the bar where the guys are shucking them for a better experience. Also had the Lago Buffet at Caesars, prime rib was worth going back for. My wife really enjoyed her visit to the Spa by Mandara which is located inside Planet Hollywood.

Especially for the price. I liked where they have the check-in area. Although it's located at the back of the hotel, it makes it much easier to get in and out of the hotel. This is important when your trying to avoid a extremely crowded strip on most any night. Rooms are okay. Try to stay away from the pool side if you want a quiet evening. I understand the bands are very loud and go on late into the night. I heard them when we were out.........and they are loud. Because of it's location, you can walk to most of the other major hotel casinos and you're pretty much in the middle of all the action.

I will write a seperate reviw for each of the two hotels we stayed at. This one for Harrah's only. I had read several reviews about how the AC units could not be set to a comfortable temperature because they are on an echo friendly system and that was a real concern for me because there is nothing worse than coming in for the night to a hot room and no way to set the temperature. We asked upon check in if that could be fixed and the girl at the reception desk said she would send someone up to fix it. As soon as we got in our room someone was knocking at the door to overide the system.... it worked perfectly.We had a nice $16.00 cab ride from the airport...told the driver we wanted the cheapest route and that is what we got. $16.00 + tip divided three ways was not bad at all. Arrived at the hotel at around 11:00 a.m. and only had to waite in line about 10 minutes before we got our room. We were not asked which tower we wanted so we just took our chances. We got a room in the back of Carnival Court... nice and quite. short walk from the elevator and no noise at all. Beds were comfortable and no little creatures sleeping with us. There was not much of a view but we were not in Vegas for the view. We went down to play some slots and get something to eat. We ate at Flavors and were surprised at how many choices the buffett had. It was pretty good. Again we had a coupon for buy one get one free, spit three ways stilll not bad ...about $11.00 each. Slots were very tight and no one won any money there. We decided after the first night that this was a very large casino and all of us being in our late 50's were not up to all of the walking around and we needed something smaller next time. All of the staff were very friendly and we were close to many of the other casinos on the strip and easy to walk to Imperial Place, Casino Royal, O'Sheas, Flamingo. Caesars. and Bills. We had a great time and enjoyed our stay at Harrah's. The only thing that was a little bit of a dissipointment to us was to see the half naked girls dancing on a small stage up in the air around the table games which were right by the entrance to the caino. All of the small children going by the doors could watch this. I am not a prude but ths was a little bit too much for smaller children to see. They need to have them sort of in the middle of the casino but of course it is all about the marketing and what will draw people in. The bus ride up and down the strip was miserable. They pack you in like cattle and keep telling you to move back when there is no room to back up to. Quite a few homeless people on the streets begging for money or cigarettes so be careful of being alone on the streets anywhere. There are also alot of drunks stubling around.

I obtained a fabulous deal for flights and accommodation through Travel bag but it did involve 3 flights there and back! Not for the faint hearted. Having gotten such a good deal I was a little worried about the hotel standard. I have been to Las Vegas before so I knew Harrahs was in a good location and furthermore I checked previous comments on Tripadvisor about the hotel but quite frankly they did not do it justice. If you want five star do not even consider Harrahs but for a no frills four star this is your place! I booked a smoking room and when I arrived the Receptionist said she had none. I was about to complain when she offered a room with a balcony which you could smoke on - first tick for the hotel. The room was close to the lift ( without asking ) thus near the ice machine and soft drinks machine. Some might think this would be a noisy locale but we were not disturbed. Room had two large double beds, 37 inch LCD LG TV and a smaller one in the bathroom!!! The room was immaculately cleaned every day and extra towels left without having to ask. - big tick here! We were not overlooking the swimming pool nor the night club so no noise disturbance but in fact could see the Mirage hotel opposite and a great view of the mountains in the distance ( fantastic sunsets!) Looking down wasn't the best view - but who's looking down! Staff were friendly in all areas- quite frankly can't say enough about them especially as it was so busy and they still kept smiling! Loved the Oyster Bar, loved drinks in the pool - watch out for the cocktails in the Harrah cups - $17.00 a pop but you only need one; but beyond a doubt the best thing about Harrah's is the dueling piano bar. It is rocking from Thursday to Saturdays; still good on the other nights but not quite as busy. it closes at 2am so we would get there from 12 on wards. There are many places to go to in Las Vegas but loved coming back to the piano bar. When that is closed if you have any energy go to the night club outside the entrance to the hotel - another rocking place! Las Vegas has become more expensive over the time I have been going there but of course the free drinks at the slots and gambling tables can make a difference there and you can still eat cheap if you look around. But make Harrah's you base.

When she found out we were in town to get married she really went out of our way to make our stay special. She made sure to have our room clean before it was time for us to get ready for the ceremony. And, the morning after our wedding she gently reminded some of our guests that we had the Do Not Disturb sign on our door. At check in we asked if there were any free upgrades availble for us. The front desk clerk was unable to accomodate us for the first night but put a room with a better view on hold for us for the rest of the week. The next day, when we entered our new room we discovered that not only did we get an awesome view but we were also upgraded to an awesome room. The cocktail waitresses in the casino provided the best service on the strip in my opinion. I asked about some lessons on table games becasue I noticed that the hotel's website advertised that free instruction was available daily. However, I asked three different people and all told me that they did not give any instruction on any of their games. So many other casinos do though so we just went to a different casino to learn craps. The quality and price of food was average for Las Vegas, good but nothing special. The Carnival Court bar was our favorite just because it was the most lively on the strip the week we were there. All of the other bars were dead for some reason.

I would have to spend 1 night in handicapped then would be moved the following day. They wanted to charge me for every night & the amount quoted by the lady at the front desk was extremely high. I said no way, I want to talk to a manager. He did talk to me & got the cost lowered, but it was still high.

The supervisor was very concerned about the mix up, he spoke with someone in Total Rewards and the bottom line is I got upgraded to a deluxe room in the Mardi Gras Tower & my total bill was $30.00 I told the supervisor I wanted a smoking room, Mardi Gras is total non-smoking now but he gave me a room with a balcony overlooking the pool so I was able to smoke out there. My deluxe room was very nice, 2 plasma tv's, coffee maker & an awesome bed. Housekeeping gave me fresh linens & towels every day. Had a couple problems with air conditioning but upon calling front desk they had someone up to fix it within 15 minutes.

My room was in the Mardi Gras tower on the fourth floor. It overlooked a roof with ducts, so the view was not scenic, to say the least, but the room was very quiet, with no noise coming in from outside. The room was a Deluxe room and it was very clean with marble (or marble-like) floors and two flat-screen TVs (one in the bathroom), and Corian or equivalent counters in the bathroom. It had two queen beds that were a bit soft but ok for sleeping. The bathroom was smallish but very useable. Both the bathroom and the bedroom could have used more lighting, but that seems to be a general problem in hotels these days. My room was no-smoking, and I did not smell any smoke in it or in the hallway. My only real problem with the room was the lack of storage space for clothing. This space was part of a large cabinet housing a TV and (pay as you go) refrigerator. There was room to hang only a few articles of clothing (and some of this room was taken up by the ironing board), and there were three very small drawers to hold socks, underclothing, etc. All this space was just adequate for me, as I was by myself, but I really think it would have bee inadequate for two or more people, especially those who travel with more clothes than I do, which is probably almost anyone. I do not know anything about Harrah's rooms that are cheaper than the Deluxe ones, but I would recommend not to go with these rooms if you can afford the Deluxe rooms. My room was fine as it was except perhaps for the lack of clothing space, but I think any rooms that were not up to Deluxe standards might be inadequate for some people. Some Tripadvisor reviews have warned about the air conditioning at Harrah's, which uses a motion sensor. While I was away from the room all day, the air conditioner worked minimally, and when I got back it was always at 76 degrees, which actually did not feel warm at all. (I kept my window shade closed all the time.) When I would walk in, the air conditioner would come on and quickly cool the room down to 66-68. During the night (some people have said the air conditioning doesn't work well at night, since sleepers aren't moving around enough), the air conditioner stayed on, and it was still in the high 60s range when I woke up, so the temperature at night remained very comfortable. I ate at KGB and The Range in Harrah's, and the food at both places was very good. All in all, I think Harrah's is a good value for the Deluxe rooms, with a very central location, and it almost seemed as if the people in the casino were enjoying themselves more than I saw elsewhere.

We had no problems with our reservations. The room was very nice and clean, albeit a little on the small side. But hey...how much time were we going to spend in it anyway? We had a choice of view from pool-facing (we were warned this would be noisy until 4am) or not much of a view but quiet. We went with quiet as our days of partying until 4am are past. We actually ended up with a decent view of Treasure Island and Venetian facing north for what it's worth. The room had two flat screen TVs (one in the bathroom) but the cable service does not offer HD. There was a small fridge intended for mini-bar but were were able to squeeze one or two leftover containers in it. As for the rest of the resort, it's in a great, central location at about the center of the strip, which means most other resorts, restaurants and shows are within actual walking distance. The casino at Harrah's is fairly decent (despite some reviews you read) and no more run down than most others. If want the Wynn, go there! Carnival Court is an ok place to hang out (just outside the casino between Imperial Palace). The bartenders are entertaining to watch and the bands at night are decent. We ate only at Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill. It was decent, not wonderful. I had the fried balogna sandwich and it was good. My beer was served in a giant mug. There was a band playing and people dancing and having a good time. Nice country music decor. My wife had to remark about the skimpy outfits worn by the servers and hosts (halter tops and bottoms that say \"HOTTIE\"). I didn't mind. ;-) I understand from others the buffet was pretty good as well. I saw an oyster bar that looked busy and tasty. The steak house looked pretty decent. Next time.. We saw the \"free\" Mac King magic and comedy show. We were provided two vouchers for this at check in. Although you must purchase a drink for each person as part of the ticket cost (about $14 each after tax), the bartender really gave us our money's worth. Mine was like a TRIPLE Jack and Coke!

Our room was in The Mardi Gras Tower. It was a good size and clean, albeit a little 'tired' looking. I feel some upgrading is necessary. Check in was a positive experience for us but, as far as I'm concerned, that's where the customer service ended. We just became faceless guests, who received no benefits from staying at Harrah's. Beware the 'compilmentary' Mac King ticket. If you use it you have to buy two drinks @ $9.95 each. Therefore, the show is not free. Also, if you go to see Mac King you can claim a 2 for 1 buffet voucher. . . but to do this you need to pay $5 each to upgrade to VIP seats, so at Harrah's it's true that nothhing in Vegas is free! The last time we were in Vegas we saw Mac King (who is excellent!) so we asked at Total Rewards if it would be possible to have some kind of concession if we went to the Improv. The answer was no. Then there's the gym! I have never stayed in a hotel where I have been expected to pay to use the fitness suite. It is open from 7am - 7 pm and will cost you $20 if you visit before 4pm. After that it's $10. This seems quite steep when all you want to do is run 5 miles on the treadmill. A couple of years ago we stayed at The Orleans and every time we used the lifts to the rooms we had to show our room card. No such system was in place at Harrah's, so I can only surmise that anyone could go up to the guest rooms. Our room had an adjoining door, so if you are unlucky enough to get a thoughtless neighbour, this could prove to be an issue. We had to put up with some loud television noise on one night. Finally - a security fixed iron! I've never come across that before. It has never crossed my mind to steal an iron from a hotel.

Granted the room was much smaller than the room my son got but we didn't mind. The room was very comfortable and clean. We did have trouble with the noise in the middle of the night even though we were in the Carnival Tower. There was an adjoining room to us and they came in loudly each night at 3 am. We put blankets on the threshhold of the doorway because you could see their lights shining through and hear every word they said. And I realize that it probably works both ways. We will go back to Flamingo next time or maybe try out Bally's. The pool at Harrah's has very little sitting but I went out there early each morning and was able to get a chair. If you got there after 9:30 a.m., you had trouble finding one near the water. I like the pool at Flamingo much better. It's a shame they treated us like they did at check-in because I like many things about Harrah's. Toby Keith's is awesome, the location is fantastic, and the beds are great! We rented a car this trip and it is very easy to access the parking garage from the Carnival Tower. I'm very worried that the lack of the resort fee is going to cause these hotels to start using very bad customer service tactics in order to get more money out of people.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Floral Park, New York", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time!\u201d", "Author": "Pat425", "ReviewID": "UR116582721", "Content": "My husband and I went to Las Vegas with my daughter and son-n-law.

They have a staffed luggage room that you can check your luggage into and you can start your fun right away while waiting for the room to become available. This was a great feature to us. Our check-in was smooth and the staff was very helpful. Our room was very nice. We asked for a non-smoking room and the room did not have any unpleasant odor to it. We also liked the fact that the room had a safe in it. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. Our room was very nice but the only drawback that we found was that the air conditioning was not doing a good job at keeping the room at a comfortable temperature. I know that Las Vegas is very hot in July but the room unit wasn't up to the job. We tried keeping the curtains pulled but the room was at the best, just slightly cool. The hallways were a lot colder than our room. This wasn't isolated to just our room, the couple that traveled with us had the same problem.

My husband told me prior that since the lobby / parking area is around back for Harrah's it would be more cost-effective and faster if we just told the driver to drop us off at Imperial Palace. Which we did, and just walked through the casino to the lobby. Short walk and we had only carry-on. CHECK-IN Arrived early (around 1030am) when check-in is usually 4pm, but luckily our room was ready. ROOM Your basic no-frills kinda room. 2 beds, non-flat/non-HD TV, small table and 2 chairs near the window. Good size washroom (for 3 of us to get ready in). **Our other friends arrived the next day, was asked for a room close to ours and was lucky enough to get the room next to ours which so happened to be adjoining. We used the safe to put our passports, keys and cash, worked out fine. however it's very tall and shallow. (Ex. if you have a laptop you have to stand it up vertical in there). The safe in our friends' room didn't work but we had to be in the room for them to come up and fix it (but the wait was an hour), so they just used ours the whole trip, which was fine. BED Sheets & pillow cased aren't anything to rave about. Feels like your average polyester cotton blend type, but clean and crisp nonetheless. Pillows were to mushy and soft for my liking. BUT getting into bed around 4am every night means that none of this really matters. LOCATION Excellent! Harrah's is the self proclaimed 50-yard line of the Strip, and it's right! It's within walking distance of the other hotels going North or South. The only place we took a cab to was The Hard Rock since it was off the strip. We walked every where else, from Fashion Show Mall to the Coca Cola store. FOOD We ate at the Mitzie's Cafe (i think that's what the name was) the day we left, and the portions are huge! (which we noticed was the standard in vegas). Nothing gourmet but sandwiches and soups were great! Service was good, was seated fairly quickly. CHECK-OUT We received a late check out of noon, flight was at 5pm, so we left our luggage in the room, was given a tag and came back for it. Was all accounted for when we did come back. Service was speedy. CONCLUSION If you're just looking for a place to put your stuff, shower and sleep, this is it!

Housekeeping was great, lovely lady, she noticed the birthday cards in my room and when she saw me in the hallway she asked me if it was my birthday (it was) and she wished me a happy birthday.

Most of my peers had been there many times for the same convention I was in town to attend. I knew what to expect, but I was still off put by a lot of the reality of the hotels. First, smoking indoors...all the time. ALL the time. You can't walk through the lobby without black lung. And memorize your exits as most hotels don't make it easy to get out. To Harrah's credit, however, this was one of the more occupant friendly hotels in that regard. Their restaurants we're actually quite delightful. The burger place on the first floor - fantastic. Side note, get the \"breakfast cupcakes\" - I've been dreaming about them ever since. The rooms were quiet, but that might be because we had no view. I was willing to sacrifice that for proper sleep though. While Harrah's isn't the glitziest and certainly not the most updated, it was affordable and still provided comfort with pizazz. Their on site shows were entertaining (the legends concert isn't as cheesy as you'd think and the comedy was decent) and everything was very walkable. Another thumbs up goes to their staff. They were incredibly accommodating and rather patient when my business partner had lost both our reservation and his credit card. The housekeeping staff was also incredibly gracious whenever we asked for anything. All in all, while Vegas isn't my favorite city, Harrah's was certainly a fantastic haven after a long day at the Convention Center and taking in the city.

Called the front dest to change rooms, but of course was told that they were sold out and no rooms to change.. OK its thurs night.. WHATEVER, but they did offer to \"ionize\" the room. So went to get something to eat, came back and the room smelled better.. enough to go to sleep. The bed was wonderful! It was more comfortable than my bed at home. I thought that I would be cold because ther are no comforters on the bed, but I was was wrong. They have down comforters. I ended up not changing room, but had to get them to ionize it again. There were clean towels and washcloths everyday. The location is perfect. They claim to have a shuttle that takes you to Ballys, and Rio. But the shuttle takes you to the Rio and then you have to get on the shuttle to take you to Ballys. Doesn't make sense because Ballys is closer. Strange. The Carnival Court is nice, from the room I could hear the music, but it was nothing that kept me up or even considered annoying.

Check in was a breeze, fast and the individual that assisted us was friendly and helpful. My husband & I ended up getting a room in the Mardi Gras tower of the hotel. Our room was on the 17th floor and about six rooms away from the elevator, which was great and helpful when we wanted to get to our room quick. The room was average...it was just right. The room was clean, included a safe and extra pillows, ironing board, iron and toiletries. We had a view of the strip and the roof of the casino area. The colors in the room were neutral, mostly browns and tan colors. There are two chairs and a small round table. Lighting could be better, but it was adequate. My husband and I were looking forward to actually putting to good use the mini bar that is supplied in the room. We were surprised to find that it wasn't a mini bar that we were used to. The mini bar contained 4 large bottles of water and shaving cream, razors, tampons, etc. It wasn't what we thought. It also included a sign that stated that we could not place any of our personal drinks in it even though there was plenty of room. All in all, however, the bed was very comfortable---just right after a long day and night at the casino and strip. We had read reviews about complaints on the air conditioner, water pressure and hot water. We had no problems what-so-ever! Water pressure was great and there was plenty of hot water. The air conditioner worked always and it felt good to walk in to our cold room after walking in the 110 degree weather on the strip.

It's like $44.00 and you can eat at any Harrah's/Caesar's owned property's buffet for a 24 hour period.

I was eating so good that I was sick of prime rib and crab legs! Also lounged out at the pool on Friday and Saturday... It is pretty hard finding a place to lay down, but once you do, it's great!

Yeah this place may not be fancy and glitzy like some Vegas properties, it is MORE than suitable. Clean, hopping, and the location is like no other. Plus, the rooms were comped, so even better.

We chose to stay at Harrah's because my husband & I, as well as my in-laws, were able to comp our rooms. My husband & I were given the choice to upgrade our room for $10 a night & we jumped at the chance. We had a great room on the 14th floor in the Mardi Gras tower overlooking the pool with Caesar's Palace to the right of us & the mountains to the left. I had read other reviews of people complaining of the noise from the Carnaval Court below ..... we heard absolutely nothing. We loved the convenience of the location of Harrah's to EVERYTHING from other hotels/casinos & the monorail to McDonalds & other cheaper places to eat. We found that the slot machines in Harrah's brought us luck although the table games just took our money. We greatly enjoyed breakfast in both the cafe & Flavors buffet. We also greatly enjoyed drinks & entertainment in the Carnaval Court at night. My husband & I took advantage of a couples massage on my birthday & were VERY impressed by the couples suite complete with mimosas, fresh fruit, & one of the best massages we have ever had. We never actually went to the swimming pool, but could easily see it from our room. The pool area was VERY small with limited lounge chairs. It was extremely crowded during daytime hours & it was not something we wanted to deal with when we could be exploring the strip. Overall, we enjoyed staying at Harrah's. The rooms aren't as nice as the rooms in other Harrah's hotels (such as the Harrah's in New Orleans), but they are certainly adequate, clean, & comfortable. We stayed at the Vdara in March of 2010 & knew that the two hotels were in totally different classes. However, having that said, Harrah's did not disappoint us, especially since we (voluntarily) paid $40 for 4 nights. We could've paid nothing at all. The only reason why I rated Harrah's a 4 as opposed to a 5 is because of what they did to my in-laws (which honestly, if I based my review on the following, I would've rated it a 1). My in-laws changed the dates that they would be staying at Harrah's a few months before our stay. My mother-in-law changed the reservation online & was given a confirmation number which was the same number as their original reservation. Two days before we planned to leave Vegas, my in-laws were alerted to the fact that they should be checking out the following day. When they went to the front desk to straighten things out, the receptionist insisted that a change in reservation had not been made & that there was \"no way\" the same confirmation number would be given for a changed reservation. Attempting to avoid any further inconvenience, my in-laws requested a room for one night & were willing to pay for it even though it should've been a comp room. The response of the receptionist was that \"according to their point play, there are no rooms available for the night\". That one comment lost the business of my in-laws, who have been loyal to Harrah's for many, MANY years & also lost the business of my husband & I. We checked my in-laws into the Excaliber with no problems the following evening & upon our return to Vegas in January 2012, we will be choosing a MGM/Mirage hotel.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGo grilled cheese\u201d", "Author": "genobear", "ReviewID": "UR115284389", "Content": "Over good experience.

Second, the rooms have decent beds in them which is very important to me. This is why I will not stay at the Paris in a regular room. Have to upgrade to get a decent bed. At Harrah's their standard beds are decent. The rooms are generic with no real flare. A little narrower than usual but this didn't matter. The crowd at Harrah's is a budget crowd. Meaning the folks there are less likely to be interested in what they look like and more interested in playing games. The Casino in my opinion is perfect. It is a gamers casino, not all the flare but straight up gaming. The hotel has a Starbucks! Major plus, however they are slow.

I too had some concerns about security after reading some earlier reviews, but after being there I can say that ended up not being a concern at all. I was in the Mardi Gras tower and had a 'remodeled' room - there was a deadbolt and a door latch in addition to the regular door lock. There was an in room safe as well. There was the usual 'mini-bar' and a small TV in the bathroom as well as the main TV. The AC kept the room cool, and didn't need any kind of 'motion sensor' to keep running - mine ran all the time. I was on the 15th floor and could definitely hear the 'Carnival Court' music downstairs at night. It wasn't extremely loud, and I was able to sleep just fine, but if you are a light sleeper, absolutely ask for a room away from Carnival Court because you WILL be able to hear it. Everyone I dealt with on the staff was very pleasant and courteous. Housekeeping did a pretty good job, no complaints about cleanliness. I only ate breakfast on site, the conference catered lunch and evenings I ventured out to explore and have dinner elsewhere. As far as the restaurants on site, the 'Cafe at Harrahs' is NOT a good deal. $15 for pancakes, plus $6 for a side of bacon? The Flavors Buffet is 'ok', it does the job, although the stories about wonderful cheap Vegas buffets must be a thing of the past - the breakfast buffet was $16, and you are only allowed one type of drink (coffee, juice, milk, etc that is brought to your table) and ice water with breakfast. I did figure out pretty quick though that I could order coffee or juice, and then snag a half pint milk carton where the cereal was. ;) Sorry, but for $16, you should have self-serve beverage w/refills. The food itself was fine, if you're just looking to have a decent breakfast to start out the day. This is an older casino, so the ceilings are low which makes it seem much smokier - the higher ceilings at the newer casinos help with the smoke a great deal. I'm not a big gambler, but I thought the slots were pretty tight, and I didn't run into anyone at the conference that hit anything, but who knows for sure - I probably asked 10 people or so out of 300. There is a free shuttle back and forth to the Rio that runs every half hour until 1 AM, definitely worth going over and doing some gambling over there.

Breakfast at the hotel was slow in service for a sit down breakfast. The is a McDonalds almost next door if all you want is something quick. Displeasing was the amount of people hustling \"Girls to you in 20 minutes\". These people were abundant only in certain locations such as Harrahs and The Flamingo. Didn't see any of them accross the street at Mirage, Bellagio, Paris The city or Harrahs needs to clean this up. A taxi from airport costs $35 to $40, but there is a shuttle for only $6 Also convienient to Harrahs is that there is a Monorail stop directly behind the hotel.

Two really great things about Harrahs: One, they never ever charge resort fees which many other resorts do. Seems strange to me that a casino will charge you an extra $10-20 night for the privilege of using the pool, etc. Secondly, not a biggie, but Harrahs has video checkout which is a nice thing to do if you are in a hurry to leave.

The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, and we were in the Carnival Tower, in the back of the building, Our room was spacious,quiet, very clean, with one of the most comfoartable beds ever. Any questions or concerns were taken care of immediatley. Lots to do within the hotel, we ate at Toby Keiths' Bar and Grill, no cover to get in, with live band and great food. Many other choices within the hotel. Don't be put off by some of the negative reviews...this is a great choice!!!!", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth, Ma", "Title": "\u201cWould think twice!\u201d", "Author": "Tweety629", "ReviewID": "UR108404796", "Content": "We stayed here for a night and a half, we got comped rooms.

Upon check-in we were assigned a room in the mardi-gras tower which appears to be the newer of the two towers. We arrived late and the hotel was full so we were assigned a room on the 3rd floor which is a pet friendly floor and our view was of air conditioning and kitchen vents and a catwalk. Not the best, so we kept our curtains closed. The room did have a nice bathroom with a flatscreen TV and the room also had a flatscreen TV. The bed and the pillows were amazingly comfortable. Unfortunately, after going to bed very late we were woken up at around 6:30 am by screaming kids and an angry mom along with barking dogs. We requested a room change and got it without problem. Our second room was in the carnival tower which had similar rooms but had older tube style TVs and the rooms were not as pretty as they were in the mardi gras tower, but they were bigger and the view was of the pool and strip. We had no problems at all with the room and the beds were just as comfortable. We did have a sight problem with the AC shutting off at night as the AC worked on a motion sensor but was not too big of a deal. The location of Harrah's was amazing as it is mid strip, across from Caesars Palace and within walking distance of most of the main attractions. In terms of location, Harrah's is hard to beat. We did go to the pool on two occasions and I will say that I would not stay here for the pool, it is small and there is not a whole lot of room. We did not have a hard time getting a lounger, but we did have to go to the 2nd level and the 3rd level the second day to get a lounger. The pool is on the first level. The casino is very smoky so for me, it was not the place I want to be, especially when a smoker decides to sit next to you but there are many other casinos that have better ventilation systems that you can play in. I recommend the Wynn or the venetian they are super nice. We did got to two shows, Mystere and Le Reve for which we purchased tickets for at tickets4tonight and got our tickets for less then $100 each for really good seats. Definitely recommend these shows, they were fantastic. We only ate at one restaurant in the Hotel, KGB burger which was great. Best burger I ever had and we were able to use 2 for 1 coupons that we got on check-in. (Be sure to ask for coupons when you check in). They let us use two coupons at our table of 4 for the burgers were less than $10 each with fries. Great deal! They also have these really great sweet potato tots there which are really good.

This was my first time staying at Harrah's and my 4th trip to Vegas with my 18.5 month old. Things that were great about Harrah's: -Location, location, location! It was very central to the places I wanted to visit (Forum Shops at Caesar's and Canal Shoppes at Venetian were both nice places to go with my toddler; both were within close walking distance) -The breakfast buffet was more expensive than I expected, but had food that was of much better quality that I expected---I would recommend it even for the price! -The KGB (Kerry's Gourmet Burger's) was amazing! They had these sweet potato tots that were yummy!! My hubby and I went for lunch while my mom watched my daughter. -We got upgraded to minisuites, which was a pleasant surprise. We got 2 rooms (1 for me, my hubby, and my daughter and 1 for my mom). We may have gotten this because both me and my hubby are Total Rewards members (players club). Although neither or us are huge gamblers, I guess the frequency of out visits helped us out in this case. Oddly, they gave my mom the bigger room of the 2 even though she was alone. -Check in was easy and quick (not always the case in my experience with other Vegas hotels) -Staff was very nice -We got to do a free spin on a slot machine in the Carnival Court because we are Total Rewards members; my hubby won $20 in dining credit while me and my mom got free T-shirts (the minimum prize) -The room rates were very good considering the location. Things I did not like abotu Harrah's: -There is NO WIFI in the rooms! There is a cable to connect to the high speed internet (for a fee), but it's next to the bed, not next to the table! -The casino was very smokey, likely due to the low ceilings. -The rooms are very basic, even our \"mini-suite\" didn't feel luxurious, but clean. -There was no light over the shower, so it was pretty dark when we pulled the curtain to use the shower. -The pool area was too small for the size of the hotel -There was no kiddie pool Just an FYI---some Vegas hotels DO NOT allow you to push STROLLERS in their lobby; I have seen signs outside of some of the fancier hotels stating that they do not allow stroller use because they are concerned for the enjoyment of their guests (i.e., guests without kids).

The Carnaval Court Bar outside of Harrah's is always a party with live music which what seems to be around the clock. Here is the problem: We stayed in the Mardi Gra Tower.

The sign stated basically that in order to conserve the earth's resources, the air conditioner is set to go off when no one is in the room, and then return to normal operations when someone returns to the room. WRONG!!! All it is is a motion sensor on a thermostat. When you leave your room for more than 5 minutes, the air conditioner shuts off until it detects movement inside the room. Then the air conditioner comes back on until it again detects no movement. It all sounds great, right? Well, when you go to bed, if you don't move for more than 5 minutes, the air conditioner shuts off. It doesn't take long in the Vegas heat for the room to heat up. So, you must wave your arm, kick your leg up, or actually get up and move around for the air conditioner to come back on..

This was our second time staying in this hotel after a successful stay in 2007 - liking the location, the value, and the security. This stay, however, proved in so many ways that Harrah's has cut back on their security (and openly admitted it). You need to be aware of this before you make a decision to stay there. After arriving Tuesday afternoon, we were gone all day on Wednesday out sight-seeing and shopping. We left our \"do not disturb\" tag out because we didn't need any fresh linens or our room cleaned. When we returned, my husband immediately went to charge his phone but the charger was missing. After looking around for a couple of seconds he then started looking for money he hid in his suitcase. Our safe was closed upon arrival and he didn't want to carry around extra cash so he hid it between business papers in his suitcase. It was gone. I then noticed that my suitcase had been gone through - nothing missing though. So we were missing a phone charger and money. The first thing we did was call hotel security and they were in our room within 15 minutes. We had to fill out an incident report. We were then told several disturbing things during our conversation with security. We asked how fast it would be before getting footage from the hallway cameras and we were told that Harrahs has NO HALLWAY CAMERAS. We then asked why there wasn't a security officer down by the elevators checking hotel keys/IDs like there was the last time we stayed there. We were told that because of the economy/cuts in staff, they eliminated those positions and security officers walk up and down the hallways every couple of hours or so. Great! So all criminals in Las Vegas know this! We asked about a key entry because housekeeping was right across the hall when we left and our \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign was hanging from our door. He said that he would run our door and see if there was an extra key entry. We haven\u2019t heard anything yet. The security guard checked our door and discovered it didn\u2019t quite close all the way on its own. Well, we had been tugging at it when we left, but there could have been that \u201cone time\u201d that we didn\u2019t. Either way \u2013 doors should be properly maintenanced so this doesn\u2019t happen because apparently there are \u201cdoor pushers\u201d who walk up and down the hallways \u201cpushing\u201d on doors to see if they will open. I expressed my concern about not feeling safe in the room so the security guard talked to the manager on duty and we were moved to a suite (which wasn\u2019t a suite at all, just a little bit bigger regular room). When we went down to switch out our keys we talked to the manager about the lack of security and he told us that it was ILLEGAL to have video cameras in the hallway. What? Then why do the Mirage, Caesars, Bellagio\u2026 all have security cameras in their hallways? I will no longer stay in a hotel without security cameras in the hallways.

The last time was in July 2010 having an upgraded room free to the Carnaval Towers with a strip view (Mirage Volcano can be seen). Most recently got a $50 upgrade to an Executive Suite to the Carnaval Tower. Although some people may say Harrah's is worn down, needs update, etc., the value is exceptional with good service, great location, and comfortable rooms. The suite was amazing with the view of the airport and canyons of Vegas. Bathroom was large with a whirlpool tub, shower, and two sinks. Bedroom was large, which could have fit a walk in closet rather than a small closet for clothes. Bed was comfortable with this pillow I wanted to take home cause it rested my next wonderfully. Living room had a bar with sink and fridge, but wished it had a microwave. The living room also had a sofa bed, which could hold a few more people in the room. The only issue with having a room facing the airport is that you can hear the planes take off up to 2 am in the morning. However, it was not an issue since most of your time spent in Vegas is being up all night. The casino floor had two new slots, Wheel of Fortune and American Idol, which was loose in bonus rounds, but better winnings in Imperial Palace next door. As always, Flavors buffet is a good deal, but wished they didn't use powdered eggs, but real eggs for breakfast. Service is flawless with smiles and hello's from all the employees. Although Vegas can take all your money, in the end you take home an amazing time that will always want you to come back and visit the monies you left behind. I highly reccomend Harrah's Las Vegas for its value, location, and suprising upgrades you might get for a low price or free-99.

Check-in was painless and quick on a Saturday night. They had my reservation and the room was ready. The room was clean but rather spartan. The beds were clean and comfortable, the bathroom stocked but simple. The tv was a holdover from days of bell-bottoms and shag carpet but it worked. I didn't even know they still made giant 27\" Zenith tvs. My only real room complaint was the air conditioning. If I understand correctly, in order to conserve energy, the a/c goes into a standby mode when it doesn't detect motion in the room. I didn't notice any problem with this while sleeping, but when I would return to my room after being out for the day it was very stuffy. It didn't take long to cool off and lose the stale odor but my first whiff of the room after being on the casino floor wasn't a good one. My lower service rating is based on the lack of modern wireless internet in the rooms. $13/day for a (slow) wired connection is unacceptable in a modern hotel. The housekeeping staff were all very friendly as I passed them in the hallway and never disturbed me as long as my \"do not disturb\" sign was out. If they saw me leaving the room they would typically greet me and politely ask if I needed anything - towels, sheets, soap - which I found very inviting. Desk staff and cashiers were equally as polite even when delivering the canned \"Welcome\" responses. I would recommend the Spa to anyone interested. It's not the cheapest and most likely not the most luxurious, but it was well worth the visit. The Dueling Pianos in the the bar on the floor was a fun show and the burgers at KGB were certainly more than just palletable.

We checked in and got a king room in the Carnaval tower. Loved it! We could see the Mirage volcano and mountains from our hotel room! The room was very clean. It was a little smaller from the rooms in MGM where I have stayed twice, but it was still quite nice. Liked the fact that they have in-room safes as some of the hotels (Luxor, last year) don't have them. HATED the fact that I had to pay $35.00 for 3 days of internet, (booooo) also, did not like the TV. OK so I DO NOT expect a flat screen TV in all the rooms, got more to do than watch TV in Vegas, but it was and older picture tube thing and it was blurry - and the hotel should at least give you a TV channel guide. When you turn off the TV it resets to the Harrah's/Vegas channel. Had to hunt each night for our favourite channels that we thought we found the night before. Free cocktails were hit and miss at first. You have to find a good slot machine and plant yourself in one spot for the night. That is the way to meet the \"Right\" girl! On night 2 after spending $$ in the Essentials store buying our OWN drinks for the casino in disgust, we finally found a good waitress. With $1 tip per round and a good memory - she kept us happy for the duration of our trip as far as drinks go! LOL! Did not do the buffet offer (7 buffets in 24 hours). Not sure why, but for some reason we thought it was too expensive. By the time we decided we should have done the offer we were going home soon. We will do the buffet thing next time. Loved the free shuttle to RIO as we had a show to watch there (Penn and Teller) and it was totally convenient. Took the deuce \"Bus\" To Fremont Street, (You get it from the Flamingo, Margarita-ville) It was a cheaper way to travel and on the way home it drops you off at the Mirage which is just across the street.

So back I went, this time asked them to have someone from Plant Operations bring something to open - still could not do it. I asked for a refund, they said ok but only for one bottle of wine and one opener - REALLY? Of course I only wanted one, but it was very insulting and demeaning that they wanted to make that very clear to me. The staff gave me the feeling that I was bothering them.

One guy refused to put the prime rib on the grill but thanks to Teodoro, I was at least able to consume something worth the half hour wait Salvatore, you can go kick rocks, your attitude was HORRID! Most of the wait staff were friendly, but serving school cafeteria spaghetti at a buffet that costs $24.99 per person plus tax is a DEALBREAKER. Oh, and you guessed it, I couldn't use the crappy coupon that they gave me. I'd say to anyone planning a trip, do your research, a lot of the low budget hotels have better amenities than the hotels on the strip, and of course they're (strip hotels) collecting so much money that they could care less, but guess what, little things count when it comes to service, and charging people for refrigerators when the other hotels offer them for free is just bad business. Businesses aren't going out of business because of the recession, they're going out of business because most human beings are tired of paying money and being treated like garbage. Did I forget to mention the ancient televisions. I had to go to the sports bar down the street to watch the game because the tv is terrible. Oh, and HARRAH's if you don't remember anything else, remember this, customers only need one casino channel, not 3. Harrah's tv is not what I want to see when I turn on the television, get some real channels.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland TN", "Title": "\u201cChristmas 2010 Las Vegas Strip Harrah's\u201d", "Author": "WanderingWomanTN", "ReviewID": "UR90835024", "Content": "We flew in to Vegas for a romantic Christmas getaway. Almost everything was open for Christmas with the exception of the Carnival Court. You would never even know it was Christmas day there. Nothing shuts down. Diamond check in was a breeze and we were upgraded to a jr. suite on 27th of Carnival Tower. Huge room but bathroom was small and not one of the upgraded granite counter tops you may read about in the room descriptions. Room was very quiet and comfortable. It had a coffee pot, but I have read other reviews that they don't have them in most rooms. I had packed a little coffee pot that I got at a walgreens for $10 and brought my own coffee and condiments. The valet parking was as fast and smooth as it could be. For being Christmas, the streets were absolutely jam packed with people of all kinds. If this is your first time to vegas, BEWARE THE SLAPPERS! There are these peddler type people on the street trying to force hand bills into your hands. These people should be arrested. They block the flow of the already congested sidewalks and cause little bottle necks of chaos. IGNORE THEM, do not accept their junk and just keep walking. We took the Deuce down to Freemont Street and arrived with no problem, getting back to Harrahs was a joke. It is too far to walk but the bus was crawling in the really log jammed traffic. It was total gridlock. We finally gave up and got out and walked. Harrah's Flavors buffet is good, but their sister property Planet Hollywood has the Spice Market Buffet and it beats Flavors, but not by too much. Christmas day Dinner, oh my god, the lines (being a Total Rewards Diamond Player has its rewards). I felt so bad for all those people standing on line for hours! Literally. Diamond has its own private entrance and no wait (yes, I felt guilty, but not too guilty to eat-lol). Casino floor service was very good. Always had a cocktail waitress around when we wanted one and they never forget to come back as long as you tip them. The room was not the reason we came to Vegas, but I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the rooms that don't have the flat screen tvs are a little dated in many ways. The elevators are quite fast and the other guests did seem to respect the other guests. We hardly heard a sound from the hallway. A couple of tips I have learned from traveling a lot, take a safety pin to close the drapes better. Bring a small plug in night light for the bathroom to find your way in the dark, and bring a small extension cord to plug your phone chargers into so you don't have to fight to get to the plug behind the bed. Also, we used Tickets 4 Today located at the far end of the Casino Royale (next door to Harrahs\") The show tix are way discounted and a real bargain.

The concierge/box office was able to book all six shows that we wanted to see (even at other hotels) so that was very convenient. There was a Starbucks located right by the room elevators so that was a definite plus. First two days we ate breakfast at McDonalds right outside our hotel which saved us alot of money since any meals in Vegas can add up. Le Cafe in the hotel was a good place to eat breakfast also. Would also recommend the bar Numb if you like frozen drinks which were delicious. The Range Steakhouse was excellent so would definitely recommend eating dinner there. Went to the Improv and be sure to drink first because the comedians we saw were not very funny. We did see the Mac King show which I would recommend because he was very funny and entertaining. Also I would recommend Legends in Concert because some of the impersonators were so good.

We had 3 nights, Saturday to Tuesday, in what was supposed to be a Luxury room with a view of the Strip - according to the Expedia site I booked with, but our view was of the car park and the other wing, so I suspect the hotel put us in a Classic room. I didn't pick this up until I started to write this review, so it's my fault for not querying it with the hotel at the time. And to be honest, it's very true what everyone says - your room is definitely only a place to catch up on some sleep in between being amazed at all there is to see and do in Vegas, so the view doesn't really matter! Our room was clean and comfortable. One of the net curtains had started to come off it's track, which I though might have been noticed by housekeeping but that is a minor point. Not having tea or coffee making facilities in the room was inconvenient. Coming from New Zealand, this is the norm in hotels 'down-under' and we found it strange that we couldn't even request an electric jug from housekeeping - they simply don't have them. I guess it's all part of getting you to pay for as much as possible and may be standard in all Las Vegas hotels - don't know about that. The hotel is definitely one of the older properties, and can't match the glitz and glam of the newer hotels, but what it lacks in 'bells and whistle's', it makes up for with its location - right smack bang in the middle of all the action - across the road from Caesars and the Mirage. We loved Vegas - but 3 nts is definitely not long enough. Granted I had to slow my pace to match Mum's, but even if I had been able to race around at my usual pace, I think 5 nts is the minimum required, and a week would be great - especially if also wanting to visit the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam.

One has to step of for that experience. The service is decently good and reasonable. Harrahs has the entire ground floor as a casino, replete with all slot machines and poker tables. Nevada law does not allow minors (21 years and less) to gamble. So please have identity proof ready. Children, even accompanied by parents are not allowed near the tables and the staff ensures this. Other than this precaution, the casino is a great place to enjoy. The hotel also provides an anonymous service which can be set to control the amount of money played or gambled by a patron. Harrahs has a large multi-cuisine buffet restaurant called Buffet Of Buffets. Multicuisine is a slight understatement, as the hotel provides at least ten cuisines with around 20 dishes in each cuisine. The food is good but not out of this world. The buffet does live up to its name! From the number of shows hosted by the hotel, we saw the Mac King Comedy Show. The show host happened to complete 20 years of stagework that day. His tricks are good, falling on the 'cute' side but certainly not mediocre. These are supplemented by wisecracks and some gags. Its an engaging show for the family. The theatre has an attached bar, with no free drinks, unfortunately! Rita Rudner is another popular show, aimed primarily at couples. Our tour made a good choice of hotel. But a bulk booking may have reduced the prices. That said, for a general Las Vegas 3-day experience, Harrahs is a good hotel to stay in.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte", "Title": "\u201cDecent room with good location\u201d", "Author": "LauraPh", "ReviewID": "UR87939575", "Content": "I picked this hotel for it's location and price.

We ended up on the 14th floor on the Mardi Gras Tower in a \"luxury room with a view\". As others have noted, \"luxury\" must mean something else at Harrah's, but the room was nice enough. It was clean with a comfortable bed. We had a view of The Mirage so we could see the Lava show every hour. The curtains were thick enough to make the room nice and dark at night. We could not hear any outside noises. The hotel and casino were easy to navigate. The casino is not as glamorous as most of the others, but that's ok. We spent most of our time walking through all the grand hotels most of the day anyways. All the staff we met was nice... from the bartenders, waitresses, the dealers... it wasn't stuffy at all.

We asked for two rooms be right next to one another. Worked out well with having a door in between so my 1 year old twins could run around. they were also able to provide us with a crib.

I never realized how big the hotels really were in vegas until we walked from the front of the hotels (at the strip) to the very back to catch the monorail. Traveling with two kids, my husband and mother-in-laws it was a convenience for us when we had to get to the far end of the strip. We didn't eat at any of Harrah's restaurants. I can't say how the food was. We only frequented the Starbucks near the elevators. They do have a convenience store which came in handy when we needed to buy our twins some milk. They also have fresh fruit there you can buy. If you're there a good number of days you might be able to grab some ripe bananas that they put on sale. The staff and cleaning crew were all very nice.

Check-in: We arrived in the early evening - there were 4 folks in front of us and the line-up moved quickly. The interaction was pleasant and we were soon headed upstairs. 2. Room: We received the room I had requested when booking \u2013 two queen beds, non-smoking room, and a quiet location. Room 2943 overlooks part of the strip and we had a perfect view of the Mirage and their volcano which my daughter enjoyed watching each night. The room itself was clean, a nice size with a small table and two chairs by the window, and the beds were comfy with lots of pillows and puffy white comforters. We could hear folks around us once in a while (in the hallway or adjoining room) but overall the room was very quiet which was perfect for my teen who likes to sleep in whenever possible. I had booked a Luxury room through Expedia for $62.73 a night CAN (no resort fee) and it was well worth the minimal extra cost. There was also a coffee maker in the room which was a lovely to have in the mornings so I could have some caffeine while waiting for the teen to roll out. The A/C was hit and miss but when the room warmed up too much, we\u2019d just open the window and let in some fresh, cool air from outside. 3. Harrah\u2019s restaurants: We tried the Flavors buffet on our first morning in Vegas. The service was great \u2013 I was given a carafe of coffee and lots of creamers and my daughter\u2019s chocolate milk was good. The food itself was basic buffet breakfast fare and was tasty. There are two Starbucks in the hotel\u2013 the one on the main level was always open and I grabbed a few latte\u2019s from there during the week. On our last evening we treated ourselves to the from-scratch homemade ice cream at IcePan on the second level and it was delicious. We both tried the non-fat ice cream and it was excellent. 4. Room attendants: The ladies who worked on our floor were very nice \u2013 every time we saw them in the morning, they were smiling and pleasant and we exchanged a \u201cgood morning\u201d. Our room was kept clean and restocked as required. 5. Location: Excellent! So many great hotels are within walking distance \u2013 the Mirage, TI, Venetian, Caesar\u2019s Palace, Flamingo, Paris, Bally\u2019s, Bellagio, etc. The shows we\u2019d booked were all within walking distance \u2013 the only time we needed transportation was for shopping and the attractions that are farther down the strip. 6. Getting around: We were in Vegas to shop (and go to shows) so on Day 1 we each bought a $20 3-Day All Access bus Pass (Premium Service) that included the Deuce bus (goes up and down the strip) and the Gold Line bus (which goes to both outlet malls and Freemont). Excellent purchase for getting us to the locations that were outside of walking distance. We checked out the RTC website in advance and knew which bus stops were closest to Harrah\u2019s for each bus. We also ended up using the monorail twice because it was the quickest route to get us from Harrah\u2019s to MGM. It\u2019s nice to use but you have to walk all the way to the back of each hotel in order to use the monorail where the buses stop right out on the strip. The Deuce is the double-decker and it\u2019s a lot of fun to sit up top and check out the sites as you\u2019re traveling. And you will definitely use the bus pass if you\u2019re there for a few days and the Bellagio seems a lot further than it did on Day 1 because your feet are giving out on you. One warning though \u2013 the Deuce fills right up to capacity when Vegas is hopping and sometimes it can be hard to get on and it seems like forever (ie. 20 \u2013 30 minutes) until the next bus comes along. And the evenings can be cooooold - especially if it's windy. 7. Shows: We saw Mystere, Blue Man Group, and Terry Faytor and loved them all. We\u2019d go back to each one. Mystere wasn\u2019t full and one of the ushers asked us if we\u2019d like to sit in the front row \u2013 which of course we accepted. The show has lots of \u201cwow\u201d moments and is quite funny. Blue Man Group was also funny and we were in the 2nd row. The first 4 or 5 rows are poncho rows and we were happy to be sitting off to the side a bit as we didn\u2019t really need the poncho (although it was nice to have just in case as folks in the middle did need theirs). Terry Faytor has an excellent voice and we enjoyed the selection of music he used in his act. 8. Attractions: There is currently a deal where you can pay one price ($54 each) and you can pick three attractions to go and see. We chose the Titanic exhibit (Luxor), the Bodies exhibit (Luxor right beside the Titanic exhibit), and the CSI experience (MGM). The Titanic exhibit was amazing \u2013 it was goose-bump-raising to see items from the ship and the presentation was more than I expected with a walk through third class, the higher classes, the winding staircase, and information about the passengers. We thought the Bodies exhibit was very interesting but it\u2019s probably not for everyone as it is genuine cadavers that have been peeled and posed to show different parts of the body (ie. nervous system, muscle structure, bones, etc). The CSI Experience at MGM was a lot of fun \u2013 you get to choose 1 of 3 mysteries and have to search for the facts to solve your case. We used the monorail to get from Harrah\u2019s to MGM as the monorail stop at MGM is right next to the CSI Experience. We also went to Madame Tussaud\u2019s wax museum at the Venetian which was excellent as usual. We were going back and forth about whether we wanted to see it but then a gentleman out front gave us a coupon for $8 off of each of our tickets so we decided to go in. We didn\u2019t regret it as they\u2019ve added quite a few new wax figures since my last visit in 2008. 9. Other restaurants/buffets: Our favourite restaurant this trip was definitely the Rainforest Caf\u00e9 in MGM. This place is great for children and adults \u2013 great food/value plus there are animatronic animals that move around, lots of big fish, and a thunderstorm each hour. I had a burger and my daughter had a salad and both were excellent. Least favourite meal of the trip was the lunch buffet at the Luxor \u2013 the service was excellent but the food was cafeteria-style at best and wasn\u2019t very good. Favourite buffet that we tried was definitely the lunch buffet at Treasure Island.

We have stayed at Harrahs, Flamingo, Ballys, and Caesars - and enjoy al of them. The pools at Caesars and Flamingo are the best. The decor in Caesars is beautiful and the restaurants are outstanding.

Flamingo is always busy and looks a little worn but it is a fun place with a lot of action - and the connected Margaritaville bar is also fun. The updated Go rooms are very nice. Bally's is my least favorite as I don't like the long ramp to enter the casino but the Italian restaurant is good. You can't beat the location for any of these Harrah's properties.

My conference was at the Venetian Hotel, priced at $259 per night. Since I was staying for the whole week I decided to stay somewhere less expensive. I got a 'luxury room' for an average price of $80 per night. Check in was fine, there was a long line but I got in my room within 20 minutes, the person doing the checkin was very helpful and tried to accomodate a couple of things I requested, no luck on the requests but she did try. The luxury room (strip view) apparently hadn't been upgraded so they moved me into a room in the Mardis Gras tower which had a pool view but no strip view. The room was fine, clean and comfortable. I had an air conditioner issue the first night but it was immediately addressed. Later in the week I had a need for a roll away bed and extra towels, these were provided very quickly by a very pleasant gentleman. Very easy to get to the Venetian conference area from there, took me 10 minutes to walk it from my room to the conference center. I had breakfast in the restaurant, food and service was fine. Dinner one night in the gourmet hamburger place was not so good, I do not recommend the Captain Crunch milkshake, alright, I know I probably should have known better but the kid in me spoke loudly. The hamburger was overdone, all in all not a good meal. Gambling at the Casino... didn't really try it there as the smoke was really bad. Other casinos have done a much better job at removing the smoke and creating a pleasant gaming experience. Harrahs needs to do that. Most of the blackjack tables (all that I saw except single deck) were 6:5 payouts which I won't play, you have to work too hard to win (if it is possible to win). So outside a few slots that my wife played there we took our gambling somewhere else. Best places to gamble: Mandalay Bay and MGM, found $5 blackjack tables and played all day. Both places comp'd meals. Dealers were great. As a homebase to wander the strip, at an affordable price, Harrahs is a good value. I would stay there again. All in all great trip to Vegas, food comp'd where we gambled, great show, saw Beatles Love... hint, look for discount ticket codes on line and choose the cheap seats, best seats in the house, 2nd time I have seen the show and I will see it as often as I can.

The price and location, however, are tough to beat. Harrah's is right in the middle of the strip -- many other hotel casinos (including Caesar's Palace for those of you into sports gambling) are easily walkable -- and offers excellent value for the price. If you're in Vegas to be out and about, to party with friends, or even traveling for business (maybe attending one of the many conventions held in Vegas) on a budget, Harrah's is an excellent choice for a very reasonably priced bed.

Only real low point was our meal in the steakhouse in the hotel, The Range. While the quality of food was top notch the service we received from our waiter on the night was very very poor. As we had been to a show that evening we received vouchers for 50% off certain main course dishes in the resteraunt. Nonetheless we still paid around $110 for our meal. However from the moment we showed the voucher to the waiter it was clear he was not interested in providing a quality service to us, with the result he ignored my partner's original drink order and forgot to bring our side dishes with our main course.

My review is mixed. The not-so-good: 1. We had specifically asked for a quiet room near the elevator, both when we made our online reservation and at the time of check-in. The desk clerk looked right at us and assured us that it was a quiet room. The first disappointment was that it was not near the elevator, but rather towards the end of a long hallway. But more importantly, the room was extremely noisy. We were put on the 6th floor of the Carnival Tower and were overlooking a service road and dumpsters. There was continual noise from trucks. Furthermore, the air conditioners in the room were extremely noisy. Between this and the road noise, I had a very difficult time sleeping. I know that we could have asked for a change of room, but after unpacking for a week long stay, the thought of moving again was not appealing and we made the best of it. The part that was most disappointing was the fact of the desk clerk lying to us. 2. If you like to play blackjack and adhere to basic strategy with traditional rules, this will be a disappointing place to play. 99.9% of the tables had a 6/5 payoff for blackjack (this seems to be prevalent at all of the Harrah's properties we visited in Las Vegas). Toward the weekend, they opened up additional tables with 3/2 payoffs, but essentally we played at other casinos through the week and were not able to give Harrah's much play. The good: 1. For an older property, I thought that the hotel was reasonably well maintained (except for the air conditioning!). The room was extremely comfortable and a good size (we had upgraded to a petit suite) with a flat screen TV. The bathroom toiletries were Gilchrest and Soames and were higher end than I would have expected. 2. Location: You can't beat the centrality of this hotel. It's a great taking off point if you want to go either right or left or across the street with very easy and quick access to a dozen casinos.

Apparently as an energy saver the air conditioner kicks on when it senses motion in the room and cools quite nicely. As soon as we settled to sleep the room got stuffy and Hot HOT HOT. I would get up, walk around, and it would kick on again for a few minutes- just long enough for me to fall asleep. Needless to say this went on ALL night. Got up in the morning and went on with our day. Returned to the room, hot again, my husband called down within a half hour someone came and waved a magic wand over the thermostat and we were comfortable the rest of the night.

We were 5 couples in all. Check- In was a breeze, (we arrived at approx. 10:30 am and our rooms were ready). Our rooms were scattered between both the Carnival Tower and the Mardi Gras Tower. All of us were happy with our rooms. My boyfriend took a chance and requested a view of the strip and we received the keys for room 1556 in the Mardi Gras Tower. (See pictures). We were able to watch the erupting volcano at the Mirage from our window every night!! Some people have complained about the noisy hallways and thin walls however we didn't encounter any of these problems. On our last night however, our neighbors must have had one too many and woke us up when they were trying to get into our room at 3:00 am. We ate breakfast at the Flavours buffet at Harrah's and, although the food was not bad, it was very pricey, (about $33.00 for the two of us). Most days, we ate breakfast at the McDonalds nearby. The birthday celebration dinner was held at Harrah's in the Range Restaurant. Beautiful ambiance and all of our meals were tasty. The service was very good. The pool wasn't the nicest that we've enjoyed but it certainly did the job. It was nice that we were allowed to \"discreetly\" bring our own beverages to the pool. That saved us a lot of $$ as both the drinks and dinners were quite pricey. The choice of music played by the young DJ's failed to target the average age of the crowd. (On a few occasions, the average age was roughly 40-50 yrs and the young male DJ was playing heavy rap and some other \"noisy\" stuff). I approached him and made some requests and he was very accommodating. Harrah's has a perfect location - smack dab in the center of the strip. The staff is friendly and helpful and the Casino and rooms are kept very clean. We had a great time and shared many laughs and most importantly made a memorable 50th for a wonderful friend.

Yes, it is not a 'fancy' hotel, but I will say that the management keeps this hotel consistently clean & maintained. Many other hotels that age are already showing deferred maintenance. Our room in the Carnival tower was clean and comfortable. It was a good size with a table and chairs in a nook in the back. Bed was much more comfortable than some hotels I've been to lately. Bathroom was kept in good working order (i.e. no slow drains or drips) and no deferred maintenance (unlike some so-called 4 star hotels on the Strip...do you hear me Monte Carlo??). As far as sleep quality, there will always be drunk idiots walking by your room at 4am\u2026it\u2019s Vegas, just expect it, bring earplugs if you\u2019re a light sleeper and thank me later. But, I will say Harrah\u2019s seems to have thicker walls than some other mid-range Strip hotels. Food options are great at Harrah's too. The Buffet isn't super fancy, but the selection is great and the staff keeps things friendly and moving quickly. Also, you can't beat the Monorail station located right at the back of the hotel and the connection to the Imperial Place just steps away.

It got us a view of the pool/strip and a newly renovated room. I never saw the 'regular' rooms, but heard that they were very old/outdated. The room was clean and had plenty of room. The bed was decently comfortable, the pillows were not--flat as pancakes, but OK if you stacked 2 or so. The one complaint I do have about the room was how thin the walls are. The night before we left, we were in bed around 1:30am and I was not so happily awoken by our VERY loud neighbors around 4:30am which lasted for about an hour. It sounded like they were literally sitting on the bed with us they were so loud. The casino was comparable with all the others..lots of slots, gaming tables, and SMOKE! The service was fine. This is an older hotel, so keep in mind the casino is not as glamorous as many others. There is a beer/liquor store very close which is nice. If you are planning on drinking at the pool, definitely bring your own (even though they tell you not to, it seemed that as long as you were discrete, this was not a problem). You'll pay about 1/2 the price or more if you buy them from inside the hotel or at the liquor store around the corner. Overall, a good deal for the room/location.

I was immediately impressed. The room was a good size and the bathroom had two separate sinks/vanities and a jetted garden style tub. The pillow top mattress reminded me of home. We had a separate living area which we used to entertain friends. We traveled with a group of 18 and everyone else stayed across the street at The Mirage.

We got a sweet deal on the hotel room so we were not expecting much as the 5 nights cost us under $400 (US). We did request in our reservation that we have a king bed and a strip view room. They came through with the bed, however for the view, not so much. If you turned your head to the left and put it on a 45 degree angle with your left eye closed..... you catch my meaning! The rooms are dated, and ours was clean upon check-in with one exception - we found a towel in one of the dresser draws. Our rooms were cleaned daily with restocked towels and toiletries. The housekeeping staff don't remove anything from the room that is not in the garbage cans - so if you have an empty water bottle on your bedside table, it will still be there after the room is cleaned. Our room had a very easy to use safe, which gave us some peace of mind with regards to passports etc. Our A/C temperature did not move, despite trying to change it several times. In the end we gave up as it was acceptable at 69 degrees. The rooms do have a faint smell of tobacco, despite being in a non-smoking room, on a non-smoking floor! We had a TV in our room which was a very, very old CRT style and the picture was so bad, you could not have any lights on in the room if you wanted to watch it. We also had an iron and ironing board - which came in very handy. The power outlets are old and you need to watch it if you are charging items. The plugs sometimes partially fall out of the outlets and the batteries don't get charged! The remainder of the hotel was reasonably clean, even if a little dated. One thing about Harrahs is it's owned by Wyndham so be prepared if you stay here or any other hotel owned by Wyndham, you will be pestered by timeshare sales men. The first night we were there we were approached 7 times!!! There is a monorail stop at the back of the hotel which is perfect if you want to see other places on the strip - don't think you can walk from one end of the strip to another, you will never do it, there are too many people and disjointed walkways - it will take forever. Check in was fast - under 20 minutes and upon check in we were given books upon books of coupons - these do come in very handy so don't discard them. Check out was also quick and easy. There are no in-room coffee or tea facilities, as there are 2 Starbucks in the hotel which can make things very spendy. There are several restaurants in the hotel. We ate at Flavors buffet which was pretty average as well as KGB Burgers, which was reasonably priced and a little better than average. If you want a big meal at a very, very reasonable price, check out the Hash House A Go Go at the Imperial Palace. It's incredible. All in all, for what we paid, we were happy.

I really don't know how much of a difference this made to us as we did not use either feature, but still it was fun to brag- hey we have a tv in the bathroom. The room was clean and maid service did a good job each day. They do leave a little envelop for tips and at the end of our stay we did put a little money in there. Staff was friendly and check in and out went quickly. Staff was able to answer questions we had and quickly fix the one problem we had- one of the redemption machines ate a voucher without giving my boyfriend the money on it. We really didn't win money while playing slots here - maybe a few odd dollars, but wait staff did circle the machines and offer drinks even when we were playing on the penny slots. We ate at the buffet here twice (dinner and breakfast) and both times it was good. I highly recommend getting the buffet of buffet deal . you pay about 40 bucks and get unlimited access to several buffets for 24 hours. I know this may seem gluttonous but if you eat 4 meals (you do not have to overindulge) it is about 10 bucks a meal and in vegas that is a good deal. If you are a beer drinker and do not care about what kind of beer you drink - the place next door had dollar beers and also dollar margaritas if that is more your style. Not a far walk at all for cheap drinks. We did go to the pool one day for an hour or so. The pool is not much to look at and really pretty plain, so if you are wanting a place with a great pool you may want to go elsewhere, but this was no big deal for us.

The center-strip location was Harrah's best feature; although, every day and nite there were extremely seedy men and women handing out flyers \"girl for you in your room in 20 minutes\"! I didn't see these people in front of any other center Strip hotel, and wondered why Harrah's allows them there. All I could think of was first amendment right - tt was a public sidewalk. I considered complaining to the management, but blew it off. We spent our days hiking in Red Rock Canyon, Mt. Charleston, and even drove 2.5 hours to Zion National Park in Utah!

Why does every room have a mini fridge plugged in to refrigerate shaving creme? The carpet in our room had a huge stain between the beds, one in front of the dresser and along the bedside.

You had to close the door all the way to access the shower, but overall it\u2019s not a bad size. 2) internet access. Since I arrived on a normal work day, I needed to access the internet to get some things done before the weekend. Took me about an hour on the phone with their tech support to find out there was an issue with the in-room equipment. They dispatched a tech to fix the issue and it was done within an hour. Somebody had also disconnected all the cables and left it in a huge mess behind the desk. I was there with a group of about 20 friends and family for a wedding at another hotel.

The Hotel may not seem as huge and grand as it's neighbour; Caesars' Palace, but an attractive foyer and reception impressed us on first arrival. A swift check-in by a friendly and laid-back receptionist, then we easily found our rooms with the good sign-posts, and weren't looking around for ages like in some other big hotels. The rooms were great! Fantastic memory foam-like mattresses, soo soo comfy! Better than my own bed at home! We stayed in a Double Deluxe room, which my Fiance and I thought would have just one double bed in it, but wow we had two! one each!! spoilt! Coffee facilites, hairdrier and complimentary shower gel and soap, a flat screen tv and plenty of storage space made it a comfy retreat from the bustling busy strip. The Cafe at Harrahs' was our favourite choice for breakfast, my Fiance recommends the \"four aces and a kicker\" off the menu (hash browns, eggs, bacon, pancakes) with a big cup of coffee to start your day in Vegas. Handy tip for us British people, when asking for a cup of tea, ask for hot tea, as otherwise some places will serve you iced tea! Go to the piano bar one night at harrah's it was a good laugh. My Fiance and I ordered room service a few times and wow it was gorgeous food brought to us on a silver trolley with flowers and a butler! Fantastic service, what a treat! We ate one night in Bally's chinese restaurant - avoid. They don't serve alcohol in there for starters (?) and the food gave me and my family bad stomach's! Don't miss out on visiting Caesars Palace Colliseum shops, and eat at Planet Hollywood, the portions are huge but the food is sooo good! Lastly, don't miss out on the Bellagio fountains, soo romantic (that is where my Fiance proposed!!) and if on when you are visiting, go to the Titanic exhibition in the Luxor, and the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay. The only reason I would not give this hotel 5* is that the outside Carnival bar played very loud music until 3am every night, but hey it's vegas!", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time at Harrah's\u201d", "Author": "Samanta71", "ReviewID": "UR64857081", "Content": "I just got back today from a 4 day stay at Harrah's, from the time I arrived here until the time I got back home I was treated very well by everyone I came in contact with. Since I was traveling alone for the first time to Vegas I had asked the clerk at check in if I could have a room near the elevator. She upgraded me to a room in the Marti gras tower. I had a third floor room with easy access to the elevator. The room was neat and clean, not as big as some of the ones I've stayed in at other hotels but I didn't care. I didn't plan on spending alot of time in the room anyway. It had a nice flat panel tv in the main room and a small flat panel in the bathroom (I never turned it on) The slots were much better at Harrah's compared to the 8 near by casinos I checked out. The $1.00 blazing 7's were awesome, I had so much fun there, that was were I spent most of my slot play. I played enough on my winnings to be comped for most of my meals. I tried the buffet, was ok for breakfast but I didn't much care for the dinner buffet. The Range steakhouse was great, I enjoyed the blackened prime rib. I also ate breakfast at the Cafe, it was good and the lines weren't as long as the buffet lines. All the hotel employees were great, friendly, helpful., didn't have to look for the drink waitress. They came around regularly. I am a woman in my 50's and I decided to make this trip solo, I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but it was great! I felt safe the entire time I was there. I would recommend Harrah's to anyone looking for a good time in Vegas, and any other women out there that are thinking of traveling to Vegas alone but were unsure about it.

Our upgraded and remodeled room had stains on the carpet, a big crack in the tub and what looked like tread marks on the walls - maybe somebody was bored and trying to run up the walls? Who knows! Another fun part was that we were told we were in the Mardi Gras Tower BUT if you are in that tower on floors 5 or 6 they have a sign posted that you have to use the elevators for the other tower to get to your room.

Unfortunately one of the reasons we picked Harrah's over other similarly priced hotels in that vicinity is because we wanted a hotel with a pool, but their pool area was unappealing (feels run-down), strangely laid out (there wasn't much seating area near the pool itself, then a big \"sunning\" area away from the pool) and the music was REALLY annoying and loud. If you like loud thumping base, when you're relaxing by the pool then maybe you'll like it, but we sure didn't.

My adult children accompanied us along with another couple and their adult child. Two of the boys had recently turned 21 and the other boy is 25. My husband had promised them that we would go to Las Vegas when our youngest was 21. So we hooked up with another family with a son who had just turned 21 as well. In fact it was his birthday present! Some present it turned out to be! We arrived on Friday April 2, checked in to 3 rooms. One for each couple and one for the 3 boys. We did some sight seeing, ate dinner, went to see downtown Vegas. We came back about 9:30 pm. Myself and my older son went back to our respective rooms and to bed by 10pm. The other boys and fathers were down in the casino gambling. My husband and the other father came up to the rooms around midnight. They had just been with the boys checking on them before they came up. One of them was alone at a blackjack table with a pile of chips in front of him..Both boys had had a couple drinks but were not intoxicated. They came up to the rooms around 1 am. There were two other men in the elevator with them when they came up. (They didnt think anything of it at the time, and it is maybe significant, or maybe not.) My oldest son had been in the room sleeping since 10 pm. At 1:45 his alarm clock on his phone went off by mistake..he hadnt shut it off from back home.....All the boys woke up at that time. Then went back to sleep. When they woke up at 7 am the next morning, their wallets, and cell phones were GONE. Sometime between the alarm going off and 7 am when they woke up someone had entered their room. All 3 wallets and 2 of their cell phones had been stolen...one cell phone was on the floor and not visible. All their credit cards, cash and photo id's were gone. We notified hotel security, who came up to take the report....who told us this was rare. Dont believe you!!!! As the process moved along it became clear that they were not going to accept any liability in this matter and that they were blaming the boys for not using the deadbolt latch. They even went as far as to accuse them of leaving the door ajar. Which by the way is impossible even if you let the door shut from one inch away it closes securely and locks. They were asked why they didnt use the safe.....DUH Because they were IN THE ROOM!! About an hour and 1/2 later a security guard found 2 of the 3 wallets in a trash can on the first floor...of course emptied of the important stuff. Proof that someone had taken and disposed of them. We needed to file an official police report so that the boys could have proof that their id's had been stolen in order to get back on the plane to come home. We were then sent on a wild goose chase to a Las Vegas Police substation. It cost us $60 to get there and when we did IT WAS CLOSED!! Then we had to go to the airport to file the police report. Finally we found the police to make the report. The police there told us that this happened all the time. Hmmm I thought it was rare, according to Harrah's Another hour and half of our vacation wasted. By the time they were through with the reports we were all starving...soooo we ended up eating lunch in the airport of all places...just what I've always dreamed of. WOW what a great vacation. The hotel did not offer to comp the boys room or offer us a free meal or anything. We insisted that they move them out of that room and they did do that much. We were given phone numbers to call when we got home and led to believe that there was going to be an investigation and a detailed report. We have tried to call several times and Security tells us to cal Risk Management and vice versa. The hotel manager was no help either. Every one is passing the buck, That is what is most disturbing!! This was Felony Theft not to mention an unauthorized person in our childrens room. What if they had been hurt? Wow it all just gives me the creeps!!!

Best things to say were clean and comfortable room in a good location. Many other hotels/casinos in walking distance. Worst thing to say was 35 minutes to check-in; NASCAR weekend but only 4 people behind desk to check you in on Thursday afternoon. I was in Vegas for NASCAR weekend (Thurs Feb 25 thru Sun Feb 28). I was offered three free nights from many of the Harrah\u2019s properties and selected Harrahs since I never stayed at this hotel before. NASCAR weekend is one of the top 5 busiest weekends in Vegas. I arrive to Harrahs and there is a long line of people waiting to be checked in. I had to wait 35 minutes in line for one of the 4 check-in receptionists. Why only 4 people behind the counter on one of the busiest weekend, I just do not know. Luckily the couple behind me was NASCAR fans (in fact most all people in the line were) and we struck up a conversation so the 35 minutes was not too painful. I took the elevator to floor 6 and then to my room. The room was a standard with two beds, tube TV, small table with two chairs. The bathroom was pretty generic, tub/shower combo, that needed some updating. Overall, nothing to complain about the room; I just want a clean and comfortable room to throw my bag down, sleep and take a shower. Maid service was good and there was a safe in the room that did not charge a usage fee (as does Bally\u2019s). I used the express check-out and had no unexpected room charges. The casino was okay. They have 14 foot craps tables (did not see any minimum lower than $10; always 3-4-5 x odds) and some blackjack tables paid 3:2 on blackjack. I did not play any slots since I do not care for slots but mostly I have read that Harrah\u2019s slots are really tight.

They travel to Las Vegas at least once a year and our rooms were comped on their Total Rewards accounts so I can't really comment on the price of the rooms as we didn't pay for them. We had the basic room level in the Carnival tower which was perfect. Our view was of the Mardi Gras Tower and The Mirage. You could also see Treasure Island and the Venetian off to the side. It was clean and the beds were comfortable. We weren't fans of the pillows so if that's important to you you might want to consider bringing your own. They were feather pillows and got very flat when you put your head on them I prefer more support than that but my brother in law loves them and that's part of why they keep going back to Harrah's. It's sort of a personal preference thing but thought I would mention it. The only other thing I'll mention and by no means did this ruin our trip but while we rarely heard anything coming from the hallway or other rooms the noise coming from the windows was surprisingly loud. It's almost like they spent a lot of money on soundproofing the rooms but put in windows that aren't soundproofed at all. For example we were on the 12th floor but could hear people talking down below and one morning woke up to a semi backing up...beep beep beep at about 5 a.m. My brother in law's room however looked over the pool and Carnival Court and they could hear music bumping until about 4 a.m. so I am not complaining about the street noise at all. If you are a very light sleeper or this will bother you you might want to take ear plugs or do some research on a room that would be the quietest and request it. Otherwise the hotel was great with a perfect location right in the middle of the strip across the street from Caesar's Palace. We ate in the Cafe in Harrahs once and the food was good - not amazing but good. We also ate dinner at The Range one night and that was amazing. Very good food - great steaks. I had the wedge salad and the Peking Duck Confit from the appetizer menu and it was delicious and the perfect amount of food. My husband had the filet and it was cooked to perfection and so tender you could cut it with a butter knife. It is a little pricey but still worth it in my opinion. We also ordered room service for breakfast one morning and that was very good as well but pretty expensive but that's to be expected for room service. We aren't big gamblers but I played some slots and my husband played a little blackjack. We both won a little money but neither of us played enough to get anything comped. We ended up in the dueling piano bar one night. I'm not sure if it was late enough that they stopped charging a cover (we got there about midnight) or if they didn't charge that particular night but we paid no cover to get in. It was very entertaining but if you are sensitive about dirty or \"adult\" jokes you might not find it entertaining.

After talking to several others about where to stay we were convinced that Harrah's was the best location and hotel for our vacation. We stayed 3 nights and all were good except for the last night. We left our room at 9:30 am and returned back at 10:15 pm only to find out that our shower had been torn apart and was laying all over the bathroom floor. We received no notice and were in shock to discover this. We contacted hotel staff and they informed us that they were unaware of this issue and wanted to relocate us to another room. By this time it was approaching 11pm, I requested that they return the shower to its working condition and that we would prefer not to move to another room as we had to catch a 6am shuttle to the airport. After waiting approx 30 minutes we were told that the only option was to move to another room in another tower. I requested to be refunded for the room for the night, the staff informed me that there was nothing that they could do as the room was booked through Expedia?????? Expedia did not tear apart our shower. We ended up moving to another room at 12:15am and somehow managed to catch our 6am shuttle.

I can't speak of the others in our party, but I got the impression they too were not impressed. The food tasted old and often was barely warm. Yuck. We ate there only for convience. Toby Keith's Bar and Grill. Not for us. Way too loud. You cannot even speak to the person sitting next to you.

We were told by the hotel that the adjoining McDonalds was closed (it wasn't) but their hotel cafe is open 24 hrs. So we head to the cafe only to find it closed. So we had to go up to Toby Keiths..were they were serving cafe food. The menu was very limited at that time, and it was so incredibly loud it wasn't enjoyable at all. Drink service at this hotel was outstanding. The best we found. Machines were often tight but we all did win some money (which we promptly played back). Dealers were friendly too.

Easy walk to Venetian (hit the Mex place for happy hour margaritas/snacks) and right across the street from Caesar's forum shops.

Harrah's casino is just okay--we spent more time at the Flamingo where the drinks were steady and our luck was better! (Harrah's could definitely have better floor service for beverages.) Toby's bar was expensive and the bartender was rude/arrogant, but the cover band was pretty good. The outdoor bar (not owned by Harrah's I don't think) was happening, the bartenders were entertaining, it was pricey, and the band we thought was so very awesome turned out to be piping in the \"real\" band and lip syncing! We felt silly when we finally figured that one out at least an hour into it....even a bit \"betrayed\" :)! The Asian restaurant was delicious and the service was great. We ordered room service once and it was fast, plentiful, and tasted good. The diner type restaurant was good for breakfast...easily split the entrees for a very satisfying breakfast and more economical meal. We did NOT enjoy our \"Thanksgiving Special Dinner\"...turkey was terrible! We did pay $50 more a night to ungrade to a suite--absolutely NO regrets! The suite was large, had a beautiful view of the Rio/mountains from one window, and the \"happenings\" on the street below from another. With the bedroom separate, I heard very little from the hallway and slept really well--the covers could have been a lot (or even a little!) plusher...very thin! I have to say: Read the fine print on the \"mini-bar!\" If you pick something up to take a look at what it is and then put it back, you may have just bought it! (Had to call down to housekeeping and the front desk to check that there wasn't a charge--I was in my parent's suite and said \"What is this? We don't have one of these!\" It was an \"Intimacy Kit\"! We got a good laugh, but they didn't want the charge on their bill all the same!) Also, it was strange that we had a refrigerator and sink, but no microwave--I guess they want you to get out and eat all meals and not keep leftovers (kept my salad from our room service and it froze...).

We had the buffet one night at the hotel - arrive early to avoid the lines. It was EXCELLENT food and service-used the coupon from check-in. There is a tram stop at Harrah's, as well as free shuttles to a few different places like the Rio - love the free show in the sky. Additionally Harrah's is well situated mid-strip and many budget conscious amenities such as Walgreens, McDonald's, Burger King and Chipotle are within close walking distance - 5 to 10 minute walk. There are also some awesome cuisine nearby! We had plans to go to some of the \"hot\" nightclubs, but after the first night we spent singing karaoke with Frank Sinatra in the Piano Bar and then staying to watch the Dueling Pianos, which is cover free - we changed our minds. We also enjoyed the bands at Carnaval Court - right outside the door of Harrah's - and the bar staff's cool show - think the movie \"Cockitail\" with fire throwing added in. It also had no cover charge. I don't think we could have had any more fun anywhere else! We also got tickets to be contestants on the tv game show \"Let's Make A Deal\" filmed at the Tropicana. Tickets are free through CBS.com, but they give more tickets awan than there are seats, so the line to get in is first come first serve.

Our Deluxe room met our expectations, was very clean & quiet. The majority of our days booked were comped and we love its locations so this wasn't too hard to accept. The room was equipped with a coffee machine which was nice but the fridge is nothing but a pain and a ripoff. Do not open and try to put anything you bought inside it as you will be charged. I just wish they'd leave the thing empty for your use like they do at the Flamingo. Personally we can't comment too much on the casino as we like to play elsewhere for the most part. I do find that they have too many dollar slot machines as I prefer the quarter games (when I'm willing to throw away a couple bucks!) We played in their poker room but find the atmosphere dry & stale. The dealers seem to be rather unhappy for some reason, they don't talk nor smile - not even when you tip them! We never found any table games under 10 dollars so again we took our money elsewhere to try our luck. They have this litttle spot tucked in between the poker room and the sports book where you can get some grub. The sandwiches there are amazing, made to order and mmm mmm good. Another night we tried Toby Keiths bar & grill and enjoyed our selections - again no complaints. We opted one morning to have breakfast in the cafe, personally I found this a little overpriced as there are many other places we could have gone but stayed there due to its convenience. The buffet was pretty good but if we didn't have comps to use I'm not sure we would have dined there. Being that they had tons of food out and that they weren't overly busy made me wonder what they did with the food at the end of the night......things that make you go hmmmmm. How many different dishes can you make with leftover pasta night after night?? We made use of the gym and spa which was a nice break. It was nothing fancy but had all the ammenities we required. We went from 4 - 7 and it only cost us $5.00 being we hold Platinum players cards - sweet! The staff in the spa are extremely friendly and constantly asked if we needed anything - thank you.

The TV was fairly old and the toilet sometimes didn't stop running, but other than that no complaints. The Flavors buffet was great for breakfast, though I can honestly say I've never seen a breakfast buffet with cotton candy before. The Harrah's Cafe was only average.

The biggest plus was that I never had to wait on an elevator to get to/from my room. The onsite Starbucks was great. The cafe served huge portions although a little pricey except for the midnight to 6am steak and eggs breakfast special. YUM! Flavors buffet was sufficient but also a little pricey in my opinion. We did take advantage of the free shuttle to the Rio and then took a cab over to the Palms. A Harrah's employee told us to do that to save some money due to the traffic on the Strip. It probably saved a few bucks but next time I'll just go ahead and cab it because it took about 20 extra minutes. One evening the alarm clock in the room next to us was going off and I called the front desk to have them shut it off. They were polite and took care of it within five minutes.

Bathroom was good but the shower had a poor design and after i showered there was water all over the bathroom floor and into the entryway. I called front desk and asked for either housekeeping or maintenance to help with the spill. I will say that the response was very quick and someone knocked on the door in less than 5 minutes. When he entered he had the nerve to tell me it was MY FAULT. Even if it was,which I dont believe it was, a maintenance man should never tell a guest that they were wrong. He tried to tell me that I didnt have the shower curtain inside the tub, that he had worked there for 12 years and had seen this many many times. Well hello, youve seen it many times because of the design flaw,not the mistake of the guest. You see the tub has at the back of it a flat spot of about 18 to 24 inches at the height of the tub top. Dead space,why they have it I dont know. Perhaps to sit down? Any way I had booked two nights and we decided on the second night to stay for another night. I went to the Front desk and asked for another night. She told me I could stay but the price was double that of what i had paid. I told her that I had an email that I originally used for the reservation,that i had saved and could still get that original rate. She told me not so nicely,but not rudely to go ahead. I asked why if I was already a guest she couldnt just give me that rate for one more night,but said she couldnt. I then told her that I probably would go on the internet and book elsewhere. She then told me that this was a three star hotel and I probably would not get a rate like that. I booked elsewhere and the rest of our trip was very enjoyable.

This was a combination \"delayed 10th anniversary/sons 17th birthday/need to get away fr a few days\" trip to Vegas, timed to coincide with the National Finals Rodeo. I had originally booked us at The Orleans (based upon reviews on TA), but switched over to Harrah's because of friends who were meeting us who had booked through one of the gambling packages which required them to stay at Harrah's. I booked online, and decided to \"splurge\" a little for one of the newer, upgraded rooms in the Mardi gras tower. When we checked in (about 6:00 in the evening) and got to the room, we immediately knew that the room they had given us wasn't gonna work. The music coming up from the street (the Strip) was so loud in rattled the walls. Called the front desk, was told the music quit at about 2 a.m., but they moved us across the hall with no problems and it was fine----couldn't hear a thing. The rooms are nice, clean, expansive as regular hotel rooms go, and the beds were really comfortable. So, all in all, I'm pleased at this point. Now, the few negative points. First, our nice, luxurious 40 something inch flat screen TV quit after the first night. When I discovered this (Friday evening) I called down, and a maintenance man came right up. After poking and prodding, he decided he couldn't fix it, so he told me to \"take it up with the front desk\". Upon calling down, we were told the only thing they could do was move us to another room. Now, I don't know how everybody else does it, but my wife is one of those who has to unpack her entire suitcase and put everything in drawers as soon as she get into a room, especially if were going to be there for a few days. When I relayed that the only way we could get a TV was to pack everything up and move to another room, she reached for her book, so I had the answer to that question. In that it was late on Friday afternoon/evening, decided to just live without it and maybe something could be done the next day (Saturday). After being out of the room most of the day Saturday, we came back to the room and found that someone had been in messing with the TV again, but still no working TV. Message lights blinking, call down and get told \"We cant fix your TV, if you want we can move you to another room\". We're tired, kinda cranky, and just want to relax, so moving to another room wasn't going to work for any of us. Here's my question. If they can move us to another empty room which (apparently) has a working TV, why couldn't they simply bring a TV from one of those rooms and replace the one in our room? While it meant a little more work for the hotel, it wold have been a greta thing for us. I suggested this ot the desk, they said they would look into it and get back to us, never heard from them again. SO, consequently, 3 of the 4 nights we were there, \"sans TV\". As I said, no big deal, but they do advertise and sell these new, upgraded rooms with having these new, big, flat screen TV's (which I assume means they think they can charge more for them), so it would have been nice if they could have gotten us one. Or at least adjusted our bill to reflect the lack of this amenity, which didn't happen either. On to the next complaint. Remember I said I had booked my room online, and paid more to get the \"upgraded\" Mardi gras tower room? and remember I said that the reason we were at Harrahs at all was because our friends had booked one off those cheap, \"fly and stay\" Vegas deals which (usually) means you stay in one of the less expensive, lower quality rooms, right? Guess who was 2 doors down from our \"Upgraded, pay us more but you get more (like big screen TV's) \" room? Yep, our \"going to Vegas on the cheap because were not gonna be in the room long anyhow\" friends!! WTF!!!! I asked him if he upgraded, answer back, \"Nope, this is the room they gave us\". Only difference between theirs and ours was that they paid $40.00 a night less, and had a working, 40 something inch flat screen TV! Final complaint. Gawd I hate these \"charge extra for internet\" hotels. Even when I am gone for vacation, I have to stay connected to the office back at home, and at Harrahs the only way you do that is pay $12 a day. Come on, that ought to be part of standard service now, it is (almost) 2010. Welcome to 21st, age of the internet, century, Harrah's!! Anyhow, we did have a good time, the hotel staff are friendly and really accommodating, the rooms are more than adequate, and it is well located. Not saying I wouldn't stay there again, or that I wouldn't recommend this to someone, but I'd have to think about it real hard before I did.

RIGHT in the center of the Strip, with easy access to everything. I had read reviews about Harrah's and wasn't too confident going in, but my husband and I were pleasantlly suprised. The hotel lobby/casino part itself is really nothing to write home about, but the room was very comfortable and spacious, and had little amenities it's sister hotel next door (The Flamingo) doesn't, like a mini-fridge! Parking, check-in, and the walk to the hotel room were easy and uneventful. We did not get the King room we requested, but on well, that has happened to us in Vegas more than one time (and we're always there within an hour of check-in time everywhere, so I can't understand why that always happens to us). When we got to our room we were planning on just throwing our stuff in and running back out, but we spent a little extra time checking out the room because we were impressed at how comfortable it was. The bed was GREAT, very comfortable. Eventhough it was a Queen it felt bigger, seriously. When you exit the casino you enter a little courtyard area with shopping kiosks and little places to eat, so that's neat. It's situated right between the Imperial Palace and Harrah's and is crowded because pretty much everyone has to walk through it on their way down/up the Strip. There is also an area set up to eat/drink and watch some live entertainment, which was cool. We stood around for a bit and watched a 70's cover band sing and have some fun with an audience member on stage. They have a pool, but it's nothing to write home about either. It was November when we went, so using the pool was not an option for us, so I cannot attest for the pool \"ambiance\" or anything like that. If you want to see an awesome pool, go next door to it's sister property, the Flamingo! Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for your average 3-star hotel experience.

Room: Clean, comfortable, had obviously been remodeled/upgraded fairly recently. Was very clean, beds very comfortable, TV was plain, but worked fine. Bathroom was very clean. Elevators to room (21st floor) were commendably quick and reliable. Room was on the 'backside\" of the strip, so view was of parking garage 15 stories below, and out over the expanse of Vegas and of towards the mountains. Strip view would have been nice, but the view we had was actually quite fine. As a bonus, I rented a car, parked it on the garage roof, could keep an eye on it very easily, just in case. Casino: There are nicer casinos nearby, but, really, it was OK. Drink service prompt and friendly, easy to find your way around the casino, and to your room elevator. (most Vegas casino floors are very confusing, and easy to get lost/disoriented in, at least for me) Other amenities: Well, except for the Mac King comedy/magic show (which was Great!), didn't really take advantage of any of the casino food/health club ,etc, as most meals were provided as part of my business meeting. But, if you want to save money or are in a hurry, there is a McDonalds and a Denny's right to the North of the building, as well as a Subway in the Casino Royal Next door. Other thoughts: Right on the center strip, convenient to just about everything the strip has to offer. Maid service was some of the nicest and most responsive of any I have ever had in Vegas. Stayed at the Flamingo last time in Vegas, and that was OK, too. But, Harrah's is better. Rooms are nicer and newer, service is better, and Casino floor is less confusing.

My friend's parent provided us with a free stay, which was one of the best gift ever! Harrah's owns hotel/casino across the U.S., and many in Las Vegas such as Ceasar's Palace, Flamingo, and Paris Las Vegas. The Harrah's hotel is in a fabolous location on the strip next to the Venetian and across the street from the Forum Shops at Ceasars. Harrah's offers two towers and the one we stayed was nearer to the Strip. However, the room we stayed in had a view of the back of the strip overlooking the parking garage for the Venetian. Our room was comfortable and clean, which is all you need in Las Vegas, a place to sleep. We were able to fit up to five people in the room with two double beds. The bathroom and linens were clean. There were now rowdy people in the hallways so the sleeping quarters were very quiet. I didn't personally try the buffet, but my friends ate the breakfast buffet and said it was amazing. However, if you come into Las Vegas late at night do not take the $5.99 steak and eggs offer. My friends and I was not too happy after eating it at the small restaurant downstairs at Harrah's. The monorail stops in the back of the hotel near a bridge the connects both Harrah's and Imperial Palace next door. This monorail can take as far north as the Sahara hotel and down to the last stop at the MGM Grand hotel. My take in the monorail is that a day pass was a waste since we walked on the strip most of the time. If you are in a group, I would suggest riding the cab instead of paying for the monorail. We literally only used the day pass for one ride to the MGM and walked to strip back to Harrah's. I had fun gambling, but lost most of it at Harrah's. The issue I had with the casino in this hotel was that it felt stuffy and enjoyed to more open space the Venetian and New York New York offered to gamblers. I have checked the Mirage and Treasurer Island and remembered it being kind of dark in the casino floor. However, there is this hole in the wall casino next to Harrah's that my friend won big and the minimum bets are smaller than the hotel casinos. I would reccomend Harrah to other travelers because you can't beat the location where it is walkable up and down the strip and nearby major shopping at the Venetian, Forum, Wynn, and Fashion Show Mall.

However, one of the couples's rooms was ready. The 2nd couple's room was not ready as well. We all requested King Rooms. But when the 2nd couple went to check on the status of their room an hour later, their room was ready. When I checked an hour later, our room was not ready. We continued to check every hour, only to be told that our room was not ready. No one ever offerred to search for a different King room for us. They only kept offering a room with 2 doubles, which we did not want. At 4m, which is supposed to be check-in time, when we checked on the status of our room, we were told it was not ready. My husband asked to speak to a manager, and we were told check in is from 4 pm - 6pm, and a manager would not even speak to us until after 6pm. The clerk was very rude to him. Finally at 5:55pm, our room was ready, 6 1/2 hours after we arrived. Once we got into the room we discovered that the light was out in the entrance area of our room. Also our deadbolt did not work. We notified the hotel every day that we were there, and they never fixed either problem. Overall, we were very disappointed in the hotel this trip.

There is a monorail station right above the lobby, which was wonderful (the stations at MGM and Bally's were LONG walks from the road). All rooms we saw were very clean and tidy, and housekeeping did a good job. The front desk was quick and efficient, getting through long check in lines faster than other hotels we have stayed at. The Carnival Court bar was loads of fun, with bartenders doing bottle tricks and live music (also outdoor blackjack tables), and the Poker Room was nice. The Bad: We were booked into a regular room, so we paid a $35 a night upgrade to a \"minisuite\". Apparently \"minisuite\" means that the room has 2 phones and a coffee maker in the bathroom, but is otherwise EXACTLY like a regular room! Don't bother paying to upgrade!\u00a0 We found all of the food choices lacking, even the \"newly remodeled buffet\", however that was easily remedied with the short walk across the street to the Mirage, which had great food. The Harrah's Sunday breakfast buffet changed over to lunch at 9:45 am, since when is that lunch time?? The pool in a word: Terrible. The actual pool is tiny and freezing, so don't bother trying to swim. How could a pool in the desert be cold? Because its completely in the shade ALL DAY. If you want to catch sun you have to walk up stairs from the pool and sit on the \"sun deck\", or as normal people refer to it as: the roof. The most annoying thing by far was the room temperature. They use energy efficient motion detectors on the thermostat, so the AC doesn't kick on if you're not in the room. Unfortunately the wall the unit was mounted on is angled away from the bed, so when you are sleeping the AC never kicks on! Two nights we had to get up in the middle of the night and dance around the other side of the room to get the temperature to a reasonable level. For young people that have never been to Vegas, think twice about Harrah's, or anywhere on the North Strip for that matter. Our group of just under 30's was easily the minority, and the same looked true for all of the surrounding properties besides The Mirage. As an example, we sat down for drinks at the piano bar during karaoke hour, just as \"High Ho Silver, Away\" started being sung. No thanks.

Having been to Vegas before I knew Harrahs is at the bottom end of the food chain so my expectations were dismal prior to arrival but it was not as dire an experience as I had braced myself for. There are 2 towers of rooms at Harrahs. The Mardis Gras and the Carnaval. On arrival at 5PM we were informed our room was not ready - this seems to be a common theme for this hotel based on other reviews. After dinner and some lounging around we finally got our room at 7.30PM - not a good start and the front desk staff were rather indifferent to their customers first impressions. The room was in the Mardis Gras Tower and was small, dark, depressing and had a connecting door to the room next door that was occupied. The bathroom was also small and dark. After 3 nights in this room we moved to the Carnaval tower after being peristant in our complints of noise. I would equate the Mardi Gras tower room to a Motel 6 style room. The Carnaval tower has beeen somewhat refurbished and the room was slightly larger. Bathroom, lighting etc was similar to the previous room. TV's are from the 1980's with poor channel choice and picture quality. The room was only marginally quieter. You can hear your neighbours activities quite easily, toilets flush with an immense \"woosh\", doors slam easily and if it is a room within 20 yards of yours it is akin to a gun shot if the person is inconsiderate (and let's face it most people are). So in the 10 nights we did not get one uninterrupted nights sleep. I would equate these rooms to an older Hampton Inn. Internet is charged and is not exactly lighning fast. We ate dinner in the oyster bar (mediocre food) once and had breakfast in the cafe. Breakfast quality was reasonable but not cheap - average $20/head (including tax and tip) for a fairly basic offering. There is ALWAYS a wait for a table for breakfast yet the restaurant was always half empty - strange. Valet parking is fairly efficient but you naviagte ridiculous speed bumps to get in and enter through a smelly back part of the hotel. The other guests in this hotel were mainly elderly and obviously on a strict budget. Walkers, riding carts etc were common and the vast majority of them smoked. The smell of cigarette smoke permeates this building and everything in it - nasty. The casino has low ceilings, feels cramped and slots/tables are almost shoe horned in next to one another. If you don't smoke you soon will be in this casino - again nasty. Our room service was reasonabley prompt and the room was fairly clean, carpets did feel a little nasty though. Shower water escapes the tub easily and volume is low. There is a safe in the room and we used it or anything valuable. Basically this is a bottom feeder hotel and casino and is only saved by it's location and an apparantly loyal but aging clientel. If you are over 50, on a budget, smoke 40 a day and have the dress sense of Archie Bunker - this is the place for you.

I was given a room in the Mardi Gras tower. Standard un renovated room.....and it was fine. This is a 3 star hotel and I know what to expect, so no disappointments or surprises. The rooms are around 350sq/ft.....which to me as a solo traveller is ample. The furnishings are of sound quality and the bed was very comfortable. The linens were not scratchy and the towels were fluffy and clean. The bathroom though small was spotlessly clean. The television was the old crt type and the stations were limited. The thing I love about staying at Harrah's....and the reason I chose it over Caesars or Paris, even on a comped stay, are the staff! Just fantastic. I love how the staff are willing to help and are friendly. The poker room staff are brilliant and run a top quality show. The tournaments are fun, and the new deep stack tourneys are incredible value for money. The cocktail waitresses at Harrah's are honestly apreciative of a tip, remember your drink and it's always service with a smile. Harrah's location is pretty hard to beat, slap bang in the middle of all the action. Carnival Court is a blast that slowly kicks off after lunch and parties until the weeeee hours of the morning. The restaurants are reasonably priced, the atmosphere is fun, the staff are friendly, the customers all seem to be repeat stayers, the buffet is yummy, the rooms are comfortable, there is Starbucks, the location is unbeatable....there are just so many things to like about Harrah's.... if they were ever having a bad day....it's pretty easy for them to be forgiven....like when I checked in. Would I stay at Harrah's again?...You bet! Would I recommend it to friends, family and fellow travellers?...Yes, if they were looking for a brilliant location at a reasonable price with friendly staff. Is it a luxury hotel...No, but it doesn't pretend to be.

Our group stayed in both Mardi Gras and Carvanal Towers. The rooms were very clean, the beds were comfortable, but our alarm clock did not work. We stayed in a standard room and the decor was slightly modernized but needed TV upgrades, etc. The housekeeping staff was friendly, they did not knock on your door at 9:00 am wanting to clean them and did a nice job when they were through. The bartenders were cool and talkactive and the drinks were reasonable. Carnival Court is constant action, the bartenders put on a show.

It is not a value motel, but it is also not a posh resort. If you you are looking for a more standout, upscale experience, then you would not like Harrah's.

We spent most of our time out and about so the only time we were in the room was to sleep. As most say - you get what you pay for.

Looking back, I didn't think the Harrahs was smokier (meaning a lot of smoke floating around) than most. I think what it was is that it has a heavy smoke smell due to poor ventilation, perhaps? Outside of that it is the same as most other hotels. We thought their buffet was OK - we had coupons so that helped with cost. We at their Cafe' restaurtant and I thought for the price we had paid for 2 breakfast entrees - we would've found more value at the buffet but couldn't go there because it was after breakfast hours and we wanted breakfast.

The check-in clerk was unable to give me the \"Deluxe\" room type because the smoking rooms in this category are only on the 3rd floor, with no view--and I always like a high-floor with a view! So I accepted a regular room on the 25th floor of the Carnival tower with a nice view of the Mirage and the exploding volcano! I got my view! The room was decently furnished and had everything I needed for my stay. The weird thing (that I had previously heard from other reviewers) is that the HVAC system is motion-activated. When you are not in the room, it doesn't cool down. It begins when you enter the room, but because of this setup, it never seemed to get as cool as I wanted it. The location is perfect! Right on the strip, with easy access to Imperial Palace, Flamingo, Caesars, Mirage, Treasure Island and the Venetian. The monorail is steps from the back of the property. Also, shuttles to various off-strip properties are in back by the valet/shuttle area. Very convenient! I used the spa 2 different days, and went after 4:00 pm when the price drops from $25 per day to only $10. I also sat out at the pool 2 days, although the pool deck is very small and doesn't accommodate a lot of chairs, so I had to sit up at the \"over-flow\" area. This wasn't too bad, although I would have rather have sat with a view of the pool. Very frequent drink service, though! I only ate at one restaurant, which was the Flavors buffet for breakfast one morning. Good food, and I was able to use a $5 off coupon that they hand out in the Carnival Court area. I also got coffee each morning at one of the 2 Starbucks coffee locations right outside the Carnival elevators, or at the 24-hour McDonalds right next door to Harrahs on the strip. Gambling was not real kind to me until just before I left when I hit for $450 on a .25 cent machine.

We asked for an upgrade to a Deluxe Suite but they wanted $75 per night and we would have to move to another room on the weekend so it wasn't worth it. The room is really small. I think it's good for one person. You cannot share the bathroom because the mirror is made for a single person. Also, the TV in the bathroom is good if you are sitting on the toilet. I didn't use it. I thought when people mentioned the TV in the bathroom, it was the kind that is IN the mirror but I was wrong. The tub was dirty so we asked housekeeping to clean it again. The tub and sink would not drain properly so we asked maintenance to fix it three days in a roll before it finally worked properly. Maintenance were nice and showed up quickly but I want things fixed the first time around. Housekeeping should have noticed when she was cleaning which gives you an idea of how well they clean...This room had a view of the Mirage Volcano and you can hear the music even with the balcony door was closed. It didn't bother us because we weren't sleeping during that time. The room was pretty quiet although you can hear the toilet flushing next door. The side table moved in circles but the granite is not secured so just be careful. The location is awesome. There's a McDonald's next door for cheap quick eats. We ate at Mings Table and the Cafe at Harrahs which are both mediocre food. I'd rather go eat at other places and highly recommend Mesa Grill at Caesars and San Marco at Venetian. We took the monorail and walked everywhere. Cabs were readily available and there is a free shuttle to the Rio. Going there is usually not a problem but you may have a wait coming back unless you're a Seven Stars, Diamond or Platinum player. Spa at Harrahs was okay. Facility is very mediocre and massage was okay. Definitely go to Caesars - awesome facilities and my massage and facial were also awesome. All the properties are running summer specials so they're at excellent prices. Also had a manicure at the Riviera which was decent. Pool at Harrahs was okay. There's a place on the right side with misters so you can stay cool. There's also a sundeck upstairs on the left hand side. However, Caesars pool was much nicer even though there was construction around, the noise wasn't that bothersome. Casino is small and there wasn't a lot of choices. I lost several thousand and I felt like they didn't care or pay that much attention to rate me. I only had $26 in comps. I felt Caesars was much nicer and took care of me. Ballys was okay. Even though my room was comped based on my previous play, I don't think I would stay there again. My boyfriend said he would stay again but he wasn't in the room that much.

As many have noted, the casino is very smoky and the decor looks old and washed out. It is listed as a 4 star hotel but I would say more like 3 at best. There were two things that I really noticed about this trip to Vegas. The first was that no one was winning anything, except at the craps table where the odds are best. No noisy, squealing slots, no excited Black jack players, no nothing. The bottom line, casinos are hurting and they need to make up for their lost revenue somehow. Gone are the days of inexpensive food as well. The second things I noticed was how trashy everything was, the streets, the hotels, the kiosks and even the people. Again, keep in mind the cheap prices and I think you can understand what I mean. Men standing outside of casinos giving out very graphic escort cards didn\u2019t help much.

I understand that Harrahs is cutting back but they are not maintaining any kind of good customer service becasue of the lack of personnel.

I had not been there for about 3 or 4 years. This time we stayed at Harrahs on the strip. Harrahs is in a great location. Right in the center of all of the action. If you don't want to rent a car, it is a perfect location since it is within walking distance to the Flamingo, Ballys, Cesars, Imperial Palace, MGM Grand and Paris. We got an upgraded room at check-in. We asked for a fridge for my friends medication, which they said was no problem and would deliver it to the room promptly. Check in time ( line) took about 50 minutes. The room was nice and clean. Very comfortable beds! However, the fridge did not arrive after waiting approx. an hour so my friend took her meds and put them in the \"mini bar fridge\" and we went on downstairs to gamble. When we got back that evening, the fridge still had not been delivered. We called the front desk and she told us it would be delivered in a few minutes. Again after waiting an hour we decided to go to bed. At noon the next day, stilll no fridge. We called again and finally after about 30 minutes the fridge was delivered. My friend changed her medications from the mini bar to the regular fridge. Harrah's machines need to be upgraded. They still have the same old machines from 10 years ago. They had very few new machines. The machines did not pay off for us. The machines at our local Indian casinos are so much better and newer and they actually pay off! Be prepared to pay for every convience at Harrahs. They charge 4.99 at their ATM's for money or balance inquiries. They charge 3.85 for a glass of tea. An 8 ounce bottle of water is 3.95. 12.00 for a sandwich. An extra 2.00 to get anything to go from their resturants. It cost 5.00 to use their internet to try an access our boarding passes. The internet never did work for us after putting in 10.00. Some drunk on the second floor came out of the Toby Keith's bar and decided to hit me HARD on my butt while I was trying to get the internet access to work. He thought it was halarious. It has been 3 days and I still have a hand sized bruise on my butt. If I had not been so stunned by his actions, I would have immediately called security. Instead, I waited for about 5 minutes and called them when I got back into my room. I asked the front desk to put the 10.00 back on our tab since the internet never would work. They said they had nothing to do with that and I had to call the internet provider to get a refund. I told them about the man hitting me, they connected me with security, who told me I should have called them from the location it happened. Silly me, I thought they had security cameras everywhere. Oh well, live and learn. We had a nice dinner for four at the Outback Steakhouse. Steak and lobster tail for each of us , 3 teas and a water with tip was 176.00 We paid 60.00 per person at the Rio for the seafood dinner and I would not recommend it for the price. Over the course of 4 days, using our Harrahs cards and playing at their sister casino's we only recieved 41.00 in comps. But the biggest surprise of all was at check out. They charged us 50.00 for using the mini bar for my friends medications. Apparently, if you use their in room fridge for anything personal they charge 50.00. NO EXCEPTIONS!! I am guessing that is why it took 2 days to get the fridge delivered to our room. I guess when the economy is bad and people are not spending as much money gambling they feel they have to rob them any way they can to make up the bottom line. Anyway, that was my last trip to Vegas. I will drive the 30 miles to the Indian casinos where they have great comps, all of the newest machines that actually pay off and treat me with respect. Over the years I have been to Vegas probably 20 times. I have stayed in the some of the least expensive to the most expensive hotels. I have found the best way to do Vegas is to rent a condo, and rent a car. That way you have all of the comforts of home and a car to go anywhere you want to go, anytime you want to go. The condos are usually about 150 to 250 for a week and the car is about the same. The condo will usually sleeps at least 4 and has washer and dryers, dishes, cooking utensils, outdoor grills, complete kitchens, a jaccuzi in the condo and a pool outdoors.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "north carolina", "Title": "\u201cBest location,Best Deal,Best buffet,Love the outdoor carnival theme !!!\u201d", "Author": "scenicrentals", "ReviewID": "UR34306630", "Content": "We had the best time ever , great deal and room was very nice good size and away from noise .Great selection of economical food and stores One minor complaint staff at other harrah's have been much more attentive but for price don't mind if they don't look up when they talk to you .

After reading the reviews I was scared to death because a lot of them were negative. Harrah's was totally awesome. I was stunned. The room was neat and tidy, roomservice was excellent, and my husband upgraded our room to a \"view\", because it was my first Vegas trip. It was a perfect view. I could see the full volcano erupt at the Mirage. It was perfect. I did learn a few things as a first time Vegas visitor and expecting the worst. I feel obligated to share. 1. There were lots of negative reviews about the \"smokey\" smell of the hotel/casino. HELLO! The hotel was built in 1972, people were smoking EVERYWHERE (you couldn't escape it). Have some freaking sense people! Smokers are going to smoke hence a \"smokey\" smell. I think a lot of the reviews were dramatized. My husband is allergic to tobacco smoke, he did not have one allergy attack. It wasn't that bad at all. 2. There were lots of negative reviews about \"upgrades with a view\". OK, I personally think that when people hear \"a view\" they think of the movies where you can see the whole strip. That ain't gonna happen at Harrah's, youre in the middle of the strip. The views are great but don't set yourself up for disapointment. 3. There were lots of complaints about the rooms, plugs, and things of that nature. What I don't understand is, why would you go on vacation to Vegas and sit in your hotel room and play on your laptop, text on your phone, and watch TV. That is a waste. The rooms are totally efficient to those who go to Vegas to play. If you have other intentions this is not the hotel for you. Only bad side of the room, no in house coffee pot. That sucked. There where a few other things that I wish I had a warning about. Here's the tips for first time Vegas vacationers. 1. Plan extra cash for food, we sooooo underbudgeted meals. It's not cheap to eat in Vegas no matter what people tell you. 2. There are people handing out \"dirty\" business cards everywhere. A teenage boys dream! These cards end up scattered all over the ground and can be easy to slip on. 3. Don't get obliterated drunk in Vegas. C'mon people, it's ok to drink but know when to say when. I thank God I have a big heart, I helped quite a few girls find their hotel rooms when they could barely walk. One girl was in the wrong hotel. Not good people. I personally think Vegas is not for families, but who am I to judge? I did have a personal problem with people with babies in their strollers, walking around at 1 AM. I do think that's way inappropiate. Please people, Vegas is great and I wish I would of had my little boy with me to see LOVE, the Volcano, and the Bellagio fountains. But as a parent, I know he can wait a while to see that stuff, plus I video taped it for him. Overall Vegas is an adult town, not recommended for small children. MY OPINION ONLY! Last tip: Check on Toby Keith's Bar and Grill. Good food, great service.

We were told all the rooms in the Mardi Gras Tower have been recently refurbished/updated. If the view from your window is important to you, stay away from Room #506 and other even #'s rooms around it and the floors below it as it faces the heating/air conditioning units. The room was well appointed & spacious. We could not hear hallway noise but we could hear our neighbors very well through the connecting suite door. If you like your room kept cool, keep the air conditioning set at the lowest temperature. We think the a/c might be motion activated since we found it became cooler the longer we were back in the room as if it wasn't on all day long. We pulled the curtains closed to try to keep the room cool but the maid service pulled them wide open every day after cleaning the room. The ammenities bar is set up with some kind of monitoring system that will charge you for just removing the item from its spot so if you do not want what you see, don't even move it! Bathroom was spacious and clean. Towels very clean. Shower pressure not so good but adequate. Flat panel television in the bathroom was a nice touch. Bed was very comfortable and sheets & blanket were very clean. Onto the casino. Unfortunately, NOTHING influenced me to gamble here. The casino is very dingy & outdated. I was surprised that Harrah's has let it go so much since it also owns so many upscale casinos on the strip. The slots are boring & the tables mundane. I'm not sure what the theme of this hotel is as it's trying to be many things for many people at the same time. I would suggest they hire someone to clean the glass doors of the main entrance every 30 minutes as they are full of greasy handprints all the time. Nothing is inviting to the outside passerby to stop by & gamble. Skip the restaurants especially the cheap steak & eggs late night dinner. Go to Denny's for breakfast a few steps down the street. You'll save a ton of $$. I'm predicting that this casino will be the next one to be imploded because the cost to update & refurbish it will be more than to just start over.

There are some pretty good things about staying at Harrah\u2019s for one the location is amazing, Harrah\u2019s is pretty much center strip so if you want to go on the gondolas in the venetian or see the fountains of the Bellagio it\u2019s all a short walk or a monorail stop away. Secondly contrarily to what people say I felt the prices at the restaurants were pretty reasonable.

The rooms are pretty small true but you\u2019re in Vegas there is no need to stay in the room for long periods of time. Now for the bad, the pool is terrible. They are definitely going to have to close the pool soon and change the lining on the floor it\u2019s lumpy and falling apart and to top it off the pool area is extremely dirty. We stayed there for four nights and went to the pool every day to tan and there was a bloody bandage right next to the steps of the pool from the day we checked in till the day we left. Also we went to use the Jacuzzi at nine thirty am one day only to find that there were cups and beer bottles still laying around it from the night before pretty gross.

For all those who have already booked a room at Harrah\u2019s beware check your credit card statements while you are there. Harrah\u2019s ask for a deposit when checking for room service and incidentals the receptionist will say you can either give her two hundred dollars in cash for this or your credit card will be charged one hundred dollars a day on incidentals, which the hotel will hold until you check out. Needless to say we gave them cash only to find out two days later that they were taking money out of my card anyway, I had to go downstairs and speak to a supervisor twice before they fixed this needless to say it was a big headache.

My first room that had a mini bar but of course I didn't dare use it. There were 2 queen beds with no bed spreads on them for which I am glad of. The bathroom was very large and nicely appointed with nice toiletries. The tiling looked to be new. The one thing I was very impressed with was the way the room doors close. They close quietly not with a banging sound. Excellent invention! I was very pleased with the room overall and would stay there again in a heart beat.

This past weekend (May 30-June 2) my boyfriend and I flew out to Las Vegas with a couple of friends for a long weekend vacation. When arriving in Las Vegas we came right to Harrah\u2019s and were able to check right in. I mentioned to the lady that checked us in that we had a Premium room booked, and showed her my reservation confirmation page. She then told us that were in a Luxury room, and we thought, all the better. She told us we were going to have a view of the strip and would be able to see the Mirage Volcano erupt at night out of our ceiling to floor window. Who wouldn\u2019t want that, right? So after we finish checking in we head up to our room, located in the Mardi gras tower on the 16th floor, and come to find out that our room isn\u2019t so luxurious to say the least. First, the television would not work, so we had to call maintenance to come and fix the television. It was unplugged. Second, our air conditioner would not run for longer than 5 minutes, and then in order to turn it back on, we had to keep on getting up and walking past the sensor on the thermostat. Again we had to call maintenance to come to our room to fix the thermostat, so the air would constantly stay on. Our room still did not remain cold. Third, whenever my boyfriend or I would shower, the water from the shower would leak out all over the bathroom floor. So we ended up having to leave both the shower curtain and the curtain liner in the tub to reduce the water that was on the floor. Regardless, there would still be water on the floor. Also, I was not happy with the pool. It was impossible to get chairs to lie out on, or even a table to have lunch at. Once we were able to get a high top table, close to the bar, it was even harder to get a waitress to be waited on. Once we were able to track down a waitress to order drinks and food, the service time wasn\u2019t too bad, although the food wasn\u2019t all that appealing. I ordered a grilled chicken caesar wrap, and the lettuce was green with brown edges, and came out soggy. My friend ordered a cheeseburger with no tomato or onion, and both tomato and onion came out on the burger. Once lunch was over, we decided to go into the pool, next thing we know, they are setting up a volleyball net, that takes up the entire width of the pool, and is placed right in the center. So once in the pool, the volleyball game starts and my friend ends up getting hit in the head by the ball. So because of that we decided to get out of the pool, since there really wasn\u2019t anywhere you could go in the pool that was safe from the volleyball game. I was not too pleased with the pool, and spent the rest of my pool time at Caesar\u2019s for the duration of the vacation. I am rather disappointed in the room that we ended up in and the pool, and because of that would probably not stay at Harrah\u2019s again when I come out to Last Vegas. Regardless of the room that we did stay in, the casino, the restaurants and the bars were fun and good places to hang out.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "anchorage", "Title": "\u201ccomfortable and clean, good value\u201d", "Author": "wiscjudy2001", "ReviewID": "UR31246534", "Content": "I was very happy with maid service and food options offered.

They left us standing at the check out counter for more than 15 minutes. The manager did not come out but the clerk again came and told us that they would comp us for the beers, but that we had also had dinner there. This was not read to us the first time around and we did no such thing!! We requested to see the signature on the dinner bill but they could not produce it since they were closed in the accounting dept. When she read us the bill the first time through, there was no dinner listed. They threatened to call security because we still wanted to speak to a manager. After a good 1/2 hour of arguing, the clerk said they would not charge us unless the signatures matched, and we would have to wait to see if it was on our Visa bill. We left before they could add more false charges. I have received my Visa bill for the Package and it was 160.00 and change. I guess I will have to wait for the next bill to see if I was charged anything else above the phone call that I made. I have confirmation of the package I purchased and all paperwork.

I told the desk person that we NEVER use the mini-bar in our hotel rooms no matter where we are. However, she pointed out that it's hotel policy to take a $50 deposit from each customer. I asked her when it would be returned back to my account. She said it can take up to two weeks. Two weeks ?? Luckily and all fairness to the hotel, I received my deposit back within two days after we checked out. However, the check-in line wasn't that long but we had to wait forever since there were only two people working the counter. The rooms were okay but no coffee pot, no micro (in short no frills).

When I came back down from my room a policeman happened to be standing chatting to someone and I asked him where is the hotel Lost and Found. He was an extremely nice and calm man and asked me what I lost, where and when and told me to come with him. We went through a maze of doors down into the basement where there were all sorts of offices and locker rooms for hotel employees.

When we arrived at 5:00pm on Thursday to check-in we encountered a line of 30 people and only 2 desk clerks. Check-in took well over an hour. Another budget cut = no more free bungee cords for your players cards...you have to buy them in the gift shop! Luckily I had my own. Our room was very nice and we were offered a choice of view: Caesar's Palace or the Volcano at Mirage. We chose the Mirage view. Our 2 queen room was very nice and newly updated with marble floors in the entry and bath. We encountered a problem with 1st night with our room. It was directly above the loading dock which is used by Harrah's and McDonald's. Even with foam ear plugs we could hear the non-stop back up beepers on the hundreds of trucks. It went on all night and we slept very, very little. We asked to move to a quieter room and happily took a view of the top of the parking garage and mountains = no beeping trucks! We dined at the buffet and the cafe twice and all meals were excellent!! We also ate at the buffet at one of their other properties, The Flamingo and it was outstanding, especially if you love seafood! They had some of the best crab I have ever eaten and crepes station that was heavenly! My mom and I both enjoy the slot machines. We found the ventilation to be excellent in the casino and the beverage girls were some of the best I have ever seen. We never had to wait for a drink. We never made it to the pool as it was only in the 60's during our stay. We would 100% stay there again. I highly recommend joining the Total Rewards players club (free) if you gamble at all. You earn credits with every bet or purchase. These credits or comps can be used at any dining venue, gift shop, shows, etc. All of our food was comped. Location: Harrah's has an excellent location on the strip. It is directly across the street from Caesar's Palace and Mirage and is just s short walk to the Paris and Bellagio and the Venetian is right next door. It is also one of the stops on the monorail or you can pay $7.00 for a 24 hour pass on the Deuce which runs the strip and goes to old downtown. If you take a taxi from the airport DO NOT let them take you on the freeway or down the strip. Tell your driver you want the back road, fast route to Harrah's and you will get there for about $12.00.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "mooresville n.c.", "Title": "\u201cwonderful\u201d", "Author": "donnaarmour", "ReviewID": "UR29799550", "Content": "the location was great-middle of the strip-clean rooms. hoover dam-wow timeshares to pushy. toby keit's i love this bar best ever.

So all we were hoping for was a clean room but our expectations were exceeded. We got there around 10 a.m. Vegas time and were able to get into our room only an hour later. That was fine with us because check-in isn't even until 3 anyway so we weren't even expecting to get in that soon.The woman working at the front desk was extremely helpful. She gave us suggestions on where to go and encouraged us to sign up for the Total Rewards which gave us free slot play and coupons. The entire staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The room, which was just a standard room, was very spacious with a marble entrance, pretty decor, marble bathroom and very clean. Plenty of towels each day!! The bed was a little stiff but nothing to get upset over. It was a great experience in a CENTRAL location on the strip. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone. I wouldn't even splurge with the deluxe rooms because they are on the noisy side where Carnaval Court is. Carnaval Court was really awesome by the way, check it out!!! Live bands during the day turns night club at night. The pool is mediocre but the volleyball net they put up is really fun!!! Just bring your own alcohol. The pool had the most expensive alcohol I saw the entire time in vegas. Some tips: Check out the free volcano show at the mirage, siren show at treasure island, fountains at bellagio, tigers at mirage, sky inside of caesars, lions AT MGM, circus acts at circus circus, show in the sky at RIO.... ALL FREE!!!!!!!! Get deuce tickets!! MUCH cheaper than taxi and goes up and down the strip plus downtown where all the CHEAP gambling is. By the way make sure you check out downtown even if you don't like gambling. They have the free light show on Fremont with drag queens performing live music.... def the \"vegas vibe\" downtown. Slots A Fun: $2 dollar blackjack and .50 roulette. Also, those big drinks you see everyone walking around with on the strip that are $20 dollars? They are only $8.00 at Slots a fun and you get 4 shots. .99 hot dogs! You will just have to get past the smell of this place... not that pleasant. Fun though!!! If you want your money's worth in alcohol go to margitaville for a margarita!! It's two hotels down from Harrah's and they pour a STIFF drink. For a good burger, Stripburger is the best. Might be the best burger I've ever had :P Don't by nightclub passes before going or wait before you are in line. They give em out free everywhere on the strip!!

I checked in while my husband waited in the rental car. After 30 minutes he came in to check on me. I waited in line for almost 45 minutes to check in, with only about 20 other customers. There were 3 people checking in guests and one kept going over to what we in line were calling the 'highrollers' check in. Some special gambling card or something. So after 50 minutes I finally got checked in and got our room keys. We stayed at the very end of the hall which was nice. It was quiet in the hallway but the room was a different story. The room was up to date and tastefully remodeled. HOWEVER you could hear EVERYTHING from the upstairs room and the 2 rooms on either side of us. This includes~ah~ the bathroom. Not the revele I want to wake up to! Our room gal cleaned that room SPOTLESS every day and in fact it was on par with the Westin in Vegas as far as cleanliness goes! I was impressed by the house keeping staff. Only complaint: we re-hung our towels so they would not be removed and laundered on a daily basis, but our room lady removed them and laundered them every day. Harrah's had a card out about helping conserve water. Well we tried. The main 24 hour cafe was a good value and we had the $7.99 steak and shrimp a couple nights. It was ok/fine. Good service in the cafe. Starbucks was great and so was the sundry store. I used my $30.00 credit at Starbucks and at the sundry store. The casino was fairly busy but VERY VERY smoky. Lots of the people there were older than us and were smokers. It was unbearable at times. Harrah's needs to invest some $$ and upgrade their ventilation system if they want the non-smoking crowd to stay/play there! This is why we've almost always stayed at the Paris or Westin Causarina when in Vegas. The Westin is a non-smoking property and the Paris has great ventilation! The slots were very tight and I did not see many winners and myself was not a winner of anything. Usually I manage to break even at the least. Not this time. The hotel was ok for the value and the highpoints of our stay was the $30 resort credit and the good 'rewards' card program that is used at Harrah's and her sister properties. I racked up enough points for a $10 to spend in resort credits! I used a the buffet at the Paris and Starbucks in Harrah's. Overall $55 bucks for a very clean but noisy room and a smoky casino it was a good deal. We tried cheap and it was ok, but not what we wanted.

There was no one in line so it was fast. We were three women staying in a room with 2 double beds, so we also asked for a cot. This was brought up to us within 5 minutes of arriving. The cot was basically like a single bed. All the beds were comfortable. The sheets didn't fit like all the other reviews say, but it's because they were too big. It was no big deal. Our room was large but unfortunately overlooked the employees parking lot and a garbage can down below, but who cares, we weren't there to hang out in our room. It was quiet except in the morning when we heard the garbage truck, but that was fine because we wanted to wake up anyways. We never heard any of our neighbours. The maids cleaned it very well every day. My only complaint about the room was that the bathroom fan didn't work and the hotel doesn't offer a service where they will save water by not washing your towels as long as you hang them up. It felt like a waste to have new towels every single day, but then again, the whole of Las Vegas seems like an environmental nightmare! So rooms were nice, check-in was fine. Check out took longer as everyone was lining up to check out at the same time. The clerks were very friendly and helpful. They booked us a trip to see the Grand Canyon. The casino has a lower ceiling that most casinos but also seemed brighter then most casinos. We didn't do much gambling anyways. We heard that if we gambled we could get a free drink, so we tried the penny slots for a few minutes but no free drinks! The only place we ate inside the hotel was the Chinese restaurant called Mings Table, which was very good. There is a Starbucks just below the elevator where we had coffee in the morning, but of course Starbucks are everywhere in Las Vegas, expensive and long lineups. Compared to other hotels that we looked in, Harrahs had less cheap restaurants (no fastfood or Subway) and not as many stores, which I liked because it got us out of the hotel. The best thing is the location. We are right across from the Mirage, which we ate in two nights(great restaurants), 5 minute from Treasure Island, The Wynn and some shopping on one side, and then 2 minutes from the Caesers Palace Forum shops and then less than a 15 minute (great) walk to Paris Las Vegas on the other side, passing the Flamingo and other places. Some people say that it needs to be updated, and one of my party thought that as well. The theme seems to be New Orleans Carnivale (which is creepy anyways if you ask me with all those masks) but I barely noticed that. It is newer than most hotels you will see on a typical road trip through North America, it's just that in Las Vegas everything has to always be so new to keep up with the Jones (ie-the other hotels) Also the Monorail is attached to Harrahs.

The room was very clean, no complaints. We loved the casino and poker room. Our main reason for coming to Vegas was for poker and Harrah's did not dissapoint.

The CWs were great in the whole casino but especially in the poker room. The casino itself is very big and we had a great time there.

The Range was excellent (A+, beautiful view overlooking the forum shops, excellent service. The meal was great, the steaks very tender, cooked perfectly and the sides were awesome. Also tried the spa for a nice massage. They were doing some remodeling in the lobby area but you couldn't hear any noise so it wasn't bad. They had some good specials going and the price was well worth it. Nothing very fancy but it did the job. The pool was a nice area to lay out and have some drinks. The bartenders were very good and quick. The pool isn't very lush or tropical; it is on the small side. I had a good time by the pool but it would have been better if it was bigger.

This casino is always lively and in the front their are some open doors so you can actually see outside. Right outside the door there is a big open bar and concert area that fun and always has a good band playing. And in the casino there is a lounge bar that has nightly piano acts that are fun to watch and free. The only thing that I can possibly think of that might be considered a draw back is the pool.

Best: beds Worst: Mini bar/Fridges. ** These fridges have about 4 bottles of water in them yet YOU CAN\"T USE THEM. I threw some pop in there when we arrived and i would have been charged for using the mini bar based on 'weight' - be careful - it looks like a fridge but it is a 'phony money-making fridge'.

The food was good and there were lots of choices. it was convenient to just get in there and eat without having to wait - especially with the large group we had. We also had one lunch at the other restaurant - can't remember the name (not Ming's). The food was plentiful and good - but there is usually a line-up to get in. Also they advertised a lunch special - but once we were seated we were told it was not available on the weekend. The sign advertising the special made NO mention of this - a bit of false advertising? Gaming tables: Minimum bet required a bit too high for newcomers like us. Piano Bar and Toby Keith's bar - both fun. Pool: Nothing fancy -had lots of chairs, outdoor bar and towels. We enjoyed it. Checkout: LONG lineups. Internet charges to our rooms even though no one brought a laptop - watch your charges closely. Took us 40 minutes.

We had asked for a king but they only had a room with 2 queens available. The view from our room, however, was beautiful! We did not face the blvd. but we had a nice view of Vegas and the mountains in the background. After touring some of the other hotel casino's, I thought Harrah's was rather plain. Some of the other casino's were much nicer and had more room to move around and high ceiings, etc. We ate in the Cafe, Toby Keith's bar and also the buffet. The Cafe was just O.K. and the buffet for breakfast was great. The dinner buffet was just O.K. but did have quiet a lot to choose from, most of which I did not eat. The dessets were the best part of the buffet. The Toby Keith's was rocking at night and we had a blast. They had a good band two of the nights we were there. The other nights it was a D.J. They played a lot of country line dances towards the end of the night which I love. The waiters put on a show with the juggling of the bottles, etc. The mason jar is the way to go for $15.

We were pleasantly surprised to find that we were permitted to check in 6 hours earlier than specified and found the front desk staff helpful and accommodating. We were given a room on the 26th floor of the Carnival Tower with a view of Caesar's, the Rio, and the pool. The room was clean,the bathroom also had a bathtub, which our last hotel didn't have, two closets and a nice sitting area near the window. We purchased a cheap coffee maker at Walgreens so we could have coffee and Baileys in the mornings, rather than having to get dressed and go downstairs to get coffee (our only complaint). There was a bit of noise at night from the outdoor bar downstairs, but we weren't really concerned about getting our eight hours of sleep every night. The food in the cafe was good, as was the buffet. Toby Keiths was excellent (be careful of their special drinks - mine had 6 oz of alcohol...yum...The waitress gave me a \"to go\" cup because I couldn't drink it all with my dinner). Using our Total Rewards points, we got two free meals each, several souveniers from the gift shop, and a further discount on the room. There was a great variety of slots, more than in Caesar's for example, and we spent a lot of time in the casino. We ended up winning $400-$500 pots on quarter slots many times each, and went home with almost everyting we took. The location is great, and the Monorail access saved our feet many miles of walking.

Overall the hotel is very nice and has a great location being right across the road from Caesars Palace and in the middle of the strip. We stayed here mainly for the price. Free, through my Total Rewards players card. But I would stay here again even if I had to pay for it. We were in a remodled deluxe room with 2 queen beds and it was very nice, clean and modern with a limited view of the strip. The buffet is one of my favorites and have been there several times before this trip. Great food and price is around $15-20 depending on when you dined. Price is inline with about every other hotel on strip. Not cheap anymore like old days! The only other place in Harrahs we ate was the 24 hr. cafe. They have good food anytime and the pizza pie is great after a night of drinking some beers! For entertainment we went to Toby Keith's bar. Even though I hate hillbilly music it was a good time with a good crowd and not bad drink prices. Also went to the dueling piano bar and watched the twin girls. Very entertaining! We also hit a country bar called Stoney's Rock N Country down by the Southpointe hotel. Again, not a country fan but wanted to go to a club for people of any age group and are not many of those left. (normally go to Polyesther's in Stratosphere, but was closed for remodeling). So we found this place with a $10 cover and a $20 all the draft beer you drink deal till 4am! It was like an old Gilly's, huge with the mechanical bull and giant dance floor with giant video screens everywhere. They also played some rock music also. Would really recomend if you like country music. The casino area of Harrahs is spread out and alot like any other casino. Harrahs is not the best on the strip but it is everything you would want or need unless you want to overpay on the high dollar snobby themed hotels. As far as Vegas in general. I have been going there for over 25 years now and it has changed so much in that time. Not always for the better. The prices on everything(shows,food,drinks,rooms,) are inflated and it is almost getting to overbuilt and congested. Almost too much anymore. With this bad economy they should maybe think about going back to the way they used to do business. We were there wed-sat. and it was really dead until the weekend.

Dated - Outside of \"Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill,\" everything in the hotel is outdated: the rooms, casino, restaurants, etc. 8. Timeshare Salesmen - Harrah's places these salesmen right beside the elevators. This means every time you go to and from your room, you get heckled by them. They are rude, obnoxious, and treat you with sarcasm as if they are doing us the favor by heckling us. 7. Old People - It feels as if 80% of the people at the hotel are over the age of 60. Everywhere you look there are old people, many of whom smell. 6. Cheap Slots - I realize the economy has not been friendly to Vegas, but that doesn't mean you must make all the slots stingy. Don't bother playing at Harrah's, I would go over to Wynn or MGM Grand. You'll get more bang for your buck. 5. Slow elevators - It took longer to get to the sixth floor of Harrah's than it does the 20th floor at The Mirage. Let's speed it up Harrahs! 4. Pool - Where did they get this pool setup, Motel 6? 3. The Room - Tube TV, rock hard mattress, small shower, no view. 2. Fashion - Ladies, black shorts with black tennis shoes with white socks with a baseball cap does not look good. It's Vegas, not West Virginia! 1. Price, Price, Price - For the same price, you can stay at Treasure Island, Flamingo, Bally's, MGM Grand, Excalibur, and Luxor: all of which are far better. We paid $39.99 for this room, and if I had to do it over again, I would have stayed somewhere else.

Here are the downfalls: the casino seems much more smokey then others we visited, no coffeemaker or mini fridge in room, and the buffet.......ugh. We had both a dinner and breakfast buffet while we were there. Considering the number of people flowing through the buffet you would think the food would be hot, but almost everything I chose, was luke warm at best (and the OJ at breakfast was not cold either). The food just wasn't very special or appetizing. They did have some nice desserts, though.

Stayed on a Friday night on MLK weekend. Great location. Room itself was ok, not a Marriott but a level below. Young partiers next door were really really really loud but finally left at 11:30 PM probably to go to the clubs. When I checked in, I was told by the clerk/reservationist who checked me in that I was entitled to a a \"freebie or coupon or a voucher\" something like that , where I can use any service within the hotel gift shops, restaurants, etc for up to $30 and I would be credited for it. I asked the clerk if he could give me a coupon or card to use for this. He assured me - all I would have to do is charge the service to the room, and when I checked out, they would deduct up to $30 of the charge from my final bill for the room. So the next morning, I went to the coffee shop and had a breakfast that totaled $17.50. Actually I really did not have much for breakfast, the coffee shop is not cheap. But I was getting this free, right? Well after the meal which I charged to my room, I quickly went back to my room and as I travel light, I was checking out within 5 minutes of leaving the coffee shop. When I dropped off my room key, the clerk told me I did not have any charges. Since I had pretty much just left the coffee shop, I told the clerk that I just had a meal that he probably would not see on his display, but it was charged to the room and was less than the $30 credit. I said that I wanted to double check with you that I would not be charged this amount on my credit card. He said that I wouldn't. Believe me, I would not have eaten breakfast at this hotel if I knew it wasn't free. I just got my credit card statement and they did charge me for it. I called the hotel and talked to the billing clerk and she said her manager told her to tell me that they can't refund my card, and that I would have to call Last Minute Travel to take care of this. This made no sense, but I did call Last Minute Travel, and they said that there is nothing they can do since they did not offer this comp/credit. Bottom line here, if you are offered this kind of extra or freebie, get it in writing or get a coupon, and if they won't do that, go up the ladder to hotel management if necessary.

Overheard some Casino employees stating Travelocity bookings get what they get. Requested 2 smoking rooms, one with King and one with 2 Queens, and a non-smoking with King. Got 3 non-smoking rooms with 2 Queen beds instead. Was told at check-in shouldn't be a problem to get the rooms requested the next day. Next morning wasted 2 hours trying to change Premium rooms. Even after complaining about the filthy rooms, they were unable to provide the room types booked, and there was no offer of compensation for the filth. Decided to pay $600 to upgrade to 3 Jr. Suites. Still couldn't get any smoking rooms. The hotel confirmed all 3 suites would be ready by 4pm, but when we went to change rooms, only 2 suites were available. Talked to the Manager, but was only able to get an 11th floor Premium non-smoking room for a smoker. It was better than looking at rooftop air handlers, but had to listen to jackhammers during the day at the pool and loud music until 2am from the outdoor bar at night. The 2 Jr. Suites were nice and clean. If you like cold showers these rooms are for you. Bath water was hot, but when you turn on the shower the water turns cold.

The only thing it lacked was a real closet. The room had an amoire type of closet which is part of the wall unit in the room. Good thing we were only there for 4 days otherwise the small closet could have been an issue. We ate at the oyster bar within the hotel which was very good. Best oysters we had in a long time!

People who ran center were very nice and a pleasure to talk to. Rented a car from Hertz for the day. They are located right by the registration desk. Clerk was pleasant, fast, efficient and didn't push the rental insurance. We took a ride to Red Rock Canyon which was about 20 miles from the strip. It was beautiful and worth the trip. Also stopped at the Red Rock Casino. Fabulous hotel with nice casino and great restaurants. Went to Peppermills for a great breakfast. Portions were huge, food really good and place was very Vegas.

Harrahs offered me two free nights in a deluxe room from using my Total Rewards card on the first trip (do sign up, they really do give you comps!). We stayed the first two nights at Imperial Palace and then moved next door to Harrahs. Changing hotels was no problem at all, just walked with our luggage next door around 11am. There was a pretty long line due to everyone checking out at that time but that was to be expected. Staff was not too friendly but not overly rude either. We were just happy to be able to check-in right away and not have to check our luggage at the bell desk(which is outside if you are looking for it). Asked for a strip view but staff said we would have to wait longer to get that so settled for a room on the 15th floor in the Mardi Gras tower. We had no view what so ever but the window was huge, it went from floor to ceiling and if you had something good to look at then it would have been nice. The room was on the small side but clean. We had two queen beds, a small table and chairs, the huge wooden cabinet that held a small tv and on one side had the ironing board and the other a small closet. The room also had a mini bar but don't touch anything unless you want to pay because its motion sensored. The bathroom was also small. The shower would not turn off each day and housekeeping had to come fix it. The sink wouldn't drain after washing your hands. The room layout was just very cramped. It was tight for two people, there is no way that I would suggest trying this room with 3 or 4 people. There are metal srips every few feet in the hallway and the housekeepers are constantly running over them with their cleaning carts and its very annoying when you are trying to sleep. They do not try and come in your room when you have the do not disturb sign up but you know they are out there! The elevators run fast and smoothly. They have seperate ones for the lower number and the higher number floors. The casino is fun, easy to find your way around. Did not see the pool since it was January. Did eat at the Flavors Buffet, thought it was pretty good. You will definitely find enough to eat, they even have sushi on the lunch buffet. Also ate at Harrahs Cafe, I think it was called. It was okay, good place to stop when you are in a hurry to move on to gambling. Did not have very much luck in the casino, mostly played in other ones. Warning on the Mac King Comdey Show...when you check in they will give you a complementary two free tickets coupon. It says that you only have to buy one drink per person for $9.99. Well the day we went Mac King wasn't there, they told us Dave Williamson would be taking his place and the total per ticket comes to about $14 a person once you add in the entertainment and beverage tax. So you get one drink during the show for that price. The show itself was okay. It was about 45 mins long. But you're in Vegas....have fun and enjoy yourself. I would have to say that my stay at IP was better than Harrahs, believe it or not! But I can't complain my nights here were free!

The room ended up being a 2 Queen bed room on the 12th floor facing the strip (view of TI/Mirage and its volcano). The room was wonderful. A 32\" LCD TV in the bedroom and another 15\" LCD in the bathroom. The beds were confortable and had crisp white linens. There was a minibar in the room and ample storage in the closet (inside the built-in cabinet). AC was quiet, but I ended up turning it OFF as it was cool anyhow and I prefer to open the window (to a small balcony) for fresh air. I had an issue with the TV (Stations were not programmed) and within 45 mins of calling housekeeping, a technician came up and fixed right away and showed me how to reset in case it did it again (it did). A bit later, the very nice maid knocked on the door to ensure everything was alright. Daily housekeeping was perfect. Lots of towels, soaps and other toileteries changed as used. The room was quiet, but I could barely hear my next door neighbour through the connecting door. Luckily, most people around that time were single professionals going to CES, so it was not an issue at all. There was no smell of any smoke at all in the room or hallways. Ate 3 times at the buffet and it was alright. Good choice for breakfast with all the usuals (including made to order eggs). Keep an eye in the Carnival court for a girl handing out $5 off coupons valid anytime.

On arrival we were offered an upgrade to a Junior suite for $50 a night or $75 for a top floor Exec Suite with Jacuzzi and view of the Mirage volcano. As it was Xmas and we were there for 6 nights we opted for the Exec suite. Check in was fairly quick and the staff were friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is very central and within walking distance of pretty much everything on the strip. If you have tired feet there is also a monorail station at the back of the hotel. Some think the immediate area is a little \"off\" but apart from the McDonalds next door which does attract some undesirables (both prostitutes and lots of the flicky flicky men when we went) it's absolutely fine at any time of day. In the room we had a living room with a small coffee making/drinks station, a large bedroom with a king bed and a bathroom with jacuzzi, two sinks and a seperate shower. The living room had a sofa and a TV and a dining table and chairs. There was also a small bar type thing in the corner for coffee and with a min bar. The window had view over the strip looking towards the Mirage and the mountains. The bedroom had a large king bed with a big wardrobe, a safe and an iron. There was also a double corner window with views over the Mirage and up the strip towards the Venetian. We could watch the Volcano from our room. The bathroom had a jacuzzi bath big enough for two, a sink each with their own Gilchrist and Soames tolietries and a seperate toilet and shower. Overall I was very impressed with Harrah's. I was a little sceptical of Harrahs as it's less well known but i had nothing to fear. I'm not sure what the standard room is like but in my opinion I think I would prefer to pay for an Exec Suite here for roughly the same price as a standard room in some of the 4 star hotels. Aside from the room the hotel is just like many of the other casinos. The breakfast buffet is fairly average, but we only had it once as there were big queues and it's not really my thing anyway.

Our dinning options were limited and there is no real upscale bar or club. Since it is Vegas we had no problems catching a cab and going over to the Palms or other casino's that had some of the hottest night life around.

Harrah's is a good strip hotel in a great location I stayed here as it was comped to me for my play in July of this year. I love the gaming facility here. It is one of the few casinos that has a $5 stud table. I stayed in the Mardi Gras tower in one of the newly done up rooms. Pleasant and comfortable with 2 plasmas (one in the bathroom - wish it was stuck on the opposite wall so I could watch more comfortably from the bath!). Big king bed with lovely linen ( huge fan of crisp white linen). My room was in the \"quieter\" section of the hotel but faced over the massive air conditioning system ( not noisy to me)- but also had a bit of a strip view ( not really but could see treasure island and the bell tower from the venetian and also the Mirage). I think this was better than being above the live music. And I was given the option at check in. Room service was good. With prompt and friendly service. Check in excellent with the room ready early. One always has to be prepared for the fact that in Vegas rooms may not be ready until late afternoon and that there are often long check in lines (these move fast). No check in line for me at about the 1.00pm mark at Harrahs on a Sunday. I would be staying here again if I could and would recommend this hotel to others. I think it is better than the Flamingo and miles better than the Imperial Palace. However, it still suits a modest budget for a strip hotel in a top location.

After the tour of the Grand Desert property it came down to \"do you see yourselves doing this or not?\" and when we said no it was a very simple okay, let me show you to my manager and we'll get you on your way with your gifts - that amounted to $100 cash (supposedly gaming chips but they gave us cash) and 2 Rio buffets, valued at $51 when we redeemed them. We felt that we made out like bandits. Nothing wrong with time share, but can be an ordeal to talk to a salesperson - not this time! As far as Harrah's - I was very disappointed by how smoky and unpleasant the casino, especially in comparison to some of the other casinos. Even the older ones, like the Mirage, were easier to take. Obviously, people like to smoke when they gamble but not all facilities are set up to clear this out as well as others. However, we loved how convenient this hotel was to the rest of the strip - whether it was the other Harrah's owned properties like the Imperial Palace, Flamingo, Paris, Bally's or the Rio (shuttle runs between the properties) or the others like the Mirage, TI, Wynn, Venetian, Cesears Palace and the Planet Hollywood - a lot has changed since we were last in Vegas and we loved the central location. Plus, having the monorail at the back of the hotel (not too long a hike, like it is some other resorts) made it easy to get to Hooters & MGM on the south end of the Strip and the Hilton and even up to the Sahara on the north end. Be sure to check out the Deuce for transportation up & down the strip and to Fremont street/downtown - for $5 a 24-hour pass was an even better deal than the monorail with a further reach for explorers. Our room was very comfortable, even though it was only on the 5th floor of the Carnival tower - which meant NO view and some thumping and other sounds from the music on Sunday night late into the night, but not so noticeable Monday & Tuesday night of our stay. We were surprised to find it so clean and pleasant after reading some of the other reviews - this was a room that the desk clerk informed us had not yet been renovated so we had low expectations. But all turned out well and we were quite happy, the room was quite spacious and met our needs. I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone considering a lower priced option right on the strip - you will find the time share folk everywhere up & down the strip, just get comfortable with saying no, really, no - unless you want the freebies they are offering and are willing to play the game.

I found the room comfortable - there isn't much to say. It was quiet - I didn't hear much activity from the adjoining rooms. Bathroom was large and the shower/water pressure and temperature were good; plenty of hot water in the morning when many people are showering. I had breakfast at the buffet one morning, and it was good. I had two problems here. First is that at night I could hear the rock band playing at the hotel bar that adjoins the strip. It wasn't loud, but could be heard - it might annoy sensitive people. It stopped about 12:30 to 1 am. This will only affect some rooms, and if you are on the other side of the Carnival tower or in the Mardi Gras I don't think you will hear it. Second was that the housekeeping did not replace the washcloths as they took them to be laundered. On the last day this left me with none, which I consider atrocious. When I called in the evening to get some (when I noticed) they didn't bring them up. But a second call the next morning was quickly taken care of. At checkout I was told that the laundry company that serves all the hotels didn't deliver to anyone. Even if that were true, the staff should know not to take the old ones if they have no fresh washcloths to leave. This was probably a one time issue and wouldn't stop me from returning. But it was an area that needs improvement. (I left a smaller gratuity, and a note, so the housekeeper will hopefully know better if it happens again.)

The room was average, somewhat dated and probably due to a remodel in the next few years to keep the hotel competitive. The only really thing I notice is the cabinet the TV sits in is rather obtrusive when the doors are open, if you get up in the middle of the night , be warned. The common areas where similar to the room, nothing that set them off either positive or negitive but dated and need of minor repairs. We ate at the 'The Cafe\" for breakfast one day, not really all that great, watery eggs, way too large of portions of mediocre food and a touch over priced for breakast fare.

Overall stay at Harrahs is perfect because of the location. I agree with the others that drink service is abundance and the hotel is nice. Now the bad news. The old Vegas is GONE. I spent 3 full days gambling (Blackjack, slots) at several casinos and all I can tell you is check your luck at the door because these casinos have changed and made it much, much harder for you to have an edge over them. Three years ago I came and consistenly fared well at Binions, Harrahs, Flamingo, MGM, Ballys. Most all of these casinos now deal 6 decks. You can get a 1 or 2 deck but with payout and rule changes. Blackjack now only pays 6/5 on the low decks(1-2) and you CANNOT double down after splitting( some casinos have exceptions-for now). At first, I thought I was just having bad luck but as the days followed and I watched other people, I noticed noone I saw winning at either slots or tables( and I looked at alot of tables). I was actually impressed by this- alot of people losing so consistenly...everywhere, not just Harrahs. Friday night, I deceided to go outside of Harrahs properties( pretty much all of the surrounding properties) and see if this is a growing trend and unfortunatley it was.

I just don't understand how rooms aren't ready at 10:00 at night, when they know you're coming. Anyway, spent most of our days at the pool. Some people don't like the pool here, but all you need to do is get wet. We had a great time! Great bartenders at the pool bar! Went to the Carnival Court the first night and had a ball. Also went to Margaritaville, and also had a great time. Gambling was pretty good to us. Came across some wonderful dealers. They were very pleasant. Didn't come home broke!

We were given a newly remodeled room (which I can't imagine what the rooms look like that aren't remodeled as this wasn't exactly a glamorous room itself) on the 12th floor of the Mardi Gras Tower. Check-in was great, but that was because we didn't arrive until late at night. As soon as we walked into the room my first thought was that we had been given a room that someone else was staying in! This was due to the fact that a room service tray full of half-eaten food was sitting next to the bed. In addition, there was water bottles, a lei, and other miscellaneous items from a previous guest left on the nightstands, armoire, and work table. The bed was made and the bathroom was clean however. Called the front desk and was told there was not another room to move us to, so they told us to contact housekeeping. Once we got over the shock of walking into a room full of someone else's food and trash, I was able to survey the room itself. The view wasn't too bad -- could see Treasure Island pretty clear, and the room had an itsy bitsy balcony you could go out on. When I mean itsy I mean it is barely big enough for you to stand on, but it was nice to get some outside air. The room was pretty small compared to other Strip hotels I have been in, but nothing below average. Nice plasma TV in the bedroom and bathroom, typical bathroom amenities, water pressure was terrible though! Bed was super comfortable. No real complaints with the room other than housekeeping which based on our initial problem and the fact that we left the room one day and came back to find our room partially cleaned -- we assume housekeeping cleans rooms in stages, as the maid tried to return later on to finish the job (which apparently they forgot to do earlier.) As far as the hotel itself, there is truth to others saying that Wyndham reps are everywhere -- I wish hotels would ban this it is so irritating, so expect to be pushed by sales reps often when walking around. The 24-hour cafe was not that great -- they serve breakfast 24/7 except oatmeal which we tried to order and were told 'because it is so late we don't have oatmeal' -- go figure...food was just so/so. Pool is definitely not much to write home about, plain pool (maybe olympic-sized couldn't tell), with a small bar/cafe. I wasn't lucky at all in the casino but it is fairly good sized. Ate at Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill for the second time...food there is good, but you should expect the wait-staff to be nothing more than eye-candy and you won't be dissapointed. Prices are pretty steep. There are several shops in the hotel, and I was glad to see more than 1 stayed open late. I guess the problem with Harrah's is that their hotel is rather boring compared to others. Everything (casino, shops, restaurants) are just kind of standard....nothing great about the pool etc...basically I would stay there again if it was free, but would not dish out any money for the trip....have a much better time at Rio for sure!", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel & location\u201d", "Author": "phillynathan", "ReviewID": "UR18320249", "Content": "Booked for a get-away last minute.

We chose to go with the mini-suite and ended up getting to stay the 3rd night after all! I couldn't believe it- our first Vegas trip and we got complimentary upgrades to a wonderful mini-suite. The room itself was very nice. It was on a low floor in the Carnival tower and was very quiet and easily accessible. It looked like it was fairly recently renovated as compared to other parts of the hotel. It had marble bathroom counters, floors, and shower features. There was also a lovely floor-to-ceiling closet feature with pull out TV. Also a desk and small table near the window. The space was lovely and had lots of room to walk around in. The bed itself- wonderful! It was a down bed with down pillows. By far the MOST comfortable bed I have ever slept on, and perfect for crashing after a long day on the strip. I honestly almost regret not spending MORE time in the room as opposed to out seeing the sites and gambling. Could never hear the neighbors and the cleaning service was great and the room always looked lovely. it also had a wall-safe, which made it much easier to feel safe leaving things in the room instead of lugging them around the strip. As for the rest of Harrah's- the Cafe was alright. Nothing to special, but hit the spot at nearly midnight. Starbucks was typical- exactly what it should be. The piano bar was loads of fun, and we never even went in- just gambled right outside so we could double up on fun and sing-along while playing the slots. Customer service was AMAZING.

We stayed 3 nights, and I have to say I really enjoyed staying this hotel. Our room was really nice-we actually were supposed to stay in a standard guest room, but at the airport check-in, I slipped $30 to the hotel clerk who upgraded us to a junior suite. The junior suites are really nice, clean, and spacious. The best thing about the hotel, though, was not the rooms (who goes to Las Vegas to stay in a room all day?), but the location and the nightlife. It is perfectly located in the middle of the strip, and the Mirage is literally less than a 2 minute walk once you get outside of the hotel (and remember the Mirage is connected to Treasure Island, which is a really good hotel too). Caesars Palace and the Paris are only a 5-7 minute walk, and I would say the Bellagio is only about a 10, maybe 15 minute walk at longest. All of these hotels have great casinos, which is the only downside of Harrah's (their casino isn't that big and is confusing to navigate). If you're into nightclubs, the surrounding hotels have good ones, and if you're into fine dining, Caesars and the Mirage have excellent restaurants. Furthermore, Harrah's also has a great buffet-it was only about 25 dollars for dinner, and the food and the selection was excellent. The best spot at Harrahs, without a doubt, is Carnival Court. It is a huge outside bar that features live music starting around noon or 1 each day that goes all night. The atmosphere is relaxed and laid back, the people are fun and friendly (which is not the case everywhere in Vegas), and the live music was awesome (even the performers in the afternoon were good). In short, for the price of the hotel, Harrah's is a great choice-if you care more about luxury, then it may not be for you. But if you're just going for a good time, this is hands down the best spot to be at.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bloomington, IL", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SinCityAce79", "ReviewID": "UR17546748", "Content": "We stayed at the Harrahs hotel and resort for 5 nights.

Don't pay the cover to get inside the court because you can view the band from the sides and take your free drink outside the casino and listen to the music.

I arrived early and found out that I had been placed in a newly renovated room. Unfortunately, the room wasn't ready yet - not their fault as I arrived 3 hours prior to check-in time. I was, however, offered a different room that was ready right away but the desk clerk advised me that the newly renovated rooms were very nice and she recommended I wait. I checked a couple of times over the next few hours and my room was finally ready exactly at check-in time. The room in the Mardi Gras tower was very nicely appointed but one of the smallest rooms I've ever had in Las Vegas. Nice big screen LCD TV, but no HD signal so the image was stretched. This is the second hotel I have stayed in recently where recent renovations included a large screen LCD TV but for some reason at the expense of drawer space. Nice granite top in the bathroom, great water pressure, and a smaller LCD TV mounted in the bathroom as well. Nice touch. The new bedding was very comfortable and the room was spotless each day. No working desk - just a cafe table with 2 chairs, but that's pretty much the norm in Vegas. Only problem with the room was that the internet jack was dead when I got to the room and I needed to get on-line quickly. First call to guest services resulted in being told that someone would be right up. Fifteen minutes later I called again and told them that I either needed someone immediately or they would have to switch my room as I needed to get on-line. Engineering was there in 5 minutes and corrected the problem on the spot. I was not facing Carnival Court but a colleague was. I stopped by his room and didn't even realize the band was playing until he opened the sliding door onto his mini-balcony and that's when I heard the music. He was on the 8th floor so either those who complained about hearing the music are either more sensitive to the noise than I, or the renovations addressed this issue as well. The thermostats do turn off during the day when you're not in the room, but then cool down pretty quickly once you enter. Obviously this has been an issue for some guests as there is a card in the room explaining that this does happen, and that the system somehow knows not to turn off at night when you're sleeping. I found this to be true - room temp while asleep was constant and comfortable. Flavors Buffet is great for breakfast, but as other reviews have pointed out go downhill for lunch and dinner in terms of selection and value for $$ paid. Range Steakhouse is a great space with a great atmosphere and service, but the food was only so-so. There are better steakhouses in town at the same price point. Carnival Court was a lot of fun, with two bands alternating and a great bar scene. The Piano Bar is also a lot of fun with Karaoke hosted by a Sinatra wanna-be from 6-9 and then dueling pianos the rest of the night. Great location center-strip and friendly, helpful staff.

The bathroom was clean and the shower had great water pressure and drained good as well!! 2) The Piano Bar is a good place to watch your favorite team play on several TV's. The downside is that drink prices double when the entertainers start playing! The Bad: 1) It seems the only time the drink servers ever came around was in the wee hours of the night, when the casino wasn't so busy, no matter if you tipped them or not. It seems this is one thing dying in Vegas nowadays. We learned to walk to Casino Royal next door and buy the $1 Michelob bottles when we wanted to quench our thirst. 2) Flavors Buffet, for $27 on a Friday night, there sure wasn't much of a choice. The crab legs are split open and then cooked, so the meat is dried out and fishy tasting, and has almost a gritty texture! Save your money and eat elswhere!

I stayed there 2 nights last week during CTIA, and was very disappointed. I arrived at 3:00 a.m. local time on a Tuesday morning after flight delays from the East Coast. Check-in was stressful because the front desk person was reluctant to give me a non-smoking room, which had been reserved and guaranteed for me. The front desk person spoke to the manager, who did give me the non-smoking room. That was a relief but it took about 20 minutes when I was really tired out. One bright note about the hotel: the room itself was actually nice, clean and spacious. But Harrah's isn't an appropriate hotel for business travelers. You have to walk through a very smoky casino to get to the restaurants and to some of the elevators. Garish neon lights are everywhere. It was like staying in a bar with hotel rooms attached. The biggest bummer was that the pool was only open from 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. Again, the hotel's just not for people who are traveling on business. You can smoke and gamble 24 hours a day at Harrah's-- but you can't get in the pool! Go figure! On a brighter note, one morning, we had breakfast at the Renaissance Hotel near the convention center-- and it was wonderful.

Never had to wait for my drink to get empty with the cocktail waitresses. Most rooms overlook the eastern part of the city, or the service road, but who comes to the room to stare out the window? You can request a strip view, but might not be worth the price. The beds are comfortable and clean. Mini bar is a traditional rip off, and prohibits you from storing your own stuff.

First, it's difficult to complain much when you get a $50.00 per night rate plus $25.00 food & beverage credit! At that price I didn't expect much but now feel we received an excellent deal. I asked for a high floor room and was given a room on the 26th floor with a terrific view of the city. My traveling companion asked for adjoining rooms but the best the front desk clerk could do was put us directly across the hall from each other. No problem with that. The front desk clerk was very friendly and accomodating. Check-in was a breeze as was check-out. I do have to mention that housekeeping could be better in the room. There was very noticeable dust on the nightstand. I ran my finger across the clock radio hoping the housekeeper might notice the dust. That didn't happen and the dust was still there the next day after she cleaned the room. The shower could have been a bit cleaner, too, as there were remnants of shampoo or soap on the tub. As I said at the beginning of this review it's difficult to complain about a few small issues. The room in general was in very good condition. The window opened which I really appreciated. We ate breakfast in the buffet both mornings to use the food credit. Harrah's breakfast buffet food selection and quality was very good. The casino was very large and always busy. I didn't have much luck on the slots. Seemed a bit tight, but maybe I wasn't being blessed by Lady Luck this time. Finally, the location is excellent. Walking distance to several of the big hotels.

Have stayed at several Vegas hotels with wife but never at Harrah's. Was skeptical but gave it a try as we didn't really care about the room so much and it was cheap, $59 for a strip view room. Was pleasantly surprised. Room wasn't very big but it was clean, seemed to be recently updated, had a window that opened, the beds were very comfortable with plenty of pillows and the bathroom had updated fixtures such as a shower massage and a power flush toilet. We were in the Carnivale tower and the strip view was partially blocked but we had full view of the Mirage volcano (which was down for repair) and Treasure Island. The location of Harrah's is one of the best on the strip. If you go out the front door of the casino there is a crosswalk that leads directly to Caesar's. Harrah's is right in the middle of a large complex of hotels and is on the monorail for easy access to other properties. Another good thing is that when you arrive (we came in a taxi) check in is right inside the door and the room elevators are just off the lobby, you don't have to drag your luggage through the casino. Check in was fast and easy for us and the room was ready when we arrived. We didn't get bothered by the time share people but if you are a male / female couple they will confront you which is pretty annoying. The drink service was ok if you play the tables and the service at the sports book was good. The sports book at Harrah's is good though my favorite is at Bellagio. We didn't eat at Harrah's so I can't comment on the food but there is a Starbucks just off the room elevators, which was nice.

We were there for a week. We thought that other hotels in the area owned by Harrah's were nice also. Ceasars Palace was the most impressive looking. We stayed in the C tower on 27th floor at Harrahs. Very nice view of the Mirage and the fountain and volcano in front. We even got to see the volcano erupting one night. It was impressive. The room was satisfactory. Nothing wrong with it. Maybe it could have used a few more electrical outlets. The bathroom was good, the mattress and bedding were good. Maidservice was good. We were satisfied with Harrah's all in all. A few hints and suggestions we have are: If you can't walk long distances, don't try to go to other hotels, it looks close but it isn't. Just getting from Harrah's to Ceasars Palace across the street is a long walk. You can rent a mobility cart at Harrah's. (Just like the kind you see at the grocery store only much nicer, smaller and faster) The carts are rented outside the front desk, see the bell captain. If you keep it for like 6 days its $125.00. One day is $40.00, two is like $75.00. So the longer you keep it the price goes down per day. It goes about 20 MPH at top speed and also can be adjusted for whatever speed you want to go. You take it to your room at night and park it and plug it in. It holds a charge all day long. I took mine to 5 different casinos with no problem. (My hip was giving me a problem) There is a shuttle you can catch outside of Harrahs that will take you to the Rio Hotel. From the Rio you can get a shuttle to Ballys, Ceasars Palace, Paris, and maybe one other Harrah's owned hotel, I can't remember. They run every 15 min on Weekends and every 1/2 hour on weekdays. These shuttles are all free and you can take your mobility cart with you. They have a lift and they put it right in the back of the shuttle and they put you on the shuttle first while everyone else has to wait to board. (Makes you feel cared for ya know) The gambling was not good at any of the casinos for us. We played slots ($1.00, 50, 25, nickel and penny. The most we won was $400.00.) We found that all the casinos slots were tight. We gambled at Harrahs, Ballys, Ceasars Palace, Rio, Imperial Palace, and the Venetian. By the way the Venetian is the most impressive hotel we saw. (Of course we didn't see the rooms) When you get to Vegas, take your GPS with you. The cab drivers will take you the long way to your hotel. Whatever you do don't tell them its your first time to Vegas. If you are going to Harrahs tell them you want to go via Paradise Blvd. That is the most direct route. We paid $7.00 more to get to the hotel than we paid to go back to the airport, after we were advised to tell them to take Paradise. Our GPS was packed in a suitcase. At the hotel, if you tell them you need a refrigerator it will cost you $30.00 a day. If you tell them its medically necessary, it will be free. We took a cab a mile and a half away to Von's grocery store and got beer and bottled water and snacks and stuff. Bottled water is $2.25 at the hotels and beer is anywhere from $6.50 to 9.00 a bottle. Except if you are in the casino. We had a great time at the piano bar at Harrahs, they have Karoke also if you are into that. The Mac King I think that was his last name.comedy magic show was hilarious, we rec\\ommend it. Harrah's gave us free tickets to the show, but you had to buy two drinks at a cost of $23.00. It was the cheapest show we saw, but the best. We also went to the Price is Right show at Bally's, it was a lot of fun. We saw the Blue Man Group show at the Venetian. Save your money unless you are in your 20's and love loud banging and strobe lights and toilet paper showered over your head. At $138.00 a ticket, we wanted a refund. The legends show with people imitating Elvis, Bette Midler, Ray Charles, etc. was also nice. You can get a discount equal to the sales tax in the shops owned by Harrahs if you are staying at Harrahs and you ask. I got a suede jacket at 10% off instead of the 8% tax because it was on a display. The plane ride was nice. The airport was not bad, security wasn't bad to get through. All in all except for losing thousands of dollars in the slots, we had a great time. By the way, the buffet at the Rio is a 1/4 mile long and is the best buffet we went to. The Oyster bar at Harrahs was the best also. Try the Broiled crab legs and the fried oysters. We were in heaven. the buffet at Harrahs was also nice.", "Date": "January 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "north carolina", "Title": "\u201cnothing to complain about\u201d", "Author": "pharmy1010", "ReviewID": "UR12967582", "Content": "We stayed here for three days over the Christmas holiday.

This is proof you get what you pay for. Great price on the room, I paid $55 that night, I got what I paid for I guess.

Check-in took a while even though there were not that many people and they had well over 10 counters opened. Got a room that looked out to the Imperial Place, so not much of a view to talk about either. Room size was adequate, but the lighting was terrible. Even with all available lights switched on, the room was so dim you should not attempt to read anything at all! The water pressure in the shower was also quite low and it will take you a while to get your shower done. We also found the bed to be too soft for our comfort, and it certainly does nothing to help stretch out your tired bones after a long day out walking The Strip. You should also beware the refrigerator, which clearly states that everything inside is monitored electronically and the second you remove any item, it will be charged to your account. Sadly, not the entire flooring of the room was carpeted, and even more unfortunate was the fact that Harrah's does not supply any in-room slippers. As such, in the middle of winter, should you wake up in the middle of the night and wish to visit the bathroom, be prepared for a freezing shock once your feet touches the floor. Location-wise, Harrah's offer a relatively good deal, though Imperial Place, The Venetian, Mirage, TI, Bally's, Paris, etc could all probably offer that. Moreover, the layout of Harrah's makes it rather difficult to get to the elevators to get to your room if you enter from The Strip as they make you walk through pretty much the entire casino floor and there are little directional signs to point you in the correct direction. However, if you are one of those who prefer to travel by the Monorail, the station is very conviniently located behind the hotel and you could easily exit the hotel on the 2nd floor and stroll under the covered walkway to the station. All-in-all, not much to rave about for an establishment whose reputation may be bigger than what it can deliver. Might return again if the deal is as good as the one I had.

We ended up liking the Mardi Gras Tower better and asked to be moved BACK over (again they did NO problem). Mardi Gras was newer rooms, more comfortable beds, a little smaller rooms though which we didnt care, flat screen TV in the bedroom and another TV in the bathroom and a little mini balcony, which we LOVED opening our sliding glass door and standing outside and letting the cool air blow in. The other tower is older, the rooms are bigger and the view was more of the mountains and it did have that OLD feel and too much carpet fresh smell. When we checked in the desk person told us that Mardi Gras might be noisy cause we are overlooking the pool and the bands play until 2 or 3am, but there was never a band so this didnt bother us and we didnt even see construction anywhere, so that noise we didnt encounter either. The champagne breakfast buffet @ Harrahs was only OK, nothing great. Wouldnt eat at this one again. My husband and I walked around to all the other mega hotels and some smaller ones and it gets to a point where they pretty much are all the same. Depends on the \"theme\" you want. We thought Harrahas had the friendliest dealers and came around with the drinks more. We loved that this hotel wasnt SO huge that it took you 20-30 min to walk to the Strip. We could easily go from my husbands favorite poker table up to our room or out to the Strip in mere minutes! O'Sheas next Harrahs was a little cheaper table games, but we played poker there for 2 hours one night and not ONE waitress came around, needless to say we didnt go back there.

Our room was located in the Carnival Tower rather than the newly renovated Mardi Gras Tower. The room was clean and without any problems. There were no stains on the carpet and the bathroom was very clean. The room had no odors, but the lighting was a bit dim. The beds are not the greatest. They are standard beds and in looking at the mattresses appeared to be either well kept or fairly new, neither had stains. These beds are not resort quality, but they will do after a long day walking and standing. The water spray on the shower was not the greatest and the pressure fluctuated quite a bit from toilet flushing or other users turning water on and off. The hotel provided the standard face soap, bath soap, combined shampoo and conditioner, body lotion and a shower cap. The room did have a free safe, a mini-bar with very over priced items, and a decent TV. Iron and ironing board included in the closet. The lower portion of the window does open for fresh air. The A/C-furnace does have a motion sensor that will shut off the power to the A/C-furnace when there is no movement detected in the room after a period of time. Our reservation was for a premium non-smoking room with a king sized bed. However, when we arrived at 4pm, the earliest you are supposed to be able to check-in, we were told that there were no non-smoking king rooms available in the premium section. We were given a choice of going to the Mardi Gras Tower to a king bed in a smoking room. We opted for 2 queen bed, non-smoking room in the Carnival Tower. The check-in clerk was very friendly and did say we could move the next day if we liked. She also said we would be getting a strip room view in the Carnival Tower. We were on the fifth floor. Our view was toward the strip looking out at a concrete wall with a very slight view of the very top of the Harrah's sign located out front of the hotel on the strip. So I guess you could say we had a \"Strip\" view. However, since our stay was not to hang out in the room, it really didn't matter. We did not eat at the hotel, but did gamble there. Understanding that you will always encounter smoke in a casino, I usually like to play were the hotel casinos have a good air exchange to minimize the smoke. In my opinion there was either little or no air exchange being maintained in the casino as it always seemed smoky. The staff in this hotel was very friendly and seemed to want to go out of their way to assist you. The parking garage is somewhat cramped, but we never failed to find a parking space up close to the hotel entrance. All in all we found this hotel to be adequate and the location can't be beat. You are so close to the Mirage, Venetian, Treasure Island, Flamingo and Caesars Palace. The Strip Tram is just a short walk to the back of the hotel and will take you to the MGM Grand or to the Sahara and all places in between. Just check for tram coupons in the magazines provided in the room for discounts on the tram rides. We did overhear other people checking in at rates of $250 for a Saturday and $200 for a Sunday night. That would be way too much to pay for these types of rooms.

The view was incredible looking out at Caesar's, Mirage, Treasure Island and beyond to the mountains. Spectacular. Could not have been better. The Mardi Gras Tower is nice because it is so close to being on the strip. Not a mega walk like so many hotels in Vegas these days. Granted, the room is small - okay for two, but I would not want to put more than that in it. But the amenities were nice. The maid service was excellent and room spotless. The staff could not have been any nicer. We were treated like high rollers. I would definitely return to Harrah's. If the price is right, don't hesitate.

HOWEVER, it was on the 3rd floor. When we looked out of the window (if you can call it that!) all we could see was a wall and some kind of pipes. In order to even see daylight, we had to look UP. It was like being in a cave! We slept there 1 night and I asked to be moved. (We had no idea that they were renovating to the extent that they are) Since they had no junior suites available, they just gave us a standard room on the 29th floor. I must say it was wonderful to be able to see outside, and to actually be able to tell where we were! So, getting past that, the beds at Harrah's are WONDERFUL! I'd love to have one that comfortable at home! The housekeeping staff did a GREAT job! The staff in the restaurant where we had our breakfast every morning was very nice. The location is perfect. You can easily walk to many other places. I'm sorry to say that we didn't get to eat at Toby Keith's restaurant, but it looked great! Two things that may be worth passing on are (1) the check-in desk that they say is at the airport by baggage claim is no longer in existance, and (2) Harrah's has a complimentary shuttle that will take you to any of the other Harrah properties (we didn't find this out until the day before we went home)........plus you can get a complimentary bus to Sam's Town (a great place to go). You just go out of the lobby doors and walk past valet and cross the driveway. We went over to Rio on the shuttle to check out their pool (since Harrah's was closed) . Las Vegas has changed so much since we were last there. It's much more crowded......just walking down the street was a challange at times. All in all, it was a pretty good time.

It is on the Las Vegas monorail system, which is handy, and the hotel staff seems nice enough. For starters, this hotel has a tired physical plant that appears to date from the late 70's or early 80's. You're getting none of the excitement of modern Las Vegas, but you are getting the noise, smoke and jumble of a crowded, kitschy, inefficient casino and public spaces. I can't comment on the food because after checking in I spent as little time as possible in the hotel itself. I stayed in this hotel for a trade show. My room was unavailable due to construction (though I made the reservations 6 months in advance I wasn't notified until 48 hours before I left home to arrive here). I was put in another hotel for a night, then when I moved into Harrah's I had to wait in line for an hour to check in because they were still sending people away. They put me in a very grim room when I checked back in; and when I complained they finally moved me into a better room. The \"better\" room I got was a typical Vegas hotel room -- nice enough -- but suffered from extremely poor soundproofing. My first nite in the hotel I was awakened by the guests next door talking and watching tv (at normal volumes) until 3 in the morning...the next night I was awakened a 5:15 in the morning when a different set of guests rose early to catch a flight (which I knew since I could overhear every word they said).

It was cleaned very well each day as well. We did not order room service (however usually we do) so I do not know it that is still up to par. It always had been in the past.

(August 11 through August 18). Since we were staying for a week, I knew we had to be fairly budget conscious and I was thrilled when I happened upon a banner ad offering room rates for $59 a night for weeknights. It took me directly to Harrah's website where I quickly found a great deal for their center Strip location. Their site was easy to use, showed photos of the rooms, available dates, etc. They accepted a deposit and have a decent cancellation policy, so I figured if I found a better deal elsewhere, we had up until 72 hours prior to arrival to cancel the reservation and get a full refund. When we arrived at the airport, we headed straight over the the Harrah's check-in counter, which is awesome. You can check in right there and avoid lines at the hotels for any of Harrah's properties, except maybe Imperial Palace. It's generally quick and easy. We hit a little snag when trying to pay for the remainder of the week. I completely forgot about the security deposit required at check-in and, unfortunately, the credit card I had planned on using did not have enough credit limit left so, after some help from a patient employee, and a couple calls to American Express, we moved on with the process. It ended up being about a $1200 charge between the remainder of the balance due and the deposit, which we thought may be a little high. It turned out that the deposit was more than the cost of the room, but we were sort of over a barrel there. Anyway, we've always wanted to try that \"tip the guy at the front desk for a better room\" thing. And we did. And he gladly accepted and gave us a room that he said has a great Strip view. Let me start out by saying, I didn't have very high expectations of our room. Honestly, for $59 a night, I was only looking for a clean, comfortable place to sleep a few hours and shower and plan our day. Well, we got to the hotel, got up to our room and planned on waiting for the bellman to bring our luggage and then head out to find some poker. To my dismay, we walked into a room with a great view that was also a smoking room. Ick. When I originally booked, I specified non-smoking, but forgot to mention it to the guy at check-in, so that was my mistake. The bellman got there very quickly and we explained that we needed a non-smoking room and he called down to the front desk and then told us he was moving us to a room on a different floor with the same view. He was very helpful, speedy and friendly. The room we ended up in was pretty much what I expected, it was clean and not very large, but comfortable enough for the time we'd be spending in it. The only thing wrong was the bathtub had a slow drain, which later in the week turned out to be a clog that was cleared by housekeeping. We never even mentioned it as it wasn't that bad, just a bit slow. The view was great; we looked out at Mirage and got to watch the volcano from it. While at Harrah's we dined in their cafe restaurant where the food was pretty good. They had a decent selection, but we stuck mostly with sandwiches, etc. We ate lunch at Toby Keith's I Love This Bar once on a whim on the way to the monorail station at the back of Harrah's, and were truly impressed with the food. We'll probably eat there again. Generous portions and it was very tasty. We ordered room service and they sent up the wrong sandwich the first time and the second sandwich was still prepared incorrectly, so we called and they took it off the bill, but they came back up and demanded the first sandwich back. I guess they thought we were trying to pull a fast one or something. That person was really the only unpleasant one we encountered. I visited the pool almost everyday while my husband slept in, and while it was nothing special, it was cool and clean. It's located on the second floor, so you don't have to go traipsing through the casino to get to it. The drink service was pretty quick and they have a little shop (which I'm sure is common at pools in Vegas) for people like me who forgot the sunscreen. Most days there seemed to be plenty of chairs available, but I found it's best to get there early or you might have to wait a few minutes. Overall, I'd say Harrah's was a pretty good value. Their rooms are adequate for someone just looking for a place to keep their luggage, sleep, shower and make plans. Another plus for their location is the monorail station. You can get up and down the entire Strip using it and it's emissions-free!

We have stayed at the Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Flamingo and Ballys in the past. I have to say that overall, for the price paid, this was our favorite hotel. What impressed us the most about Harrah's was how friendly and helpful the staff was throughout the hotel. From the moment we checked in to the time we left we never experienced a grumpy or indifferent employee. We stayed in an average room, and we certainly aren't high-rollers, but I felt like one all of the time. The room was cleaned promptly every morning and it even had a coffee pot! (I won't even go into how I dragged mine all the way from Wisconsin). We were in a room on the 19th floor, Carnival Tower, with a limited view of the strip. The room did a have a small bar/fridge that we purchased beer/pop from a couple of times. A bottle of beer was $5.00, which I feel is pretty reasonable when you are beat and don't feel like going out to get one. We did ask for a fridge for meds that I like to keep cold, which they brought and set up very quickly. We walked to a small store, right next to Battista's Hole in the Wall restaurant, a couple of times to buy beer, pop, and snacks. The elevators were quick and they had someone checking room keys at night. The pool was nothing fancy, as reported previously, but it was adequate for my needs. The thing I really liked about it was that I could be there quickly from the room, no wandering all over the the hotel to access it. There was a small bar and shop there which I never used. There are a number of restaurants to choose from, but other than going to the buffet for lunch one time we never used them. We had considered trying the Range Steakhouse, but ended up going to Morton's Steakhouse on Flamingo Road instead. (A great choice for a truly wonderful dinner). There were two Starbucks, one on the main level which was always very busy ,and one just up the escalators on the second floor which nobody seemed to notice so it was never busy. The casino was always active and the drink service was very good, especially early morning, which is my favorite time. We didn't win any money there but had a lot of fun playing the Goldfish and Quick Hit machines. We aren't table players so I can't comment on those. Actually, we lost money everywhere this time but even that didn't deter from a great trip. The only thing we would do different next time is to walk over to the Mirage to watch the football games, which my husband really likes to do. The sportsbook was very small and not too comfortable, so when we walked over to the Secret Garden we noticed the Mirage's was huge and very nice, but easy to get to from Harrah's. We didn't rent a car, we rarely do, and had an easy time using the Duece bus a lot. Maybe it was the time of year, September, but this was the first trip that using the Duece wasn't a huge pain in the you-know-what. The drivers were even friendly, maybe they are cleaning up their act?. In closing, we really liked Harrah's and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

There were four of us and we had booked directly with the hotel online. We got in close to midnight on a Thursday and had requested two non-smoking connecting rooms. Hotel check in had a difficult time finding two rooms for us especially, in the same tower and close to each other. They reluctantly upgraded us to a two bedroom suite (normally used for higher rollers) for one night only and told us we had to be out of the room by 11AM. The next morning I called check in and requested 2 connecting, non-smoking rooms preferably, the renovated rooms. I guess plenty of people were checking out that day and they were able to accommodate us, but we had to wait until 2 PM until the rooms were cleaned and available. In the meantime, we had the bell desk retrieve and hold our luggage. The suite was quite spectacular. The bedrooms (1 King & 2 doubles) were connected by a spacious living room. Both bedrooms had good size bathrooms as well. The renovated rooms were nice as well especially, the flat screen TVs - One in the main room and the second in the bathroom. We did have to call the hotel to get the batteries changed on the remote and the lights in the bathroom reset. Both request were taken care of within 15 minutes. We had dinner and lunch at Flavor's buffet, which was standard. I would be wary of the Time Share People wandering the lobby. We were convinced to take a couple of hours out of the day to listen to what they had to offer in exchange for a free dinner (at Paris) and a couple of nights hotel stay. Well, it ended up being about 4 hours long and I would equate it to a similar experience of buying a car. You are only offered coffee, water, popcorn & banana muffins during the entire time.

We flew out of Lansing, Michigan on Allegiant Air at 7:30 a.m. on Friday, September 14th and returned home at 6:30 a.m. on Monday the 17th. We stayed at Harrah's and I had made the reservation through the Allegiant airline as a package. Next time I would call the hotel directly, so I could make requests. The only requests I could make through the airline website when I booked was smoking or non, and 1 or 2 beds. We were able to check in about 9:00, and I asked about a newly renovated room but she said they would be noisy as the band below plays until 3:00 a.m. so we decided against that. I asked for a strip view but she had none available so that was disappointing. We had room #2854 in the Carnaval Tower with 2 queen beds and non-smoking. Nice room and the beds were extremely comfortable. We did have somewhat of a view, although not of the strip, but at least it wasn't the roofs of some other buildings. Nice to see the mountains in the distance. Unfortunately we had a connecting room. TRY TO AVOID THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR NEIGHBORS!! We never heard a sound from the opposite room, but the one with the connecting door you could hear every word they said and every sound they made. I use ear plugs at night so wasn't bothered, but my husband heard them. Also, the first night he heard what he thought to be a pimp and a \"working girl\" outside our room. He was \"explaining\" some things to her in great detail. Again, I had ear plugs in so heard nothing, thankfully. We didn't win anything in the casino. My husband thought the slots were pretty tight as usually you will win a few credits now and then, but these machines just took your money and didn't even say thank you. We went to Toby Keith's \"I Love This Bar\" a couple of times and enjoyed that, and both mornings we had the buffet breakfast for $14.99 each at Flavor's buffet. Very good selection of choices. They should have a restroom inside the restaurant though. You have to leave and go to the back wall on the casino to find one. Harrah's is one of the monorail stops and we took advantage of the $9 all day pass on Saturday and used the monorail several times to get from hotel to hotel. It was fun visiting different hotels and walking around. Most of them had something free to offer (volcano at the Mirage, fountain show at the Bellagio, etc.) and the lobbies were beautiful.

We had received offers through the Total Rewards program in the mail since using our player's card there May 2006, but those offers had expired by December 2006. So, my husband contacted Harrah's this past February and asked what kind of deal we could get, even if we couldn't get two mid-week nights free. They offered us the unbelieveable deal of $40 a night and we scooped it up! So the moral of the story is, it doesn't hurt to call the hotel for any unadvertised hot deals. Be sure to have your Total Rewards card number available if you have one. So, considering what we paid per night, understand that our expectations were quite simple. Upon check-in at 4 PM, we asked about getting a renovated room and were told none were left. The woman wasn't rude, just matter-of-fact about it. We didn't complain, but instead decided to check out the room to see if it was acceptable for what we'd paid. We were pleasantly surprised with our room. We stayed at 752 Carnaval Tower. It was a bit of a walk from the elevator and there wasn't a view (see photos) but we are healthy and don't much care about a view when we spend so little time in the room anyway. The hallways on our way to our room were pleasantly appointed, well-lit and the carpets very clean. And it was so quiet--surprising as the casino was hopping at all times we were there and we understood the hotel to be quite booked. No smoking allowed on this floor either, so the hallway was very fresh smelling. Our room was slightly smaller than a room we'd stayed in at the Aladdin a few years back but decently appointed. It appeared that the furniture was new (although older television with so-so reception and limited channels). The drapes and bedding appeared to be recently updated as well. The carpet was a bit older-looking but very clean. My feet were clean despite walking around on the carpet in my socks one morning. The entryway had a full-length mirror which I appreciated and the flooring there and in the smallish bathroom was marble. Appeared to be new. The bathroom had only one sink but was very clean and shower flowed well with good pressure that you can adjust (waterpik-type nozzle). No tv in this room--but again, I didn't expect to get the best room in the place at the rate we paid. And according to other reviews I've read, we could have gotten much worse. Nothing super-fancy, but pleasantly clean and comfortable. We couldn't hear any noises outside the room, despite our room overlooking the valet/parking garage area which was very busy at times. Speaking of comfortable, the bed was heavenly. I always rave about the Sheraton beds and that nothing can compare, but this room's king-size bed was absolutely wonderful!! Comforter and sheets were immaculate. Our only suggestion about this bed would be to provide larger pillows. These were the tiniest bed pillows I've ever seen. There were three, but I would suggest bringing your own comfy pillow if you are a pillow connoisseur as my husband is. (It didn't bother me after the first night.) Since I prefer to hang most of our clothing-- I ran out of hangers in our room's armoire. We contacted housekeeping and they promptly (within 15 minutes) arrived with an assortment of additional hangers. I was very happy with housekeeping service throughout our stay (we tipped $20 at beginning of vacation and another $10 at end of vacation). As for the rest of Harrah's...we mostly played the slots. We had fun on the Wheel of Fortune quarter slots but didn't win anything. A lady celebrating her 70th birthday there with her extended family did win big two slot machines away from me after only about 5 minutes of play. She won 10,000 credits or $2,500 on the Tabasco quarter slot machine--it's largest payout. It was very exciting to watch someone win and be so surprised/thrilled. I did get the feeling that there wouldn't be any other big winners that week in that section of Harrah's there--but who knows?? I am very nervous about the gaming tables, but since it was our third time in Vegas I felt compelled to at least make the attempt to learn how to play one of the card games. We visited the Party Pit section at Harrah's and sat down at an empty blackjack table with a friendly-looking dealer. My husband and I each purchased $100 in chips and got started. She was very helpful, explaining the basics of the game and I believe that it would have been a pleasant experience had she stayed. However, a few minutes into playing she left and was replaced by a fast-talking smooth kind of dealer who intimidated me. In hindsight, I realize I should have stood up and taken my chips elsewhere but I knew my husband was having fun learning how to play and I didn't want to wimp out. However, minutes later I was feeling overwhelmed and miserable. Every time I wanted to hit or stay he'd intimate that \"the book\" says to do otherwise and get me to go against my gut feeling (again, this was my fault I know), quickly ridding my of most of the chips. I ended up giving the last $20 chips to my husband which he lost as well a bit later. (He seemed pretty easy-going about it, not upset like me.) Did I have fun? Not really. Would I do it again?? Maybe. Next time I would be more confident to go with my gut feeling and to leave when I don't feel comfortable with the dealer or the table. So it was a good lesson, although a bit expensive. (I did win at penny slots twice during the week which made up for the loss--that helps a bit too!!) We purchased coffee at the Starbucks in Harrah's a few times. The cheese danish and croissants were fresh and tasty. Expect a line in the AM and expect to pay through the nose for your java. Not a big deal to us, as we'd saved so much on our room (and airfare). As for the Flavors buffet, we used our comp points that last morning for $8 of our meal and used a buy one/get one free coupon for the rest (received the coupon while out strolling one day). I believe we were at the lunch buffet ($16.99). Good selection of food. Nice carving section especially. I didn't feel poorly a few hours later as some other buffets in Vegas have done to me in the past. Show at Harrah's that we have enjoyed each of our three trips to Las Vegas is The Improv. A reasonably priced evening for sure. I believe it was about $70 for the two of us. All the comedians we've seen there have been very good, some outright side-splitting funny. We didn't take advantage of the Mac King show in the PM, which are the tickets we were offered free (except you'll each have to purchase a drink for $9.95). Heard that it's a family friendly funny show that's at 1 pM and 3PM. We were always busy at those times and didn't get a chance to go. Well, I hope that my review is helpful. I would stay at Harrah's again (especially for the rate we paid!) for it's lexcellent mid-strip location, \"looser \" slots and decent accommodations. We also saw Mystere, Danny Gans and Vinnie Favorito during our stay, all within a few minutes walking distance from our hotel. We also really enjoyed the Margaritaville just south of Harrah's and Flamingo's penny slots. (Another Total Rewards member casino). We dined at The Treasure Island Steakhouse restaurant the evening we saw Mystere, incredible food (at an incredibly high price) but our one splurge meal of our trip--very worth it.

We usually travel to Vegas about once a year and like to stay on \"The Strip\". This hotel caught our eye do to the price and location. It's right in the heart of the action and it's an easy walk to the Mirage, Caesars, Flamingo and many others. It's also very close to Jimmy Buffets, which is one of our favorite hangouts. We aren't bigtime gamblers. Our time is spent drinking a few beers, hanging by the pool and enjoying our friends company. This doesn't mean we don't gamble but it's just not our #1 priority. This is a little info regarding the hotel: We arrived @ the hotel @ 9:00 a.m. on a Friday and was pleasantly surprised that our room was ready along with rooms for the other two couples that came with us. No extra charge for arriving early and our bedding requests were met. Our room was on the 11th floor in the Mardi Gras Tower. Quick elevator service and the hotel hallways and rooms all seemed very clean. Carpets appeared updated and plush. Our room was adequate. Nothing special but it seemed rather dark. Open the blinds and what a view (NOT!). Hello rooftop AC ducts and some other building that I have no idea what it was. Oh Well! who the heck cares about the view? We don't use our room for picture taking. This is a place to lay our heads and feel safe in doing so. This was never an issue. We took advantage of the free safe but didn't use the mini bar. If you don't want to be charged for it don't even look at it. Bed was comfy. Showers were hot and TV worked. Channel selection was weak but again...who comes to Vegas to watch tv? Head down to the pool and just realize this isn't the Hard Rock or Caesars Palace. It's just an average pool with a few cabanas and 2 sun decks. The pool bar was expensive but I'll tell you a little secret......there is a liquor store right next door to the hotel. Just head outside towards the strip to where the bands perform and take the walk around the shops and there it sits. You can buy beer, liquor and snacks and it will save you a ton of money. When you walk outside towards the strip you want to head left towards Imperial Palace. If you go right towards The Wynn you will not find a store for atleast a mile. If you like to hang out and hear some decent entertainment head over to the pavilion bar. This is a cool little spot with awesome bartenders and local acts that are aware that they aren't ever going to be on Billboard's Hot 100. You can get within touching distance of them. They are very crowd friendly and often speak to the patrons asking for suggestions or requests. Get there early on Friday or Saturday nights and you'll avoid the cover charge that comes later in the evening. The casino floor is very large and a bit Old School. Harrah's looks to cater towards a slightly older crowd but does have a cool gaming area called the \"Party Pit\". This is where we played and it isn't because we think we are cool. The dealers on these tables are there to have a good time and help you succeed. In my experience, losing money to a friendly dealer is always more pleasurable than losing it to some stiff. If you fall within this line try the Party Pit. We didn't win much but we had a great time. Overall, we thought Harrah's was a great value. You have a lot of choices in Vegas but if you just want a nice place to chill out and relax then Harrah's will be perfect. If you want pampered and need a young hip scene then this place probably isn't for you. We'd certainly stay here again.

The first night we were on the 3 rd floor in the MG tower with plans to move the following day. Take note, the water pressure is excellent down there. Our room had a patio adjacent to the sun deck. You can hear some music from the pool but it wasn't enough to bother us. Our friends room was way down and accross the hall had no view much less a deck. The window was totally blocked by AC equipment. When I return I will ask for a patio room. We moved to the 12th floor in MG tower. It was basically the same room (not the renovated rooms but still nice). We had a view of the strip and the volcano and were much closer to our friends. The down side was the lack of water pressure. We really enjoyed the Carnival Bar during the day. It was a little too hip for us in the evening. The dueling piano bar was great and we loved the bands at Toby Keiths place. We also enjoyed a band at Margaritaville. The only place we ate at Harrahs was Toby Keiths, it's a little pricey but we the food was good. We had a breakfast at Ellis Island. The price was right but had to wait. It's a little dark and the service wasn't great. Afterward we walked to 7-11 and bought bottles of water for .79 to last the duration of our trip. If you cut through Ballys it's not a bad walk. Harrahs was just our speed. The price was great, we booked on the hot deals on their website, averaging to $80.00 per night. The rooms are nothing special but clean and the location cannot be beat. We liked the size of the casino, it wasn't hard to find eachother.

I think a couple slots and that was it. People told me the outdoor area with the bartenders was really cool, but we never got to check it out. Also I heard Toby Keith's bar and The Range Steakhouse were pretty good restaurants, but did not check them out either. I definitely suggest this hotel...especially if you want a suite. I did not get to see the standard rooms, but I am sure they are nice as well. Our rooms' view was pretty nice too of the Mirage and mountains. I would for sure stay here again. Also for a good Italian place to eat..just around the corner behind Bally's in the back of the strip is a great restaurant called Battista's Hole in the Wall Italian. You get huge portions of pasta,salad or soup,garlic bread and a cappucino at the end all for a great price!!

My plane from Detroit was delayed for two hour so I did not arrive to the hotel until 1:00am Tuesday. Since I had little time in Las Vegas, after checking in which went very smoothly, I went to my room and unpacked. The room was clean and I especially like the armorie that was centered between the two beds. My original request was for a king bed, but arriving at the time I did I expected I wouldn't get a king bed. The clerk who was friendly advised me to check later in the day to see if a king bed room would be available. I had a great view of the Mirage Casino and the volcano so I decided I would just keep the room I had. I went walking down to the Fashion Mall and back to Harrahs. There was hardly anyone out at about 2:00am. However, when I went to the Carnival Court there was a DJ playing and the crowd were in there 20's. I hadn't eaten and was very hungry so I went back into Harrahs and at that time the Oyster Bar was open for food. It did take approximately 40 minutes for me to get a turkey club and fries. However, I watched the cooks/chefs prepare varioius subs and burgers, breakfast items while fresh so I didn't mind the wait and the other patrons didn't seem to mind either. During my stay I didn't spend a lot of time gambling at Harrahs so I didn't have much interaction with the employees. I did appear to me that the employees were assisting others well. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the Duel Piano Bar that had a pretty good crowd each night. The gaming area at first had me in circles, but when you figure out the the plastic figures of the man and woman holding money is the area of the hotel, to the left leds to the court area and the rights towards Ceasers and other hotels. I had a great time my short stay in Vegas and will definitely visit there again, soon I hope. I walked the strip one day towards the Riveria and the next day down to Mandelay Bay. My feet were sore. Tips: The Rio buffet was well worth it, lots of stations. For shows I suggest checking with Tickets4tonite or Tickets2nite (the one that has more locations has more discount tickets!)

I like Harrah\u2019s location, but getting to the front desk from Las Vegas Boulevard is a pain in the butt if you don\u2019t know some of the short cuts. You drive down and around a bunch alleyways riddled with speed bumps until you finally reach their valet parking area. It\u2019s rather small and don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re stuck waiting in line for 15-20 minutes until you can finally hand your keys over to the parking attendant. I recently attained \u201cplatinum\u201d status and was looking forward to finally reaping some of the benefits, i.e. dedicated check-in for platinum club members. Unfortunately the platinum reception desk was closed with a note stating that one could obtain service in the diamond club reception area \u2013 ummmmm, does the phrase \u201cturn around stupid\u201d mean anything? I didn\u2019t turn around and roamed around a bit before giving up and heading for the main front desk with my platinum card in hand hoping for some sort of upgrade. The staff was friendly enough, and I was advised that the hotel was booked and instead of a king/non-smoking room, they had a queen/non-smoking room. I figured I wouldn\u2019t be spending much time in the room so it was no big deal. I know many people hate having the long walk from their room to/from the elevator, but it\u2019s never bothered me as I find it to be a bit quieter due to the limited amount of foot traffic passing by my door. My room was located on the seventh floor and I found it to be clean, but rather small. The view was primarily of another rooftop, but had I been a bit higher I may have had more of a promising view. Again, not a big deal for a two night stay. As I mentioned, the room was rather small \u2013 for me it was fine, but for two people it may be an issue. The furniture wasn\u2019t in bad shape and the bed was rather comfy. The bathroom was clean, but someone did a crummy grout job in the tub and it looked worse than it really was. The housecleaning staff was friendly and cleaned my room on a timely basis. I always try to give the buffet\u2019s a try and Harrah\u2019s wasn\u2019t too bad. I only tried it for breakfast so I have no idea what their lunch and dinner buffet\u2019s are like. There\u2019s a caf\u00e9 not too far from the buffet which was packed most of the time \u2013 I take that as a good sign.

Got an offer in the mail for 2 free nights and a free leather jacket at check in---couldn't pass that one up! Already had 4 nights free at the Nugget starting on Saturday so we booked Harrah's for Sunday and Monday and hopped back and forth. Check in at Harrah's was great, were offered an upgrade to a suite for $50 but passed seeing as we're seldom in our room anyway. Got our jacket just as they promised and it's a pretty nice one. Thought there'd be a catch but there wasn't. Our room was in the Carnival tower and yes it is a long walk to the rooms but all of the staff is so friendly and helpful that we didn't really mind. Anybody who's been to the strip knows it's a long walk to anything, which is why we usually stay downtown at the Nugget (won't anymore--see review at Nugget site). Our room was very quiet, tho other reviews have said the opposite. Room had a special heating/cooling system that you can set when you're in the room. It ahs a sensor that detects when you've left the room and lowers or raises the room temperature automatically according to the season to conserve energy. Pretty slick---no noisy fans blowing. The rooms in our towere all have minibars and ours hummed constantly but I kind of liked the \"white noise\". Our room had 2 queen beds that were very comfy as well as a table and chairs, bath was nice size and all was clean. We ate at the buffet twice, once for supper and once for breakfast---food was excellent both times---huge selection and great staff--both times there was a players club rep at the buffet line offering coupons and gifts for signing up for a player's card. Hubbie already had one so I signed up and got $15.00 in coupons for the buffet that night. I play penny slots and the service in the slot areas is fantastic---spoke with one of the managers and complimented him on the speed and friendliness of slot staff and beverage servers---they not only show up at your machine promptly (2 minutes) but they also introduce themselves and offer to help if you need anything else. Once when I hit the service light (for change) the slot manager came and was on his headset asking if the light on my machine had registered with the staff. They all wear headsets and get a signal when a service light is activated on a machine and they literally come running. The manager told me they don't have fountains, they have people. Their customer service training shows---great staff throughout the facility. The only problem we had with Harrah's was the comp system. Doesn't matter if you play tables or slots---you use the same card and accrue points towards comps. Gone are the days when you could play blackjack for a few hours and ask for a buffet or dinner comp. It all goes on the card and the credits are meager. Hubbie played blackjack off and on for 2 days while I played penny slots. He plays $100 per hand, sometimes more, and at the end of our stay I had more comps than he did---$24 for me and $9.52 for him. We used the credit to pay for the meal we charged to our room. I think we'd stay there again if the rooms were comped but we'd probably gamble where the table players are more appreciated. The casinos all seem to hand out comp rooms like candy, as long as you've used a player's card so there's really nothing special about getting those offers in the mail. How we're treated when we get there is what matters to us. Golden Nugget has gotten very tight with their comps as well. After both of us playing there for 3 days we had NO comp credits built up---not even enough for one meal. Hubbie played blackjack for one hour at the Las Vegas Club and they gave him a $20 meal comp (and they have good cafe food at the Upper Deck, with great staff). The smaller casinos seem more generous with the comps, more interested in keeping you there. The free shuttle to the Rio is nice, of course they're owned by the same company, as well as Caesar's, Bally's, Horseshoe, Flamingo and some others. So if you have a card and play at any of them it all adds up. Use your card! Charge your meals to your room and when you check out ask them to swipe your player's card and whatever credits you've earned can be credited towards your room bill. The credits are only good from the first of the year thru the end of the year so if you only go to Vegas once a year you'll lose them if you don't use them.

The first two nights were fairly good, but the third morning there was construction either right above us or in the elevator and they were hammering for hours. The fourth morning we were woken up by the talking in the next room. We could hear every word! The casino was a nice size and it didn't take long to learn how to navigate around. Waiters/waitresses were quick and polite. The piano bar was a blast and we enjoyed that very much. We ate at Toby Keith's and the wings and ribs were very good. Overall, the service, room, and casino were good, but we would not stay there again because we require a quiet room.", "Date": "December 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cHarrahs a good value\u201d", "Author": "jatillin", "ReviewID": "UR6352707", "Content": "Stayed at Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas 11/30-12/4. We used our players card points to get a discount that worked out to an average of $60/night. Had read several reviews about dirty rooms and outside noise issues. We were pleasantly surprised that we had neither problem. Our first room was in the Marti Gras tower. Despite our request for rollaway bed, the room was far too small for that. Plus the A/C unit was running like a diesel on its last leg. We went back to the front desk and were placed in the Carnival tower 16th floor. Room was updated and well appointed. Only issue was a lack of soap, shampoo or lotion in the room, which one call to housekeeping rectified. Two queen beds were comfortable, as was the rollaway (which was a little short for my 6\u20191 brother, but otherwise OK). We had a handicap room (supposedly because of the extra space) which was fine except the shower was very low on water pressure. The casino was clean, if a little smokey. This may have been caused in part by the 10,000 rodeo fans that had swarmed to Vegas this particular week. Dealers were personable and helpful. Pit bosses were particularly good, making a point to dole out charm and helpful advice. The winner for the weekend was Pricilla who dealt Casino Texas Holdem (play against the house, not each other). Finding a cocktail waitress was sometimes a chore and the waits for drinks could be long, so when the first one arrives, order another on the spot just to be safe. Call liquors were no problem, but remember to name your brand or you get the house rotgut. The restaurants were less impressive. We ate at the Range Steakhouse and were unimpressed. The $42 ribeye steak was up to its billing as prime beef well cooked, but the service was only fair. The vegetables were particularly disappointing. We ordered creamed spinach for the table (usually a steak house staple) and received a bowl of gooey cream sauce with a pitiful amount of spinach (my brother returned from the restroom to see it and asked who ordered soup). It was also salted to the point on inedibility. We returned it for the saut\u00e9ed red potatoes and were only marginally happier with the bitter oily flavor they sported. The Oyster bar served better fare. The crab cakes and Louisiana chicken nugget salad were winners. The Italian place next to it was also above average. Excellent bruchetta with pesto, good crusty bread, good service were all there. All three entrees (two beef and one chicken) were well done. The Spa at Harrah\u2019s was a little disappointing. After staying at Rio, Luxor and Monte Carlo on prior visits, this was a small and unimpressive cousin. The masseuse was acceptable if a little older than I would have liked. The upside was the shower. The spa was right by the Carnival elevators on the 4th floor, so I used the shower in the spa instead of suffering in the no pressure room shower. Fairly convenient to reach and excellent water and space. On a side note, if you forget toiletries, DON\u2019T buy the junk in the minibar. The Spa has toothbrushes, razors, shaving cream, and hair gel available. Locker space was tight, so be prepared just to camp out on a bench. Bottled water on the house at The Spa, so a good place to grab a few for the room since the Vegas tap water is awful. For a Spa with no access fee, it was not a bad deal. The location on the strip is perhaps the best feature of Harrah's. Easy access to Mirage, Bally's and Paris. Plus two of the lower level casino's are right next door, so if you want to go upscale to Paris or play $3 craps at the blue collar casino, all three are an easy walk. There is also in house access to the monorail which runs up and down the strip. Other notes from the visit: The buffet at Wynn was a treat. We had Friday lunch there and were extremely impressed. Great quality for around $25/head. Asian restaurant at MGM was also a winner, but pricey. Spearmint Rhino well worth the high cover and drink prices.", "Date": "December 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tasmania", "Title": "\u201cOk\u201d", "Author": "portabello", "ReviewID": "UR6163133", "Content": "When arriving at midnight, after a long flight all you want to do is get to your room.

This was wonderful so we booked a 5 night stay from Oct. 29 to Nov. 3rd. knowing we would have to pay for the 5th night but of course that was no problem. When we checked in we were thrilled to be upgraded to a junior suite at no additional charge. Then, on our fifth day we were told that we should have been checked out. I told the front desk that they were mistaken, that we had a 5 night stay reserved. We fully expected to pay for that evening and we wanted to keep the room. They were not sure that we could do that and connected me with VIP services. The young lady was wonderful! After hearing what had happened she told us that not only could we remain in the room but she would pick up the cost! The next day when we checked out, we met her again and she also went out of her way to get as many room charges taken care of that she could. Our entire stay for 5 nights including breakfasts and dinners (one at the Range Steakhouse) cost us out of our pockets a measly $40.00. You just can't beat that! We have been to Harrahs Las Vegas many times. All the reviews are correct in their own way. Yes, the property is old but I think it is well cared for. The room is clean and if you should need anything housekeeping is more than happy to help you. We had a junior suite and it was adequate. This is not a glitzy fancy property but a great casual, kick your shoes off kind of place for people who like to gamble and it is located at the best part of the Strip. What I think is the best part of Harrahs in Vegas is the customer service and how well they treat their guests. The casino is a fun casino and like any other casino is good or bad based on your individual luck. The worst thing about it I would say is the food quality (except for the Range).

Arrived Sunday May 1st about 9:30 am and went directly to front desk to register. Very short line only waited about 5 minutes. Lady at check-in desk was extremely friendly. She originally said our room was located in Madri Gra tower. I asked for the Carnvial tower and she said no problem. I did not realize there was a difference in towers until I read reviews. Understand Carnival tower has been recently remodeled. We did get our room immediately , did not have to wait for check-in time which was 4 pm. Room was very large and everything was clean. The only problem was no coffee maker and for me this is a very big problem. Have to have my caffeine as soon as feet hit floor or my day is ruined. Had to walk to Walgreen's down the strip by MGM. Very hot day and was extremely tired. On the way back stopped at Alladin to rest for a while. Of course left there lighter in pocket book. My husband plays Keno and some slots, I only play slots. No luck except little pay offs the entire trip. One day going hit the big one. Had a wonderful trip. There are no frills at Harrahs just the basics which is okay since we only go to room to sleep for a few hours anyway. The only problem was the mattress was very uncomfortable, very hard. Remember to ask for a room not facing the band or you will be listening to loud music all night. This happened one year when we asked for a strip view. Never again, even with pillow over my head could still hear the very, very loud music. Keep us awake most of night. We should have asked to be moved to another room but didn't get around to it. We saw the new Wynn which is very impressive. Also took bus to Orleans. It was okay but wouldn't want to stay there because of location. Ate at buffet there, it was very good. Try to see new casino's ever year. Next year want to try Palace Station and Hard Rock. Have no desire to go to Hooters. By the way we did stay at Harrah's for 5 nights for $250, gamblers rate. Ate at Harrahs buffet a few times and the coffee shop first night. Food was very good at both restaurants. Comps are really down from what we use to receive. Only ate at buffet twice free. We use to eat the entire week free and couple nights the room were comped. Vegas is getting to be very high class. Wonder what is going to happen to middle class casino's.

Unfortunately, we couldn't use the hotel check in at the airport because it was too late and they had closed. Had no problems checking in and was given a room in the Carnival Tower like we requested. The room itself was good, considering what we had paid for it. I had stayed at the Flammingo a few months earlier and I would say that room was better than the one at Harrah's. The beds were a little uncomfortable (firm) and the pillows seemed to be pretty old. The bathroom was decent sized and clean, no mildew smell. The ring around the shower head was loose and needed to be reattached to the tile but other than that the shower was fine. Not much water pressure in the sink and the water smelled like sulfer so drinking it was an act of desperation. No safe in the room, which I've seen some people complain about before, but it didn't bother us. Use common sense and if you have anything that needs to be in a safe there are safety deposit boxes in the lobby of the hotel. Coffee make worked great, as did the TV. The best part about starying at Harrah's was the location. Most of my trips to Vegas, I've stayed furhter south on the strip and it was nice to get a change. I've done all the sight seeing in Vegas, so walking up and down the strip doesn't appeal too much anymore. I liked that I had some casino's around me that I hadn't spent a lot of time at in the past. Like, I said the location is definatly the highlight of this resort. We didn't make it to the pool, but we could see it from our room. It got pretty busy during the day and it didn't look too big from where we were at. I've seen better pools in Vegas, but I've also seen worse. We ate breakfast one morning at the Flavors buffett and it was great! I would recommend it to anyone and it wasn't terrribly expensive either. The food was high quality and the selection was huge. The only issue I had was we requested a late check out because our flight didn't leave until midnight and the best they could do was noon. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to have access to our room for the afternoon so we could have used the pool and had a place to shower and change before we left.

After reading the reviews I has no expectations tohis property. I knew from previous visits where it was located, so I was excited just to be in the middle of ALL the action. So, here goes my review. Upon arrival at airport approximately 230pm, the Hotel checkin at airport was VERY LONG. It spread all the way to beginning of baggage claim so, I opted to checkin at hotel, and Boy was this alot better. Got to hotel and there was only 3 ppl in line at 3pm ..very Fast check-in..Once i got to hotel, checkin to hotel room 10 minutes top. I booked a great deal with total rewards card $80 night for 3 nights, and I got just the room i expected. I did not ask for an upgrade, the deskperson asked if i wanted 1 or 2 beds and i chose 1, after a brief computer look-up i got rom 442 in the mardi gras tower. when i got to room it was just as expected. A regular Hotel room. Basic furnishings, wet bar, armoire w/ironing board, and Bathroom. I checked and sheets were clean and linens were clean too. TV channels are scarce, but do you really watch alot of TV in Vegas. I only needed room to sleep and shower. Did here a little noise in halls but overall not too bad. My room overloooked the Air conditioning unit as you will see in my photos. On my last night, new people checked in next door and they were very loud thru connecting door. no much noise proofing. The casino is Just like all the ohers. Smokey, loud, but thats is fun. Th drink service was Very good. The cocktailers were around every few minutes so I did not have to wait at all, every day i played. IMHO I thought the buffet was excellent for the money. I started with Sushi and Sweet and sour chicken, Then i had Crab legs w/fried shrimp and scallops. after that course I had Prime rib with Horeradish sauce and corn on the cob, and finally for dessert i had Creme Brulee and bread pudding. Excellent value at 19.99. I also ate at the cafe around 10pm one night and Marble rye patty melt was excellent. Finally slots were very tight. I saw 1 winner, Laady playing .25 slots. she was playing .75 a pull and won $225 1 pull then 5pulls later won $932. I just laughed as I was losing pull after pull. The Dualing Pianos and carnaval Bar are very nice. The Twins were Great and The outside bar was Hopping every night.

Our first night was spent listening to the drone of some very loud music coming from the pool area. This lasted until 3:00 am. Of course the next day we changed to a different room in a different tower that was much quieter. Remember that there are 2 towers, The Mardi Gras, which is older, and The Carnival, which has larger rooms. A big problem at Harrah's is lack of affordable food options having no food courts. To have even a simple breakfast costs you dearly, especially at the coffee shop. Aside for the high prices, the service was horrible. We had to wait in a long line and even after we were seated it took forever to be served our food. This happened more than once so we ended up eating most of our meals outside the hotel. This was not so much a problem for us having rented a car but I could see this being a hassle if one were to stay strictly at the hotel. Now for the positive. Our dinner at \"The Range Steak House\" was superb and the service outstanding. One of the best steakhouses in Vegas...and we've been to a lot.

Hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I became ill in the casino and help was there within minutes, providing professional attention, advising me of my options and not leaving my side until they were sure I had recovered. Management followed up the next day by telephone, and the security chief himself located me in the casino later that night and asked me how I was doing. I was very impressed and made to feel more like a person than just a guest/player. Our room on the 16th floor of the Carnaval Tower was immaculate and comfortable, with plenty of room to move around, a decent supply of towels and a partial strip view. (Unless you're traveling over the strip by airplane, standing on top of the statue at the Venetian, or are an extremely high roller, a partial strip view is the best you can hope for; besides, a clean, comfortable and safe place to sleep is far more important than the view.) Amenities included an in-room safe, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, clock radio, desk, table and chairs, mini-refreshment bar and fridge, low-end lotion, soap and shampoo, full-length mirror, television and telephone with voice mail, nice plumpy pillows (extras in the closet) and a comfortable bed. Temperatures were comfortable. The bathroom was roomy. Security is visible in the casino and in the hotel, \"privacy please\" signs are respected, and the room was very quiet. Even when other rooms were being cleaned, I never heard any noise. Corridors are wide and well-lit, and the elevator arrived right away. Harrah's is right smack in the middle of the strip, and the cool March weather made walking long distances a pleasure, although it was a bit windy. A jacket, hoodie or sweater is a must in the early morning and after sundown at this time of year. Buy decent souvenir tee shirts and fleeces at Casino Royale next door ($5 for the tees, $10 for the fleeces). There are plenty of fair-priced restaurants nearby, including a Denny's where you can carbo-load for next to nothing and not feel hungry until dinner time. We ate twice at The Cafe at the hotel (one dinner, one breakfast) and found the food plentiful, good and decently-priced - $11.99 for a respectable prime rib, potato and vegetable, served with warm rolls. Service was a tad slow at dinner, but the waiter apologized for the delay. There was a line at breakfast time, but once seated, service was quick and the food was hot and good. I'm mainly a slot player and found plenty of machines of all denominations and types to play on. Harrah's Carnaval Court is a fun place to visit; although it's mainly a shopping plaza, there is live music and entertaining bartenders at night, and the crowd always seems to be having a good time. Harrah's free shuttle to its sister property, the Rio, comes every twenty minutes or so. Plan on taking it for the free show, which includes clowns and mimes who engage the audience and toss mardi gras beads, a short stage revue, and the magnificent overhead floats. We had dinner at the Twisted Kilt there, more a pub/bar than a restaurant and a bit noisy, but with interesting food and very affordable. At the moment, it seems that Vegas is \"under construction.\" There are hotels, vacation properties and condos going up all over the place. Because of that, you will sometimes find your walking areas are narrow, but foot traffic flows smoothly. Road traffic is a different story; Las Vegas Boulevard ALWAYS seems congested, and you can make better time on foot if you're touring the strip than you can in a car. Make sure to observe walk/don't walk signs, though, because vehicles proceed as soon as their signal turns green. There are a number of pedestrian walkways which will take you over the roadways; in some cases, they are the only way to get across the street, and you can use them to get great views of the strip and orient yourself. In spite of the construction and the traffic, though, Vegas is noticeably clean. Be aware that everything is further away than it looks. Ditch the heels and thongs in favor of comfortable walking shoes. The public bus comes quickly and for $2 and about twenty minutes of your time, you can ride all the way downtown to Fremont Street for a taste of old Vegas refined. Make sure to visit some of the smaller casinos there, as well as the flashier establishments like the Golden Nugget; the little places have a charm all their own. The double-decker buses can get crowded and you may have to stand, but they're clean and pleasant to ride in, and a bus ride is a great way to see the whole strip and the area that lies between it and downtown. The bus makes stops at all the hotels from the Stratosphere to New York New York. Harrah's has a monorail stop, as well, as do several hotels; all are clearly marked. Time share sellers are all over Vegas, but all you need to say is no, thanks (or nothing at all); they don't hound you if you make it clear you're not interested. You'll also encounter a large number of people hawking girls for sale; these folks stand in groups on the sidewalk and snap their literature to get the attention of every guy who passes, even if they have to reach across his spouse or girlfriend to do it. Once again, you need only walk past them. It's true they can be annoying, but it's all a part of the cachet of the town. During the day at MGM Grand, you can catch a glimpse of lions descended from Leo the Lion (of MGM movie logo fame) as they play with their trainers in a specially-designed habitat before being returned to the ranch where they live. At night, be sure to take in the free entertainment. Cross the street to the Mirage to see the volcano, which goes off every hour, or walk down to the Bellagio to see the dancing waters; they \"perform\" every fifteen minutes or so. Stay to watch more than one show, since they are synched to a different song every time. Ooohs and Aaaahs are guaranteed. You can secure half-price tickets for same-day shows at the nearby outlets; you may not get the best seats, or even the best shows, but you'll certainly be entertained. Jimmy Buffet's Margheritaville also has a short live show which you can enjoy while you sip their signature drinks or dive into an astounding-sized plate of Volcano Nachos so immense you won't be able to finish it before your entree arrives.

Last stay was at the Tropicana and although the pool area at the Trop is nice, the rooms are a little tattered. Not a problem at Harrah's. Everything is well maintained and it has a very relaxed feel. You can walk and watch at Venetian, Caesars, Mirage, Bellagio, Wynn, Paris and others, but if you want a nice comfortable place to rest and relax, I recommend Harrah's.

Check in was a breeze, our room wasn't quite ready but we checked our luggage & headed for the casino. The machines were pretty tight this time. We ended up on the 27th floor with a great view of Caesars & Bellagio and the mountains to the west. We've stayed at Harrahs' several times in the past & love it's location. The Carnival Court is a real fun time. We ordered drinks & appetizers & charged everything to our room. We tried the buffet called Flavors for lunch and would highly recommend it. There is such a wide variety of foods you couldn't go away hungry. The dessert selection is very good too. They even have several flavors of ice cream and you can build your own sundae or have a waffle cone. We also charged this lunch to our room. The reason to charge things to your room can be very benefical because as you use your Total Rewards cards in the slots (or at the table games) you can build up comps. We ended up getting our 3 nights for free and also our meals free. Oh - also charged a breakfast in the newly remodeled cafe one morning. When we checked out, our bill was only $3. It pays to use your card. The only drawback I can say is that several of the slot machines need to be replaced. It bothered me that many had cracked glass and the reels were so faded - I love to see all the vibrant colors, sometimes that's what draws me to a machine. They really needed an overhaul or just get new machines. Several of the stools by the machines were very dirty and had cigarette holes in them - not very appealing to sit down. Check out was very easy - no line at 1pm on Friday afternoon. Overall, Harrahs is a great place to stay, if they could just get some new slot machines! Oh, one more thing - pay the price $9 (but can get $2 off discount) to go up to the observation area of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The view is spectacular at night! Lights as far as you can see. The fountains at Bellagio take on a whole new perspective from that height. So does the helicopter flying down the strip at your eye level!

Check-in seemed to go fine, we parked our car in their garage, hauled all our luggage up to our room and... the key card wouldn't work! Very annoyed we kept trying but had no luck. I walked down the hall towards the elevator and was getting ready to call the front desk when a bell boy came down the hall. I told him we had just checked in and our card wasn't working. He said 'aw man, I hope it's not the battery' checked our paperwork that showed the room we were in, used his card to let us in and told us to just let the front desk know our cards weren't working, they must not of been activated properly. So we proceded to get ourselves all settled in, unpacked some of our toiletries, used the restroom, and hung out for awhile looking at brochures and relaxing. We were in there probably 30 mins and decided it was time to 'hit the strip'. But first we need to stop by the desk and get our cards activated, no big deal right? WRONG!!! We told the man at the desk the situation and that our key wouldn't work and he asked to see my paperwork and ID which I gave to him, and he asked if the room was in my name and I said yes. He then took out this little purple strip of paper that was in the folder with the room key and asked if we knew the womans name that was on it. We said no and we had no idea what that paper was even for and I thought the womans name on it was the lady that checked me in. He explained that no it should of been my name on it and it was very strange but somehow when I checked in I was handed the wrong paper. That was why our key wouldn't work is because we were going to the wrong room. We explained that we went to the room we were told to go to and how were we to know any different! After asking us if we had been in the room long and if we had touched much and we said yes we had laid on the beds and used the restroom, he still made us move to a different room! He said he was sorry but the room we went to was registered to the lady who's name was on the paperwork and we were supposed to be in room xxx so we were going to have to move! Not only that but because it was a 'security issue' security would have to open the room for us and we had to identify our luggage before we could get it. So he called security and told them to meet us up there, gave us corrct paperwork, apologized again, etc. We hurried back up to our original room assuming security would already be there, but no one was in sight. By now our patience was extremely thin and I found it inexcuseable to have to wait for security, I picked up the house phone in the hall and angrily explained the situation and was put on hold, then security finally decided to saunter on up so I hung up. Security proceeded to watch our every move while we gathered our belongings making us feel practically like criminals. The one guy thought it was very weird we had to move to another room and told us to talk to the manager cause it wasn't right how we were treated. We agreed so we did stop by the managers desk where he apologized and comped our first night's stay. Now all that would of been good and fine if the rest of our stay had gone well, the one night free did go a long way towards making up for all our aggravation although it still stunk to start our night off with such a bad start. However we continued to have a bad experience at this hotel! The first morning there we had just got up and my sister was taking a shower when suddenly this very loud, obnoxious alarm goes off. I called the front desk and told them there was this hideous alarm going off and she asked if we were smoking and I said no and she said she'd look into it. Then we opened the door and there was a maid in the room across from us and she said everything is fine it's nothing to worry about. Ok well that's good to know, however it still took them a good 10 minutes to turn the blasted thing off, it was horrible! Later that day we came back to our room in the afternoon to relax for a little while and I went to get some ice to drink ice water and their ice machine was broken! It may seem like a minor thing but it was just one more irritation. Then to top it all off you would expect after such a bad stay to at least get good cutoomer service while checking out, but oh no not at Harrah's! I was all prepared to compain about everything that went wrong but when the woman checking us out asked how our stay was and I replied 'not very good' she just said 'oh, not very good huh'. I couldn't believe it! A normal response would of been oh I'm so sorry what was the problem? not 'oh not very good'! Then when I got my receipt I couldn't tell what had been charged to my card so I said 'can I get a total on here' and she snapped at me 'it's right there plain as day!' Well no, it was not! It had a charge with a minus sign, a room charge, the buffet we ate at Rio and then another charge with a minus sign. At the bottom where it said total it said zero. There was no total on the bill! I wanted to make darn sure the bill was correct and our one night had been comped so I went over to the manager again but he was busy with another customer. So finally another guy asked if he could help us and he explained our bill but when I said the lady checking us out had been rude he didn't respond so we just got the heck out of there!

We used a promo code that offered 2 nights free. When making the reservation we looked into the rate for the 1st night, Feb 11th a Saturday, however it was $139 which was more than we were wanting to spend, so we booked at the MGM for a promo rate of $59 for just one night. When we checked in I asked for the Mardi Gras tower as I had heard that it was a little nicer than the Carnival tower. The lady said no that the Carnival tower was better, so we went with the Carnival tower. We actually liked Harrahs better than MGM. We liked the smaller hotel/casino. The rooms at Harrahs were just as nice as MGM, but maybe a little smaller but not a problem for us. When we checked in we ask for a room with a view, however they didn't really have one. Perhaps it was because we were getting the room for free, not sure. But it was OK. Unfortunately, I got sick the first night at Harrahs. The next day, Monday, I spent all day in bed with the flu and bronchitis. Lets just say this is the most I have stayed in bed in Vegas! But the bed was comfortable and the shower felt great. We had made reservations at Battista's for Monday night to celebrate Valentines Day, however, we had to cancel since I was sick. This was very disappointing as I was looking forward to it. Sunday night, before I got sick, we ate at Toby Keith's Bar & Grill. I had Nacho's and my husband had chicken fried steak. His was good but I didn't care for my nacho's. Meat tasted like it had taco seasoning sprinkled on it. But we did enjoy the live house band. The dancing is what brought on the bronchitis. :( The only problem that I can say that was only a minor problem was that the lighting in the bathroom was a low yellowish light. Not bright enough. Other than that, I have no complaints. We ordered room service one night, I was not hungry but my husband ordered a hamburger. He said it was very good. I just had a bowl of fresh fruit. I think the cost of the hamburger was $7.99 including fries. There is a refreshment center cabinet in the room and the stuff inside is expensive. M & M's, peanuts, crackers, coke's, etc. My husband took one item out, a bag of peanuts in the shell, just to look at them and then put them back. When we got ready to check out, we noticed there was a $7 charge on the bill. We called to the front desk and told them we took the item out but then put it back in. So they took it off the bill without a problem. So it is touch sensitive. Not everything in it is $7 though. Some less, not sure how much though because the brochure that is suppose to be posted was not, I had just ask about the prices at the front desk. The parking garage was easy to get to and of course it was free. Check-in and out was easy and no lines to speak of. Friendly service too! The slots weren't paying out too well, but then who's are? We didn't enjoy our stay at Harrahs only because I was sick. But we will go back and stay at Harrahs again. Even if it's not free. But I wouldn't pay more than like $79-89 a night. Location is great!

The location on the strip cannot be beat and the staff were very friendly and helpful despite the busy time of the holidays. We checked in and got two non-smoking rooms in the newly remodeled Carnival Tower. I was a bit lost at first, and a staff member personally escorted me to the correct elevators. The rooms did not adjoin, but as someone said earlier, the walls are paper thin so you can really hear what\u2019s going on next door. Since we were family it was ok, but I can imagine the inconvenience if you have rowdy neighbors. Also, the TV was a Zenith from the Ice Age. It barely worked and made a buzzing noise the whole time. I didn't bother calling the front desk, but it made me wonder about their recent \"renovation\". The room didn\u2019t have the bells and whistles of other hotels on the strip, but the central location makes it worth staying there. I highly recommend The Caf\u00e9 at Harrah\u2019s. It has reasonably priced, tasty comfort food 24 hrs. a day like pizza, burgers, soups & salads. The newly renovated buffet called Flavors had its grand opening when we were there, but the prices were quite high. Breakfast starts at $12.99 and dinner is a whopping $18.99. There were no coupons or discounts floating around. In fact, upon check in, the only buffet coupons we got were for Rio and the Flamingo. Another plus about Harrah\u2019s is that the Monorail stops there. For about $20, an all day pass gives you unlimited trips up and down the strip. Also, the Carnival Court outside has a small marketplace and is home to the Ghiradelli Ice Cream Parlour which is our favorite. We also had comped tickets to Clint Holmes. The theater was seedier than I expected, and initially we weren\u2019t seated together since the show was \u201csold out\u201d. Luckily, there were lots of open seats and we managed to get a table together. The casino was very tight and I didn\u2019t win much on the slots 25c and $1 slots, but I saw at least two people hit on the Blazing 777 slots and win $1500. The casino is always packed and touted as \u201cBest Slots in Vegas\u201d although my experience was very different. At the Venetian next door I won $450 on the Blazing 777\u2019s and also won $100 at Wynn. So all in all, Harrah\u2019s was a nice place to stay, but not gamble. One final annoyance is the Fairfield Resort desk and showroom on the 2nd floor. You pass by it to go to the garage and Monorail. Pesky salespeople flaunt show-tickets and other free stuff to entice you to take tour of the Grand Desert Timeshare. It\u2019s not worth the 2 hours of torture to get a free dinner, because the sales people are so pushy and grill you for information.

The TV offered only a dozen (mostly local) channels, but plenty of advertisements for Harrah's facilities. The bedside clock radio was inoperable. Not only was the room without a micro/fridge, there was neither in-room coffee nor daily newspaper. Second, Harrah's food services were disappointing. The continental breakfast in the business center was attractive, but limited. Two meals (one breakfast, one lunch) were offered at The Range, both of which were far below expectations. The menu, presentation, and service were on par with typical cafeteria fare. The Chinese restaurant offered tasty dishes, however service was inexplicably slow, and the food chilled quickly after it was served. Third, the common areas of Harrah's were less than accommodating. There was no place to sit unless one was gambling, eating or drinking. There was no complementary coffee or paper, even at the front desk. Most disappointing was the lack of pool/spa facilities. I was shocked that a resort with the renown of Harrah's didn't have a year around pool. The only positive comment I have for Harrah's is its central location on the strip.

For an overall rating, I give the property an 'adequate' rating.....nothing horrible, but nothing outstanding either. Cons: 1. This Harrah's is one of the older strip hotels, and it has that appearance in the casino/lobby/etc. 2. As mentioned in many reviews, here and elsewhere....the rooms tend to be somewhat noisy. My room was in the Carnival Towers, and I was originally assigned a room on the 10th floor, facing the pool/bar area (but well above it). The music from the bar was enough of a nusiance that I requested to be moved the next day (and was) I then went to the 28th floor, oppisite wing, facing the airport side. This room was much quieter for the most part. However, as the crowd increased towards the weekend.....it got worse. If there is ANY noise in the halls, it goes directly into the rooms. Even casual conversation is heard loud and clear in the rooms. In my case, there was a 'party' taking place in the hall which obviously was unbearable. After calling the front desk, 'security' came after about 20 mins and quieted things down. However, you could still 'hear' when other guests return to their rooms, turn on the TV's, etc. I guess this is a result of the age of property, but the lack of soundproofing is definitely an issue if you're a light sleeper, as I am. I would return for a mid-week stay, but the 'noise factor' would deter me from staying at Harrah's for a weekend. 3. Slots seemed to be 'tight' and there was a obvious lack of many of the newer games. Table games were always available, but limits go up at night of course. 4. The matteress in the first room was awful....the springs felt like they were going to come through the padding at any time. However, in the second room, the bed was quite comfortable. Pros: 1. Location. Obviously convenient to many of the other strip attractions. Walking distance to Venetian, Wynn, Ceasars, etc....even in 110 degree heat. The monorail station is right at the back of the hotel....an easy walk from the rooms. 2. Rooms were clean, and requests for extra towels/pillows were filled promptly. Housekeeping was always available, but not a 'nusiance'. 3. I ate at the 'Cafe' and the buffets. Both were good. 4. Rooms are convenient to the casino/rest......even if you're at the end of the hall, it's only a couple of minutes from the room to the casino. Not the case in some Vegas locations Bottom Line: If you know what to 'expect', Harrah's can be a 'good deal'. It is what it is, and if you can overlook the few 'bumps' and can tolerate a bit of noise, it's not a bad place to stay.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time at Harrah's\u201d", "Author": "southlvr", "ReviewID": "UR3654893", "Content": "Just got back from a four day stay at Harrah's Las Vegas 7-4- thru 7-8 .

The property is in need of an update to compete with the other strip hotels. It has the feel of a downtown Vegas hotel rather than the mega resorts now dominating the strip. The casino was very claustrophobic. A lot of machines and tables crammed into a small space. The walkways were confusing, some seemed to lead to nowhere. The ceiling throughout much of the casino seems very low. It is pretty dark in many areas. I was not comfortable there. The gambling was also horrible for me... The room I was in--in the older tower was okay. It was small but clean and pretty well appointed. I don't like shower curtains but other than that the bathroom was fine. The hotel staff was polite, efficient and helpful for the most part and the hotel's location is good. If you must stay on the strip, but you refuse to pay megaresort prices, this is an okay choice.

We arrived at the airport and our friends had arranged several days before for a limo to pick us up, but none ever showed. Check in was slow (and this was at the Diamond counter) and we got a really irritating lady with a high voice who needed some Prozac badly. The $20 trick got us nowhere and so we went to our room. Basic as basic can get. Clean and a nice size bathroom, with a view of the parking garage down below. No safe. We called to see if we could get a room with a safe but all of them were booked. Our friends had a junior suite, which they said was nothing impressive, and no safe in there either. No coffee maker. Which really ticked me off because every morning I swear they pumped coffee smell down the hallway, there was a Starbucks on the first floor and it must have come up with the elevators. The casino itself is fine, compared to some others we saw at the north end of the strip, and even next store to us. BUT, you go across the street to the Mirage, or to some of the other hotels like the Ventian, Mandalay Bay, or even Treasure Island, and you feel like you are checking into Motel 6 back at Harrah's. We gambled what I thought was a fair amount, $2500, almost exclusively in Harrah's, and got comped $82 off our final bill when we checked out. I was a bit disappointed with that. That covered our breakfast and lunch buffets and that's about it. If you like to play slots, the best times I found were before 11 a.m., I won a few hundred here and there, always in the morning. Then would pump it back into the slots and lose it later in the evening. The buffets were fine, I had read some bad reviews on them but did not have any problems, we ate at the dinner buffet one night and I thought it was very good. Did not go to any other buffets though so have nothing to compare to. The breakfast buffet Sunday morning seemed a little stale, but that was the second time we had eaten there. All in all I will not stay at Harrah's again unless the rooms are free. We may try the Rio. I really like the Mirage, and Treasure Island was very similar, will look into room rates there the next time we plan a trip.", "Date": "February 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cIt's Okay...\u201d", "Author": "caligoodgirl2000", "ReviewID": "UR3179946", "Content": "I stayed at Harrah's Jan 23.

We had two rooms in the Mardi Gras tower, one smoking on the 11th floor for the parents, and the 10th floor room 1048 (end unit) nonsmoking room for my fiance and I. From our room we could barely see over the Casino Royale facade for a view of Mirage's volcano, but I wasn't there to see volcanos, or for a wonderful stay in a room. For $35 a night on the strip, the hotel could not be beat. The beds aren't great, but they're not travelodge foam pads either. I personally didn't have a problem with them, and neither did my fiance who does extensive travel for work (usually staying at the Westin). The room reminded me of a trailer, the central air was loud when running and was activated by motion sensors that didn't sense anything when you were sleeping so I imagine it could get uncomfortable in the summer. We experienced a maid coming in on us in the morning, but that's what we get for not putting the privacy sign out. They did a good job, even folded the toilet paper into a triangle. The hotel had the Gilchrist Soames variety of toiletries with the godawful shampoo/conditioner combo goop, I recommend bringing your own travel variety. My hair was matted for five days. The shower curtain was another godawful component of the bathroom, there was so much???? caked on it that the curtain was stuck together at the bottom and would not allow for adequate protection around the tub. I could not bring myself to bend over to inspect or correct, I have poor eyes and enjoyed my ignorance. As for the common complaint of noise... This is my opinion, may not be a fair representation... We had an end unit (room number 1048 for your convenience) and was quiet, until Monday (20th). Then we had neighbors who liked to play Keno from their room on the TV. How did we know? Because we could hear them repeat the numbers on the TV and exclaim voluminous epithets to describe their losses. Again, for $35 a night, I could tolerate it and it reminded me that I wasn't here to sleep so I went down to play. My opinion is the larger hotels book every other room in a hallway to avoid this noise problem, there are tradeoffs though, it was a very short walk to anywhere within and out of the casino. I traveled with someone I met there to his room in the nearby Venetian and went through two separate elevators and wings to get to his room, in addition to two guards. It was a hike, and they pump some kind of funny smell in that place, my fiance liked it, I didn't care for it. I have stayed at the MGM and had a similar hike but no smell, still didn't care for it. Anyways, I was not intending to enjoy the room... While in Vegas I played craps at the Venetian, Casino Royale, Flamingo, and of course Harrah's. I found myself returning to Harrah's every time because of the people playing there and the quality service from the hotel staff. Drinks were fast (everywhere else was slow or fair), I drank Cointreau on the rocks so that they couldn't fool with it. After a couple of tips in Harrah's the drinks went from a shot of rocks and a dab of honey to a full glass of the good stuff. I was impressed. You can find $10 mins here from the hours of 10pm-2am, $5 and up otherwise. I played until 6am for three nights and managed to catch a cold in the process, so in those three nights I managed to get something like 477 credits for my play on mostly $5 min craps. 18+ hours of play for 477 credits, what did I do wrong? I think that could get me a breakfast comped. Some posts have complimented their comps but I can't agree. In addition, I think the points expire in 6 months so there isn't much use unless you are close to a Harrah's establishment. Someone else can confirm that. The food was fine, service within the restaurants was fine, nothing exceptional but these restaurants are designed to feed you and move you, I personally like the efficiency because there wasn't ever a wait (given 12/18-12/23). Time is money, no? We went to Cirque's \"Ka\" for $100 a head, it was good. I'm not a big fan of theatre altogether (we went to Chicago and saw Blue Man Group which was another godawful event) but I felt my money was well spent. They did a very good performance. My fiance is a Cirque fan and she said she loved it. It took 20 minutes for the valet to get our car at the MGM, another reason I would not return to the \"city\". The four of us decided to make one more night out of something so my dear mother, bless her heart, decided to go to a dinner theatre west of the 15 at a restaurant called the \"Egg and I\" for $50 a head. We thought that would include wine but we were mistaken to the tune of another $60. The food was prepared like one of those all inclusive resorts, you know what I mean, it was hard to swallow, and I had the cold then too. It was terrible, everything. I do not recommend it, especially for $260. For $35 a night this place can't be beat, I think when it reaches up into about the $80 mark I would begin to seriously consider weighing other choices. Big plusses for this place is the size (no hiking), the staff, the efficiency (no waiting anywhere from the elevators to the check in desk), and just plain fun. My fiance will not return because she does not gamble, so if fun=gambling, this is your place. I would go back. My budget for travel would scream at me for blowing $150+ a night when I could stay across the street for $35 and have a bigger bank roll for play. Casino Royale next door claims it gives you $50 in free slot play, I thought 'hey what the heck', it was $50 on a $1 slot machine sectioned off as 'promotional' and the only way to win was to hit jackpot. Time is money, I wasn't wasting my time... If you have read all of this thank you, and thank you all who have posted before, it was a major help in deciding where to visit in Vegas. If you have read this and you are the groom getting married in Vegas, make sure you get a limo, it is very tasteless for you to be dragging your wife across the street everywhere to get silly pictures of \"landmarks\" that will eventually implode in another decade or two.

We earned enough comps to dine at the Rio Buffet (the best in Vegas - we also ate at the Bellagio buffet) . Comps added up pretty fast. Rio & Harrahs are sister Casinos & Comps work both places. Free shuttle between Harrah's & Rio you can walk across the street to the Gold Coast & pick up a shuttle to Barbary Coast or Orleans so you can really get around easily without a car. Harrah's have already (June'04) comped us a room & dinner cruise out on lake Mead in August. We also got 3 nites comp room at Rio good for 1 year.

Ordered pizza from room service late one night, which was good and prompt. Ordered coffee and tea both mornings, a little pricey, was not too bad considering we could linger around getting ready for the day and it was worth it to have coffee and tea in the room. Room was very quiet, hardly ever saw anyone in the hallways, we were just a few rooms down from the elevators, which was nice. View was of rooftops but who cares, if we wanted to see the lights, we just went out to the street at night and looked at them. The only complaint I have is about the casino being so tight, although the last day there I did win some money at Harrahs which was nice. Pool area looked nice and had intentions of using it one day but there was just not enough time. Sat in lounge one evening and enjoyed the dualing piano show, this is twin girls playing songs and it was alot of fun, don't miss this one. Ate at buffet, pretty good, most of meal and room charges were comped. Harrahs has a great location. Also saw their headliner show which was great. Went to the afternoon comedy show which was just okay. I think next trip we will try the Flamingo which is just a few doors down, loved their casino and won some money there also. Was there at the start of Memorial Day weekend and the strip got really crowded on Thursday and Friday. Just one other thing, I can't believe some of the women who wear spike heals in Las Vegas, how can anyone walk any distance in them. Visited several other hotel/casinos on the strip.

I received an email back stating that they would be, but obviously I should have asked more detailed questions. The pool facilities were on the winter hours and closed at 5 PM. When I went to the pool area, to use the hot tub that area was blocked from hotel guests due to a private party that was going on.

We instead chose to go to the Improv and the show was excellent and we asked for the tickets to be comped and they were happy to do it. Checkout was very fast. We never ate at any of the restaurants in Harrah's so can't comment on that. The line at the Garden Buffet was very long most of the time. A good place to eat if you visit the Hard Rock is Mr. Lucky's. They have a Steak and Shrimp that is worth the $7.77 you pay for it. Another excellent place to eat is Bellasarios at Caesar's.
