It is located at the end of a narrow street with no chance to park but the apartment offers us its private place to prk our car. We have welcomed by the owners, very very friendly, and they have given information and help to visit rome. The apartment is new, clean and equipped with everything you need for a holiday. The owners are building a sun deck with a wooden floor and gazebos that will be ready by the end of April. I strongly suggest this place. I recommend this place for anyone who wants to go on vacation in Rome.

We were greeted by the lovely Katia, who gave us a warm welcome and gave us plenty of information about the area i.e restaurants, shops metro. We were 10 mins walk to the metro which was only 3 stops to Rome. Also there was a very good book on Rome in the bookcase which we all found very useful. Massimo was also very helpful in arranging check-in time and also he booked private car to take us to the Airport on our departure. We all enjoyed the jacuzzii!
