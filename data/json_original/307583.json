We didn't think the place would turn out to exceed our expectations. Located in a lush tropical hills of Ubud with rice terraces and a valley, combined with very friendly and helpful staff, our experience there was a great one. Since we arrived till we left, the staff had been very nice and the service was personal. We also got a complimentary traditional massage at the Spa.We stayed at a Garden Villa with an outdoor shower and stone stairs outside leading to our Bale Bengong where the day-bed was. Our view was not stunning because of all the roofs of other villas, but we got the valley breeze which was very soothing.The marble bath in the villa, though, is too small, an adult especially a male adult cannot get in it.The resort has a scheduled shuttle bus to central Ubud. But if you prefer renting a car of a motorbike, the staff can help you. There is also a spa with various treatments. The resort also has activities such as trekking, cycling, village visit, art sightseeing, Balinese dance lessons, cooking class, etc.", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR787173419", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "zags"}, {"Content": "Bliss Kamandalu is a peaceful resort set amongst the rice paddies outside Ubud. So quiet and heavenly sitting on our day bed looking out across the valley and admiring the sunset. At all times of the day there was virtual silence.On our arrival we were greeted with frangipani leis and a drink and were personally shown to our room. The staff were very friendly, helpful and attentive.The layout of the villas ensures they are private. Our special dinner beside the pool was memorable. Rose petals scattered on the ground and tea lights around our table. It made us feel like we were on our honeymoon even though we had our daughter with us. The pool area has lounges which sit in an area of shallow water, so when you are hot and not ready for a swim, you just dangle your legs over the side of your lounge to cool off.We loved our outdoor shower and the private courtyards and the four poster bed with mosquito net sides.

They gave us the newest villa 401. The villa is new and just in front of the club office. I think everything was great. The villa, the view, the private pool, and especially the food. The romantic dinner we had there was excellent. Everything so delicious. We order food from room service and also had dinner at the restaurant the next day.. All the food we ordered tasted great. The honeymoon cake is also fantastic; very chocolate rich :-) They set a romantic dinner in the garden and we had one waiter just for us. The surrounding, the setting everything is special. We will definetely come back there because so far the food is the best in Bali.

It's in a beautiful setting, with charming individual villas scattered around that are roomy, many with great views/private pools/sunbeds. The staff are gentle and sweet but not very sharp. It would be charming as a relaxing getaway hotel, but for a conference it was a nightmare. Forget about internet connections; there is only a very fickle wireless hotspot in the lobby.My main gripe is that it would have been a fantastic hotel once but it's really falling apart, especially the older rooms. A rumour was circulated during our conference that it'd been closed for 10 years and reopened just for our meeting. Probably not true, but from the condition of the rooms, it was nearly believable. Sockets falling out of walls, broken drawers, motheaten tapestry and creaky floors. Showers with no hot water and slippery moss-covered outdoor showers. You don't want to know about some of the muck that floated up from the poorly maintained private pools.... All in all I'm not very sure that it's worth the rack rate.", "Date": "Mar 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR690592778", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fishclic"}, {"Content": "Lovely Resort We were at Kamandalu Resort Ubud from 22Nov to 26Nov. We absolutely loved this property, it was one of the best resorts we even stayed at. Despite we only stayed in the lowest room catergory - Garden Pavilion, the room was so nice, relaxed and big, it has the balinese style high ceiling/roof top, marble floor, and a very cool outdoor shower. The villas was nicely designed with a small garden around the room, the bed was huge and very comfortable, overall the villa was very private  quite. There were also 2 day beds outside. The buffet breakfast was very good, however 2 of the nights we stayed, the resort had a lower occupancy so we had a la carte breakfast, but it was plentiful and delicious.The pool has a swim up bar which was really cool and the lobby was like a palace. There was nothing we disliked about this property and I would definately go back if I go to Ubud.The property has a shuttle to Ubud centre which takes about 10mins so we did not have problems getting around. Even if you need to get a taxi, it only costs about AUD4 to AUD5. There are many nice local shops and restuarants in Ubud centre, also there is a market and along Monkey Forest Rd there are many places where you can get very cheap massage, facial or hair cut - about AUD10 for 1 hour massage.Overall, Kamandalu is a very nice and stylish property in a great location with a stunning hillside view The villas provides privacy and relaxation and would be great for couples.", "Date": "Dec 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR142243262", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "yuyuho"}, {"Content": "Somewhat disappointing", "Date": "Sep 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR754034264", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Blankii"}, {"Content": "Amazing Place. Perfect Hospitality and tranquility and peace. We arrived in KAMANDALU Ubud- jetlagged from the UK and found it to be one of the most hospitable places that we have been. The staff are ALL absolutely wonderful, making you feel special and always smiling. They really make a nice place into an amazing place. We stayed in a jacuzzi villa which was very private and you really do feel close to nature with the frogs croaking outside in the evening and the early morning bird calls. The gardens are well tended and beautiful. The building and decor are not as slick and new as maybe some of the more polished new resorts, but this is more charming and close to the real Bali. The villas are made using natural materials thatch roofs and hardwood funishing with all mod cons and everything works well. Outdoor shower and jacuzzi are fab, but could do with an indoor one too for nighttime. The stone bathrooms and floors are excellent. The hotels in Bali are all down on occupancy at the moment, but this makes it all the more special as there are less people around and you have more privacy and easy use of facilities. The food in restaurant was lovely at all mealtimes. There is a taxi shuttle to Ubud town centre regularly and the spa treatments are very reasonably priced compared to perhaps more upmarket hotel chains. Whats nice is that Kamandalu is Indonesian through and through, its not a chain owned by a big corporate where the money leaves the country and its people. Stay here and you give something back to the people who make everything so special for you. Definately go to Bali, definately go to Kamandalu for peace, romance and culture.", "Date": "Jun 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR733241889", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Perfect tranquility..... I was lucky enough to stay at the Kamandalu last year for only a few nites, but I vow to go back some day. For those reviewers that thought the hotel was a little worn, perhaps then you should stick to destinations where climate ie. rain and humidity, will keep your resort looking shiny and new!!!!! This was the most beatiful villa resort!!!! It was unique and charming, and tranquil, romantic. The gardens were built into the side of a rice terrace, and once you got to the bottom there was a beautiful little pond that we could sit around.

(On a more positive note, some of the shops in this area are much cheaper than others in Ubud - and you may not have gone there unless you were staying at the hotel.) On first entering the hotel it looks like the lobby area was designed a couple of decades ago - however, all the staff give a warm welcome. The hotel is nice, but the decor is quite dated and showing signs of wear and tear. My first reaction to our room was 'Wow!, and the views form the rooms are lovely. But on closer inspection there were numerous fittings and elements of the room that needed updating. Also, our outdoor jacuzzi had cold water only, which made it almost impossible to use at the time of year we were there. Basically, it looks like it's time for a refurbishment. In other ways, the 'lived-in' look of the hotel has given it a patina of age and the gardens are quite lovely. And the staff and service were excellent. But I think for the price you are paying, there are better options in Ubud.
