{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good hotel - not close to Frankfurt though I had one night at the unfortunately named Bad Vilbel. I was there on business so it's location was good for me, but if you want to be close to frankfurt then this is not the hotel for you. Its about a \u9227?0 cab ride from the airport, and there isnt much of interest within walking distance. However the hotel itself is great, with big rooms, juliette balcony, large clean bathroom, wireless broadband @ \u9227? per hour (you pay T-Mobile for this, it doesnt go on your bill). It also has a wellness centre, with sauna, steam room and spa, which I used and it was very clean, although personally i prefer them a bit hotter. Front desk staff were very helpful with excellent english. Only negative was that there were trucks unloading early in the morning, so if you are a light sleeper, earplugs may be the go.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR766993605", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "bellmeister"}, {"Content": "Hotelmaschine   showReview(18392603, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR549659183", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "jubuha"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d228379-r8875663-City_Hotel_Frankfurt_Bad_Vilbel-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "228379", "Price": "$290"}}
