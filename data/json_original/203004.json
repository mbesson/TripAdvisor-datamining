Our room was immaculate and furnished with wonderful antiques. There is a nice patio with a fountain for personal picnics; there is a nicely appointed bar area. The staff will help you with access to the internet. Their breakfast is incredible ! Access to the bus is within easy walking distance.

The distance from the city centre was not too bad, i.e. about a 20-30 minute walk. However, there is very little within the immediate environs of the hotel - you have to walk for at least 10-15 minutes to come across any bars or restaurants. While we found this ok when the weather was good, on one day of our stay there was torrential rain and we (and all the other guests) were basically stuck in the 'hotel' for the evening, which was not pleasant.I say ' hotel' because Villa Carlotta should really be designated a BB - the star rating attached to it is misleading. We stayed here as part of a trip across Italy taking in a 3 star hotel in Venice, a 4 star in Verona, the Carlotta in Florence, and a 5 star in Rome: the Carlotta was by some distance the worst accommodation we stayed in. The picture of the front of the hotel was slightly misleading, as the outside terrace was never in use during our stay, even though it would have been pleasant to sit out.The rooms felt in need of refurbishment - the bathroom was tatty and dusty, and the wardrobe door in the bedroom did not shut - it sat permanently 2 inches ajar. More importantly, the curtains and shutters in the bedroom did not close - we had only a net curtain to keep out the lights from the street outside, so we didn't sleep well.There was no fire exit information in our room, and the internal fire doors in the hotel seemed to be permanently propped open (though to be fair, the 5 star we stayed at in Rome did the same thing).Our room was next to the 'office', i.e. the cupboard where all the cleaning materials were stored, and on more than one occasion we came out of our room and had to step over piles of dirty laundry from other rooms, which had been left all over the floor.The breakfast consisted of the cheapest, nastiest ingredients: cardboard-y croissants and bread, coffee that was undrinkable. Each time we asked for tea 'con latte' (with milk), it was brought without (again, this is fairly common in Italy, but at the other places we stayed, if we specifically requested milk, they did bring it).The TV channels were limited - we were looking forward to watching the Olympics during our travels, and every other hotel had Eurosport in English. The Villa Carlotta only had a German version available.Some of these complaints were really only minor irritations and could have been easily overcome by pleasant, friendly, welcoming staff. Unfortunately all of the staff we came across in our 3-day stay had very little to say to us beyond 'buon giorno' and 'buona sera'. Even when we came in after being caught in the torrential rain - literally soaked to the skin and dripping all over the carpet - the receptionist just smiled and said 'buona sera' and handed us our room key. The hotel didn't do room service but - as we were visibly soaked - I had been hoping they could send some hot tea up to our room. No. We had to get dried off, changed, and come down and get it from the bar.If the Carlotta had been a lot cheaper, it perhaps could have been good value, but for 130 euro a night it was a shameless rip-off. I would never stay here again and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. We couldn't wait to leave.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR594350689", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Belfast_traveller_8"}, {"Content": "Wonderful hotel in a converted villa       Santa Croce", "Date": "Mar 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR604632025", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "RomeTravelers"}, {"Content": "Quaint, older hotel in a quiet location.

Once I had seen the various reviews posted, I regretted my reservation. Yet, having prepaid my first night, I really had no good alternative but to check in. I visited the Hotel Villa Carlota during the period between Christmas 2006 and 1 January 2007 with my wife, soon to be 9-year-old daughter, and her little dog. We found it to be the kind of hotel that is most to our liking: not too large, service which is personal and personable but not intrusive, placed in, indeed part of an absolutely charming setting, in situ parking, a reasonably good dining room restaurant with fine Chianti Classico wines, and we were very happy with the arranged price. Our room was a good 20 square meters in size, comfortable, and reasonably furnished. The Breugel and Vincenzo on the wall were of the sort to really trouble Walter Benjamin, but even the David on display in the Piazza della Signora near the Uffizi is a copy. Florence itself is not far from becoming a kind of Disneyland of the Renaissance.The breakfast offered by the Villa Carlotta was quite fine and the breakfast area was pleasant. The famous annex seemed relatively unoccupied during our stay. The Ponte Vecchio is some 20 minutes away by foot, but it can be attained via a very pleasant walk through the Boboli Gardens. The Villa Carlotta is one of those nearly private European hotels where the murmur of various languages mixing over the aroma of good food reminds us of some of the best aspects of the past and encourages us to believe in a promising, prosperous, and peaceful European future.

We stayed 2 nights with our 5 month old daughter. The hotel provided a cot for her to sleep in. Further, they provided us with room service for dinner. The hotel restaurant is INCREDIBLE -- we would highly recommend eating there. There is also an internet access computer in the lobby for guest use as well as a bar which is always staffed for coffee or any other type of beverage. The room was clean with period pieces, although the bathroom was very small.
