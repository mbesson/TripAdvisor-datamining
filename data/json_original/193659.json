I checked at the Hotel Info booth a Heathrow and asked for a moderately priced hotel that was easy to get to and was located in an area that would allow some sightseeing. They made the reservations for this hotel. They knew it was my first time in London and I had not used the tube before. This hotel is two blocks from the Gloucester Station which meant that we would not need to change trains on the line from the airport. It took about 45 minutes to get there on the tube and that cost about $15 USD. We were told that a taxi ride there would have cost nearly $95 USD which sounded too steep for me. We had a map to the hotel from the station, but it still took us a bit to find the hotel as there is no sign out front and it is a block off the main roads. I had to ask for directions and I was literally in front of the hotel. It blends into the rowhouses and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize it is a hotel unless you look at the front door. This is an old hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c over a century old according to the framed newspaper story on the wall. The lobby is cramped and the carpet on the stairs is threadbare with some holes in it. There is a small bar and sitting area on the first floor, but I never saw more than 1-2 people in that lounge. Check in was efficient and the bellboys were friendly and attentive. We were given a room on the ground floor. The room was a bit larger than a standard room with large windows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c since we were on the ground floor, anyone walking on the sidewalk could look into our room so we needed to keep the curtains closed. You could hear conversations from people walking by. The bed was comfortable, the room had a CRT television, and Wi-fi was free and easily accessible. The bathroom was very cramped and the tub had areas where the lining was rubbed off. You had a large step into the tub for a shower which felt precarious when the floor was wet. Breakfast was included with our stay. They had a night restaurant attached to the lobby with hot and cold breakfast with attentive wait-staff and good, although basic, food. I liked the location of this hotel. It is in walking distance to the London Museum and other museums and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind walking a bit further, you can get to the shopping district. The tube stop is 3 blocks away and is surrounded by a grocery store and several fast food and sit down restaurants as well as a pharmacy. From the tube you can get pretty much everywhere, so I thought the location was great for my tours of Westminster Abby, the Tower of London, and Buckingham Palace. There is a Westin, a Holiday Inn, and several other chain hotels in the area and all of them look nicer that the Strathmore. However, they are quite a bit more expensive. I think the Strathmore was a good alternative for the budget minded traveler who is willing to bypass some of the luxury items and settle for an older but clean hotel.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, decent chain\u201d", "Author": "rigatone", "ReviewID": "UR124966994", "Content": "We used to live in London and know the city well.

It is in an excellent location for getting around London, close to the Gloucester Road tube \u00e2\u20ac\u201c District, Circle and Piccadilly Lines tube - yet in quiet enough an area to get some sleep. Being an old London terraced building it is very closed in, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d suffer a bit if you were claustrophobic - their website makes great use of wide angle lens shots - and has a lot of varying floor levels so if mobility is an issue take care. Rooms are nice enough, well equipped and clean, small and perhaps a bit dark but that down to age and design of the building, they are not the square box with corner bathrooms and all chrome, concealed lighting and fake wood of the Holiday Inn/ Hilton chains. Massive radiators - it was very cold weather when I stayed - my radiators were hidden behind thick curtains and blackout blinds so you have to do the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tuck behind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thing when you go to bed, if you want to wake up to a warm room. At least you could open the windows for some fresh air if you felt like it, again unlike many more modern hotels. Lovely relaxing bar area with sumptuous chairs and settees AND drink prices very reasonable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this in fact is probably the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best feature and a great place to end a busy day in London. Staff are excellent and could not try and do more for you. Only downside is their strange and annoying system at breakfast. I can see the reason for it as I am sure many London hotels get ripped off by guests booking room only and then slipping in for breakfast but you have to go through the third degree at your table - after being checked out at breakfast room reception - before they think about giving you anything. Well, that should be the system; I admit I did lose it slightly and asked that I at least got a coffee before the interrogation began. I got the coffee and they didn't seem to hold it against me - I know, never annoy people serving you food...... I was lucky enough to be able to get up and have breakfast late, I think that if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been on a more pressing business trip the system would have really annoyed me!

The building has maintained the style of an aristocratic mansion and, I understand, is a former residence of the Earl of Strathmore. It is filled with character, old world charm and caring, efficient, employees. As there is little staff turnover, I suspect due to superb management, guests are warmly welcomed and made feel at home. While some may consider rooms not too spacious, from my viewpoint, they are more than adequate, spotlessly clean, with cozy beds, the best of linen and tea/coffee facilities provided. High speed Internet is also available to guests, with complimentary newspapers on the doorstep at the crack of dawn each morning. Breakfast, served in the dining room, is excellent, with lots of choice on the menu and service par excellence. An added bonus is the location, close to all tourist attractions, smart shops, great restaurants, and only a short walk to Gloucester Road tube station. Airport shuttle bus service is easily arranged with the concierge.

We arrived by taxi, so no problem to find the place and we are reasonably familiar with London so recognised the general area. The hotel is in the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea so is very convenient for things like Harrods, Natural History Museum, Victoria, Chelsea Barracks and Sloane Square. The hotel is in an old building that has been refurbished, like a lot of hotels in central London so expect narrow corridors and creaky floorboards. The decor is Scottish in theme with plenty of tartan drapes and carpeting, which we appreciated being Scottish but you do get the sense of it being somewhat dated in appearance. The reception area is tiny but the staff were very helpful and checked us in very quickly. We were upgraded to a family room free of charge which sat on the corner and had one double bed and two single beds and a sitting area, so we really were spoiled. The bed was very comfortable, although it could be argued that this is due to an old and saggy mattress - for us it was perfect, but I could understand if others who prefer a firmer bed would struggle. The room was very warm so we opened the window wide to get some fresh air, but I didn't sleep very well partly because we were on the first floor and I was concerned about someone coming in through the window overnight. The shower and bathroom facilities were excellent and we had no problems checking out the next morning. We left our bags with the concierge for the day because we were going out and about in London before catching our flight and again this was no problem and free of charge. The breakfast was OK, but quite standard. A small continental selection of croissants and bread rolls, salami, cheddar, ham and processed cheese squares. It does what you need and there is also the cooked breakfast option which was spot on. Nothing fancy, it's not the best breakfast in the world, but it fills you up and the coffee was hot and strong, so we had no major problems. One thing to note is that the rooms do not have individual safes and you are told that there is a safety deposit box available at reception. We took our small 15\" Vaio laptop down to put in and it wouldn't fit in the box, also there are a very limited number of boxes so I'm not sure what you then do if there are none left. I don't think it would take too much investment to put safes in the rooms that would leave you with more peace of mind that your valuables were taken care of. The hotel is located about 4 minutes walk from Gloucester Road tube station that is on the Circle/District line and three stops from Victoria station. We ate and drank in the Strathmore Arms pub opposite the tube station and it was excellent, the best fish and chips we have had in a long time.

The streets have so much appeal that just walking there is a visit in itself (not to mention the second-hand clothes stores, because this is a very rich neighbourhood...). Chelsea is just below, on the way to the Thames, and worth a visit too; Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park just above. The location was ideal. The staff was very friendly.

It was an adequate hotel at most. My daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights. We were assigned a twin room as part of our group. It was undoubtedly the SMALLEST hotel room I have ever had. My room was part of what was originally a large bay window. Our window was one of the sides of the bay, so the back wall had a pretty serious angle to it.. (Our friends-a mother and son- had the other side of the bay...and yes there as a room in between ours. It had to have been a single.) We traveled in carry on bags. I don't know how you could get a regular sized suitcase in the room, let alone open it. There was a narrow \"hall\", with a small closet, inside which was a trouser press, and two small nightstands, which means you had to shimmy past them into the room. There was a VERY narrow path around the two small twin beds (pushed together, but sheeted separately), the path was almost unpassable at one point....barely calf width). Opposite the beds was a desk and an armoire (really in a room this small, are three nightstands and a desk really necessary?). Staying tidy in this room was crucial, if one thing was left laying out, it was unbearable. The room was so tiny the kettle, cups and coffee were in a tiny cabinet mounted above the desk. There was a decent tv on the desk and a fan. The fan was NOT optional. This hotel does not have air conditioning and even with the window open it was stifling. The fan worked reasonably well, but it took up the whole desk (minus the tv) and blew everything about. The rooms furnishings were fine, mid grade quality. The bedding was decent and attractive...though again in a room this small 3 decorative pillows per bed is excessive...where in the heck do you store them? The bath had maybe 2 1/2 feet square of floor space, which included the toilet. The shower was very small (you know the kind....soap the walls, spin and rinse), but the water pressure was good. The bath was clean and the amenities were well stocked and the towels were decent. The staff was friendly enough but varied between incompetent and indifferent. The concierge was NEVER at the desk. In the middle of my stay I received a bill under my door. I called down to the front desk to ask why? The gentleman who answered said he would find out and call me back. Well 30 minutes later, there is a knock on my door. It is 8:30pm. After a long day of touring I was in my jammies and watching tv. I thought it was our friends from down the hall so my daughter answers the door (oh yeah...no peephole). There stands the \"concierge\". I was informed that I had not left a credit card when I checked in. No one ever asked for one. My bill at this point was a whopping 8 pounds, but at 8pm I had to change into clothes and go downstairs and give them a credit card. First, why did the concierge come to my room instead of calling me back? It was kind of creepy....not friendly. Secondly, could it not wait until morning at breakfast...I was with a group, I was not running away. Every time we asked for information or directions they had NO IDEA and had to ask three or four people and THEN it would still be wrong. I advised others in my group to skip the concierge step as it was useless. The breakfast staff was also hit or miss. There was one young lady with a \"trainee waitress\" badge on who was very sweet and helpful. The only other waitress in the room was brusque and not very friendly. When breakfast was ordered, they take your room number and then come back and tell you whether or not it is included in your rate. Every morning. Several in our group ordered full breakfasts only to be told 5 minutes later that it was not included in their meal. There HAS to be a better way to handle this procedure...maybe vouchers? The breakfast was very expensive if not included. We had the continental breakfast included. It cost 6 pounds extra for the full breakfast. On their own the continental breakfast was 18 pounds and the full breakfast (which includes the continental) was 24 pounds. Seriously? The continental included two or three pastry choices, toast, tea or coffee, cheeses, sliced meats, cereal and juice. That is it. 18 pounds. They cannot be serious. The elevator is very small and slow. Luckily we were on the second floor so we were able to walk up and down the steps (though after a long day it was a long way up). Those on higher floors would be annoyed for sure. All in all, I cannot recommend this hotel. It is too expensive and does not live up to its rating.

Though some booking sites indicated we wouldn't get a breakfast as part of our fee, which was a special rate of \u00c2\u00a369 (far better than most other prices we were being quoted for a twin room at less than a week's notice), it turned out upon checking in that we would, and the continental breakfast was about as good as I've seen, with a selection of pastries, cereals, yoghurts, fruit salads and fruit juices, plus tea, coffee and toast as requested. That was one of the plus points of check in - a slight downside was that it took a little longer than expected to deal with the two groups in front of us (one of which was being told their room wasn't ready despite this being a good 30 minutes after advised check in time) and then when we came to be served, our receptionist walked off without warning and didn't come back for three or four minutes, but he was pleasant enough and we were in no rush so we didn't particularly mind. I think he was a bit rushed as he also forget to hand back my credit card, but luckily his colleague helped him out by returning it to me! As others have indicated, this probably isn't a hotel of 4* standard, but it certainly is no worse than 3*, as though the decor is starting to show signs of age (particularly the carpets), it has evidently been thoughtfully decorated to start with, and most of all, the hotel is very clean. The rooms (including en suite bathrooms which are purely a sink, toilet and shower) are all well kept and very clean, and we were pleased to find a Corby Trouser Press in the room as we needed to utilise this prior to our event the following day. The well sized TV provides all three Sky Sports channels, which is a bonus for people who want to catch any live games during their stay, and the lobby bar (which we didn't use) appeared to be showing sport for much of the time as we were passing. Some reviews have complained about the concierge regularly being away from his post, which amused us somewhat as we never normally need to make use of such a service while we're away, but the two men we saw manning the post seemed perennially busy, so it's probably unfair of other reviewers to have criticised them for being constantly on the go. The hotel is located in a lively area of Kensington - about three minutes away on foot from the nearest tube station (Gloucester Road) and its surrounds, which include a Tesco Express, several bars, and numerous takeaways/cafes. In spite of (or in addition to) this, the hotel itself sits on a quiet side street to keep noise levels to a minimum, and our room happened to overlook a typical inner London park, fenced in with trees and sitting areas, which made for a pleasant backdrop. The only noise during the night came from the fact that there was a little bit of a gap under our door and the fact that we were close to the lift. I'm sure this could be rectified by placing your baggage by the door - possibly a sensible move given that there isn't a great deal of room to place the bags anywhere else (based on the third floor twin room we occupied). The night we stayed, in late March, wasn't a particularly warm night, but the hotel itself was very warm. This was tempered by opening our bedroom window, and as we overlooked a quiet area, we didn't notice any undue noise from outside. This may, of course, be different if your room is on the front of the hotel.

The first impression of the hotel, walking in through the hallway down a long narrow corridor to the reception desk was - well is was Scottish.... tartan absolutely everywhere. The check-in was very friendly, if a little bit confused. They confused the names and genders of our party so that the men became Mrs and the women became Mr - it caused much hilarity during the check out process the next day. The rooms are truly tiny. You have to climb over the bed to get to the window, and there's barely room to open the shower door without falling into the toilet. But it was only a place to put our heads for the night, and for the price, it was adequate. It came as a shock when there was no hot water for the shower, but the hotel were quick to get this fixed. The bar had a nice buzz to it, with many of the hotel guests choosing to finish off their evening in there. The service was possibly the slowest bar service of all time - apparantly a shift change meant that we had to wait over an hour for a drink - although were weren't altogether sure why... and we weren't in any hurry. While it is probably the most calamatous hotel stay I've had in London, there was humour in the place as well as enough tartan to make me feel as if I was in the clutch of my forefathers, and for the rock bottom price we paid, at least the place was immensely friendly, clean, quiet and well located.

The breakfast was poor - very few choices, and the room, while very elegant, had dirty tables and most weren't even laid out with cutlery. All in all: good location, but the whole hotel is rather tatty.

The location was excellent, the staff were all pleasant ...and the beds were clean and comfortable. BUT....the room was tiny and to get to the other side of the room I had to crawl over the beds...fortunately we only had small bags with us....I do not know how any couple could have stored two suitcases in our room...it even puzzles me how you could get them into the room! Our television did not receive channels 3 and 4...they tried to fix it but no joy. The room decor was tired and in bad need of redecorating. The breakfast ...ours was continental...was uninspiring..the fruit salad was weird .. a peculiar taste. It took the staff for ever to offer tea or coffee...they seemed to do a lot of walking about but achieved nothing.

It was located off a very busy thoroughfare but the actually street was fairly quiet. Very close to markets, eateries and the tube station plus a stop for the Big Bus Tour Company. The room was small by (american) standards but nicely appointed (tea and coffee in the room) with a lovely bathroom (both cleaned and tidied daily). The decor was traditional and in spots a little worn but this just added to its charm. Breakfast was either traditional english or continental . We had the continental buffet daily and there was ample selection and the fruits and breads were refilled often. The wait staff was very nice and efficient. Concierge service was great and the staff was very helpful in obtaining us cars or cabs for early morning travel. We had never stayed in a 4* hotel before and were so pleased.

When we showed up around 8pm on the day of our arrival-we were surprised to find out that ORbitz's travel agent had switched us to another hotel completely. Without notifying me first! The sent the hotel a fax the day of our arrival negating to notify me at all. It would have been fine had it been a comparable switch but, the new hotel was quite a difference and no one pick up the cost of the transfer and additional cost to Heathrow in the morning since there was no handicap Tube station for my traveling companion. It was a terrible surprise considering I had a confirmation from Orbitz! No where on Orbitz's website do the state that they can switch you to another hotel! the Hotel staff was little to no help. I would have never foudn out I had a room at another hotel unless I pushed to speak to the Manager. Which by the way, There was no Manager on site at all in the evening!
