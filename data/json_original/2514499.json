Its a small hotel and the staff were friendly and helpful but there were a few negatives, the bathroom was so small we could hardly close the door when we were in as we couldnt squeeze past the sink!! The room was cold, the only source of heat was a small electric heater that they had left in the room for us, our bed was against a window and this probably didnt help! The breakfast was continental, which was grand for us to start the day, the staff leave a tray with cornflakes and a croissant outside your door in the morning.

My girlfriend and I showed up to the reception area and a young man, who could not have been older than 22, checked us in. Upon signing for the room I saw that he had placed us on the first floor at which time I asked if he could put us somewhere else. I have this thing about being on the first floor, I am always afraid that we are going to be right near the elevator, or that people coming in late at night are going to pound on our door, or wake us up from being too loud. The young man gave us a room on the fourth floor of a building down the block from the main entrance. It was nice, bathroom seemed pretty modern. There is no place to hang a towel in there, but there was plenty of closet space. There was no elevator in this other building so we had to haul about fifty pounds of luggage up four flights of stairs - no easy task. The young man told us about this before we accepted, but he also said it was a nicer room than the original one on the first floor he had selected for us. The room was made up nicely each day after we left, but what I can't stand was that the maid had turned off the air conditioner off each time after she entered. In a perfect world, housekeeping would leave it alone so that when we come back from a long afternoon of sweating in the streets, we could come back to our nice cool room and not have to wait the couple hours for it to become tolerable again. It must be a law of hotels to do this. They have a computer on the first floor which is free for guests to use. This came in very handy. Also, the concierge at the front, a pretty young lady, was very helpful with stores in the area that could help us, and where we could find things. You should know that this is a very ethnic area of London to reside in. Don't expect to see men in bowler hats and women with Union Jack flag earrings. Instead, expect burkas and full face coverings on women walking around. There is a strong Arabic population and the stores reflect that. None of them seem to serve alcohol. Walking along, you see a lot of juice bars and tea houses. There is one spot where you can get a beer late at night, it is an Austrian bar/restaurant on Bishop's Bridge Road called the Tiroler Hut. We went there after a waitress we met on the street gave us the lowdown on the area. She said to walk down the stairs, grab a beer and settle in for some fun. She was right. They serve good beers out of these huge Bavarian steins. They cost a pretty penny, about $26 U.S. for two. But the entertainment inside is the real gem. The Austrian owner has a karaoke bar complete with an electric keyboard. He sang \"My Way\" by Frank Sinatra in a thick Austrian accent and then he played a song on his saxophone. It was like a scene out of a David Lynch movie but I would not have traded it for the world. Only in Bayswater Baby!

We were so tired we said OK to this,until we got next door and saw the bedding! The pillows were all stained yellow with mould on them and the quilt which was sticking out the end of the cover was all disintegrating and mouldy looking. There was no tea,coffee milk etc at all and only a pershed old dishcloth on the sink. We went back and said we couldn't sleep in those beds. They relented and said we could have 1 night in the hotel and they would try somewhere else the next day. The hotel was better but still an old perished dishcloth on the sink the bathroom wasn't very clean. We were thankful though at this stage just for a bed. We were told we had to leave our luggage in the lobby the next morning and come back in the afternoon to see what they had found. Got back late in the afternoon to be told nothing else was available. It was either the flat next door or nothing. We said in desperation as long as they changed the bedding we would stay there. After all that we turned on the TV to find the only channels were arabic. Told reception, she didn't believe us until coming over and trying for herself. They did at least end up getting a technician in to install an aerial. I would say avoid this hotel at all costs.

After spending more than a month researching hotels relatively close to the City that were in our price range, we found that almost all of them looked extremely suspect. I got a tip for the Edward Lear and found that it was closed this summer for remodeling. However, Tripadvisor linked to the Hyde Park as a tip and it looked just right in the pictures. Booked it through Sun Travel and got rates that competed with almost all of the very poor quality lodgings. But, the price did not reflect the quality of the hotel at all. The remodeling they have done has updated it to a modern and clean look. Our room was a corner room which seems to have added a little bit of space. It featured all hardwood, or at least laminate, floors, a perfectly sized kitchenette, and a reasonable sized bathroom. The only real gripe I can offer would be the size of the shower though I think this is a standard in Europe. Being 6'1\" tall and weighing about 200lbs, I did find the shower to be a rather tight fit and the shower head was located right at about eye level. So, I was constantly ducking down to wash my hair, etc. The cleaning service was impressive, our bed was made and new towels were offered every afternoon. We had one mishap, upon arrival, where there was a questionable stain on the top bedspread and the desk clerk immediately came up and switched it for a new one. As far as location goes, I thought it was great. It's within a block and a half of the Bayswater station as well as Queens Way and Westborne Grove each of which offered a nice selection of restaurants. Speaking of which, there is a fantastic Greek restaurant a block in front of the steps to the hotel, a Sainsbury's within a block if you are interested in buying some snack foods to keep in the small refrigerator in the room, at least three different banks on Westborne and Queens Way, and a fantastic little bakery/coffee shop on the corner to your right when you come down the front steps of the hotel. Overall, the appearance of the hotel was very good, the room was clean and spacious enough for our 8 day stay, the staff was helpful and pleasant, and the location made it accessible to anything we wanted to do (via the underground) without wedging us right in the middle of the chaos that can be central London.

Breakfast consisted of 2 boxes of Special K (which we both dont like) two cold croissants, butter and jam, two cartons of orange juice and a 1 litre bottle of milk. Had we been told about breakfast coming to the room and being able to choose the cereal it might not have been so bad.

One of the rooms that we used which happened to be the room I stayed in was dirty, the floors had not been swept, the bathroom was filthy, sheets had stains on them and the towels had stains too. The showers ran hot water for 3 seconds then cold for 3 seconds. Not acceptable. But the most horrific thing we seen was that the small bin in the bathroom was full of dirty sanitary towels which was from previous guests who stayed in the room. Now at the time when we saw this we did not phone to complain about any of these things simply because of how rude and how un-managed the hotel was. However the Sunday morning broke it for us. We woke up at 10am ready to check out for 11am (which we had not been informed of this when arrived) and there was NO water in the hotel! We couldn't go to the toilet, have a shower brush our teeth. All the essential things you do when you are staying at a hotel! So we all phoned reception to complain and ask why this was the case to have such an abrupt lady shout at us down the phone saying it was the \"Thames valley water\" fault and there was nothing she could do. There was no update on the matter, we hung about in our rooms for over an hour and still no update. So we had to get ready, pack and head out of our rooms as it was past 11am. We went to the reception to speak to the lady who spoke to us regarding the matter and she was very aggressive, started shouting at my friend saying \"what do you want us to do! I cant do nothing!\" We could not get a word in, she told us that we would just have to deal with no water. I am sorry this is not acceptable. We asked for our Saturday Nights stay (1 night) to be refunded as we did not have the essentials and satisfactory of the hotel. She laughed and said \"oh I cant do that\" Now the argument was very heated, and she would not let us speak. We wanted to speak to a manager and was told it was a Sunday and there was no manager. Every hotel regardless of what day it is should have a manager, deputy manager, assistant manager anyone with responsibility to take charge. We refused to go unless we spoke to one. We waited 10 minutes and a man appeared who said he was the manager. Again the argument went round in circles and was very aggressive to us. He told us even though we paid them directly and not booking.com that they have to pay commission to booking.com. That is not our problem, as a hotel they have to deal with these sort of problems. Had this been the Hilton or the Ritz then there wouldn't have been a problem. His mannerism and ignorance was shocking.

One tip I would suggest is that if you don't want a trek every day to get to the tube,then maybe stay a bit closer to the action (which I know means more money,but may be worth it),but then you could always get a Taxi which are always available,they'll take you to Oxford Street for around \u00a310", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201camazing location, easy going staff and we had a lovely stay\u201d", "Author": "matawale", "ReviewID": "UR86739227", "Content": "small rooms, although my colleagues had bigger rooms but had everything i needed. very helpfull staff, simple and straight to the pont. this is a lovely little hottle where you don't expect much but you get enough. some beds hard, but i don't mind as i like had beds for my back.... see for yoursell, don't let anyone decide for you when you have the right to try", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gibraltar", "Title": "\u201cBetter off sleeping on the tube station\u201d", "Author": "assym", "ReviewID": "UR80323179", "Content": "I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

The Hyde Park makes Fawlty Towers look like a flawless five-star hotel. Late July I decided to spend 5 nights in London in August. It was difficult to find a hotel. Then The Hyde Park appeared to have vacancies. NOW I understand why........I sent them an e-mail about 9 days before I arrived, asking for a room on the top floor. When I arrived I was given a room in the basement; it was dark and cold and smelly and had only one tiny window. After one night I could move to a room on the first floor for the next 4 nights. It was very small. I kept knocking my elbows against everything! There was hardly room to put my suitcase down. The bed was very very hard. The maid forgot to give me clean towels, but had taken away the used ones...........In the room above me there were wooden floors and some very loud people. Apart from that there was a generator or something like that outside. And when someone somewhere in the hotel turned on the water tap, it sounded like a plane was taking off. So I was lucky to get some sleep between 2.30 and 6.30 a.m. I was exhausted! On the last day I had to leave for the airport quite early; reception forgot my wake-up call. Two positive points: one: the location of the hotel is great, not far from Queensway where there are two underground stations.

We booked single rooms and were expecting single beds but had doubles which was great. Bathroom wasn't huge but was big enough.

I thought the bed was ok, didn't find it hard or uncomfortable. Room and bathroom were both clean. And cleaned everyday. Sheets were only changed every 3 days unless you wanted them to be. Bayswater tube station is about 5 mins away and Queensway another 1/2 mins away from that. Which was handy for us when the Circle line was closed at the weekends. There is also a small Tesco right outside Bayswater tube station. Hotel is located in a quiet area but my room had a door into the next room. This was not good. The couple next door had a child which didn't bother me, but the next day they must have had an early flight cos at 5am they were up using the hairdryer. Not nice! My room was facing the back and there was a steal staircase outside which the staff used constantly in the mornings and were talking loudly to one another. This was from about 8am in the morning. So other than the noise the hotel was good. I didn't have breakfast so I can't comment on that. The staff that checked us in and out seemed nice enough. Didn't have any problems there either.

I thought I had someone in my room actually! And for sure the other person heard me breathing as well! - I got charged for breakfast (the room price included breakfast) but could not make use of it as they don't serve before 8:30 am. Too bad if you need to leave the hotel before that time. - Also unusual and maybe of interest if you travel with a few friends and colleagues: there is no breakfast room.
