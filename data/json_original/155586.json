The booking was made by a colleague who has all the right cards and memberships, which probably accounts for two things. One, an upgrade to a one bedroom suite, which, to be honest, was more than I needed, and two, a never-seen-before $48 daily food credit to consume at the hotel restaurant or room service. My oversized room was a bit dated, but nice and comfy - what you would expect from a decent 4 star property. There were no wireless internet connection or in-room safe though. As I got to know the hotel's food related services (did I mention the daily $48 food credit?), I found that while both room service and the restaurant were equally pricy, food delivered by room service was somehow better, as if they were coming from two different kitchens. I would say the restaurant is not more than average, however breakfast was quite good. Front desk was friendly and efficient, and by the way, those who aren't too obsessed with getting the room serviced daily can get an additional $5 credit for\u2026 yes, the restaurant.

Typically the Auto Show is at the Rogers Centre and the Convention Centre but I guess last year they condenced it all into the Convention Centre. The Convention Centre is still very close only about a 3-5 minute walk from the hotel. This is a perfect hotel if you are going to the Rogers Centre, Convention Centre, Air Canada Centre, or the CN Tower, all within walking distance. The hotel over all is very nice and clean. It exceeded my expectations as other reviewers had said it was outdated. The ONLY part I felt was a little outdated was the hallways to the rooms although the hotel has done a nice job with paint and window coverings to help make it look modern. Our room was on the 11th floor and although it was not a sutie it was probebley the biggest hotel room I have been in. The bathrooms are also very laege as well. It was very spacious and if you had a young child that needed a crib or you were bringing a crib there is a lot of room for that. We did use the pool and hot tub and both were very nice. There are change rooms there and towels are provided at the pool. The elevators are at one end of the halls so if you have mobility issues then do request a room closer to them. Parking is $20.00 for self parking and $30.00 for Valet, typical for parking in Toronto and it IS onsite underground in the Rogers Centre which was nice. The ONLY negative thing of the entire stay was that the Train Station is just down the street so VIA Rail Trains and GO Trains go by about every 5-10 minutes as there are a number of tracks right in front of the hotel. This did not bother us much but we were on the 11th floor and had thought that it must be much louder on the lower floors. When the trains did go by the noise would only last about 5-10 seconds. The sound did not keep us up at all at night. Just more of an FYI. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone and we would stay here again.

The location is very good as I knew my friend would want to see the CN Tower, and Rogers Centre. My main reasons for choosing this hotel are: 1) I got a pretty good rate. $139 on the internet for 2 double beds. 2) The hotel and Rogers Centre are located just off the Gardiner Expressway, so driving in is easy. No stop and go in busy downtown Toronto traffic should we have arrived at a bad time. 3) Parking would be easy, it's a stadium... 4) It's close to, as I mentioned the CN Tower and Rogers Centre, but also close to the restaurants on Front St and Union Station. It's a great 'jumping off' point. We arrived early afternoon on a friday, our room was ready, and the valet took our car. The whole operation was seamless and we were in our room within 30 minutes. We also arrived about an hour before the 3pm check-in time. We were given a 10th floor room with a city view. Upon inspection of the room it was easily determined that the room was not finished being made up. The shower curtain wasn't hung up, the towels weren't in place, the mirror was very spotty (like someone hadn't wiped it after spraying it with something, I'm not a picky guy). Also there was a big hair under the comforter, that was a little tough to ignore. One quick call to Front Desk informing them of the situation in which I nicely and with some humour explained my misgivings and what it is I would like to see happen (a new room on the same floor, if it could be accommodated), and I was back in the lobby exchanging room keys for a new room a few doors down and receiving apologies. The initial room was substandard, however the staff corrected the shortcoming quickly and did their best to respect my requests. I didn't think of the first room for the rest of our stay. I must give a thumbs-up to the beds and bedding. I have two small children and I suffer the sleep deprivation that goes along with it. The bed and bedding was fantastic, and the combination of bed, bedding, and a few extra hours of childless sleep worked wonders for me. We ordered up 6 beers (Stella Artois), come to a little under $50. Most people would complain but I've never been to a hotel that didn't charge like this for room service, particularly alcohol. I'm not saying it's good, I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying... Check out was easy, there were no errors on our bill, and the valet had our car brought around in under 5 minutes.

It also is only a 10 minute walk from Union station as well as the many bars and eateries in that vicinity. I would imagine this would be a great place to stay for sports events to for obvious reasons. It is also 5 minutes stroll to the CN tower.

It was our first time booking via hotwire, and took a gamble on the room, but because we so urgently needed to get out of Markham, we took what we could get. We received the room rate at 90$ (hotwire price) but ended up going a day early. The hotel booking agent gave us the CAA auto club rate (118$) and offered us an upgrade for our room. Which really meant little to us, we just asked that we have a king sized bed. When we arrived the room wasn't ready (I arrived for check in at noon, and the room was to be ready for 1pm), so I waited patiently in the nice comfortable lobby. One of the desk staff came over to me, brought me a coffee and some fruit from the restaurant and offered me a paper. Within 15 mins of that, they came to let me know that the room was still not ready, but that they had put a rush on it (still 30 mins before I was supposed to have checked in). They were clearly making an effort for me to get into my room. When I arrived in my room, we had been upgraded to a king sized suite, and the room was very clean and nice. They had moved us to a \"higher\" floor (8th) and we had a city view. The room was brand new, the bed was full of pillows (8 in total) and had a down duvet. A few moments later the front end staff called up to my room to make sure that it suited our needs. It did. She then let me know that we had a 58$ credit for room service or for the restaurant to use at our discretion. The stay was good. We had a great sleep, even though our room was above some train tracks, the room was quiet. The staff were all very nice and accommodating. Cleaning services were fantastic, our room was always clean - and I mean CLEAN - there was no dust or bits of anything left on the floor or on the tv consoles. The pool was nice, gym was excellent and the hot tub was a treat. The location is a bit of a walk, but in good weather, you have only 5-10 mins to get to Queen St. East and plenty of restaurants. We used our voucher for the breakfast buffet, which was very good. (Bacon, eggs, sausage, waffles, pancakes, omlette station, tons of fresh fruit and baking, cereal, bagels, fresh coffee and juices) and left the remainder as a hefty tip for our waiter who was very nice. I really enjoyed this hotel. We had ZERO issues and I'm a picky traveller. For the price I paid (50$ less than the hell hole we stayed at at the Holiday Inn), we'd def. stay there again.

Literally, I did not find one person who did not stop what they were doing try and make my stay more pleasant (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m NOT a bikini model). I didn't choose this hotel. I probably would have overlooked it doing my own research, since I always opt to be right smack in the middle of a funky and walkable neighborhood and I favor either a really modern or really \"authentic\" feel, but I liked this place. And not because it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs perfect. It isn't. Yes, the hallways are a bit odd and some rooms seemed quite far from the elevator at first. The heat did not work in the first room we were shown. It happens. But here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always happen: someone was at our room within 5 minutes investigating, and we were given a selection of rooms to choose from when the problem could not be immediately remedied. We ended up in room 403, a spacious bi-level room with a giant picture window. And when the Wi-Fi in the lounge was interrupted, someone was immediately on the phone with the engineer trying to get to the bottom of it. In the interim, I was directed to the Club Lounge and given another passcode. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the first time I received a handwritten \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd note for leaving a tip for housekeeping ($5). The Renaissance also turned out to be a nice walk (15-20 min.) from some amazing restaurants. Buca (Northern Italian) and Blowfish (PanAsian), both on King Street W. thoroughly pampered and delighted my taste buds. And R2 cafe on Queen Street W. is a great place to take a break from some fun shopping and enjoy a beautifully made cappuccino (they made perfect hearts out of steamed milk for Valentine's Day) and a pulled pork sandwich fit for a Foodie. The concierge also directed me to Kensington Market, which was a nice little bohemian oasis to visit for a couple of hours. The hotel is also right next to the CN Tower and attached to Rogers Stadium, which I imagine is quite fun during baseball season. A wall of windows in the restaurant/lounge look right into the stadium and there are about 70 rooms that offer similar views, allowing guests to watch games and events right from their rooms. However, if there are no events or events that don't permit viewing, make sure there are additional windows in those rooms before you stay in one. During my stay, part of the stadium was tarped off for a Harlem Globetrotter event, making the view from the lounge a bit dark. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check out the pool or the gym, but the restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s buffet breakfast was pretty good (a little pricey) as was the poutine (French fries, gravy, cheese curds).

For a 4 star hotel it really reminds me of a Howard Johnson, but a lot cleaner perhaps. We got the room through hotwire, which in our past experience when we picked a 4 star hotel, they land us a room at the Intercontinental. Instead this time, we got a room at the Renaissance that faces the stadium but there's no show going on. O well, tough luck, but still a pretty good buy perhaps. Throughout the afternoon and into the evening, you can hear noises going around in the stadium. The noise wasn't that bothersome - although you can hear it - and after leaving the hotel around 8:30 pm for dinner and coming back at 11 pm, the noise at the stadium is over. However, people walking around the hallways were horrendously insensitive to the guests who are resting! Every few hours we're awakened by groups talking in the hallway as they're walking towards their rooms, and then there's other guests opening their doors shouting and swearing at them to be quiet (I'd be irritated about the swearing if I have a child with me). There's a sign right at the elevator reminding people to be quiet but I guess not many people read that sign. The room is relatively spacious. There's a bathroom and bedroom section with it's own TV, and then you can go upstairs to the study/lounging section with another TV, which faces the stadium. It would be nice to have that room to watch a show/game. It's relatively clean, but you can see that it's dated as there's some wear and tear in the wallpaper, rusting around the mirror, as well as a tiny graffiti in the bathroom that the staff ignored. But for the price we paid for it, I guess I couldn't complain too much as we got it through hotwire so it's relatively inexpensive. They provide Aveda products as your shower products, so that was very very nice. There's also a Keurig at the \"bar\", which is kinda nice, but they gave you only 2 k cups....I've been in other hotels that provide you with a huge bunch of selection. It also would've been nice if they just gave us one small bottle of water that's complementary, which I think is pretty standard in other 4 star hotels, but no luck here.

I got the room as part of a special deal on Travelzoo for $99/night. I thought it would be perfect because it is adjacent to the Rogers Centre and we were in town to see the Disney on Ice show there. When I booked the room, the agent was very friendly but was only able to get me a King bed with a roll away cot for our child for an extra $20. When I got to the hotel, however, I asked if they had another room for the same price with two doubles and they were able to accommodate my request with no problems. I was glad they did not screw up on the bill and did not charge me the $20 for the cot which I no longer needed. Walking to that room was the longest walk I have ever taken from an elevator to a room ever. The room was wonderful, though. It was very spacious and the beds had tons of pillows. There was an LCD TV and a desk, as well as the usual night tables, dresser, and an extra comfy chair. What impressed me most, however, was the bathroom - among the nicest hotel bathrooms I've ever seen. It was huge and had both a separate shower stall and a bathtub, plus two sinks. Just amazing. The only downside was that the view from this room is horrible, it is just of a rooftop ledge and you can't see anything, except perhaps part of the base of the CN Tower. At least, however, there were no privacy concerns as nobody could see through our window. Even though the hotel is adjacent to the Rogers Centre, you still have to go outside to walk around it to the entrance gates. But it's still the closest hotel to the place in town. The self parking was an extra $20 which you pay at the exit. You park inside a designated area for hotel guests in an indoor parking garage which is attached to the hotel by an elevator. They give you instructions on how to get there when you check in. Like I said, you have to drive there but then once there you just go up the elevator which takes you right up to the lobby. Parking there is normally $25 so you save $5. They also have a valet parking option for $30. There is a Tim Hortons within a 10 minutes walk from the hotel and other restaurants everywhere as this is right in downtown Toronto. So you will not lack places to eat. We didn't go to the hotel restaurant as it was probably too expensive for our tastes. I found the service at the hotel friendly and professional, and was glad they got our bill exactly what I expected to pay for it despite the last minute change in rooms. For $99/night, it can't be beat. Even for a little more it is still a great location for visiting the Rogers Centre and CN Tower, and the room itself would have been quite perfect if it had a better view, but then again we weren't there for the view.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto Canada", "Title": "\u201cA gem in the downtown\u201d", "Author": "joshcna", "ReviewID": "UR122175206", "Content": "Very nice hotel - very large rooms (you could fit 2/3 of our 2nd story in the bedroom alone) - and huge bathrooms.

First and foremost, I was surprised at how dated the hotel was. The hotel was built in 1989, and while they claim to have performed a complete renovation in 2001, it is unapparent by the guest rooms. My room was on the ninth floor and had a decent view. The room was neither small nor large; what struck me, however, was how sparsely it was furnished and decorated. The walls were a bright yellowish color that, with the carpet, created a very \"old lady\" feel in the room. I mention this because one of the great things about Renaissance hotels is their contemporary, modern edge and this hotel was anything but. The rooms were drab and boring. The location was great, I suppose, if you are there for an event at the attached Rogers Centre Stadium. It is also a short distance from the CN Tower. I liked that there were convenience stores and restaurants all within walking distance. Unfortunately, the area in which the hotel is located lacks much character and shuts down at night, so if you want to go out drinking, etc., you will have to cab it to another part of town. My interaction with the staff was pretty minimal. The hotel does not offer turndown service (so I was surprised by the four-star rating so many websites have assigned this hotel). If you drive, plan to park valet, which is pricey but really your only option. Marriott needs to dramatically renovate this hotel or change its brand designation.

Not only did the whole floor smell like plastic burning, filled with a haze reminiscent of the smog outside, but the carpet was ripped up all along the hallway. And on top of it all, the humidity permeated from the outside into the rooms, And if decor matters to you, then expect an early 1990s bright pastel-coloured, Caribbean mosaic feel. I hope this motif changes with the renos. Luckily, the service was top-notch, as I will explain below. Aveda products in the bathroom. Process: After checking-in, parking the car, and getting the key to my room, I walked and walked into what seemed like the bowels of the hotel. It smelled bad, carpet was all torn, there was a haze...apocalyptic by the standards of a major hotel chain. My room was the furthest room possible from the elevator (and it surprised me as to how far that actually was...I walk a lot so have no problem with the exercise but this seemed really really far). After that walk, my key did not work. I tried every trick in the book, but to no avail. So I trudged back through the stinky, hot hallway and back down to reception. I explained my situation that the key did not work and the concierge acknowledged this error and gave me a new key. So I went through the motions again and this time, the key worked. But boy do I wished that it hadn't. It smelled so absolutely horrible, that I knew I couldn't sleep there. I went back down with my bags, and explained the situation to the concierge. I was prepared for the worst but what do you know, she upgraded me to the \"Club\" floor. That was really unexpected. At best, I thought I would get another room on one of the floors under renovations. But she apologized profusely for the inconvenience and the smells and such. We got upgraded to a fantastic room with a king-sized bed, awesome view, and best of all, it was clean and didn't stink. The floor itself was decent...nothing to write home about, but at least it had carpet and didn't stink. On our way out for supper, the same concierge came over and asked us if everything was okay, and if we had everything we needed. It actually seemed like she cared. AREA: Went out to a few clubs on the weekend and found it very safe to walk back from the Entertainment district. It's part of the Skydome/Rogers Centre and from the restaurant on the main level (and the foyer of each of the floors I'm guessing), you can actually see inside the venue. They were setting up from the U2 concert during my stay there - pretty impressive view. -took me 15 min to walk to Yonge and King. -took me 20 min to walk to Yonge and Dundas CONS -some rooms are located really far from the elevators -parking lot is a bit hard to navigate to if you're not familiar with the area (though access to the parking lot from the hotel is an elevator ride...but having to park your car there is a bit of a trek) -expensive parking (but on par with downtown Toronto I suppose) - a bit \"recessed\" from the downtown core (though only a short walk away) PROS -Great location, and I found it cheaper than other hotels (chain or boutique) right around or on King/Queen/Front Streets.

As a Marriott God Reward member, this is probably the worst Renaissance hotel I've stayed in during my years of traveling. It is not the \"Toronto\" Renaissance. It is the \"Rogers Arena\" Renaissance - and that changes everything. Like all Marriott Rewards profiles, ours lists our room preferences. This includes non-adjoining rooms. Receiving an adjoining room should have been our first solid sign that this was going to be a rough ride. Naturally, the Toronto Blue Jays had back-to-back games during our visit; therefore, the hotel was housing families with kids running up and down hallways, playing in elevators, or traipsing through the lobby soaking wet after a swim in the pool. Another core customer base were the loud drunks - both before and after the games. This included the folks on the other side of our room's adjoining door. This room was housing more than two drunk, loud adults and they in turn had the doors open for a floor party between a number of other rooms. The noise level was insane and it went on all night. We called the front desk and, after no response, headed down to the front desk. Ultimately, we had to move to another room. Take note of that again: WE had to move to another room - in the middle of the night. The restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter) that qualifies a hotel as \"full-service\" was closed for the entire time we were there. After a long day touring in the city, we decided to go to the health club facilities to swim in the pool. We arrived at pool level and were surprised that we could hear the stadium crowd from inside the health club. We were wrong - it was the cacophony being generated by the overflow crowd in the pool. The pool was overcrowded beyond belief. No adjectives can adequately describe the insane amount of people, the noise, and the complete pigsty the changing rooms were. The hot tub, which probably could seat four adults comfortably had eight people in it. That would be five people crammed on the underwater benches and three overweight adults squatting in the middle of it. Observing all of this from the top of the stairs descending into the pool area made me think of one thing: there was not enough chlorine in Ontario to control the germs in this overflowing petri-dish-of-a-pool. This hotel does not meet the quality, service and amenity levels that I have come to associate with a Renaissance. While my complaints are about other guests, I think it is the responsibility of the management to preserve the brand and provide guests with an experience equivalent to the cost. This hotel is a complete rip off. If for some reason you can't help but stay at this hotel, I have to draw your attention to the hallway wallpaper. I've never been moved to comment on wall coverings before, but this place deserves a mention. On the two floors we were housed on, the hall way wallpaper created an impression that the walls were made of cinder blocks. I don't think I've ever seen a more bizarre wall cover selection in all my travels. It gave the guestroom halls a look that was something of a cross between inner-city elementary school and county jail. Also note that the \"Harbor Front\" is wildly overrated. Travel guides universally recommend the area, but I don't see the appeal. The restaurants were lousy. The place was deserted and it seemed to be another city trying to bring life to the waterfront. Unless there is a concert scheduled or art show underway, it is dismal. I hope this helps.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cClean and friendly.\u201d", "Author": "armeegurl", "ReviewID": "UR117073154", "Content": "We stayed here for a race we were doing in Toronto.

The room was very clean and quiet and we heard no noise from the trains. I loved the bed, but my partner found it a little soft. It was one of those suites that you never wanted to leave. I thought the location was excellent for sports fans, but a little out of the way compared to other Marriott hotels in the area. Saying that, downtown Toronto is very walkable and safe.

When booking this hotel, I explained the situation of my husband's disability. He uses an electric scooter and we require wheelchair accessibility. The reservation lady assured us that there are highly valued accessible rooms and she indicated the hotel was very suitable. She proceeded to tell us about the beautiful pool area and wonderful W/C accessible rooms. Upon arrival, our room was NOT accessible at all. There was only 1 safety bar and there was a bathtub, which my husband is unable to use, as he needs a stand in shower with a seat. I explained this to the front desk and they were NOT accommodating at all. The hotel brags about a wonderful night sleep... The walls and doors are so paper thin you can hear EVERYTHING in the hallways. The first night we listened to a domestic dispute from 2 a.m. until 4:30 am. I called the front desk and the security guard came, knocking 4 times throughout 1 hour, telling the other guests to be quiet. Eventually they were removed from the hotel, but not until sleep was way past due. I heard EVERY detail about this fight, which was occurring in a room down the hall. The second night, we were awoken to the 2 am bar crowd, again making terrible noise throughout the halls. The third night, Justin Bieber's concert, again was sleepless. We spent $250/night for one of those nights! This hotel prides itself on being 4stars...I have had better night's sleep and service in many other budget hotels. We decided to check out the pool area, which the reservation lady had assured me was accessible for my husband. The access to this pool is a winding staircase, so my husband could not use it at all. I asked the front desk if there was an alternate route to the pool. She replied that there is a \"bat cave\" way there, but that she would not allow us to use it. We decided to try to get a W/C accessible taxi, as there was not much we could do at the hotel. We asked the concierge service for the contact information. She was quite rude, and then proceeded to give us 3 numbers to call...none of which worked for an accessible taxi and which I spent an hour trying to figure out who the correct person for me to talk to was. We travel frequently and I work in the travel industry. We are not picky and do not complain often. This was the worst stay, with the worst service, and the worst follow up care I have ever seen. I am still waiting for someone from the hotel to try to rectify this, as we are still completely dissatisfied. Three nights and $700 later... We feel we were totally lied to by the hotel, they did nothing to try to assist us in our stay.

I booked for $190 CAD per night, AAA rate that was supposed to include continental breakfast.

The hotel is 3 blocks off King Street with its restaurants, and not far at all from Chinatown. I had no quibble with the room for a business stay. Everything was clean, the bed was super comfy, and the room was very light & bright. I wouldn't pick this for a romantic getaway with the hubby though. The bathroom was large, lots of towels and supplies, and my room had no issues with mold or anything like previously mentioned. However, my colleague said his room did have mold issues on the ceiling and tiles. I guess its hit or miss. There were two big drawbacks to my room. First, no safe. That meant I had to carry my passport everywhere with me. Second, the train tracks. As soon as I saw them out my window I knew that would mean trouble and I was right. The trains mercifully come a lot less frequently overnight, but they do still pass by and in my room on floor 4 every time one passed the window-the bed-my teeth all rattled. They gear up again bright and early around 7AM. I had my white noise app on my iPhone but it didn't really help. Getting a room on a high floor might. I used the gym twice. It is TINY with old equipment, but the treadmill worked and that's all I cared about. I had the gym to myself, and peeked my head in the pool room. It was empty too, which was a shame because it looked nice to me. Room service was not overly expensive, no irritating fees, and arrived on time and hot. Service was friendly. The food quality was typical room service, except their signature apple pancakes were just terrific. If you are looking for a hotel with lots of amenities (pool, gym, onsite parking, restaurant, etc) and don't mind the train noise then the Renaissance would be an okay choice IF you come across a great deal.

It sounded like a convention on our floor. They were clearly having a party. I called the front desk and they said they would send security up, but never did.

I spent more than a few moments scratching my head wondering, \"Did they mean to go this route on purpose?\" My husband I spent the weekend here for our wedding anniversary. Having previously honeymooned in Toronto, we decided to roll the dice for a 4 star on Hotwire - Downtown West. For $73 per night, combined with our Marriott Rewards membership, we ended up on the Club Level floor in a decent but average room looking out over the city. If you are a light sleeper, take into account the train station runs directly next to this property. This hotel is a pain in the backside to find. Thank goodness for GPS. Parking is $30 valet or $20 self-park (a hike around the block and eventually under the hotel - we passed and went with valet). Check-in was uneventful and Lucy, one of the few staff that cracked a smile, eventually found us a room with a king bed. As a side note, this hotel is part of the Rogers Center - an indoor, retractable dome stadium for the Argonauts and Toronto Blue Jays. We were there the weekend the Argonauts had a 1pm game on Sunday. Didn't create a problem for us. The bed was nothing short of heaven. The amenities were Aveda. With a tip for housekeeping, they were generously supplied. There was a Keurig (k-cup) coffee maker and mini fridge. Everything was clean and new.... just strangely out of a 1970 decorating magazine featuring IKEA like products. Breakfast brunch is offered for $15pp until noon on Saturdays and Sundays. With an omelette station and plenty to choose from, we felt the price was appropriate. The evening meal was another story. Horribly over-priced and the food over-cooked. We dined in for convenience and should have opted for elsewhere. The service was hit or miss. No one seemed to care it was our anniversary until we settled up Sunday afternoon. I wasn't expecting a surprise party but a simple response to our reason for visiting being something other than a shrug would have been thoughtful. Our Saturday morning waitress was incredibly friendly and efficient. Saturday evening's waitress seemed irritated that we were there. Sunday morning we were back to a friendly but this time harried waitress. Our room attendant was great. The front desk ranged from quietly efficient to downright cold. Again, hit or miss. If given the opportunity to stay elsewhere downtown for the same price, we'd choose differently. Hotwire is a gamble and we knew that when we booked the room, so no complaints there. If you go, definitely sign up beforehand for Marriott's free rewards program. It gets you a boost to the Club Level, by far the nicest floor of the hotel It's hard to choose Yes or No for our recommendation. $73 for a 4 star downtown is a great price. $30 for valet parking is not. Free Wifi for Rewards members is a nice perk. $1.60+ for local calls is over the top. If you're on a budget and factor in the parking, as well as planning to eat elsewhere for dinner, it might be worth the downsides to stay.

The room was clean and comfortable.The location was great and close to many popular attractions. Parking was convenient and affordable. The food in the restaurant was mediocre, but honestly about what you expect from your average hotel restaurant. Unfortunately, the rooms are looking rather tired and definitely in need of an update. The window curtains were stained, as was the fabric on the office chair. The counters in the bathroom were chipped, with stained caulk around the sink as well as the tub. The floor tile was also stained. The walls are ridiculously thin, and we could hear absolutely everything said out in the hall. For a supposedly four star hotel, you just expect a little more. When we arrived our do not disturb sign was missing, as was our coffee maker. All of the accoutrements for the coffee were there, but the maker itself was gone. These are things that you expect the housekeeping service in a four star hotel to keep track of. Once we requested these items, the staff replaced the immediately. As many other reviewers have noted, there is no wifi available in the rooms. It is available free in the lobby and lounge, but how annoying. When traveling from the U.S., data roaming is expensive and forced us to sit in the lobby to use the 'net. It's 2010, and I just expect more from hotels these days. Security is also seriously lacking. Anyone off the street can stroll into the hotel and access the guest rooms. There are no security systems (such as key card in the elevator) to prevent this. We were rude awakened at 5 am by someone pounding on door asking us if we had called for a massage. When we reported this incident to the front desk in the morning, they informed us that the man had apparently been knocking on doors across the hotel until guests reported it and security kicked him out. They told my husband that they thought they stopped him at the 5th floor, and were surprised that he reached us on the 8th floor. They graciously offered us free breakfast which was kind and an example of their good customer service. We couldn't help but think however, that they really need a security update to the hotel. Another security issue we experienced involved housekeeping. We returned from a day out, stopping in only to change our clothes for a few minutes. We found a housekeeper cleaning our room. When we told her we just wanted to pop in for a few minutes, she opened the door for us and did not even check to see if we had room keys. We informed the front desk of this situation and they told us that housekeepers are trained to close the door and call the front desk to verify the guests name. This didn't happen in this situation, and it was disconcerting. Regardless of what may seem like a lot of negatives, it was a pleasant stay and I would still recommend this hotel to others.

There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much to write home about, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worse is the location is not ideal for sightseeing either. ROOMS: I was on the ninth floor with a view that overlooks the entertainment district. The TV in the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even a plasma/LCD, and the carpet was uneven with visible stains in several areas. On the other hand, the bathroom was spacious with Aveda products. SERVICE: The service was inconsistent. I had two front desk agents check me in. The first one didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t smile and then walked away mid process. Thankfully, a second agent resumed checking me in with a bit more hospitality. Later I returned to the front desk with a question, and Anna gave brilliant professional service. Thumbs up! AMENITIES: The pool was larger than expected but felt very institutional and in need of some comforting d\u00c3\u00a9cor in the room. The fitness center was bare bones, but apparently it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just temporary until the Rogers Center health club reopens. I was told guests can access that one in the future for free. There was comp WiFi in the lobby, which is always a perk. LOCATION: Great location if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to the Rogers Center, but otherwise its southwest downtown location is a bit isolated from most other touristy areas. The entertainment district is a stone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throw away though. CLEANLINESS: In addition to stains in the room carpet, there were other instances when cleanliness was not at four star standards. Old gum on the hallway floor, stains on the backs of lobby couches, dings and marks on the walls, spilled liquid spots in the elevator, and so on.

A comfortable king-sized bed was provided. A coffee machine is provided. The rooms are non-smoking.

I took the TTC from the Airport to the hotel when I arrived, but this is a long time-consuming ride, 1 bus, 2 subways and a 5-6 block walk from Union station. Going back to the hotel, I took a taxi (but keep in mind the inevitable traffic to the airport and count 60 - 90 minutes in travel). 2 An exercise centre is provided, but closed as of 6pm on Saturday and all day Sunday, so entirely useless for my needs. (Very contradictory for a \"sports\" themed hotel.) 3 Religious propaganda is in full place at this hotel, not only the typical hotel bible but also a mormon religious text is available for your reading pleasure! 4 Finally, Internet access is available (wireless or wired)... at a cost of $13 / day. I find this excessive and clearly priced above the cost of the providing service. At a hotel that does not charge for using the TV, hot water or electricity, I believe that $13 (plus tax) is a rip-off. Overall, I would recommend the hotel (with reservations), especially for someone who enjoys spectator sports.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cWhen Priceline Attacks!\u201d", "Author": "GroceryLawyer", "ReviewID": "UR46967855", "Content": "Full disclosure, I got a ridiculously good Priceline bid in ($61/night), so I'm really not complaining. But beware, as Priceline says this is a 4-star hotel - there's just no way that it is. While I'm sure I wasn't going to be given the Rain Man Suite based upon my Priceline bid, would it have been asking too much to get a room that didn't have its (dated) wallpaper falling off or one that had all the trash picked up from the floor before we got there? Decor for the hotel is super old and in need of updating. Also, if you get an outside room, be aware the train runs right next to it. To be fair, the windows were pretty sound proof, so it just sounded like a dog growling when the train when by. The soundproofing between the hallways and the room, however, is a different story - you hear every yahoo coming back at 2:00 am and later. Romance factor is a zero. Location is just ok - right accross from CN Tower, which is good if you're going to the CN Tower, but a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station (Union) where you can reach more of the action (Toronto has a lot of great things to do, and the subway is a nice way to get to them).

Unfortunately there weren't any stadium view rooms available. On our return to the hotel a few days later we were given another room on the eighth but it was very poorly laid out and way smaller than the first. It wasn't good for us at all, but we got moved after discovering that one section of the carpeting on the floor was soaking wet - a leak from the pipes in the washrrom I suspect! The room on the 3rd floor that we got moved to was adequate, and probably a little above average with respect to room size, but certainly not as well laid out as our first room. Overall, the hotel was good, and the service was great, but parts of the hotel was looking a little worn. Maybe some minor renos might help some areas of the decor! Parking: $20 per day is a pretty good rate, and I would advise against valet parking. The entrance to the underground parking is a few minutes drive away, but the parking is directly underneath the hotel so it is an easy jaunt to the elevators and into the hotel. Room Service: Very slow and extremely salty for our tastes. Priced about average for room service. Restaurant: The weekend buffet was quite good and not priced too high.

(We had just checked out of the Residence Inn and were concerned that if we checked back in again, the 2nd stay wouldn't be counted for purposes of Marriott's promotion.) Initially, we were unimpressed. We arrived about 3:30 and the woman at the front desk told us no rooms were available yet. She did say she'd put a rush on the request to have a room cleaned and indicated we could wait in the lobby, where we could tell that at least one other couple was waiting. We waited for about 30 minutes and then I checked again with the same employee. Nothing. I asked if she could come over (i.e. walk about 20 feet) and let us know when the room was ready. She said no because the only way she'd know the room was ready was by checking the computer, so we'd just have to keep coming back and asking her. (Obviously, she could have initiated the query herself and then come and told us, but she couldn't be bothered.) About 15 minutes later, my husband went and asked the other front desk employee (Ryan), who checked and said that the room wasn't ready yet but took the initiative to give us a coupon for two free drinks and an appetizer at the restaurant. A few minutes later, he jogged over to the restaurant (so, clearly, front desk employees aren't glued to the floor) with the keys and said he'd checked and the room was now ready, and yes, we could still use the coupon. He was all smiles and initiative, in marked contrast to his colleague. We went up to the room, but were disappointed to discover that it (1037) ran along behind the elevator bank, with the bed up against the wall where the elevators run. I'm not too picky about my room, but one thing I hate is being near the elevator. So we called the desk and reached the not-very-helpful woman I'd first dealt with. When I asked if another room was available, she said no but that we certainly could come back downstairs, wait again and see if something else opened up. Her choice of words was perfectly polite and professional but her tone of voice clearly conveyed the impression that she thought we were demaning too much and that she'd rather do something other than help us. Back downstairs, we made a beeline for Ryan, who queried the system and told us that a few rooms had opened up in the meantime. He then recommended a room that he characterized as \"one of his favourites\", explaining that although it was on the other side of the other elevators, the layout was such that the bed was far from the elevator and that the room had other nice features. We checked it out and he was right. It might have been just a sales pitch, but he delivered it with such sincerity and demonstrated so clearly throughout the rest of our visit that he wanted to go the extra mile to make our stay pleasant that he completely changed our initial, less than favourable impression of the hotel. The new room, 1135, was a little noisy (due more to the trains outside), but we found it was large and comfortable. At $120 per night (with a good, free breakfast included because I have gold status), the hotel was a relatively good deal. On balance though, I much prefer the Marriott Eaton Centre (for its central location and room quality) and the Residence Inn (because of the apartment-style accommodation). The Renaissance Skydome may be a good choice for sightseeing when the weather is ok, but if it's freezing cold, snowy, rainy or boiling hot, it's not as conveniently located as either the other downtown Marriotts (M Eaton Centre, M on Bloor, Courtyard on Yonge or Residence Inn), which are all closer to the subway system. The Marriott Eaton Centre and Residence Inn are better situated if you have business in the financial district, and the Marriott Eaton Centre and Marriott on Bloor are the best choices if you want to shop.

This hotel is located inside Rogers Centre, home of major league baseball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Toronto Blue Jays, adjacent to the Metro Toronto Convention Centre and the CN Tower, and close to the waterfront. Our 7th floor room was spacious, clean, well appointed, and very comfortable. It had two double beds and a separate sitting area. It faced out the front of the hotel, where we could observe people coming and going for the baseball game. Some rooms face into the ball field. Parking was under the stadium in a special hotel zone which had direct elevator access to the hotel. The food in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Arriba restaurant was outstanding. We (family of four with kids 9 and 11) ate lunch there and we all loved the food. I had the Arriba club, which came with a very well done salad. You can eat more cheaply nearby, but in my opinion, the food was fairly priced given Arriba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent food quality. My son and I went to the baseball game the night we were there and stopped back at the Arriba after the game for wings and a drink (I had the mango margarita). Again, both the food and the drink were excellent. The restaurant overlooks the ball field so we could observe the post game cleanup and the closing of the stadium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retractable roof (fascinating to watch). My wife and daughter went to a show nearby and had room service for dinner, which they were also very happy with. We booked the AAA/CAA rate which came with a restaurant credit and represented good value in our opinion. This is a very fine hotel which deserves its four star rating, but it suffers from one area of neglect. The swimming pool area had dirty floors and needed tile grout repairs/cleaning. The pool area also had much visible rust on stairs, pipes, and light switch covers. There was a greenish staining on the wall going up the stairs (algae?). Pool areas are naturally humid, but this one left the windows dripping with humidity and large sheets of paint and/or plaster hung from ceiling beams. They need to add some humidity control. Finally, the pool water was cloudy and uncomfortable on the eyes, probably indicating unbalanced pool water (high pH). When I asked the staff at the nearby fitness centre how to start the whirlpool, they simply replied that the fitness staff had nothing to do with the pool (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153not my department\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attitude).

I was given the choice of the Renaissance or the Royal York. I have stayed at the Royal York in the past (rooms can be small) so I thought I would give this hotel a try. Big mistake! First of all, the 4-star rating is indefensible. I have stayed at many other 4-star hotels in Toronto (Royal York, King Edward, Sutton Place, Intercontinental, Westin, Sheraton), and the Renaissance is just not up to those standards. The lobby and room decor is \"1990's Carnival Cruise Ship,\" and the furnishings are starting to look rough around the edges. The quality of the business facilities, fitness facilities and restaurant/lounge are also not up to 4-star standards. I had the misfortune to be staying at the Renaissance during a \"Monster Moto-Cross\" event at the Rogers Centre. This meant that the hotel was packed with people attending that event (think Cletus and Brandine from \"The Simpsons\"), whose main goal was to drink as much alchohol and make as much noise as possible. Since I didn't pack my trucker hat or Wrangler jeans, I avoided the lobby bar and restaurant and ordered room service. The meal was actually quite good (green salad, shrimp pasta, wine) and not unreasonably priced. Delivery was prompt and courteous. My plans of getting an early night's sleep after dinner, however, were thwarted by the incessant drunken carousing of the Moto-Cross people, who apparently were too cheap to go out after the event ended and instead spent the night (and I mean from 10:30PM to 5:30AM) roaming the halls, going back and forth from room to room, drinking in the hallways, slamming doors and behaving like teenagers on spring break. I called the front desk to report the problem, but nothing was really done about it. Also, I had asked for and was given a room on a high floor facing the city instead of the playing field (thinking it would be quieter). This proved to be a mistake, as the noise from passing trains below was surprisingly loud. Bring earplugs! This is one of the strangest hotels I've ever stayed in. It doesn't really have anything going for it unless you are attending an event at the Rogers Centre and want to be as close as possible to the action. If you are thinking of staying here I strongly suggest you first research what events are scheduled at the Rogers Centre during your stay, for that will likely determine the make-up of the clientele.

We came into the city on the Airport Bus and were dropped off at the base of quite a large flight of stairs leading up to the CN Tower, the Rogers Centre (aka Skydome) and the hotel. It's a bit of a haul with luggage from the stop to the hotel entrance. However we could see why the hotel would be convenient for anyone wanting to attend the baseball since it is attached to the stadium! Large reception area with efficient staff who allocated our room quickly. Unfortunately they did not give much information about the hotel itself and we were consequently unaware of the pool on the premises despite staying for two days (we were distracted by the city attractions!). Our room, unlike many of the photos posted on the TA website, did not overlook the stadium interior. Instead we were at the front of the building looking on to the railway lines leading to Union Station! Fortunately because of Thanksgiving, traffic on the rails was limited and we didn't have trouble with the noise of trains rolling past at night. The room was a reasonable size, well furnished and decorated. The bathroom was larger than many similar standard hotels. Bed was comfortable and there was an easy chair for relaxing after a day walking around the city. Room was very comfortable overall. The dining area where we had breakfast had windows overlooking the inside of the stadium however when we were there the arena was in darkness which was a pity. On one occasion we did see the arena lit and it would be a great place to view the action if a game was in progress. Breakfast was freshly cooked to order and very well presented by friendly member of staff. It also tasted very good, although I would agree with an earlier TA posting that the fresh orange juice is too expensive. With so many places to dine in the city we ate out elsewhere at lunchtime and in the evening so cannot comment on other meals in the hotel. The dining area (where we had breakfast) was modern and fairly casual. As a base we found it quite easy to walk from the hotel to the surrounding attractions - along the waterfront - The Museum of Inuit Art was worth a visit, the CN Tower and the stores. We went up the Tower twice during our stay - on day 1 it was foggy and although the view as quite limited we had a meal in the revolving restaurant which was very good. By paying for a main course (minimum order) It meant that you didn't have to wait in a queue to get up the lift or pay for entrance to the Tower. (The cost of a main course wasn't too different to the entrance fee). However the restaurant is an experience and it's unlikely that you will want to restrict yourself to the minimum order! We returned for lunch the following day when the view was much clearer - and the food and wine still as good! The waiters are all very attentive and it is one of the more \"different\" dining experiences you are likely to have (unless you live in Toronto).

We checked in about 2pm in the afternoon on a Saturday with no wait. We had a room on the 3rd floor with all the necessities including, coffee, tea, ironing board, iron, plenty of clean towels, desk and armchair. The bed was nice king-size with plenty of pillows that was comfortable. Our room had a view of the circle where the valet parking and main entrance is. I would have liked a personal safe but the room was clean and housekeeping did a great job. We never got to check out the gym in the hotel but the Bistro bar has a great look over the stadium where the Blue Jay's play. The concierge and staff was most helpful when suggesting places to eat. One place to check out is Cora's on Wellington Ave and it is in walking distance. Otherwise they do have a continental breakfast but we never got to eat there as we were there for just two days. The hotel is far from Ontario Place and some other attractions but it was not a problem. We drove most of the time and parking is reasonably cheap in Toronto. One other bit of information for those who like to Salsa dance. Got to College Street to a place called El Rancho. There is a Salsa lesson/Dinner package for $24.99 a person. The food was great and it was a lot of fun. Parking under the stadium is about 18 dollars (CAD) a day and 25 (CAD) a dollars a day with Valet service.

We went back downstairs to inform the front desk and the same guy was condecending and pretty rude because I asked for my money back for the chocolate milk. He told me he would get back to me which he never did. Chocolate milk may seem insignificant but I have been to hotels where they have bent over backwards to help you over smaller things.

Arriving and Parking If you are driving in from Gardiner Express, get off on Spadina and go North. Turn right on Front Street, then another right on Blue Jays Way. Once you are on Blue Jays Way, you should see a sign for the Renaissance hotel on your left hand side. If you would like Valet Parking ($25), turn into the hotel entrance and there should be valet attendants waiting to take your car. However, if you want to save a few bucks and do self-parking ($18), keep driving on Blue Jays Way pass the hotel entrance, turn left at the next street, then another left (essentially, you are circling the dome) until you see a big Rogers sign on the side of the stadium (near the ticketing office). At this point, on your right side, you should see a ramp going down with signs that say \"Rogers Centre parking\". This is the same parking garage as the hotel. Note that there is no sign that actually says \"Renaissance hotel parking\" or \"Hotel parking\", so it took us a while to find it. Just drive up to the security booth in front of the parking garage (they will ask to see your trunk) and go down the ramp. The garage itself is colour-coded for different parts of the stadium, so follow the signs for \"hotel\" until you get to the Purple section, then park anywhere close to the elevator that will go directly up to the hotel lobby. Check-in The check-in time was listed as 3:00pm, but when we arrived at 4:30pm, the room was still not ready. We had booked an Executive Fieldview Suite (more on rooms later), but when I checked in, the front desk receptionist tried to give me a regular Fieldview room. I explained that it was a different type of room, so she grudging said something about the room not being ready yet, and told me to wait 5 mins while she calls up house-keeping to check. I waited around for about 15 mins before my room was finally assigned properly (Room #434). While checking in, they also make you sign some type of \"waiver\" saying that 1) you will not throw objects out the window, 2) you will only have a maximum of 5 people viewing the game in your room (for regular Fieldview rooms), 6 for Executive Fieldview Suites, and 10 for Bi-Level Suites, and 3) you will check out at 10:00am if there is an afternoon game the next day (which there was), or 12:00pm otherwise. Since the website had listed the check-out time at 12:00 and we were told to leave at 10:00am (plus we had to wait around for the room to be ready during check-in), I managed to wrangle 2 free breakfast buffet vouchers out of the receptionist : ) Room The hotel has 348 rooms, but only 70 of these overlook the baseball fields. These 70 rooms are mostly on the 4th floor of the hotel, which is at the same height as the 500 level of the dome. They are on the outfield side of the field. There are 3 types of rooms: Fieldview room: These are similar to regular hotel rooms, with either one King size bed, or two double beds (sleeps maximum 4). Executive Fieldview suite (regular room + $100): These are almost the same size as the fieldview rooms, but it has some mini-stairs to take you up to a raised platform (see pictures) where you can see the game. The only advantage I can see for this is you get a bit more privacy (if you have the curtains open, the bed area is hidden). Otherwise, it's not much different from a regular room. Bi-Level suite: (regular room + $300): These suites have two levels. The first is a living room with a couch and some chairs. Upstairs is the bedroom and bathroom. We had an Executive Fieldview suite, #434. The room itself was nice and clean, with good air conditioning. The bathroom was very nice, with marble floors and countertops. There is a bathtub with shower, but no jet sprays in the tub. The bed we got was a comfortable King-size, with 3 pillows of different softness that you can choose from. Go up several steps of stairs, and there are two armchairs that face the field, plus a work desk with a phone and internet connection. Note that internet connection is not free (costs about $10 extra for 24 hours). Local calls are $1.50 per call. We also noticed that there is a coffee maker, but no fridge in the room, so if you are planning to bring some soda or beer to watch the game, freeze it before you go. The floor-to-ceiling windows had a good view of the field, and you can open the top half of the window and stick your head out. Directly below our room were several seats in the Sightlines Restaurant, and we can also see the 200 level seats and into the Blue Jays bullpen. Since the rooms are on the same side as the JumboTron, you won't be able to see what's on there during the game. However, facing out towards the field, there is a screen on the left side that shows the batter, the another screen on the right side that shows the score/outs. In addition, you can turn on the TV in the room (channel 22 is Sportsnet, 30 is TSN), and you can hear the play-by-play commentary and replays if you miss anything. Note that the broadcast has a 5 second delay so it won't exactly match up (good for catching replays, though). Food There are several restaurants located in the Rogers Centre. Windows Restaurant is inside with floor to ceiling windows where you can see the field. Sightlines Restaurant is slightly smaller, but is \"open-air\", meaning there is no window between the tables and the field. There is also a Hard Rock cafe with windows that overlook the field. In the lobby, there are also some seats where you can order a drink (and perhaps snacks), called the Arriba Restaurant. This lobby restaurant is also where the breakfast buffet is located for the complimentary breakfast in the morning. Since we wanted to watch batting practice from our room, we looked into ordering room service. As expected, the prices were pretty high ($12.95 for a roast beef sandwich), so instead of room service, we called Pizza Pizza and ordered delivery (a medium meat supreme pizza is only $15.80 including tax). They delivered directly to the hotel and front desk calls up to your room when they arrive. You just have to go down to the lobby to meet them and take it up to your room. We also had our complimentary breakfast buffet (normally the breakfast buffet costs $17.95) the next day after checking out at 10am. The \"Arriba restaurant\" is really the lobby bar and they set up a buffet table on the side. When we got there, there was a HUGE line and we ended up waiting about 30 mins for a table. Even when we left at 11am, there were still people waiting for seats, so if you're in a hurry, you may want to grab breakfast somewhere else. The saving grace is that the restaurant overlooks the field and you can watch batting practice while you're waiting. There is made-to-order omlettes, scrambled eggs, sausage links, bacon, waffles, potato wedges, fruits, yogurt, muffins, and bagels. The orange juice and coffee is also included. We thought the breakfast was pretty good, but wouldn't pay $17.95 for it if it wasn't included. Summary We had an awesome time! Being able to watch batting practice and the whole game from our room was a really cool experience. In fact, this hotel is the only hotel in the world that's built into a stadium. Other than a brief mix-up during check-in, our stay was great and very memorable. We definitely recommend shelling out the extra bucks for a room, especially if you're a baseball fan. It'll be an experience you'll never forget.

I booked a club level room and was assured the additional services and amenities more than made up for the price difference between this and a standard room. First of all, I had requested an early check in and when I arrived at 1:00pm they did not have a room ready for me - this was okay, I understand that they can accept a request only if they can accommodate it on the day of arrival. I left my bags with the concierge and went off to my meeting, when I arrived back at the hotel at 4:00pm, I was told my room was still not ready! Regular check in without a request for early check in is supposed to be at 3:00pm! By this time I was a bit tired and just wanted to relax. Finally, at almost 5:00pm I was told that my room was finally ready. I went up to the club floor (6) and found my room. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this room was nothing to write home about. It was quite small and very sparsley furnished. I looked for the mini bar but there wasn't one - not even a small fridge to store soda in. I called down and asked for a fridge and they sent one up which looked beat up and about 10 years old. Aside from the above, the hotel lobby was lovely and there are plenty of areas to see the Rogers Centre and baseball field. I enjoyed the complimentary snacks and drinks in the 6th floor concierge lounge, BUT, and that's a big but - I piled my dishes and glasses outside my door starting the day I checked in, and the same dishes and glasses ( with a few added over 2 days) were still there the day I checked out! I cannot believe the number of employees that passed by this hallway and did not remove the dirty dishes! Not only that, I had turn down service so I know someone had to have seen these dishes and basically ignored them. Had I known where to turn these in I would have done it myself.

The front desk clerk was friendly and welcoming and answered any questions we had. We opted for self parking ($18 CAN per night)and I was very happy with that. The parking area was easy to find and get to, it was covered, and was safe. There is access from the the self park area right to the hotel so you don't have to go outside or anything. Our room was nice. The bathroom was very large, clean, and brightly lit. We were put on the first floor, which was kind of annoying, since if we opened the curtains, everyone entering and leaving the hotel would be able to see everything. Oh well, we booked through Priceline and got a good deal. The pool area was average. You have to go down the first elevator and down a seperate elevator to get to the pool (just including this info. in case you need it). We called down to the pool to ask where it was located and the person who answered at that desk told us they couldn't answer that question for us and we would have to call the front desk. Didn't really understand that, but whatever. Oh, and the whirlpool bath was lukewarm at best. There are 2 saunas as well. I thought this hotel was a bit far from the subway, that is my one big complaint. It took us about 15 minutes to walk from the hotel to the Union Station stop. But, you walk through the Entertainment District so the walk is not too bad. All in all, it was a nice stay, the service was friendly and unobtrusive, and I would be happy to stay again!", "Date": "October 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "detroit", "Title": "\u201cLiked the room hated the service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3933955", "Content": "I travel to Toronto on business quite often but I had never stayed at the Renaissance. I thought since I was travelling to toronto with my family rather than for work, we would stay at this hotel. My kids liked the idea that it was close to the CN Tower. I would never stay at this hotel again. I thought the front desk employees were friendly and unwelcoming. I asked who the manager on duty would be so I could voice my opinion on the bad service we received and the manager on duty clearly heard me because she looked over at me and then walked away. I guess she didn't want to deal with customers that day. I found the reception to be unwelcoming. my business was clearly unappreciated.

The front desk even put forth a lot of extra effort to help find the best room for our situation. The room we had a feild veiw which was very nice. Our 3 days there went by quickly & we would've stayed longer but we were on a shedule & Niagra Falls was the next stop which your staff helped find us a room there too. We had a small mix up with the bill when checking out but even this was quickly corrected. Our stay here was perfect & we hope to be back soon for the Raptor's / Cavalier's besketball game.

Well to make a short story of it, i brought several hundred dollars with me. When i went out on saturday night, i left the bulk of my cash in the room instead of carry it on me,, the room by the way has no safe in it. Who knew that when i returned later that night $500 would be taken from my room.. I was told there was a bed turn down service on the club floor where i was on,,,, and that their staff came it to turn down my bed,,, but did that have to include my cash being taken,,, all of it. the hotel management even tried to suggest that maybe when i left the room , my door didnt close all the way and someone maybe walking by enterred,,, yeah right. all i know i am out lots of money, no phone call from the general manager after 3 days, and no offer of any sort of compensation. i would not recomend this hotel, because if the staff did indeed take my cash, what would they do to your stuff??", "Date": "September 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener, Onatrio, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAverage At Best\u201d", "Author": "cold_in_kitchener", "ReviewID": "UR3893074", "Content": "We recently returned from a 1 night stay at the Renaissance and were not overly impressed.

Also, the room was not overly clean, as pieces of garbage were on the floor and we found hair on the pillows and in the bathroom. Check-in was a hassle and very time consuming. Staff were less than helpful and seemed to not know what they were doing. Parking is expensive, and food is expensive. Do not waste your money and eat in the hotel restaurants.

It was a great stay but as previosly mentioned it has no soul!!!! The people at the front desk were very nice and the concierge (i know i spelled that wrong ...but oh well) was exceptional by giving us a free breakfast and a 50% refund when she recomended a tour for us in which the double decker bus broke down on the way back!!!! The valet is another story!!! When my wife went to valet and asked that the car be brought up so that she can retrieve some valuables from it she was told that she could have done that herself!!!!!!! Also, the pool area is kinda nasty!!!! The ceiling has falling paint chips and the floor is moldy \"yikes!!\" . While we were in the pool one day the pool guy dipped his dirty bucket in the pool that he used to scrubb the shower area!!!!(pretty nasty)..........Other then that we had a cool stay here. We were upgraded to a Jr. Suite with a stadium veiw for free (no game but it was still a cool view). To me this hotel is more like a three star than a four!!!
