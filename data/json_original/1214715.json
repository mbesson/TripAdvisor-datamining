I booked this hotel because it had been built only a yeat before out stay, but we couldn't tell by our experience. Check in went well. Then we unloaded the luggange onto the cart.... The luggage cart had a broken wheel. I reported it to the front desk and their response to that was they already knew. Noone bothered to tell us. Complete hassel getting to the room. We attempted to go swimming, the pool area was like a steam room, and we couldn't breath, not to mention the over powering smell of chlorine. The hand rail in the pool area was broken, which is a safety hazard. The rooms were decent and we thaught it was cool that the speakers to the TV went into the bathroom, but thats about it. After a long day sight seeing wanting nothing more than to get in out room, our key didn't work, both nights of our stay. When we asked for help on directions or any other assistance. The staff was rude or just told us to use the buisness center. No extra help was offered. If you are going to Dallas, I strongly suggest that you find another hotel.

However, DO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND when you check out or you will not get it back. I had a lock and cable for my suit case and I'm sure I forgot it in my room.

Check-in was quick and easy. We had an issue with our Priority Club account (totally our fault, not theirs), and the employee fixed it with no problem. The room was at a comfortable temperature when we arrived and everything looked clean. It was a nice, spacious room with 2 queens. We forgot toothpaste, but we were able to get a free travel size one from the front desk! I was so thankful for that! I had one of the best nights sleep I've had in a long time (I'm a new first time mom) and there were no noise disturbances from other guests. Although we were late coming down for breakfast, there were still items left out, so we were able to eat a little something before we headed home. I was surprised because hotels normally put everything away right away. Check-out was a breeze as well. Our only complaint was that the coffee pot wasn't working, but, luckily, there was coffee in the lobby.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel - not so good location\u201d", "Author": "ron3573", "ReviewID": "UR68128840", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel because it was reserved for our family reunion. As mentioned in other reviews the hotel can easily be a 4 star if it was in a different location. The location is the biggest con with the hotel. It's somewhat isolated off a service road, but the hotel is nice. It's fairly new with features you may see in hotel such has door bells, climate control, automated privacy signals, granite, 32\" LCD TV and sound in the bathroom from the TV to name a few. I got a suite and it provides a little more room and a sofa bed if you need it. The first night was good, but the second night had a bunch a young adults who wanted to party all night.
