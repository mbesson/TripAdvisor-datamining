Small rooms, but generally clean and tidy, and I have found the staff generally helpful, breakfast OK and restaurant also OK, serving hearty German food. BUT this time, I hit a big snag. I was given a single room (as booked) on the fourth floor and turned in for a night's sleep. No chance. The bed had seen better days. The mattress was soft and lumpy and the divan base uneven with signs of the springing giving way. The bed hardly looked like it was made to 'hotel specification' - it seemed like a cheap insubstantial domestic bed. I admit I like a firm bed, but this was impossible. Finished up wrapping myself up in the duvet and sleeping on the floor, Japanese style. The next morning, I asked to be moved to another room - and was moved immediately to another similar room -without question. The bed was better and usable, but still rather soft and saggy. I suspect these beds have not been renewed since the last refurbishment some years ago. When I left after my 3-day stay, I pointed out to the receptionist the comments I had made about this problem on the hotel's comment card - she didn't seem too surprised to hear my comments (!), and she told me that some beds have been renewed recently. It would seem the staff know there is a problem. But the management need to get this sorted out.

Even with earplugs in! Don't know if this is a problem particular to room 322 or not since few other reviews note a noise problem. It has made for a miserable stay, though, and has cast a bit of a pall over my first visit to Berlin as I've felt tired all the time. I don't consider myself a light sleeper and have never had a problem like this on any of my travels before. Maybe it's worse with all the groups of young adults who seem to be here for New Year's and keep popping in and out of each other's rooms. It's a real shame, though, as I wanted to like this hotel. It was super-easy to get to, even late at night, the room was quite spacious for a single and the breakfast was plentiful. The free WiFi was useful, though I've come to realise that when continental hotels boast of satellite or cable tv, that just means they have BBC news. I've tried as a result to be fair in my scoring - except for the internal noise problem, this hotel would have suited me fine. Ultimately, though, if I can't count on getting a good night's sleep, that's a deal-breaker. If I hadn't prepaid, I'd have checked out after the first night.

The hotel was surrounded by lots of shops (to suit all tastes), along with various bars and restaurants with various foods, including Chinese, Italian, Spanish, Mexican and (of course) English. There was a nice pub next door (nice Berlin beer) and next to that was a lovely showroom of my favourite cars - Mercedes Benz. The hotel staff were friendly on arrival, although the lady that checked us in really should smile a bit more! The rest were great however, including the Restaurant staff. Breakfast had a really nice & relaxed feeling and the breakfast buffet was nice, with a choice of scrambled or boiled eggs, bacon, various breads, cheese, cold meats, cereals, fruit juice etc. The bedrooms are very clean and comfortable, towels and linen changed daily and plenty of soap & toileteries. There is the facility to watch blockbuster movies on tv (in English) or normal tv (in German). What really surprised me is the free wireless Internet access throughout the hotel. You even get free Internet on your tv with a wireless keyboard provided as standard in your bedroom AND the use of the safety deposit box in your room was also free! The only down side was there was no air conditioning in the room, which became quite unbearable on a hot day (32 degrees). At night it was very warm in the room as well as humid.

They have a decent restaurant just off the lobby, and while they don't do room service (contrary to what the hotel information book in the room says), you can order something and go down to pick it up and take back to your room. One thing I didn't realize until the end of my stay was that there is a grocery store just down the street, so if you don't want to pay minibar charges, you can go buy your own water and snacks. As far as location, this was a nice neighborhood and convenient to the subway, restaurants, shopping, etc. I was a female traveling alone, and I felt perfectly safe walking around there at night. The room was about the normal size for Europe (i.e. small), but very clean and with a window that could open. I didn't hear any noise from outside. The walls are a little thin, though, so if you're a light sleeper, you might want to bring ear plugs to protect you from your neighbor's late-night television, discussions, etc. I stayed there for business and then a few days being a tourist.

We parked our car in their car park and were able to travel all over the city using the excellent public transport system. The hotel is bright and welcoming with both modern and traditional features. As with all German hotels, it was spotlessly clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. And forget about British city hotel prices (especially London) - I booked online and could hardly believe what a great deal we got. We have stayed at literally hundreds of hotels over the years and I have to say that the buffet breakfasts, served in the lovely light and airy dining room, were the best we have ever had. The choice of bread, rolls, cold meats, cheeses, pates, fresh fruit, yoghurts, fruit juices etc were mind boggling and there were also hot boiled eggs and hot English type breakfast items on offer. We just couldn't believe our luck! It's worth mentioning also that they serve breakfast for absolutely ages (I think it was 7:30 am until 10:00 am) so it never got too crowded. We stayed for six nights and had some evening meals in the rustic German style restaurant and \"al fresco\" as the weather was so good. The food was great and excellent value - again the service was very friendly and they serve meals until very late. It was our first visit to Berlin since 1985 so of course it had changed a lt since then. Many people think Berlin is a bit of strange place to go on holiday but I can't recommend it highly enough - there is absolutely loads to do and see - we didn't get to everything by any means - travelling on the buses, underground, overground trains, trams and boats is very easy and one of the season tickets for use on all the public transport systems is a must. After leaving Berlin centre we also had a 3 night stay in Potsdam so I'll give that place a plug while I am at it - do go on an open bus tour round there - its well worth it (especially if you get the same guide we had - she was brilliant!). And a tip for any visitors to the Schloss Sanssouci - you don't need to climb up all those steps - you can get a bus from the bus station which drops you off at the top - I found this out the day after we climbed the steps in the blazing sun and 37 degrees temperature!!
