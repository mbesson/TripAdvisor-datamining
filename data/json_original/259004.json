The young boys were making very inappropriate comments to our girls, calling their rooms in the middle of the night, etc. After we were informed of this, we asked the front desk to do something. They replied, \"Boys will be boys.\" The kids continued their behavior, forcing us to sit in the hallway outside our girls' rooms until almost 4 in the morning when the boys finally stopped roaming the halls and went to bed. Maybe that is how young boys treat young girls in Italy, but we were not going to allow our girls to be treated that way.

When we reached the hotel though, after one train jurney from Fiuminino to Termini, one metro jurney from there to Ananina - the last station and one late bus from here to the hotel, the receptionist said our credit card was not valid so they had to cancel the reservation.

We booked it as a last minute thing, so had limited options when choosing a hotel. Booked Hotel Petra as 1. It had a room available 2. It looked great on the website 3.It was (just) within our budget. Firstly, yes, it's miles from Rome - to get there from the city itself you must get the metro to the furthest stop, Anagnina which takes 20-25 mins from the main terminal (the Metro is clean & efficient and a 75 min pass only costs 1 euro from the machine) from there to the hotel you have 2 options, the number 46 bus which runs every 15 mins and drops off 150 metres from the hotel, or the local taxis - DO NOT use these unless your very tired or in a desperate rush as they are a rip off ! The first time we were charged 13 euros for what is about a 2 mile journey and the second time the driver shot off at 80 mph in the wrong direction! After i protested he turned around, took us to the hotel but still insisted on taking 15 euros from me. The Hotel offers a shuttle bus, this is not, as it states, a free service. You can use it at 9am or 10.15 in the morning and twice again in the evening, and that's it. We were told by the receptionist, who was rude and abrupt with us throughout the stay, that this service was at a cost of 5 euros per person each way. We used it the first day, until we found the bus, there were 6 people in the shuttle bus that day, all paying 5 euros each so the 30 euros they made for the 2 mile trip made the taxis look reasonable!! First impressions of the Hotel, it needs a make-over and a gardener - all a bit shabby but the pool area is nice and once you're in, the reception is clean & tidy. As mentioned, the receptionist was rude, un helpful and abrupt but the bar staff and waitresses ( they have to do both jobs so if the restaurant is busy don't stand at the bar - you will have a long wait) ! were pleasant and helpfull. Felt sorry for them, they are woefully understaffed, three staff must have done 120 meals that night and as i say, had to look after the bar as well ! We booked B&B but on checking into the hotel the receptionist said breakfast was to be charged extra untill i argued otherwise and he backed down. Also tried to charge us 5 euros each when i asked for a towell for the pool, later saying it was just a deposit when we questioned this charge. The rooms are ok, think old style travel lodge without the tea/coffe making facilities, small, but clean & tidy and they have a balcolny with poolside view if thats your fancy. Breakfast was typical continental but with a good choice and decent selection of teas/coffees. Evening meal, expensive, but Italy is. The food it self was delicious, had Carbonara & Fillet steak, the steak was fantastic and their was a good choice of local wines. We ate there twice but we found a great little Pizzeria about 250 meters away, difficult to find but if you ask, someone will direct you, it's literaly the only place nearby to eat but it's where all the locals go.

The area we drove through to get to it was less than desirable but thought it would be better by day. We asked the hotel receptionist for advice on transport to Rome and were given info and a map. Dinner on the first night was less than satisfactory - ordered grilled chicken and that is just what you got - a piece of chicken on a plate and nothing else - luckily ordered chips too. Used the bus and metro to get into Rome the next day - the hotel sold tickets which lasted 75 mins for 1 euro, and we bought a weekly ticket from Anagnina metro station which served all buses, metros and trams for just 16 Euros each - good value. The info given to us about metros etc by the hotel was incorrect - they said the last metro from Rome was 9pm then it changed to a bus - it's actually 11:30pm! Due to being told this we got taxis home the first 2 nights until we discovered the truth. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere really - taxi drivers in Rome don't know how to get there - one used an a-z whilst driving (as if Italian driving isn't bad enough) and the other used his sat nav. Taxi costs varied between 28 and 35 Euros depending on which way they went. The pool area was good - good sun loungers and 3 big umbrellas at one end of the pool, and it was secure - had to use key card to get in. The pool is a decent size and is quite deep - I\u2019m 5'11\" and don't swim, but when I stepped off the last step the water was over my shoulders - another foot or so into the pool and it was up to my neck. We didn't eat at the hotel for the rest of the week until the Friday when we ordered some chips in the bar - very helpful girl on the bar - brought them to us with sauces etc. Different story the next day when a young guy was on - said it wasn't possible to have food in bar - have to eat in restaurant but then have to pay 1.5 Euros each service charge! Already unhappy, we went back to our room to get things ready for our departure the next day, when we went into the room safe to find 160 Euros missing! Reception called the manager who offered to pay for the meal we'd had on our first night and our taxi back to the airport (instead of another meal which they had offered and we declined). They told us to go to the police station and gave us directions, but when we asked for them to call them out to the hotel we were offered a lift there - guess they didn't want the police at the hotel! Still no idea what happened to the money. The rooms are clean with a nice balcony area, TV which only has 2 channels in English - both news channels, hairdryer in bathroom was good - didn't even need to use my travel dryer. Not sure what time the room attendants started but our room was never ready before 3 or 4pm each day. Overall, staff were friendly, pool was clean, and rooms were clean. Maybe a bit far from Rome if you want to go in during day and back at night as you do spend a lot of time waiting for buses etc, but it is good if you want to do sightseeing for a few days and then spend time chilling by the pool.", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hastings, England", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Petra\u201d", "Author": "judelewis64", "ReviewID": "UR18018354", "Content": "Everything you need in a hotel, clean, helpful staff, and a nice restaurant.

The area in fact is not too bad; the Italian habit of spraying graffiti and litter over everything makes it look a great deal worse than it is. But neither is it romantic, glamorous or atmospheric: rather, a characteristically anonymous Roman suburb in the outer belt (i.e. lots of 1960s apartment blocks, relatively few shops or restaurants, and plenty of busy four-lane roads). It is, I think, best suited for people looking for a convenient and decent-value stopping-place for Ciampino airport. To get there from the airport, the simplest way is to take the CO.TRA.L or A.TRA.L 'bus from the arrivals terminal to Anagnina station (10-15 min.), then switch to the 046 city 'bus that will take you to Via del Ponte di Sette Miglia (6-7 min.). This will deposit you almost outside the front door. It's a short taxi trip, but Roman taxi drivers are almost incredibly ignorant of the geography of their own city. Though the straight-line distance is also fairly short, walking is, alas, impossible: you would be travelling along a divided highway with no walkway and overgrown vegetation forcing you into high-speed oncoming traffic every 50 metres or so. The hotel itself is a typical Italian 4-stelle: large if simply-furnished bedrooms with bath and balcony; plenty of conference rooms; and a pool that doesn't seem to be in use in the winter-time. The breakfast is excellent, with a wide selection of items. I didn't try the restaurant: but with the exception of a couple of indifferent-looking trattorie and pizzerie, there aren't too many alternatives within walking distance. Because of the distance from central Rome, I wouldn't recommend the Petra as a tourist base. If you have a hire car and are exploring the area to the south (Castelgandolfo, etc.) then it might do nicely, if you're prepared to sacrifice ambience for value.

We won`t go back there !", "Date": "March 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean Hotel to stay in\u201d", "Author": "fr1n3ine", "ReviewID": "UR6481167", "Content": "We have just returned from Rome, and i can honestly say, stay at the Petra Hotel, i was amazed with the service provided by the staff, it took about 30 mins to get in the town but too be honest it wasnt a problem at all, the Metro is very cheap 1Euro to travel on the bus and train, the bus stop is 2seconds walk and it takes you straight to the train station where you will find a a fab market to purchase makeup, coats, shoes really cheap, definitly recommend the market before going on the train you will find definitly find bargins there. The train station is very simple to find your way round as you will see english translations to exits and enter signs i was very impressed with the trip. The hotel was very nice, the rooms were very clean we had a balcony which was very nice because being in Dec we still had the sun bleeming in, becareful with using the shutters as it makes the room very dark and in the morning you never know what time it is because its pitch black, but if you want to sleep in, i recommend you use it because it is nice ha ha We had a mini bar in the room which i thought it was going to be expensive but when i got the bill and the end of the trip it was seriously nothing, it was so cheap and the breakfast there was lovely. If you are looking to go to Rome, stay at the Petra Hotel because you can get cheap cab fare back to the airport which cost us 50euros and on the way there it cost us 80euros but thats understanable. If you choose Petra Hotel dont take the location into account because you are only going back there to sleep and then out in the day in Rome. The area is very quiet and clean.", "Date": "December 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, UK", "Title": "\u201cNot bad... but also not great!\u201d", "Author": "Lanny_fa", "ReviewID": "UR6087226", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights. The outside of the hotel seemed nice. The interior and cleanliness of the hotel is excellent. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly. As the hotel was on the outer part of Rome hardly anyone knew how to speak English - but at least tried to be a bit helpful. The breakfast was delightful and very well presented. The dinner which was served was delicious but the service was pretty poor. To start with we were served on time, friendly and in a professional manner but over the period of our time there, the service seemed to lack more and more. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was the right temperature. The balcony was great, except the view was a bit poor. Overall if I went there again I wouldn't be staying there again. It was an ok hotel to stay for a few days but the food seemed tedious and there wasn't much to do to keep me entertained the whole week.", "Date": "November 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Just America", "Title": "\u201cTerrible\u201d", "Author": "LovingAmerica", "ReviewID": "UR5880626", "Content": "We recently stayed at this hotel and found hardly anyone speaks english and has no intrest in doing so!

St Peters is a 15 minute bus ride away then a 17 stop metro ride away, the metro stops running at 9.30pm and there is no cheap way of getting back to the hotel unless you want to spend approx \u00a370 to \u00a3120 Euros to get back to the hotel. There is no information to advise you of this as we found out from another english tourist at the hotel and had it confirmed by a local taxi driver.

The hotel looks OK from web photos and info but in reality was a bit shabby, reception attitude and service varied from 'basic minimum' to 'completely disinterested' depending on who you saw. Worst thnig is that room air conditioning was totally useless, completely ineffectual. We could not open windows for security reasons, the rooms have metal shutters which notices suggest you keep closed whenever possible. So we spent a very hot and claustrophobic night. Somehow our 3 year old managed to get to sleep, if it wasn't for that we would have been camped by reception till they did something (even a mattress in reception would have been better). Reception staff were more interested in something on their computer screen in the morning than our check-out, whether we enjoyed our stay, all that basic stuff. On the positive side, the restaurant was actually OK, reasonably wide menu, food OK, service pretty good from young staff. The inclusive buffet breakfast was very basic quality. We were very glad to leave in the morning and would rather have slept at the airport. Next time we will either organised a later flight (so we don't need to stay so close) or fly from Rome's main airport where there must be better quality hotels.", "Date": "September 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, poor customer service\u201d", "Author": "myTXchica", "ReviewID": "UR3942238", "Content": "Our experience was mixed in that the hotel itself was nice.

There were other little things too such as trying to book a shuttle to get us back to Ciampino airport which was going to run a hefty 50 euros and they left on their schedule not yours which was inconvenient for out flight time, but the overall stay was good.
