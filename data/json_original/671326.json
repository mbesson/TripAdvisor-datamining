I stayed at the Por Santa Maria for one night only and had been looking for a central budget accomodation, basically I just wanted a clean and well-located place to sleep one night.The location is fabulous (just very few steps from Piazza della Signoria and Uffizi) and my room as well as the shared bathroom were very clean.Unfortunately, I hardly got any sleep because it was just so noisy. Noise was coming from the corridor, but more importantly from the street. I could hear every drunkward singing on the street (it was Saturday night) as if they were walking through my room and in the early morning, the garbage-trucks arrived. Windows and shutters were closed but didn't help at all.As all I wanted from this hotel was a good night's sleep, I was quite disappointed and I probably wouldn't return, in spite of the location, low price and nice reception staff. If you're using earplugs and don't mind the noise, everything else was fine.", "Date": "Sep 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR216539318", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nemorino79"}, {"Content": "A very happy return. Having been very satisfied when I stayed at this Hotel in May ( for one week), I have just returned from another spendid week, and am delighted to offer these thoughts for prospective travellers to Florence. This unpretentious Hotel is wonderfully located within minutes walking of the two main piazzas, museums and galleries, the river, the shops, the Duomo, and a host of restaurants. The main Railway station is ten minutes walk, but a taxi stand is nearby. The Owners personally manage the Hotel, which is scrupulously clean in all areas. Tha absence of a breakfast facility should not deter: two or three very good `cafes` are within 100 mtrs, where local business and market people create an atmosphere of real life ( as opposed to tourism artificiality). The Hotel facilities are modest but perfectly adequate, and the Owners are lovely people, willing to help with advice when asked. Security is no problem in my experience.In terms of value for money, it would be difficult to find better.I am hooked. for my four annual visits to this dream city.", "Date": "Aug 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR807281485", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Charlino"}, {"Content": "Fanastic location The family who run this accommodation are lovely, very helpful. I cannot stress how clean the rooms are. We booked as budget accommodation and couldn`t fail to be impressed with the location and service. We had a double room with shower cubical in corner and sink and shared toilet. If you don`t want to spend a fortune then this is the place. As it is very central you can hear the hustle and bustle of life. We had mobile air con unit in the room. We paid 140 euro for 2 nights in double room - nothing fancy but suited us. It is on the fourth floor of a residential building accessed by a lift. It is room only. I would have no hesitation in recommending this accommodation.", "Date": "Sep 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR276979615", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "joanne_brooks"}, {"Content": "Credevo di aver prenotato una...   showReview(22232821, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR304182548", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "El Hotel por Santa Maria, esta...   showReview(21616978, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR565362312", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "El hotel es limpio y esta muy...   showReview(20890683, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR101067368", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Chambre propres, gens tr\u732bs...   showReview(16731912, 'full');", "Date": "May 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR493396242", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "H\u4e48tel tr\u732bs bien situ\u8305...   showReview(16730750, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR639566776", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "La camera era accogliente e...   showReview(16728390, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR269891844", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "E' un hotel che vale la pena di...   showReview(16728388, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR441007492", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d671326-r20830690-Hotel_Por_Santa_Maria-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "671326", "Price": "$108"}}
