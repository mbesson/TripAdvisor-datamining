{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Reality check To begin, Mariners Court is not one of those places you take public transportation to, get off and you're right in front of it. At the airport we got travel passes that included unlimited bus, ferry and rail. We went to Kings Cross station, exited on Victoria St and carried the bags down a couple of LONG flights of stairs. Don't do this. I recommend getting off at Circular Quay and then transferring to the Bus 311. This drops you off right in front of McElhone St. That's IF you want to stay here...The owners were a contradiction of friendliness and panderers. They made us feel like we were in complete error in getting the transport passes (which we got value from!) and should've hauled in on a taxi. They questioned our reasoning for getting the family room with three guys travelling. The proprietress simply said you don't have children and are you family? When I made initial enquiry on their website which is very user unfriendly and not very detailed, I originally requested there would be 3 adults staying. I was informed on a response email that I would have to book the family room. I only accepted what was offered to me. To be questioned upon checkin we were made to feel in error. They did honor the booking, however it was a distasteful experience. The family room is broken up into 2 rooms, one a master room done up quite nicely, the other room with 3 beds really needed a paint job and a bit more character. The bathrooms were very dated and a previous reviewer hit it spot on, this was a renewed old folks home with all the handle bars in the shower and wrap around shower curtain. Mold everywhere on the ceiling and that sliding door contraption with no lock. Beds were comfortable enough. Sufficient towels and linens.The breakfast on the 1st floor is alright. They had a great coffee machine. Toast, boiled eggs, peach slices, cereal, yogurt, juices, milk, jams and butter. They usually would throw in one special item that was different for each day such as watermelon, coldcuts/cheese, etc but were not there every day. The elevators are slow, memories of visiting grandfather in the home...the neighborhood is a bit alarming. We saw a couple laying in a cardboard box one day shooting up with needles. We also saw stray needles along the path (beware if you wear flipflops or open toe shoes!) to the stairs up to Potts Point. It has an old town feel and a worn down urbanity. I did like the Frisco Hotel pub around the corner. Great meals for cheap $10 but beware they can be small, albeit tasty. Good beer too. Tried the meatpies at Harry's little shack across the street. They were OK. I saw a photo of Col. Sanders eating there from KFC fame..the mashed potatoes and gravy plus peas they put called a Tiger is not far from that KFC taste. Be sure to explore Potts Point above Woolloomooloo. They have a wide variety of choices for all socio-economical prices. Mixture of chic, porn, backpackers, bar scene... etc...international cuisine. Oxford Street and Darlinghurt are also good escapes. I disliked this property mainly because of the owners. They seemed to kind of help but it was in a very stodgy way. Very much a look down mentality on their guests. If I wanted to be judged I would go to a real court instead of Mariners Court. I avoided them throughout the stay.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR493067266", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "boxjelly"}, {"Content": "Great place to stay!

We walked back late at night on one occasion and I felt slightly uneasy, though we were fine.On another occasion we walked to the Kings Cross Train station which wasn't far.There are several restaurants close by, and on our last night we stumbled upon Potts Point which also had god restaurants and a good atmoshpere, we would have liked to have returned there.All in all this hotel is fantastic value for money being MUCH cheaper than most.

The main problem with this hotel is the atmosphere - it's a former nursing home that the current owner/s haven't spent a lot of money converting to a hotel. It's very beige, with wide doors and corridors for wheelchairs and trolleys, and emergency buttons still in the rooms and showers. The pictures on the walls reminded me of a doctor's waiting room. If you look closely, you can see the rear entrance where the ambulances would collect/drop off patients/residents. I read on a website it's a heritage building - but it looked 1970s/80s to me.The staff were OK - quite helpful and friendly - but not really apologetic that our booking was mucked up (at their end) - which meant we had to move rooms. One room was OK but the next had a hairdryer that didn't work and a door that only locked from the outside. The rooms were clean enough, but the bathrooms looked a bit tired and the shower tiles needed a good scrub.We were there in late summer and the place was pretty airless and stuffy. There is aircon and fans. You could open the doors to get air, but every night but one there seemed to be guests smoking in the courtyard/s, although the whole place is meant to be a non-smoking.The breakfast was OK and the location of the hotel is good, but I would be careful walking around this area late at night - it's still known for muggings - although I suppose that happens in many inner areas in large cities.This place was full when we were there, and the price must be the main attraction - we paid around AUD120 for a room and breakfast which was very good value for central Sydney. There are pubs/clubs/restaurants close and the harbour is just down the road. The city centre and its attractions are only a short walk.If you want atmosphere this is NOT your place - but for price and location it's a good option.", "Date": "Mar 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR910659633", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tongi"}, {"Content": "Great value for money Stayed for 4 nights at this small friendly hotel. We thought it was a good location and the walk through the botanical gardens to the city centre a bonus. The location was fine and close to the 'up and coming' Woolamaloo area. it was also close to Kings Cross area and we felt that was OK too. All in all no probs with location - OK it's not in darling harbour, it hasn't got a view of the opera house/Harbour bridge but at the end of the end how often do you sit in your room all day looking at the 'sights'??? No...you end up sightseeing!!The hotel owners were extremely helpful and when we arrived early morning we were immediately booked into a room - a blessing after a long flight. Breakfast was good too - you can have breakfast al fresco weather permitting. The owners were extremely accomodating. This accomodation was good value for money in an expensive city. You are close to trendy Fingers Wharf and the famous 'Harry de Wheels' pie van. If we were in Sydney we would stay here again.

Bearing in mind that this is a budget hotel, the rooms are of adequate size, and well equipped, with a small balcony. The breakfast, which comes as part of the deal, is excellent value. The area is quiet, but also one of those parts of Sydney that hasn't abandoned any character under the impact of tourism: there are some excellent, and in the case of The Old Fitzroy, mildly quirky, pubs close to hand (the latter having a terrific and extremely reasonably priced bistro).
