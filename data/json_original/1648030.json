Richard told us upon check in that the pool was being worked on & since we were almost directly on the beach it was OK. He did tell us that the pool will be ready in a few weeks which will make this very cozy & quiet Inn a favorite for us. We will be back!!

Met the 2 owners who not only had compassion for the BS that we had just been through but also allowed us to check out at 4 for a little extra cash. The room was clean, cute and simple. Nothing too flashy but nothing outdated either and very reasonable for a beach front stay. The price of this compared to everything else was incredible.. I even told the owner he should raise their price when big events are in town like that weekend. He said that he might but he wanted to provide value until the pool was remolded.
