Everything is inclusive, room service, restaurants, and snacks. I would very much recommend the Kids Club for your children. They go bungee jumping (for free) and I got to watch my 11, 10, 7, and 4 year old jump on it (I do also have a 16 year old) . The two Kids Club staff members that your should look for are Claudia and Nadia. Those two staff members made my children laugh and have the time of their lives. It was truly like they were there parents that were fun and energetic. In the pool there is a inflatable obstacle course that my children would have a blast on! They would race and do a sort of Hunger Games battle where they would try to be the last one standing and nobody gets hurt! There are also two other staff members that were the best as well! Guilliman and Matin. Guilliman was the towel shack member at the family concierge and he would bring a big smile to my children's face. He taught them how to yo-yo and preform the Mexican Tornado. He is really amazing. Martin is the teen entertainment and my 16 year old adored him. She would get out and play water polo with the other teens at the pool. Because of Martin, she made a posse that would roam around at night. She would dance and have the best time. I would say the entertainment at night lacks just a bit because there is no kid show, the only show is at 9:30 and my younger kids would have already been asleep. Every 2 months I think there is a Lion King production and all of my kids were asked to participate. My eldest and her posse, and my littles. They had costumes, make-up, and only one rehearsal, but it turned out really great! I would suggest going to this magnificent place!", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cFrom a Teen's Perspective\u201d", "Author": "ArthurHGW", "ReviewID": "UR126610758", "Content": "I am 16 years old and came with my family to the playa del carmen paradisus for spring break. I had been to the paradisus in the dominican republic 2 years ago. This hotel reminded me of the \"W\" hotels in that it had a very metropolitan feel. Although there are no activities clubs for those ages 12+, the staff was very good about activities during the day. Water polo, beach volleyball, and water basketball were some of the everyday activities offered at the resort. I particularly came to know Martin, Carlos, and Giovani who were awesome! Recognizing a lack in night entertainment for kids, Martin, with the help of Giovani, took an initiative to throw a teen \"disco,\" which turned out to be the highlight of my trip. Another really cool guy was Gillman who worked at the family concierge pool, and was always genuinely eager to start a conversation with you. For any kids going to this paradisus, I would definitely look for these guys as they make the vacation 100 times better! The food was also unbelievable. My favorite place was Toji, the japanese cuisine restaurant. The sushi was SO good. Some of the best sushi I've ever had- it was fresh and creatively displayed in the dishes. Overall I had an awesome vacation, but it wouldn't have been so awesome if it hadn't been for Martin, Carlos, Giovani, and Gillman.

We didn't have a great experience here, but it wasn't terrible. Things I Liked 1. Pool Area is wonderful. There are lots of seats, lots of cabanas, lots of towels, lots of toys and floats to borrow. There is no one bugging you to join activities . . .but then there are no planned activities. Someone stops by regularly to check for drinks and food. A basic all inclusive grill/bar is right next door for filling hungry bellies. 2. Resort is aesthetically pleasing. Lots of neat modern furniture and decor. 3. Other Guests - No rowdy guests here. Really nice families and not too crowded. 4. Family Concierge Pool - It was heated and quieter, a nice change. 5. Restaurants - Tons to choose from and food was decent/better than your average AI. 6. Climate - Not as humid and sweltering hot as caribbean. Things that royally ticked me off 1. I was told that Family Concierge meant that I would have a helper w/the kids for the entire trip. Not true. FC means that your at a hotel far away from everything w/someone who is constantly asking how you're enjoying your trip and if there's anything they can do for you. It means he's knocking at your door as your getting your 3 kids in a bath offering you strawberry scented pillows. It means you have to listen to them explain to you where the safe and light switches are located in your room when you arrive at the hotel. It means you have access to a private pool and private grill area. - Not worth it. 2. Guest Services - As soon I figured out that FC was not worth the money and the room was way too tiny for our family, I complained to Guest Services that I wanted a room change. They explained to me that I would have to pay 70 usd per head - 350 a day to switch to a different room (travelocity the rooms are 30 usd more). It took 4 days to get a room change as each day I was told they would get back to me since we didn't like our room and see if they could get a better deal. Another day I was told that the room I wanted only came w/ a King Bed. We are finally in a room w/double beds and living room w/pull out sofa. It works much better for us and I highly recommending book this should you choose to go here. 3. The main reason we came was b/c Paradisus told me that this location was ideal for young children. NOT TRUE!!! The kids camp is divided into 4 yrs - 1 yr Baby Club and 5-12 yrs. The baby club watches TV and has access to about 5 block sorters and a bunch of stuffed animals. There are cribs for naps. For about 4 days of the vacation they moved the baby club into a hotel room where the kids could play in a small living area and watch TV. Needless to say none of them wanted to come. To be fair, the staff was friendly, caring and always interacting w/the children. The 5 yr old camp had an air hockey table and TV. Supposedly they did activities but I rarely saw them out of the room. I would say it was an activity a day. 4. This needs its own line. My infant had his hand burnt in the Kids Camp. Paradisus is very concerned about the smell of the resort. In the evening there are lighted scented candles in metal containers as well as incense scattered throughout the resort. One location they decided to put it was hiding under a shelf in the kids camp. While I was helping my older children say good bye my infant was exploring on the ground. I had no idea that on the ground would be an open flame in a hot metal container as I couldn't see it b/c I was taller than the shelf. My son got hot wax all over the front surface of his right hand and burnt the tips of his fingers. The hotel did get a dr right away for me and did go to the pharmacy to get motrin and ointment for his burn, but needless to say I was pissed. Glad his burn was minor and only blistered a little. My husband told me that the girl had to get to towels to pick up the metal container and put it away. Things I wish they would improve 1. More Mexican Food 2. More Young Children's Activities and Toys in Kids Camp 3. Better consistent house cleaning 4. Earlier Dining Times for young families, maybe even a play area in some of the restaurants. Restaurants open at 6pm (that's 8pm EST). 5. Beach is dirty, choppy, and not worth spending beach time at. We walked the beach that was pretty much it. I know they can't change this, just something to keep in mind if you choose this location for vacation. You will spend your time at a pool if you go here. NO ONE was hanging out at the beach. It was windy, dirty, sharp rocks and honestly dangerous looking. Don't think you're going to spend time at the beach. You will not. All the reviews are telling the truth - it's not a good beach resort. Pool resort - yes, beach - NO. If we came on the vacation without our children, I think we would've had a blast and rarely run into any problems. But we booked this vacation w/our children in mind, told it was the best Melia resort for the children, and it clearly wasn't. I would rank it as a zero but that would be ignoring the fact that the pool is gorgeous and the food was better than normal.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely amazing!\u201d", "Author": "S B", "ReviewID": "UR126309332", "Content": "I will begin with two disclaimers: 1) I am an avid Tripadvisor reader and read reviews constantly but this the first I have ever wrtten. 2) I am a vacation club member with Melia, but again, having been to three resorts now as new members, thisis my first review. We just returned from six days at La Esmeralda and it was outstanding. We travelled with two children, aged seven and three. We have been to three resorts in the last year and this was he best (though the other two were also excellent). All week I told my husband what people complain about on tripadvisor and we just laughed. There really is nothing to complain about. The place is beautiful. The rooms are spacious, super clean, gorgeous. The food is plentiful and delicious. If you don't like something, the service is so outstanding they would bring you whatever you wanted. In fact, we met the Manager for Food and Beverage one night, as he just popped by our table at Fuego to see how our meal was and my husband just happened to mention one little suggestion for more Mexican food options; two days later on our way to dinner at Mole, we saw the same manager and he called the restaurant and specifically had them make my husband an enchilada that was not on the menu. When the kids wanted something different, the staff found it. The service is outstanding; anyone who complains really is being extremely picky. The kids club was superb! My son cried when we left and would ask us not to pick him up. The staff (Nadia, Natalia, Ariana, Elvis, Guy) were all sweet, caring, fun, attentive and adored the kids, and vice versa. Unlike a previous Paradisus kids club, this group of staff really engaged the kids and took them on adventures and kept them active and safe. The food was delicious. The best was Fuego but all are amazing have the dessert at Fuego (br\u00fbl\u00e9e and vanilla mousse). Our conceited, Griselda, was a sweetheart. She was so accommodating, genuinely interested in us and meeting our needs. Richards, Lolita and the other office staff were also great. Not many bar or poolside staff that stood out but everyone was super friendly. Can't say enough great things about this resort. I think for families, or young couples, having La Perla right next door and the option of hang the kids entertained and safe at the kids club is great.

This time it was the worst vacation ever, mainly because of the hotel. Firstly, you have to walk for about an hour to the center and with a taxi it is 10 USD, which is extremely expensive for every night. The hotel itself looks very boring, concrete buildings and it doesn\u00b4t feel like Mexico there. There is only one heated pool and it can be used for people who have family concierge rooms. The other pools are very cold. The beach is a walk away, very dirty, we found a gilette in the sand, imagine what could have happened if someone would have stepped on it? The rooms are new but the service is bad, the keys don\u00b4t work, a lot of people had problems in getting in to the rooms. We had this problem a lot of times during our stay. When we called the reception, we were told that we should wait because they are busy. So we waited for 45 minutes till someone came and let us in. The sevice is not 5-star, we have stayed in a lot of 5-star hotels all over the world and we haven\u00b4t seen this kind of service. Rooms are dirty because cleaning service comes when they want (read: they don\u00b4t clean nor come) and there were lot of times we had to contact reception, so they could send someone. The staff\u00b4s attitude is arrogant and they won\u00b4t even try or pretend to find solutions to the problems. The manager is the worst, I\u00b4ve never seen a manager like him. Someone commented this very correctly.. For every complaint he just says that it\u00b4s business and get over it. When they recieve the money for the hotel, they don\u00b4t care anymore how your stay is.

Had hoped most of the kinks were worked out, which they were but there is still some they are working on. Yes the reviews that state construction work is going on M-F are true, but its not anything you can't walk around. It didn't bother us. They had landscapers planting plants, painters, people pulling up and regrouting tile, and even guys in the ocean digging up all the \"sticks\" some people complained about (picture attached). So they are addressing the concerns from some of the negative reviews on here, they just need a little more time. The most frustrating part for us, was the \"info binder\" that all the other resorts we have been to that has all the info as to times, dress code, room service...etc wasn't in the room. We had to have them print out a kid club schedule and restaurants times. (our second room did have one though, so I think some just don't have it, or they haven't finished printing everything, I mentioned that it would have been helpful the first time at check out but they said they don't put them in all the rooms..go figure). Towel cards? No there was plenty. Purple for adult size, pink for kids, and green for baby. They had a hut by the kid pirate ship and another set up right as the bridge ended for the beach. Chairs/huts available? Yes, we never had a problem finding a spot at all, the chairs by the swim up bar where the kid blow up \"wipeout\" looking course filled up before 10am, but that was it. All of the chairs on the beach had some type of shade with/close to them. Reservations? Yes, for all but the buffet. Dress code was perfect, only had to dress up for 2 restaurants. The rest were \"casual\" which meant jeans were okay or khaki/dress shorts. This will be awesome in a month because most of them are not air conditioned and I hate trying to eat in July and having to wear slacks without a/c. Wristbands? Yes, color coded for age/family concierge/royal service. They are braided threads and not your typical resort/water park plastic band Kids club? Yes, it was open 9am-10pm and is for all kids (2 and up I believe). Also have an outdoor kid section that they open at 4pm with a bungee trampoline jump and rock wall. We even walked down to 5th ave to shop and left our cell # as we had saw others signed out to play golf etc.. usually they don't let you leave the resort. Our 7yr old loved the night parties they had, he went a few times during the day to try out the outdoor park, but wanted to swim with us the rest of the time. We don't use it as a daycare open to close service, but some do and their kids seemed to be entertained all day long everyday so the staff did great. Wifi/Ipod? Yes, sometimes we would have to reload a few times depending on our location but it worked around the pools and restaurants. There is also computers available for free use in the welcome lobby. The first room we were in didn't have an alarm clock, but the second one did have the ipod alarm clock station. both had the station for the tv to play your movies off the ipods. Housekeeping? We never had an issues, our room was often cleaned when we went to breakfast and turned down when we were at dinner. Not sure when the mini bar guy came, it was usually in the afternoon. Pools: were a bit chilly at first. The swim outs are kind of like a lazy river but not all of them connect to the main pool, but I wouldn't consider it a \"main\" pool, it was just a little more swimout room. The kids pool was a little bit warmer but not much. We didn't use the family pool, as I didn't feel the $50per adult and $25 per kid additional fee each day was worth warm water. Beach: plenty of chairs and clean sand. They were still digging out sticks etc.. but the part we swam in was cleaned. Only down side is there is NO bathroom by the beach, with a kid is is almost like a sprint to the closet one up by the restaurants and you need to sit right at the chairs by the bridge if you plan on making it there before they have an accident. Found it odd that one of the songs they played had the fuc* word clear as day over and over it in with kids sitting around, but I think this is just a personal opinion. Some didn't seem bothered, however I don't let my kids listen to music with that in it. The speakers were right by the family section also. Staff: pink ribbon belt was front desk/guest services, teal was time shares, and blue was the family concierge. Not sure what the guys were as they wore all white. Bar/servers had a teal solid colored shirts w/khaki shorts on the beach/pool area. Tips: We tipped but noticed most didn't, even a few $ can go a long way. We left money for the housekeeping, and money in the fridge for the mini bar. We usually gave $1 or $2 for drinks and depending on where we ate/how many people had to split the tip those varied. They were very appreciative of anything you offered, and since the resort was not super busy, I'm sure they don't make as much as other resorts right now just due to the low volume. We had a hard time breaking $20's, and the guy at the bar said they changed the rules out in town for the banks and US dollars, something about they can't get it as easy as they used to be able to. We took $100 worth of ones and $100 worth of 5's and ran out. But we did a few tours and had more taxi rides than usual. Overall it is very nice and 5star quality with the decor and food, but the staff was a hit or miss, and honestly very few seemed happy to be there. The morale was low, and I think less than 5 probably said \"hola\" to us in passing etc..while we were there, this was odd for us as we are used to so many saying Hola at other resorts. Not a big deal though. Had a few room issues but after being told to keep coming back to talk to someone else, I called the travel rep and then the office in the states and within an hour they had 7 rooms we could go to. We just wanted the room we paid for, the hotel should have been able to fix that without it going so high up. You couldn't tell it was spring break, I would guess maybe 1/2 of the resort was full--if that. In regards to the street/town the houses are like any that we have seen when traveling to Mexico, we didn't think it was in a bad area like some had posted.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cDiez Chicas, All Inclusive = Awesome Time\u201d", "Author": "EWLikesToTravel", "ReviewID": "UR126253626", "Content": "Let me start by giving a little background. I was one of 10 girls traveling from the Atlanta area, ranging in age from 37 to 57 \u2013 all married & all on the same tennis team. We are fortunate to reside in a nice area so our expectations for a resort and its amenities are high. We were at Paradisius La Esmeralda for 4 nights. We booked the trip in October through Cheap Caribbean. The photos looked good but we were really nervous because the hotel hadn\u2019t opened yet and there weren\u2019t any reviews available. However, the price was right so we decided to take a chance and we are glad we did. The trip wasn\u2019t without its challenges but the positives far outweighed the negatives so I would definitely recommend this property. CHECK IN: As others have communicated the check-in process was not as expected. We arrived at the resort around 1:30pm and were greeted with a fresh, cold towel that smelled divine. We were escorted to the check-in lounge while several bell captains (Rudy was AWESOME) took care of our bags. There was a bit of a wait to check-in (about 10-15 minutes) but that is to be expected especially since we were getting 5 rooms. The Chief Concierge, Zezinho, was there and he made sure we were all offered cold water and drinks while we were waiting. He also let us know if there was anything he could do to make our stay enjoyable to let him know \u2013 more on that later. When we made our reservation we made a special request to have all 5 rooms together and all with superior views. Unfortunately, the request was not granted. We were told the rooms weren\u2019t next door to each other but close and that some of the rooms had a good view while others had a premium view. We asked if there was anything they could do since we made the reservation months ago along with the special request. They did attempt to work it out but we were told they were at 90% capacity and there wasn\u2019t much they could do. We begrudgingly accepted this and asked for the keys so we could get settled. Guess what, the rooms weren\u2019t ready. By this time, it was almost 2:30pm. Advertised check in is at 3:00pm. Oddly enough, 5 rooms were not ready 30 minutes before check-in. We were asked to come back in 1 hour and 30 minutes, our rooms would be ready and we could obtain our keys. We decided to head to lunch (buffet at The Grill) and have a cerveza. We went back to the check-in lounge around 4:15pm (1 hour & 45 minutes later) to get the keys. Two rooms still weren\u2019t ready \u2013 one of them happened to be mine. Needless to say, I was NOT happy. We asked to speak with a manager and explained it was unacceptable, that check-in was at 3:00pm which indicates the room will be ready at 3:00pm not 5:30pm which is when we were told to check back for the second time. I suggested they get 4-5 housekeepers to go into each room and power clean it in 20 minutes. Possible - YES, would they accommodate us or take the suggestion \u2013 NO. After a long \u201cdiscussion\u201d we realized we weren\u2019t going to get anywhere and our only choice was to wait. We finally asked what they could do to make it better and the manager offered a 30 minute massage. Keep in mind we had to ask for it, nothing was offered until we asked. Knowing a 30 minute massage would really only be 20 minutes we asked him to offer a free 60 minute massage and surprisingly, he did. Those that had their rooms decided to get settled and we went with them to check out our room locations. As it turned out, both of the rooms that weren\u2019t ready were ready so there must be a big disconnect between housekeeping and the front desk. Unfortunately, upon arriving at all of our rooms we learned the check-in staff\u2019s definition of \u201cclose\u201d and \u201cgood view\u201d and our definition of the same were completely different. One room was on a different floor, none of the rooms were \u201cclose\u201d and 2 rooms had a view of the tennis courts and trampoline \u2013 not what I would call \u201cgood view\u201d. Six of us, in 3 of the 5 rooms headed back down to check-in. I know they could not have been happy to see our faces \u2013 AGAIN. The short version \u2013 we were told we would get new rooms the next day and to stop by at noon to see what was available. We went back at noon and the manager from the previous day was not there which turned out to be a plus. We were greeted by Elisa who knew all about our predicament and informed us we would have new rooms but she wasn\u2019t able to communicate which rooms yet. We were still a little perturbed that they couldn\u2019t tell us which rooms yet because surely they knew who had checked out and who hadn\u2019t but we let it go. We came back, as instructed, later in the afternoon and were finally granted new rooms on the same floor, in the same building, close to each other and with great views. Elisa was very accommodating and definitely went out of her way to put a smile on the faces of 6 disgruntled ladies. ACCOMODATIONS: this resort is first class and definitely warrants 5 stars when it comes to the design and d\u00e9cor. It is both chic and elegant \u2013 reminds me of a swanky South Beach boutique hotel. All of the photos online do it justice and the rooms are exactly as posted. POOL: Even though we stayed on the La Esmeralda side we relaxed by the La Perla pool each day. It was AWESOME. We met Aaron our first morning (Friday) and asked him to help us find a location \u2013 for 10 chicas that is not an easy task. He got us all set up in our own little area with lounge chairs, umbrellas, tables, towels, etc. He was awesome. We asked him to do the same the next day. He said he would but realized the next morning he wasn\u2019t scheduled. He took the initiative to call into Martin and asked him to get us all set up. How is that for going above and beyond? On our 2nd day (Saturday) we had Martin and Christina taking care of us. They were both wonderful and offered superior service. Christina was always available to get our drinks, snacks, lunch (the mozzarella caprese focaccia is DELICIOUS), etc. We never had to wait for her \u2013 it was as if she magically appeared. On our last day poolside Gabriel was the one to hook us up with a location. Not sure who told him but whoever was on staff for a particular day seemed to expect us and had a perfect spot awaiting our arrival. It was so nice not to worry about getting up at the crack of dawn to \u201creserve\u201d chairs. We were definitely well taken care of. Note: The palapas (covered huts) are hard to come by & they were taken early (earlier than the pool staff arrived) so if you want one of these you do have to go at the crack of dawn. We went at 4:30am before we went to bed!!! The swim up bar was a lot of fun as well and Dr. Phil makes the best dirty monkey in Mexico. 8 of our group took water aerobics with Pablo and had a blast. Another day it was Ivan and Israel (his name tag says something else that I can\u2019t remember). On Friday afternoon they had an awesome pool party with a DJ, entertainers and several of the hotel staff dancing poolside while others walked around with shots \u2013 it was a blast. These guys - Pablo, Ivan and Israel \u2013 were great and fun to hang around with. We ran into them at one of the clubs and they made the evening a memorable one. ZEZHINO \u2013 yes, he actually gets his own category. Zezhino Silva is the Chief Concierge for La Esmeralda. I can\u2019t say enough wonderful things about \u201cZ\u201d as our group lovingly named him. He was there from the moment we entered the reception area. He did everything he could to make our stay enjoyable both on and off the resort. He was our personal coordinator (not really but he made us feel like royalty). We heard Coco Bongo was a place to be seen. \u201cZ\u201d got us in VIP without paying VIP prices \u2013 no wait in line, 2 front row tables, transportation and more. Not only that he met us upon arrival, walked us in, got us settled and then partied all night with us. We didn\u2019t expect that at all. He checked in with us during the day to make sure we were happy and even stopped by briefly to visit us at the pool. Saturday night he did the same at Mandala \u2013 VIP, table, transport, etc. and the third night we met him at The Blue Parrot. He has an incredibly warm spirit and in just three days he went from being someone who works at La Esmeralda to a wonderful friend. ROOM SERVICE: On our first night we all got together in one of the rooms and ordered room service \u2013 not by choice (see below). It was a big order. We figured it would take a long time and it did. The food was good, the room service delivery staff was great and the presentation as expected. We ordered snacks on another night and it was the same. The only complaint I would have is the dishes were not picked up in a timely manner and there were a lot of dishes in the hallways where guests had left their dishes to be picked up. We added our dishes to one of the piles and they were still there the next morning. DINNER RESERVATIONS: The process needs improvement. I knew from other Trip Advisor posters that reservations must be made upon arrival. We tried to make them while we were checking in at 1:30pm and were told we had to call from our room \u2013 LOL \u2013 what room \u2013 we didn\u2019t have a room. When we finally got to a room to make the call for dinner reservations that evening it was after 5:00pm. Surprise, reservations can\u2019t be made after 5:00pm. How does this make sense? I have to make a reservation directly from my room, my room is not available until after 5:00pm, reservations desk closes at 5:00pm??? Hence, the room service. Knowing how perturbed I was the woman on the phone did help me with reservations for the rest of the stay. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t get anything for the following evening (Friday) except 6:00pm or 9:45pm and the only available two nights later (Saturday) was at 8:45pm \u2013 a little late for our tastes but we had no choice. This was a cluster\u2026.. RESTAURANTS: The Grill (lunch the first day-Thursday) \u2013 the staff was incredible, the food was great. It was a buffet but since we were a large group they decided to provide us a family style luncheon and brought huge platters of everything to the table. They also kept the drinks flowing which really helped us to relax after the awful check-in experience. The food was on par with a buffet. The drinks \u2013 YUMMY \uf04a The Grill (dinner Friday) \u2013 we didn\u2019t want to go back to the same place but this was the only thing available and we were hungry. It was a sit down, menu atmosphere of Italian/Argentinian flavor. There were several choices on the menu and they all sounded good. Unfortunately, some of the food, when delivered, was undercooked. We didn\u2019t have time to send it back because we needed to get back to our rooms to get ready for a night on the town so most of us didn\u2019t eat much \u2013 PRIORITIES!!! Bana (dinner Saturday) \u2013 this is the Japanese/Hibachi restaurant. We had reservations at 8:45 and since there were 10 of us they put us in our own room with our own table. We arrived at 8:55 \u2013 fashionably late \u2013 our table was ready. We were seated and waited and waited and waited. I had to go to the hostess to ask for a waiter to take a drink order. We waited and waited \u2013 still nobody came. We had to ask the hostess again. Finally, after 20+ minutes of waiting they came. We didn\u2019t get a menu to choose our meal. We were told you will have a little of everything and we did. The food was good, very salty \u2013 like most hibachi style restaurants but plentiful. The atmosphere was cool and I would recommend a visit during your stay. Fuego (dinner Sunday) \u2013 we had reservation at 8:00pm and were led to a private room in the back. The air control wasn\u2019t working so it was a little stuffy but the privacy allowed us to be loud without bothering other diners. The service was excellent and very attentive. Once again, we didn\u2019t have menus \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if this was commonplace at the resort or if it had to with the size of our group. This restaurant is like a tapas style eatery \u2013 at least for our group it was. The staff just kept bringing dishes starting with several different pre-appetizers, then appetizers, entrees and dessert. One of the ladies renamed this restaurant Nibbles due to the bite sized portions. The food was excellent and the desserts were DIVINE. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Hadar \u2013 (breakfast buffet) \u2013 we had breakfast here each morning. It is set up as a buffet with muffins, breads, bagels, cereals, meats, cheeses, made to order omelets, fruit, etc. It is very good and perfect way to start each day. Naos \u2013 (lunch buffet) \u2013 we had lunch here one day and it too offered a wide variety of food \u2013 similar to a cruise ship buffet. TIPPING: Absolutely, the staff works very hard to make your vacation a memorable experience. Good service deserves to be rewarded. Everyone was very appreciative and went out of their way to say thank you. CLUBS: #1 \u2013 Coco Bongo: I have been to a lot of the most popular clubs in the best cities and this one is definitely at the top of the list. A completely different experience and definitely worth the money. #2 \u2013 Mandala: An open air atmosphere that can\u2019t be beat. #3 \u2013 The Blue Parrot: Not that impressed by this establishment, open air but definitely not as chic or upscale as Mandala \u2013 it is on the beach but I don\u2019t want to dance with sand in my toes. Seems like more of a flip flop place \u2013 not my thing for evening entertainment. OVERALL: An awesome experience and we plan to go back next year for round 2. Would definitely recommend the hotel with the understanding that it is new, they are understaffed and they have some kinks to work out.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood service.

We enjoyed the buffet at Naos very much and had most of our dinners there. The croissants (esp the chocolate ones) were as good as any we have had in Paris or NY. The Market, which was an Argentinean steakhouse, was good. Vento, which is Mediterranean, was great - it was more Middle Eastern than Italian and we enjoyed the change. One night at the Naos buffet seemed to focus on Middle Eastern food and had superb stuffed cabbage. There has been much written on this board about the beach. We enjoyed the beach and its natural feel. The area on the left, with its small natural lagoon, was also very interesting and attracted a lot of local families. This had less of a touristy feel and we liked that a lot. The Mangrove area was kept in place due to Mexican law and we came to enjoy the ecologic sense of the area. The hotel was cleaning up much of the wood that is in the sand under the water when we were there. We walked to Playa del Carmen along the beach and it took about 35 minutes to get to the pier.

When we walked into the open lobby with the zen pool garden beyond it was like being in paradise. I have never seen so many lounging areas in a resort in my life! There were large sofa areas with big pillows, cabana beds, large chairs everywhere in this sprawling complex. La Esmeralda is the family side of this complex with shared facilities dividing this from La Perla, the adults only side of the resort. The common area consists of the many wonderful restaurants and lounges the resort has - some for families and some adults only. It is a nice set-up altogether. The family pool area has a large pirate ship on one end with slides and on the other end a giant blow up raft on the end near the swim up bar - what a great idea - mom and dad can supervise their kids in the pool while sitting in the water at the bar just a few feet away. The adults only pool also has a swim up bar - no toys - but some water aerobics at certain times of the day. The beach is just a short walk over a boardwalk surrounded by natural foliage. Unfortunately you can not see the beach or the ocean from the resort, but there are lots of loung chairs and cabanas down at the beach too. During our stay it was too windy for the beach so we stayed around the pool and received great service all day. The food at this place is incredible (and I am a food snob). I have never had such great food at a resort. While we did not take advantage of special services in the spa we did use the steam room, sauna and spa pools. Again the spa area had three day bed cabanas that you could hang out in. All-in-all this was a very nice place for total relaxation. The nuevo-tech music that played most of the time got to me - I think they had the same girl singing every song. I would have liked to hear some carribean, latin or regge music to liven up the pool area. This also being a very new resort could use some polishing on the training of its employees (many of whom did not speak english) for a bit more attention to small details. All of the staff, though was friendly and helpful. I am not sure I would come back here (or anyplace I had to fly into Cancun as that was a total cluster f.... - they need some serious help at that airport) as it is very expensive and there is no place else to go as you are in the barrios away from the downtown area. We were told that you could walk the beach to town (about a half hour walk), but otherwise, the only way to get anyplace is by cab, which is very expensive.

The grounds are beautiful, a perfect combination of decor and landscaping. We did come in via the local neighborhood. Note that the drive off the main road to the hotel took approximately 3 minutes. Note that we saw families walking with their children along the streets. Was it dangerous? NO. To me, the neighborhood was just a classic local area. Of course, there were no million dollar mansions. Give me a break! The people that reside in this area live a simple life. It is reflective in their housing. Don't judge. You are lucky to be able to afford La Esmeralda. Not everyone is that fortunate. And you should never judge a book by its cover. The people in Playa are gentle people. The new road to arrive at the resort is scheduled to open shortly or is already open. Check in was fine. They have a bar area in the Check In Lobby for you to enjoy drinks if your room is not ready. I believe there were also TV's there as well. The hotel rooms are gorgeous. I looked at 3 different types of rooms and they all were impressive. We chose to stay in a swim up. We loved it. We spent 1/2 day at the beach and then 1/2 day back in our swim up pool area. Total luxury. I would take my book and read in the pool and/or swim in our pool area. LOVED the Shower in the room......I don't know the exact word for it, but the water jets down from the ceiling. Huge Bathtubs. If you get a certain type of suite, you will also have a Jacuzzi tub on your patio or balcony. If you have an IPOD, bring it. Every room has a fantastic dockers with great sound. We loved listening to our favorite music in the evenings getting ready for dinner. The Swim Up Bar at La Esmeralda is fun. The main pool is great. The only negative I found was this trampoline thing that was in that area and it attracted too many children. I hope it has since been removed because they have another fabulous pool with a pirate ship and water slide for the children next to it. I personally loved the Mangroves that separate the hotel from the beach area. It gave you a tropical jungle type vibe and when you are on the beach, you felt a wonderful disconnect from the hotel itself. The Beach is a natural beautiful beach. Yes, some area's of sand are wider than others in area's, but that is what you would expect from something made from Mother Nature. You can walk forever, both ways. We never saw any vendors peddling things to buy or bothering you. The water is warm, clear, and such amazing different colors of Aqua. Absolutely Mesmerizing. I enjoyed taking a cold drink out and just standing up to my waist in the water sipping my drink and just basking in the sunshine and enjoying the soothing Caribbean Sea. The Service on the beach we found great. Our server was super friendly and we had no problems getting ice cold drinks served to us. After a day or so, he would look in the water if we were not in our beach chairs and signal \"Do you want a drink?\"....... Restaurants - They were all Excellent. Each restaurant is different with it's type of cuisine. We ate at Vento, The Argentinean Steak House, The Brazilian Restaurant, and the Teppanyaki. I was particularly impressed with the Salad Bars, filled with such a fresh variety of different items. Then the actual meals themselves were always perfectly cooked to order. The waiter always asked if it was okay and was everything good. I am positive if we had said no, he would have done something about it. Service very personable and friendly. Did they rush us? No. We enjoyed leisurely dinners with wine. Was it too slow? Not in my opinion. To me the timing of the meal was just right. They even encouraged us to sit and relax and drink some more wine after our dinner was finished. The Bars in the hotel really modern and each decorated differently. They are just plain fun to sit and enjoy a drink. The architecture was really innovative. Top Shelf Alcohol. Bartenders are well trained and can make amazing concoctions. Each bar had a totally different vibe and ambience, thus you really can choose what suits your mood and/or style. There are also a couple of late night dance clubs on property. While we did not go, they appeared to be really popular and stayed open I believe until 2 am. The Breakfast Buffet had an great selection of items for everyone. This included the \"Mimosa and Bloody Mary \"Do it Yourself\" bar set up there as well. If you have children (which we do not), I recommend splurging for the Family Concierge. It's a true children's paradise. Cotton Candy, Sno Cone, Caramel Corn Machines and so much more around the Family Concierge Pool Area. And that pool does have a swim up bar for the parents! I also want to emphasize that I never encountered any rude staff. But maybe that is because I am always friendly to everyone and say \"please\" and \"thank you\" to all the staff at any resort I visit. I have stayed in All-Inclusive's in Cancun (2), Playa Del Carmen (2), Punta Cana (3), Bahamas (1), Jamaica (2), all different hotels. I have also stayed at plenty of also Non All Inclusive Resorts throughout the world. And there is no such thing as a \"perfect\" hotel. The Paradisus Playa Del Carmen sits at the top of my list of All-Inclusive Resorts. I am not a travel agent, nor am I related or employed by Paradisus. I am just a very satisfied customer. I actually also do not normally write reviews. I do read them all the time. So this time, I decided it was time for me to write one and \"give back\" to Trip Advisor. To me, La Esmeralda is a 5 star resort and absolutely fantastic. The Management at this hotel know what they are doing. They run and manage an amazing property with professionalism which is reflected everywhere in the resort. We will definitely be going back.

We booked our trip with cheap Caribbean back in October 2011. Once we arrived in cancun & waited forever our shuttle to the resort (not the resorts fault) the transportation company did not have all our names. I say we waited about an hour. The drive to the resort wasn't bad at all. Apparently they are still working on the front entrance so we entered I guess through the back. No big deal. Once we pulled up we were greeted by a woman welcoming us with a nice cold towel. Our luggage was then taken. We went to the front desk & it's about 2:00 ish & our rooms aren't ready yet so no big deal we are hungry. We then go to a restaurant for lunch & was there for a good 2 hours. We figured at this point our rooms would be ready since check in is at 3:00 but only 3 of our rooms were ready. Check in was very slow & painful. Our rooms were supposed to be all near one another which was not the case & we were told we would get upgrades. A couple of the rooms faced the tennis courts & the bungy jump for kids. Apparently they could not move the 3 rooms that were not happy until the next night. Housekeeping was still cleaning rooms after 5:00. You can clearly tell this resort is majorly understaffed in all areas! We did move the next night & got a pool view. Alysa the front desk manager wonderful. Your chief concierge Zenzino Silva is absolutely the best. He went above & beyond for our group & made sure we were taken care of. You have yourself one great manager there. Once we got settled into our rooms it was after 5:00 & we tried to make dinner reservations & we were told we were past the time. Go figure! They suggested the restaurant where we ate for lunch which we didn't want to go back to. We ended up ordering room service. That night on our way to club gabi for those that didnt order room service we had tapas. We passed a couple of restaurants on the way there & so a lot of empty tables & wondered why they couldn't accommodate our group other than the fact short on staff. The entertainment staff did a great job especially Ivan. Boy do they work a lot of hours! Aaron & martin at the pool were awesome. They helped us everyday getting our chairs all together & the palapsos ( high demand) We ate in Bana one night hibachi service was terrible. We waited at least a half hour before someone entered our room & took our drink order. Once he showed up we told him we had to be somewhere in a certain amount of time & he quickly started cooking the food which was very salty. Our last night we ate at Fuegos which was probably our best dinner. Service was slow there too but the waiters went out of the way to accommodate us. We were in the back room. As far as the morning breakfast buffet you will not starve my only complaint it's the same thing every day. I do recommend going to coco bongo & Mandela which are off property & not included but you will have a great time. The resort will help assist with getting you there. I do have to say the resort is decorated very nice. They just need to work out a few kinks & hire more staff. They also need to tone down the smell in the front desk area. It smells good but is very strong. Then beach is nothing spectacular. I stayed mostly at the pool on the adult side. The lunch by the pool was good too. I can't say enough good things about Zenzino Silva. If you need anything see him. I will be back as long as Zenzino & Ivan are there.

This was by far the best and most expensive trip that we have ever been on. Upon arriving, I thought that I was walking around in a dream. The grounds are really unbelievable. We even loved how the hotel preserved the natural man groves. everything really impressed me here. The newly constructed rooms are amazing. The staff and service was first class. We booked a family concierge suite and Enrique our concierge bent over backwards to make our stay enjoyable. He put cookies and milk in the rooms every night, he blew up balloons for a fun surprise one night, and created an anniversary surprise in our room. The concierge pool was amazing. Estella ran around to make my kids happy. The bar tenders made exotic special drinks just for the kids. They made cotton candy, popcorn and hot dogs by the pool. My kids stayed in the pool all day long because the temperature was just perfect. some nights we even came for an evening swim and temperature was just right. All of the other pools are not heated, so don't waste your money on a swim out. The kids pool was amazing, slides and water play area, but kids didn't like the cold pool, so we spent all day at the concierge pool being pampered. The kids club, indium ply stunning. The ladies who run it are amazing. I am always very nervous leaving my kids as they are still so young. My worries were all for naught. Natalia, Ytalia and Monica were first class caregivers. they also bent over backwards to make sure the kids were happy. The facilities at the kids club are second to none. In our vast travels, we have ever seen anything like it. The facilities are just awesome. they even deliver snacks, lunch and dinner to the kids club if you want some private dining time with your significant other. I loved that this club was open until 10 pm every night. entertainment was not the best, but make sure not to miss the fire show on Friday nights. I was a little disappointed that the concierge suites had 2 double side by side beds. although the beds were exceptionally comfortable, it was not the best arrangement as everyone had to go to bed and wake up at the same time. we were used to our kig bed at home and felt squashed sleeping in a double, so we upgraded to the one bedroom suite wich was very impressive, and had a separate sleeping area for the kids. the kids had their own tv and so did we and everyone was happy. The food. was great. Probably of the highest quality that I have seen to date. Nobody got sick from the food , we all ate raw sushi without a problem. The food handling procedures were obviously impecable. being a real foodie, I can say that you won't find expensive cuts of steak, or giant shrimp the size of your fist, like Houston's , but that is not what you get with an AI resort. The French restaurant was to die for. we got a free dinner there, and would have gladly paid 80 dollars for a second experience. the tasting menue was out of this world along with the ambiance and service. I loved the open air dining areas that were offered in his resort. 2 things that were my favorites here were the latte's (way better than Starbucks) and the giant king sized palapa beds scattered around the resort. I am not a sun lover, and really appreciated the comfort of the giant beds.

HOTEL - The hotel is nice and clean. Food is decent not great and not bad. The best is Bana the Benihana type restaurant. Reservations for the restaurants you can make immeditately when you arrive with your personal concierge. We reservations twice later in the week but because there were two of us we walked into one resturant right away (brazilian steak) and another, Mole (mexican restaurant) we waited about an hour so you might not always need to make a reservation. IMPORTANT - Don't be afraid to order two entrees per person if you can't decide on what to get. I ate every morning in the breakfast buffet and order made to order omelettes, which were great. It can be loud in the morning as the hallways echo and if you have a room on the poolside with the kids up early playing. We NEVER had a problem with our room being made but we did leave 20 pescos each time. You do need to wear shorts or keep a small bag with pool wear with you when you check in because your room WILL NOT ready until at least 3 pm and you give the bellmen you luggage immediately upon arrival. As Adults you do have access to both hotels. Kids are allowed up to a certain point but I think were allowed in all restaurants regardless of which side but I am not sure. BEACH - The beach is narrow with seaweed and does have a smell (not overwhemling but noticable) but this was the case from this resort all the way to Playa Del Carmen as my wife and walked the beach to there twice (approx 35-40 min). The beach did open up quite a bit in spots in Playa Del Carmen but it was crowded. As for the smell I had heard from divers before arriving that the area had bad storms over the past year and churned the ocean making it not as good for diving and wonder if this was the reason for the beaches and smell. It was completely safe to walk along the beach. TIP grab some beverages for the walk from the beer and water cooler by the beach bar and bring a bag to stock up for the walk. You can drink with no problem along the entire beach. LOCATION - The hotel is in what appears to be the poorest part of town but we took a couple of times from Playa Del Carmen to the resort and it did not seem unsafe but I would pay attention. The resort is completely safe and nice. The cab ride was $10 USD from 5th avenue to the hotel may be a little more if you pick it up from the south end of the town and again a 35-40 min walk along the beach which was completely safe. SPA - People should remember to use the spa for sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, and relaxing pool. There wasn't any additional cost but no one was using it because I think they associated it with additional cost. The Spa is on the La Perla side. BEVERAGES - Beverages are top shelf, Grey Goose, Absolute, Johnny Walker Red and Black, Bacardi, Cabo Wabo tequila, etc. Beer is Sol not Corona (I love Corona), Dos XX,.Tecate, and Tecate Light. They DO NOT water down the drinks and you can get them strong or lighter if you like. APPLEVACATIONS - If you use applevcations, try your best to flag down your the representative. We never saw him the entire week and there were notes in his binder to contact people. OVERALL - The hotel is nice, clean, people were extremely friendly, service was fast at times and other times slow (but your on vacation), food was decent and was made anyway you requested it, if you didn't go to the buffet. Drinks were great except for no corona and it is close to Playa Del Carmen. The beach and smell were basically the same from the hotel all the way to and including in Playa Del Carmen. My wife and I travel quite a bit and are from Chicago so we know food, beverages, service, bad neighborhoods, and beaches.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sherbrooke, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat vacation!\u201d", "Author": "aroy17", "ReviewID": "UR125605402", "Content": "We went to this hotel from Feb. 25th 2012 to Mar. 3rd 2012 with our 2 year old daughter. The hotel is amazingly decorated. It shows that it's new. In the lobby there are fountains with fishes, and it is hugh! The are many buildings for the rooms, all very clean. The trip to the room is long, so bring a stroller if you have kids! We forgot our stroller at home and the concierge at the hotel got us a little car, that saved us! Our room was with a separate bedroom. Great! There was a semi-kitchen and a living room. On the big balcony, we had a bath where our daughter liked to play before dinner. The bathroom was great too. It was all very clean. No problem at all with that. One day we left the \"do not disturb\" sign on the door and to our surprise they came at 8PM to clean the room! The pools are great. For the kids they have a special pool with waterslides and a pirate boat. In that pool the water depth is only about 4 feet. There is a small round pool as well that's only 1 foot deep, that amused our daughter for many hours.... There is also another pool that goes all around the buildings, this pool is EXTREMELY cold!!!! I don't know if they put ice in it at night, but grrrrrrrrr be prepared. That's the pool connecting all the \"swin in\" rooms. The chairs along the pools are very comfy, and they also have little huts for families which are great. The food is excellent. Nothing to say about that except that it is much better than everywhere else we've been before. The buffet is not big, and of quality. It is chic. The music is loud however.... Good service as well. I had smoked salmon every morning. For lunch you have 3 choices : buffet, the market, or the pool bar. The market is excellent, with a salad bar (and I did not get sick with the salad!). The pool restaurant is ok (hot dogs, club sandwich, etc.). I wouldn't say I ate well there, though. There's a bar by the pool, and that includes sparkling wine:) At night there are MANY choices. Bresilian, japanese, mediteranean, buffet. If you don't have kids, you're also allowed to go the the \"la perla\" restaurants (same hotel, for adults, 1 minute away). Bring elegant clothes, we did not bring any and regretted it! The staff is extremely nice. All smiling and willing to help (even though sometimes there's a language barrier what leads to misunderstandings....). The only problem with the hotel, and that's why I rank it 4 instead of 5, is the beach. First, you have to walk a long time to get to the beach. That's because it's a brand new hotel, and there's a law now that says that you have to leave the trees where there are. Once you do get to the beach, you have to walk a longggggg time before you reach the chairs and umbrellas. There was A LOT of sea algua ON the beach and IN the water. There were also big rocks in the water, so I did not swim at all there (it hurts to hit one, especially since the water is not clear). I must admit that with my 2 year-old daughter, we spent our time on the beach rather than in the water and it did the job. Our sand castles were enough to entertain her. Overall, the hotel is a five-star hotel, if you are not looking to spend time on the beach. I would definitely go back there in the future, and I totally recommand it.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Park Ridge, New Jersey, United States", "Title": "\u201cJust back, great resort, great food !\u201d", "Author": "Chris H", "ReviewID": "UR125525149", "Content": "My familiy and I just returned from an 8 day vacation, stayed at Paradisus La Esmeralda. I was very impressed with the hotel. If you are looking for a quiet not too crowded place then this is it. My kids both 7 and 10 enjoyed playing in the pool, they have a large pirate ship with slides as well as a blow up obstacle course in the pool. The hotel was VERY clean a bit modern but you dont lose the island feel. I liked the tranquil music they played throughout the resort - very relaxing. One of the best massages I have had the spa was incredible. Most impressive was the food, Ive stayed at many all inclusives and the food is to be expected, ok at best. This was above all of them. The only downside I would say is the beach, its not as wide, the water is a bit rough and there is ocean weeds that washup on shore (not a reason not to go to resort) but Ive seen better beaches. Hands down the pool areas are incredible with plenty of poolside bed huts to grab w/ your family and relax. You want to be on the ground floor with a walk out pool - just beautiful for night swims rightout side your room. They do offer to meet the \"VIP's\" for breakfast and they will offer you a $150 credit towards spa or gift shop - dont go.

For starters, there were a few hiccups with check-in. The front desk staff are, by far, the worst detail about this hotel and incompetent/inconsistent at their job. Prior to arriving, we emailed the hotel to confirm that we have interconnecting rooms (for child purposes), and when we arrived, they said that they had none available (despite the hotel confirming this detail only 24 hours prior to arriving). Luckily, we had printed their email so that when we arrived, we demanded that they honour their reservation and we were upgraded to an amazing swim-up poolside suite with interconnecting rooms! I can see why so many people are frustrated with the check-in process and often saw extremely lengthy check in lines & rooms not being ready. We also experienced similar discrepancies with the front desk when we requested a late checkout to accommodate to our 8pm flight and travelling with a 1 year old child, and after talking to 3 different people, got different stories and discovered that rooms are only assigned 24 hours prior to check-in.... so when we were granted late checkout the day prior to leaving, it was then reversed the morning of departure and we were told we must leave earlier than anticipated. We were forced to loiter in the lobby for 5 hours to seek refuge from the sun with our baby. However, the entire resort was absolutely beautiful, fresh, modern, and well laid out. Our room was gorgeous (after a courtesy $700 upgrade), but we had electrical problems for the first 24 hours and we were often left with no power... this was a minor nuisance but was fixed after 3 attempts to correct it. I am pleased that an electrician was present within minutes of reporting it to the front desk. The beach was beautiful and well manicured, and pool/beachside lounging chairs were always abundant (despite a few jerks who lay their belongings on numerous covered cabanas and then disappear for hours). Now for the service.... WOW! 2 thumbs up for prompt and friendly service in all areas of the hotel. A special thanks to Daniel, a pool side server from the Sunrise Grill, who always ensured we had cold drinks in our hands and always greeted us with a smile. A little tip goes a long way to these hard working hotel staff! The food was fantastic with a vast array of dishes available at the all the restaurants and was timely with excellent service to adult and child requests. The one note worthy exception to the restaurant menus was Passions, which is adult only and not included in luxclusive package, service was well choreographed with 2 servers tending to the table together, however the meal size was unacceptable, we are talking 3 quarter sized pieces of meat....literally.With the amazing service and menus at all the included areas your time is better spent else where. If I have any tips for anyone who requires a specific type of room, please EMAIL THE HOTEL PRIOR TO ARRIVAL AND BRING A COPY WITH YOU! Also, be mindful of details that are beyond hotel control... yes, there are a few mosquitoes despite them spraying pesticides.... yes its a 45 minute bus ride into the Mayan Riviera... yes you need to make dinner reservations before 5pm, but these are completely typical details for all hotels in Mexico. Also, DON'T fall for the time-share scammers in the white pantsuit who are excellent at wasting your time.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumming, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cSo far, Not so good\u201d", "Author": "travel_mama_of_5", "ReviewID": "UR125103480", "Content": "We arrived and our rooms were not ready.

We are a family of 4 and stayed for a week in the Family Concierge section. The hotel is finished with many of the earlier kinks I was worried about worked out; the new road leading to the hotel was being worked on the day of our arrival. We were detoured through town and were able to see the locals going about their day (good for kids to see that Mexico isn't just resorts--there are schools, local shops, etc). We were welcomed with a cool towel and a drink of our choice--kids were already hooked! The whole resort felt (and smelled!) like a spa. The hotel is well laid out and compact (no shuttles needed here) with many areas to relax and enjoy your vacation. The rooms are the nicest I've seen in a hotel--plenty of space which makes the room feel less cluttered. There was a nice balcony with a jacuzzi tub, spacious bathroom with a rainfall shower and oversized tub (though no proper soap dish and an extra towel needed on the floor while taking a long shower). Beds are the most comfortable I've ever had in Mexico. The mini-bar was well stocked and included a few bottles of spirits to mix (I prefer to leave that to the bartenders), as well as a Nespresso maker that was great for an espresso on the balcony before breakfast. The cable didn\u2019t offer cartoons in English, though we figured how to play movies through our iPod through the docking station--there is also a DVD player. There were a few pools to select from: the pirate ship and obstacle course (a.k.a. the wipeout zone) were popular with the kids. There is also a kiddie pool, the lagoon pools and a quiet pool behind the rooms as you head to the beach. The \u201cwarm\u201d pool is for the Family Concierge guests, though the other pools temps were fine and refreshing during the hot days. The numerous bali beds offered a nice break from the sun; there were board games to check out, too. The music at the pool was generally serene, though there was some pop music played at times during activities. There was also a great live band one day while we were there. There are a variety of activities throughout the day for the kids: races, water balloon fights, dance lessons, pottery painting, etc. There is also bungee jumping/trampoline and climbing wall at 4:00 every day. The staff working with the kids were very enthusiastic and friendly. The beach was a short walk from the hotel with towels and a bar at the beach entrance (no towel cards needed here). There are rocks and seaweed in the area when you first come to the beach, but the swimming area just to the left (can\u2019t miss it). Warm, beautiful water. We loved how undeveloped the beach area was--made for great exploring north of the property. We really enjoyed the food. The breakfast buffet had much for everyone (chocolate croissants that I\u2019ll be dreaming about for a while), including a mimosa and bloody mary station, and an omelette station. There is a buffet for lunch, but there are other good choices: sunset grill poolside where they cook to order, and the Market that offers a salad bar with made to order meats, pastas and pizzas (we loved the fried grouper when they had it and the pasta bolognese). Dinner buffet was ok, but all of the other restaurants were superb: the Market (Brazilian, meat-lovers celebrate), Bana (lots of food--appetizers, fried rice, stir fry and dessert), Mole (unique and yummy Mexican food) and Vento (Mediterranean). The drinks were also great--all top shelf liquor. We had a great experience and hope to return here again. The kids really loved this place too. If you are staying in the Family Concierge section, no need to pack sunscreen, mosquito repellant, kids shampoo, kids toothbrushes and paste--all supplied (brand name, too). Our concierge, Manolo, was kind and thoughtful and had a few great tricks up his sleeve!

Had read that it was 45 min but there were 5 or 6 other resorts to stop at first so we were on the bus for well over 2 hours. Same for the return. The resort was very nice but driving in to there on the bus was very sad to see how some of the people lived. Upon check in we didn\u2019t get room as requested but were told we could up grade for about $700 more (that was with the $400 coupon) - NOT. So on that note we took a ground floor room with swim up patio which was nice but ended up right in front of the kids section so unless you brought kids with you it was a little annoying sometimes with all the noise. Yes, some of us out here would like to vacation without listening to other people's children screaming day and night. However, it was nice that only adults were allowed in some restaurants. The room itself was very nice, big bathroom with walk in shower, private toilet & also a big tub. The restaurants... Great!! It was so nice to have so many choices and be able to revisit the same one over again just as long as you made your reservations in advance - but ADVANCE is the key. We missed out on the cooking show one because we didn't reserve in time. There was always a big buffet available for breakfast, lunch & dinner if you wanted as well. Have to say there was a great selection of drinks available as well. The service was always great. They didn\u2019t really make their guests aware of entertainment that was going on so if you happen to come across something \u2013 good for you. The info just wasn\u2019t there or at least we didn't know about it. We didn't find that there was much to do. On the day we were leaving, we were taking a last walk around and came across a different section we hadn\u2019t seen that had this big beautiful heated pool we didn\u2019t know about. The other pools were really quite cold, especially the one from our room. So we missed that one. We were advised to only take a taxi into Playa del Carmen to 5th Ave for shopping to be safe which we did. That was fine, enjoyed that. It cost about $8-$10 each way for the taxi to 5th Ave. The beach was a little disappointing. It was nice but quite narrow and you really had to watch where you walked all the time.. Some areas of the water were really dirty & not very inviting but we found one spot that you could wade out & wasn\u2019t bad to walk on. Since the place is so new I assume that is why there isn't much for flowers around. The layout and design is very new and elegant and the furniture is really nice. They had nice furniture on the beach if you walked down far enough but... It sure was a very long walk back if you needed to go to the washroom. There were no washrooms any where near the beach. Had to go all the way back into the hotel for washrooms. So, over all I think the resort was very nice but still has room for improvement on a few things. It was a good choice and really enjoyed seeing a place that was so fresh and new. The staff was very friendly as well as the servers and bartenders. I would definitely recommend this place to others.

Manolo was excellent and many thanks to him for looking out for us as well as the familes assigned to him. The restaurants are excellent and all the alcohol is high quality. The children enjoyed the pool with the inflatable obstacle course. There were lots of little irritations eg our TV did not have kids channels in English even though the guide in the room said it did.

We had been to Atlantis in Nassau 2 times prior and had a fantastic time. There were 2 separate groups with 20+ people in each group. We spent over $100K for the flight tickets and accomidations so we expected nothing short of spectacular. I was booked on the second group travelling with my wife and 2 kids from Feb 5th to the 12th. The first group absolutely loved the resort so I had nothing but very high expectations for this resort. The transfer bus from the Cancun Airport to the resort took about an hour to get there. We unfortunately encountered a flight delay so the bus did not get to the resort till around 2:30 am. The streets were dark and I could not really make out where we were going. Neither did the bus driver. Even the resort itself did not have ample lighting so the bus had to painfully maneuver around tight corners to get to the lobby entrance. Upon arrival, the Family Concierge desk staff were friendly and welcomed us with big smiles. We headed to our room and behold, the card keys did not work. A room attendant was dispatched and we were let into our room. Before I even had a chance to admire the accomodations, I noticed a very big flaw....there was only 1 bed. This had to be a mistake. I booked 2 beds, and paid extra for the Family Concierge. Considering it was 3 am, I was beat and fairly upset. I headed down to the front desk and was told that the double beds were only offered upon availability. What???? Everyone else was in the same boat. 4 other families. I expressed my disappointment and they said a roll a bed set to our rooms. I was not in the mood to argue being so tired. When we awoke, we then began to admire the room. It was nicely decored with contemparay fixtures. It featured a large tub, a spacious fully tiled shower, private toilet and a jacuzzi on the patio. Wireless internet is free and an ethernet jack set up by the corner table. One thing that was annoying was the fact they only had 1 tiny garbage can set up by the toilet. Really? With a family? There was no specific time the room was attended to. On many days, the room was still unclean at 3 pm. Not enough staff maybe? I would suggest a \"Please Clean Room\" card that can be inserted in the key card slot like in cruise ships. Other than that I must say that the resort is gorgeous. The enviroment is soothing, and relaxing with nice trance music playing in the background. There are several pools including one with a pirate ship that the kids loved. There was an inflatable obstacle course that was set up that was a great hit. My favorite though was the headed private pool in he Concierge area. Water was not too deep and there was a swim up bar. Considering this resort is an all inclusive, they do not cheap out on the alcohol. The servers and bartenders were absolutely awesome and work really hard to keep you happy and drinking :) The Concierge also included a private chef that grilled burgers, hot dogs, chicken and ribs which were exceptionally tasty. There were also offerings of snow cones, nachos with cheese, cotton candy and popcorn that kept the kids smiling. Only downside was the incecticide that was sprayed around the parimeter of the pool along the bushes and trees. While it made it relitively misquito and insect free, the smell lingered in the air. Probably not the best for our kids. Also, don't forget to bring plenty of suncreen. They sell it at the resort for $35 - $40 a tube and around $30 in town. Another highlight was the kid's Playzone. It offers a rock climbing wall and a reverse bunji jumping trampoline for kids 4 and up.The Paradisus offers a large selection of restaurants to choose from with different international cuisines. The food is spectacular, the best I have ever had at an all inclusive. Our favorite being the Japanese and Brazilian restaurants. I am sure many of you reading this have gone to a Japanese Teppanyaki where they grill food in front of you. Well, the chefs are excellent and keep you amused preparing very tasty food. The Brazilian restaurant offered many samplings of grilled meat that was also very tasty. Perhaps the highlight of this restaurant was the daily featured nightly show that was put on. Professional flame acrobats, belly-dancers and Mayan dancers offered great entertainment. The stage was set up on a large artificial beach which the kids also loved while we drank and danced the night away. Off the resort, Playa Del Carmen offers an extensive array of activites including ATV tours, great snorkeling, watersports, hiking, shopping and awesome parks. The whole resort is gorgeous and very relaxing. The staff is very friendly and work extra hard to try and keep you happy which brings me to the most important part of the review. While the resort itself is beautiful, the surrounding area where it is situated isn't. It is in the middle of perhaps the poorest part of Playa Del Carmen. It is an shock awakening example of opposite lifestyles. The buildings are the worst imaginable slums with citizens sitting on the roadside and pillaging through garbage. It humbles you with sadness. Not something you want to see on vacation. I had a chance to speak with a few staff members and the income they make is very minimal, but they consider it very good. $300 - $700 a month which is barely enough to cover their rent. Pay increases depending on how verse they are with English. I over-tipped this trip because I knew that it was the pure source of their income. Apparently some of the staff even lived in those slums surrounding the resort. I really wished I could do more for them. But all in all the resort is fantastic.

Sure the food was good for an all inclusive and the room was nice and new. However, there were too many negatives. Starting with the drive to the hotel... although others have mentioned the bad neighborhood this hotel was built in, the level of poverty is indescribable. Incredibly sad. Esmeralda is basically a U shape. All rooms either face the interior (a pool area with lots of concrete) or trees. There's no view of a beach from the rooms or the pool area. And to get to the beach, you have to walk through the pool area, past restaurants, down a path past trees and make a left. The sand area is narrow, and they have gray, sling chaises lined up like sardines in two rows. Directly behind the chairs are bushes and trees. There's no restaurant nearby and the bar is back on the path. The ocean was pretty, turquoise and calm, and there are jet skis available. But there are no kayaks, catamarans, aqua bikes, parasailing or even volleyball. The vibe at this place is zen, calm, quiet and basically boring. The music is techno and everywhere. The pool is like a snake, narrow and winding around the rooms... and in the center there's a too-small swim area for a hotel this size. Esmeralda took up a huge amount of the pool area to put in tons of beach beds. But there are no trees, flowers, or waterfalls. It's a huge concrete patio. There are no activities offered at the pool--which is not heated and was freezing. Lunch at the small pool restaurant was very good. The main restaurants have no views of the pool or beach. The restaurants are dark, huge, modern and upscale. There's no sunlight in them at all, as they are surrounded by covered walkways. The food was surprisingly good for an all inclusive, and I'd guess would please anybody...as long as you don't mind eating in the dark. We had a family concierge room-small and pretty, with 2 firm beds. We were able to use the heated pool in this category (with our specific bracelets). The butler made a dinner reservation for us--otherwise we didn't need him. The other \"perks\" were: peanut M&Ms and chocolate milk in the mini bar, and Johnson's baby shampoo, colgate and baby bug lotion in the bathroom. Most important for me (besides of a clean, pretty room and good food) is a great pool to swim in and play with the kids, a big, beautiful beach, and fun water sports at the beach--none of which are here.

The ride down from Cancun was uneventful although it was interesting to see the grand entrances to the other mega resorts along the Mayan Riviera. After passing the other resorts I was extremely concerned when the shuttle driver turned into a rather rundown neighborhood. We drove for about four blocks through the neighborhood before we arrived at the front gate to the property. They really need to do something about the arrival. First impressions count a lot. We had reserved a family concierge room and the shuttle driver dropped us at the regular reception area. If you reserve a family concierge or royal service room there's a separate reception area. Make sure the driver knows where to leave you. Check in was easy and with the family concierge or royal service package you are assigned a concierge who shows you around the property. The place is brand new and one of the nicest places that I have ever stayed. Because it is new the staff went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. The restaurants are fantastic. Make your reservations early or better yet have your concierge make your reservations. The resort is truly all inclusive. The food was excellent and the beverages were all top shelf. I was extremely impressed with the staff who always made sure that I never had an empty glass in my hand. They constantly would refresh my drink without my having to ask. That was great. The resort is actually two resorts. La Perla is adults only and Esmerelda is for families. I was there with my fifteen year old son and he wasn't old enough for the adult side but the family side was really a geared for young children and was rather noisy. On a couple of days my wife and I escaped to the La Perla side leaving our son to take care of himself. I would highly recommend the La Perla side for anyone without children. It was very relaxing. The one drawback is that the resort is adjacent to a very congested neighborhood of Playa del Carmen. On an early morning walk around the property the sound of crowing roosters and barking dogs was very apparent on the neighborhood side of the resort. Thankfully, we were staying on the other side of the property which is adjacent to a mangrove forest. The neighborhood noise is covered by new age music which is piped throughout the resort at all hours of the day and night. One day I decided to go for a jog toward PDC which is about two miles away. I turned left out of the front gate of the resort and after about a hundred yards I was confronted by a pack of neighborhood dogs. I took one look at them and turned and ran back to the resort. I did take my jog along the beach which is very well patrolled and free of wild dog packs.

The rooms are very clean and very modern looking \u2013 we stayed in room 2185 we were facing the back of the hotel with a view of new construction condo\u2019s facing north. We really didn\u2019t mind the lack of view usually they are your quietest rooms. We did find a little noisy when ppl would talk/laughing in the early mornings (4 a.m.) in the hallway which happen twice during our stay. Resort: - The resort is nicely laid out / the modern look of this resort makes it very unique/classy. We loved that we were able to eat and drink at the Perla side as well. In my opinion if we were to visit the resort again I would stay at the Perla side, there were more action/people at the Perla pools. Restaurants: - AMAZING \u2013 We tried all the restaurants at the Perla side and only the Naos and the Market on the Esmeralda side. Breakfast: we ate both at the Naos and Hadar both were good we preferred eating at the Hadar, staff and food was very good and accommodated us with our protein shake requests :-) Lunch: we ate a couple times at The Grill and you have the choice of 3 types of meats, 3 sides and or pasta and pizza. There is a salad bar to help yourself before getting your meal. Most days we ate at Naos \u2013 quick and easy lunch buffet. The chef, Oscar would come out and ask if were happy with the food and service \u2013 he has been a chef at the Iberostar franchises. Dinner: Fuego \u2013 Latin fusion we ate twice at this place. Coconut Cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9 was very good Passion \u2013 you had the choice of ala carte or the tasting menu. We picked the tasting menu and consisted of 9 course meals including 2 desserts \u2013 the chefs offered us an extra dish of lamb. After dinner, the chefs came to our table and introduced themselves. \u2013 I would def. go back for the ala carte selection. The Market if you like meat this place is for your \u2013 they come to your table with 6-8 different types of meats in shish kebab style. Bana was my least favorite place (Asian style meals & sushi). Coupons: - We were given a coupon book to use - $400 upgrade room \u2013 if you were to go to the Royal Service it would have cost an extra $800 including the coupon. There are 4 coupons of $40 each at the spa \u2013 but can only be used for one service at the time. You also have $10 bottle of wine credits if you were to choose from the wine list. Spa \u2013 We spent 4 hours at the spa using the facilities and getting a deep tissue massage and facial for 2 ppl which cost $552.00. There is WIFI throughout the hotel \u2013 bedroom was the most reliable connection. The Gym \u2013 we are regular gym goers \u2013 the facilities is very nice and has tons of potentials, I hear the yoga/pilates and spinning classes were great \u2013 but for those looking to train with weight this resort is really lacking of these equipment\u2019s. I suggest they invest a little more on free weights, a few more benches, bench press, squat rack, a least a cable machine, leg extension and leg curl machine. The Staff are wonderful, very attentive and they try their best to make your vacation memorable. Anything you need ask your concierge that was assigned to you when you arrived. Amigo Eric and Alfredo were the best. They are there day and night, Amigo Eric starts his day at 7 a.m. and still there at 10 p.m. You might be asked to sit at one of their resort presentations which is optional and we did decide to go one morning on a rainy day and I didn\u2019t mind do this favour - Amigo Eric is a hard working guy with a business mind set and I totally respect that. Once you are there, they will explain the program etc.. and of course you might feel pressure for some, be patient and you walk away if you are not interested no hard feelings. Then you will you will receive a $125 melia dollars and 3 night stay at one of the 3 Melia resort in Cancun/Playa del Carmen. We used are full $125 Melia dollars at the Spa. Night life: Hotel was not at its full capacity there werent' many ppl hanging out at the bars. There was a DJ everynight with good house music. Would we go back to this resort \u2013 Absolutely.

Well, firstly, what shocked me the most, is that upon check out, after my fiance and I had already checked out and were waiting for our ride to the airport, a lady came by and wanted to cut off our bracelets. We travel all the time, and have been to a number of all-inclusive resorts. As a tradition, we never take off our bracelets until we get home. So, the lady said we can keep our bracelets but she needs to cut them off. Now, we refused, because the mere essence of this is RIDICULOUS!. Okay, we refused and our van had just arrived, so we proceeded to our ride. As we walked towards the car, we saw this crazy lady running after us, waiving scissors in her hands! Are you SERIOUS? A. Running with scissors? Did she think we would let her touch us with those? B. Running with scissors at a kids resort??? COME ON! That is like a 2 star shab! Okay, second. Their ASIAN food is horrible! I am not Asian, nor am I a cook, but I can make better Asian food than them. After dining in the ASIAN restaurants we were hungry and had to catch up at the buffet! Seriously, a five star resort can hire an actual sushi chef to make sushi that tastes good, or at least like sushi. Instead, they have Mexican guys making sushi, which are absolutely horrendous! Though the employees are very nice, and try their best. -I must give them credit for that. Third. Their activities are scattered and unorganized. Sometimes, the activity list changed 3 times per day, and so did the location of each activity. I did enjoy the activities such as Tango, meringue, and arts and crafts once I actually found them. We spent 6 nights there, and got rather bored after night 4, though we always had access and did visit La Perla. The resorts are similar, one with kids, the other adults only. So, saying that I was bored because I was at La Esmeralda will not work, as we were bored at La Perla as well. Now, the Argentinian Restaurant is great. Unfortunately we only went there on our last day. If known prior, we would have been there every day. The manager was very accommodating and treated us well, and the food was GREAT! The duck was amazing, and the Ceviche, and other dishes as well. I can't remember the names anymore, but my fiance enjoyed his lamb or meat a lot! The market restaurant is okay - the fish dish - not so great! The other outside restaurant -can't remember the name; was great. Raul was the best server by far, so if you get him - you are lucky. The food in the buffet was very good. Breakfast: average - good. Lunch: good - great. Dinner: good. Service in general is good because 95% of the staff tries really hard, but it is true that they are not completely trained for a 5 star service. So, next time I will pay a little more and go to Grand Velas - because I really want better food and better service for the money I am paying. Now comes the BAD part! -Half the staff at the front desk were not great. The women were nicer than the men. They seemed rather arrogant, and I did not like that. Though we could see that they were trying to do their job, we still felt that it wasn't a 5 star service. 1. When we checked in, we completely forgot about our room credit of $350. The staff did not mention anything about it, though it was on the Expedia print outs I provided to them. 3 days later when we remembered about it, and approached the front desk, a nice lady said that we could move into a swim-up pool at no charge since it's in the same category, and the credit would be enough to cover the rest of our stay. OKAY, the next day she wasn't there and none of the other staff knew anything, so instead, an arrogant male offered me to move into a 1 bedroom suite for the rest of my 3 nights and pay him extra money. He mentioned nothing about the swim-up pool. So, we had friends visiting and since we did not want to waste time with this \"gentleman\", we left. Only to approach them the next day, with the same story - \"No one knew what was going on\". So, another nice lady suggested that we use the credit for the SPA, which by the way was unfinished!!! Of course, I declined. (And by the way, I never received the coupons in my hand. EVER! Great scam...) Going forth, we only had two nights left, and this request was not only NOT MET, but it was NOT even paid any attention to. So, finally the lady suggested that because of this inconvenience upon check-out we could receive a free night for future stay. I WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN, but if they gave me a free night or two, I would have sent my parents... However, upon checkout, we were once again met with this arrogant \"gentleman\" - and I am being sarcastic here... He informed us that guests that stayed 7 or 8 nights received a complimentary night to come back. Because we stayed for 6, we will not be receiving it and he does not know anything about our room credit. We were very unhappy, as the resort did not give us the credit or offer an upgrade upon a check-in, they did not provide us with the coupons, and would not accommodate or pay any attention at their LACK of service for 5 times that we inquired about this. So, this arrogant \"gentleman\" said that he would discuss with the manager and e-mail us with options and that he has my e-mail on file from the registration. I asked for a deliverable date, and he said 1-2 days. We came back on January 13th... and I still have not received anything from them. I guess they do not care about honoring their promises, nor do they care about the resort credit that I should have had, nor did they want to amend their POOR SERVICE OF a 1. Okay, I will NEVER be back, and neither will any of my friends. Seriously, I have done a great deal of research on Grand Velas, and spoke to friends who vacationed there. - Go there instead! Now, for the last negative: We had friends visiting, and we called the front desk to ask for the price for them. One person said 120$, the other person said $170. Did the $170 person want to pocket the difference? Then, the lady tried to accommodate us to let our friends pay 60$ for under 4 hours. Seriously not worth it since they had their own resort, but understandable. And now the positive: The resort is really beautiful. The music is great. Once a week circus show was greatly enjoyed. Only problem is that it was not on the schedule and they did not advertise it, so a kind waiter in the lounge told us about it when were were waiting for a show, but there was nothing but trance music! The fire show was great. The belly dancing show was great. The drinks are good, and room service is good. The Hookah is $25. Okay, we bought it, because my fiance likes Hookah, but seriously barely anyone was buying it. If they made it 10-15$ they would make a lot more money, and we would have bought it every night!. As in New York, Hookah is only 10$! The beds by the pool are very comfortable, there is always wi-fi access everywhere. So if you are travelling and need to work, feel free to bring your laptop. The beach was small, but nice. I really liked it. The neighborhood around the hotel is bad, so make sure you do not leave without a cab, and do not explore that area. It is plain dangerous! The resort is safe though. Overall, because I am too nice I gave them a 4. But really I WILL NOT BE BACK. We had a nice vacation, but next time, we will spend more to get better service. And rooms were new, beautiful and good.

The Pool deck: The pool deck is kept super clean modern and very well landscaped - the pool are the cleanest I've seen on a resort ever - Salt water filtration system means you don't come out with smelly chemicals on you (chlorine). We had a 3 month old baby with us and the cabanas where exceptionally useful. Their is also a large amount of them which meant not having to play the reservation game with other guests. Side cushions made them even more comfortable. Pool water was a bit cold but refreshing (family concierge was heated). Pool service staff like Daniel were around every 5 min. to provide amazing service. Food quality was impressive and the service delivered by Estella and Shirley made our visit a remarkable one - these folks were kind and genuine a quality that most resorts lack. The Beach Great beach - love the proximity to Playa del carmen - we jogged it in about 15 min. (slow) nice calm waters and great beach seating / sleeping equipment (very modern). Restaurants Each had contrasting and very different cuisines - not like other resorts where all the food tastes the same and only branded differently We loved the Mexican Restaurant (MOLE) and the Japanese BANA/To-Ji where the food quality was exceptional - the service was remarkable Ruban the manager came to see us personally to ask how everything was, they modified the lighting for us in a private room we had received. I liked a great deal the sashimi. I often find in a resort they usually don't make great sushi. Gabi Club (bar) was really neat The view and the design- however is for adults only; Our Server Omar at Fuego was awesome and the food was delicious if you love ceviches. Vento was the only restaurant where the service and food quality was low - The service lacked the professional attention we received from the other restaurants. NAOS was great for the buffet again food quality was high. We spent many after dinner nights in the lobby bar where Ana and her colleagues remembered our drinks which made ordering a breeze and added that extra touch. What we didn't like: The concierge service (vacation club) makes themselves out to be there to assist you in your every needs - but then become very present / even pushy and you soon discover they are trying to sell you time shares from Melia.com. Basically you are their captive audience and they try all day to get you to sign up for their time share tour. \"AMIGO\" Eric was one that kept insisting, I can't tell you how fake and annoying this guy was - \"You guy's are as precious as diamonds\" - \"The most important guests are you\" - \"I don't want to be too pushy but you should really consider the time share tour\". LEAVE US ALONE !!! We started avoiding him in the hotel halls when we saw him ! A resort of this caliber should not try to up-sell you in this sleazy way. Conclusion: Best resort I've ever been to - food was amazing - Rooms were modern, clean - I definitely plan to go again soon.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "montreal", "Title": "\u201ca great 5 stars\u201d", "Author": "pierreetpierrette", "ReviewID": "UR123083935", "Content": "A true 5 star!

A special word of congratulations to the competent and dedicated teacher who gives yoga, Pilates and stretching classes from Monday through Thursday. The rooms are beautiful and clean, the beach is very nice, full spa service with two whirlpools and a heated pool available free of charge. The great opportunity to come and go in all restaurants without restrictions and the possibility for the occupants of the Esmeralda, go-anywhere all over the site of La Perla, the opportunity to go to the computer and the Internet without any cost, wi-fi available in the rooms and throughout the site. In conclusion, congratulations for this great resort that opened only last November.

It was clear from the beginning that they opened on November 30th. So to all those that wrote bad reviews, you were all aware of this since you did your homework before ever checking in whether on TripAdvisor or the Paradisus.com site itself. My expectations weren\u2019t extremely high but I did expect a clean room, good food, adequate pool side chairs as well as beach too. And I got exactly that. Sure there were some glitches but that was to be expected. A resort such as La Esmeralda & La Perla require 1500 + workers and to have them in tip top shape takes time. That\u2019s why restaurant and clubs usually do soft openings before the grand opening itself. Well hotels & resorts cannot. So again it\u2019s to be expected. During my stay I witnessed countless guests that were fighting with the staff. And it seemed like it was always the same ones, numerous they were but you could tell it was always the same ones that have nothing better to do regardless. Had they been staying in a 6 star they\u2019d be the ones arguing for something? And TripAdvisor has become a weapon of some sort since I often heard \u201cwait till I write my review on this place\u201d. I actually found these little minded people to be entertaining at times. Let\u2019s get down to the pros; La Esmeralda is perhaps the sexiest resort I\u2019ve ever stayed in. The layout and the lighting along with the Bose sound that follows you through the entire resort playing awesome lounge music I\u2019ve never seen. In a 300 square foot area I counted 35 speakers. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t loud it was just relaxing and perfect. The restaurants whether it was the buffet or the a la cartes, they were simply the best we\u2019ve ever had in a resort and then some. The alcohol was a first for me since you never see Grey Goose, Belvedere, aged scotches, liquors and the list goes on and on in a resort. We spent the 31st (New Years Eve) at Gaby lounge bar and it was a blast. They had a la carte champagne for those that didn\u2019t mind spending a few dollars even though it\u2019s an all inclusive and the service was awesome. Keep in mind that a $20 here and there goes a long way for someone who earns $400 a month. So if you want the special attention then don\u2019t be a mooch and throw a few bills around. Overall I rate this resort a 5 star because whether it was when I was there or not it\u2019ll be one once the hotel manager Mr. Santiago Rivera is done fixing the little odds and ends. I myself would like to thank him for making my stay perfect from beginning to end. And to show a little class for someone who was being continuously attacked we went on 5th avenue (100 peso) cab ride and bought him a good bottle of wine with a thank you note. For those of you that didn\u2019t enjoy your stay, it goes without saying that you probably never enjoy yourself regardless because you\u2019re short minded and most likely miserable...... Congrats to all the employees of La Esmeralda & La Perla for keeping your cool and putting up with all the WHINERS and for providing my family with an awesome vacation.

Travelled with our 2 kids (7 and 2 years old), and husband. This is a very new (2 months old?) resort in the Playa del Carmen area. Getting there was a little weird - to get there you have to travel down some streets in Playa del Carmen that are a little rough or impoverished. Wasn't expecting that, a little shocking. The outside of the resort is a little stark, but is quite luxurious looking once inside, and you can't see the outside streets once inside the resort (but you are really close to the streets). The furnishings, decor are all very modern looking (not really \"beachy\"). The resort has an adult side - la Perla. We stayed on the family side - la Esmeralda. As a guest you are welcome to go to the adult side sans kids. We did check it out - its nice. A little quieter on this side - relaxing (no kids running around!). We stayed in a larger suite with a separate bedroom, bathroom (with 2 sinks and large tub) and another bathroom with 1 sink, shower, and toilet; then a large room that had the living room area and a kitchen type area (only a microwave and fridge) and a large eatting area. Nice large balcony with a large round jacuzzi tub. Great room, really nice. The pools are not heated. Kind of a shame for the kids pool. Its nice, big pirate ship with 2 slides off of it but we had some cooler days there over New Years (maybe not the best time of year to be there?) and our daughter who will swim in almost any temperature of water, started to say it was too cold later in the week when the weather cooled down. We were told by the \"pool guy\" that some heating pumps are on their way from Spain and the pool is going to be heated in the future. Will this really happened? Don't' know. I don't think the water temperature is a problem during the hot months, but during cooler times it can be an issue. They have a special \"family concierge\" area of the resort - separate building, pool, concierge staff, every family gets a \"nanny,\" etc. It wasn't for us so we didn't pay for that upgrade - we chose the room upgrade. Heard that perhaps some people were not feeling they got the value they wanted for this?? All I would say is check it out thoroughly if that's what you want. The family pool WAS heated though (we checked it out one day, but we really weren't supposed to be in that area and they did ask us to leave that area). The food was really great. Very high quality and the a la carte restaurants were all really AWESOME, especially the PASSION restaurant (at this restaurant you do have to pay a $40 each surcharge, but it was WELL worth it- highly recommended you try out this restaurant. The service in the main restaurants (not the a la carte) was spotty though. This is one of my beefs. Sometimes it was there and many times it was not - things like getting water, coffee, etc. at your table. Pool drink service was spotty too. My husband spent most of his days at the pool - some servers were great, some were not, and tipping did not seem to make a difference. We are tippers and tipped most wait staff daily. So that was weird - that the tipping didn't seem to help. The food in general is very high quality, very well prepared, tasty. They do a nice job. All alcohol is top shelf. Had some inconsistent service with room service and the front desk (had some laundry done), housekeeping-almost missed us a couple time and had to make repeated phone calls to housekeeping, and bar fridge not alway filled. When something went wrong and we made calls to the appropriate people - it usually took 2-3 calls to get the service. These were not deal breakers, but it was annoying. I am giving them the pass because they are new and just getting things ironed out. The kids club has long hours 9:00 am to 10:00 pm at nite, and they will basically take your kids all day long if you want, and take them for meals and everything. They take kids 2 and up (which was new for me - most other kids clubs we have used take kids 4 and up). for us - our daughter (7) was not totally big on this kids club and usually she loves these things. But we met another couple and their son (also 7), loved this kids club and did not love other resorts clubs so much. The ladies are nice and they have lots of great activities. The 2-4 year olds do different things than the older kids. We also got babysitting in our room a couple notes because our 2 year old could not hack the kids club by himself, for him he's not ready for that kind of situation. The babysitting was fine, but I felt it was expensive - $35 an hour for 2 kids ($25 an hour for 1 kids) plus $10 travel time (USD). I was also annoyed that I was quoted 2 different prices from the front desk (both of which were cheaper than the actual price in the end). Bottom line? This is a really nice resort, great food, good staff (albeit a little confused at times). we WILL definitely be going back. I will expect the service to be better in the future as they iron out the kinks and will not be so forgiving as I was this time.

We had a good holiday and were quite comfortable but part of this was due to enjoying a reunion with two other families we hadn't seen for a while. We are a family of 4, with two boys aged 5 and 8 and had high hopes from this new resort. However, it's clear that it's new on the block and has a few things to sort out. The first thing which stops me from giving it a 5* label is its location. We had expected a hotel right on the beach and rooms with a sea view. However, due to a strip of mangroves that they have had to keep, you can't see the beach unless you are on the third floor. There is only one access to the beach so it's quite a walk to get there. Finally they haven't built a bar on the beach yet, so you need to order your drinks well before you need them as the waiters have to walk miles to get them and bring them to you. My next comment is that the rooms really aren't that large considering how much you pay for them. We were in a junior suite but had just two double beds and a sofa area all in one room. Another gripe is regarding the restaurants that need reservations. Their booking system needs some working out. First they say you can't book a table more than three days in advance, then they tell you that restaurants are booked up for the next four/five days. Finally, although it's a very nice, brand new hotel with good pools etc, the service just isn't up to the 5* level. There are more 'manager-types' standing around asking 'are you enjoying your stay?' than waiters or room-cleaners and quite frankly it's the latter that are more important. So, I would have to say that this is a perfectly fine hotel with three to four star level but it's nowhere near the 5* plus that it's aiming and charging for. Bear in mind though that my five-year-old would say it's fab due to the infinite supply of popcorn and candyfloss and my eight-year-old thought the pirate ship in the kid's pool was great fun despite one trip up which left him with several rather large bruises. A final word of warning. Do not use Olympus tours to get to and from the airport. Firstly because they charge double or more the price of a taxi. Secondly, because their service is terrible. We confirmed the return journey to the airport with them the day before departure but on the day they turned up, waited 15 minutes and then left, despite our luggage having arrived to be loaded onto the van. The van was only for us (a group of 12) but apparently the driver couldn't wait. The hotel didn't help either, the concierge called our rooms but didn't think to call the reception in our area which is where we were as we were checking out and waiting for a shuttle to take us to the main lobby but which we were then told wouldn't take us there, hence our being late.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cAmazing All Inclusive for Family\u201d", "Author": "tk7754", "ReviewID": "UR122800905", "Content": "It has been 2 weeks since we left Paradisus La Esmeralda; we miss it so much we wish we were still there. La Esmeralda deserves to be rated as a 5 star luxurious all inclusive resort despite some kicks needed to be ironed out. La Esmeralda is in another league above all other competitors. We're a family of 4 (daughter 14, son12). When we arrived on12/17, the resort was quiet, we enjoyed great services, when we left on 12/25, the resort was nearly full, it felt different, the services were slow and supply was short, but it didn't matter, there were so many enjoyable, they were quickly forgotten. We had a memorable visit. Transportation \u2013 We had a private van service from www.cancun-cab.com, it was prompt and reasonable. La Esmeralda was 40 minutes from Cancun airport. Location \u2013 La Esmeralda is approx. 1 1/2 miles north the center of Playa Del Carmen. We had a pleasant walk on the sandy beach to the Ferry/center, it took about 45 minutes. You could catch a taxi back to the resort if you want to spend some time in town. Staff \u2013 They were hard working, courteous and eager to serve the guests. They were mostly well trained and professional. When we arrived at the resort, a lady opened our car door with cool drinks in hand and a smile, she said to us \"welcome home\". That started a relaxing and warm tempo for our vacation. Beach \u2013 Beautiful, clean and quiet with superior quality piraguas and chaises. The beach had few rocks, but you just go left a few yards to enter the ocean. Great service on the beach, bar stations were being built. Decor - Architecturally beautiful, dramatic & detailed thru out the property. Room - Spacious, clean, lot's of storage space, comfy beds and pillows. Good A/C. Large flat screen TVs. Spacious bathroom with giant towels. Mosquito was ignoring (Bring bug spay, should turn off the balcony lights at night). We unfortunately had mouse in the room 2 nights from the neighborhood housings, the maintenance people did come immediately to take care of it. The dog barking from the neighborhood was loud some days. Internet service \u2013 Everywhere in the property, what a treat, check emails by the pool\u2026 Restaurants \u2013 Each Restaurant had its own ambiance and uniqueness. Food was mostly delicious and creative; the quality was so good we didn\u2019t believe we were in all inclusive resort. The house wine and liquor were above the standard quality. The service was fantastic especially when the occupancies were lower in the beginning of our staying. The staff was working so hard to accommodate when more guests arrived, you can't help being understandable and be patient. I love it each time waiter would come to our table and said \u201cMy name is XXX; it\u2019s my pleasure to serve you today\u201d Paradisus La Esmeralda will only get better as it matures each day; I can sense their vision for their high standard of service. Thanks and keep up with the good work! Excursion \u2013 We had our own snorkel gears so we decided to rent a car for 2 days from \u201cDollar\u201d (at the resort). We wanted to be free and didn\u2019t want to be restricted and waste time if joining Best Day Tours. It turned out driving in Riviera Maya was a breeze despite the warning we heard about Mexico. The roads are well marked and you travel mostly on the highways. You just need to respect the traffic signs and speeds. We did buy full insurance coverage to be safe. We had great fun snorkeling 2 hours at Yal-ku Lagoon; we lunched nearby at the funky beach front \u201cLa Buena Vida\u201d. We toured the Tulum Ruin. On another day, we visited \u201cCenote Dos Ojos\u201d near Tulum, it was awesome and unusual (do hire the private tour guide once you\u2019re there, otherwise, you will get lost inside and a long walk from parking). We went back to Akumal Bay, parked our car in front of \u201cLol Ha\u201d for fresh cut coconut juice, best tortilla chips w/guacamole and salsa. We then swam toward the docked boats in the bay with our snorkel gears and saw Sting Rays and huge Sea Turtles, what a thrill. We drove south 20 minutes to Tulum Beach Road, parked our car at \u201cAna Y Jose\u201d, we bounced with the waves, hung out at their gorgeous white beach and watch the sunset. Suggestion - 1. Need more than one tennis court. 2. Control Mosquitoes - We couldn't sit on the balcony due to Mosquitoes. The housekeepers need to keep the doors closed when cleaning. 3. Need nightly live entertainment for kids, not just Kids\u2019 Club. My kids were asked to leave Gabi one night (it was opera singing), and then other nights we saw kids stayed for belly dancing. 4.

Got there on December 31st, so roughly 4 weeks after opening. We arrived with a mix of excitement and apprehension, given some of the negative reviews we had read online. Fortunately, while we noticed some of the shortcomings identified by others, we either thought they were normal for a new property or simply not things big enough to affect the overall enjoyment of a vacation. Yes the resort is right by a less than desirable part of town but you only really see it on the way in or out... Yes there will be glitches for the opening period but is a missing flat iron really a vacation-ruiner?! So no, the place isn\u2019t perfect but pretty close to it in our books and the better it\u2019ll get over time. It made for an excellent vacation with the desire to return at this Paradisus or others in the not too distant future. We were most impressed by the resort's design and its staff friendliness and absolute desire to assist. The place is simply gorgeous and not the typical brightly colored all inclusive. The design is refined and tasteful. Of particular note is how they integrate nature throughout the place, from the mangroves to the koi ponds to the atrium with lush greeneries, it all blends in with the architecture. As for the staff, we met very few who didn't genuinely want to help. Yes of course they are lacking practice in some cases and procedures may not be all set but they do want to help and no doubt it'll get better over time. That being said, for a place that just opened, it was pretty darn good: room service came in 30 minutes, turndown was done while out for dinner, bellboys always around to call a taxi, etc. Other highlights include the beach. Although it is narrow and there are some rocks, great fine sand and clear water. Ditto with the pool area. Not the conventional pool and we liked that! Meanders around the resort with swin up rooms and little jaccuzi nooks along the way. We also thought the food options were plentiful and generally more than satisfying. Some finetuning to do here (like not overcooking meat or fish) but for an all inclusive, it was above par (that Guacamole was to die for). And we were told the place was close to full... If true, this resort will have an outstanding space per guest ratio. The public spaces were never, never full... Finally, the areas to improve. First, check in, as others have said. Staff was again really nice but seemed overwhelmed with guests coming in and housekeeping not churning out rooms fast enough or ensuring that they were ready to be occupied. Our first had an obvious water leak. Had to wait for another one (got a free massage as compensation). Second, heat up those pools! I know it\u2019s Mexico and very hot most of the time but in the colder months, it is necessary. Al in all, gorgeous resort and oustanding vacation.

We had mixed feelings going to a brand new hotel and reading some early bad comments. We stayed between Dec 30-Jan 6. The New Year's celebration was phenomenal. Over the top. With fireworks and all. The hotel was full capacity (as they claimed) but you could easily find a nice spot on the beach or on the pool. No shortages of anything, they had tons of towels and tons of the fresh mint for the double-shot dark-rum mojito's. The pool water was freezing, there was nobody in the water, except kids playing on the pirate ship. But interestingly, it didn't seem to bother us. Yes, occasionally there were minor hiccups, such as your room keys not working or room floors not being vacuumed, and although there was an occasional urge to log onto tripadvisor and give it a one-star rating, the bad feelings disappeared within minutes, when you just walked through the resort or enjoyed their amazingly great food. Everything was so tasteful. There as absolutely nothing that would even remotely taste weird or unusual. Their waiters, however, range from upscale professional to completely amateur (I mean the one who would anticipate all your needs or bring you amazing tropical drinks to accompany your lunch, or another one who has no clue was a decaf is, or decaffeinated coffee, or \"no caffeine coffee\", or would bring you something else, if at all). Book the restaurant reservations on the first day. Try to get 7pm or 8pm reservations, as 6pm is too early. Kids enjoyed the Kid's club tremendously. The resort's Kid's club has tons of activities, they even take your kids to lunch and dinners, so go ahead and book the adults-only restaurants. Nightlife was unexpectedly great. They had a couple of shows. Our kids loved the Lion King Show, it was beautiful. The Circus Show on another night was great too. There were many unexpected professional entertainers throughout the evenings, even after the hotel emptied shortly after the Near Year's weekend. The beach is just a few steps away.

We were there Dec 24th for one week, the two of us plus our two daughters (5 and 3). We stayed at the Family Concierge part of the hotel. We have been to many 5 star resorts in the Caribbean... Paradisus La Esmeralda is by far the most enjoyable family resort in all aspects. The hotel is luxurious in every detail with fine design, decor, lighting, scent and facilities (SPA, gym, pools, etc.). The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with state of the art accessories and high quality equipments. The beach is beautiful and nicely equipped. The many pools are nicely designed with one equipped for the kids, one for Family Concierge tenants and many others. The food is excellent with many restaurants to choose from and fine cuisine to experience. Our daughters loved the kids club and all the activities. Overall, the service was fabulous and everyone was mobilized to make our stay the most enjoyable. The Family Concierge stuff was very friendly and most helpful 24h/day. We had a personal Family Concierge. In addition, you will be lucky if you meet Luciana. She is very competent and pro-active. She will anticipate your needs and make your wishes come true. A true pearl! Among the excellent a la carte restaurants of the hotel, don't miss VENTO, a Mediterranean-style cuisine offering the finest gastronomic experience and an outstanding service.

All in all we had a very good experience, our 3 kids had the time of their lives. On a positive side: 1. Staff is friendly and always willing to help. I have stayed in another Paradisus resort in the Dominican Republic and was surprised by how people seemed to be doing you a favour all the time. At La Esmeralda everyone was fantastic. The people from the Kidszone were great with our kids. Also, Zezinho, who welcomed us when we arrived and took us on a tour of the resort, as we arrived pretty late, was great with us. 2. Rooms, they have everything we needed. We stayed at a Family Concierge suite 3. Food, is plentiful and quality is what we expected. I reccomend the Teppanyiaki at Bana, kids have a blast with the cooking show. 4. Resort location and beach. Close enough to the Playa del Carmen center, and at the best part of the beach in the whole Playa. On a less positive note: 1. Room cleaning service still needs some tuning. One of the days our room was not clean at 5pm, and we asked for it to be done then. Maid appeared at 9pm when our jet-lagged kids were already sleeping. 2. Am not completely convinced that Family Concierge service is worth the extra cost. The advantages I saw are that you get the best part of the beach exclusively for you, you have a dedicated pool (the only heated pool I saw at the resort) and restaurant, and your concierge has a better chance of being able to book the restaurant you want. I believe I paid $1000 more to have this, so I am not sure whether is worth it. All in all, I would surely go back. We loved the Riviera Maya and will try to go back.

This hotel has definite potential however, If you are traveling to Playa del Carmen in the near future-pick another hotel. They have too many issues to iron out. Our check-in was fine. We got two rooms. One for my husband and I and one for my three kids ages, 14, 16, 18. The rooms are spacious and beautiful. My room had a beautiful view of the pool and ocean. The kids' room faced the one tennis court, parking lot and unfinished landscaping. The hotel itself is also very attractive and spacious. Several restaurants and bars on both the Esmerelda side and the La Perla, adults only side. The food is fine and occassionally quite good. There is one fine dining establishment for an upcharge. The excersizing room is fine but very small for so many guests. Only one facility for all hotel guests. I took a spin class that was very poorly taught and only 10 bikes. The positive-beautiful hotel. Comfortable beds. Big obsorbent towels. Nice that there is a stocked refridgerator in the room. Swim up rooms available (my kids thought that was the coolest but we did not pay the extra fee for them). Swim up bar. Lovely stretch of beach with umbrellas and chairs. Plenty of clear blue-green water to swim in without rocks though there is a bit of a rocky area to. Nice sand. Incredibly hard working beach staff. Constantly trying to help guests and lugging many coolers filled with drinks for guest to various stations along the beach. (I imagine they will improve this system as time goes on). I have nothing but compliments for the beach staff. There are water sports available for a fee, on the beach. We also had a nice experience with Marco, one of the concierges. He very patiently walked us through all the hotel areas and explained how the hotel works. He was able to secure dinner reservations for us for several nights. Negatives-the staff is inexperienced and how helpful they were varied greatly. Upon inspecting our rooms, we found that the kids' shower was broken and the room safes were not secured down and we could not open them. It took several inquiries with the front desk before someone came to take care of it. Also, we requested morning maid service (which we were told we could do-no problem) upon check-in. We did not receive morning servicing of our rooms until our fifth day there. We continued to request it every day! One day we came back to our room from a morning trip snorkeling, to find our rooms had not been done. We were out of toilet paper and the kids had no shampoo. Part of the reason for this is that the maid staff don't seem to have a good system for cleaning the rooms. One day the sink wasn't cleaned. They often didn't put out replacements for shampoo etc., The shower is large and very pretty. The drain is on an end. You don't step on it as you shower; however, it was never once cleaned the drain while we were there. There are several rugs on the floor but they don't vacuum the rugs. They never cleaned the make-up mirror. After being there two nights, my daughter complained that she was freezing every night. I hadn't noticed earlier, but the two double beds in the kids' room didn't have the comforters on them! When we spoke to the front desk staff about this, the woman actually argued with us and then told us the blankets were extra! It wasn't until we asked to speak to a manager and another staff person at the desk spoke to her that they managed to come up with the blankets. Blankets for the beds extra? Seriously? Another issue that did get better as the days went on was the lack on consistent availability of towels at the pool and beach throughout the day. They ran out our first few days. Also, if you want a cabana by the pool or an umbrella at the beach, you had better get up early. People save their space by 8-8:30 everyday! But hange on to yesterday's towel or bring one from your room. Towels weren't available until 8:15 or 8:30 every day.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "salt lake city", "Title": "\u201c\"Houston, we have a problem!\"\u201d", "Author": "tbrash", "ReviewID": "UR122331388", "Content": "We stayed at La Esmeralda from Dec. 21st to the 29th. Let me preface this review by telling you we did enjoy our vacation and being aware of their recent opening we knew there would be kinks to work out. The Hotel probably opened too soon for the Holidays. When we arrived and for the next 2 days the landscapers were working hard to finish landscaping the entry and around the pool. They had trees and ornamental grasses to plant as well as water plants and koi for the front pond area. As you arrive at the entrance to the Hotel, the driveway is not finished and very bleak looking. Cement balls line the driveway and the adjoining neighborhood is dismal. I can't believe how delapitated the surrounding houses are and it looks like a land fill across the street probably from the construction. When we arrived they ushered us over to Family Concierge to check in. I did not reserve rooms in FC because I have two older teen girls and thought FC would be better for small kids. Well they upgraded us to FC at no extra cost so I thought we would just go with it and see how it works. I had requested 2 connecting rooms or at least close to each other with ocean view. We got ocean view rooms on two different floors. If my girls were young, this would not have worked for us. Check in took forever and several different people were trying to help us and none of them were overly comfortable with their position. I think everyone at the hotel could use more training! The rooms look just like online. They were nice except I couldn't stand the toilet. It has a seat that slopes , not flat. The sheets are 50% cotton and 50% polyester...scratchy! Even my 15 year old figured that one out fast. They need nicer sheets and towels at these prices! The buildings are loud because they are all travertine tile. Doors slam and because we were in the FC building, kids wake up early and so that means you wake up early too! We could hear the disco music from the Gabi Bar a couple nights till 1:00 am. Drunk parents coming in at 4:00 am pounding their door because they don't have a key. A couple of nights they were doing construction on the Presidential Suite above us till midnight! When someone moved into that room i could hear the woman walking on the travertine in her high heels late at night! I didn't sleep very well there. The FC pool is ALL kids. This is why we didn't sign up for FC because i could tell it really caters to children. I feel like teenagers under 18 are left out. We usually went to the beach and then after Christmas when the crowds came it was a mess with kids and families. After a while when we needed to get out of the sun we would go to the Adult side and sit under their thatched roof huts for some peace and quiet. In fact, we started eating in the adult buffet for breakfast because we couldn't stand all the noise in the Naos buffet with kids. My girls are 15 and 18 and mature. They are well traveled and educated. My 15 year old looks older and we just pretended she was 18. The FC is suppose to make dinner reservations for you 3 days in advance while the \"regular\" people can only call 1 day ahead for reservations. Well, I'm not sure FC have much pull. Some times it was a battle getting a reservation around 7:00 like we wanted, but for the most part he came through with something after talking with his supervisor. Bana didn't have us down for a reservation our second night there and we had to wait 30 minutes off to the side and then i told the host he had to find a table for 4 somewhere in the restaurant. We ended up at the sushi side which was good, but it took 1.5 hours for dinner. We also wanted to eat at Passion for my 50th Birthday. FC get one free dinner there with your stay. Our concierge finally got us in at 8:00 and I couldn't believe how vacant the place was! Only 3 other tables were filled. Unfortunately the duck that my daughter and I had was awful! Couldn't even chew it. Tough, tough, tough! The fish my husband and other daughter had was better. It was a disappointing dinner, I'm glad we didn't have to pay for it! We went on 2 tours with Best Day and had a good experience. We went to the Spa and it was fine. We used our credits on some of the services. We didn't buy bottles of wine and i wish we would have. They are big on Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay from Argentina and they are horrible! We resorted to drinking the Cava from Spain. It was good. One problem with FC at the beach is that they aren't checking bracelets and people from non FC were there taking all the big padded lounge chairs and umberellas. There was a shortage of everything! Towels, lounge chairs, umberellas. The guys at the beach have to be the hardest working people around! They are constantly running to get something for someone. People saving lounge chairs at the pool and beach was a BIG problem! On Christmas morning everything was saved at the FC pool by 8:00. I felt like the hotel could use more service people. At breakfast they fill your \"little\" coffee cup and you have to keep flaging them down for a refill. They need bigger coffee cups. I felt like they need more house keepers. 2 days in a row my girls' room didn't get cleaned. The day after Christmas was a mess. Noone's room in the building was cleaned until late. The public restrooms were always a mess. Water everywhere. Dark, not well lit. It looked like the tile on the toilet stalls was breaking and the grout was coming apart. I don't feel like any of the construction dust anywhere through out the whole hotel was ever cleaned up!!

The hotel is beautiful, very tastefully decorated, and very clean. There is still some construction in process but the noise and nuisance of that are minimal. We were very happy with our accommodations: an enormous suite with a large salon, eating corner, two bathrooms, one with a twin shower, a large bedroom with a huge, very comfortable bed, and a large terrace with a jacuzzi big enough for two, a table and chairs for eating, and a sitting corner. It was all kept immaculately clean. The pools are lovely, the beach is great but you have to watch out for rocks under water. The food is varied and of great quality, with many restaurants to choose from. What I don't understand is that in an all-inclusive resort they have a restaurant (Passion) where you have to pay. This is also not clearly indicated anywhere and we only found out after we tried to make a reservation.The service in all the restaurants is excellent, although sometimes rather slow, especially in Vento. The best waiters were Jes\u00fas at the Mole restaurant and Jos\u00e9 at Hadar. They were friendly but not in an exaggerated way, efficient, and aware of every detail. The worst waiter, who so overdid his \"friendliness\" that it gave us the creeps and at the same time was very inefficient, was the one at the Sushi section of Bana. Unfortunately I did not get his name, since we rushed out of the restaurant as soon as we were done and he was not in sight. Our very best experience was with the animation team, especially Iv\u00e1n, who is fun and genuinely warm-hearted and friendly. He made our stay so much more fun, from day one, since he helped us form a great group of people who played volleyball together every day. Iv\u00e1n and Mart\u00edn also made the dance lessons fun and did not show off their own skills, as is often done by members of animation teams. The village of Playa del Carmen is very nice, although you should try and venture away from 5th Avenue, which after a while becomes very annoying with all the pushy vendors. If you happen to be Catholic or would just like to see how people worship, go to the Iglesia del Carmen on a Sunday. It is a lovely little church and they have beautiful music and a great priest. Being at mass with the people who live here gives you a much more authentic experience. Hint: don't ask the chef of Hadar about the names of fruits. He gave me a vulgar answer which unfortunately I understood perfectly. Also, don't check out until you have all your luggage out of the room and do not need the key anymore. They will not complete the check-out until you return the key but they do start the credit card process, so you may be charged twice. We don't know this for sure, because we have not yet received our credit card statement.

Yes. We, too, were skeptical because of the mixed reviews we read on this site. However, I can report that we, along with many other seasoned travelers, absolutely loved the resort and highly recommend it to families. The hotel and grounds are beautiful. The layout is smart. Even the food and drink were excellent for an all-inclusive. Here are some points to consider: 1. Location: It was a short 35-minute ride from the airport to the hotel. We took one of the Best Day private vans to and from the airport as we had arranged via expedia.com. The hotel is self-contained in the north part of Playa del Carmen. While the entrance is under construction and you drive through a poor part of the town, complainers on this site should go to Costa Rica or Puerto Rica or Jamaica and then write about poverty next to opulence. We were not the least bit concerned by the poor housing outside of the hotel grounds. Not once did we see someone from the town hawking his or her wares on the beach. In Jamaica, the people don't leave you alone. 2. Activities: Our 9-, 7- and 4-year-old kids had a ball from sun up until well after sun down. The activities in the kids club were well-organized and supervised. I was impressed -- much more so than what we've seen at other family resorts. The counselors were so energetic and caring. My kids ate many of their meals with their group and didn't want to leave the club room or game room. 3. Service: I am sorry. You complainers need to expect what we experienced, which was inconsistent service due to the newness of the resort. In some restaurants the service was disorganized. However, the managers and waiters went out of their way to make it up to you. And when you sat by the pools or on the beach, you were greeted by helpful servers who brought drinks, snacks and other items to pamper you. 4. Pools: The water was refreshing. Who wants a heated pool in Mexico? We don't have a heated pool in Miami. My kids and other children spent many hours playing together at the Pirate's pool, where there are a few water slides. I swam in the large, meandering pools in front of the hotel rooms. 5. Food: Excellent variety and selection for an all-inclusive!! What more can I say? I travel every week of the year for business. I have stayed with my family at Ritz-Carlton and Four Seasons properties. We have been to Beaches by Sandals ( yuck! awful food and lousy service in Turks and Caicos) and Club Med (even a bigger yuck in terms of rooms, food and overall service!!). I think that the Melia executives have a winner on their hands with this beautiful resort.

My sister can not get in some restaurants because it is only for adults over 18 years, but all the common facilities are surrounded by very small kids who makes a huge noise, for example, we went to dinner at the buffet, and there was a employee with a group of kids who only made noise, who likes dining in these conditions? Probably, while their parents have dinner in the adults section, others have to deal with their children noise. and i'm not speaking of the noise during the day. Note that I understand the concept of the hotel for families. Just did not expect to have dinner with a group of 15 kids to make huge noise, probably while their parents are having the rest in adults section. The holidays are not what I was thinking we'd get. - The rooms are not well insulated. At any hour of the night you can hear children screaming in the aisle, people banging doors, sneezing, people screaming ... ok may not be hotel's fault of having people who makes noise in the hallways during the night, but not becomes very appealing deal with that during one week that you think you will be resting...waking up at night with people and kids talking in the hallways is not what I supposed to be resting. - When we arrived on Monday and it was the worst check in a hotel we have ever had. Super long, and noted the lack of experience of employees. well, I give a 3, but with hope that will become better in future, but I don't think that we come back here.

The (considerable) challenges are all connected to the fact that this is a brand new property: 1) Staff unseasoned with not great English skills -- lots of dropped balls, many requests not fulfilled 2) didn't answer their restaurant reservation line the entire time we were there - needed to go to the front desk to make them, 3) very noisy due to the design of the atriums and hallways -- like a gigantic echo chamber resounding with slammed doors and crying children from a VERY early hour. Not sure what they can do about this -- carpet the hallways, soundproof the doors?, 4) Check in and check out very arduous -- their systems are quite poor. So if you are already booked, you will need to be patient or your vacation will be quite stressful. Make restaurant reservations in advance. Bring earplugs if you want to sleep late. Confirm all accomodations in advance. Don't assume anything when you check in -- make sure they are clear what you requested and then ask again. If you haven't booked, I'd wait for at least six months until the kinks have been worked out. You should check TripAdvisor over time to see if the negative comments like this one decrease proportionately. I predict that there will be a huge number of negative reviews when the many demanding New Yorkers we observed arriving after Christmas return after the new year. If anyone from Paradisus Corporate headquarters is reading this review, you may want to parachute some senior managers into this obviously very large investment to get things on track. On-property management seems nowhere in sight. You should also admonish your marketing department for an extremely deceptive \"grand opening promotion\". We thought we had $1,400 in resort credits for our 8 day stay, but were told upon arrival that \"Terms and Conditions\" apply meaning that the $1,400 is essentially a coupon book to be applied toward services. So a $140 massage can be be reduced to $100 with a maximum $40 coupon, or a $60 bottle of wine to $50 with a maximum $10 coupon. I figured that we would have needed to spend $5,000+ on services to use the entire $1,400. This may have been effective in hoodwinking people to come in the first place, but I can assure you that it also guarantees that people will not come back.

Arrived in our room (we were the first to occupy). The toilet was dirty, no batteries in the remote control and stickers were still on the doors and furniture. We arrived after 7 and were hungry. We went to two restaurants that both said we needed reservations. (You need to call between 9 and 5). Not sure why as they were all empty. After a long wait they agreed to seat us at Bano, the Japanese restaurant. The food was ok. We called the next day to make reservations and were told that most restaurants were booked we could only get a seating at 6 pm. We were promised that a manager would call but no one ever did. In 6 nights never saw any restaurant full. The food is not great and we ate in town twice. If you are going to play tennis this is not the place for you! There is one court, no water fountain or shade and you need to reserve gthe court in advance by the pool. The problem is that a freelance \"pro\" reserves most of the times for lessons. Here are the positives. The beach and pool area are beautiful and the dining, housekeeping and pool staff could not be any nicer. We enjoyed our stay. Here was the icing on the cake. We booked early and received a $350 per room resort credit. Upon check out we were told that the credit was not for Passion restaurant (the only restaurant with an upcharge) and it was only for 30% off the spa service. We ended up getting the full cost but BEWARE! To sum it up, management is nonexistent.

Last year we stayed at Grand Velas - which is a 10+ (no one has rooms like that place, but you are never in them). This by comparison is a 9.8. Service is great, Jose, the family concierge, is the man. He got our 'lost' luggage delivered from the airport with no effort on our part, made our reservations, and is just a peaceful sweet man. Food & Entertainment. There are many restaurants and all are beautifully designed and architecturally interesting. The food is very good, and in my opinion, better than Grand Velas ---especially the authentic mexican cuisine (not at the restaurant, but Noas). For those less adventurous, you can have any type of meat grilled without spices at every meal. This hotel is very european, and has a nice evening activities -- live music (one night violinist, the other saxophone etc) and dancing at the cool bar by the beach. While there were some workman putting finishing touches, it was not disruptive and thought they are still working out kinks (getting enough beach towels distributed throughout the day) I did not experience anything that constitutes bad service --- especially but for 2 weeks after opening most things were in perfect order and the staff was extremely accommodating, and apologetic when some request was delayed or not available. My husband's favorite meal was the duck (perfectly cooked) and ceviche at Fuego, and of course our waiter -- Nicholas. We generally have low expectations of food on our vacation because we live in a big city and don't expect/nor care about having \"amazing meals\" so this duck was a surprise. Of course, breakfast is great -- fresh bed, eggs any style plus some classic mexican tamales. While I rarely exercise on vacation, this place was awesome. I made it a point to go to the classes almost every day. The yoga teacher, Wilhem, is charming and knows his stuff. His classes were hard ----, and the spin instructor outrageous !!! I have never been to a resort where the exercise classes are packed. Lastly and most important is not what I think but my children. If my kids do not have a good time, then I do not have a vacation. The kids club kept our children entertained morning through night and provided them with meals. Sandra and other childcare staff are fabulous, and they all got to participate in the \"Lion King production\" put on by the staff. In addition, they took them outside to swim, bungy jump and other sporty activities in their kid zone area. My daughter made great friends ---her new best friend from England and another from Spain. Additionally, she walked around with a spanish cheat sheet so she could speak with the younger children. So nice to spend time at a resort where you do not run into your neighbors. One downside is that the pools were not heated -- I am not sure if that's because it just opened so the water temperature had not been warmed or b/c the pools are every extending throughout the resort. Most people did not seem affected, however, for my husband, who hates cold water, his love was tested each time he went into the water to play with my son. Fortunately, the ocean was warmer and we hung and swam on the beach. After going to several \"resorts\" -- including the nicer ones like Ritz, this place had plenty of lounge chairs and premium seating/cabanas/couches with umbrellas -- so it did not seem like guests were waking up at the crack of dawn in a frenzy to reserver chairs, or paying off the pool helpers to save chairs (something that you must do at Grand Velas despite what they say --we spent $100 US to get beach cabanas last year). In fact, every day, we finished breakfast around 11 and never had a problem getting a cabana on the beach or at the pool. My only recommendation is that they get an onsite ATM machine -- we ran out of cash for the cab ride back and getting a cash advance from the hotel was a little complicated. FYI -- american's, note the cigarette packs with the \"visual warnings\" that your lobbyist prevented from being implemented in the United States. My kids saw the pack and \"mouth cancer/tumor\" and i think are deterred from smoking cigarettes for life.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cWorst check in I have ever encountered\u201d", "Author": "mexico888", "ReviewID": "UR122119311", "Content": "We just checked in today. We arrived at 1pm, booked 2 suites at 700/night/room. They were suppose to be ocean view, instead we got a view of apartment buildings. They claimed a room was ready, but the maid was still cleaning when we walked in. They then decided to \"upgrade\" us to a master bedroom suite and a one bedroom suite on the ground floor. There was no view, but when walked into a room, the bath tub wasnt installed, and the room was still work in progress. They then told us that they would have 2 rooms for us on the second floor, just needed to freshen it up, so few more minutes. It was 3pm at that point. We went to lunch to give them some time. But when we came back we were given the same story, except now our rooms are on the 4th floor. We waited for another half an hour, finally one room was ready, and we were told the other room would be ready in 10 min. We waited for another hour, with no key for the other room. We then figured out that they have dropped off those keys in the room. Now, one would wonder how we were suppose to get in a room without a key in order to retrieve the key given to us. After we managed to get into our room, my husband and I found out they have given us 2 double beds instead of a king size bed in a master suite. When I called the general manager about it, she told me that she didn't know we wanted a king size bed!!! It was only discussed over and over again with 3 different people. We are exhausted over getting our rooms, and this is only our first day here. Checking in is the first impression a hotel could make on its guests. I have stayed at many hotels and this is the worst I have ever encountered. For all of these issues, we have been offered a free a la carte dinner tonight, but this is an all inclusive resort... This is a brand new hotel, their computer system is not up to snuff( or the staff is not trained to use it properly), the staff is not very seasoned. Maybe it will get better later, but for the kind of money they are charging, I would consider other better known hotels..", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london,uk", "Title": "\u201cNot Quite Paradise\u201d", "Author": "thetoothdoc", "ReviewID": "UR122098181", "Content": "I have recently posted a review on the sister hotel La Perla but having returned home wanted to post some additional information which the site will not allow you to do , but as the hotels form part of the same complex its possible to write here. Although La Perla is for adults only and La Esmeralda is for all , at the moment this hotel appears cheaper BUT there is nothing to stop adults booking for this side of the property and using the adult only facilities and restaurants and the rooms are of a similar quality . Those that want a nice beach might be disappointed , its long but in some areas only 8 feet deep and its quite rocky where the water meets the beach . The pool areas however are good . We arrived when the hotels were quiet and all was great . We left on the 24th as the hotel got busier at which time things may have been going slightly amiss. The hotel appeared to run out of beach towels as the towel huts started using bath towels . Restaurant bookings became more difficult to make , whilst checking out someone was checking in for 5 days and wanted to make a reservation for Passion restaurant and was told only 18:00 slots were available . We ate twice in the Market restaurant ( Brazilian ) the second time the meat was undercooked , burnt on the outside and raw on the inside , service was slow and we had to ask several times for the drinks to be refilled , the answer from the restaurant manager \" its busy !\" The buffet restaurant is opposite and my wife got some roast chicken from there for the table ! Same with the Bana Fusion restaurant , food was good quality but the waiter got the orders wrong and it took 2 hours for our meal . All the restaurants semed to be amazed that we wanted a table for more than 4 people , there were only 6 of us , so I dont know how they will cope with bigger parties . Our rooms seem to be cleaned at different times each day and I dont know who was responsible for the cleaning of the common areas but my wife wrote \"clean me \" on the mirror outside our room which remained there for 4 days . Individual experience do vary but I couldnt give a 5 star rating at this time and indeed it will be interesting to see how the hotels cope this week when it should reach peak occupancy . With regard to position , this hotel has been built relatively late in the development of Riviera Maya and I expect the prime sites have already gone , as mentioned the beach is not great and just outside the high wall are the rather seedy residential areas of Playa Del Carmen , we didnt hear many dogs but there is NO way I would consider a walk outside the property . I have been to several other properties around Playa Del Carmen and whilst at first the property appears very large its actually quite compact compared to some . There is only 1 tennis court secreted away at the beginning of the property , no tennis pro ( as yet ?) and no arranged groups . Build quality seems good but lots of finnishing going on but I have seen this level of ongoing maintenance at other hotels . With so many new rooms its obviously difficult to maintain standards , we had cables missing from our DVD player to connect to the TV and our remote had no batteries , but apart from that all worked as it should , its an interesting concept to think that you may be the first person to sleep in the bed .

So we got the quiet end before the Christmas crowd rolled in. The service was amazing everyone was super accommodating. Yes the hotel is brand new and they were finishing certain parts but that was to be expected. Special mention - Patricia at the front desk is very knowledgeable and actually relates really well to families with kids, seek her out if you need things done. The place definitely caters to children. The kiddie day care is great. They have many activities and take children 1 year old and up. The main pool has a great pirate ship with water slides. There's a kiddie pool and towel huts stuffed with toys and activities. Also we loved the cabanas around the pool . There are many and even when it got crowded we managed to find one in the middle of the day . It's nice not to have to bargain and 'reserve' things for the next day. The beach is set up nicely however for the nicer water entrance you have to walk towards the public area or the beach beyond la esmeralda. Now for the negatives. We completely agree with previous reviewer that once the crowds rolled in they were greatly understaffed. I don't know what Melia management is thinking opening a month before christmas and screwing up so badly. Word of mouth (or tripadvisor) can make you or break you. One day they are out of towels, the next day out of apple juice, then straws. Really? And the non-confrontational problem management is not a way to go. If i asked for apple juice don't tell me i'll get it in 5 minutes and then run away and hide from me. Tell me. I'm ok with orange juice. I'm not ok waiting for apple for an hour to find out that there is none in the first place. Also this is a family resort the waiting staff needs to have their priorities straight. First, you get the kids drinks THEN you refill the adults. We got 3 fills of wine before my kids got their drinks. After asking politely 5 times (including a supervisor) i went to the bar myself. That is not acceptable. So overall we enjoyed our stay despite above mentioned problems. We knew that the place just opened and there'll be kinks to work out so our patience level was relatively high. It is a very pleasant place with very nice people. Love their decor. And the room upgrade we got was also very nice. PS Try your best not to deal with BestDay which is Esmeraldas may agent for attractions.

The dinner service takes close to couple of hours - just dessert and drinks take 20-30 mins to get there... Its like they opened the resort, but forgot to staff it. When we checked in, the air conditioning didnt work (this was fixed the same day), there was no iron in the room, and i had to call four times and then go in person to the front desk to get one, infact the operator had the audacity to argue for it!! Definitely not what i expect from a five star rated resort. The room service is quite unpredictable - its like there's a lottery for housekeeping and turn down service. First day we get no turn down, 2nd day we get both, and today we get NONE even after calling for it! Needless to say- this has not made us happy - these are minor things but when you pay good money for a five star rated resort, you expect the best. We have stayed at Sandals, excellence and Royal before, so we were comparing this to that, but we have been greatly disappointed. Maybe in a year they'll get their stuff together, but right now they are just undertstaffed and have no clue what they need to do with the basic services...

Needless to say, the staff is just learning how to work at a hotel. The biggest problem with this resort is the location. It is built lengthwise along a pretty grim looking slum with only a short wall separating the two. Add not a single sign of security and you have to question how this place is managed. And then there are the dogs. They bark nearly constantly from late afternoon through early morning. The front desk says there is nothing they can do as the dogs reside outside the property......merely steps away in the aforementioned slum.
