A bit hard to find, as there is nor real sign outside the building where you find the reception. If you enter the garden, which is closed by a big wooden door, you feel like you are in a dschungel in the middle of the town. We stayed in the Alux appartement which is a nice room with an kitchenette and a small balcony with hammock and view into the tropical garden. From the first minute, we felt like at home. The rooms are very clean, every second day it is cleaned an you receive new towels. You live in Playa but away from the tourist part in Avenida Quinta, if you enter this road, you feel to be in a total other world. For people, who don\u00b4t like to stay in an all inclusive hotel and who don\u00b4t need to have a direkt beach access, El Duende del Mar is the best place to stay in Playa. The owners are very friendly, they only speak spanish, but if you know a few words, it is easy and funny to communicate with signs ;-) The first day, we got the continetal breakfast which consists of toast, butter and jam. If you prefer to have a mexican breakfast, just tell them and you will get scambled eggs or omelette with beans and tacos. The breakfast is served at your desired time in your room! Thanks to the team of Duende del Mar for two fantastic weeks! We will come back ;-)", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cGood and clean hotel in PLaya del Carmen\u201d", "Author": "Misterbobz", "ReviewID": "UR56536584", "Content": "I stayed at El Duende del Mar for 3 nights. The hotel is a little hard to find since there is no sign announcing it. I had a very clean and spacious room and the garden is simply great. I was there only to sleep since I was diving all day! I had a hammock on my balcony and the environment is very relaxing. It's a simple no-fuss hotel but I liked it. I liked the fact that it is not in the crazyness of 5th avenue (10 min. walk). I think that Internet access is free, but ONLY if you have your own computer. (Many Internet caf\u00e9s nearby). Also, if you plan on cooking your own meals, the kitchen seems to be well-equiped. The hotel is cheap and you get what you pay for. The lady who showed me my room (and who seems to be the owner) only speaks Spanish. I really don't mind because I can also speak a little Spanish, and, let's face it, it's in Mexico, but I thought you should know. I'm really not demanding when it comes to that kind of simple family hotel, and I don't want to be overly negative, but I need to mention some less pleasant features. - There is absolutely no water pressure in the shower. I mean none!! - The hotel does not accept credit cards. Cash only. - Here's how it's configured: you enter through a locked door leading to the cool tropical garden. Then I had access to my room through a shared kitchen (shared by 2 rooms) (the bathroom is also shared by the 2 rooms). Also a locked door. It's ok so far... But the door of my room could not be locked. There was only a hook! I tend to trust people when I travel, but I am really not comfortable with the fact that someone in the other room could freely access mine. This is probably more disturbing for you ladies traveling alone (I need to add that Playa del Carmen is a VERY safe place!). - I was under the impression that breakfasts were included in the price. But they are not, and they are very expensive (for Mexico, that is). I had a glass of orange juice, a plate of fruit and a couple of toasts every morning, and I was totally shocked to see that they charged me 8 US$ every time.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDuende del Mar - Enchanting!\u201d", "Author": "lovetheyucatan", "ReviewID": "UR28791778", "Content": "My parents and I stayed at Duende del Mar from 3/29 - 4/4/09 and found it a very enchanting hotel.

We had a 2 bedroom suite and it was very spacious and included a kitchen/living room area on the 2nd floor with 2 enclosed balconies (one that overlooked their tranquil garden area).
