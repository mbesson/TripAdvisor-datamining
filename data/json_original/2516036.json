Lobby is a blast with bar serving yummy cocktails, plenty of seats, outdoor area with DJ and heat lamps. This place has a ton of nightlife so if you're into that you will be well situated. I stayed away from the nightclub upstairs but did enjoy the lobby. There's also free coffee at breakfast which is a nice plus. Rooms: I could live here. White modern furniture, low lacquer bed, lots of pillows and throws, chaise lounger. My room had a MASSIVE bathtub, which I used every day. Twice if possible. Sometimes hard to get the hot water going in the shower and no place to stash your toiletries except for a wee rolling cart. Counter space is definitely missed here. Robes and towels plentiful and plush. Food: I ate in the charming lobby restaurant, delish. I also ordered the room service Huevos Rancheros - amazing. Service: Fab, attentive, friendly, promptly brought toothpaste and earplugs on a weekend night when the partying below got loud. Free car service from the hotel was provided - a nice touch! Also nice were the bookmarks placed in reading material by room service :) Location: I could see the Hollywood sign from my room, across the street from the Frolic Room bar, reasonably close to Paramount Studios where I was working. Spa: Bliss. I love. Had a gifted body scrub treatment and enjoyed the heck out of the vichy/steam showers. Bought some wonderful products. (Big thanks for introducing me to Nuxe Huile Prodigeuse, which is my new favorite, and to the Bliss Body Cream as well.) Expensive but worth it. Wish the facility were bigger and had views but a perfectly comforting experience during a stressful trip! Overall, highly highly recommended.

All the staff we encountered were warm and friendly. They also seemed to really pay attention to detail and were constantly cleaning things ( even the room doors with Mr. Clean magic erasers). The lobby is also great (and a nice retreat from the outside tourist trap where this hotel lies). Many others have talked about noise being a problem but we didn't encounter this problem and nothing but radio silence from our room on the 10th floor. Pros: 1) Hotel is immaculate and all the staff are wonderful. 2) Rooms smell great and are of decent size. 3) Quick elevators. 4) Efficient and friendly check-in. 5) Literally the BEST hotel bed I've ever slept in (and that includes all the 5 star properties I've stayed in. It was so comfortable and the sheets were just perfect). 6) Trader Joe's is right around the corner so you can always grab some vino for the room on the cheap or a well-priced sandwich for bfast/lunch. 7) The gym is large and top notch. 8) Great water pressure and shower. Cons: 1) Valet is quite steep at $35.00/nt. My friend and I each had a car so our valet charges per night were $70.00 plus tax. With tips included, we spent a total of about $165 in total valet charges during our two night stay. 2) While it's the best W I've stayed in, the location really leaves something to be desired unless you just really want to stay in Hollywood or be on Ave. of the Stars. It's in a tourist crap trap area and you can't walk 10 feet down the street without someone asking you to take their bus/shuttle tour of LA. There were also lots of homeless hanging around the hotel. 3) While we didn't really care, some people wouldn't be comfortable with the bathroom set-up if traveling with friend(s) and/or family in the same room. There is a window - only about half of which is frosted - that looks into the shower/bathroom from the room.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maplewood, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cMiserable experience due to horrid nightclub crowd...\u201d", "Author": "hartss", "ReviewID": "UR128623241", "Content": "I am not the W Hollywood's typical demographic in that I am an adult who thinks and is considerate of my fellow human beings.

I stayed here due to Starwood loyalty and its location close to where I needed to be for work. I will not make that mistake again. I checked in on a Saturday afternoon in late April. The woman running the valet ($35 a night? Come on!) was harried, rude and a bad listener. Simply put, her attitude just sucked. Check-in took much longer than it should have - sweet women working at the desk, but I found them somewhat clueless. I will say that the concierge Zachary was terrific. He exudes positive energy and gave me some great restaurant suggestions and other LA tips. The room was actually nice. Great bed, beautiful bathroom. But at 2:00AM on both Saturday and Sunday nights I was awakened out of a deep sleep by the animals leaving the nightclub and/or lobby when they closed. I cannot believe I am the only one to whom this happened. I complained the second time and to the manager's credit they comped me more than a few SPG points, but I did not get back to sleep for hours. The loud and persistent sex noises coming from an adjoining room did not help matters much. He admitted to me that this is an ongoing problem at this hotel. The owner needs to make a decision - market it to grown-ups, or to the party kids, but NOT BOTH.

We were quite impressed that it was pointed out on the open top but tour though. We were only there for one night and having seen the surrounding area decided to eat at Delphines. The bar staff in the restaurant were lovely and we had quite a chat with them, they were willing to make cocktails not on the menu too. Food was of a high standard and reasonably priced. After dinner we sat on the patio with a drink, despite the fire pits it was still a bit chilly so returned inside where there was a band playing. There was a nice vibe and the singer was excellent.

The rooms were on the smaller side, but it was nicely decorated in a contemporary theme. Clean. The only thing I really didn't like was the pool. It was small with not many chairs around it. There were cabanas, but they're pricey to rent. Starting at something like $200 and up to in the $1000s. Definitely not kid friendly. Keep in mind in the summer months, the weekends are reserved for adult only parties at the pool, so the kids are definitely not allowed in then. The restaurant attached to the pool was very cool looking and trendy, but again, after a certain time, there is a hefty cover charge and the kids are not allowed in.

Their usual cute trick is to \"renovate\" old Holiday Inns (or whatever) into \"luxury properties\" but after staying at 3 now, I am convinced this is a scam to go low budget on cost and try to use \"hipness\" to sell crappy hotel rooms at astronomical prices. So, shame on me for being fooled, I guess. Apart from location, this property is a disaster. The rooms are dark and poorly constructed. Everything is thin and low-end feeling. White painted MBF furniture abounds, covered in white vinyl. A lot of it is chipped or stained and showing wear. The bed has a soft mattress with a hole in it, like sleeping in a hammock. Car parking is US$45 per day (on top of the $350!). There is NO pool (OK, they have one, but they have sublet it to a nightclub contractor, and guests cannot use it). For the four days we were there, the front door itself was actually broken, with a cutesy sign on it that said, \"I have issues\", (go around). For four days, you cannot fix the front door of your hotel? Really? They are understaffed, and what staff they have really couldn't care about guests at all. You have to give anyone $5 to get them to do anything. Their annoying refrain \"Whatever, whenever\" comes across more like, \"Yeah, whatever\".

In particular they always seem to have a big event going on, but guests are neither invited nor allowed. Problem is that when you rent out your common areas to \"exclusive\" events, where do you ask your guests to go relax? Seems they haven't thought that one through. The nightclub on the roof of the hotel isn't related to the hotel at all, they claim. You have no special privileges there (despite the $350 room charge).

Rooms: The rooms were designed in true W fashion with low beds and modern electronic comforts (e.g. iPod docking station and an \u201cany charge\u201d contraption). The key thing that I always worry about when staying at a W is if the room is functional. Surprisingly there was an ample amount of desk space to actually get work done. Food: There are several dining options around the property as it is in the heart of Hollywood Boulevard. However, I decided to dine at the W\u2019s Delphine, which was a solid selection, just right off the lobby. The French toast that was certainly nothing to write home about but filled my tummy nonetheless. If you\u2019re not interested in food, please don\u2019t pass up the opportunity to have a drink in the lobby living room and at least pretend you are an L.A. V.I.P. Bottom Line: All right, the W Hollywood is definitely a cool place to hang out and sleep if you are so inclined. I would not suggest this place for families with kids as it\u2019s not that type of hotel. This hotel is perfect for those visiting Los Angeles for the weekend who want to be close to the nightlife. With rates starting around $200, this hotel is a pretty good deal for what it offers (e.g. awesome location and posh L.A. scene). Other Tid Bits: -Got a car? Overnight valet parking is $35.00 -Trader Joe\u2019s is a couple of blocks from the hotel (good for getting booze or food) -Avoid this hotel on New Years Eve! There are always several parties at the hotel, and -although the hotel does an excellent job of trying to keep the peace (i.e. guest noise contracts and wristbands), not everything is foolproof -The rooftop pool is amazing, so bring your swimsuit -Drai\u2019s (one of L.A.\u2019s hottest clubs) is located on the rooftop of the W Hollywood Check out more reviews like these at MyHotelGuy.com Twitter: @MyHotelGuy", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cChic hotel\u201d", "Author": "kenuga", "ReviewID": "UR125916122", "Content": "2 days here as my family began spring break trip in la area.

I didn't find any of these common themes to be accurate- that isn't to say the people who posted those comments are wrong, it is to say that it is apparent that the W Hollywood is trying to change their market.

First off, I've never spent so much money to be treated as horribly as I was this week. The thing that stuck in my mind through most of the trip here was the fact that I never felt welcome, at all. When my vacation here began, the lady who checked me in was Marisol. She was reliable and smart and I enjoyed when she helped me. The deposit, was 500 dollars which is way more than any other hotel I've been to in LA. Wheels, is HORRIBLE! Do not park here at the W, if you can help it. LAZ parking owns wheels, and all of their employees are disrespectful and unwashed. They will leave your car smelling like a hollywood hippie. Charge you for leaving your car overnight, even if you never parked it there overnight. Seriously, a truly unprofessional company, that is not owned by the W, and why they would have such riff raff, trash the nice people's personal property is beyond me. They act like they have a monopoly, becasue they basically do. I was overcharged, again and again by these ridiculous fools. Definitely put a sour taste in my mouth for the whole trip. No one in the Hotel takes any responsibility, they will only tell you, \"our valet service, isn't part of our company\" When we checked out, they actually made us wait over an hour to have someone go and \"inspect\" our room? Seriously? Places infinitely better, don't act this ridiculous. So aside from being a complete waste of money, I was also called a very nasty derogatory comment, by one of the Wheels employees who thought that he could argue my rationality by telling me something so rude, that it caused me to basically start shouting uncontrollably. I was over charged over 150 dollars, and I never parked my car there for more than a few hours. I think if Marisol, had been around, I would gotten all of my charges reversed. But I unfortunately had the ill-pleasure of Maureen, being my receptionist. This front desk personal, is another winner. It seems that they have the absolute most terrible employees, working during checkout. Maureen, not only took from 12:30 to past 1:30 just to check us out. She didn't help us reverse any overcharged the hotel made... like charging us for a phone call to the hotels reservation desk. (another 2 bucks) Easy stuff like that was beyond here reach. I swear it looks like they take all of the unemployed morons in hollywood, that can't seem to competently make it in the entertainment industry and turn them loose on the \"more successful\" entertainers for the horror of their own benefit. When you get a room here, you are not guaranteed any sort of passes for entrance into Drai's. Drai's isn't more than just a pool, during the day. They were remodeling, and the place was a mess. The pool was open, but there was a film on top of the water from the construction. Nothing I like more than having my nephews swim in a swirl of muck. I love staying in hotels in Hollywood. But this is the easily the worst experience I've ever had staying in this part of California.

I asked him if W Hollywood upgraded platinum guests. Boy do they. He emailed me back immediately and advised that pending availability, of course, I was would be in a suite. Kudos to him. My room was ridiculous. A semi-circle couch with privacy curtain is in the center of the room. Definitely had an entertaining vibe to it. Bathroom had a huge tub and tile shower. Tons of cool lighting sets the mood. The bed was a very comfortable king. Upon checkin I was slightly skeptical of how much I'd be able to sleep since I was given a list of rules regarding excessive noise and guests in each room. The lobby was heating up when I checked in around 4:30pm. I had no issues with noise. Slept like a baby. Very quiet. I had to leave around 4:30 the next morning for my flight. As I was checking out, the late night nose-candy crowd was just checking in. Entertaining. Hotel security was quick to tell the young lad strumming his guitar in the lobby (at 4:30am) to give it a rest. W Hollywood has a train station/light rail (whatever LA calls their transit rail) immediately below the hotel. Convenient. Not convenient if you need to get to the airport since there are no train stations at LAX or Burbank. Cab to Burbank Airport (at 5am, with no traffic) was around $30. Awesome hotel. The Hollywood stars are immediately in front of the hotel. Great location. Will definitely stay here again. Upon pulling in to the valet lot I advised the attendant that I was only checking in then immediately leaving. He told me he'd keep it close at no charge. When I went back to get my car 20 mins later, I was directed to the cashier and paid $15, I think. Slightly irritating. The wetbar counter had lots of damage from guests not taking care of the room.

I found all I had to do is ask, they don't anticipate but do respond extremely well to requests. The manager on duty was kind enough to escort me up to the roof so I could take some pictures of the LA skyline, mountains, and Hollywood sign since the roof was closed due to filming and it was first day the sun had come out of my visit.

Hollywood glam Lobby is a great place for a cocktail and people watching. Definetly a gathering place for a hip crowd. Outside bar and patio have a great ambiance especially the evening. Something to note, as a personal preference. The outside lounge has great music, but very difficult to carry on a conversation. Oddly, there was guy trying to play a saxophone to the music. Kind of disturbing. Not sure if his presence was intentional or not. Room: Higher floors need access via the elevator. We were on the second floor where all access was available.

A comfortable bed, beautiful crisp decorations, and nice bathroom - along with great amenities. The location of the hotel is great for Graumans, the Hollywood Farmers Market, Katsuya, and other attractions on and around Hollywood Blvd. We were able to walk each morning, and even spotted a few celebraties near the hotel. For further distances (up to 5 miles) the Acura experience is certainly worth trying, and a great way to save a cab fare. As far as the nose compliant, we never had any trouble with it (though we are still in our 20s so we enjoy a good bar). In fact, we spent one night drinking downstairs at the Living Room and really enjoyed the feel, not to mention the fact that we were only an elevator ride to our room. Finally, and most importantly, the staff at the hotel goes above and beyond, In all of my travels I have never met so many nice people, willing to go out of their way to insure you have a wonderful vacation, especially Jim.

I found it quite unnerving to be surrounded by items for sale in my room and had to be so careful not to open anything accidentally or it would be charged to my debit card and believe me, the prices were astronomical i.e. $9 for a bottle of water... WATER!!!! Not sure how closely Delphine is affiliated with the hotel itself but it seemed to be the same company... anyway, we had our first meal there and decided never to return. VERY expensive, food poor, service ok but not worth the prices. Our bill came to $110 and i didn't even have a starter and only one drink!!! My advice re eating? Drive to Mels Diner on Sunset, open 24/7 and the prices are amazing, food spot-on and service is the best. Anyway - hotel charge $5.95 for 15 minutes use of internet and $0.50 per printed black&white a4 sheet of paper... Disgusting!!!! So it cost me nearly $10 just to print our bording passes off to fly home. The room was nice, bathroom lovely and great shower but i found bed a bit hard. Apart from that though, room was great. Valet parking is $25 overnight with in/out which is pretty good but car park opposite charges $20 for 24 hours with in/out and is secure. There is a constant line of taxis that park alongside the car park at night so you can rest assured no damage will come to your car. Nice big TV in room with dvd player which was great. If you want to go to the pool on the roof, you can use it even though it is a different company to the hotel but beware, they will try to get you to buy food/drinks which are soooo expensive i.e. cocktails are $17 each, average bottle of spirit is around $500 EACH!!!! We sunbathed and used the pool for a couple of hours but felt uncomfortable not buying anything when we kept being asked. I think the hotel need to make it quite clear that the pool is nothing to do with them instead of using it as a huge selling point on website etc. Also the hotel seemed to be filled with people who have absolutely no consideration for other guests when returning to their rooms in the early hours of the morning because we were woken several times most nights!!!

A couple of cocktails in room and back down to meet Chris N and go to Drai's. Past super long X games weekend lines to front and up elevator to the club. Drai's is separate from the W so no promises to get into club disclosed up front but Chris worked his magic and for a 1 bottle service fee we had the prime poolside canopy daybed by the door of the club. Yes it cost about $500 for bottle after tax/tip but no cover for 8 of us and we got a bottle of booze and a place to chill so totally worth it. Pro waitress was pro, friendly and unhollywood. Diverse and friendly crowd. Wifey got a pic with one of the actors from Glee? OK. Next morning breakfast at Delphine. Maybe best breakfast I've had - scramble in puff pastry. Again, pro waitress.

Lets start with the upsides: It is a new and chic hotel in the center of Hollywood. Location is just perfect. Surrounded with many sightseeing points, nice bars and restaurants and many more. It is on the Hollywod boulevard, what else would you want?:) Fabulous king rooms are big enough for 2 people. Everything is brand new in the room, bed is super comfy, bathroom is equipped well with everything you need, electronic stuff is cool and fun. Downsides: Dont expect to see any nice, smiling or helpful staff. Every time you ask questions about anything they seem like you are bothering them or your question is too silly to ask. Especially reception staff! We stayed for 3 days and maybe we got the chance to see them all but they are all same. Shame for the name of W. There are 2 nightclubs in the hotel. One in the entrance area and one in the rooftop. These 2 clubs are always active and crowded in the evening and at night. Especially because of the one in the entrance area; reception, elevators, sitting area etc are always crowded. You see kids and adults (strange mix of people) wandering around with drinks in hand. Some of them drunk and speaking loudly or bothering you in the elevator while transfering to the roof bar from the down bar. Some of these party people are also staying at the hotel for a night and if they are staying next to your room, you are in trouble. There are no rules or regulations at the hotel to put all of these in order. Unfortunately it seemed to us that customers who come to nightclubs and spend a couple of hours in this hotel are more valuable than the customers who actually stay in this hotel and pay much more than the party animals. Dont even think about touching the drinking water in the room. It is 9 dollars. All extras are too expensive. Buy your own stuff from the supermarkets around and keep your money to yourself. Noise of the music from the clubs will always come to your room. Be prepared for that. If you are sensitive, you wont be able to sleep easily after a long day of discovering the city. I kept the most shocking thing to the end. When we entered the room, we found a post it on the LA guide book written by the previous guest saying: \"Dont let your 200 dollars to puff in the air!!\" How is that? :) If i go to LA again, i wont be staying in W for sure.

We had heard the W was THEE place to stay in Hollywood. We were also told the service could be very snotty but decided to book there anyways. Thankfully all the employees we encountered were very friendly and happy to give suggestions on where to go etc. (Anthony, our bell captain who helped us with loads of luggage was especially welcoming). Our room was small and despite being on the 11th floor the view wasn't good, it overlooked a rooftop. For $300+ a night I guess I was expecting a little more from the room. It was very stark, cramped and typical (although the beds were wonderful). Anyways, after checking in we were excited to put on our suits and head up to the pool. But, then found out they were charging $20 per person cover charge to use the pool, yes, even for hotel guests. That's just crazy and had we known ahead of time we probably would have booked elsewhere. There was also no lounges available so our visions of lounging poolside, reading magazines and drinking girly cocktails were crushed and we just headed out to explore instead. Parking at the hotel is $35 (plus tax) and maybe that's the going rate for Hollywood but it seemed like the hotel was trying to nickel and dime every chance it got (even a charge for wi-fi). That night the lobby bar was going strong and had an amazing jazz group playing. They were cabaret style and super fun. We checked out the following morning and headed to the beach where we could actually catch some rays. So long story short, If you're ever in Hollywood on a Sunday night I highly recommend you head to the W for the jazz performance. But if lounging by the pool is part of your plans you may want to stay elsewhere. P.S.

We got a great deal on price, but having stayed in hotels of this (apparent) standard before, we had certain expectations. Many of these were not met, so here's a summary of them. Location: a hotel of this standard would be expected to be in a nice location. Don't be misled, the W is not in the cleaner, nicer West Hollywood area, but in the run down area of Hollywood Blvd, about a mile from the main Hollywood bustle. If you're into smoke shops, 'adult' shops and tattoo parlors, this is for you. If not, you may not (like us) enjoy the area so much. Surprising therefore that a 'designer' hotel would be located in this part of the city...in fact, we did not like the atmosphere outside of the hotel complex after dark. The hotel complex: nice restaurants and bar areas (if you're happy to pay $15 upwards for a drink) but full of wannabe types and those who reckon it looks good to be seen in this place. We were unimpressed by this. Compared to hotels such as the Gamercy Park in New York this one seemed to try too hard to be something it wasn't. Rooms: nice room, not massive, but had a nice look and feel, retro-futuristic design. We really liked the room. We had a courtyard view, which was nicer than the view onto a parking lot or the rather run down hollywood and vine area. Also this aspect meant it was quiet at night,so we got good sleep. Cleanliness: we couldn't honestly say whether our room was actually serviced or not. If it was, it was certainly a rushed job! Overall, nice rooms, wrong location, a hotel which attracts wanabe A-listers, but tries too hard to be something the location won't allow it to be. A good 3-star hotel at best, with some good price deals at the moment.

The hotel lobby is fantastic, but the room corridors were slightly dull - you can tell this was an older property that was redone. But once you enter the room it was a nice change. Plentiful closet space. Two king platform beds - very comfortable - not sure if there were Westin Heavenly beds, but close enough. The desk had all the amenities for charging your various devices (didn't have to pull out any iPod or BB chargers). Large screen TV and nice cushioned platform sitting area by window - nice touches. Bathroom was not large but nothing to complain about. Concierge helpful in finding and suggesting various meal options including where the \"celebs\" go - that was important to some in my party (no, we didn't see anyone). Kitchen24 is a good breakfast option - 7 min walking distance. Next day was at \"The Griddle\" where celebs go - we made reservations and the place was packed - got the back room. But by the time we were done, there was a line of 50-60 people waiting outside. So must be a \"got-to-go\" place if in LA. For dinner we walked about 10-15 mins on Hollywood Blvd to Palm Thai - strange feeling when you enter - family style seating (long tables) and a singing Elvis, but the food was fantastic - must go. This is also walking distance (but a good 10-15 min walk on the other side of Palm Thai) to the \"happening\" area of Hollywood Blvd with the Chinese and Kodak Theatres. The stars walk is also there right outside the hotel on both sides of the street, so you're not missing out on that.

To their credit, colleagues on 2 other floors had loud partiers in their hallways - and within a few minutes of calling the front desk to complain, those noise issues were corrected. The neighborhood definitely leaves something to be desired. It's pretty much a mix of stripper clothiers, tourist shops, tattoo parlors and a Trader Joes. The hotel itself is amazing, however. Morning and afternoons are lovely, quiet and mellow. In the evening it turns into a hot spot packed with hipsters looking to see and be seen. The Bliss Spa on the 4th floor is delightful. The restaurant on the roof has a great view, but beware the dresscode by the pool. This is definitely not a kid-friendly hotel, which was fine with us. Certainly not the place to bring the family if you're doing the California Disney circuit. Also, you will probably not feel comfortable schlepping around the W in shorts and a t-shirt.

I was instantly impressed with the lobby, as it was decorated in deep red colors with glitzy crystal chandeliers. The service was excellent (as their motto, \"W hotel, Whatever, Whenever!\" implies), and the staff was more than helpful. The room was nice, and the decor was modern-retro. There was a comfortable window bench with an amazing view of Hollywood. There are numerous delicious restaurants nearby and most of them epitomize Los Angeles (as an LA native, I can attest to this). The location is central, and if you are looking for a home base hotel with easy access to other places in LA this is a great choice. However, I had a slight problem with the bathrooms, as the privacy left something to be desired. The bathroom walls don't really do much, so you can hear everything in the bathroom even with the doors closed, and vice-versa. The shower is visible from the room and is only covered by frosted glass. There is a 2 foot opening at the bottom of the shower that needless to say left me a little unsettled (can you imagine reaching for the soap and accidentally showing off a little too much?) I think the design would have been nice had I been traveling with a significant other, but with friends I would have preferred a more conservative bathroom. The club on the roof of the hotel (Drais) is awesome, classy and interesting and I would definitely frequent it again. It is a destination to many more than hotel guests, and often times people stay in the hotel just to go to Drais.

I arrived at the hotel very early after a trans-Pacific flight and was greeted with a warm smile and welcome by Matt who immediately asked my name and introduced himself. I then met Abby at the reception who was also very friendly and welcoming. Due to the early time of my arrival, I had purposely planned to spend my morning at the Bliss Spa and unexpectedly and to my surprise, Abby was able to check me in. Upon entering my room, I was impressed by the design, all the amenities, the well thought out technology elements in the room and the apparent care of the housekeeping staff as my accommodations were immaculately taken care of as well as all the common areas of the hotel. I then went on to the Bliss Spa where I treated myself to a Blissage 75 by the most intuitive therapist I have ever had. His name is Moe, he possibly the best massage I've ever had so get ready to be taken to Nirvana and back under his skillful care. Since I had just spent five and a half hours on an airplane, an Oxygen Blast was in order. The aesthetician was also extremely friendly, unfortunately I can't remember her name. My experience here was so absolutely fantastic that I decided to take a short break to meet with friends and then returned to Bliss for a great manicure and pedicure by Lisa. During my break between treatments and while meeting with friends in the very glamorous living room where an impressive chandelier drapes from the very tall ceiling flowing like an Academy Awards gown over a beautiful red staircase that brings you back to the nostalgia of Old Hollywood I decided a noon cocktail was in order. Now, don't let the \"Old Hollywood\" comment foul you, the space is very eclectic and chic with very rich leather furniture, elements of chrome and marble that all flows beautifully. The service at the bar was wonderful and attentive as well, the cocktail list impressive though I chose to have one of the best Cosmopolitan's I've ever tasted....made to perfection. The pool area, seductive and relaxing and at night full of energy. I read someone say the place was full of \"Hollywood wannabe's\".....well, I'd like to say that everyone I encountered was fun, friendly and just being no more than themselves while having a great time with friends or a loved one. It is also obvious that many people come to this hotel for business and I would attribute that to destination and great service. Upon my departure, the experience was as flawless as the arrival. Abby also checked me out, she acknowledged me from the moment she saw me from a distance and greeted me again as I approached the desk. No name asked, no room number asked. She knew who I was and addressed me by name, just like Matt at the front the numerous times he saw me. As far as everyone else, even if they don't know your name you will see that you will be acknowledged with a greeting every time. Thank you for a fantastic time!

It was just OK. The rooms are very very stark and minimalist. I absolutely love modern, minimalist design - but this hotel has done it very poorly. It feels cold and clinical - much like you are in an insane asylum! There is no artwork on the walls and very little color - it's all white basically. The bed in very low and there are a lot of fluorescent lighting (just to make it seem even colder). The shower had the worst pressure I've ever experienced - it was just better than a dribble! Was such a let down as the shower head looked so big and luxurious. The toilet blocked a few times and we had to call for maintenance to unclog it. The maintenance Service was prompt and followed by a courtesy call to see if everything was OK - a nice touch. The airconitioning was the loudest, most annoying system you'll ever hear - it stopped and started throughout the night with a big clunk and rattling sound like an old, noisy refrigerator. We ended up turning it off over night as it kept us awake! Whilst LA is very spread out, and its hard to find a good location for everything, the location of the hotel is terrible. It's sleazy and dirty. I felt a little unsafe at night. There's very little around in terms of shopping and eating - it is however, very conveniently located above Hollywood & Vine underground railway which you can take to Hollywood & Highland, for instance, where there is plenty more choice. The area looks to be improving though. I guess in 10 years it will be OK! For a good location - the Sofitel much better. I also didn't like that the pool was shared by Drais nightclub. Whilst a very funky looking area and a great night spot, it seemed like the pool wasn't part of the hotel. I didn't want to use it as it wasn't private enough (that's just me - there were people laid beside it). It's not all bad though. The service was exceptional - very warm and friendly and personal. We never had any issues with service in any way, but we never do at W properties. The Bliss products used in the rooms are very good, and there are like 6 different products they give you each day which is great. We also loved the special multiple-charger station which had about 10 different connections to charge your phone or camera etc and the iPod dock beside the bed (seems to be standard at most hotels these days). Overall I wouldnt stay again - it just didnt seem homely like some hotels are. I did like the party feel of the hotel - it's basically a nightclub not a hotel but it just wasn't wow-ing enough for me.

This is a very hip, modern hotel--great for young couples or singles, NOT families! Hollywood has become a nightlife hot-spot, and lots of locals go to the W Hollywood for the clubs (Drai's, the pool, the outdoor Hollywood Station lounge, the Living Room lobby) and to eat at Delphine.

LA also has the largest population of homeless in the USA (well, where would you live if you had no home?), which is something beyond the hotel's control.

We left briefly to look for somewhere to eat outside of the hotel, found nothing, and were greeted by homeless men sleeping literally outside the hotel gates upon our return. The room was everything we expect when we stay at a W, and we were happy with all of the amenities. However, we were not aware that the pool was part of the club and would be unavailable after 6pm. We tried to visit the pool area during the afternoon, but there was a photo shoot in progress with equipment and wires everywhere, so not a safe place for our toddler to be running around. We were traveling with an infant and a toddler, so we couldn't take advantage of the free car rides (no car seats), couldn't walk anywhere, and couldn't use the pool in the evening, so it felt like we were stuck in our room. We did try sitting in the living room area after dinner, but it got too noisy/crowded for the kids. Also, when we were checking out, an employee told us that it was a good idea since the hotel gets pretty crazy and very loud on the weekends. I wish someone would have warned us of that when we were checking in for a weekend stay with our kids. The staff was very friendly and ooo-ed and awww-ed over our boys every time we passed through the lobby, and they did offer restaurant vouchers and some points back for our trouble, but it took a lot of time away from our vacation to re-work our itinerary, deal with SPG, and pack up and move to a different hotel.

I travel for work and I am a SPG Platinum member. I have stayed at W's all over the US and this is the worst. First one thing to get out of the way. This hotel is located in one of the worst areas in Hollywood. DO NOT WALK AROUND AT NIGHT. Its very run down and crime ridden. Ok, I checked in and was upgraded to what I was told was the best suite in the hotel, room 1101. Great, so I had to wait for the room to be ready, but it was fine and got all checked in. The room itself was huge and pretty cool. Very modern interior and nice ammenities. Had excellent views of LA and the bathroom was big with a tub in the middle of the room. All great. I settled in and did some work, there is free internet if you are a platinum member, and its very fast (not common of any hotel). So from here on out, it went down hill. The room is not very insulated. You can hear the outside traffic and street noise. I was down on the end of the hall, but could still hear people outside walking around. I took a shower and there was no water pressure what so ever. I am use to it, but something that should be addressed. I went to bed at around 10:45pm. At around 11:00pm I heard some huge thumping and super loud music. I thought it was a car outside, but it would not stop. I finally realized that it was coming from upstairs. It was so loud that I could barely think. It just got ouder and louder. The bass was so bad that the glass and furniture in the room were rattling. I called down and was told that there was a club, literely above my head, and it goes to 3am. Its called Drais?? The girl was nice enough to offer my earplugs, but that was she could not do anything. I told her, BS, and spoke to someone else. They were confused and thought I new about this club and the noise. I had to tell them that I had no clue and was here for business, not clubbing, and needed to sleep. They finally agreed to move me to the 10th floor. So I packed my stuff and moved. I got to the floor and I was amazed. It was just a normal room, but it was still SUPER loud. Not as bad as the 11th floor, but still loud. I called again and told that I had to come the lobby. I get to the lobby and it was super loud there too. They have a lobby bar and it was crazy. I had to yell to the manager about my problem. They finally gave me a room on the 5th floor. It now way past midnight and I got my new key and headed back. I was then stopped by security and asked me where I was going? I told him to my room. He told me wait as there was too many people around trying to get upstairs?? I was blown away. I said I was guest and just wanted to go to my room. He stated \"too bad\". I then said I would just get a manager, then he said, OK, go ahead. WTF?? I checked out that next morning and was given points from my troubles.. Points dont cut it here. This club had runied what could have been a nice hotel. If you are 21 and looking to party, this is the spot for you. If you are a business traveler, SPG member, or looking for a quite weekend, avoid this place, its not worth it.

Throw in celebrity guests and a live band in the lobby and you've got the W Hollywood. I had a chance to stay here for 4 days and was impressed by the vibe and attitude of the place. It's very new and is breaking new ground in a once-seedy section of Hollywood. There's still the old-school walk of fame sidewalk and dive bars (the iconic Frolic Room across the street) nearby but the newly-built W condos and soon to be built luxury project across the street promise a definite upgrade for the neighborhood. TIP: Book this hotel through a wesite called Magellan Travel and save hundreds. We stayed here for $170 a night, at least a $100 off the rack rate. Speaking of upgrades, I was upgraded to a suite (I'm SPG Platinum) that was maybe the largest that I have ever stayed in. It featured an all white, 60s retro cool look with a circular couch, a mid-room curtain and electric shades. The all marble bathroom was larger than 2 normal hotel baths. Very impressive but I was annoyed by the bottles of booze, snacks, water, clothes, etc. with price tags on them scattered about. SPG- stop trying to sell me stuff. The lobby is spectacular, with high ceilings, a sweeping staircase and a bar scene that was lively. We were there during a Sunday night jazz promotion where the lobby was turned into a club-like scene and there was a glitzy turn out by the guests and locals. The disco on the top floor is apparently a hot spot, as there was a line of the young and the beautiful waiting behind the velvet ropes for the elevator to the club every night. TIP: Avoid any of the top floors near the disco if you want a quiet room. One night, the manager had a Gold/Platinum reception at the lobby bar, which are usually lame, but this was an open bar and a nice touch. The manger and his assistant were chatty and nice guys to talk to. Upon checking out, I had some problems with items on my bill that I had to argue with the clerk about (free movies that I was charged for, internet access on more than one laptop in my room, etc.) and it took a few calls to SPG and the hotel accounting department to get them deducted.

I was on the fourth floor facing the parking lot and all night, I could hear the cab drivers talking and laughing. You can hear every word a person said while walking down the hall, no matter how soft they spoke. The room was very nice but I must complain about the shower and the overall lighting of the room. I'm sure the reason why they opted for a frosted glass panel in the bathroom is to allow for more light to enter the bathroom but if you have someone sharing your room, they will certainly wake up from the light shining through the shower. I'm sure they could put a shade or something in there to avoid this. Also, the bathrooms really don't provide that much privacy, you can hear everything going on in there too. Overall the hotel is just loud. Another disappointment is the mood lighting. My room was soooo dark, even with all the lights turned on it was just dim. I called it mood lighting but when your putting on make up or just want to get a good view of your outfit, that dim lighting simply makes it difficult.

I liked the restaurant in the hotel called Delfina or something like that. The breakfast was good. When you stay in a nice hotel you know that the food and anemiites aren't going to be \"cheap\" so I found the restaurant food very good. We had a lovely brunch and because it was lunch time, the hotel had a \"card\" for a dessert which the host gave me and it was fabulous. Having the SPG card is great when you stay at the Starwood property because we received a gift of 2 small bottles of fiji water a day which was nice. There was coffee in the morning also complimentary. Though we didn't use it, there was a 1 time car service with Acura or something like that. Quite nice. The area isn't what I had hoped but then again, I never stayed in Hollywood. We did walk around but mainly LA is a driving town. If you do drive, the car valet is almost $40 a day which is typical but to me that's like 2 nice cocktails so for 5 nights, the $200 not including all the tips was as bit of a sole point but that is typical and I only wish there was a self park option but we were told there was not. The roof top pool is awesome. Even though it was December we did lay out. We were there was one lovely couple and it felt like we owned the world. The design looks like something you would see in the TV show Entourage....all cool. I do have photos but I don't have time to post but it really is a nicely designed space. One strange thing I noticed...we don't get our shampoo or soap replaced. I think its all part of the green movement but it's so embarrassing to call the front desk to request soap, shampoo, etc. I wish they would just give it to you.

On the positive, the staff attitude and helpfulness was outstanding. The only shortcoming is not enough front desk staff and long long waits to check in or get service or even ask a question. The rooms were very stylish, yet comfortable and spotlessly clean, but I do miss having a soaking tub. Handy to have all the chargers and outlets on the desk, so you don't have to fumble through your bag to pull yours out. On the negative, there are no coffeemakers in the room, so to just get coffee ($8) on the menu was $17 after taxes, service charges and tip and $9 for in room water. I went to Trader Joes around the back of the hotel and stocked up for breakfast rather than overpay. The parking was $38/day with no discounts for guests. I pay less in Manhattan. Also, the pool area did not have a single lounge chair for sunning, but lots of cabanas, for which I am sure they charge for rental. Also, internet was $15/day, which is excessive, especially for US hotels.I would stay again, but bring my own food supplies, since even though I am on an expense account, I hate to feel that I am being ripped off just because they can. I was on the upper floors and could hear the disco at night, but I turned the Heat/AC fan to high and that helped drown the sound out. With all the velvet ropes and focus on the scene, it has a bit of an aura of exclusivity that I found off-putting. The bar was very pricy and hard to get a seat.

Having read the previous reviews about the hotel having a fun vibe at weekends I contacted the hotel direct and requested rooms on a quiet floor. This request was not a problem and there was a lovely touch left in my room (thanks Jim!) which shows that customer care is paramount to the running of this hotel. From check in to check out the staff were nothing but friendly, courteous and helpful. The rooms were fabulous and the bed luxurious. The lights could be adjusted and dimmed to suit your mood accordingly. The quality and cleaning of the room couldn't have been better. The weather wasn't the best during our stay but we did pop up to the pool to take a look and I can imagine it on a lovely sunny day. I'm not the right age group to go to a club so I gave it a miss, but judging from the beautiful people in the lobby of the hotel on a weekend night I imagine it to be the place to go and be seen. Other reviews have mentioned the area where the hotel is. There is a metro station just outside and as far as I'm concerned it was a godsend as we relied on public transport to get back and forth from the airport (Flyaway bus to Union Station and red line metro direct to the hotel). Yes, there were a few homeless people there at night but they did not cause any problems or make us feel at any risk. It is at the end of Hollywood Blvd and there are some cheap underwear shops there, but there are equally as many fast food places and bars so you have to put it into perspective. It's only a short walk to Hollywood Highlands (or one metro stop) where you'll find plenty of places to eat, drink and better shop.

Within a few hours I had 2 phone calls and 3 emails offering me assistance with my needs and all were met making my friends b-day a night to remember. My flight from NYC to LA was delayed which caused my reservation time at Boa to pass, I had called Boa directly and was informed that their were no other reservations available. When I checked in at the W the front desk asked if I needed anything, I explained my situation with Boa and asked if they could recommend another restaraunt, one phone call later by the conceirge, a new reservation was available for me at Boa. The security at the hotel was top notch checking room keys for those coming and going late night, bartenders made well poured drinks - especially for the price. The rooms were slightly over average size, and quite large by NYC standards. A great place for people watching, partying, or just lounging around. They've got a great fitness center and pool area (although no swimming was had due to the weather). The price was pretty reasonable, i booked on line for a package that included overnight parking and 2 drinks (parking is $30/night+, drinks are easily $14+/each) for about $240/night.

The W Hollywood is a beautifully designed hotel with spacious, modern rooms. The clientelle tends to be primarily in their 20's and 30's (with a lot of money to spend it seems as this is not an inexpensive hotel). The hotel's Drai nightclub is a major draw and there lies the problem in trying to get a good night's sleep. Nightly at about 3 AM when the club closes you'll either be hearing the ruckus outside the hotel or in the hallway outside your room from those who had one too many drinks. We had to call security on more than one occasion during our stay. I'd suggest bringing heavy duty earplugs if sleep is important to you during your stay. That being said we did find the staff very courteous and extremely helpful especially those that worked the concierge desk. We appreciated the use of a nicely equipped gym but the rooftop swimming pool is more of a \"set design piece\" than a pool you can actually use. To enjoy your first cup of coffee of the day one needs to make the trek down to the lobby to get it as the rooms are not equipped with coffee machines. We did eventually ask for a coffee maker for the room and they were nice enough to provide one but they had to be reminded daily to provide the coffee for it. The location of the hotel was convenient for our purposes but the neighbourhood as such left a lot to be desired (unless you're looking for a tattoo parlour that is, there are lots of them in the area). So would I recommend this hotel? yes and no. It all depends on what you're looking for. It's a beautiful hotel, no doubt about it, with a well trained, courteous staff but the neighbourhood is not the best nor are your chances of getting a good night's sleep.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWOW\u201d", "Author": "Jina72", "ReviewID": "UR87402288", "Content": "Jim McPartlin, the GM has a great team there and everyone was fantastic right from the beginning to the end.

But sadly until about 1am the room next door was playing thumping music and girls were screaming - I was actually really concerned that our room backed onto the club (as I heard they had a night club), I went out into the hall to investigate and no, it was all coming from a room next door. I could hear the lyrcis to each song they were playing through my ear plugs it was that loud. The next night those guests must have left but then we heard the music from the club/bar. no sleep again. I wanted to cry, we were out sightseeing all day and just wanted a decent nights sleep but did not get one during our stay. We did not venture to the rooftop pool or the club as once we saw the type of people that were going in, we felt we were not 'glam' enough and had heard stories from other guests that they had to wait at the rope just to get back into the hotel. it was all a bit pretencious with the red rope and loads of glammed up people despearatly trying to get into the club/pool- we left them to it. Location-wise, no really the best, depends what you want to see. We would stay over in West Hollywood next time or at the Beach.

On the way (20 min walk) we saw one guy get arrseted, a police helicopter swooping over, the shops literally were all smoke shops, tour shop, sex shops and so on.....we did not walk back at night but got the subway as we did not really feel that safe. Servcie from the hotel - well non existant for us.We had a call on our last night from the conceirge/whatever, whenever guy asking if there was anything we needed? Was a bit late as we were checking out in the morning. On check out I knew we had not spent a penny at the hotel (would you buy a small bottle of water for $10?). The lady on the desk gave me a piece of paper with 'amount to be charged - 0' and said 'all good to go'. I thought that was it, no charge as I had pre-paid the room. Got in taxi and checked again, I had been charged $188 for Spa treatments I had never had! I had to phone the hotel 6 times and no one ever called me back apart from after 6 calls, a lovely lady from their finance dept. Guy on the desk was poor, Spa employees were poor, everytime someone took my number and said they would get back to me but never did. One guy on the desk even gave me the Spa's number but when I rang it was for Madam ussauds in Hollywood? I finally got my money back onto credit card a week later but am not lumbered with \u00a335 worth of mobile phone charges. Wrote to the hotel over a week ago to compalin about the whole thing and my bill but surprisingly, no reply. If you have tons of money and money is no object then stay here and they will most probably give you great service.

Yes we could hear the nightclub most nights and the pool party on a Sunday afternoon was quite loud but we knew it was going to be like this before we went. It never kept us awake anyway! It is a party hotel so if you want to come for a family holiday, it\u2019s probably not the place for you. We parked the car at the W Hotel parking lots on the first night and after that we just used the parking lot at the back of the hotel as it was half the price and just as secure (we could see it from the room)! It was only when we got home did we realise that the W had billed our card for the whole trip even though we told them on check out that we hadn\u2019t used the valet parking. They apologised immediately and refunded the charge so that was easily rectified. It\u2019s in a good location for the Hollywood sights and we could just see the Hollywood Sign if we squashed our noses to the window! Its about a 15 minute stroll to the Chinese Theatre.

The Euro white leather circular couch in the center of the suite is mind blowing! The Marvelous Suite is a little less money but is still one of the finest suite rooms I have ever stayed in.

However, the link of this hotel with Drai's is what makes this place so overrated. Mainly, the racket of Drai's kind of makes this place less chill to stay at and seems to bring in a particularly Chachi clientele. There were lines to get into the pool, club, and even the lobby at night. We had drinks in the lobby one night, where friends who live in LA waited in line to have a cocktail with us in the lobby. We attempted to go to the outside space of the lobby once they got through the first line only to find another velvet rope and line to get to the outside part of the lobby, and even found a line that we had to wait in when we tried to leave. We had to wait for someone to open the velvet rope to leave! My friends and I immediately left and went to a more chill bar in Hollywood. (I used to live in LA, and my friends and I are late 20's/early 30's, so it's not like we were looking for some kind of Senior Center or something.) The pool and nightclub were the same scene. Now, if the scene once you were through all of the lines was awesome, I wouldn't have a problem with it, but once we were through all of the lines, we were like, \"This is it?\" The whole overrated racket of Drai's kind of made our stay at the hotel less relaxing.

I stayed here being an SPG Gold member so wanted to check out this new hotel. The hotel lobby has a \"hip\" ambiance - high ceilings, spacious, clean, and trendy decor. If you want to be in the thick of the Hollywood party scene - stay here. If you are actually looking to get some rest or sleep, you may want to look elsewhere to stay. I arrived on Sunday evening expecting the scene to be a bit mellow. What was I thinking, right? The place was hopping and looked like a pool party had been going on for hours. It was filled with the young 20 something Hollywood wannabe types. It's definitely a place to see and be seen - nothing more. The check-in process was average. Don't get me wrong, the staff was friendly but the line was filled with drunken fraternity type boys who were cutting in line with the staff completely ignoring their behavior. The rooms were nice (though a bit on the small size) - comfortable beds, nice bathroom, large flat screen TV, and Bliss products in the bathroom. I really had no complaints on the room and amenities. The noise level at the hotel was high at all times. There were parties and drunken people in the hotel hallways at 3 am on a Sunday night. But, I shouldn't be surprised by that - it is Hollywood, isn't it? The hotel also has the latest hot new Hollywood nightclub called Drai's on the rooftop. The thing that I found most funny is the W motto of \"Whatever/Whenever\". After I checked in I was told this is the W motto for their guests and we should call them for whatever our needs are at anytime. However, when I called them to inquire about getting into Drai's nightclub, I was told that Drai's is a separate entity from the hotel and admission is determined by the bouncers downstairs. So, even if you are a guest of the W Hotel in Hollywood, in true Hollywood style and attitude, getting into the club is ultimately about how you look, who you know, and how you are dressed. In my opinion, that's a little bit deceiving & irritating, especially since they market this nightclub being in their hotel. Again, the hotel itself and rooms and amenities are nice. If you are looking to party and stay up all night, then stay at this hotel. If you want a quieter scene in Hollywood, you may want to stay at the Renaissance Hotel in Hollywood.

The cost of the minibar will make you think they printed the decimal places wrongly. $15 for some M&M's? - yeah, that seems so cheap.... The pool facilities are laughably poor - read tiny - and there is no space there unless a guest is prepared to buy a cabana $3500 per day.

Because the hotel restrict the hours (no doubt because someone was not paying extra $$) to during the day when the least amount of people would need it. The aircon in the room sucked.

And it paid off. I want to specifically thank them for so much\u2026 for the champagne (V.C.) and the amazing room upgrade (absolutely huge and stunning\u2026 BTW we had booked it on Starwood points) and great help with dinner reservations (e.g. adding someone to a table at BOA with 2 hrs notice on a Saturday night). When I approached the concierge desk just to ask a question, Adam knew who I was and knew my husband\u2019s name etc. And we didn\u2019t even get to thank him for the craziest thing, because we didn\u2019t find out about it until after we left the hotel: Adam had somehow called my assistant back in Montreal, and she gave him my dad\u2019s phone number, and then Adam called my dad to ask how he could make our W Hollywood experience better for us, what special things they could do for us and what we might like. That is crazy, unreal service. There was also the Acura car service but we didn\u2019t get to use it because we didn\u2019t ask early enough and by the time we asked it was all booked \u2013 so if you want to use it, ask in advance.

We never bothered to go to Drai\u2019s at night but had we wanted to, it was going to be easily arranged\u2026 there is a separate line in the lobby that you wait in which is not very long.

Beautiful lobby, outer couryard that turns into a bar at night with a huge projection tv screen (they were showing the football game). Everything is very clean and new which is wonderful - esp. in Hollywood where 'good' clean and reasonable hotels are hard to come by - esp. so close to the chinese theatre area if you are looking for the touristy stuff. However, I have to agree with other posters - I wonder if the staff are aspiring models or actors and are just there to make connections? They are certainly not as helpful as other W hotels we have stayed in (or other 4 - 5 star hotels in general). We drove. When we pulled in the valet automatically came and took our car. We said \"we're just checking in\" and the valet said \"that's fine - I'll go park your car\". When we asked how much it was they said $38 with in-and-out privileges. We asked if there was self-park and they said no self park in the hotel -but you could self park across the street but there was no in and out. When we asked at check in they said that yes you could park across the street for $10 for the day (from 6 am up until 3 am - although the front desk didn't tell us this - they just said \"yes,you can park there\" - it was the ppl at the parking lot that gave us the times) and an extra $10 for overnight (if you were going to be there between 3 am and 6 am). Had we not asked the valet would never have told us this - just taken our car - and the lot is LITERALLY across the street. The valet must take the cars there because I don't know where would be closer? We ended up parking there and when we asked at the lot they said that you COULD go in and out. Also, the pool closes at 7:00 as it turns into a bar later in the night. If you have kids or if you just want to swim you can only go until 7 and then they will close everything down and reopen it later. We werent told about this when we checked in. We weren't even told there was a pool or anything about the hotel. It's only when I saw people in the elevator in bathings suits that they told me they are trying to get a quick swim in as the pool would be closing at 7. We ran up just to take a peek at the pool before it closed and figured we would come back later for a drink as we were on our way out. When we came back at around 9:00 and tried to go up for a drink we were told that it was a bar that was not 'associated' with the hotel and the cover is $20 a person to get up (they lock off the elevators so you have to put your key in to get to the rooms and the key doesn't work to get you to the pool after 7 - you have to enter through the bar elavator). The guy at the front that was with the W said \"oh yes, we make sure and tell all our guests that there is a cover - even if you are a guest\". Well, the woman who checked us in never said anything about it. We weren't going to bother paying $40 just to get upstairs as we weren't going to stay long - we just wanted a quick drink and to see the place as we didn't have time earlier. So know this before you go - we wish we did we would have planned better. Also, in the past the cds that they give out in the room were complimentary. We took ours to listen to in the car as we've enjoyed the music on these. When we checked out (early the next morning - so too early to see the pool again) of course the guy at the front asked \"how was your stay\" and I said \"great, except for not being told about the pool turning into a bar and the cover charge\" and he said \"oh, sorry about that - she should have said something\" and that was it. Then I realized I had the cd in the car so ran it back in and said \"I forgot I took this from the room - do you charge for them? Can i just leave it here with you?\" and he said \"yes, there is a charge, if it's missing from the room you will be billed, would you like to purchase it?\" (and it wasn't that great compared to other cd plus by now I just thought \"geez - the least you coulda done was offer to let me keep the lousy cd after the whole pool mix-up\") so I said \"no thanks - if you can just put it back for me\". But come on? That's not \"4 star\" treatment and not treatment I expect from the W which in the past has been so into customer service. So again, be careful if you 'take' the cd by mistake. Also, like with many hotels, the mini fridge items are on sensors, so they will charge you if you move anything (even if you don't consume it and leave it back but take it out) - so make sure and check your bill if you use the minbar to make sure they didn't charge you for more than you took just because you moved stuff. That being said it is a really nice property. You can't beat the \"newness\" of it. Like I said - there's not much of a selection down there in Hollywood. (we've been a few times on business so stayed in a number of hotels there - including the \"haunted\" Roosevelt hotel - yuck). This is by far the nicest one in the area - unless you want to go all the way over to Beverly Hills and stay at the Luxe or somewhere like that. But it is a bit of a hike. The metro is connected to the hotel if you aren't driving so it's really convenient - and if you are driving - like I said - just self park - it's really easy. It's a 1 minute drive to the freeway which is also really handy. We took the kids to Universal Studios and it was about a 5 minute drive - but so much handier than the Universal hotels as it's so close to the Walk of Fame and the new city area they recently built. And nicer than any Sheraton or Marriott or other hotels closer to Universal. We've been to Hollywood without kids and yes, the W hotel would be more fun without kids (like, we could actually stay for a longer drink ...) but it's also fine with kids. I didn't feel out of place having my kids there and I saw lots of other kids there. My only other problem is I booked a \"fabulous\" room and as an SPG member I'm entitled to an upgrade to the next level which would be some sort of suite. Having the kids I really wanted something a bit bigger than just 2 double beds but the girl at the front said \"no, sorry, the next level up from what you booked are the suites, and we only have 8 suites in the whole hotel and they are all booked\". EIGHT suites in the whole hotel? That didin't sound right. But maybe I'm just projecting because I'm still bitter about the pool ;-) . I thought the 'fabulous' room would have had 2 beds and a couch area to give a bit more space but she said all the rooms are exactly the same (except for having either 2 queens or 1 king) except for the 8 suites. hmmmmm ... seems strange in such a big hotel. Also, all the views from the rooms aren't good. They face the parking lot, or street - no rooms face the hollywood sign or anything which is to be expected as the hotel is right in the town and the rooms aren't high enough to give much of a view. Just a point if a view is really important to you. As another poster said, the rooftop would have nice views ... just not the rooms. I paid $155 so I was really pleased for that rate - but it still doesn't excuse the lack of service. If I paid close to $300 as I know the rates can get that high I would have been really mad. But for one night - close enough to get to the sights, comfy bed, clean and really fun lobby and vibe - totally worth it. Esp. with the cheap parking across the street. If you plan on going for the nighlife be warned about the cover and plan for it - or just plan to stay by the lobby bar - it's nice there too - and was busy. Yes, it can get loud - so be warned and ask for a room away from the bar as it stays open till 3:30 if you don't want the noise.

Walls are very thin no matter what floor you are on, so be warned. Not kid friendly, you would feel really out of place (I know I would never bring my small children there). Across street there is Dhillions Irish Pub which has EXCELLENT large menu, $3 beer, free wi-fi, and is very reasonable. Katsuya is right around the corner, celebrities haunt there nightly and so does the paparazzi. Trader Joe's grocery store is close too. The Metro underground train is right out the front door, can take it right to Universal $1.50. Use the Acura service for free transport to close by attractions... .we took it to Rodeo Dr. Overall, very nice hotel.

I would think since we only stay at Starwood Hotels and I am an SPG member, parking/internet would be comped or something. Even Holiday Inn offers free WIFI. Drais night club (in W Hotel) is a big Hollywood Hot Spot with a long line forming every night. During this time it would be hard to get in the hotel because of the amount of people/cars.

We finished off a 2 night stay at the W after spending a week in Vegas. I really enjoyed this hotel and it has been my favourite over the last six 4+* US hotels I've stayed in. Yes it is a little pretentious with all the ropes and bouncers but it is in Hollywood. I loved the design of the hotel and the rooms are beautifully furnished. However I wasn't fond of the glass window dividing the shower and beds and thought this was a bit much for a shared queen room. Check in was great - loved the girl at the desk. She was very warm and friendly and thankfully gave us an early check in at 11:30. I had booked through Hotwire after working out it would be the W and there was no problems with upgrading us to a double queen room. I thought this may have been a problem as when I tried to book through their direct website it stated that a double queen room was not available for the dates specified! So it was a big bonus! We hadn't decided if we were going to use their valet parking (a bit pricey at $35 a day when there is a car park across the street) but upon check in and entering our room, the concierge rang to inform us that they had removed our bags from the car and were bringing them straight up. We hadn't even asked for this so it was very nice to not have to worry about it. They then did valet our car and the service for this was wonderful. There were also a few times when we arrived back from some shopping and parked out the front with a line of people waiting for entry and we wouldn't even be required to show our instant access passes, and would just receive a welcome back! with an immediate opening of the ropes. We used whatever/whenever a few times and they were super helpful and we also had an experience of the LA nightlife downstairs on a Friday night. It wasn't really our style but it was nice to try it out. On checkout the same lovely girl remembered my (long) name.

If this was a general review for style, location, amenities compared to say the Holiday Inns of this world, I would give it a higher rating. Upon hours of travel I arrived and went up to my room (no one even offered to help with my bags once they got them to the lobby, which was odd, but I could handle it). The room itself is similar in design to other Ws, so was nice, but the view was of an ugly parking lot. The lighting is mood lighting meaning even with every light on, you can't really see, which for a business traveler is not ideal, though typical of these trendy-style hotels. The main place the lighting bothered me was in the bathroom. I think that room should at least be bright enough to put in my contacts without struggling, but the mood lighting extended to the bathroom. A few minutes after I arrived a man came in to check on restocking the room and fridge; I thought this should have been handled prior to my check-in. He came back 10 minutes later, forgetting he had already done my room. The internet connection didn't work at first even though it charged me so I had to go down and talk to the front desk who refunded my money and I reconnected. So my first half an hour set the tone. After that it was just minor service things. My floor towel was never replaced in the 4 days I was there and had a big black shoe print, obviously from the housekeeper, on it all 4 days (in general, the cleaning job was sub-par). I never got new moisturizer despite using it up (though they did replace shampoo etc. which I didn't need). Room service didn't bring milk for my tea; upon calling to have them remove my tray one night they never came. My colleague had a broken toilet upon check-in; her in-room checkout was broken (she was only there 1 night and only in the room to sleep so these were annoyances in a brief stay). These are little things but are a-typical of what service level I have been treated to at other Ws or the other similar class hotels. I had good experiences at Delfine - nice servers and when one made 2 minor mistakes he treated us to 2 free desserts to make up, which was nice. The food/wine was pretty good and outside was nice though the inside atmosphere is a bit dull. The hotel concierges were friendly though I didn't rely on them for much. I agree with other reviewers re: Drai's. You should think of this as Drai's nightclub with an associated hotel and not the W hotel with Drai's nightclub. I find it rude and annoying that getting back into my hotel at night the bouncers (even on the parking side of the hotel) treated hotel guests a bit rudely and I had to queue up (!) and show my room key at multiple ropes inside & out just to get through to my room. Also, as there were private events daily while I was there, this closes off one of the hotel entrances I would have used out onto Hollywood Blvd. Hotel guests have to exit via \"the back door\" into parking lot like 2nd class citizens. They seem to be running a successful club, but I think the effort put into the hotel service (in relation to other Ws) is dubious.

We were able to get into Drai's after a bit of a wait on Thursday, we found it nice enough but not someplace we HAD to return to. When I requested a song of the DJ I was very rudly shot down. As I work as a DJ myself I never would have said what he said to a patron. The songs I requested were right in line with what he was actually playing, so Drai's did not really impress us. We actually turned down an invitation to return on Fri evening. The room was very nice and ultra modern although I kept banging my right shin on the edge of the platform bed, I still have the bruises. But the reason why I don't see myself returning was the noise at night. You hear EVERYTHING from doors closing to regular conversations from all directions. After a rather sleepless Thursday I asked the front desk for earplugs which I was shocked to see she had right onhand, prepackaged and ready to go! However Sat night the earplugs did nothing to mask the people who decied that the hallway outside our room was the place to party at 3am. At first I politely poked my head outside to the couple who sat on the floor in bathrobes with food and drinks laid out picnic style in front of them and asked if they would mind taking it inside as we were trying to sleep. They apoligized, then moved maybe 5 feet away and keep on their conversation. After that I called the front desk and explained the situation. Their reply was not an apology but to ask if I had earplugs. After I explained they weren't making a dent they sent up security. I was prepared for a party hotel, as I've stayed in several other W's including Mahatten but nothing prepared me for the noice level at night. We were on the 10th floor and could hear the nighclub two floors up quite well. Of the 3 nights I was there, I didn't sleep for two of them.

Also lacking was attention to small details.

We needed to get ready for the wedding and I was hoping that the room would have been cleaned already. We did eat at Drai's one night for dinner (we are not club people, so went early for dinner). The view is FANTASTIC! Everyone should at least check out the view. We did see Ryan O'Neal eating dinner there as well that night.

Upon check in, I was greeted by a friendly host at the front desk. While I wasn't offered an upgrade for my Gold Starwood status, I was placed in a good sized room with a driveway view. I was a little disappointed by the view, but very impressed by the room. Everything was fresh, new, clean, and very chic. The bathroom was clean, well apportioned. The big screen TV and charger with adaptors was a nice touch. The room was very quiet and I slept well on a so-so comfortable bed. The gym was large, with all of equipment that you need for a workout. There was a large stretch room with amazing views of the city and Hollywood Hills. The lobby of the hotel, and adjacent lounge area was spectacular. I enjoyed drinks several evenings on the outdoor bar/lounge area with out door fire pits and comfortable lounge furniture. The bar tenders were friendly and the drinks were decent, with prices that I'd expect at this type of venue. I was a little disappointed that one evening when I tried to get up to the upstairs lounge/bar, I was told that I wasn't on the list. Apparently the hotel throws some private parties, which means you have to be VIP (which I'm not) to get in. On my check out, I was greeted by a manager who promptly assigned a desk attendant to handle my check out. The valet parking was expensive, but I was able to self park in the lot directly across the street for $20/night, with in/out privileges. I'm not afraid to write a critical review, but I can honestly say that my stay at the W Hollywood was a pleasure. As long as you don't expect to roll in and be treated like a star (when you're not), then you'll be fine. I was treated professionally, and thought the accommodations were excellent.

We walked for one hour in the neigbourhood and after that we wanted to get back in the hotel. But the security man at the door would not let us get in because we didnt have our room keys yet.... So we had to walk another half block to the other entrance. Again we had to wait almost 30 minutes for the check in desk until we got our room keys, then we asked for our luggage that had been placed in the luggage room. They said they forgot to label our luggage and didn't knew what luggage was ours, so we had to get in the luggage room ourselves to search for our bags and then take it to our rooms ourselves! Incredible bad service for a 4* hotel! When we arrived at our room we were pleasantly surprised, very nice large room with very trendy furniture and decoration. We found it a bit odd that you had to pay extra for everything in the room, up to 9$ for a bottle of water. That night there were 2 parties in the hotel, one on the roof near the pool, and another one in the lounge, just beneath our window. It went on until 4 am with very loud music, and because of that very bad sleep. The following day we made a trip to warner bros (very nice) and when we came back, the elevator didn't respond to our room keys. When another friendly guest helped us to get to our floor, we noticed that our room keys were totally not working anymore. So again back to reception and got new keys. Fortunately second night less noise! When we checked out we discussed all of our problems, and we got the costs for the valet parking creditted. Yesterday we arrived home after our trip and saw that the hotel did charge our CC.

This was a special weekend as it was my fiance, Tira, and my anniversary, as well as our best friend's birthday.

With minimal effort, we were escorted right up to the club, seated at a great table, and all our needs accommodated -- all the guests (especially Tira) had an fantastic time. It is clear that that W Hollywood sets the highest standards for its services and staff; and I greatly appreciate the efforts of Chris and the rest of the staff.

We had been watching and reading the reviews for this hotel daily before our trip and to be honest was anticipating the stay to be not so pleasant....... Well I can honestly say that the negative reviews are way off base. We checked in on Friday of the July 4 long weekend and was in our hotel room within minutes after a long day at Universal Studios. The rooms are impecably clean, and have yummy spa products and a huge rain shower head...my boyfriend literally showered 3 times in one day!!! It was like a mini spa. The bed was heaven after exploring LA during the days and the maids did an awesome job tidying our rooms and providing fresh towels and linens and of course refilling the spa products! There is anything you could want in the room from Figi water to grey goose vodka even with a martini shaker and of course lots of yummy treats! Our room was on the third floor facing the Living Room Lounge and was a bit loud into the night...but I called \"Whatever/Whenever\" for ear plugs and shortly fell asleep. The other nights we didn't seem to notice...but perhaps may have been due to the fatigue or wine consumption... Overall every inch of the hotel is spotless and stunning to look at. All of the staff were very friendly to us and didn't feel it was an act. The valet was easy, we never had to wait for our car (but usually called ahead from the room). The much anticipated line to pass to enter the hotel from Hollywood Blvd was not an issue....ever. We were greated pleasantly and almost escorted to the door. We also had no problem getting past the line to go to Drai's as there is a seperate line inside the hotel for guests. When asked who to talk to for access into the club a staff member directed us to Chris Nelson...who actually existed and was right on his word to get into the club! Also there is a seperate elevator to Drai's and the pool during the day for non hotel guests. The pool scene was pretty chill...not a big pool but the fun of it is that its on the roof!! There is a pool party during the day on Sundays that we weren't interested in going to, but I had asked the doorman if we had to pay or wait in the line and he pleasantly replied \"No mam! Just put your suit on and go have some fun!\". This hotel stands out for service in the details....there is a car service that will take you anywhere in the LA vicinity and we really enjoyed that service for a ride to Madeo. We were considering on not keeping our reservation for dinner as did not want to taxi or drive there, but after being offered a complimentary ride how could you turn that down!!! We didn't eat in any of the restaurants but did order room service for dessert and of course it was delicious. There is complimentary coffee in the lobby in the mornings which was very nice. We also used the gym and had great workouts!! Lots of equipment and top of the line cardio machines with personal TV's and plenty of water to hydrate.

Upon our arrival, we were greeted by friendly driveway staff who directed us into the absolutely incredible lobby. We were check-in by Theresa who informed us that we had been upgraded! We made our way up to our floor, past the diamond-studded peep-hole into our home for the next week. Although some of the surrounding area (Hollywood Blvd.) could use a bit of sprucing up, the hotel was definately a gem. We would often walk to Hollywood & Highland (about 15 mins) for shops restaurants and attractions such as Kodak Theare, Chinese Theatre and El Capitan. This hotel is absolutely the place to see and be seen and I truly believe Drai's and W have had a big meeting because entering the hotel was never an issue (contrary to past reviews). Speaking of which, Drai's is an amazing club (we saw Paris Hilton there) and the pool is a popular spot even during the day. It is true that the chairs are limited, but we were told we could lie on our towels on the deck of a unoccupied cabana until chairs were available. The staff in the Living Room (bar in the loby) was extremely friendly and we ended up having a drink there almost every night. I also recommend trying their chocolate fondue as it is delicious. I should also mention that for the people who want to use internet to check e-mails etc. and don't want to pay the daily charge, can use the free wi-fi in the Living Room. Delphine (the in-house restaurant) is well decorated and although we only had a small bite there, was very good. The hotel also had infused water or coffee (depending on the time) available in the lobby which was very appreciated! As far as notable staff, Chris (W Insider) is definately someone you should contact if you are looking to plan an unforgettable night in the city. He was well informed about shows and events going on around town and was a lot of help for getting information about Drai's. Once we met him, he always recognized us and always said hi (props and hugs) to us whenever he saw us around the hotel. The concierge desk was also very helpful and was able to get us recommendations for restaurants and directions for places we were visiting. Adam was the concierge we delt with the most and he was very helpful. Finally, although I do not know her name, the lady in Style (housekeeping) made our room feel like home. Everyday we would come back to find our shopping bags organized and our toileteries perfectly arranged and placed on a fresh towel. I know these ladies often don't get the credit they deserve for their hard work, but it was very much appreciated.

A glass shower that offers a floor to ceiling window view right out into the bedroom area. Sure, the glass is 'frosted' from about your knees to your chest but let's just say it's not frosted ENOUGH! And even if you aren't in the bathroom to use the shower, whatever it is you are doing in there, whether you're on the toilet, brushing your teeth, changing clothes, you won't be doing any of this in privacy (unless you are staying alone) because if no one is in the shower, we get a clear view of whatever is going on there.

I was working in LA, so we booked a group of 4 of us (3 of us SPG gold card holders) into the W Hotel Hollywood. W is considered an aspirational brand, and most W hotels are fun, funky and supposed to be trendy. This hotel seemed to have its very own ego. Walking past the disinterested doorman (roped off, presumably to \"keep the riff-raff out\"?), upon entry they require guests to deposit $500 on a credit card (yes, $500!) even if your room & tax are pre-paid. Now one of our party didn't have $500 left on his card, and had arrived a day earlier while we made our way to LA. The hotel staff were quite happy to send him back out into the street without negotiation (even though his room had been pre-paid!). Thankfully (though after a lot of persuasion to largely deaf ears) we were able to use one of our own cards over the phone to place the deposit. Why they couldn't have just taken a smaller deposit of $150 or held his passport until we arrived, I do not know. Perhaps they were expecting him to steal the TV? This made us look bad as the colleague in question was working for us, and was technically under our hospitality. Not a nice experience after a 10 hour long haul flight. A day later the rest of the party arrived and checked in. Well, we tried. Despite having high status with SPG and it being nearly 4pm, our rooms were not ready. We were offered a room DOWNGRADE (note that normally you are offered an upgrade) if we needed to check into our rooms, which we did. We took the room downgrade as we were working at night at a concert. I would have expected to have some kind of credit applied to my room ($20 or so or a free drink? Would have made me feel a lot happier about the experience). At the outside bar we ordered snacks from a waitress that can only be described as indifferent and obnoxious, firing verbal abuse at our party when we were annoyed at slow service. Once the bill arrived, we discovered why - service is added to all bills. Normally in the USA service in restaurants and bars is impeccable, because the staff have to work for it. Not here - they get it added anyway, so there is no need to go the extra mile as they do in the rest of LA. My experience of the W hotel Hollywood has tarnished the whole W brand for me. Thankfully I understand SPG hotels are owned by different companies - important as I would not want to give any more of my money to this particular organisation. I have stayed in W Hotels cities all over the USA and never had a problem. I should point out at this point that the rooms in the West Hollywood W are extremely nice. Comfortable beds etc. It is the staff that let the hotel down (and the whole W brand nationally as a result), with their snobby attitude towards guests. Totally unnecessary, and to think we PAID to stay there. Surely you pay to be treated with respect in a hotel, and equally guests should respect the staff? It is even an effort to get in and out of the hotel, with guests treated as rather incidental to the whole \"party scene\" of the property. There is more. My friend ordered room service and received completely the wrong order, and I was charged 3 times for internet access despite being there for under 24 hours. Thankfully after having to ask twice, this was removed, as was the room service charge. Will the management contact me to resolve this? I seriously doubt it. It takes something for me to take the time and effort to complain, but I shall be on the phone to SPG to let them know of my experience.

It was my main reason for staying here - metro is outside the hotel. The terminal was new and nice. The ceiling contained rounded movie films. Used the metro to get to Universal Studios. Took around 15-20 minutes. - 10 -15 minute walk gets you to the tourist areas of Hollywood such as the Kodak theater - Universal mobile charger system. - My room was high up and I had a fairly nice view. - Comfortable bed / nice shower. - Had dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant and I had no complaints.

I do not mind a busy atmosphere but I am in the mood in relaxing at my hotel not competing for a table. - I went through 3 layers of security to get to my room at night.

The rooftop pool is lovely and I believe accessible during the day but not at all at night when the club is operating.

I have been a starwood member for the past 8 years and have never been so misinformed and deceived until I stayed at the W in hollywood. First, I asked what rooms they had available when I came into registration. When I was told that every type of room was available, I then asked for an upgrade as a gold member, and was not given one. Okay fine, I didn't want to argue or call SPG and try to figure out why I was being denied an upgrade. It happens. This wasn't a big deal. Second, I had bottle service reservations at the hotel's restaurant, Drai's and was later told that I didn't have any. I contacted the W staff and complained about the situation, and a guy named Chris, who works for \"Whatever, whenever\" said he'd take care of it. I had a client coming in from across town to discuss some business over dinner and drinks. To my surprise, I was denied entrance to Drai's, or their restaurant. Chris kept giving me the run around. I was very embarrassed at this situation and couldn't believe that this so called friendly staff did not do enough to remedy the situation. Their excuse was that Drai's was a separate entity, when in fact, Drai's is on every phone speed dial in every room, advertised in each room, and highlighted on the W's website. If this is not misleading, then I do not know what is. Third, just because you are staying here doesn't mean you can dine at their restaurant or hang out at their pool or even have a drink at the bar. In fact, you are in par with the general public, which is absolutely absurd. I witnessed people who were not guests in the hotel gain entrance to the hotel's restaurant. I had to look for a restaurant outside the hotel. This is a big problem. Lastly, the staff here have a lot to learn about running a hotel and treating their customers with some respect.

Nothing else. We called down to see if it could be remade properly, someone came up and dropped a stack of flat sheets at our door and scurried away. Not that we were able to sleep anyway... The noise of the club downstairs echo'ed into our room (bass drum sounds all night) well past 2am on weeknights, and we woke up at 7am to incessant hammering. When we finally called the front desk at 7:30am to complain about the noise, the front desk person audibly snickered. She actually laughed out loud at my complaint. When I asked her why she thought it was funny, she said \"oh, ummm sorry, it's not funny, we can hear it too and it's really loud\" -- OK, then thanks for doing something about the racket. Isn't it your job to attend to these things before people complain? Or to offer any kind of solution? She then put me on hold for 10 minutes listening to music that ensured I wouldn't be able to fall asleep even if the hammering stopped. And then, of course, the hammering never stopped, and the front desk person was unapologetic, and didn't offer earplugs OR COMPASSION. This is the kind of place where earplugs should be dropped in your hand along with the room key when you check in. We slept less than 3 hours that night due to all the noise at night and in the morning. Rude and absurd, uncourteous and unclassy. We ordered breakfast in the room and my $20 waffle had three pathetic strawberries on it and tasted & looked like a stale Eggo. We got a slab of bacon heaped on top of my husband's meal -- Thanks, DUMMIES, we're vegetarians! Final total for inedible crap: $53. Our wake up calls never came through. Our toiletries were never replenished. Our final bill was incorrect. A friend who came to pick us up was told that he wasn't allowed to pull into the stadium-sized driveway to wait TWO MINUTES for us to descend in the elevator, told that he would have to circle the block and call us to have us meet him on the street.

We were asked if we had a reservation. We said yes. We were asked our names. We told them. We were then passed through the velvet ropes and into reception area. The restaurant was on the other side of the lobby (which is essentially a giant nightclub). To cross the lobby we met Man in Black Suit #2. He asked us where we where going, did we have a reservation, what were our names? Testly we answered again and we were passed through. On the far side of the lobby Man in Black Suit #3 allowed us to pass into the restaurant where the hostess said \"How are you doing?\" To which we replied, \"Not so happy about all the velvet ropes.\" She was nice, seated us and we proceeded to have a lovely meal, fabulous food, reasonably priced, great service and we were wiling to let the bad experience pass because the food was so great.
