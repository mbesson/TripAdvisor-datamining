Kimpton means free Internet ,free happy hour and one or two other treats on arrival if you are a member( easy online sign up) This hotel is in an excellent position for the conference centre and town shopping and on public transport to the ferry building and fisher mans wharf. The large Westfield mall is just behind the hotel, also a supermarket. Union square is 2 blocks, and one block down market street is the excellent Bluestem restaurant. We had a one bedroom suite for family of 3 . Nice decor, light rooms looking out on market street, plenty of room which we appreciated. Onsite good room service, excellent restaurant, very good reception and concierge staff. Free bikes are available. Surprisingly little street noise. Beds were good. Cons- not much. A free breakfast would have been more use to us than free drinks at 5-6pm as we were never back by then. The layout of the suite means hard not to see the person in the sitting area pullout bed and they have to come through the bedroom to access the bathroom . There more suited to a family than friends especially as partition is slider doors. Not sure how big the double rooms are, our friend also staying separately wasn,t as keen on his outlook into an inner courtyard. Room tip: room 730 was a lovely junior suite with plenty of space.

The Palomar is a boutique hotel -- cool as a cucumber, and they know it. The hotel is attractive in a nouveau chic kind of way -- cool lines, earth tones, dark, everyone wears black, etc. But that's okay, I kind of like the look. The front desk is much friendlier than before -- they smile and greet you like an old friend, which after a long day, I appreciate. I asked for (and received the next morning) a specific newpaper, which I liked. (They normally provide the NY Times, but I'm a USA Today kind of guy). One thing they did not do, however, was look up my Klimpton number for me, a small annoyance. My room was tiny. Disappointingly so, as I've stayed in much larger rooms previously. Further, it lacked ammenities that I've enjoyed before -- it seemed a little stripped down. Finally, as an interior room, I had a view of other interior rooms. As a plus, I received a coupon for a free appetizer at the bar/restaurant on my floor (5th). Although I got there at the end of their meal service, the chef cooked up a pair of prosciutto croquettes, which were tasty. The service at the bar was excellent! The room was quiet, the bed was comfortable, and while the room was a little tiny, I still like this hotel. Finally, the location is excellent -- close to BART, right in Union Square for shopping, etc.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cBest location, classy room\u201d", "Author": "sea2skyaus", "ReviewID": "UR128959108", "Content": "Pros -Excellent location, right on Market street, 2 meters from the tram and train stop.

My previous experiences involved extremely friendly and helpful staff members. The friendly people I encountered at this particular Klimpton hotel were the doormen, the valet, and the maid. It would probably help the overall feel of the hotel if the personalities of the doormen could be transferred to the front desk personnel. It's not that the front desk persons I dealt with during my stay were mean; they were ambivalent and there to earn a paycheck (like dealing with the DMV). Upon arriving at the front desk to check in (around 9:00 PM), I quietly waited to see if the clerk would look up from her handheld screen. I probably should have been vocal, but I was not in a hurry and was a bit intrigued by her fixation on whatever message it held. When she looked up, I have absolutely no idea what she said, but I assumed it was some sort of greeting. All I really got from her monotone monologue was that the bar on the 5th floor opened at midnight and that I had to use the free drink coupons then. Luckily the key pouch had my room number on it. The room itself has the same amazing sheets and bed as my other Klimpton stays. This decor of the room is better described as a business hotel than as a boutique hotel. Everything was clean, but worn (especially the carpet). It's basically a Marriott caliber room with Motel 6 carpet and a heavenly bed. The leopard skin and zebra skin robes in the closet that felt like they were several years old sum up the ambiance of the room. It's in a great location in terms of being able to walk to anything (BART, Chinatown, North Beach, the Moscone Center, and so on). I think it's overpriced for what you get, and if you are looking to be in that area at a lower price, you can find a few places close by. As instructed by the front desk clerk, I waited until just before midnight for the bar to open only to get there at 11:58 and learn they were closing. The waitress couldn't have been happy by the timing of my arrival, but was professional and offered a compromise of getting an easy to pour drink. I appreciate that she was willing to stay a little past the end of her shift to accommodate the fallout of my not getting valid information from the front desk clerk. The bar and restaurant are very well appointed and stylish. I think a heads up that parking was going to cost $51.30 a night would have been nice. That's not a typo either, we're talking $51.30 to store a car for fourteen hours on a weekend. I definitely got the feel that this hotel was all about the money. Dropping $289 + tax for a room and $51 for parking should have gotten me much more in terms of style.

I was treated to some terrible music both carried up from the store and from a transient synthesizer player (synthesist?) starting at about 3am. Needless to say it made sleep a bit difficult. I paid a little extra this trip for a corner room. It was certainly more spacious, but the space was not utilized well. The bathroom was not upgraded either. Not sure if I'd do the corner room again (even on another floor). The basic room I stayed in previously was ample enough. If you have the need for a roll-away bed, the corner room would be perfect, though. I hate to add this last gripe, as I could have potentially resolved the problem with a phone call but didn't. The pillows were huge and too firm. As a side sleeper, I was too askew to be comfortable. Not sure if the hotel has alternate pillows available and I should've made an effort to find out.

The cable cars begin at the Powell Street Station, San Francisco Centre is 1/2 block away, Union Square is 2-3 blocks depending on which you walk, the SFMOMA is three blocks away and in between is the Contemporary Jewish Museum (great Houdini exhibit). With regard to the rooms, it was probably my least favourite Kimpton (Philadelphia is my favourite so far). We were in a corner suite which was a bit oddly shaped with colours that were not warm or otherwise appealing. People have mentionned the noise of Market Street but while we were conscious of traffic particularly if an ambulance or police car went by with siren on, it was not at all obtrusive. We were however on the 8th floor. The Fifth Floor restaurant was kind of disappointing; we only had breakfast there and it was mostly empty and the food was nothing to write home about (my poached eggs on an English muffin were not runny but solid; the fruit salad was almost flavourless. You had coffee next to the restaurant which was fine with plenty of NYTimes all around. It was our anniversary and the hotel provided a complimentary cheese plate and sparking apple cider (we were offered champagne but we are teetolers.)

We had a four night stay in a King room (835) and very much enjoyed the location and quality of the hotel. As noted above, the location is perfect for being centrally located in San Francisco but only a 15-20 minute ride on the F Train ($2 fare each way) to get to Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel like all Kimptons we have experienced (Helix, DC & Muse, NY) are very nice hotels with very good service from the staff. Our room on Level 8 was only average in size and possibly smaller than The Muse in New York. The free wine hour is always appreciated as well as the small complimentary continental breakfast. This was not quite enough to satisfy but certainly worth having along with a little something else from the menu. As a Kimpton member, free Wi-Fi is also provided. We signed up to the Kimpton membership (for free) before leaving NZ and it is certainly worth doing. The Kimptons all have a free filter coffee service in the restaurant area for guests in the morning. This is a nice touch but as they don't have coffee making facilities in the rooms, one of us had to get up and go and get the coffee each morning. I am not sure why they don't offer a coffee service in the rooms? One issue we did have was the size and quality of the gym. With only three pieces of cardio (bike, X-Trainer and Treadmill), one multi-gym and some dumbbells, it was hardly big enough for two people. Having stayed at three Kimptons in October 2011, the Palomar had the worst gym set-up by some margin.

We were here to celebrate someone's birthday, and I meant to make it a wonderful experience to that special person.

Since this is a \"Four star, Luxury Boutique\" hotel, I had high expectations on it; unfortunately, it met none. Let me start with our \u201cseries of unfortunate events\" - Arrived at 1.45pm, early for check-in time, but the front desk prompted us that our room is ready! I asked for upgrade but she said the hotel was fully committed. Regardless, we were happy and excited to check in early. As we arrived to our room, we found the room service lady was still in there, but we didn't mind. I then asked for her help turning on the AC, she did but not without struggling with it. Again, we did not mind. Then, as I walked the lady out & tried to close the door, we discovered that the door was stuck and wouldn't close. She said she would go for help. Ten minutes later, I called front desk for status and only then we had someone came. Eager to explore the city, we left our room while the gentleman was fixing the door. He assured us for the safety of our luggage and that the door would be fixed right away. -We got back to the hotel 5 hours later and found the door was fixed, but then we noticed that the water in our bath tub drained very very slow (at least 20 minutes for draining from a shower). Too tired from our long walk, we decided not to bother and went to bed. Our room is a deluxe double double which turns out to be quite small. It has 2 queen beds, 1 small table with only 2 chairs and so only 2 of us can seat while others had to stand. The beds are average but the pillows are very soft. I asked for a non-pet and quite room, and was given a non-pet and next to Market Street. We can hear lots of noise from the street: fire trucks, bus, ambulance....We could barely sleep during our entire stay. -The next morning, I went downstairs and reported the bathroom issue with the front desk. As soon as I got back to our room, someone showed up and got it fixed. We were offered a complementary movie for our not so good experience. While I appreciate the prompt response from the staff, I wished the room was fully checked before our arrival. -Next, while putting our stuff in the closet, I found 2 broken hangers, one of which I was able to fix. I left the other broken one on the ground, hoping someone would notice that and would replace it. When I got back to the hotel later that day, the broken hanger was still there, nicely hanging on the rack and was still broken. -Then we found a problem with the flush switch in out toilet. It stayed that way for the rest of our stay. In addition to the mentioned events, I have few positive and negative notes. I'll start with the negatives and then end on a positive one: -The hotel has no lobby and the lounge on fifth floor is tiny and dark (it has dim ceiling lights and no windows) -They play loud music early in the morning in the lounge, so loud that we could hear the music from our room on the same floor. In fact, the music woke me up one day. -The hotel advertises for a \"Business center\" where guests can use computer and internet without charge, but the room is closed during our entire 4 days stay. I was advised to use another computer near the lounge but there's a charge for everything I do on it. -When I booked, one of the listed amenities is Aveda bath products, but I found none during our stay there. There's shampoo, conditioner and lotion, but they are not Aveda. I felt I was cheated. -Bathroom has just a slide door and there's no fan. After the shower, we would have to wait for a while for the mist on the mirror to clear out. -The bathroom is right next to the bed and so all of us pretty much had to sleep or wake up at the same time. -As other reviewers noted, the wine reception only lasts from 5-6pm. While it is nice, we could never make it back to the hotel during this hour. -The fridge is tiny, but we managed. On a positive Note -Location: few minutes walk from BART station, cable car, F-line trains, Westfield mall, Union Square...About 15-20 minute walk to ChinaTown, North beach. I took the F-line to FishermanWharf -My son had a gold fish for his pet and there is a beautiful chocolate lab that greets us when we check in. -The staff is super nice and friendly. They are the only reasons for my positive feelings about this hotel. -The hotel is overall clean. Although the hotel doesn't have a lobby, they offer water flavored with various fruits near the check-in desk -Kimpton In Touch member can get free wifi and $10 mini bar treats. All in all....I think I would prefer to stay at the nearby Marriott next time. The lack of sleep and space were just too difficult to manage and certainly not worth the price we paid on this hotel.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cNice place, great service\u201d", "Author": "aguyinthe818", "ReviewID": "UR118872514", "Content": "Stayed here on a weekender in SF.

So after more discussion, we eventually were moved to the 7th floor and no more drone. Which brings up a second issue. The staff are very young and very inexperienced. Maybe the summer interns? I am sure they mean well and are very friendly and welcoming. But they don't seem to know much about their own hotel and its services -- much less the city of San Francisco. After asking direction from one of the front desk people, I realized I knew more about how to get where we were going than he did. Nobody mentioned that there was coffee available on the 5th floor -- learned that from reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. When we checked out, the clerk stuffed our receipt into an envelope without ever asking me to review. When I did pull it out at the airport, I found she had overcharged my credit card and left us with a credit balance. Why? Totally inexplicable. It necessitated a phone call to the hotel to get it straightened out. So, yes, this is a lovely hotel in a very convenient location.

Everything about this hotel was fabulous! We upgraded to a suite for very little extra and it was huge, clean and luxurious. It completely made the trip feel like a getaway. Bed was super comfortable. We loved being on the 5th floor steps away from the nightly wine reception. The goldfish bowl was such a nice touch. It served as a nightlight for the kids and they even named him Goldie. The location could not have been better. Steps away from BART, Cable Car stop, bustop, Westfield Mall, Walgreens, restaurants, great stores for shopping. But since it was off a side street, we were far enough away from the chaos of the main Market Street area. The free coffee in AM, fruity water all day, yummy iced tea 2-4, then wine reception at night were such a nice bonus. This saved us so much money in buying coffee, water and drinks for the 4 of us. It was nice to be able to sign up for the Kimpton In Touch club. This gave us free wireless internet which we used daily and a mini bar credit which also came in handy. The service at Hotel Palomar could not have been better. We were there on our 12th anniversary trip w/our kids and we had actually come to San Francisco 12 years ago for our honeymoon. They treated us to Proseco (not sure how they knew this was my favorite!) & chocolate in our suite, then snacks and movies for the boys. Rachel at the front desk went above and beyond to be helpful and make us feel special here. She greeted us by name and got to know our boys. I must say though that I noticed many other guests being called by name which is a nice touch. The entire front desk staff was so nice, friendly and helpful. It's hard to say what I liked best since I liked so much about Hotel Palomar. But something I have not already mentioned is I liked not having to wait - for anything. Elevators were fast, was always someone at front desk ready to help us in seconds, asked for things from housekeeping and it came immediately. Bell service came immediately. This is very different from what we would have experienced at a larger chain type hotel. I think the kids favorite thing was the house dog Maverick. What a treat to have him hang out at the front desk and visit with him everyday. The only negative we experienced was in the hotel restaurant for breakfast. We decided to try it and take advantage of the Kids Eat Free promotion. It ended up being understaffed that day and the service was both slow and bad. After expressing concern we were treated much nicer but the main issue still came down to not enough people working and one person trying to do it all. I will say at night the French Fries were excellent.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockton, California", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay and would recommend it\u201d", "Author": "ZinSkier", "ReviewID": "UR116285981", "Content": "Our bellhop went out of his way to help us unload our car and get our bags to the room.

When we arrived (after a very long flight) the reception staff were very friendly and quickly organised allowing us to get up to our room (an upgrade over what we had booked - much appreciated) and get out to grab some dinner. When we returned we found an ice bucket and bottle of wine in our room from the duty manager and their staff - another unexpected and nice touch. Our room was great, comfortable bed, clean bathroom and the room was a good size for a city center hotel. There was some street noise at night but this was something we expected with the hotel being so central and it's not exactly something the hotel could control. The room we initially booked was on the other side of the hotel (not overlooking the main street) so these may be quieter than the one we had. Although we didn't take advantage of the wine reception that was held daily (we were too busy out exploring) we thought this was also another nice touch. As was the courtesy call from the front desk the night before we checked out to check we had enjoyed our stay.

I had to call the hotel directly. Because of this, I was able to make personal contact with the hotel staff. That personal connection remained for the entire time I, and by 21 year old daughter, stayed at the Hotel Palomar in San Francisco. We were staying in SF for just a day and a night to have a mother/daughter night. The hotel inquired about the purpose of our stay. When they found out we were trying to spend some time together, they went out of their way to provide us with wonderful amenities. Not only did they upgrade our room, but they left us a personal note welcoming us and assuring us that they would provide anything we needed. When we got to the hotel, they immediately assisted with both our baggage and the car. We were checked in quickly- greeted by names and welcomed by wonderful staff and a beautiful dog. We immediately felt as though we were being pampered, nurtured and cared for- in a lovely hotel- by people who cared. Everyone seemed to know our name and everyone wanted to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves, that the room was set up to our liking and that we were able to get to the places we wanted to go. The suite that they put us in was wonderful. Not only did it look great - but it was pristinely clean, bright and cheery. The bathroom was impeccably clean and the products they provided were spa quality. Because I joined their 'in touch program', they knew I liked extra towels and a particular type of pillow. All of those items were waiting for us. Shopping was first on our agenda and we were a half block away from some of San Francisco's best shopping. When we returned, we had a tray of fresh fruit and cheese and bread waiting for us. Additionally, the hotel offers a hosted wine hour. We went down to the bar and were immediately offered a choice of lovely wines. Of course, it started pouring that evening. The hotel had umbrellas if we needed them and immediately hastened to assist us in getting a cab. They had recommendations for great dining and when we came in from our meal, made sure that that was satisfactory as well. Later, my daughter wanted desert from room service. The room service was delivered quickly and efficiently and she thought it was delicious. I had a bit of work to do and I was able to get on the internet quickly as well. The internet is offered free for guests- a very nice perk. We hated to leave the next day as we felt we were saying goodbye to friends. Checkout was as easy and efficient as check in. I look forward to my next stay in San Francisco. I will always be on the lookout for Hotel Palomar in general and will definitely return to the hotel in SF- despite the fact that there are hundreds of other choices. I think the hotel is wonderful choice for everyone- be it someone on a business trip- the location is perfect or someone on a leisure trip- as it's central location- near SF's esteemed cable cars and shopping is right at your fingertips.

Overall the hotel was nice and the service was great. I wanted to give it 3.5 stars, but I can't figure out 1/2 stars, and based on service gave it 4. The hotel is very well located for visiting San Francisco, many parts of the city are an easy walk, the Bart is right outside and it is a very easy walk to the Cable Cars. It is probably the best location I've found for seeing multiple parts of the city. The lobby is well appointed and the front desk is easy to access, with a sofa to sit on if you need to wait minute or two. They offered different waters (plain, lemon, and strawberry) which we really enjoyed. It was nice to refresh yourself after being out and about. Service: The service was great, everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. Checkin and checkout went smoothly, and all my interactions with the front desk were great. The restaurant was closed for most of our stay and the only service issue we encountered was that they did not stock the continental breakfast well or maintain the lounge it was served in. Room: We apparently had an upgraded room, from a garden view to an outside view, but I wouldn't consider it much of an upgrade personally. The room was definitely on the small side, even compared to other San Fran hotels we've stayed in. The set of the room could have been better. The entry to the bathroom was a pocket door right next to the bed, and I'm talking less than 3' from one side of the bed. Definitely not a good situation for bathroom privacy. The bathroom was well enough appointed, but there was absolutely no ventilation so it was steamy and again the privacy issue if you get what I mean. The toiletries were nice though. The room overlooked Market St, which at this location, there isn't much look at, and you get a lot of street noise in my opinion. We got there on a Saturday and there were high school bands playing right under our window, we wanted to unwind a bit after a cross-country flight, but it was more relaxing to leave the hotel. They did mention they are frequently there. The furnishings in the room were in good shape and the bed was comfortable. The room was showing wear and tear though, the carpet was threadbare/ripped in someplaces, which is something that makes me a little crazy in hotels. It just gives it a shabby, Motel 6 atmosphere. The room had a safe, mini-bar, iron and blow dryer. Food: The restaurant was closed when we were there. I am still undecided about my recommendation as to whether or not to stay at the hotel. For the price I am not sure that it is worth it, given some of the room conditions. Based on the location and service, yes. Based on the condition and overall condition of the room, no.

First, I asked for a quiet room (my top concern while traveling, and clearly noted in my InTouch profile) and was placed in room 742 directly across from the De Young meeting room on the 7th floor. Unfortunately, I did not notice the meeting room until after I had all my stuff unpacked. Over the course of my stay the noise coming from the various meetings taking place was bothersome. I did not request a room change simply because I did not want to re-pack my stuff and move. I did mention, politely, the issue upon check-out, but the front desk clerk simply said \u201csorry about that.\u201d That was disappointing as a small credit for this inconvenience should have been considered. A second more minor concern involves the prices at the Fifth Floor restaurant. I do not mind paying (to an extent) premium prices for the ambience and comfort of this type of place, but $9 for a simple lettuce salad (minuscule in size) and $24 for an overly smallish entree of mushroom risotto seemed outlandishly high.

Small lobby...........some may not care too much about the lobby decor So overall, it's good for the price I paid, and the location to the Moscone is excellent. However, there were other government rate hotels around the area (Hilton), which looked more impressive. FINAL NOTEE: I've read some people complaining about the bums. This is Union square in SF.........no matter what hotel you stay at in the U SQ area, you CANNOT avoid the bums (unless you hide in your hotel 24/7).

I spent 5 nights in San Fran for a conference at the Moscone Center, and other events at a nearby chain hotel that is the largest in San Francisco. While the latter is good (I've stayed there in the past,) the Palomar provided a better experience and value all around at a somewhat lower price. It is a short walk to the Moscone Center, and is centrally located to other short-walk attractions like Union Square and the Chinatown gate. It is very near a stop for the tram/streetcar and other mass transit options (and frankly, across the street from that major chain hotel where all the taxis seem to line up.) The San Fran Museum of Modern Art is a short walk. The Ferry Building is at the end of Market Street, either by tram or a good walk if you are in the mood. The spacious 2-bed room #720 was great for our purposes (I invited my sister during the stay.) The decor was sleek-modern but warm and comfortable. While overlooking busy Market Street and up towards Union Square, this room was very quiet except for the occaisional ambulance or fire truck -- and even those noises were subdued; we could have slept through it. Looking out over the life of a city is something we enjoy as long as it is quiet enough. This hotel does sound-proofing very well, even when it seemed like it was pretty full. Still, there was a nice-enough courtyard if you want more buffer with an inner-facing room. The beds were soooo comfortable, with a selection of pillows and bolsters for sleeping, reading, etc. There are perfect-weight, not-too-warm duvets and top sheets with quality linens. A/C worked quietly and perfectly. Good-size closet and drawer space. All of the usual-or-better amenities in a good business class hotel are there -- iron & board, mini bar that had room to store a few things besides the stocked items, safe (roomy but not large enough for my laptop,) good laundry service, high-quality towels, Aveda toiletries, large desk/work surface, good flat-screen TV and options, etc. There are a few extra-nice things: wonderful robes, an umbrella if it rains, complimentary quality newspapers like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal as well as the local SF paper, etc. Complimentary internet access (although you may have to register as a member of \"the club\" -- free -- I forget.) My incredibly minor, nit-picky gripe: the clock radio does not have a light-up dial, so it was hard to tell the time if you woke up at night. There was no in-room coffee maker, but excellent coffee/tea is served in the lounge 6 - 9 a.m. FREE wine is served 5-6 in the same area, but you could take it up to your room. It was nice to have this there when dressing for dinner or you just want to put your feet up, although the lounge is sociable, modern-sleek and comfortable. 'No stingy attitude by the wine server, either. Chilled waters in urns in the lobby provide refreshment throughout the day/evening. Spotless, friendly housekeeping. Exellent, helpful staff throughout, but Matt at the door deserves special attention for his helpfulness and advice. I had a wake-up call every morning that arrived right on time -- with a REAL PERSON at the other end!!! MUST MENTION the excellent restaurant, Fifth Floor. We dined well at many restaurants in San Fran, but this was a highlight of an American menu with French preparations. Small plates and mains provide a lot of variety and while note cheap, well-priced for this level of quality and menu. While not a large menu, the variety is good and there is lots to like. There were a few complimentary amuse-gouts surpises, too. Nice cheese selection of note. I understand that there may be a new chef in November, but we'd be happy with the one currently on duty. The waitstaff and hostess were friendly, polished professionals. I'd go back in a minute, even if I wasn't staying at this hotel. Also: the bar area is very comfortable with the bar and tables, and you can get dinner there, too, if you'd prefer not to be at a table in the restaurant. I've done this before when I was on my own and the restaurant was booked (which is how I learned about this hotel.) There is also a chocolate labrador dog at reception every day, 8-5, which reinforces the hotel's support of animal rescue and care. No business center to speak of, but the service at the desk makes up for it, e.g. will print boarding passes complimentary, ship things, etc. How much do I love this hotel? IT belongs to the Kimpton hotel group. I will now check the Kimpton directory when I travel to other cities, and hope that it meets the standards set by the Palomar. On a return visit to San Fran, I will check this hotel first.", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodstock, GA", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "Audiodoc", "ReviewID": "UR83336443", "Content": "We started our trip on business at Half Moon Bay and stayed at the oh so fabulous Ritz Carlton.

From my several trips to and from the US and to San Francisco, my return this year to this hotel would have been a homecoming... NOT! What used to be the Hotel Palomar noted for being a boutique luxury hotel was terribly terribly all wrong. Perhaps it had something to do with a travel agent in the Philippines using another travel agent in the US, booking this hotel for me. I was charged $380 per night for a King Deluxe and breakfast was $35 per head. I eventually found out that continental breakfast was only $14.50 and that if I had booked through the internet, it would have just been $1 breakfast for two. For the last 5 years I had never booked my trips through the travel agency but corporate policies which are still living in the dinosaur ages dictate that we need to go through a travel agent for auditing purposes. Nevertheless, let me say that the King Deluxe was a letdown. There was no water available in the room (you had to buy it at the nearest Walgreens) and the place looked very desolate. The ambience overlooking the awkward looking Zen garden looked sad and pathetic. There was no view. While the room was kept clean by the cleaning lady, there needs to be a makeover and the carpets need to get changed as it smelled musky and moldy. The bathroom was small and the shower curtains (who still uses shower curtains?!?!) were smelly. This was another place in the room that needed a major makeover. Finally was the food. For $14.50 for a continental breakfast, one could get a more decent meal in the next door Westfield Mall for the same price! Talk about having a muffin, some fruits, a croissant, a cup of coffee or fruit juice for this price? There wasn't even yoghurt to go. Geez!! The fitness center was really tiny and you probably are better off jogging in your room than in the tiny place they called Fitness Center. Of course, coming from Sofitel Los Angeles last July and comparing what Sofitel offered and the price I paid for Hotel Palomar was a no brainer. I expect to get what I paid for and if this is what this hotel offers at this price, this must be really the signs of the times in the US...that they are in recession and will stay this way for a decade more with no more cash to upgrade their hotels and provide people with rooms worth their money.

Then there's the parking situation which devaluated this property even more. We ended up paying $48 PER DAY - For two days.

Most cost a little less. For me, the slightly higher rate for the Palomar was worth it. It's not a true luxury hotel, so don't go there expecting something extraordinary; if you're content with a basic, comfortable room, you can find many at a lower rate. But at the Palomar, my room was definitely larger than average. Although I don't spend a lot of time in my hotel rooms, over a period of several days a small room can feel cramped. The bed was fine, the decor was understated and classy. Everything was clean. Flat screen TV with DVD player, mp3-player clock radio, mini bar, bathrobes and umbrella in the closet along with an iron, selection of good newspapers. The bathroom was average--nothing remarkable, but no problems with the shower or anything else (not always the case in my experience; sometimes showers are cramped, or the shower head is too low, or the water turns hot and cold by itself). I was on the seventh floor, and although the windows were covered by plate plexiglass, which dampened exterior noise from the busy street below, I could hear an occasional honk or dumpster routine in the middle of the night. But it was relatively quiet; I've been to many hotels in the area at which dumpsters being emptied in the middle of the night have made sleep impossible; not so here. It has a free wine hour in the evening. The location--around the corner from Market Street--is a matter of personal preference. It's a short walk to Union Square, but there are many hotels a few blocks closer. I always use the BART, so I liked having the station a minute from the hotel, instead of ten minutes. I was particularly impressed by the service. Each and every one of the people I dealt with at the front desk was extremely helpful as well as friendly. I got a good recommendation for a breakfast place nearby, and the staff person called to make sure it was serving before I walked over. I had a problem with my check at the hotel bar (under separate management) and the hotel took care of it without any hassle at all. I The doorman always wished me a nice day and asked if I wanted transportation, but he was never pushy. The room was cleaned unobtrusively.

The mattress pad was strapped on but it was much too small for the king size bad. Honestly, it was also paper thin. As brought up by one of the reviews, I had expected more. If not a pillow top (which is what I would expect given this is considered a luxury boutique hotel), at least a pad that covers up the mattress. Even more disconcerting was that when house keeping (very cordial and helpful - bless their hearts) came to help remedy the situation, they could not locate a pad that would fit a king size bed. What made it all ok was that the two house keeping staff were very accommodating with my request to pad the mattress with several sheets, which by the way helped to create a nice comfortable padding. I just felt bad that they had to remake my bed at midnight. Where's management in all of this. If this had been an earlier complaint, shouldn't management have already addressed this deficiency?

I travel to Berkeley from Los Angeles frequently on business and usually stay in the Monaco, Prescott or Triton--all Kimpton hotels--in SF. This time I joined my husband, who had been on business, for the weekend. I had once stayed in the Palomar in L.A., which is an outstanding hotel, and I had a special promotional deal, so I decided to book the Palomar. I met my husband on Friday evening at the hotel. We went out to dinner nearby and thought we would go to the bar to talk for about an hour at around 10:15. We were told that the manager had decided to close the bar early because the restaurant did not have much business, so it was the last call, but there was a mini bar in our room. That was not the point. Rather surprising for a supposedly full service hotel. This would never happen at the other Kimpton hotels I've stayed in. The room was certainly comfortable and adequate, though the bathroom was small. There was no \"do not disturb\" sign for the door. At 8:30AM the next morning the minibar person came knocking and woke us up. We asked for a sign to be put in our room when we left the hotel later on. When got back the sign was put on the door so housekeeping had not made it up by 6PM! It really was odd that the person did not have the common sense to realize that putting the sign on the door would produce this result. It took two hours to get housekeeping to come, by which time we left for dinner.( Earlier that day I asked the front desk make us a dinner reservation at nearby Fringale. They said they would. An hour later I came down to find they forgot, but they eventually made it.) A complimentary half bottle of wine was left as an apology for all this, which was nice and was appreciated as a gesture, but the poor service started again the next morning--Sunday. Housekeeping came by at 8AM on Monday and started banging doors and talking loudly, so we could not sleep. I then discovered that housekeeping had not left a shower cap or soap the previous day. When we checked out, the front desk gave us someone else's bill, misspelled my husband's name and had charged us for parking. (We had no car.)It took three tries before an accurate bill was produced. What was really appalling was the lack of professionalism on the part of the staff. They were without apology and sort of shrugged their shoulders indifferently. Many seem as if they are young kids with little training. The hotel's location is great, but I would not stay here again. If you want excellent and courteous service, try in this order for a Kimpton in SF: Monaco, Prescott, Triton, and the Monaco has a lovely restaurant and nice bar.

The front desk staff has always been perfectly obliging and the one time I needed a cot for my room for a temporary guest, it was delivered as ordered, on time and without surcharge. They've also always granted my request to be assigned a non-smoking (I'm very particular about that) room far from the elevators, the ice machine and any vending machines, preferably at the end of the corridor so I don't have to deal with drunk, late-night revelers who like to have conversations at the top of their lungs at 3am in the morning. The free in-room WiFi access has always been up to snuff (I'm a data network engineer/designer) and I have no complaints. The location only two blocks away from the Moscone Center complex is invaluable when one needs to drop off a heavy load of computers before heading out to dinner with colleagues and is close enough even for the quick freshening up before dinner or even a quick nap! I only have two major quibbles. Firstly, that they don't always publish their special rates far enough ahead of time even on their own reservations portal (I'm a Kimpton In-Touch member and I sometimes book two months or more ahead of a stay) and really hate leaving things to the last minute so I end up booking with other hotels because the Palomar's regular rate is astronomical and I always look for their special rates (usually a difference between $400-500/night versus $140-190/night). Secondly, the Fifth Floor restaurant is high end but it also has portions at \"high-end sizes\" (i.e., you need to either be a stick-thin supermodel that eats like a bird or you have to order two complete meals just to not starve to death). The two times I've dined there, I've almost had to whip out a magnifying glass to see the portions. The following are not quibbles but just statements of fact. Sometimes, the rooms I've been assigned have been about the size of a postage stamp but I don't care because I spend 99% of my waking time outside of it anyway and so long as it's quiet (it always is) when I need to sleep or do some work, I'm fine with it. Other times, I've had rooms big enough to accommodate another full-sized bed in there. Without exception, the furniture has always been functional and perfectly comfortable and I love their soaps (unlike at other hotels in the SF area, their's doesn't leave a sticky film on my body after using them). Colors of the rooms and corridors are generally muted but that's also what I want because I want tranquil colors when I'm about to rest, not something jarring and dazzling to wake me up--for that I can always drink coffee! Room staff has always been adequate possibly because I am sufficiently multilingual to speak to many of them in their own language. Being a polyglot helps when you would like that extra touch. I've never ordered room service because I tend to dine out and not want to be limited by the menu offerings.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge UK", "Title": "\u201cWhat fun we had\u201d", "Author": "tessajane", "ReviewID": "UR54520275", "Content": "We are three ladies in our 50s who travelled to San Francisco for Thanksgiving.

Our luxury King room was small and came equipped with Zebra and Tiger striped bath robes, in room safe, a flat screen tv, small table and two chairs, clock radio with ipod dock and large mirror on the wall. One thing missing that most hotels seem to have, is the latch across the front of the entrance door, although it does have a deadbolt. Also attached, is a large bathroom complete with small corner shower, with barely enough room to turn around in, and a 4 ft. HIGH not wide jetted tub. Not sure how anyone could climb into that using the small step below the faucet. Also not sure why the shower stall is so small given the size of the bathroom. The hotel is located in the hub of San Francisco - close to Union Square, all kinds of shops, restaurants, and transportation, but difficult to find if you\u2019re not familiar with the area and what to look for. We had to circle the block a few times, in the dark, before we found it. Pretty scary considering the kinds of people on the streets at midnight, and the amount of police cars on those streets. It\u2019s located 5 floors above a storefront, with only a small, canopied, entranceway, and a practically non-existent lobby. Look for the hotel\u2019s sign 5 floors above street level. The rooms are pretty noisy. We could hear people talking loudly in the hallway. Almost felt like they were in the room with us. We could hear toilets flushing, tubs being filled up, water flowing, etc. The noise from the street at night too is unbelievable. We couldn\u2019t sleep with all the sirens from police cars, fire trucks, and honking at night. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t provide details or feedback on the rest of the hotel, as we arrived close to midnight and checked out before 8 a.m. the following morning.

I booked through Travelzoo, so I don't know if that had anything to do with the lack of service I received. There are many amazing pluses about this hotel. It has a great location, the rooms are beautiful, and they have ice cream in the afternoon, and a happy hour. Now for the negatives. We arrived at around 3:00 p.m. and promptly checked in. We had been up since 4 a.m. and were dying to take a nap in the luxurious linens. There happened to be a band playing right outside the window (which is not the hotel's fault) and it was so loud that we could not sleep. Hoping that the front desk had ear plugs, I called down and was met with a lukewarm response. \"Uh, I don't know if we have any, but if we do I will send some up\". So I got up and got dressed and waited for the ear plugs. Thirty minutes later, no ear plugs, and the band was still pounding. I called down again to the desk. \"They are bringing them up right now\". So I stayed dressed for another 30 minutes. No ear plugs. So I finally gave up. I wouldn't mind if they didn't have earplugs, but then they shouldn't repeatedly say that they do and then not send them to the room. My other issue is with the bath. I purposely booked a luxury king with the Fugi soaking tub, because I love to take baths while on vacation. According to their web site: \"four feet deep Fuji Spa tub with a Tub Menu for a personalized bathing experience.\" I thought, \"this is the ultimate tub experience!\". So again I called down to the front desk and mentioned that on their website says that with the luxury king there is a tub menu, and asked what does that include? The young man at the front desk said, \"Uh, look in the orange booklet, it tells you how to use the tub\". I say, \"well, your website mentions a \"tub menu\" with bath products.\" Young man: \"well we might have bath salts here at the front desk, I will send some up.\" I think great, I will have a bath before I leave.\" So guess what they send up? A bar of soap, which I already have in the bathroom. So would I recommend this hotel? Yes, but with some reservations.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "phoenix, arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, awesome service!\u201d", "Author": "gypsytraveler01", "ReviewID": "UR33877536", "Content": "Just stayed at the Palomar and had a wonderful experience.

The rooms though are gorgeous. The theme in my room was 'animal print' done in a really subtle, elegant way. The carpet, bed spread and furniture had a tasteful animal print (all one colour) that was really subtle and designery looking and must have cost a fortune. There was tacky leopard skin print underwear (both male and femaie) for sale in the closet along with matching robes. That was fun and interesting. Huge TV, iPod centre, nice minibar, complimentary newspaper and nice toiletries. The place is just so luxurious with fabulously comfortable beds. I ordered coffee to my room and it cost $15. I like a place to have a bit of a buzz and this hotel doesn't have it. There's no focal point for people so it feels a bit dead sometimes. The up side of this is that it feels really private.

The reception staff were so friendly and very efficient that straight away our tiredness from travelling slipped away and we soon felt suitably refreshed to go straight out and start exploring San Francisco. The room was very spacious and met/exceeded expectations regarding decor and fitments and the bed was huge and probably the most comfortable that we have slept in. The room was also very quiet \u2013 there was no noise to be heard from inside or outside of the hotel at any point during our stay. The design, style and cleanliness of hotel bathrooms are so often a good indication of the general standard of the rest of a given hotel \u2013 we could not fault our bathroom in any way. Free WiFi was much appreciated. The hotel is within 100m of the Powell Street BART station, so, ideal for transport from/to the airport. It is also right next to stops on Market Street for the street cars and almost opposite a cable car stop (across Market Street) which were both great for travelling around the city. We were put off other hotels by reviews that we read which mentioned that they were in or near less desirable areas of the city which raised concerns about safety but we had no problems at all at the Palomar in this respect. The daily wine tasting in the reception area was a nice idea but we were a little disappointed that the person manning the desk, although very pleasant, was not at all knowledgeable about the wine that they were serving other than reading the label on the bottle whether it was a Merlot, Shiraz, Chardonnay etc. Considering California is a major world wine producer it would be have been good to have been told a little more detail about the wines being offered. At all other times when we needed information or assistance we found the reception staff to be extremely knowledgeable and so willing to help make our stay in San Francisco such a pleasant experience.

The rooms have all been redone and the bathrooms are on the small side but new and clean. I loved the l'Occitane shea butter toiletries and the animal print robes (could have done without the pj's for sale in the closet, though) and the room was peaceful for being in such a busy location. I know this will be the third time I mention wine in this review, but I just have to reiterate what a treat the wine reception each evening was- someone refilling your glass with local vignobles while you kick back in the leather armchairs of the restaurant lounge in dim lighting- I can't think of a more perfect way to unwind after a long day of business meetings and before an evening of work dinners. Having stayed in numerous other hotels in SF (Renaissance, Le Meridien, Westin St. Francis, Grand Hyatt, to name a few) I can say that if you prefer a boutique atmosphere this will beat out all of them (except maybe the St. Regis, to be fair :)...

The hotel is in a fantastic location, right off Market Street and close to Union Square. We booked a great rate through Orbitz and paid $160 per night. Check-in was fast. The room was fairly basic but clean. It's very similar in style to the W Hotel brand. The bathrooms are a bit dated and could stand to be renovated. Our room was on a lower floor, near the elevators, and did not have much of a view. We would've preferred a better room but I'm sure the low rate we paid had an impact on our placement. The complimentary wi-fi in the rooms is a nice touch. There's no real lobby bar (or even much of a lobby) due to its layout. We usally like to have a couple drinks at the hotel we're staying out before we go out to dinner or after a long day of sightseeing. Service at the hotel was great. The staff is younger and very friendly. We checked in on New Year's Eve and the staff suggested walking down to the Embaradero to watch fireworks which was a great idea. We had lunch at the Slanted Door in the Ferry Building and would definitely recommend it. It always has great food and nice atmosphere. There's always a wait there so make reservations if you know you want to eat there. On our last night, the concierge made a reservation for us at North Beach Restaurant and got us a town car service for transportation. Great food and speedy service (maybe even a little too quick if you're looking for a leisurely meal). During the meal, my partner noticed he had misplaced his cell phone, possibly in the car. When we arrived back at the hotel, the doorman asked if we had lost a phone and produced it immediately. Very nice touch! I'd recommend the hotel if you're looking for something that's reasonably priced, in a great location, and has a little bit of style.

Last year I booked a room at the Palomar in San Francisco and have since made it my preferred hotel in that city. The SF Palomar is NOT glamorous. It may have been when it first opened but it is now definitely showing its age. The decor is firmly rooted in a mid-1990's aesthetic. Nonetheless, it is well maintained and I still find the lobby (except for the battered sofa) and elevator vestibules to be quite attractive. The rooms could use an update. They are very comfortable but definitely bland. The cream-colored walls really wash-out the rooms and no amount of brightly colored accessories can alleviate the drabness. And that's pretty much the only negative I have for the place. The rooms may be dull in decor--and a bit too snug at times--but the comfort factor is high. The beds and linen encourages one to sleep-in on rainy San Francisco mornings. The bathrooms are non-descript, but they work and I've always had plenty of hot water when I needed it. Housekeeping is gracious (Marina leaves me cute notes) and very efficient. The picture windows in the rooms facing Market Street are well insulated against the noise generated by the pandemonium below. However, those who are particularly sensitive to outside noise may prefer one of the inside rooms; they have an almost tomb-like quality. The location is great. The Pal is right on the corner of Market and 4th, just a very short walk away from the epicenter of the best shopping on the west coast. If you're lucky, you'll get one of the precious few outside rooms. The windows are huge and it's fun watching all the scurrying below; society ladies with Armani bags, protesters, backpackers, Buddhist monks, guys in drag, street performers, investment bankers, and seemingly every other example of humanity all collide together right outside the hotel. Another big plus is that the Powell Street MUNI/BART station is right around the corner from the Palomar's entrance. The Pal is great for museum junkies (like me); the spectacular DeYoung is a MUNI ride away and the Museum of Modern Art is just a ten minute walk from the Pal's doors. The Palomar has an interesting advantage in that it's located next door to the Westfield Mall. During my first few visits to the hotel, the staff would direct me to the Westfield's food court when I asked where I could get a quick bite to eat. I initially scoffed at the idea of getting a meal at a food court but this is no ordinary food court. The Korean BBQ joint is quick, cheap, and so very delicious. Corriander, right next to it, has wonderful Thai food at bargain prices. I truly enjoy grabbing a meal at the Westfield food court and bringing it back to my room to watch a movie (the rooms at the Palomar are equipped with DVD players.) One time I asked one of the front desk people (I shall not name the person) about room service; the person just shook his head and mouthed the words \"You don't want to do that.\" That pretty well sums up the quality of the Palomar's room service. The Pal has a very formal restaurant called the Fifth Floor. It's very good but for a truly awesome meal in an achingly romantic setting ask Stephen, the concierge, to get you reservations at Chez Spencer. Which brings me to the Palomar's most shining asset: the staff. These people are no corporate drones; they are charming, wacky, funny, and vibrant. They are also very competant at what they do. I'm away from home quite a bit and almost always travel by myself; it is such a luxury to walk into a hotel and be welcomed back as an old friend. Overall, if you want up-to-date style go to the W. If you need pampered luxury--and are willing to pay dearly for it--go to the Mandarin Oriental. The Palomar is for those who place comfort above trendy luxury and who appreciate a warm, welcoming staff.

The staff at the front desk were very friendly. The location is very good, close to the shopping area, Moscone Center and BART Powell station. My only complaint is about the lobby, which is small and cold. I didn't have dinner at the restaurant. The breakfast was okay, but I prefer a self-service breakfast. C.K.

We chose the Hotel Palomar based on other TripAdvisor reviews. Good choice. We had two rooms--atrium room was very light and quiet. Street rooms are noisy on lower floors; fine above five or six. Atrium room and bath was exceptionally large; other was small and tight with two beds. Handicapped bathroom was without a walk or roll in shower. However, the excess of grab bars made it useable. The staff ARE very attentive. We especially enjoyed and visited with the Head Bell Man, the doormen and the security men on in the evenings. Because we were there a full week they got to know us, and our comings and goings. They made the best suggestions. Concierge service was adequate, but not very experienced or with first hand knowledge. Often they relied on reports or questions from prior guests all stored in the hotel computer. They did suggest a 12 person van tour of the wine country for us that I also recommend--Pacific Tours. Although the hotel was short-staffed in housekeeping, what ever we asked for at the front desk was promptly received or corrected--too few bath towels for two, more soap, change the hypoallergic pillows, etc. Yes the low flush toilets are noisy...they all are. Yes the lobby is minimal--but there is a lovely quiet sitting area on the fifth floor which we used nightly for business meetings. We could even have a drink or order soup or lite fare during our meetings. My mom sat out there with a friend one day while the room was being made up. Yes, the restaurant is pricey. But it is totally in line with any other top flight restaurant in SF. It is rated THE BEST French restaurant in the city. Nearby is Annabelle's which is reasonable and the food is very good. Note Annabelle's has a restaurant and a bar menu that are totally different. Also nearby in the Westfield Mall is a food court with all types of ethnic and uncommon fare at low or more typical SF prices. In the mornings we used the hotel car service to go to our work location. Ideal with our brief cases and computers, we went door to door at low cost and maximum convenience. That should be arranged with the door man in advance. The service is first come first serve on weekdays. Our rooms were exceptionally clean, comfortable, and the location cannot be beat.

The lofty ambiance of the restaurant did not match the pedestrian design of the hotel rooms. The location is excellent if you want to be near SOMA and Union Square. However, if you know San Francisco, the hotel's location on Market Street means that you will encounter the street people that are an integral part of the fabric of this city.

The Westfield Shopping Center is right next door. I am not a shopping-type person but that is a must-see. What a gorgeous mall!!

Last month I finally got around to staying there. From SF International Airport to the center of town you can take a cab, a shuttle, a bus or BART. I chose the Bay Area Rapid Transit System (BART) as my method of reaching central San Franciso because all I had to drag on wheels was my carry-on bag. The fare was $5.10 or $5.20. It takes half an hour. As you go up the esculator from the Powell Street station you can see the sign for the Palomar. Can't beat that. Half a block walk and you are there. Map it online ahead of time. I was early for my reservation but the staff got me directed to my room. It faced away from the street and over a glass atrium. It was also a bit cramped. I could be in any hotel in the country with this view. I went back to the lobby and asked for a better room. For $20.00 a night more I got a slightly larger room that overlooked Market Street, a main San Franciso street. Granted I did hear some street musicians through the window in the evening but stuff like this stops at around 10 PM. I had three quiet nights of sleep. I can't say enough nice things about the staff. Want an opinion about a restaurant? You can get several. It happens that the historic, reasonably priced John's Grill is only a couple of blocks away. As for the room again. It was clean. No walk-in shower but a nice bath. Nice, light cover for the bed so you can see how clean it is. Kind of weird to have two desk chairs. Great if you are going to have a couple of visitors to your room. Reading lights for bed reading could be better (as with most hotels). Mattress was comfortable as were the pillows. NY Times delivered to the door. At check out I was told I could have gotten a SF paper if I had told them.

When we first arrived, a bevy of 3 or 4 people ran up to help us. The staff paid special attention to my daughter, who's 7. The desk clerk actually encouraged her to jump on the bed, and the doorman jokingly chided her for not wearing a jacket.

The room was quite large and attractive, and the beds very comfortable. We were on the 8th floor and had a very nice view across Market Street and up toward Union Square. The L'Occitane amenities are nice, too. The location is really fantastic--BART and MUNI stop downstairs, great shopping is steps away, and SFMOMA and other museums are just a short walk away. I don't like this hotel quite as much as another Kimpton Hotel in SF, the Argonaut, but the Palomar's location is superior (unless you want to be at Fisherman's Wharf). The room was quiet in that we didn't hear a peep from neighboring rooms or the hallway. However, at 8pm a band set up across the street, and it was quite audible, even through the double-paned windows. We didn't mind, but if you don't want to hear Jimi Hendrix tunes until 11 pm (plus the occasional siren and other street noise) ask for an interior room. I only have a couple small complaints. 1. The bathroom has a pocket door. These seem to be popular in SF hotels, but I don't like them. 2. The lobby, although attractive, is small.

Our package even included 2 bottles of soda, popcorn and a $20 hmv coupon to buy cds/dvds. Our room faced the internal court yard, so it was quite quiet in the evening. In addition, it was quite large, well appointed and looked like it was in pretty decent condition (not like some of the other reviews). I can only conclude that the conditions of the rooms vary. Location: This was main reason we stayed at the Palomar, since we were only spending 3 days in SF, 1 min. walking distance to Union Square is very important. Just check out where it is located on the map. Only complaint, which is a bit hard to avoid in sf, is some of the rif-rafts around the area, but I understand it's even worse closer to Union Square station. Anyways never really had any problems. Service: It was okay, not great not bad. The doorman was extremely nice and helpful, however they took more than 15 mins to retrieve our luggage, which almost caused us to miss our transfer to the airport.

Another taxi to another airport, bad traffic, not enough time to check in; but I managed somehow, only to end up in the very back row next to a woman with a coughing brat in her lap. I got to the Palomar at 11:15am. I stopped in, figuring I'd at least drop my bag and use a men's room. The clerk at the front desk asked how she could help me, so I asked if it were possible to check in, explaining that I knew it was very early, etc. While she was checking, she asked how my morning was going--so I told her the story. Well the room they had set aside for me wasn't ready, so she upgraded me. And I had half an hour to relax in a deluxe room before going to the meeting.

Finally when you book online via travelocity you get a good deal, and also get tonnes of spam, just be sure you use an email you dont care about. Travelocity, naughty naughty, you spammed me, and sold my email to make money did you not? Tut tut, will not book through you next time for that, so I hope you learn next time.

One annoyance was the lack of a proper dresser or bureau the only piece of storage furniture being the TV armoire which also housed the mini bar, books, etc. The bathroom was just \"ok\". A couple annoyances, while access to public transport is nice, there is a prominent stop right in front of the hotel so quite often during the day the sidewalk is packed with people waiting for the bus, also the housekeeping service started out ok, but slowly became more inconsistent as the week unfolded. The front desk staff were very helpful, attentive and able to answer most questions I had about the city, etc. Free WiFi, a pay option at most hotels of comparable quality in the area, was nice as well.

We chose the Palomar and Harbor Court hotels, and according to TripAdvisor, they were similar in traveler satisfaction. That was certainly not our experience, and we wished we had stayed at the Palomar the entire trip. The Palomar has the best staff of any hotel we have ever visited. Everyone, from the bell desk to concierge was friendly, professional, and knowledgable. I booked a Executive King through the hotel's website and when we checked in we had been upgraded to Room 816, which was a beautiful room with large windows that overlooked the street. I was concerned at first that the noise from the street would be bothersome but it wasn't. At night we didn't hear anything and slept great. The bathroom was very nice, with thoughtful amenities like a magnifying makeup mirror and ample room to put personal belongings. The room was very comfortable and the decor was beautiful, but also fun, with leopard print carpeting. The bed was very comfortable with high quality bed linens. There were four bed pillows, something we really appreciated. A pretty room means nothing to us, though, if the hotel staff isn't what it should be. The staff is great, we felt welcome and pampered from the minute we walked in. I used the concierge (Yeme) several times and she gave us great advice and was so very nice. We also asked directions several times and the bell desk was helpful and accurate. The location is great, and we didn't rent a car while we were there. We walked everywhere, or took public transportation which is easily accessible. A couple of tips that are very important - if you plan to visit Alcatraz, be sure to buy your tickets through blueandgoldfleet[\"\"]ahead of time. There were many people trying to get tickets and they couldn't - sold out. Also, if you want to take a wine tour and plan to use a tour company or limo, it would be best to choose the company ahead of time and make reservations. The company we wanted to use (recommended by Yeme) was sold out for the weekend, so we had to go with someone else. It was ok, glad we did it, but the other would have been better.

Positives: - Location is perfect, a few blocks away from Union Square, less than a block away from Sony Metreon and San Francisco Shopping Center. - We are big on Customer Service, so that is the first thing that we noticed when we arrived. Everyone was friendly and very approachable. They always greeted us with a big smile and was willing to help. - During our check in, we were upgraded to a Suite without even asking. Perhaps because we are members of the Kimpton? They also greeted us with a welcome bag which consisted of a bottle of distiled water and an apple. It's not a big thing, but it's a nice gesture. - We have stayed at many different hotels in San Francisco, but we have never encountered hotel rooms so quiet before. We were on the 8th floor and we could not hear the busy streets at all. We were expecting to hear a lot of noises, (I even had my earplugs ready) so this was a nice surprise. Some of the problems we encountered during our stay: - I usually don't use shampoo and conditioners provided by Hotels, but Kimpton usually provides great amentines, so I decided not to bother to bring my own. The shampoo (Aveda) really dried up my hair. Not a big deal really, for I was smacked in the middle of downtown, an easy walk to get my regular shampoo. - The pillows were small. We are used to having either queen/king size pillows on a king size bed, but these pillows provided were the standard pillows. They were so small that they looked out of place on such a large bed. - The bathroom was nice, and the tub was big enough, however, the water in the tub took forever to drain. In fact, the water reached my ankle when I was taking a shower. We let the hotel know about this, but we were encountering the same problems the whole time we were there. The toilet wasn't flushing properly also. We had to flush at least twice or three times each time.

Ultimately, the staff makes a stay at a hotel matter - and they were all above and beyond my expectations. The hotel partners with a limo service that was fantastic - which is another great suggestion in touring the city and beyond. Money well spent. The doormen will arrange the service for you. I booked a king and upgraded to a suite on the 9th floor - which was divine. If you need the room to spread out and enjoy the view, do it. And after walking all over the city all day, the jacuzzi tub and the shower take away all your aches and pains. And if you don't have the energy to get back out for dinner, or you want a good breakfast to start off the day right - the restaurant's food is great. A little on the high-end price wise, but it's convenient. The bed was wonderful, the room service was great and it was quiet and peaceful when I retired for the night.

Maybe I'm not quite as \"picky\" as other people, but I found the customer service at the hotel to be excellent, as compared to the 200+ other hotels I've stayed at in the last 12 months. Apparently the hotel was good enough to win the \"Conde Nast\" Traveler's 2005 Gold List of World's Best Places to stay, so I guess I'm not alone in thinking that it's a nice place to stay. Being a \"road warrior\", I'm also an \"Inner Circle Elite Member\", so it's possible I get treated a little better than the average customer, but compared with my treatment at other chains (Intercontinental, Marriott, Starwood), I found the customer service to be more than adequate. Checkin: I arrived early at the hotel (approx 1 PM), and didn't expect to be given a room, but the desk clerk found one for me without a problem. Based on my \"Inner Circle\" status, I asked if I could get upgraded. Again, based on past experiences with equal status at other chains, I was more than prepared to accept a negative response. The desk clerk upgraded me to a jacuzzi suite, no extra charge. She was very friendly, smiling, and welcoming, traits that I unfortunately see a paucity of in the hotel business. Room Service: I believe that room service at most Kimpton hotels is not quite at the same level as larger hotels, because they are boutique hotels, which are smaller in scale by definition than main chain hotels. That said, I think the quality of food I've ordered at Kimptons hotels exceeds their rivals. I did have breakfast at the hotel restaurant, and though expensive, it really was not any more than rival hotels (esp. for San Francisco). Service was fast and good, so no problems there. Room: Clean, with relatively new appearing furniture (again, maybe I'm just not as picky as others - but I do stay in enough hotels to be able to judge quality of room accomodations). The bathroom had a jacuzzi with separate walk-in shower with Aveda toiletries. Overall: Considering I booked the room with a Travelzoo discount of 150 (with $25 discount towards restaurant meal), I would most definitely stay there again. And the friendly, welcoming staff was the icing on the top which is the feature that would lead me to stay there again. I think that the same Travelzoo offer also has free parking for those driving, and may be running through March (on the weekend).

Quirk #1: I do NOT want a bell hop to touch my luggage I do NOT wnat a bell hop to 'push my trolley\" I do NOT want a bell hop to even know my name I am paying for the facilities of the hotel - the trolley is part of these facilities - I should not have a bell hop tell me that I cannot use the bloody trolley. If I say I want to ferry my luggage to my room myself using the trolley then that s my perogotive - LET ME. Quirk #2: I do NOT want a valet to touch my car I accept that I generally have to tolerate this and so, when I do so, and I pay for parking as well as tipping the valet - then, when I call down for my car at 7:30PM then 1) The concierge should answer the phone 2) When I call the front desk and ask for my car they shouldn't tell me \"take a number\" 3) It shouldn't take 25 minutes for them to get my car (NOTE: only one other car was brought in that 25 minutes and the next day - they had it within 5 minutes). Quirk #3: We selected the hotel because it was \"pet friendly\". A pet friendly hotel should allow me to leave my pet in the room if I feel that doing so was safe and I am willing to take the responsibility. There was no indication of the requirement for attending my dog at all times until check in (not quite bait and switch as they don't tell -how- friendly they are). We had to take the dog with us - to our event requiring that we leave her in the car, further requiring that we drive rather than take a taxi, and eliminating the need to go to the drink-and-dance party as remaining 100% sober is the only way to drive. When I travel to europe, to a little burgh along the Rhine then I get better service knowing that there is no service available rather than feeling that the service is available and isn't. When I travel to Singapore to a luxury hotel none of the issues raised above had been near visible - much less than occuring. When I travel to Mobile Alabama I get treated better... In the future I will opt for the motels further away from the location of the event and take three rooms for the price of the luxury hotel be able to walk to the resturaunts for evening meal - leave my dog in the room and pay nothing for parking, need no valet, use the trolley all I want with no bleeding bell hop to tell me that I cannot ferry my own luggage to my room.", "Date": "February 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cI wish I could have stayed longer\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4455870", "Content": "The Hotel Palomar is fabulous.

Here's my thoughts on it: - Once you have done your looking around online and found what you think is the best deal, go to the Palomar website and see what they are charging for the exact same type o room. If you call the number for reservations or go to the Kimpton Group website you can see they have a \"best rate guaranteed\" deal where they match the rate you found plus you get late checkout times and a room upgrade if available. The room upgrade is probably a little iffy according to other reviews on this site, but it did work for us. We booked a King Deluxe (their base room) and were upgraded to a Executive King room which is slightly larger and faces out rather than looking at the inner courtyard. The room is still not overly large (350 square feet) but the view was nice (Market Street, with Macy's etc. in view). I should mention that I wrote an email to the reservations people at the hotel asking for a room upgrade as well so not sure if the upgrade happened as a resut of the Kimpton guarantee or my email. Still, well worth a try. We got ours for $200 U.S. a night including all taxes which while not a huge steal was decent. - Hotel location is pretty decent, located right in the middle of the shopping district and centrally located for any touristy things you are plannin on doing. The one thing I would say is that while the immediate neighbourhood is good, SF has a big problem with homeless people and you will often see them in front of the hotel. This is true everyhere in the downtown area so not a big deal but still a little unsettling. It was always relieving to have the doormen open the oor for you as you approach and escape into the lobby. - Service was fine for us, though we didn't ask for very much. We checked in late in the evening with no problem and the bellhop was very friendly and informative. The desk staff were polite but never seemed to go out of their way to say hello as you walk by or anything. Maids were friendly and said hi and smiled whenever they saw you. - Design and decor was great. It is a beautiful hotel if you are into modern style and some nice luxury touches. There was nothing in our room that turned me off the place. I hate when you stay at a hotel and it seems nice but then you notice scuff marks on the wall or cracks in the bathroom tiles and so on. The king bed was super comfortable though if you or your partner are a restless sleeper it might be problematic as it was somewhat springy and when my girlfriend would turn over, I would bounce a little on my side. That said, it was a great sleep with wonderful linens and pillows. One of the best beds I have slept in, in a hotel. The TV was fine and the Sony CD player was very nice with some music and a light jazz station coming in very clearly. The bathroom does lack a little bit in privacy as it is a sliding door that does not latch or close. It is not see through or anything but when the bed is right beside the bathroom door you may hear more noises when someone uses it then you would prefer. If you aren't shy though, no problem! - Overall it was a pretty good experience. If we returned to San Francisco I would probably stay there again, though I would be tempted to stay in a different part of the city.

We stayed for 5 nights and I celebrated my 30th birthday there. We did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food but found it be ideal for our needs, perfectly situated, modern and clean and the staff were excellent. We turned up out of the blue one day with a couple of bicycles we had hired and they kindly helped us to store these for a couple of nights. Staff recommended places to go and eat and were pleasant and helpful at all times particularly when it came for us to hire a car, they provided a map and directions to our next destination - Lake Tahoe. Our last night we booked to stay at the far more expensive Parc 55 hotel and it was appalling. Situated right on the edge of the rough part of town, Tenderloin. If you want a large grand fancy lobby with crap service, small dirty rooms and staff who are uninterested and barely speak English then I strongly recommend Parc 55. If however, you want a clean, stylish and tranquil place to relax then the Palomar will be right up your street. I cannot recommend the hotel highly enough. I wish so much we had booked in here for the last night of our holiday and would not hesitate to return.", "Date": "June 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cFour star location, one star service\u201d", "Author": "RStokes", "ReviewID": "UR2218005", "Content": "The palomar is an elegant hotel with a good central downtown location.

In that I love boutique hotels, this was another pleasant surprise in the heart of downtown San Francisco (my fav being the Pan Pacific). These rooms were much larger, and although the bathroom was not as elegant as the Pan, the Fuji bathtub was wonderful - so good for soaking the feet after hitting the streets all day. I filled it to the brim knowing that I was depleting the world of water!! It was very very relaxing. The room was a bit too contemporary for me, but did not detract from my stay. I have two complaints about the room. The way our suite was set up, you couldn't sit on the sofa and look directly at the t.v. You had to lay on the sofa to be head-on with the t.v. Also, there are no coffee making faciliites. In a room that is over $400/night, you would expect to find such a convenience - after all...you get that in the $59/night Best Western! My big gripe with the area, not the hotel, is that you are in downtown San Francisco, and there are few good restaurants around, so it's either order from room service or go to the bistro down the street (and by the way, room service gets its food from the bistro down the street). So if you are going to stay at the Palomar, keep that in mind. You will either have to go to the financial or theater district or go elsewhere. If you DO get to Fisherman's Wharf, eat at Scoma's - they have the best (albeit expensive) seasfood going! I'd stay at the Paloma again, but before I'd go back, I'd stay at the Hotel Monaco - it's sister hotel (both are pet-friendly by the way). BY THE WAY - SKIP THE COURTYARD ROOMS. All you see is 3 other interior walls and you look down through a glass roof into \"Old Navy.\" This is a gripe I almost forgot. We got to the hotel early and stowed our luggage and went to get lunch (see note above about eateries in the area) and do some shopping. We hiked all the way to Chinatown before finding any place for lunch - the hotels in the area do not have coffee shops! Anyway, the front desk told us to be back at 2 pm, and we were, and our room still wasn't ready. The staff said that the people were still checking out. They had us wait in the 5th floor loung, very very dark- no coffee pot, no water, no nothing but couches & lounge chairs. 45 minutes later, I sent my husband to complain. The front desk said the couple had spilled something on the carpet & they were cleaning it up, and did we want an \"interior\" room instead. DO NOT GET AN INTERIOR ROOM (see note above). If we had been given our exterior room, we would have been able to sit there and watch the St. Patrick's Day parade on Sunday. The view stunk. All in all, maybe I won't go back there again. I think I'll stay down by the Wharf where there's tons of restaurants & things to do (but I STILL loved that bathtub)!", "Date": "April 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat room, poor service, and fraudulent advertising\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1735334", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel Palomar for 6 nights in March. I found a deal for 137/night on Orbitz and I saw on Palomar's website that they offer to match any internet rate and to include with that a free upgrade to the \"best available room\" (offer has since changed to \"best room in next 'tier.'\" While they honored the rate, the refused to honor the upgrade, even though a quick check on the web showed that better rooms were available. (I read about this exact problem right here on trip-advisor reviews, so I wasn't surprised). They basically said that the room I got WAS an upgrade, because it was an exterior room, instead of an interior room. This is just ridiculous, because their website, on which they promise the upgrade, makes no mention of this distinction. And besides, the deal we were offered said \"best available room,\" not \"slightly better room.\" When I discussed this problem with Brian Fenwick, the general manager, he was rude and unhelpful (another review on this website makes this same point; take note, Kimpton Group!!). He claimed that the website booking system was incorrect about better rooms being available and that I WAS, in fact, in the best available room. Before speaking with Brian, I had a friend call the front desk and try to book a suite; she was informed that they had several suites available. When I told this to Brian, he said that while the rooms may be available to others for booking, but that they were \"allotted,\" so he was unable to upgrade me. This is nonsense. I'm not sure what is more disturbing: that they wouldn't honor the upgrade, or that Brian would tell a bold-faced lie and say the rooms were unavailable. Besides this unpleasantness, the hotel was fine: a nice big room, service once a day (although they say you should get it twice), and a big clean bathroom. Just don't expect the web upgrade deal to be honored.", "Date": "March 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLove the Palomar\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1724637", "Content": "I have had the pleasure to stay at the Palomar on numerous occasions.
