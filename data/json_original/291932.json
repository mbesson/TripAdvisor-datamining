The position, close to Termini station is excellent - only a four minute walk, and with so many small family restaurants and other facilities very close by, it is difficult to fault the location. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful on arrival and offered maps and other useful information on things to do in Rome. Our twin room was okay - nothing more or less than that. There was a tv and a fridge, with a few soft drinks to purchase if required, a double built in wardrobe with a room safe (safe didn't work), an additional put-u-up bed, a chair and two bedside cabinets. The wall coverings were a little scuffed and the carpet was stained and looked old and tired. The beds were comfortable. Although the bathroom was tiny, it was extremely clean and provided with soap and shower liquid. The towels were replaced every day and were very clean, if not particularly thick. Our room was on the 2nd floor at the front of the hotel, so it was noisy. One oddity was that you couldn't walk up the stairs to your room but had to use the lift, which took ages to arrive. The staircase was only useable to walk downstairs as there was a self-closing mechanism on it! The breakfast room is tiny, but pretty. The breakfast is the usual continental fare, but not of a very high quality and not much to choose from, though you wouldn't go hungry. The lounge area is very attractive and there is a lovely roof terrace, but no bar up there. I guess you would have to take up a drink from the little bar in reception. There is a 24 hour coffee/tea etc machine, which was very reasonable. Lots of small family restaurants in the area but we would particularly recommend the one immediately opposite the Windrose Hotel, called La Famiglia.

Despite requesting a double bed at booking, we got twin beds which for some unknown reason couldn't be changed until the next day (despite the fact that cleaning staff were on our floor when we checked in). There was also a strange smell in the bathroom which lingered our whole stay. You could live with this, but it was the breakfast that got us. If you are on holidays and you want a 'feel good' start to your day, then don't eat breakfast here. It was very disappointing (the worst of our three weeks in Italy) - basic food, coffee undrinkable, breakfast staff unfriendly, and if you arrive towards the end of the service, don't expect much of anything. In fact one day we didn't even go down to breakfast, preferring to have brunch out. For Rome the room price was fairly cheap, but then you get what you pay for. Would not stay here again.

Upon checking in, we were surprised how tiny our room and bathroom were, but we expected small rooms in Rome and liked our little balcony and the charming view. In addition, everything had recently been renovated and looked fairly new. We also liked the proximity of the hotel to the train station, which, as big public transportation users, proved extremely convenient. Finally, there is a popular restaurant-La Famiglia--just across the street. (We met a couple from Arizona who flies to Italy several times a year just to eat at this restaurant! They even had New Year's reservations booked. We didn't find the food that good, but the busy atmosphere and family-style seating was nice.) The problem we had--and it's a big one--is the lack of effective responsiveness from the staff. We didn't get to bed during our first night there until 2:30 am. At 5:30 am, we were jolted from a deep sleep by loud pounding--\"BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\" and the shout, \"HOUSEKEEPING!\" This repeated several times--\"BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! HOUSEKEEPING!\" At first, I thought the hotel was on fire and the staff was trying to wake us up and get us out. But my husband didn't think the person shouting was pounding on our door. We got up and looked out into the hall, to find two young, college age Amercian girls pounding on the door next store and shouting. When I informed them they had just woken us up from a dead sleep, the one doing the shouting explained they were \"sorry,\" but their friend \"Pete\" wouldn't let them in to get their \"stuff.\" Apparently, they were trying to trick him into opening the door by posing as Italian hotel staff who just happen to sound exactly like young American girls. Anyway, they were completely unconcerned with our sleep deprivation problem and kept pounding. Unable to figure out how to call the reception desk, my husband got dressed and went down to the night concierge to complain. The night concierge was argumentative, and kept pointing at the monitor to show that no one was visible in the hall, so what could he do? Video cameras are stationed in the hall of each floor of the hotel, but not every room is visible to each camera. Either the loud girls were out of the camera's range, or by the time the night concierge looked at the screen, \"Pete\" had let them in. My husband finally gave up and came back to the room. We finally got to sleep again, when, at 7:30 am, the kids next store resumed their shouting and pounding. I swung open the door to see the same girls standing outside the room, again trying to get \"Pete\" to let them in. I expressed amazement they had woken us up a second time, but they were utterly unfazed. My husband again went down to the reception desk and this time talked to the day concierge, who inexplicably made excuses for the girls (\"perhaps they were just trying to find their friends\"). Taking matters into my own hands, I called the kids' room, explained to \"Pete\" that they had twice woken us up, and asked him to please keep it quiet. He grunted some one syllable sound in response. I then went down to speak to the day concierge myself. He kept reiterating that he had already spoken to my husband, and he could perhaps talk to the kids, but basically, there was nothing he could do. When, responding to my inquiry, he told me the loud kids were booked to be there the same days we were, I asked him if we could change rooms. He agreed, but said I'd need to wait until noon. So, we changed our sightseeing schedule so we could be back at the hotel just a few hours later, and schlepped all our stuff from our third floor room to our new fifth floor room. The fifth floor room was, amazingly, EVEN SMALLER than our previous room; the shower was so tiny we had to turn sideways to get in and even then both the front and back of our bodies scraped the sides of the door; and worse--there was no balcony. While the remainder of our stay was quiet, it was due solely to the luck of having polite and respectful fellow guests on the fifth floor. We were extremely annoyed that the hotel staff failed to take any action whatsoever to ensure we could happily stay in our original room. They expressed no remorse at all, they offered no suggestions or solutions. Rather, they made excuses for the loud kids and clearly just wanted us to shut up and leave them alone. When we returned from Florence on Dec. 2, we arrived again at the Windrose to drop off our luggage. We knew it was too early to check in, but the hotel advertised that people who arrived early could drop off their luggage. My husband approached the reception desk and showed the day concierge our reservation voucher to let him know we had reservations. Seemingly indignant, the day concierge huffed that we couldn't check in until noon. My husband explained that we weren't there to check in, just to drop off our luggage. \"But of course!\" again huffed the seemingly yet inexplicably annoyed day concierge, as if he knew that's why we were there and how could we possibly be so stupid? He had us leave the luggage in the unlocked breakfast area, which made us nervous. After this absurd, 2 minute interaction with this man, who was so rude and condescending over something that shouldn't have been an issue, I couldn't respect myself for giving the Windrose any more of my hard-earned money. So my husband and I went off in search of another hotel. We booked a room at a different, nearby hotel, picked up our luggage, and left. However, afraid the Windrose might charge us anyway, before picking up our luggage we called our credit card company and alerted them that we didn't authorize any further charges from the Windrose. However, the Windrose did charge us for these two nights we didn't stay there, so I am now in the process of disputing the charges.", "Date": "December 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cStay away from this hotel and location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4113337", "Content": "Smallest room on the planet, and dirty on top of it.

There's a busy little restaurant just opposite, a large supermarket further down the street, the 492 bus stops on Via Volturno and the 40 express bus from Termini, so in our opinion, the location is excellent for returning during the day with shopping or just for a rest from sightseeing. We were aprehensive about the Termini area, having read so many different reviews, but The Windrose is far enough away not to be worried. We will certainly stay here again on our next visit to Rome.", "Date": "January 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barry", "Title": "\u201cWhat problems?

Don't waste time haggling for a taxi from the Airport, take the Terrorvision bus service, tickets available from desk inside the Arrivals Terminal. Hotel is a short walk from drop off point at Termini Station. We took a taxi, but there really is no need (we paid 20euros for what was only a 5 min walk). Yes there are homeless people and beggars at the station but not on the Via Gaeta where hotel is situated (safe, quiet street). Hotel is small, very clean and well maintained (as previous feedbacks state). Staff helpful with local information (Metro strike etc). We found it cheaper to get drinks and snacks from the supermarket situated on Via Gaeta rather than at tourist spots (on exiting hotel, turn left, follow road and find supermarket on the corner to your right). This was our first big city break and trip to Rome, it felt very reassuring to go back to the Windrose to relax after long day of sight seeing. I will use this hotel again.", "Date": "December 3, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Tourist Class Hotel\u201d", "Author": "historyhnyb", "ReviewID": "UR2858978", "Content": "Like another reviewer said, do not expect a 5-star hotel. This is a standard tourist class hotel earning all of the 3-stars that it is rated. I stayed in a triple and the rooms were quite comfortable. The breakfast was just enough in the morning to get something in your stomach for a day of sight seeing and walking. The convenience to Termini station could not be beat. One of the highlights of staying at this hotel is the restaurant across the street. Not only is it convenient and reasonably price the food is outstanding. The only complaint I had would be the noise level. Our room was facing the street and it got rather noisy. I would request and interior room or one higher up. I would definitely consider staying here again.", "Date": "December 1, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended- great beds, clean, friendly, good location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2820470", "Content": "Don't expect a 5 star hotel, but this was a very nice place to stay! Clean, very nicely decorated, good location, and the beds were well above average for a good nights sleep. We stayed there just last week (11-2 to 11-9-2004) and it was very nice. Good elevator, friendly front desk service, maid did a great job keeping the room tidy, fresh towels and nothing of our was disturbed. The breakfasts were simple with two choiced dry cereal, milk, rolls, sweet rolls, juices (3), coffee, tea, meat and cheese. and the usual jellies. Lovely little breakfast room too. Bath rooms were lovely, rooms were smallish, but very comfortable. TV didn't get CNN for news fans. Our room faced the front street and the little restaurant across the street had several musicians that would serinade us each evening and we did keep the window open a little even in Nov to hear the music! The restaurant across the street had very good food (particularly the soup!) but you have to watch them cause they rip you off if you don't watch closely. Great double glazed windows on the hotel too! If you closed them you heard very little noice and it's off of a main drag so you don't get the extra traffic. Even with some city noice that you will find in Rome, it was very nice. You can walk nearly anywhere you want to go, but keep in mind you are not in the main city center so you will have to walk. Close to some great shopping too! We have traveled a great deal and found this to be a good choice for the price and recommend it to anyone staying in Rome.", "Date": "November 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warren, MI", "Title": "\u201cEndorsement for Windrose Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2814759", "Content": "I stand by my endorsement of the Windrose Hotel. I stayed there with my daughter in March, 2004 and found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The hotel is spotless, nice, up-dated bathrooms, and in general, very pleasing. It is true that it is not in the nicest area but also not the worst. I love the proximity to all transportation. It's true some things are far; however, you can't be near everything and the bus and subway transportation is so cheap, I do not feel that is a problem.", "Date": "November 9, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Windrose Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d291932-Reviews-Windrose_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$96 - $215*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Gaeta 39</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "291932", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e9/2b/59/la-nostra-struttura.jpg"}}
