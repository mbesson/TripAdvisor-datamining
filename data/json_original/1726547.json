By the hotel there are lots of different kinds of restaurants, from kebab shops to Italian The italian restaurant at the corner of the street is really good and cheap and (for the Italians on holidays): river opposite the hotel, there is a bar-caffetteria where the woman is an Italian from Rome, and she's very kind and makes a good coffee for exigent Italian tourists always searching for an espresso. The Upper Room Hotel is in a strategic position, 4 minutes walking from the (U-BAHN) that is the metro and 10 minutes froM the S-BAHN station, which is the train station. The staff is kind, and one of the guy (maybe the young manager of the hotel, which is almost always there at the reception) also speaks Italian. Rich continental breakfast. ONLY one thing to remember on the day of your arrival: MIND THE LIFT which is hidden behind the stairs. If you won't see it, you will have to step 3 floors with all your baggages, which is not really a good idea.", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vilnius, Lithuania", "Title": "\u201cHorrible hotel\u201d", "Author": "Guest G", "ReviewID": "UR122446285", "Content": "Horrible hotel with terrible smell in corridors and rooms.

As this hotel was close to Zoo-garten bahnhof, it was most convenient. Be careful looking for the address as I walked by it twice. Also be prepared for walking up the stairs, though tucked away behind the staircase is a nice elevator. The room was modest and clean, the breakfast exceptional. The staff were friendly and accommodating.

Thankfully they arranged everything for us and we got an apartment here instead. It slept 5, but I think it would have been a bit cramped when full. The bathroom was modern and spotless and the living area had a small kitchen and flat screen TV with a separate bedroom sleeping 3. A fold out double sofa bed would have been better than a double bed in the living area though, as there wasn't really anywhere to sit. Only 2 things bugged me during my stay. (1) Strange noises from the floor below that sounded like a drum machine were quite annoying and (2) I nearly smoked out the entire apartment when I switched on the grill as I don't think it had been cleaned for months. Gekko's cocktail bar is right next door and it was one of the best bars we visited. The train station is only a 5 minute walk away and you can be in central Berlin in about 10 minutes.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel-Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - clean, nice, good breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "zivtzi", "ReviewID": "UR61725246", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for 5 days (4 nights), and everything was just great!

If you have a suitcase you will have to carry it upstairs. The rooms are small and simple, which is okay if thats what youre looking for. The service is really bad. Friends and I stayed there for 6 days and they would only clean our towels once, and didnt clean the room every day. One day, we asked for new towels, they eventually took them away but never replaced them. I had to complain to get my towels back (which was also very difficult considering the staff hardly speaks english and they refuse to wash towels more than once) 2 hours later I had to come downstairs to ask for them again. The internet costs 2 euro's an hour, scandalous. Breakfast is all gone by 9.30, we had to search the place for plates, silverwear, cups, etc. When we finally found some, there was no food left. One night the firealarm went off, and I realized the place is a deathtrap. I doubt you can get out of the hotel at all when there is a fire. At last, we did NOT sleep at all because there is so much noise. We can hear people walking and slamming doors, but besides that street noise kept us awake. Loud music, screaming, etc. in the middle of the night. On top of that there was a strange smell in our room. No Im not a fan. Not worth your money unless your a poor student who just wants to go party all night long.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Upper Room Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1726547-Reviews-Upper_Room_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$62 - $143*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Rankestrasse 3</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10789</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1726547", "ImgURL": ""}}
