Our room was small together with a small bathroom but provided all that was necessary for us. unusual in that neither the room or the hallways had any carpet on lino. The breakfast included in the tarrif was adequate but not extensive unless you are used to German sausage and hard boiled eggs. We can't complain about the reception or desk service but conversation was minimal.

The location was perfect. The room was spacious but sparce. The bathroom was super tiny. All was very clean. The real problem was the internet. They said they had a connection in the room and actually had the nerve to charge 5 euro daily when there was really no connection at all unless you went out onto the street and into the next building where the reception was. I had signed on for four days of internet service. After the first day I complained and told him I didn't want to pay for the lousy service and to cancel it. He said that was fine and told me where I might find an internet cafe close by. When I checked out however, it was back on my bill for all nights. He said because he had seen me trying to connect in the coffee room once, I was using the service. It was a fight I lost but will take it up with my credit card company. Staff in general were either cold or just not around so not helpful in any way. The best thing about the hotel was the WWII bunker across the street, now a gallery.. now that's a great place to viist...", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOverall nice experience: good quality & decent price\u201d", "Author": "MLK93", "ReviewID": "UR102419033", "Content": "We decided to book this hotel despite the mixed reviews for a short trip to Berlin. This wasn't my first time in the city and I actually walked past this hotel several times on my last visit to Berlin, so I already knew that it was well-located. What I didn't know was that the hotel rooms actually occupy only the ground floor of the building with the reception and the breakfast room located just underneath. Our room smelled freshly cleaned and we had a nice view of the street through a big window. Breakfast was plenty and far better than most of the other hotels I stayed with in Berlin. Wi-Fi did work in our room, but speeds were faster if you stayed next to the reception while surfing. We also liked the free 5 o'clock tea and cookies (actually from 5 pm to 8 pm). So, if you don't expect any thrills, but a central hotel in a typical Berlin-atmosphere with all the amenities you need for an affordable price, this would be the place to go to.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced-feeling ripped off\u201d", "Author": "Baron095", "ReviewID": "UR86752863", "Content": "The saving grace for this hotel is its handy location. Apart from that it was overpriced for what you get. . Having stayed there 4 years ago it was great and hence did not check the reviews for this recent booking. It has obviously changed management. Reception staff could not speak any english or had absolutely no comprehension. Internet did not work in the rooms despite them advertising it did. To use the internet one had to find one's way through the maze of corridors and doors before getting to the reception area where it worked. Rooms are large but very cold. Wooden chipboard floors were cold to the feet. Our first two nights we could not sleep due to our room being on the corner of two main streets and only after complaining were we moved to what was obviously a more superior room despite us already paying top dollar.Breakfast was limited and on occasion we did not bother going down.Could not get out of our 5 day booking due to cancellation charges so we grinned and bore it!", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cFour star locatiom, three star price, two star value\u201d", "Author": "mklein818", "ReviewID": "UR81650348", "Content": "This joint is clearly an old school two star, with small beds, a weak breakfast, and very limited amenities for at or above Eur 100 a night.
