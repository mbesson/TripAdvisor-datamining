We always stay at a Marriott near Michigan Ave. This is by far our new favorite. We have stayed there twice. The rooms are great, with kitchenettes so we can bring in food if we want. They serve breakfast every morning, included in the room price. The woman running the breakfast is so sweet. She greets everyone and treats them like family. I saw her helping a child fix his waffle. She gave us a huge welcome back even though she only saw us once months before. The location is great for us, about 5 short blocks from the red line. Last visit there was a snow storm on our last night there so we checked out the evening social time. We were able to have a simple meal without having to brave the storm.

Our room was in great condition, and came with a full kitchen including a dishwasher. It was St Patricks Day weekend, and I expected the hotel to be noisy, but it was exceptionally quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The Marriott chain should be proud to have an employee like Ismeta, who ran the breakfast area.

I originally booked my king room for $99 plus tax (AAA rate), that was for a Saturday night in early March. Overall, I would highly recommend Residence Inn or Springhill Suites next door. This is my go-to hotel stay in the city of Chicago. ROOMS: Very, very nice. The door opens to a long corridor that has a kitchenette with a full sized microwave and fridge, along with two small stove burners. There is a desk/dining table that sits two chairs. This leads into a sitting area with a couch, chair and coffee table/foot-rest directly across from the king bed. Flat screen TV was along one wall. There were plenty of electrical outlets to plug into. Since this was a corner suite, two entire walls had floor to ceiling windows. The rooms are large and clean, and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have asked for anything nicer. One note is that the clubs on Hubbard do keep a late-night loud crowd on the street. If you think that might bother you, request an upper floor room. BATHROOMS: Separated by a door into one section for the vanity use, and one for the toilet/shower use. It is a large area to move around. The showers are walk-in and very nice. There is no tub. HOTEL FEATURES: I did not see a restaurant on site, but they do offer a free continental breakfast in the morning. It can get fairly crowded down there, so I did not partake. Note that there is a bagel shop connected to the hotel. I also understand that there is a pool on an upper floor. LOCATION: This is a prime location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the corner of Hubbard and Dearborn. Hubbard is a great spot for River North restaurants and nightlife. There are so many restaurants and clubs within a SHORT walk I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even begin to list them, but rest assured you will not be disappointed. Michigan Ave shopping is a brisk walk or short cab ride away. This is a safe and lively area and one of the best places to stay in the city. WHO I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL FOR: Just about every type of traveler. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a solo pleasure traveler, and the Springhill/Residence Inn is my go-to stay in the city. I see a lot of families and business travelers as well. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone can go wrong here. HOTEL TIP: AAA members get a good discount at this hotel and Springhill Suites. Also note that this hotel offers free wifi. If you have a portable DVD player, the TV has composite connection on the back. Marriott rewards member are more likely to get upgrades.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value and location\u201d", "Author": "Indianapolisresident", "ReviewID": "UR125778335", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Residence Inn Chicago Downtown/ River North in early March 2012. Our room was the 1 bedroom king bed suite (room number 2005). The room was very clean, nicely decorated, and very quiet. The room had everything we needed for a three night stay. The kitchen had a full size frig with icemaker, microwave, utensils, plates, wine glasses, coffee cups, etc. along with a full size coffee pot. (I didn't see a wine opener, but we brought our own).The prepacked coffee that comes with the room is good, but don't forget to bring your favorite sweetener and creamer if you're picky about that since the generic stuff just doesn't start the day right. The bedroom had plenty of drawer space and nice hangers and the king bed was really comfortable. The sink and vanity being separated from the shower/toilet by a door helps speed up morning and bedtime routines. The shower/ toilet area was very roomy, and the vanity had excellent lighting for applying makeup. The only thing I missed was a ledge or something in the shower to help me shave my legs since it is only a shower, and not a tub/shower combo. Harry Caray's steakhouse is just across the street, three blocks north on Clark is the Rainforest Cafe and Hard Rock. There is a CVS drugstore one block west on Kinzie street that sells beer, wine, and liquor besided the usual stuff you forget when on vacation. The pool and hot tub were really clean, and the hot tub was really hot, not just lukewarm. (Great for sore feet after a long day shopping or museum hopping). The exercise room was tremendous! Treadmills with TV's, ellipticals, free weights, and a combination type fitness machine for rowing and pulldown type exercises. The included breakfast had scrambled eggs, ham or sausage patties depending on the day, breakfast potatoes, fruit, yogurt, make your own waffle, muffins, plenty of juices, milk, and coffee. The dining area was quite large and lots of windows to enjoy the city view. The breakfast hostess was friendly and efficient. The entire hotel staff was friendly too. The check-in process was smooth, but we were a little confused about what to do with our car. If you don't want to valet park, go ahead and park in the Greenway parking garage that's attached to the hotel. The garage entrance is on Kinzie street west of the Dearborn intersection. After parking, take your parking ticket with you to the hotel desk. They will convert it into the plastic swipe card that you pay $40 per day for unlimited in/out use during your stay. We didn't know about the parking garage procedure so we pulled up in front of the hotel and had to give our keys to the attendent while we checked in even though we were not going to valet park. This was some kind of hotel policy and bothered us a little. There's also no luggage carts available if you park in the garage so you might have to make more than one trip to the car. Overall though, once everything was in the room, the parking garage was very convenient instead of relying on valet parking. I was very happy with our stay, and think the location and amenities are excellent value for the money. We used AAA discount, online booking through the official hotel site and for the king suite, and the $40 per day parking along with assorted taxes paid $197 per night. Since breakfast and evening \"social hour\" were included, I think we got a fair value without having to resort to the discount bidding type of reservation. I would definitely stay here again when visiting downtown Chicago.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay!\u201d", "Author": "getmethereMichigan", "ReviewID": "UR125457480", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Residence Inn Chicago River North for 2 nights in Feb. while I had a business meeting.

There is a full size coffee maker - if you're staying an extended time and love your coffee bring your favorite brand with filters. No tub but the shower is huge and spotless. Harry Caray's steakhouse is across the street and the House of Blues is just down the block.

There is a \"green\" parking garage attached and we received a discounted rate for being guests of the hotel; every little bit helps in Chicago! We stayed in a \"studio suite\" which is basically a standard room with a kitchenette. There are only three of us and this was plenty of room.

The room also had a little desk area with chairs and offered free wifi. The bathroom area is shower only (with a glass door that looked pretty nice) and had a toilet. The bathroom sink area is right next to the bathroom area and can be separated by the bathroom door so a person could take care of business without disturbing someone else who would like brush their teeth or hair. The sink had three drawers, very well lit, large mirror, and electrical outlet. The only downside to this room is that it is very small. I would recommend this room for two people only. If you do come with three or more be prepared to have no privacy because the fold out sofa bed is right by the foot of the king size bed. When the sofa bed is open there is about 3-4 inches from the bed to the sofa bed. The hotel does offer parking. A person could either park themselves for $38 or have valet do it for $48. We chose valet just for the convenience. It was nice to come out of the hotel and have our car waiting for us. Breakfast everyday was a treat. The hostess was so pleasant.

Since the rooms only have one bed and a sofa bed, we booked two rooms. Both rooms were booked on the same reservation, in hopes that we would be given adjacent rooms. The first person to arrive checked in and we were given rooms next door to each other, 904 and 906. Due to delayed flights, two of us arrived at nearly 2am, and picked up the keys for 904. My first thought upon walking in to room 904 was that it didn't look much like the pictures I'd seen on the website. But I was exhausted and just wanted a few hours of sleep before breakfast. The next morning I saw room 906, that my other friends were in. It was substantially larger, had more furniture, and looked exactly like the photos on the website. We were happy to have rooms next to each other, were only there for three nights, and spent most of our time out exploring, so we didn't complain about the rooms. Had I only booked one room and been given room 904, I wouldn't have realized the difference. But in booking two identical rooms on the same reservation, I expected to be given two identical rooms. It worked out okay for us. Since we only needed to use the sofa bed in one room, we had three people stay in the larger room (906). I don't think there would have been enough room to move around in the room if the sofa bed in 904 had been open. Overall, our experience was pleasant. Breakfast (especially the staff working breakfast) was fantastic. And the location was perfect for us. I would stay here again, if I could be guaranteed to get a room equal to 906.

Most of them aren't unfriendly per se, they just don't offer any real assistance unless you ask. Once you do ask, some are helpful, some aren't. This goes for the front desk staff as well as the doormen. 2. The check-in procedure set's the wrong tone. The hotel seems to allow for no early check-in so by 3:00 pm there were a lot of people waiting to check in . This creates stress and anxiety for the guest and the front desk staff. They simply need to do better. 3. You have to go to the front desk to check out. I waited in line for 20 minutes just to be told that there was no charge and I could leave. It's 2011; surely there is a way for this property to upgrade to an electronic check out. In summary, there are good things about this hotel but there are also things that are frustrating. I can tell you that the new GM told me via email that he is genuinely interested in improving the level of service so it will be interesting to see if he is ultimately successful.

One negative was that the elevators, as a result, seemed quite slow, and when we got one, it was inevitably crowded. The breakfasts were also quite crowded, it was hard to find a seat. Breakfast was just ok; i could have done with more variety of fresh fruit, and the bagels were kind of sweet and stale for a jersey girl.

The rooms are nice, we had a 1 bedroom King with a kitchen - not sure you could really fit more than 2 people here. maybe some really young kids but we don't have kids so just my guess. The bellstaff was nice but not very informed about restaurants, so go knowing about where you should eat otherwise they were very nice and helpful. We arrived on the 29th of June - early then went to Navy Pier- took the free trolley bus but if you have a CTA 3 or 7 day pass there are 2 other buses that travel that route so you can take any of those. Illinois and Grand is closest to the hotel. There is an Osco-Jewel close by there as well if you need groceries. back to the hotel met my sister and her kids for a Cubs game!!!! First time to Wrigley Field! we went early took the Red line to Addison got on at Grand and Lake. They don't open the gates until just an hour before game time I think so we went a bit too early with young kids - however my nephew got picked to go watch batting practice on the field so going early was worth it for us. Not sure how just random and very lucky! great game and getting home was easy - just crowded. the next day we ate breakfast and it was crowded but a great start. we went to Navy Pier with the kids and took a speedboat ride and ate then went to the beach then home for showers and dinner at Harry Caray's across the street which was terrible. drinks were bad and food was not great. overpriced and our waiter was rude. the next day we did Art Institute and Taste of Chicago. bought City Passes which were worth it of you are staying for a few days and can get it all in. went to dinner at Hub 51 but it was just ok - we couldn't get into Frontera Grill which is around the corner and Rick Bayless' restaurant. Just my poor planning - but it was 4th of July weekend and reservations went 2 months prior... Museum of Science and Industry the next day with House of Blues for dinner - it was good and the music was great. Architectural Boat Tour and Shedd were the next day along with dinner at Girl and the Goat - it was awesome! apparently difficult to get a table here as well so we went at 4:15 and they were just opening so we got lucky and got a table t the communal table which was fun! fantastic food! not a place for kids - unless they like squash blossoms and chickpea fritters...no mac and cheese menu/chicken fingers on this menu :) we then went to the skydeck at the old Sears tower now the willis tower. crazy busy. the next day we did the Field museum and then went back to the hotel and picked up our stuff and got on the L for Midway to fly home. You need to leave some travel time for these things - we mostly took the bus after buying the 7 day pass which was very easy to travel on and mostly on time. The drivers on the routes were friendly and helpful in our experience. The City Pass was very helpful as well as it allows to bypass a lot of wait in lines especially at the Shedd so don't buy it there first - go somewhere else buy it then go to the Shedd - that line was always crazy long... We did not do much Mag mile shopping or hang out on Michigan Avenue/shopping places - we were blessed with fantastic weather the whole trip which also made it a bit better I think. hopefully this was helpful- I think we were tired from a lot of walking but what we did was jammed. Not sure if young kids could have done as much in as short a time period - we did see plenty of kids whining at parents to go home...you know your kids best... the flight out of Midway was delayed so we did not take of until 9 pm which was actually really cool because we got to see plenty of fireworks. great trip this hotel was close to transportation and comfortable. could you get closer to transportation - sure but it was fine for us and the free breakfast was a huge bonus. If you stay during the week there are dinners mid week which also might help save money if you are on a budget. happy travels and Go Cubs!!!", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great views and very very clean\u201d", "Author": "Zmaragdi", "ReviewID": "UR115007745", "Content": "Great location, walking distance to main shopping district, hop on hop off bus route.

I was going to email him but thought i would just call him. \\i must admit that he was very understanding and apologized numerous times for our misfortune. I shared with him our problem.. We were 4 ladies coming from Toronto for a 4 day getaway and when we arrived we were told by Michael that apparently our reservation had been cancelled previously...well i can tell you that we didn;t fly to Chicago without a reservation so i am still unsure what happened to our reservation. He worked hard to find us a room unfortunately it took him much longer than it should have and we didn't receive the 1 bedroom suite that we had bboked for but rather a small studio room. The room was very tight and when the sofa was pulled out it actually touched the bed...very close and tight!! We made the very best of our stay and very much enjoyed our trip to Chicago. We must compliment the Manager as i am throughly impressed with Ismeta in the restaurant. | would love to take her back to Toronto and maybe she could teach some of my staff a thing or two. She greeted each guest and had the ability to make waffles, clear tables and communicate with guests. Hats off to Ismelta!!! It is effident that customer service training is provided to the staff as they are very courteous and extremely helpful. The location is wonderful with so many great sites within walking distance. We loved the architecture river cruise and would highly recommend this to everyone. It was worth every penny. Hillary was extremely knowledgeable. I'm so glad that we did this the first night as it gave us a better appreciation of the architecture in the city. we flew into the Midway airport from Porter our Toronto City Airport and would do it again. The staff were very friendly and quick and i would easily travel to this airport again vs going to the big international O'Hare. We hopped on the loop which was a huge cost savings ($2.50 each) The ride was ~ 25 minutes. We splurged on the way to the airport and booked a big surburban for the 4 of us and it was $45 to the airport. Very nice man and again very helpful. Local sites; We went to a local resturant for Chicago pizza and i would highly recommend this place vs some of the well known places like uno or duo pizza (very overrated and not good quality or price) The restaurant recommended by the conceirge was Lou Mahatis. The best pizza we've ever had. We were so surprised that we were able to feed the 4 of us two had a beer for only $50.. we had the special and the vegetarian, salad and an appetiser plate. Amazing pizza. Wish i could find something like that back in Ontario ...pizza pizza seems oh so cardboard like now! Another must for restaurants is the Rocking Rocket down the street from the hotel. Oh my the burger was so good...whoever thought of putting brie cheese on a burger. i can't describe how good the food was the truffle sweet potato fries were the best ever....the place was packed and everyone in our party were over the top thrilled Another great place in the howl to the moon ...not sure what to expect but alot of fun Another great spot to eat is the mitynice in the water tower place. We thought we would just split a salad and a tuna burger wow...supersize me the food quantity was so large and the food was so amazing we had no room left to go Sullivans that nite |(we really were craving a good steak but no room!!). again great food and great service. We also booked a sailboat tour and enjoyed that as well to see the skyline. Millenium park is a must and you must be sure to check out the \"Bean\" We walked every where as there is so much to see. it is something to see the Loop above ground as our train system in Toronto is a subway with the majority below ground We recommend checking out Groupon great way to save some coin when you're in the city. We all agreed that the ctity was incredibly clean with lots of green space and the locals were sooooo nice... and we thought we Canadians were friendly... Even though it is a big city it has a small town feel. i know this is to be just about the RI but i always love to hear from other people where to go when in a new city. I want to thank the staff at the RI especially David for his very timely response to my concerns regarding our check in.

The Hotel staff is unbelievable. Two people assisted me when I checked in Jennifer and Michael the night auditor. Jennifer, who I found out is new, has a smile that will warm your very spirit. She is as nice and friendly as can be. We arrived early so she offered to store our bags and took my cell phone number so she could call us when a room on a higher floor was ready. It did not take long, we walked to Harry Caray\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s across the street and by the time our beer arrived Jennifer called to tell me that she had a room for us. When we returned we watched as a group of people were giving Michael undeserved grief about not being able to get a large number of rooms, together, on the same floor with an early check in. I could not believe what I witnessed. Michael had every reason to tell the group to take a hike but he was as professional and courtesy as could be and wound up accommodating this unworthy group of malcontents. He then gave us our room and I think we got a little something extra for commenting on how nice he was. It was also a relief to find that he was knowledgeable about the city and attractions and bus routes and greeted me every time we passed through the lobby. The hotel rooms are spacious and well equipped. We had a studio suite and it was spacious. There are pots and pans, dishes a large refrigerator, dishwasher and two-burner stove. They provide a nice iron, not one of those cheap ones and provide soap and shampoo. The complimentary internet is fast enough, the beds are nice, the recliner was great, and there is a table to work on and a table to eat on. When we walked in my girlfriend and out said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this is a nice room! I would clearly take advantage of the complimentary breakfast. They serve waffles, eggs, sausage, juices, coffee and really is would be a waste to have breakfast anywhere else. The days I was there Latoya and Ismeta were working. Both are unbelievable. They are pleasant, friendly and helpful. I told Latoya how I really appreciated her hard work and she responded by saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are happy that you are here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ismeta is legendary as evidenced by all the positive feedback that she receives. She is originally from Bosnia and she loves having a job around happy people in the U.S. It was refreshing! On my second day I arrived after breakfast was closed and Ismeta insisted on getting us fruit and juice. I have to tell you, Ismeta and Latoya are real gems. Finally, the hotel is in a great location. The subway is really close, the bus is right across the street as is Harry Carey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and the House of Blues. I would definitely take the 22 bus and have sushi at RA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Rush Street (happy hour is from three to six) which is a ten minute bus ride away. I would consider taking the bus to Wrigley Field so you can see the Lincoln Park area and Wrigleyville.

The maid would ask us when we wanted our room made up if she saw us in the mornings. The maid service was very responsive to my request for a new hair dryer when I had a problem with the one in the room. The breakfast buffet was average but since it's included in the price of the room, we can't complain. There was plenty to eat at breakfast and the hotel lady who worked the breakfast buffet each morning was super friendly and attentive. She couldn't have been nicer. They also offer complimentary beer/wine and lite fare in the evenings (at least during the week, not sure about weekends). The front desk staff was flexible about letting us check out late on our last day. We suggest that you ask for a room on the higher floors as your view will be much better the higher you go. We were on floor 15 even though we had been offered the 24th floor. We didn't realize the view on the 15th floor would be partially blocked by a parking garage outside our window. Another tip is that if you take public transporation from the airport, take the CTA Blue Line to the Clark&Lake stop and it's a relatively easy walk to the hotel from there (about 3 blocks). Don't take a route that transfers from the blue line to the red line just to get a block closer because the walk to do the transfer from the blue to red line is very unpleasant - up and down stairs and through a smelly dirty tunnel.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pinckney MI", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT all the way around!!\u201d", "Author": "Roadie56", "ReviewID": "UR79438903", "Content": "We spent our 25th anniversary the past weekend in this fabulous hotel.

I read many of the previous reviews and feel like they give a very accurate depiction of the Residence Inn River North. First, the location is great. You are about 3 blocks north of the Chicago River on Dearborn and about 4 blocks west of Michigan Avenue. You are only about 2 blocks from the redline station on State and Grand. Tons of restaurants within walking distance. We had no problem getting anywhere we wanted. Safety/security was no concern. I felt totally comfortable walking around at all hours of the day and night. Will mention what others have said about being near a fire station--one block to the north. Yes, you can hear the sirens. Since we read the reviews, I requested a high floor and stayed on the 21st. Had no issues with noise from street bothering us. But the lower the floor, the higher the risk of you being bothered by street noise. Room was very spacious and comfortable. Had a decent kitchen setup--full fridge, microwave, dishwasher, sink and 2 burner oven. Nice look to the kitchen too with cabinetry and stainless appliances. room had a couch and full-sized chair in sitting area. Full wall was total glass with a nice city view. Commercial property directly across the road. Did have smaller building across as well that allowed for a full view to the NE. We could see all the way over to Marriott on Michigan Avenue along with several other highrise residential units. I thought the view was decent (we faced towards dearborn and looked North ). Bedding was good. Not the top of the line Marriott mattress though. But I had no problems. Shower was above average. total glass door and plenty of room. Only downside of bathroom area was only single vanity. The vanity was located next to bed in nook before entering bathroom/shower. Double vanity would have made for much more room for two trying to get ready. TV was situated next to window in middle of room. some may not like this setup. Normally the TV is placed in front of the bed. Can't do that in this room setup. But wasn't a big deal to me. i wasn't there to watch TV. TV channels were Direct TV Satellite. Ok selection with HBO too. Lobby entrance is on second level. Saw where some people complained about this. Dont really understand this. Yes, you have to go to two different sets of elevators to get to your room. I assume they do this for security reasons and logistics of property. Its not a big deal. I thought service was excellent. All of the workers that we encountered were pleasant and helpful. Service was not a problem. Complimentary breakfast was a madhouse. It was extremely busy and crowded. But...you are getting a free breakfast at a downtown hotel. Food selection was good--waffles, sausage, eggs, potatoes, bagels and donuts. If you don't want to mess with the crowd, go down the street and pay for breakfast--pretty simple. You do get free wireless internet at this property, too. In case you haven't read other posts, this property does share the building with a Springhill Suites. When you come up the street level elevator, the Springhill lobby is to the left and the Residence Inn is to the right. Residence Inn does have three computers downstairs that you can use as well. Just a couple of more points--does have workout room and pool on top floor. No room service or restaurant. Valet parking or self park. I think $48 and $38 per day. All in all, I was very happy with this property. It was exactly what I was expecting--maybe even a little bit better. Is this a 5-star hotel? No. Don't forget, this is a Residence Inn--a few notches down the Marriott food chain. But it is a very nice and clean property in a fantastic location. For the price, I think it is very difficult to beat in downtown Chicago. Read the reviews and make your own choice. Are you looking for luxury like a Michigan Avenue hotel? You will probably be disappointed. But I wasn't thinking this was going to be the Ritz Carleton or a Four Seasons.

Just days before we flew to the USA the woman at the property management company e-mailed by niece who had made the booking to say that the property \"had been damaged\" and we couldn't have it. My niece asked if she had any other properties of a similar size and was told \"no.\" She asked if we could rent several smaller places to take us all, \"no.\" Could she recommend any other property rental places - \"no.\" Sooooooooooo helpful - NOT!. They even had the audacity to say it would take 7 to 10 days to refund the the thousands of dollars we had paid up front. it was paid back in two instalments and only after several e-mail enquiries. Would I use Elite Chicago Rentals again? Never in a million years!!!! Anyway, it was our lucky day as our niece managed to get 4 studio apartments in the Residence Inn in North Dearborn Street. The rooms are OK and are very well equipped and reasonably priced but what makes the place is the incredibly friendly and helpful staff. It was a pleasure to stay there. Close enough to walk into the city centre, a great steakhouse called Harry Carray's on the opposite corner and a great bar with live music called \"Howl at the Moon\" a few minutes walk in the opposite direction. Go there when they have the pianists and the rest of the band on - they're great. While you're there try a bucket of cocktails - yes, that's right, a bucket!

Every positive comment made on this site about this hotel is appropriate. One evening, my wife made a very positive comment to the front desk about Ismeta the breakfast hostess/waitress and the staff told her to look at TripAdvisor where she is a mini-star. Her status on this site is certainly well deserved. Many times Ismeta helped my wife with getting breakfast together for her and our 16 month old son. On days help wasn't necessary-- she always had several good words and smiles and the offer to help was always right there. Whatever they pay her is not enough (sorry Marriott). And although Ismeta is the staff \"star\" the rest of the staff is not far behind. They were not only courteous but friendly, almost like family-- and not in an overly-gracious sort of way. They were really pitch perfect. Another special thank you to Billy at the front desk-- who consistently helped with our stay. Complementary breakfast is provided seven days a week. Four nights a week they have \"happy hour\" complementary dinner with wine and beer (also complementary) served. Granted, there are several great restaurants literally within a three block radius, but, for a free bite and beer, you can' t beat it.

I was not happy with this one. At checkin, they put a $100 \"hold\" on my bank account for \"incidentals.\" I have no idea what that is, and they couldn't explain it when I asked about it. After I checked out with a zero balance due, the $100 \"hold\" remained on my bank account for several days thereafter. I called the hotel about this, and even though they agreed that I had a zero balance and didn't owe them anything, they could not remove the $100 \"hold\" from my bank account. They said that it should \"fall off\" of my account's pending transactions after a few days, and indeed that happened a few days after I called, but I should not have been charged for this in the first place. And what \"incidentals\" are they talking about, anyway? This place has no room service and has no stocked refrigerator. So there is no good reason that I can discern for the $100 \"hold.\" By the way, I was not informed that this $100 \"hold\" would be imposed when I booked the hotel. Now to the room. The \"blackout\" curtains in our 16th floor room were insufficient to block out the lights from the adjoining properties. There was no operating vent or window in the bathroom (vent exists but since it was not connected to any switch it could not be turned on). There was only one bedside nightstand rather than one on each side of the bed. The bed just barely fit into the space: there was less than two feet of walkable clearance between the wall and the foot of the bed. Another weird thing: this property is a Residence Inn/Springhill Suites, but it wasn't like most Residence Inns. I have stayed in Residence Inns many times but this is not what I have come to expect. There was no silverware or dishwasher, no dishware, no kitchen, no kitchen sink, no full size refrigerator (only a college dorm type small refrigerator) and there is no freezer at all. No ice or vending machines available on any floor (you have to go down to the \"convenience\" store near the front desk, and they ran out of ice even there). The breakfast was not very good and the breakfast facility was far too small for the number of hotel guests who were trying to use it. Perhaps my problems were attributable to the fact that I was shuffled over to the \"Springhill Suites\" part of this property, but when they lead you to believe that you're booking and staying in a Residence Inn, I don't think that you should be given the bait and switch to a Springhill Suites. I never heard of Springhill Suites before, but it's no Residence Inn, that's for sure. The parking was very expensive. I left my car at home, and that would have been fine but for the fact that the nearby Grand and State subway station (CTA Red Line) is under construction currently and the escalator was out of service due to the construction. That was a problem with all of the luggage, etc. I will say one good thing about this property: it was very quiet and it's in a good location. Finally, this place is not well suited for couples looking for a getaway.

The location could not be better. Close to the CTA system. We rode cabs as for 4 people most rides were only $10.00. CTA buying single passes it would have been $7.00, so no brainer. The room was spacious. I was worried about some comments I heard about not having space with the pull out sofa out, but there is still a good 3 feet of space between the bed and the pull out bed. It was not an issue for us. It was great having the microwave (there is free mwave popcorn provided, next to the coffee packets), the full fridge is sooo convenient (we brought a cooler full of snacks). Full dishwasher, sink, silverware and dinnerware for four, and a 2 burner stove (no oven). We had lots of room to stretch out, the furniture was confy, we never felt crowded.

This was a GREAT hotel! We booked it for $119/night which seemed like a steal! It was centrally located and we walked all over the city. From the moment we pulled up, the service was impeccable from the valet station to the bellhops to the check-in desk. Everyone was friendly and helpful. There is a small lobby at street level and you take an elevator to the first level to check in. From there, you access a different bank of elevators to go to your room and you need your keycard to use the elevator. I liked this added level of security as my daughter and one of the friends we were with are only 17 years old. We stayed in a studio suite which, I believe, is the smallest room they offer. There was a wall of floor to ceiling windows which made the room seem very light and much bigger than it probably was. It also had a flat screen TV. There was a small but very nice kitchenette which included a microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator and two burner cooktop. There was a king size bed as well as a pullout couch. I spent a night on each bed and both were comfortable. Even with four of us in the room, we felt that it was spacious. The bathroom sink was outside of the toilet and shower area which was very convenient while traveling with two teenage girls! There was no bathtub but a large walk-in shower which we really liked. Free WiFi is also provided which we always like to have. The lounge and breakfast area are on the same level as the front desk. There were four computer/printer stations available for guest use at no charge which came in handy for printing some tickets we had purchased online. There is also a large flat screen TV and comfortable couches and chairs. This came in handy when my friend and I were ready to sleep but our daughters wanted to stay up talking. They just went down to the lounge and we felt that they would be very safe there. The buffet breakfast included a lot of hot items and was delicious. The dining area had plenty of tables with wonderful views of the streets below. Also, if you stay on any Monday through Thursday night, there is a free, light dinner meal provided in the lounge. We didn't take advantage of it but thought that was pretty generous! There is a pool and fitness area on the top floor. I didn't see it but my daughter checked it out and said it was very nice. I asked a lot of questions at the front desk about things we were planning to do. Not only did they answer my questions patiently but also made additional suggestions. I also utilized the valet parking. It was $44 for each 24 hours which, for Chicago, is pretty typical. I checked the car in and out several times and the service was quick and efficient.

I couldnt understand why we were paying the same rate for such different sized rooms. I went to the desk to ask for a larger room and was told there were none available near my first room and no other 2 large rooms together available in the hotel, hard to believe since there is 27 floors. After much complaining from me, they said they would try to upgrade me to a 1 bedroom suite but then said they could not since I booked through a 3rd party. Then they did offer me another room but it was at the opposite end of the hotel which was unacceptable to me. I continued to complain and also mentioned that I would be writing the corporate office to let them know how dissatisfied I was and they finally did upgrade me to a 1 bedroom suite right across the hall from our other room. Both of the rooms we had were very nice and clean. Only disappointment was that I found dirty socks underneath the couch cushion when putting the sofa bed out which lead me to believe they did not change mattress pads between guests. The rest of the hotel was also very clean and new looking. There was a very large lobby with comfortable seating, TV, computers, etc. The free breakfast was exceptional with large selection including make your own waffles. The lady that was working in the dining area each morning was very friendly and helpful, she even offered to make waffles for guest, got refills on drinks and made sure everyone was well taken care of. The free dinners (Monday to Thursday) were a pleasant surprise. We had soup and sandwiches the first night, Lasagna, salad, garlic bread the second night, and hot dogs and brats the last night. There was also free soft drinks, wine, beer, and snacks. Have never been to a hotel that served such wonderful free meals. Saved us alot of money.

Upon departing the hotel for the train station, we asked one of the men at the door if there was a van that would accomodate all 5 of us. He told us to wait and then proceeded to run up the street.

There were ample amount of restaurants, bars, shops, etc from the hotel as well. This hotel is in the heart of the city and very close to the river. The famous Harry Carey's restaurant/bar is directly across the street, which we went to twice! There is an Einstein Brother's Bagel's next door as well, which was convenient for snacks/coffee. All the rooms were suite style with a modern kitchen, sofa and chair, flat screen TV, bed and bath. The kitchen was not fully equipped, but had everything that was needed for a week: glasses, plates, bowls, wine glasses, pitchers, can opener, tupperware, etc. The continental breakfast was open early and was great!! They had multiple varieties of warm drinks (which were good while being in Chicago in Nov!) such as coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc. There was a waffle machine (popular for the kids!), muffins, bagels, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc. This was one of the top free continental breakfasts we've had. The staff was friendly and helpful. They helped us with directions, getting taxi's, restaurant/bar suggestions, etc. One of the best things they did for us is be honest on what was a walk-able distance for us from the hotel versus needing a taxi. For the value, this was a great hotel. We plan on coming back to Chicago and staying here a second time. I would recommend this to anyone with kids and dogs (they have a pet program)!!", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kande1", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for Thanksgiving week.\u201d", "Author": "kande1", "ReviewID": "UR22294535", "Content": "This is a great hotel only one block from the river. It is easy to walk everywhere downtown from here. As a family with dietary restrictions, it was very nice to have the kitchen and be able to avoid eating out. The breakfast here is huge, and it is included. The breakfast room is nicer than most restaurants. We didn't really need another meal after the breakfast here, maybe just a snack or a light dinner in the room in the evening. There is a manager's reception Sun-Thurs, so it is possible that you could just have an apple or something in the afternoon, and be able to avoid eating out completely! The rooms are beautiful here. Our room was on the 26th floor, and it had two big bedrooms and two full bathrooms. The pull out couch was very comfortable for our 13 year old son. Another child could have slept on the cushion that comes off of the pull out couch, because it is a solid cushion, about 5 feet long and 2.5 feet wide. The two bedroom sleeps six people. We loved being on the 26th floor, it was perfect!!! I wouldn't even look into another hotel for the next time! The rooms are available from $119 a night. Our room went for $360 a night. Be aware that this is a pet friendly hotel, but it is smoke-free. We only saw one dog there, and there was no dog smell at all. The ventilation system is really good. There was a slight sewer gas smell in our bathroom. It was coming from under the toilet. They sealed it with caulk while we were there. They said they would fix it from under the toilet after we left. This is a great hotel and I can't imagine any problem that couldn't be taken care of just by asking the friendly staff. This is a great place for families to stay while visiting Chicago. There were lots of kids staying there while we were there, but the rooms were perfectly quiet inside.

I agree with the smallest suite review!!! I was directed to three other rooms before I found one where I could finally open the drawer in the bedroom without hitting the bed, but there was no bathtub, only a shower. I was also told I would get a view of the fireworks, however on check-in it appears that no one bedroom suites had that view --- or any river view. I bought a pizza to heat only to return and discover there was no oven even though a full kitchen is advertised. There is only a two burner top, a full size refrig and a dishwasher---I would rather have a mini-fridge or no dishwasher and an oven. A lot of people do not \"nuke\" food. The evening light meal was more than adequate, but staff ran out of pasta and salad and brownies at 7:15, did not make more due to time, but did offer more bread and beverages. This has never happened anywhere I stayed before---especially with the receptionist indicating I could wait until 7:30 to make a plate for my daughter---I went to Trader Joes's and bought some pasta to go with the sauce. Yes, it is complimentary, but very much expected ...there were several other disgruntled families and businessmen. I do not like the split lobby, but obviously the owners are trying to economize in every way they can and have rented out the ground floor. It is probably safer and the second floor dining area is quite pleasant witht he second floor view. Everything is a trade-off. I totally prefer the comfort and amenities of the Residence Inn on Walton (miracle mile), however, it is a bit overrun with the \"American Girl\" groupies on the weekends and too many unruly children. This is more in the working/business section. However, many convention busses do not stop here and the front desk personnel indicated a one block walk south to the Westin River North when I called. After I checked in, it appears a three block walk to the Hilton Garden Inn for Convention shuttle. On the positive side, it is new and very clean. The internet works very well. I have not experienced the slow elevator problem described in previous emails yet. The staff appears used to the small room comments and are trying to fend the issue as graciously as possible. The top floor pool looked very nice, as did the work out facility...much nicer than the Residence on Walton for work out and that place has no pool. I would suspect this is a foreign owned Marriott as it is not similar to standard for this country in terms of space, amenities, etc. I will check on it.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit Area", "Title": "\u201cSmallest Residence Inn Rooms Ever\u201d", "Author": "Ms_Margo", "ReviewID": "UR21757694", "Content": "My husband, teenaged son and I stayed there last weekend.

It took them forever to clean the room on Saturday (they came about 4 p.m. after we had been gone all day). The breakfast was good.
