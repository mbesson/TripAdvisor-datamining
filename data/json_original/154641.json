Room was kind of small but very clean and with a beatufil view of the city from the balcony. There was a young lady at the reception when we checked in and She was very polite and friendly. She helped us to solve an issue with our reservation in the most pleasant way ! I will definetly stay at the hotel the next time that I go to Mexico !. By the way It is also very secure because it is located next to a Police Station that is open 24 hours .You can go out at night and just walk to the Hotel because all the Zona Rosa night life is within walking distance from the Hotel. That is a great PLUS .

This is the second time we choose Century Hotel and all was the same as a year before. One of the elevators is always out of service but beside that, all is wonderful there. This time was floor 17th. The room has a decent space to take a coffee next to a great view to Liverpool street and you can see many buidings from there. The bathroom is good, has a big round tube with shower and many towels to use. No noise from the aisle or other rooms but some pours from the streets, because of its splendid location. We book it on advance and this time we asked for a buffet breakfast, which was a better choice. Coffee, chocolate, croissants, yogurth, juices, ham, cheese, all was good and you can pick whatever you want. The people of the buffet was beyond kind to us. They also have a free Internet connection. There's a lot of shops around including restaurants, bars, antiques and souvenirs. There's a great cd and dvd store two blocks away and another big book store, just ask on the desk. With the Angel of the Independence, the Chapultepec Park (the Anthropology Museum, Zoo, Gardens, etc) a couple of blocks away and every bus and metro available at the same distance, we can't think of a better place to stay in DF. Yes, the \"zocalo\" (historical district) is somehow far, but at night this is a better zone to stay and walk around and you can take the Metro which is just a block away... or even a bus. Not a single trouble on the streets or in the Metro. Just be careful, don't take big purses or jewels and try to plan your trip in advance. You can go to places as far as Xochimilco just by taking the Metro!

The location is good since you are close to every shop and restaurant but also you should take into account that it is mostly a gay district. If you are travelling with kids or teens like us you should be aware of this and consider if you will feel comfortable in a place where 90% of people around you are gay couples expressing freely their love in public. The hotel is not a big deal but to me it looked clean and comfortable. My teen daughter thought that it looked a bit like a sex motel just like one of the travellers mentioned. There were hair driers and lock boxes free of charge in the room. There were bubbles, bottled water and other courtesy items from the hotel, too. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a clock but you were kindly warned to ask at the reception desk to be woken up in the morning. The maid was very helpful, she offered to make our rooms also in the evenings after siesta time and she would come to the room at bed time to let some chocolates on the bed. One day we had trouble with our video camera plugs, my son went to the reception desk for a piece of advise and one of the maintenance men was very kind.
