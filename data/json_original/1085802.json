{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Convenient Location at a decent price I stayed at this hotel a few years back and it's close to shopping and restaurants. Especially Anime  Manga fans will find it convenient for shopping.The rooms are decently large for Tokyo, the bathroom quite small though. Amenities were okay. The room was very clean.There is a free internet station in the lobby that you can use. Staff was nice enought to let me print out my online check-in ticket for the flight back too.Minus point was the pillow (in retrospect I should have simply asked for another) which was quite hard and the sound from the street below. If possible ask for a room not facing the street. I was on the 2nd floor and facing the street so morning traffic woke me up every day.Other than that I'd say it's definitely good value for your money.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR990672329", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Firsa99"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066460-d1085802-r20660833-Hotel_Wing_International_Ikebukuro-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1085802", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
