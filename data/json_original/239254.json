{"Reviews": [{"Content": "They Might Play the Ditry Tricks I booked this hotel because of my sudden itinerary change and the owner of the BB I'd booked recommended me this accommodation.When I arrived at this small charming hotel, I was informed that my room's bathroom was broken, it had happened just right in the night before my arrival, what a coinccidence!May I take a look at the room? I asked, and get a negative response, after the blond staff disscussing with the manageer in l'italiano. According to the blond staff, there was construction going on in the room so it was messy so I couldn't even have a glimpse of it(like the room had been bombed). It seemed to me that the major reason was that the room were occupied by other guests.So, they arranged me a dark room in a nearby hotel for tourist groups - Hotel Le Due Fontane. The most unacceptable part of this episode was that they still charge me 120 euros for that looked-far-more-cheaper room. Although the blond staff told me they were very sorry and willing to find another hotel in the city, in the super high season of September, it was impossible to find another nice accomation for a reasonable price at 18:00 of Friday evening. I was almost forced to take their offer.To make this experience even more ironic and irritable, next day morning I heard a guest talk to the manager with saying:I don't want to leave here.., that meant they'd actually talked to each other in English before! The manager just pretended to be unable to speak English for handling the bathroom problem!This is a nice and clean hotel in a convient location...but do make sure that they really have a room ready for you.", "Date": "Apr 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR211067429", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JeremyHuang"}, {"Content": "Great location - wonderful staff We found the hotel on Orbitz and chose it based on location and price but found the whole experience just wonderful. The hotel is small and the service is quite personal. The rooms are simple and clean and breakfast is served on a room top deck overlooking the historica district. We felt quite at home and would recommend it to anyone. The location is spectacular - just down the street from Il Duomo and one weekend each month artisans from the Tuscany countryside hold a farmer's market and craft show in the square at the opposite end of the street.", "Date": "Nov 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR642594368", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mwells27"}, {"Content": "Past its prime, but still acceptable I have stayed in this hotel many times over the last seven years, most recently in July 2007. It used to be an excellent boutique hotel. My last stay was somewhat disappointing though. The bathroom was smelly, the shower curtain musty and the soap holder thorougly rusted. There is obviously a maintenance problem. I mentioned this to the front desk, who told me that the hotel was recently taken over by a new owner who now plans to start renovating the rooms by the end of this year. Apart from the bathroom problem, the hotel was as nice as ever. Lovely breakfast on the terrace, friendly staff and a great location.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR652800038", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "frank2007"}, {"Content": "Lovely place, don't be fooled by the romantic photos! All in all, this is a lovely hotel. The rooms are large, clean and tastefully decorated. The location is also fantastic - about 5 minutes walk from the Duomo. However, when we were booking the room the Web site had some lovely pictures of the terrace bar. This was one of the key reasons we chose this hotel over the others in Florence - so we could relax with a drink and watch the world go by. The reality was that there was no terrace bar. There was a terrace, which is used for breakfast, but we encountered a rather grumpy waitress who told us off twice for moving from a table inside to a table outside once it had become free.", "Date": "Jul 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR240030823", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "A Wonderful Hotel Simply but luxuriously furnished with quality antiques, perfect location, lovely large room with luxury bathroom, very friendly and helpful staff, terrific breakfast on the roof terrace - what more could anyone want?", "Date": "May 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR765136924", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "goodoldboy"}, {"Content": "Fantastic!

We visited Italy on our honeymoon in 2001. The Relais delle Arti was our favorite hotel by far. It's not sumptuous or particularly fancy, but it was the most comfortable and felt like home. Our room was very large, as was the bathroom compared to most European hotel baths. The breakfast room was lovely, and the food tasty and plenty of it. The staff was very, very helpful in making restaurant reservations and helping us in general. Perfect location, too; we walked everywhere.
