I'm not a fussy traveller but this place just had no soul. The staff were indifferent at best and often rude and unfriendly and we did not feel one bit welcome. We had hoped it would be a nice place to retreat to after a day's sightseeing in Rome but instead we felt isolated and trapped because there was no atmosphere in the hotel and since it literally is in the middle of nowhere we had little alternative but to retire early. The bar is not a bar, just a one man show at a small counter in the hallway with a very limited drinks selection. The bar man was cranky and could not cope if under pressure. Breakfast was ok but forget about dinner. It was atrocious. We went into the restaurant the first night we arrived as it was late and when we saw what was on offer we walked out again. I even tried a massage in the spa and it was the worst massage I ever got.

We stayed in a \"Superior\" room as this was the option for twin beds when originally booked. Room was clean and tidy. Balcony was adequate and had could easily accomodate a table and 2 chairs. Breakfast buffet was included and was varied- fruits, cold meat and cheese, cereal, eggs, bacon and Italian sausage. Pool was larger than most city hotel pools (about 30m x 15m- 95ft x 45ft), and went from 1m to 1.5m at the shallow end, then dipped to approx 2.5m. (3ft-5 ft; 10ft) Staff were unfailingly courteous and helpful. English ability varied, but it appeared that at least some staff could also speak Spanish, German and Russian, and it is unreasonable to expect hotel staff to be fluent in languages, unless they are booking managers. A small problem was the evening meal. There was an option of buffet or a la carte. The buffet was \u20ac28 per person, including bottled water and coffee. However, the a la carte was quite expensive, so there was no real option for someone who just wanted a light meal. Having said that, the buffet included fruit, cheese, salad, grilled vegetables and similar antipasti, two pasta choices and two cooked choices- fish and meat, and if one was vegetarian or had intolerances, it would be perfectly possible to have a nice and substantial meal while avoiding certain items. The shuttle bus left the hotel on the hour from 8:00 to 22:00, and arrived in central Rome (near the Vatican) about 15 mins later, and left the pickup point at 20 mins past the hour. Those wanting an early start or late pickup needed to book a day in advance. We travelled into Rome between 11:00 and 13:00, and returned between 16:20 and 19:20, and there was no problem. The bus is not restricted per se, but as it has approx 20 seats, it works on a first come-first served booking basis. It is perfectly possible for guests to just arrive and try their luck, but no guarantee if pre-booking was not made. Check-in and checkout were easy and professional.

It was definitely not within walking distance to any location but the shuttle to the vatican was so conveinient. It dropped you off right at the vatican walls and the metro was a 5 min walk away. The trade off being right outside the city was the pool for the kids. After long hot crowded days of touring the pool was a nice way to cool off and relax. The rooms were spacious and clean. The beds were very comfortable. The front desk was hit or miss depending on who was working. For the most part is was good, I had some instances where it was lousy but this didn't take away from the overall great experience too much. I will say that I emailed thehotel several times to ask about hotel/airport shuttles and I never received a answer. I ended up booking a private shuttle through Romashuttle which worked out fine. For 4 people and 5 pieces of luggage it was 50 euro. My father in law did not book in advance and paid 80euro at the airport. The included breakfast was quite nice. Eggs, bacon, breads, meats, and cheeses....we went to the night buffet once.

It's apparent that this hotel wants you to enjoy every bit of your meal. Having dinner or breakfast out on the terrace is a must for anyone liking a scenic view. The Hotel has been remodeled but the bathrooms need serious updating. The bathroom floors can get slick and for older people it will be a problem. If you book a room for two people, you will need ask for an additional robe and slippers when you arrive, for each room only gets one set. If you ask for anything from the front desk be aware that they are always busy and really don't have time for little details. The staff is friendly enough, but just not able to follow through on things. When using the phone, dial 3 as all the other numbers just ring and ring. Also note, that if you want extra towels (and you will) it will take hours before you get them. Again, it's the communication from the front desk to the cleaning staff. The cleaning staff is great and very helpful when you can get a hold of them. The pool is wonderful and the spa is great. Check out any of the services for the spa. Any of the massages are well worth the money. Marco is fantastic. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. The pedicures are not as thorough as what you would expect from the States, and they do not put top coats on hands or feet, so be prepared to loose your color by weeks end. Using the spa during your stay is very affordable and relaxing after touring the city. Getting a taxi at the Hotel is tricky. It can take half and hour or more and the taxi starts charging for the ride the moment it receives a call from the hotel. It can get pricy. Yes, the Hotel has a bus service, but it is always full and you need to book a seat well in advance. You also need to book in advance if you would like to return on the bus and you have to stick with that time commitment as you will not be able to make a last minute change. The bus stops at one place only which is by the Vatican so if you are touring the rest of Rome, you will either have to walk back to the bus stop or take a taxi. Getting a taxi in the city is very easy and affordable. When you call for a taxi from the Hotel, the front desk staff will give you a receipt with an order number and taxi name. This is your taxi, meaning it is not first come first serve basis. You can only take the taxi that was called for you. This can be very frustrating as you can have people order taxis later than you and they are picked up before your taxi arrives. All the taxis are private contractors and well, pretty much arrive when they can or want to. The front desk will always tell you that it will take five minutes for the taxi, but this clearly is not the case. The food and spa make this Hotel a five star, but the front desk staff and room accommodations make it a three star. Not everyone will want to use the spa or eat at the Hotel, so that is why it receives an overall three stars.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel and swimming pool - but some clothes disappeared\u201d", "Author": "Kelvin20", "ReviewID": "UR113940144", "Content": "It's a huge hotel, beautiful and luxurious.

The bartender in the lobby bar had a great attitude - gave good advice on a daytrip to the coast with trams and trains.The hotel has its own bus that brings visitors to the center. This works smoothly - for all guests to book tickets. If you wish to travel into the city center at 09 or 10 in the morning you should book the night before, due to shortage of seats when all guest want to travel to the center. Some people complained and argued when they did not get seats (might explain why some write about poor service on this website). The return journey, we experienced often empty seats - so we always got seats even without tickets. Conclusion: The bus worked fine (with a little planning) Very quiet hotel - far from Rome's traffic. It was felt wonderful after visiting the bustling city.

Waited 20mins in reception to check in behind a very large family group. Other staff milling around reception but nobody checked us in. When we were checked in, there was no greeting, and certainly not an apology for our wait. No chance of a smile, just a gruff handing over of the keycard. I enquired about the shuttle service for the following day. I was told I had to book. I said we would like to reserve places on the earliest bus as we were attending Easter Mass. The earliest bus with places was 12pm - totally useless. I explained that the shuttle service was the whole reason for booking the hotel and it had not been clear that the service had to be reserved and was so limited (one bus an hour with 15 seats). The man at the desk simply shrugged his shoulders and said I would have to get a taxi. He could not have cared less. I asked how much this would be and he said 10 Euros. Had it been my hotel, the taxi would have been complimentary in the circumstances, but there we go. There was nothing to stop the shuttle going more frequently - it is a ten minute trip into the city - up to three shuttles an hour both ways, and at one point there were two buses, so no excuses! Feeling we had little choice, we booked the taxi via the hotel. Yes, the taxi was 10 euros. BEFORE LEAVING THE HOTEL!!!! I queried this with the taxi driver upon seeing the meter and he said we had to pay for him to go to the hotel. Crazy. And certainly not made clear. I later suggested to reception they might want to tell their guests about this and, again, they didn't care. And literally shrugged their shoulders. The leisure facilities you think are included with your stay? Not the jacuzzi/spa area. Wanted to go for a half hour dip before it closed and we were told we would have to pay 20 euros each. Needless to say, we didn't, but this is just another way this hotel tries to rip off its 'guests' (and for those who need wi-fi, this draconian place charges for it). I was charged 3 days city tax for a two day stay - the final insult - especially as we had booked and prepaid via the hotel's own site. And the city as a whole is so expensive and full of hidden charges. Breakfast was nice on day one - we went down at 07:30. On day two, when we went down at about 9, it was chaos. Things weren't re-stocked (glasses, plates, food), service was non-existent (day 1, we had ahd tea brought to our table, day 2 it was self-service). We had to share dirty tables with other guests as there was a lack of room and the staff were completely overwhelmed. I have seen the hotel's response to a recent review from some students. That the manager who has responed seems to think it is okay to somehow blame the guests and exonerate the staff (even where there is an appparent scam!) exemplifies this hotel's attitude and it is little wonder that service further down the chain is so poor. Email correspondence prior to our stay was either ignored or, when chased, answered abruptly. In the main, it was ignored, including one or two essential questions. Perhaps try booking the shuttle by email in advance of your stay - but no guarantees! The shuttle service gets booked very quickly but is useful. Pool was (sadly) closed when we went so can't comment. Dinner very overpriced - about \u00a330 a head for a buffet. Restaurant Pamphilli, the nearest, was acceptable, with lovely staff who were friendly and eager to please - a great contrast to the hotel! Basically, this is a nice hotel in the physical sense. It just needs a staffing overhaul. I have never left a hotel so disappointed and was happier at all the cheaper hotels, hostels and campsites we stayed at for the remainder.

I've stayed three times since then and think it's wonderful. The reception staff is superb, always helpful, kind and professional. The hotel restaurant is elegant yet comfortable for any reasonable attire, with a very respectable menu and wine selection. Buffets offered for breakfast and dinner are abundant, and a good value for restaurant eating in Rome. Room service is prompt. The wait staff is exceptional, offering quick, professional, helpful and very friendly service. This is a plus since the hotel is set in a tranquil park and there are no other restaurants in easy walking distance. However, a quick cab ride can take you to a wide variety of eateries, and the center of Rome is easily accessible. The hotel offers free shuttles to the Vatican area, where there is a large selection of restaurants and shopping, and access to the metro system. At certain times of year, another shuttle to Rome center is offered. The pool is huge and beautiful, and the tennis courts are popular. As a single traveler, I must say that the staff took particular care to make my stay as pleasant as possible. The location is quiet with a beautiful view over the park, and rooms are comfortable and well-appointed. There is a business center with computer access, and high-speed internet service available in the rooms, but through a service to which you must subscribe for a small fee, which would be my only criticism. However, as it is so simple to get pay-as-you-go mobile internet access in Italy now (stores are even in the airport), this is hardly an issue any more. During my visit in October 2009, I heard that a hotel spa was soon to open. On-line reservation service offers several types of discounted room rates, making this a great value.

The rooms are large and comfortable (ask for an executive room) have large comfortable beds, beatiful furnishings and decor. But the management lets it down. We booked an executive room at extra cost, but were surprised to see a tiny shower cabin instead of a luxury bathroom with bathtub as advertised. It took a lot of time to finaly change the room. Other guests then told us that upon arrival they received a free upgrade to an executive suite, while we payd the double and had to suffer. On the first days of our stay the hotel was full with tourist groups and the buffet breakfast was fantastic with a variety of salads, fresh fruits, hot dishes, freshly squeeze orange juice, choice of italian coffees and italian bakery and deserts.. delicious. We thought we would spoil ourselves every day. But after 2 days everything changed, the groups left, and the waiters took a leaf, instead in the restaurant worked only one very unfriendly manager. He started by shouting at me when I approched the coffee machine: seat down and dont stand up any more, you'll break it! only I can make coffee!! Well, Ok. but may i look at the buffet? yes. But there was no buffet. All the hot items disappeared. There remained some cold salads that remained from the previous days and stale bread. No fruit. No eggs. And everyday we saw only same stale items that remained from the group feast of the previous weak, plus this unpleasan man who eyed me to check that I dont make an extra cup of coffee. What a shame for a 4 star hotel! The same is valid for leisure facilities: the pool is closed in winter, so is the terrace. The restaurant got empty and I felt ill at ease sitting alone in the piano bar. Getting to the positive: the hotel provides a free shuttle to Vatican (10 min) every half hour, so it did, the drivers very polite and provided the service even when we were alone on the bus in heavy rain and never failed by pick us up from Vatican to bring back to the hotel. If you think it is far, I should say the location is not a problem, shuttle is fast, and from Vatican you can walk to the city centre, taxis are not so expensive, and anyway its hard to find a comfortable hotel in the historic part of Rome for a reasonable price.

Because of this we only used the bus to get to town, we arranged our own way back. The bus only runs until about 10:30 in the evening. We came back on the number 8 tram from Argentina Plaza - costs one euro, runs until midnight. You must be prepared for a 1.5 mile walk up and down 2 hills though. We managed it!

We booked this hotel through hotels.ca site and got the weekly rate for $800CDN dollars, a deal in our mind. Given some of previous reviews we were prepared for a moderate hotel and in our minds we were pleasantly surprised in many ways. We arrived and our reservation was acknowledged as being for 2 people when we had indicated 3, no problem, they quickly got a roll away bed/cot up to the room and we were set. Our room did show some signs of aging, the bathroom was clean but could do with some refurbishing, the room itself was in good shape but you could see that it would be due for a renovation in the next 12 months. They were busy renovating the public spaces while we were there. We did eat at the hotel, breakfast was included and was a nice variety of fruit, cheese, bread, eggs, meat and juices. We certainly got our fill at breakfast to offset the need for lunch. We did use the free shuttle on several occassions, as others have written, there are only 26 spots and once they hit the max there is no more space to allow for standees. We did encounter on a couple of instances where the bus was full and had to leave others behind either at the hotel or at the city drop spot. There can be a bit of a mad rush for the bus doors and even though you may be first in line, this order is not always adhered to, so be aware that you may need to exert yourself as there is little organization regarding the queue. We did use the pay bus service, $3 Euro per seat each way, keep in mind that if you do not book a return time/seat that the service may not come as it is driven by reserved seats, so even though a time may be scheduled, if no one has requested a seat on that scheduled run, the bus will not come. We used the internet in both the room and the business center, better value in the room but not as responsive as using the business center. We had dinner twice at the hotel, it can be expensive and I agree to stay away from the buffet and instead select the one or two items from the ala carte menu, similar price but you get what you want, anyway you slice it the price of food at the hotel can be expensive, and as others have mentioned there are no close by options for dinners. We used the pool most days and it was marvellous, large and clean, you have to wear bathing cap in the pool. The hotel was exactly what we were looking for, reasonably priced, clean, accomodating to our needs, the staff were very helpful, the front desk staff and Paolo the maitre'D in the restaurant.

The hotel is just outside the city centre, and is a fantastic escape from the bustle of the city at the end of long days sightseeing. ROOM: The rooms are large, with plenty of storage, a large comfortable bed and a spacious balcony complete with table and chairs. There was minor cosmetic damage to our room, but otherwise we were very impressed. The bathroom has a full bathtub and shower, and there were sufficient towels and complimentary toiletries. BREAKFAST: Is a buffet and quite expensive, though we ate plenty as it was usually too hot for lunch (except ice cream!) so it was good value in the end. Everything you'd want was available, fruit, cake, bread, meats, cheeses, and hot bacon, egg and sausage daily. All cooked well and replenished quickly. RESTAURANT: As others have noted, it is very pricey. However, order specific courses from the menu as the buffet is not very appetising. However the a la carte menu was fantastic with good portions. However, eat in Rome whenever possible as the food is amazing and very reasonable if you stray off the tourist streets. FACILITIES: The pool was fantastic and we spent a full day on the loungers by the side. The pool area has just been refurbished and is really fantasic, peaceful and surrounded by plants and views. Pool opens from around half 8 to around half 7 each day, is fully staffed and towels are provided poolside by staff. SHUTTLE: The hotel is not within walking distance of Rome, but the hotel puts on shuttle buses througout the day. An hourly (free) bus is available to the Vatican area of Rome, and although it fills up fast, there were always enough seats when we wanted to travel. Another, less frequent (\u20ac3/person/journey) bus is available to central Rome, and although this is a paid service you book a seat and therefore are guaranteed a seat and it's much cheaper than a taxi. For the more adventurous, the tram is within walking distance but the public transport system in Rome leaves much to be desired: dirty, confusing, irregular and extremely overcrowded (from our limited experience).

If you do get stuck at the hotel and have to call a cab, I would recommened calling it yourself.

We booked the family room and another individual room. Both were large, well furnished, very comfortable, and clean, with balconies furnished with a table and 2 chairs. Large bathrooms, stand-up shower and tub. We most enjoyed the large, clean swimming pool, and quiet time on the balcony. Some staff were friendly and willing to help us. Others acted put upon. Breakfast was included in the room price. There was ample food, including scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon. However, in Europe we learned that only in America can you get really crispy bacon. Fresh-squeezed orange juice was a hit with the kids. Otherwise, standard European breakfast: cold cuts, croissants, fruit, yogurt, cereal, a toaster (until they run out of bread, which happened every day, well before the 10:30 end time). Nice do-it-yourself coffee machine with lots of choices. The restaurant staff is helpful and somewhat friendly. They serve a lunch and dinner buffet for 28 Euros per person. The food in no way has the quality to warrant such a high price. We had to eat dinner the first night, but were not at all impressed. There is room service, however, when we ordered chicken bites and vegetable soup at lunchtime they said it would take an hour, so we canceled the order. The 2 shuttle van stops are near the Vatican Museum and Trastevere train station. The Vatican shuttle stop is next to a Metro stop - very convenient! More than once we had to wait 1/2 hour at the Vatican for the next shuttle back to the hotel as there were too many people to fit. The vans hold 16 - 19 people. We would either go down the block to get a Gelatti (ice cream), and wait, or walk up the block to the Taxi stand. Taxi fares from town to the hotel varied from 9 to 16 Euros, depending on your location. A Cab ride to either the airport or Termini train station takes 30 minutes. TIP: Study where the metro stops are on your map of Rome. And try to get a bus schedule in advance to learn which busses go where. Take the OPEN TOP bus tour to get an overview! Also, the restaurant down the block from the Vatican Shuttle stop, called \"La Rusticella\" is wonderful! Great food and wine, very friendly service and reasonable prices!

Although it is situated quite a bit outside Rome, the free bus service to Cipro metro station is extremely useful. The Roman metro is extremely handy and a week long ticket for unlimited use costs 16 Euro. Although it is advisable to queue for the bus at least 10 minutes in advance as we were left behind on certain occasions as there was no room. However, the drivers will often do a return run if there are people left waiting, especially late at night. The bus stop is also just a 10 minute walk from the Vatican Museums and a further 10 minutes from St. Peters. The rooms are decent if a bit small but the cleaners do a fantastic job every time. A big advantage of the hotel is the very large pool with complimentary towels. The breakfast buffet is another big plus. However, with regards to meals in the hotel, I would strongly suggest not having lunch or dinner as the prices are far too expensive. There are several fantastic restaurants within five minutes of Cipro station (La Rustichella just opposite the church being my favourite) which are so much cheaper. One aspect of this hotel which did not impress me was certain staff members. While some were extremely polite and helpful, I found many to be slightly unwelcoming and almost rude. The staff at reception were sometimes very abrupt in dealing with us while at breakfast, I don't think we received a \"buon giorno\" at all, we were just told where to sit. But because we were out and about pretty much all day every day, our dealings with staff was minimal. If you are coming to Rome to get out and about all day then I would definately recommend this hotel. However, unless you have money to burn, meals in the hotel (apart from breakfast) is not recommended.", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201csightseeing and relaxation by the pool - 2 holidays in one\u201d", "Author": "Elizabeth065", "ReviewID": "UR34922960", "Content": "Myself, my sister and two nieces (15 and 16) stayed here for 6 nights.

It was grand to then get on the metro and go off for the evening, or walk to the Vatican. Although the bus was rather full on some evenings, a phone or two and the hotel provided an extra bus on some of the nights.

Taxi is about \u20ac15 to the hotel if you miss the bus. Pool = great. they provide towles and hats and loungers with little shades on them; marvellous for reading and sunbathing without the glare. Clean bathrooms and rooms. Food and drink far too expensive (4.50 euro for a small coke). I got the room on first floor right above the entrance and it was quite noisey. However, they switched us to a room right above the bar, which was only a little noisey, but quietened down by 12.00. Next time i would ask for a room on one of the higher floors.

I booked through expedia. Well, we were very surprised at our booking at this hotel. It is a very nice hotel in the ATA Hotel chain. It has all the amenities of a 4+star hotel. Our room was ready when we checked in and we were very pleased with it. There were two single beds a table and big balcony with a table and seats. The bathroom was big with tub and toilet/bidet. The room was clean and housekeeping did a great job each day we were there... ALSO, I almost forgot they do the nightly turn-down service with the chocolate left bedside. We felt pampered at this hotel. The room had a big plasma with internet access through the TV and in-room movie's (check prices! - if you need to access internet and print anything like maps then go down to business centre on -1 level where you can use it for an hour for 5euro and print away!). The hotel has a HUGE swimming pool open from 9:30 - 19:30. Swimmers are required to wear swimming caps and they even provide them for free. The pool is great, especially after a long hot day walking around Rome. We wished the hotel would keep the pool open later than 19:30 in the summer especially since the sun doesn't set until 21:30 or so. The hotel offers a free shuttle van service to and from two destinations - one the northwestern edge of vatican city near the Cipro Metro stop (red line) and the other at a train station at the south of the city centre. The hotel staff provide upon check-in a map of Rome. On this map is information about the shuttle van service and pick-up/drop-off times. The driver's we experienced did not speak english well at all. They were quite funny when yelling \"Mama-Mia\" when a scooter would cut them off in traffic. They got us around safely during our stay and so I appreciate their efforts. Quick note about the vatican - Ladies must wear appropriate clothing to enter St. Peter's. No sleeveless attire (bring a silk scarf for your shoulders in your bag on hot days), no swimsuits and no short-shorts for ladies. The security will deny entry to anyone improperly dressed. As for getting around Rome you cannot beat the 1euro fare on the Metro and buses... you get to travel for up to 75mins on a 1euro ticket - this is GREAT! Walking around is fun, but also doing a bit of traveling by Metro meant we got to see a bit more of the city and its' sights. We had the buffet breakfast each morning and it was big. Plenty to choose from, a few types of eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, cereals and some other hot food items. They also had this great orange juice machine. You pulled on the handle and a few oranges dropped into this crusher and then my glass was filled - and it was the BEST juice I had on my enitre four week holiday around Europe! The staff at breakfast were very friendly and anticipated our drink selections each morning after the first breakfast. Everything at breakfast was perfect. The hotel also has free parking for guests - which came in VERY handy for our trip to Rome. If you are driving into Rome you should consider staying here as driving around Rome is a nightmare! One way streets all over the place and not so very polite drivers. Sort of like something you'd see on the old Benny Hill show.

It is approx 3km from the Vatican and a similar distance from Trastevere - so a 10 - 13 euro taxi ride. However, its location in a rolling park area of Villa Doria Pamphili means that it is really quiet and tranquil. My previous stay in Rome 10 years ago was in a city centre hotel - and the sound of traffic was unbearable. In Hotel Pamphili, I slept like baby. And the restaurant - although a typical hotel restaurant, the service which was excellent and the food which was delicious (try the insalata polpino with orange!).

Staff were excellent and supplied us with map with all the sights on on our arrival. The hotel runs 2 shuttle bus's to 2 destinations all day from very early in the morning. The one bus drops you right outside the underground metro station which is easy to use and cheap! We caught these shuttle buses every day and only had problems on two days.

This was the best hotel we have stayed at as far as amenities although the location is a bit out of the way.

We consider ourselves to be friendly, easy-going people, and are not prone to giving places negative reviews. However, we felt compelled to write this review after we were ignored, treated rudely or snobbishly, or given lesser treatment than italian speakers or even people from the UK. This should simply not happen at a 4 star place, but it almost seemed like there was a culture of negativity towards north americans. If you are like me, the way you are treated by hotel staff can either make or break your stay. Some examples: being ignored on a number of occassions by restaurant staff when others were provided with attentive service; being accused of trying to \"cue jump\" because you intervened to help a UK couple communicate with a waitress; consistently being addressed in an unsmiling, stern manner by front desk and restaurant staff; having urgent requests for cabs \"sat on\" for several minutes, causing us to miss a train, and come close to missing another.

I was there with my wife and 5 yr old son. We've been to Europe a few times and are fortunate to travel quite a lot. Pros - 1. You should get a quiet night's sleep as there is no street noise (however, we could hear the unit above leaving early for the airport one morning). 2. Huge pool (although no atmosphere down there and mandatory use of swim caps that they provide and no shallow end for little kids.) 3. Free breakfast buffet (I think this is common in European hotels) 4. The staff is pretty friendly (except for the front desk crew - more on that in a minute) 5. 80% of rooms face towards the pool area and 100% have decks. 6. Clean bathrooms in rooms. 7. Free Shuttle bus service into Rome (but, not always on time - more on that in a minute) 8. Price of about $200 US/per night reasonable value in Rome. Cons 1. Location - you are definitely not going to walk to anything. It's in a strange little suburb on the outskirts of Rome. 2. Finding the place in a rental car - this was a complete disaster that I can laugh about now. i tried following the directions on their website to no avail. if you are coming in from the North keep in mind that Via della Nocetta is one way going North! There is no sign indicating where Via Leone XIII is. (getting on it actually feels like a highway on-ramp) I was so desperate that I wound up going the wrong way down the one way street with Italians yelling at me! Ha! Another car ahead of me shared the same fate and was trying to go backwards! Terrible signage. (this hotel appears to cater to seniors on bus tours.) I mentioned this to the front desk staff and was met with bored, smiling looks. 3. Indifferent hotel staff at the front desk - we tried to change rooms upon arriving because they gave us 3 single beds. the young girls behind the counter need more training. every request is met with the untrue mantra, \"sorry we are all full tonight,\" with forced smiles. I spoke to the manager and got moved the following night. 4. The free shuttles into Rome are on Europe time. The shuttle is on a posted schedule so one morning we went down at 10:05am to catch the 10:15am shuttle. It showed up at 10:25am and then we all jumped in along with some American seniors. We sat there while the driver then had to have his smoke break. Ha! The other shuttle bus showed up and there was some confusion and we jumped into that second bus instead which wound up leaving right away. Man, those angry seniors almost started a riot because they got left behind in the other bus! One old timer pounded the side of the bus with his fist! (It's about a 15 Euro taxi ride into town.) 5. No internet access. There is a bizarre Atari looking console at the base of the stairs. While we were there they had a sign that said that there was a weird new law that precluded them from offering internet services. 6. The place could use some new carpeting and a splash of paint. It has a early 80's feel to it. 7. No English newspapers offered. 8. We got back to our room around 4:45pm one day and our room had not yet been cleaned. As an aside - we flew out of Ciampino airport. It took us 33 minutes to get there without traffic and without getting lost. The front desk said an hour. Ciampino has very few amenities. I should have checked in my baggage with Ryan Air 2.5 hrs ahead of time and then driven in my rental car to a lunch place nearby and returned with 30 minutes to go. We were stuck there for about 4 hours as the flight was delayed. It's a tiny airport and you can get through pretty quick. It's a lot of hurry up and wait there. I do not believe I will stay here or fly down with Ryan Air again. Believe it or not, I do not consider myself that picky a traveller. Keep in mind no one does service like Americans do.

It is such a shame too, because it was probably THE place to play a few years ago. That being said, this hotel obviously also caters to small conventions as well. It is located just on the outskirts of Rome. Literally, it is on the perimeter of chaos and tranquillity. Nice place! They have a free shuttle every thirty minutes that drops/picks-up on the edge of the Vatican where there is the tube/subway to get to everything else. The rooms are huge, clean, beautifully appointed and comfortable. The A/C in our room was awesome. Controlled by us. There is a private balcony overlooking either the pool or the gardens. The bathrooms are huge, clean, comfortable and have good water pressure, temperature and flow in the shower. Luxury. The lobby is beautiful with helpful staff. Nice bar.
