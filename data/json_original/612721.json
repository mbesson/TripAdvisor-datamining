To be more direct, it is downright misleading and not true, especially considering the fact that downtown Montreal is as distant from the airport as this property.. Arriving at 9PM and departing at 6AM, it took between 20-25 minutes, door to door. This was with no traffic whatsoever. The rooms are what you'd expect for the dollar. We got sort of a kick out of the restaurant's pretensions. White linen tablecloths, waiters in bistro aprons, AND portion control butter, ketchup, etc. The room is no more than moderately attractive, the service inadequate and the prices are much too high for the calibre of the food that is served. The property is located in a virtual wasteland, that is especially unattractive; seemingly in an enormous corporate/light industrial park. There is no public commerce [reatil restaurants, convenience stores, etc.] anywhere within walking distance.

Service: Don't expect Hilton treatment but the concierge desk employees were quite polite and the check in/check out process was smooth & easy. Comfort in room: The rooms were very clean (as with most Courtyard Marriotts). The only feature the rooms lacked was a security box. Other than that, I thought the rooms were very well equipped with a fridge and all toiletries available. Parking: Parking was free at this hotel Convenience: If you have a car, it is extremely convenient to get onto the highway. A drive to downtown was no more than 20-25 minutes away. There are many restaurants in the area nearby the hotel within walking distance (maybe less than 5 minute walk down the road) where you'll find nice restaurants such as \"Divinos\", or fast food restaurants such as McDonalds. If you go down the street and walk another 10 minutes, you'll find a pretty decent sized shopping mall with a food court inside, Zeller's and even a TD Canada Trust bank. Again, overall, if you're looking for a quiet, clean, comfortable and convenient place to stay, this is it! It also isn't very expensive to stay here. You can alway's find pretty good rates with hotels.ca :) P.s. the bar/restaurant at the hotel closes early. I believe the bar/restaurant was closed by 11pm.

I hung up and went to the Airport Information center and asked where to go for the Hotel Shuttle pickups and was directed to an area. After the Sheraton Shuttle driver told me that the Courtyard Shuttle would be by soon, I waited and waited only to have her tell me the next time she came around I had to call. So I then went back into the airport and called again from the kiosk and this time they picked up the phone right away and said the shuttle was almost there. I went out and got the shuttle right away. I was surprised at how far away the hotel was from the airport. It is located in a very mixed use area of light industrial with a small Movie and Restaurant complex within a couple of blocks walking distance. Another review complimented Rocco for his customer service and I received the same from him. Good job Rocco. The hotel I was told is only four years old and is really very nicely appointed everywhere. The two things that bothered me was the hallway noise was very loud through the gap under my room door and the bath mat was extremely worn and tattered. I took bath mat down with me when I checked out and asked for the onsite manager and was told that she was not there and that I could email her. The lady at the front desk did not understand what I was talking about and thought I was showing her how small the mat was, thinking it was supposed to be a bath towel. I then indicated the frayed edges and said that this was embarrassing for them to have such a tattered and worn bath mat in the room.

The bed is a comfort guarantee. Even though the room was on the freeway side the noise was non existent. Shuttle to and from the airport was free and the pick up and drop off very efficient.

Brought the family over and extended it for one more day...total days: 2. Didn't expect anything special as I've never stayed in Courtyards. Usually Hojo types. Building looked bland, so no big deal. Didn't expect anything anyway. But I was really tired from sitting beside my crying children, anything with a roof would have been heaven. Wife drove because I haven't slept but that's for another story...Imagine our surprise, when the automatic doors opened, and were greeted with a warm Bonjour from the front desk. Wow! Great reception hall, at least for its kind...priceline rated it at 2.5 stars...it should get at least a 3.5 for the reception hall. Off to the rooms, and noticed the halls are wide (not like Vancouver hotels)--which was a good thing because we had a double side by side stroller...opened the rooms..Wow! very clean, and well appointed rooms! I thought wow, we got this room for $89!?! What a [----] bargain! Very clean, very nice bathroom...loved the delta faucets. Wish I could get these for my house. Our toddler immediately lit up and ran back and forth in the room... bounced up and down the bed. You don't know how much it was a relief to rest after 6 hours driving. With these kind of appointments, my wife actually was able to take out the clothes and use the drawers... she never use them because she says they're all \"icky\"...but here she was laying our clothes out, nice and folded. Complaints? Kids room in the basement is bland and nothing much in terms of activities there...well these are usually for business people, so I can't really blame the hotel...also our room window is facing the highway...the noise is not much, but its there and we hear some from the airport itself Overall, a great experience, family loved it...walked to the Spheron and checked out a small bistro there...great beef paninis and soup!", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huddersfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely but noisy.\u201d", "Author": "Billy Bird", "ReviewID": "UR8739577", "Content": "This is a relatively expensive hotel for an airport hotel.
