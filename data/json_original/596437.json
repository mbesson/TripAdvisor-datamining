Looking out the window there was a beautiful balcony covered in plants and small sculptures which was nice. When we came in they showed us the ruins inside the hotel which were stunning and brought us some juice. We had breakfast included which was nice, I don't think it was worth 15 euros to be honest, its a little weird to have bacon and hot-dogs but no eggs? I read here that they make scrambled eggs but that was never offered to us. it was nicely presented but we both felt breakfast was lacking and for the style and rank of the hotel, it should be amazing. Besides that, the people who worked there were really nice and we felt very welcome. For the price, I may stay in the sister location by the Spanish steps next time but it was a cute hotel.

When you finally manage to find the hotel (only an open front door and small brass plaque mark the spot), it's absolutely lovely. The staff are friendly, efficient and helpful - especially the reception staff who ensured that all requests were dealt with quickly and made a great recommendation for where to eat (La Taverna dei Fori Imperiali, which is just around the corner and definitely worth a visit or two). There were lots of 5* touches - the hotel itself and its great location (5 mins from the Colosseum), the drink and fruit on arrival, the notes left in the room, and the lovely lounge room and terrace, the towels being replaced very regularly and the unrequested turndown service. We were in room 301 (the brown stripy 'executive' room), which was a good size and everything was in good condition - and importantly, the huge bed was really comfy. There were just a few (albeit minor) things that left a little room for improvement. Breakfast was a bit haphazard (but maybe that's just the Italian way..), you had to get hold of the waitress (sometimes a little elusive) to get coffee / tea and we didn't know until our second day that she offered what turned out to be very nice scrambled eggs, and cooked items seemed to disappear surprisingly quickly given the very limited number of guests. Although minor, little things like the ironing board being little more than a metal frame and one of the dressing gowns having seen much better days (when compared to the fluffy embroidered one from the day before) were made all the more obvious because everything else was so nice. The hotel can book taxi services for you from between the hotel and airport, we just booked online with click airport transfer for 80 euros (2 people, 2 medium and 2 small cases) and it took about 45 mins. A good professional service - in a mercedes sedan for a few euros more than the shuttle bus transfers available - definitely worth considering. All in all, I'd have no hesitations about going back to the Inn at the Roman Forum - we booked via lastminute.com and I think it's probably true in this case that you get what you pay for - but in my opinion it was worth it.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montagnola, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cA quiet oasis, but only steps from city center attractions\u201d", "Author": "Tom B", "ReviewID": "UR126349716", "Content": "We spent a nice weekend at the Inn at the Roman Forum in a deluxe room. The Inn itself is a quiet oasis from the hustle and bustle of Rome, but it is just meters from the major attractions in the city center as well as Metro connections. It's location is both a curse and a blessing, as cab drivers have a little trouble finding it, and even those who know where it is have to leave you off a few steps from, and out of sight of the discrete entrance. The deluxe room was spacious, with a jacuzzi tub, and a large screen TV with many channels in English. The breakfast buffet was surprisingly nice, and the rooftop garden was a lovely place to enjoy it. The same garden was home to evening aperitifs, and served as a reading room/lounge during the rest of the day. Only a few little hiccups kept me from giving 5 stars--all of which were, however, addressed immediately by the staff. The staff were extremely helpful, most especially Ivano at the front desk.

The wi-fi worked as promised and our car was waiting for us at the airport when we arrived. The garden area outside our 4th floor room was also a very nice touch.

To start, the inn is gorgeous in its decor throughout, and the cryptoporticus behind the reception was fascinating. Our room (401) was on the top floor with direct access to the garden. Other than some hedges requiring minor pruning (in order to get to the garden without getting touched) the garden was gorgeous - shame it was covered in snow for 3/5 days we were there. Our room was very comfortable with the most gigantic bed I have ever seen - maybe a California King? The bed linens were actually linen - a lovely touch. I would have preferred a duvet to a comforter (for hygiene reasons - duvet covers are removable), but the bedding was very attractive. The wrought iron canopy bed was adorned with curtains, the walls were fabric covered and the chandelier added wonder sparkle and elegance. I also liked the eclectic blend of furnishings. The 5 piece bath was very nice, the jacuzzi tub was fantastic and I made good use of it. The only drawback for this specific room was a ventilation issue, so the bathroom would get and stay very humid. There is a window in the bathroom, but since it was around 0 C/30 F, we couldn't open it for long without getting too cold. As a result of the humidity, there are some mould issues that need to be addressed - this is my only complaint of any weight (although the service more than made up for this). The breakfast buffet was very nice - we usually did not get hungry until about 2pm because we had plenty to eat before venturing off. The evening spread was also fantastic - between the late lunches and the bad weather, 3 of the five nights I just ate a light snack there rather than going out for dinner (I also don't like dining late in the evening). The location is fab - easy walk to the Forum, Trjan's Market, Colosseum and the Coloseo Metro station. I would recommend taking advantage of the car services if you are flying into Rome - Taxi is 40 Euro (plus 1 Euro per bag) or the car service is 50 Euro and you have recourse if anything goes wrong (i.e. corrupt cab drivers). The internet was liable - the code systems was a little annoying, but made sense since this way you pay for 24 hours of actual usage (and not a 24 hour window of time).

They recommended tours for us, including a spectacular guided tour in a beautiful air-conditioned Mercedes that allowed us to see in one day what it would take most people a week to see. They arranged for our special needs. They bought us groceries from a local store that we needed for snacks. They clued us in to the best nearby restaurants. They were, in fact, the heroes of our vacation, along with all the other excellent staff at the Inn. We arranged to get into the room early so we had a place to crash at 11am following a flight.

Upon checking in we were shown to the hotel's own Roman ruins and were also given a cold fresh beverage. We were shown two rooms and given our choice of the two. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The hotel's location was very convenient to many of the sights in Rome and not too far (maybe 5 minutes walk) from a subway stop. The hotel was also tucked back in a quiet street so in addition to being convenent to all of the attractions around the ruins and the Coliseum, it was also peaceful. We took advantage of the happy hour offered each evening, and it was a nice way to relax before heading back out for dinner. The roofdeck terrace was very nice. The downsides, while small, were that instead of a double bed, we were given two singles pushed together (we found this to be true of many of the hotels we stayed in) and the AC was not yet turned on in the building so the rooms were a bit warm until late in the evening when they'd had a chance to cool naturally.

Friends of ours recently spent \u00a3200 a night on extremely tacky accommodation. You need to put prices into perspective, are you content to pay \u00a3200 a night or do you want to spoil yourself? If the answer is the latter, you will need to pay and pay dearly. The Inn at the Forum is not cheap by international standards; we paid around 400 Euros a night which at current exchange rates is nearly \u00a3350 a night. Was it worth it, well we believe it was. The hotel is small; I think they only have about 10 rooms. It is away from the hustle and bustle of the Centro Storico which is where most of the main tourist sites are. Having said that, it's not far, you can walk to the Trevi Fountain in around 15 minutes and we never paid more than 10 Euros in a taxi to go anywhere, even late at night when fares are higher. The staff are extremely well trained and efficient but in a friendly way. Our room was the Master Garden Suite which is very nice. The garden is shared with one other room but when we were there, no one else used it so it making it a lovely place to read a book or relax with a drink after a long day sightseeing. The room was large and the bathroom, though a little crowded (who uses a bidet these days?) was fine. The shower was good and the Jacuzzi bath is great for relaxing in. Breakfast is good with lots of fresh fruit and the usual croissants and sticky buns. There was even bacon and scrambled eggs which is rare in anything but the top international hotels in Rome. You can take breakfast on their terrace which is small but doesn\u2019t have a great view, unless you are a trying to tick off the last few TV aerials in your Eye-Spy book that is. Others have said that it is difficult to find and in an area covered in graffiti. I suspect they must have led a very sheltered existence. The area is not threatening and you very quickly find your way back. Our only problem was the car that they booked to collect us from the airport. I don\u2019t think it had been booked and we had a frustrating half an hour while they arranged for another car. In the end it didn\u2019t matter and they sorted it very quickly but if you had come off a trans-Atlantic flight, rather than from London as we had, you would have been pretty pissed off. Generally, we had some very indifferent and over-priced food in Rome. However, just around the corner is a very nice and reasonable priced restaurant called, I think, Mario\u2019s which was popular with locals and tourists alike. Further up the street is a fish restaurant which although very good was also very expensive. One of the highlights of our trip was having sun downers at the rooftop bar (The American Bar?) at the Hotel Forum which is a short walk from the Inn at the Forum. The view is great and you can enjoy the sun going down over the Forum. Again drinks are not cheap (15 Euros for a G&T and 6 Euros for a beer) but that is considerable less than we paid downtown and at least it keeps the riff-raff away!

Another excellent thing about the location is that its located on a side street completely removed from the busy roads, traffic noise, and steady stream of pedestrians. It IS a bit pricey but the rooms, location, etc make it worth the price in my eyes. Also, the breakfast was fantastic and the server always went out of his way to make sure we had what we wanted.

For some reason, they thought it would be a good idea to renovate the room above us beginning at 6 AM!

It is advertised as 5 star boutique. The area around the Stazione was as 'lively' as ever and we lept in a taxi to get away from that area of Roma as quickley as possible. The taxi driver had no idea where the hotel was and delivered us to a different one before driving aimlessly about and then dumping us at the end of an alley pointing with a lack of enthusiasm to a dusty lane. The hotel looked boutique from the outside. The sign on the door tiny and the reception small but that's what boutique is all about. That is what we had wanted and that is what we had booked. We were only glad that in a few minutes we would be able to take a shower. Our passports were taken and our credit card was immediately swiped (for extras). I fear our problems started because we had prepaid many months ago for the room itself. We were invited to have a look around the Roman ruins at the back of the hotel whilst we were checked in. Very interesting but we wanted to get to our room and change. After our polite wander around the ancient walls at the back, and after our credit card had been fully processed we were told that there was good news and bad news. The bad news was apparently that a baby had got an ear infection, could not fly and so we had no room to stay in (by sheer coincidence the last time I was 'bumped' in London it was a baby with an ear infection - how strange). The good news they said was that we would be taken to a sister hotel where we would get a jacuzzi bath. The sister hotel was around the corner. It wasn't. It was a 4 star 'contemporary' offering in the area around the Stazione. I had booked a 5 star near to the forum as we needed to be near the forum for the evening we had planned. A 4 star in an area which reminds me of Kings Cross in the 80's was not what I wanted. It was not what I had booked many months before. It is still a mystery why were we not told this immediately on arrival. We were told there were no 5 star hotels available. I immediately made some enquiries myself and found a number of 5 star hotels with rooms all over Rome. We were told that we had to stay within their group of hotels. I infomed them this was not acceptable as there group had nothing equivalent available. We were then offered a room in the hotel itself but when we got to it we were told the air conditioning had broken down. They could put a machine type thing in perhaps. We declined. We were finally booked into a hotel across town which my wife wanted us to take just to get us out of there. However when the taxi turned up we were told that there was something happening which meant taxis would not go into that area. We could, we were told, be probably taken somewhere and then walk through the streets of Rome until we found it. By now I was annoyed. I told the receptionist that I wanted a room in a 5 star hotel near the forum which is what I had contracted for. We were told again that there were none. At this I had to go onto the internet myself and surprise surprise I found one within minutes. A room in a 5 star boutique hotel near the forum. Nothing happened for sometime. We were then told there were issues with the price. It has to be said that in dealing with this matter we felt sorry for the girl on reception. The manager who appeared only after some time, and a specific request to speak to someone, looked annoyed that we should have turned down her Stazione jacuzzi offer and kept disappearing into her office leaving the receptionist to fend off our not unreasonable enquiries as to what was happening when it appeared nothing was being done. The manager's attitude was appalling and disgraceful. Everything seemed to be too much trouble. There was no effort to help. The hotel were in the wrong. Mistakes happen, things happen but they should have done all they could to put matters right. It was left to me to do it all. Eventually I insisted on being taken to the hotel that I had found on the web. Further delay took place before they eventually gave in. It was now about 2 hours since we had arrived in Rome. I am pleased to say that at the new hotel we were treated properly. We will certainly return to that hotel. It seemed to appreciate that 5 star hotel required 5 star service, and attitude, and common decency and good manners. We will never set foot in the Inn on the Forum, or it's sister hotels - jacuzzi or not. I have emailed the hotel on 3 occasions asking for the details of a director in order to complain. I have had no response.

We were also told upon reservation that if we were interested in booking a private tour to the Vatican that we could do so with a call to the concierge. We tried this and all they did was send us to the Vatican website so we could do everything ourselves. When we arrived, we found out why. They don't have a concierge. In fact, we only saw that they had 2 staff at the hotel. When we asked for something simple like a location where we could ship souvenirs back to the US, they referred us to the internet as they didn't know. We then had to purchase their wireless internet for 10 Euro to find our way. Not helpful whatsoever. Couple of other things to be aware of: 1) the rooftop terrace doesn't have much of a view, although they will tell you otherwise, 2) taxis will no pick you up or drop you off in front as it is in an alley (you have to walk down a set of stairs outside to get to another small road where a taxi still gets lost), and 3) local residents tend to congregate just outside the hotel at all hours talking and smoking around the scooters they park in front of the hotel entrance. Now, the rooms were nice, the bed was comfortable, and bathrooms were plenty big. If that is all you are interested in it could be a nice place for you. But if that is all you are interested in, why would you pay 350 Euro ($500) a night? Oh, after the first night when we indicated we weren't pleased with what we paid for and found a better hotel for half the price, they proceeded to charge us the FULL amount of the 3 nights we had booked before we could leave.

We took advantage of the free nibbles with drinks one night and ended up eating some simple but delicious pasta in the upstairs bar/dining room. Service was fantastic, even though it was more of a couples type place our daughter was made very welcome. We felt like we had discovered a great secret and would highly recommend it. We also got a pretty competitive rate via Hotel.com for such a lovely place - if you go to Rome stay there!", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay in friendly, clean hotel in great location.\u201d", "Author": "LauraLLondon", "ReviewID": "UR61076014", "Content": "We stayed at the Inn at the Roman Forum for 5 nights in March this year and had a wonderful stay.

If you thinking of going to Rome, DO IT!! FANTASIC CITY, now for the hotel..........Great location within walking distance of most attractions, maybe a little far from the Vatican but you can't have everything. The hotel offer an afternoon snack which is free of charge which I thought was a lovely touch. Although our room was well decorated, it was absolutely tiny to the point where we were bumping into each other. There was no place to put your make up on or do your hair unless you were happy to put your make up bag in the wet sink. We had a brilliant view of a brick wall, which most of the rooms do and our room was right below where they serve breakfast, noisy isn\u2019t the word, we didn\u2019t mind as we intended to be up early but if you want to relax then stay away, the floors are marble so very noisy when people were walking above us at 6am serving breakfast. The plug in the bath didn\u2019t work, which is totally only a minor thing but I love to have a relaxing bath so it was an issue for me personally when after 3 minutes of sitting in the bath you were left sitting in a bath with no water and just bubbles! Great. So we asked for it to be fixed and guess what 2 days later we were still waiting. (we were only there for 4 nights) Eventually they changed our room and it was 10x better than the standard room so for anyone going who wants a bit of space to move or to do some ironing or simply getting ready without bashing into each other, I would only recommend this hotel if you upgraded your room. The male staff members were absolutely lovely and so helpful especially the gentleman who serves the afternoon snacks, the only female member of staff there was a different story, she was the rudest person I have met in my life and over breakfast we heard other guests complaining about how rude and abrupt she was. When I told her our bath plug was not working she called me a liar and said I was making it up!! Not the sort of service you expect in a 5* hotel.

We were there for four nights and walked almost everywhere - even to and from Roma Termini! We had advance-booked a deluxe room, and were lucky enough to get upgraded to a master garden suite; this room was certainly 5-star - at least by European standards. The room itself was fairly large with a firm king bed, desk, and armoire, and had a full-featured bath with tub, shower, dual sinks, and tons of counter space - well beyond my normal expectation for a hotel in the center of a large european city. Breakfast was provided, along with an afternoon snack; the normal continental breakfast was enhanced with scrambled eggs, bacon, and quiche - again, better than average. Service here was perfectly fine, with one minor glitch; apparently, they had trouble with their keycard system. Thus, we were unable to get a keycard for our room and had to pick up the master from the desk when we came in, and leave it when we went out. Not a big deal (in fact, it reminded me of the days when hotel keys were attached to large, heavy objects), but it seemed a bit unusual. The desk clerk's recommendations for restaurants were solid, if a bit high-priced (to be expected from this level of hotel), and they got everything right when making reservations for us or scheduling transportation. Without the key issue, the service would have been perfect. My only significant negative for this property is the price. We were delighted with the room we got, but we would not normally pay the on-season price for that level of hotel. We got a great deal because we booked off-season and got lucky on the room choice; while it was a great stay for us, I have my doubts that we would be so lucky on a return booking - we might not be equally happy with a lower-level room.

Comfy bed too, and very quiet room in the middle of Rome.

Other little touches included a gift of bulgari perfume and free airport transfers (for those staying more than 3 nights). All in all, it is a great hotel, though quite pricey even compared to SF or NY hotels. The big complaint is about the front desk staff--we had asked for restaurant reservations well before arriving in Italy, and emailed multiple times for confirmation without getting any answers. Upon arrival they told us they had made reservations for us, but when we looked up one of the restaurants they booked us at we found out it was closed for August! They later booked us at a different restaurant, and when we arrived it was completely empty -- we decided to go to another restaurant rather than eat at an empty one. Finally we had asked them to book us at Casina Valadier, which I read about on Tripadvisor, to celebrate our anniversary. When we arrived at the restaurant they couldn't find the reservation, and luckily could seat us but not at one of the more desirable tables as those had been reserved in advance. If we are paying between $500-$700/night, I would expect the concierge to at least provide the simple service of booking restaurant tables for us for the few nights we are there!

We walked everywhere in the Ancient Center, found some great cafes for dinner close by, and enjoyed beginning each day with breakfast on the lovely rooftop terrace. Our room was meticulously maintained, glamourously decorated and totally charming. Staff was always warm and friendly, breakfast offered a perfect assortment of food and drink in a tranquil environment before beginning each day of touring a very hectic city; and we had the chance to chat with some wonderful fellow travelers while relaxing during evening cocktails in the rooftop lounge.

I am comfortable with the fact that one can go to a hotel and enjoy the stay and find a few things wrong... it's just how things tend to be. If you read my other reviews you can see that I will definitely give a four out of five if things are not perfect. To get a 5 the details need to be dealt with as well as the larger items. When a hotel does *everything* right, I think it's time to break out the five star rating. This hotel is in a great location, very close to the sights of ancient Rome (there is even a little bit of ancient Rome right inside the hotel). Checkin was quick and painless, the reception agent is multilingual, I heard her speaking French to the people before me, English to me and of course Italian. The room was beautifully appointed, just gorgeous. One of the best I've seen. For those who need it, there's a large LCD TV (though I did not turn it on), a very beautiful bathroom, and the shower was awesome (very high pressure with a \"rainfall\" showerhead... so very nice to come home to after a full day walking around in 30C heat and the Roman sun). The hotel is listed here as four star, but I have stayed in many four and five star places, and this is better than most places that want to claim five stars. Because of the location, space is at a premium so the elevator is basically a one person lift, and some things like the desk in the room are small... but these to me are a non-issue in a place like Rome. Seriously, I was just thrilled with the place. At night it was very quiet, with a beautiful and comfortable bed. And when I plugged my laptop in I found out that it had free internet. Wow. Finally a four/five star hotel \"gets\" it. Internet service is very cheap, and so many of these hotels scalp you by charging $10 or $20 or something per day to provide it. They view it as just another profit item, but here's a hotel who just considers it as a service to provide to their guests if they need it. Thank you very much. I will gladly stay at this hotel and any hotel operated by this company in the future. They honestly \"get\" it. As well, in the morning when I checked out I found I had misplaced one of my credit cards, and the same agent who checked me in immediately offered to call the restaurant I was at last night to assist me in getting my card back. It was there, and I got it back.... I love Italy, and I love this hotel. Kudos all around. I can recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone, I would send my parents here, I would stay here again, thumbs up, thumbs up, thumbs up. Lastly air conditioning can be pretty weak in Rome I've found, but this place the level is suitable. Again, just right. (Note on my photos, the washroom I shot the jacuzzi tub but didn't photograph the shower stall, it's to the left of the frame...)", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cB&B in Roma\u201d", "Author": "kingdom100", "ReviewID": "UR19568923", "Content": "Rome, like most large capital cities had a multitude of deluxe five-star properties to choose from. Instead of picking the usual international circa 150-room property I thought I would go for something more boutique. After reading through reviews on this web-site, and other sources, Inn At The Roman Forum sounded like the perfect choice - a five star hotel distilled into twelve individually designed rooms and very personal service. How wrong this turned out to be! As everyone else has stated, it is a difficult hotel for taxi drivers to find, but after having been driven around the block a couple of times we were there! The moment I saw the receptionist/concierge/... come out to take in the heavy luggage I knew things were not going to go smoothly. Maybe I should explain, when I arrive at the hotel I like to see a porter/doorman who is strong and looks just as/more capable of handling the baggage as I do and is employed expressly for that purpose. I do not expect someone to be multitasking. Others have commented that in a small hotel one member of staff may take on several roles, true, and that is fine, but NOT if a property purports to be five star and charges accordingly. Location is good for sightseeing and of course it is on top of the forum which is an awe inspiring part of the city. After the receptionist had sort of hauled one of my cases in, a boy who looked more like a porter of some description assisted with the rest of my luggage. I was kindly upgraded to a \"deluxe\" room. Upon check-in they ask you to sign an abnormal number of contracts - I have stayed in countless hotels and never have I seen such attempts in securing their position e.g. they took an imprint of my credit card and wanted me to sign a blank slip effectively giving them a blank cheque from myself. Even at this stage I did not trust them enough to do this and refused. It is details like this that distinguish a professionally run property from an amateur imitation. The room itself was on the ground floor, right by the entrance corridor so that you could hear all the comings and goings. Indeed, I had a sleepless night as the walls/ceilings are paper thin as noted by other reviewers here. Decor was a bit \"changing rooms\" over the top. Lots of cheap fabric draped over metal poles overhanging the bed, cheap fitted wardrobes, a badly installed bathroom, and tiles very badly laid throughout. It looked very pleasant in pictures, but in reality it was easy to pick flaws in it. Some might find me having overly high standards, but this is a five star property charging five star prices, at that level it is open to this sort of critique in the same way a three Michelin star restaurant raises the expectations of their diners; they simply have to be able to deliver! Also, the room was very dark with only a small window covered by a grill, onto the quiet street at the front. In fact, one might say it felt like a prison cell. There was a safety deposit box in the room that was just sitting in the wardrobe, no attempt had been made to secure it in any fashion so a sneaky thief could quickly walk in, pick it up and carry it out under his arm. This type of safe is not secure at the best of times, but is utterly pointless if no attempt is made to bolt it down! Bed had a very soft mattress, which again comes down entirely to personal preference, but I like something firmer, so if you have a bad back, once again beware. I complained about the room, and the receptionist arranged for me to be shown a couple of others. Both were of a lower grade and absolutely tiny. The \"classic\" room which I was shown with only a walk in shower (no bath) was miniscule and quite frankly a joke at the prices they charge. Again, lots of fabrics draped around for effect. Needless to say, I stayed in my original room. For fairness, I will mention that I was offered an \"executive\" room the following day, but I did not actually see the room so cannot comment on it. Most of the rooms look onto a narrow light well, that is anything other than light so had the same prison gloom in the air. All in all I was most disappointed with the rooms which did feel like ones in an upmarket bed and breakfast on the seafront of say Brighton or one of the trendier seaside resorts. They certainly did not have the style nor substance to be qualified as five star standard - some nice Etro toiletries, slippers and robes doesn't make a room five star. The early evening buffet was pleasant - a selection of olives, tomatoes, mozzarella, other cheeses, arancini, potato croquettes (not homemade), cold cuts and fresh fruit. This was taken on the top floor in what is probably the most stylish room there, a \"lounge\" for want of a better description. Lots of coffee table style books and coffee tables upon which to read them. The hotel was about 50% (possibly higher) occupancy, but I did not encounter any other guests, so this room had absolutely no atmosphere, rather like the rest of the hotel. A comment on this buffet is that it is very petty not to provide a bottle of water from which one might drink, instead charging you for any drinks. Of course one is not compelled to purchase any drinks, but if you are going to provide complimentary food, why not complete the whole \"experience\" and at least offer some water? Upon returning from dinner I arrived at the hotel to find a new receptionist/concierge/.... standing outside the hotel enjoying a cigarette whilst leaving the desk unmanned. Does one really expect to return to a five star hotel to find one of the staff having a fag outside? I raised this with yet another receptionist the next day who seemed bemused as to what my problem was. Incidentally I had asked this member of staff some basic questions (about the \"Rome card\" tourist pass, and Nero's house) about the local tourist attractions and he declined to answer and told me he would get back to me. I only expect a concierge in a five star hotel to decline to answer me if it is a complex, unique or unusual request, not something that is surely fundamental to any tourist, especially given the hotel's location! The garden is nowhere near as idyllic as the web-site photography makes it appear. It is pleasant enough, but feels more like a table and chairs, some trees and a bit of scrubby lawn rather than \"Eden\". In fact all the photography on the web-site is very flattering, taken from clever angles to add a sense of space, height and quality that just doesn't exist in reality. Breakfast was disappointing. This time I took it on the small terrace which is quite a pleasant space, but the lack of serving staff (one man occasionally coming out of hiding in the \"kitchen\" area) made it seem strange. Similar food to the evening buffet, but not as interesting and fruit wasn't as varied. Nothing of any great quality and the pastries were bog standard supermarket ones. By far the most disappointing breakfast I ate in Italy. I appreciate that this is a small property so it is not perhaps economical (although for the prices they charge, it should be) to order a vast amount of food that will go to waste, but some high quality patisserie, local cheeses (why have some plastic Dutch stuff when Italy abounds with superb cheeses?) and breads would be a perfect start to the day! After a sleepless night where every hour or so I could hear the receptionist traipsing outside for another fag, and the conversation of people in the room above I had had enough and wanted to check out. Unfortunately they have a cancellation policy requiring notice otherwise they charge for further nights regardless. The receptionist didn't speak wonderful English but I communicated that I wanted to check out and would pay for my sleepless night (In the past I have stayed in countless hotels and on the very rare occasion I have a sleepless night due to a fault on their part I have never been charged for it, and indeed have been offered a further complimentary one by way of apology) and I did not want to incur further charges. The receptionist first offered me the aforementioned \"executive\" room, I declined to view it as I just wanted to escape due to the stress of my experience so far. I was informed I would be charged for my sleepless night and the following night. I disagreed that this should be the case and the receptionist agreed to telephone her manager. Fifteen minutes later she said that I could leave and only pay for the night I had taken. A receipt was prepared charging me for one night, I signed a credit card slip charging me for one night. I once again verbally confirmed, most explicitly that I would not incur any further charges, this was confirmed. I felt that I had taken the utmost in way of precautions to ensure that I would not be billed for anything other than what I had signed for. At this stage I will say that whilst I was desperate to check out, I would not have left without having taken any nights I would have had to pay for. The hotel called me a taxi and I thought that my nightmare would be over. Upon returning to the UK I checked my credit card bill and the hotel and decided to charge me for an additional night. I telephoned to speak to a manager who was most unsympathetic to my cause. She said that she understood my point, but that was their policy and it was not up to her to offer any recourse as only the owner (who was/is on holiday) can do that. What five star hotel exhibits such dishonesty and penny pinching pettiness as this? What five star hotel offers nothing in way of customer service? I now have to rely on my credit card company recovering this for me. If you are looking for a five star hotel by any way or stretch of the imagination, this is not it. The staff is not professional enough, the decor and furnishing are not of an high enough quality, and the whole experience leaves a lot to be desired. To all those who think it is a \"hidden gem\" I can only hope that it stays that way. You see, if this had been a four star property, charging fair four star prices I might've had the same scenario and sequence of events happen, but have been more readily accepting of them. If one buys an ancient Roman relic and finds that it is in fact a 15th century imitation are they likely to be as satisfied with it? Overall it feels like a B&B and offers about as much professionalism and service as Fawlty Towers. After my torturous night I checked into a five star hotel that was also small (it had three times the number of rooms of this one, but that is still small) but had a professional staff and I did genuinely feel that it delivered a five star standard.", "Date": "August 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cAlmost too good to share\u201d", "Author": "thalgizouzle", "ReviewID": "UR18832953", "Content": "This is a small hotel tucked away on a small street facing the Roman Forum, just around the corner from the Piazza Venezia and just up the street from the colosseum.

Beverages are purchased separately. The staff Anthony and Pia go so far out of their way to take care of every detail. it was refreshing to meet people who are passionate about their jobs.

The hotel picks you up at the airport which is a real plus as saves struggling to find it especially at night. Very impressive location, I feel the Roman Forum area is a great place to stay as you are literally 300 yards or so from the Coluseum and the Metro (only has two lines) but saves your feet after a long day's sightseeing so everywhere worth seeing is within easy reach.

I did alot a research prior and decided on a char!ming boutique property over the grand contenental 5-stay style holel, and this did not let down. As a point of reference, we spent around $20,000 on this 10 day trip to Rome and Amalfi coast. I say this to give you perspective on our level of travel and expectations. I booked the master garden suite and they included an airport transfer. Having that private garden made our stay magical and I am glad that we did it, it was worth every penny if you can do it. There is no better way to end the night than a drink in your own garden. One day they brought us a bottle of Prosecco. Another thing we liked about the Master garden suite, is it is on the top floor, next to the public living room and breakfast terrace. Many times we felt like we had our own private villa. My only criticism of the room is that it could have had a better area for dressing. An antique armoire was all there was for clothing with no drawers or seperate area. At this price, you should not have to have your suitcases laid out on the floor! None the less, the room was gorgeous in every way, kind of hip antique style. Service and breakfast was consistantly good, especially the fritatta. The private ruins on site was a selling point for us as well. Staying here, we felt we had a very unique taste of Rome. One of the restaurants , Hildur recommended, Trattoria de Monti was our favorite meal in Rome. Lively and trendy setting with great updated food. Make sure to get a table in the room with the glass walled kitchen. We never had trouble getting cabs. After checking out the Inn at Spanish Steps, we are glad we chose the RF. I at the RF was in a quiet, but central location. We were able to walk everywhere. While we were there we had a fabulous private guide, Rosanna and a private driver, Stefano. We wanted to take Rosanna home with us. They made the trip unique and special. They were hired through Romanstrolls.com. Also, their prices were great compared with others.

The weather was some of the hottest I have ever experienced and I have been around the world many times and stayed in many top class hotels and this was among my top ever. I cannot fault it. The breakfast on the terrace at 0630 was perfect - selection of fresh fruit, cereals, juices, pastries plus a hot buffet selection. The terrace overlooks the Forum rooftops and is so peaceful first thing in the morning. We saw Rome on foot and this location is ideal. We hopped on the Metro for the Vatican - Tip: join the tour from the people that approach you in the line - saved us queing up for hours and was a brilliant way to get info and picked out interesting facts otherwise unnoticed. We ended up getting reception to call us cabs as it was far too hot to walk but then walked back taking in various sights later in the day. The Villa Borghese is incredible, the marble sculptures and mosaics breath taking. Hotel staff very approachable and helpful. Rooms sumptuous and cater for every comfort. Bathroom with jacuzzi for tired limbs. One suggestion for the hotel is not to change the towels so frequently (ours done 3 times in one day!) to be more \"Enviromentally friendly\". The afternoon snacks from 5pm to 8pm are a great welcome return from a dayssight seeing.

However, we were warmly greeted and given a tour of the part of the hotel where there are ancient ruins and remnants of one of the forums - I believe it was a part of the Trajan Forum, but don't hold me to that! I found this to be just extraordinary. We were further given a tour of the Inn and we were able to enjoy a cappuccino while sitting on the cozy outdoor terrace on the top floor overlooking Rome. There was some construction work being done nearby, which made things a little noisy now and then, but nothing disruptive. Otherwise, the Inn is situated in a very pleasant neighborhood where we never felt threatened by anything. All in all, I would never hesitate to stay at this Inn again.

We first learned about the hotel through Small Luxury Hotels, and booked it after reading good reviews on the Trip Advisor site. Prior to our arrival, we contacted the hotel by email to arrange car service from the airport. They confirmed the arrangements for us (58 euros payable in cash to the driver), and also noted that there could be an additional charge if we were delayed. As it turns out, our flight arrived about an hour late, but the driver was still waiting for us exactly where promised, and he delivered us to the hotel without any additional fees. On top of that, we were thrilled to learn that they had a room ready for us upon arrival, even though we got to the hotel about 10:30 a.m. on a Friday. That was welcome news after an overnight flight, and we very much appreciated being about the shower and refresh before heading out for a day of exploring the city. The first room we stayed in was located on the first floor, and was very nicely appointed. The iPod docking station was a particularly nice touch, as well as the bathroom amentities. Perhaps my only complaint about this room was the noise that we got from the hallway as people went in and out at night or in the morning. That shouldn't be a problem for those on any of the other floors. The second room we stayed in at the end of our trip was located on the rooftop level with a terrace opening out to the enclosed courtyard. This room was absolutely beautiful, even boasting an exposed brick floor. While there was no external noise from this room, the walls seemed to be extremely thin, as we could hear the people in the neighboring room cough all night long. Other than that, we really didn't have any complaints. The rooftop terrace is a delightful place to enjoy a cocktail and snack in the later afternoon after sightseeing and before heading out for dinner. It's also a great place to start your day with breakfast. As previous reviewers have noted, the hotel's location is on a small side street that we could never have found on our own. In addition to its proximity to the Colosseum and the Forum, it is easily within walking distance or a short cab ride to almost all of the ancient Rome attractions. Once you round the corner to the hotel, it's like being in your own little corner of the city without the noise and traffic, which was definitely a plus. The staff was very friendly, and ready to help whenever we needed something. We did have some problems the two times they called a cab for us, but the problems were on the taxi/traffic end of things, and were not the hotel's fault. In fact, we found it was just as easy to walk down the hill and around the corner to the Hotel Forum and catch a cab there. One caveat on the cab drivers in the city: while most of them are very pleasant and honest people, you will occasionally find one who is not. We had one driver palm the $20 bill my husband gave him and claim he had only handed him a $5. My husband promptly pulled out the additional money he thought he owed, along with a tip, then as I got out of the cab on the driver's side, I saw him pull the $20 out from underneath the pile of money. He looked up at me, smiled, and promptly pulled away. We travel quite a bit and are usually much more cautious about things like this. I can only attribute it to jet lag and a long day of exploring. Finally, initially we had concerns about staying in the city the night before flying out. Then again, we decided that we would much rather spend our last night of vacation enjoying what we could of the city. Again, we used the hotel's car service, and the driver was there promptly as scheduled on Monday morning. We even had time for a light breakfast before leaving, as the hotel's breakfast buffet opens around 6:30 or 6:45 a.m. We made it to the airport in plenty of time, and wouldn't hesitate to do it again.", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cLike having your own Villa in the heart of Rome!\u201d", "Author": "Ben B", "ReviewID": "UR7646799", "Content": "I stayed at the Inn at the Roman Forum for three nights during the beginning of May, 2007.

My suggestion, look at it on Google Maps or Google Earth first and you'll understand how to find it! Check in was prompt, even though we arrived around 10am, and we were given a beautiful king room.

A lot of people want to stay by the Spanish steps - but I think that's an over-rated location - noisy, touristy, commercial.
