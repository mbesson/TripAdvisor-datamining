It's a short drive from the airport, one of my favourite places was on our door step - Tim Hortons, I was in heaven!

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful from the reception to the maintenance and cleaning staff. The rooms are clean and surprisingly spacious for the price. I was really impressed with the quality to cost ratio. The location is the biggest selling point of this property. If you come in via Etihad Airways coach service the depot is in the same building. The Dubai Metro station is right out side of the hotel. The Metro is a great way to get to the other parts of Dubai such as the Mall of the Emirates and the Marina area, as well as the airport. There is a great restaurant attached to the hotel that is also a great value with delicious Middle Eastern cuisine. The only downside for me was the lack of a bar. If you want a cocktail with your dinner you will have to go elsewhere. And the increasingly common practice of charging for internet access. At around a hundred and fifty dollars a night, you'd think they could throw in internet service.

Great drive from the airport. Booked a 2 bedroom and asked for high level. I was given a 3 bedroom on 16th floor. Views of the see and the Sail hotel Room 1602. Fantasic. Travelled with mother of 70, sister 50, son 3 years old, me 42. Bought a metro ticket pass for 1 day 16 AED, went to Dubai Mall, one stop away, as the metro is right outside the hotel. From the station there is a complimentary bus to the mall. Don't queue, just run and jump on, as everyone else did. Great mall, could spend all day there. So much for the kids, everyone really. Affordable good food, shops for every budget, very easy. Takes more than a day to get around. The Aquarium in 50AED for 3 year olds upwards. This also included the underwater zoo that is located on a upper level next to the food court. It's not made clear to you, so don't miss out. We thought it was expensive for the aquarium as we went round in around 30 mins, but when we read our receipt we realised that the zoo was included and went after lunch and that was around 45 mins to get round. My little boy loved it, it had a Nemo fish tank with all the fish from Nemo. The taxi to the Apartment is only 10-12AED, so it worth getting a taxi if there are a few of you, but we did enjoy riding the Metro, just for the experience. We didn't use the ice ring , but it looked good. You must see the indoor waterfall. We went back in the night and watch the water Fountain show, which is to Arabic music, it funs every 30 mins. The Burj Khalifah is 100 AED if you book in advance and it does get booked up so book as soon as you arrive or before hand if you can. You can go up immediately for 400 AED, but we felt that it was too expensive. You can stay up there as long as you like, once up there. There are lots of supermarkets along the main road within 5 mins walk, the open until 2am and there is one 5 mins away that is 24 hours. They are very good and stock absolutely everything from toothpaste, mouthwash to fruit, beans, crisps, tea coffee, bread , just everything and all the well know brands. The apartments are clean and tidy. Rooms are large and comfortable. The pools are warm and the gym is well equipped. We had room service once, and it was well price and good food. There is pizza hut next door, Applbey which does great food for everyone, very well prices, KFC, Burgerking within 10 mins walk. McDonald within 15 mins walk. There are great restaurants in the hotels if you don't want fast food that are also well priced. Dubai Mall is the best place to eat if everyone like different food. The food court is amazing, it has some great restaurants and not just fast food. Juicebars, oriental, italian, american, even fish and chips. Also wonderful homemade pasta place. There are eateries outside near the water fountain show which are also great. Just about everything, even fine dining. The staff are very friendly and helpful, I would definintely stay there again.

I had a 2 bedroom apartment on the 41st floor. If located somewhere good or bad really just depends on what you are looking for. It is pretty close to the Dubai Mall, which is about 5 minutes by taxi. A Metro Station is literally right in front of the building, which is convenient - you can get to anywhere along Sheik Zayed using the Metro. Mall of the Emirates is the other big mall, and the Metro Station there connects directly with the mall. Lots of food places within 10 mins walk along the street, pubs in the hotels, and with a convenient mini-mart 2 buildings down. If you plan to be doing tourist type activity and partying, then this is probably not the right area to be looking for, and you should look further down Sheik Zayed, more like in the Marina area. To get to the Marina from Chelsea by taxi will cost about 50 Dhs, so you're looking at 100 Dhs cab fare for every round trip. Madenat Souk near the Burj Al Arab will be about 60-70 Dhs round trip. It adds up to a lot if you are frequenting that side of town. The apartment was spacious, though a bit old (not very old though). They have 1, 2 and 3 bedroom apartments available, I never saw a 3 bedroom. Mine had 2-1/2 bathrooms, with the master en suite. The master has large window-walls right around (mine was a corner) which overlooked Sheik Zayed and the Burj Khalifa. At night, this was a particularly nice view. I always kept the blinds and curtains pulled back. Small TV included in the master. Larger (42\" I think) included in the living room. As I mentioned before, the age is starting to tell on a few things, such as the furniture, but it's not too bad. Big dining room table also in the apartment. The 2nd bedroom feels a bit cramped, but both bedrooms have good closet space. Bathrooms are decent enough. Since I had the apartment booked on long term, I had cleaning done 3 times a week - 2 full cleanings, and 1 half cleaning (sheets not changed unless specifically requested). Be sure to find out what exactly is included before booking in terms of cleaning schedules. For bed sheet changes, you generally have to specify that you want it done. Cleaning was good, nothing exceptional but pretty standard for a hotel. Kitchen is pretty decent, with a nice stove. Fridge is good size for a couple, washing machine and dryer included in the kitchen, along with dishwasher, microwave, and toaster. Be sure you ask about the washer and dryer, as I believe the 1 bedroom apartments have the 2-in-1 washer / dryer combo, which from what I've heard do not get the job done. Also, be sure to check for the instruction booklet of the appliances in the kitchen, otherwise you will be scratching your head. The service at Chelsea could be better. Any problems you have, when you speak with the front desk, they send someone from \"Engineering\" or \"Maintenance\" to sort it out. For simple issues, that's fine, but for bigger problems, you're facing a task. The personnel they send up are always just simple troubleshooting technicians, and no matter how much you explain the problem to the front desk or the Techs, and inform them of what you've tried already, they show up and do the same thing. After some time, my dryer simply was not functioning well. These dryers have no vent, so there is a water collection sump at the base that has to be emptied every 1 or 2 loads (note also that this is not in the manual, so look out). It turns out the dryer required a major servicing. Every time I called the front desk to tell them it was not working properly, they would sent up an \"Engineer\" who is usually an Indian or Philippino technician. He shows up, checks the water sump, and puts on the dryer. He hears it running, so then tells me it is working. After about 5 days of going through this every evening, and trying to tell him that it is running but not drying (a concept he never understood or simply did not know enough English to understand), I eventually got my secretary involved and had the matter escalated, when it finally got sorted out. There were multiple instances of similar occurrences regarding service, which was pretty frustrating at times. They offer apartments on both long term and short term stays, so the price varies a bit depending on your booking. Overall, I would say it was a good place to stay, but if you're easily frustrated with service, and / or going to be very touristy on your visit, then look elsewhere.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cGreat apartment in a central location\u201d", "Author": "OsloKrisa", "ReviewID": "UR123259151", "Content": "The Chelsea tower is a great place to stay in Dubai, as it is close to Dubai Mall and only a taxi ride away from all attractions.

The living room was large and there were two bathrooms and three WC\u00b4s in the apartment, so more than enough to accomodate most families. The apartment was clean and comfortable, especially since they clean your flat every day of your stay. There is a restaurant in the hotel, but it was mostly empty, so I would recommend walking to one of the many bars and restaurants in the close vicinity. Longs bar is very close and very cozy in a British bar sense of way. Most of the restaurants are in the adjacent hotels, but there is a variety of fast-food joints on the strip in front of the hotel. The apartment has a fully equipped kitchen, and there is a large supermarket just behind the hotel and it\u00b4s possible to order room service. The television has arabic and international channels, including movie channels in english. Be aware that you are not allowed to enjoy alcoholic drinks at the pool area, and neither smoke. In your room you may of course enjoy the drinks of your choice so I recommend stocking up on whatever you need at Dubai Airport Arrivals Duty Free, as there are no liquor stores available to tourists in Dubai.

Another advantage of the location is, if you use Etihad airlines, their office is just there as well as the special shuttle bus which takes the passengers from Dubai to the airport in Abu Dhabi so that can be very convenient. Chelsea Tower offers furnished apartments for short let (by the day but it can be longer), from one bedroom to three bedrooms.The apartments are quite large and well equiped. The two bedrooms have a good, separated and well equiped kitchen (with washing machine, real cooker...), they also have two very good and clean bathrooms, one en-suite for the master bedroom. The decor is neutral, in shade of brown and beige but pleasant. If you come by car there is a good and big car park, the valets are very very helpful with the luggages and are used to deal with enormous amounts because some clients come with big cars and big families with lot of luggages from the emirates and countries around.

The apartment itself was cleaned on a three weekly basis however, I did my own cleaning as the staffs cleaning was not up to my standard also with two young children we needed it to be clean. The beds were comfy although the rooms were a little small, we had two bathrooms with a toilet just when you came in the door which we used as store cupboard. The apartments are very noisey and if you complain nothing is done we lived there for 3 months and would say that in this time we never got one full nights sleep and were on the telephone to security most evening complaining about noise from other guests. Just to make you away the apartments are used by alot of Arab families (big families) the children run about the hotel at all hours and they are very loud. We ordered room service on several ocassions which was good but anyone will delivery to you and the delivery service is very good. There is a shop next door called Broadway which sells everything that you need and there is also a COOP just across the road which sells everything that a westener needs.

The pool was also very good and the staff were lovely and helped my twins play in the pool, however again there are alot of Arab children who do not listen to the life guards and run about and cause a disturbance for everyone else at the pool.

The view from the high up is amazing, the whole Sheikh Zayed Road is like something from a sci-fi movie... You are either facing the town /SZR or the sea, I am not sure what is more breath-taking. The facilities are very reasonable, with own swimming pool on the roof-top of an adjacent building. Not checked the gym out but it looked fine. The flat was well equipped, although we did have to ask for extra stuff like more saucepans, and we needed extra hangers - I can't fanthom how they expect a family of 4 to survive with 10 hangers between them for a month! The house-keeping was reasonably receptive and the porters super-friendly with kids. Cleaner came every day and didn't expect any tips. Generally, lower level staff were much nicer than managers and receptionists. What we didn't like: having to pay for the internet, having to pay a cash deposit at check in and the washing machine, it was a bit stinky. It also took ages to work out how to switch on the cooker, but it's probably just us! One thing to moan above - we hated the fire-alarm: it went off at 3 am one morning and we evacuated 56 flights of stairs. We were all huddled outside for nearly 2 hours, the police came and went and nobody, absolutely nobody seemed to know what's going on. After 2 hours they started giving water to kids and soon after we were allowed back into the room (around 5 am!). The children were scared there will be more arabic blasting out of the loud speakers and slept with us for what was left of the night. All together, not an experience I want to re-live again!

Upon arrival on July 1st, I was looking for a two bedroom apartment near Dubai International Financial Centre / Sheikh Zayed Road. The HR of the company I was working for provided me with a list of corporate agreements for employees in Dubai office. Chelsea was one of them and since my other friends were already staying there, the location was very good to my work and also the room we were offered was satisfactory, we accepted the offer, despite some preliminary doubts. Let me take this step by step. -Reservation Our contact person at Chelsea, Mrs. Mamta (Sales Director) was very kind to provide detailed information about the property, what it has to offer and about the 'very good offer' she can give me as a employee of a valuable company that Chelsea has been cooperating since its opening in 2005. We ended up paying 480 AED per day = 102 EUR (based on a monthly rate of 14.500 AED including internet). Despite declaring at the beginning that we would like to stay for 7 weeks, we were only offered the rate of 480 AED pr day for the first month, and thereafter a rack rate based on a shorter stay, which turned out to nearly 800 AED per day, so nearly a double of what we would have to pay for the first month. Mamta offered us to switch to a one-bedroom for the remaining time of our corporate stay in Dubai. Just to make it clear: me and my colleague from the company should share the same bedroom for 3 weeks to get the same price of 480 AED. Not only was it ridicolous by this lady that pretends to be a professional sales agent, but it was also directly offensive. Since we were running out of time and were exhausted by going from hotel to hotel in the 50 degrees C heat, we ended up booking the two bedroom apartment for one month. Once the time of the reservation was getting close to its expiry, i again asked Ms. Mamta if we can get it extended for the same rate, to which she replied that it is not possible since the hotel is having high occupancy (very doubtful since it was mid summer with temperatures hoovering 60 degrees C and a quick search on Chelsea's website showed me a wide availability, so a clear lie) and that she cannot do that. I was literally so fed up of this person that I considered finding another hotel, but since I was leaving then for a 4-5 days trip to Lebanon and Syria, I took the step of complaining to the CEO of the company I worked for and had it not been for action from my supervisor, Ms. Mamta had not approved it, but in the end, I received this very comic e-mail that it is NOW possible to offer us the same rate which previously it was not. Draw your own conclusions. I call it for very unprofessional behaviour. -Room We were assigned a two bedroom apartment on the 42nd or 43th floor (cant recall it precisely), but immediately after checking in I asked for a new room, as the air coming from the air condition in this room was very humid and it was not smelling very well. It may have most likely been due to the fact that it is July in Dubai, the warmest month of the year, and since that room was at the altidute of around 200-250 meters, with the hot wind from the desert blowing just outside the window and temperatures peaking at 60 degrees, the Air Condition may have taken the suffer of it. We were given another room (4601) on the 46th floor. The room itself had an amazing view, facing the North-Eastern side of Sheikh Zayed Rd and to the North we could see Dubai World in its full shape, an amazing view to wake up to and also to fall asleep by. Amenities in the room were as expected, the huge LCD (42'' ??) TV in the living room had some issues with its quality, not sure if the provider was to be blamed. We had two bedrooms, one master and a second one, both with their private bathrooms. The bathtube had some marks of being used for 5 years, the kitchen had all amenities one needed. Said in one sentence: the apartment had everything one could possibly need for a longer term, from pots, cutlery etc. There is however one important issue that the hotel should work on: internet connection: ridiculous that it is wired, so no wireless is offered and to get wireless we had to 'rent' a router that looked like a time machine from late 1990's, the wireless router was unsecured, thus anyone in the vicinity of our room could log in to our wireless router and eat up the bandwith of our internet connection, for which you have to pay extra by the way. We were also asked to pay extra for the router (300 AED +/- 75 EUR for one month) something we refused. The wireless was in the end not used that much, as it was insecure, very slow and the connection was breaking down very often. The IT manager, when I asked to see him, behaved like the General Manager of the hotel and were talking to me like he a man \"that orders a pizza on the phone and asking for 5 min deliver\", mean and unpolite. The issue remain unsolved. -Service After speaking to several employees of the hotel (more than 5-6) and after living at this hotel for 6-7 weeks I can say that the staff is well underpaid (paying housekeeping 200-250 USD per month in Dubai, accommodating them in a labour camp where they share the room with three other people working in Chelsea) you cannot expect full and top service from them. The concierge ltierally does not exist at this hotel, although I do remember the thin Indian boy in the lobby that always was smiling and whenever I asked him to post some letters for me, he was always very helpful. I cannot really say that the front-desk staff were efficient and they always gave me and my collegaue the look like \"you corporate customers staying with us for a long time become from time to time a 'pain in the a**' as it is commonly expressed in the USA\". The food at the restaurant was not of top quality, although the people there were friendly. I do not expect and I actually do not like fake smiles from hotel employees but when you live at the same place for so long time, it would be at least descent by the hotel staff to be a little more polite. I had several unnecessary argues with the laundy service about the costs since someone there clearly does not know how to use the calculator to count the proper cost. There were however people that were nice, the housekeeping staff (I think one was aged 20 or 22 when I asked him how old he was and the second one was a bit older 27 or 28) were always nice when we saw them, although they were cleaning the room when we were at work. The cleaning service of the room was done remarkable. -Valet Parking Living in Dubai without a car is really difficult, so I decided to rent a car for one month, a Ford Explorer. Valet parking was efficient, they never crashed the car, although at some point I was glad to have a full insurance on the car in case that would happen. One comment here that of 40 times I called the front desk and security to bring the car down from the parking house and have it ready by a certain time, in about 20 times this was never done and several times I was late for work because of this. -Pool / Gym Pool was always occupied by screaming kids, in most cases from Saudi Arabia that clearly were raised with different norms, since they disregarded other people in the pool. I tried swimming twice, but then gave it up. The gym was functionable, never full, the equipment was slightly out-dated, but then if you want to do some work out in the air conditioned environment, you dont really have an option when its 50-60 degrees outside and where you will be de-hydrated after 10-15 minutes. -Pro's - Con's Main + was the room, the view, the location. The - is high price, unpolite reservation representative (sales director - Ms. Mamta) that should learn the basics of working in the hotel business and especially since this is Dubai. Other - is relatively poor service, mistreatment of the staff (read: underpaid) The biggest minus however is a severe security breach of the hotel's front desk. While I was on a four day trip in Lebanon, I received a call from my friend that was asking me where I put the book I borrowed from him.

I'm late to put up this review. For this American in the Middle East who loves to travel to Asia I really would recommend this place for all. I actually have sent friends to see for themselves. I traveled with my husband and 12, 8 and 4 month old. It was easy to get to on Sheikh Zayed Road. We had Applebee's next door and Nando's close by. A grocery store behind us. The malls weren't too far. It was a great location. We had a car of our own but the metro was down stairs. The 2 bedroom was spacious and well kept. The housekeeping, who were men (I've only seen this in the mid east) did a good job and were nice about leaving extra towels. The kitchen had a washer/dry, dish washer, stove/oven and a full fridge. The dish were was complete and well taken care of. Toaster, Electric water kettle, microwave. We had a nice view of Sheikh Zayed which kept the kids busy watching the monorail and cars. LOL! The couch in the living room pulled out into a bed. So we had alot of space. It was quite nice. The beds were clean and crisp. Only complaints, in the bedroom the air vent faced the head of the bed which made me stuffy. The pool was a walk to get to and dh and dd didn't like that. Otherwise, a great experience for this growing family.

Apartments are based near lots of eating places within walking distance and there is also a supermarket nearby which you can walk to as well. There is a swimming pool and steam rooms, lifeguard on duty at swimming pool at all times. The pool closed at 10pm which we thought was too early really, as when you are on holiday you want to have access to the pool at all times. We found all the staff really friendly and very helpful and room service was very good as well. You can use the hotel taxis (these are more expensive) or just walk to the road and taxis are plentiful and cheap. We got taxis everywhere we went. The price for these apartments is quite steep tho.

We also requested rooms above the 4th, this request was also ignored until we decided to complain. At this point we hadn't even checked-in!! The rooms were poor, in every aspect of the word. The decor, the bed, the bathroom, the security, the TV, and even for a bunch of backpackers..this was too much!

Excellent valet parking set up if you have a car with you. Everything very new and very modern (style). Kitchen equipment a bit basic - really geared towards eating pre cooked food rather than cooking for your self. But good sized fridge and freezer. No noise issue on the 29th floor!
