I choose this hotel for many reasons - it's conveniently located in the very heart of Sultanahmet, the historic part of Istanbul, in a side lane, which makes it a very quiet and sort of secluded. It's within walking distance to most tourist attractions, resaurants, shops, bazaars. The rooms, which are cleaned every day, are comfortable, with very clean bedlinen. Wifi and access to English language TV channels allow me to keep in touch with the life outside Istanbul. The views from the room windows are stunning - Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque and the Topkapi Palace almost right at your feet, and if you go to the roof restaurant terrace, you can add the Marmara sea and the Golden Horn Bay with the famous bridge over it. It's a unique pleasure to sit in the roof restaurant watching the seaguls landing on the terrace and the sun going up between the minarets of the Blue Mosque. The breakfast they serve in the restaurant, including among numerous other things salted cottage cheese, olives, rose jam and Turkish tea is absolutely delicious! I also liked the service in the hotel: in the restaurant, at the reception and the cleaning service - they were helpful. The receptionists were helpful when approached in person or by email and by phone. It was not a problem for them, e.g. to look after my luggage for a few hours until my take off in the afternoon, which enabled me to spend a few more hours exploring the city. I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to stay in a friendly place, with great location, comfy rooms, helpful staff and good breakfast :-) I look forward to staying in Hali again!

Had a stand-up fight with male clerk on departure when I stuck to my guns and said \"It's Mastercard or nothing - take your pick\". He eventually gave in, most ungraciously.

SERVICE AND SQUALLID AND TACKY ROOMS SPOIL CENTRAL POSITION AND STUNNING VIEW\u201d", "Author": "danielFlorence_Italy", "ReviewID": "UR119599678", "Content": "my last time at the Hal\u00c4\u00b1 hotel was approximately 17 years ago after having patronised it many times since its inauguration in 1988. i came back this year following an attractive cash-payment discounted offer at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac75 per room. due to a strike in italy we arrived late at around midnight. we were \"greeted\" by an unfriendly receptionist who, with a debatable sense of humour, told us laughing that the hotel was fully booked offering us to spend an open-air overnight in the square nearby eating grass for breakfast. furthermore he tried to ask us the immediate full pre-payment of the room which we refused (he already had my credit card as guarantee so he didn't need anything else). we were exhausted after a long day and didn't appreciate his welcome. \"humour\" apart we went to our room, facing the front side with a marvellous view of the bosphorus and st.sophia. the room was at the 4th floor of a building next to the Hal\u00c4\u00b1 hotel and later connected to it with an internal passage. elevator cramped, instructions including emergency ones written in turkish only. room very modest apart the above mentioned stunning view. low ceiling, tacky decoration, holes in the wall, hasty repainting jobs, unmatching armchairs fabric, mock parquetry-style floor tiles. bathroom small but acceptable. air conditioning remote controle not working and lavabo leaking water. problems fixed on following day. where the Hal\u00c4\u00b1 hotel in my opinion dramatically lacks is in the service provided: near to none. room maids often forgot to replace towels and toilet paper at all, beds were turned up carelessly. receptionist NEVER provided us even the half of a smile, on departure we were not helped to hand the baggage to the taxi, upon leaving and re-entering the hotel we were either not greeted at all or with just a lazy grunt. the comical side of this lack of service came in the (moreover wonderful) breakfast terrace. often the door connecting our top floor with the terrace was forgotten closed so to force us to go down with the elevator cross the interconnected buildings, take the other elevator and go up from the other terrace door (quite practical, huh?!). furthermore breakfast officially begins to be available at 07.30AM but keep in mind that if you want tea or coffee you have to wait at least after 08.00 or boldly go to the kitchen and help yourself (as we did). very often either eggs, bread or butter or all of them were missing without the absolutely untrained waiters noticing it (or not caring enough). the food in itself was not bad at all, despite being a traditional turkish breakfast (cucumber, yoghurt, feta-type cheese, tomatoes, olives and so on, forget mineral water, cakes, sweets and milk) but this incredible lack of service enervated us very much. hotel decoration in common areas is oldish, uncared, dusty and charmless. a tacky hyper-coloured plaster lion welcomes people entering the main door. nonsense flashing christmas tube-lights adorn the entrance columns, a gloomy, almost always unlit and deserted bar daunts anyone wishing to have a drink. 2 free internet PCs are always switched off so to force you to waste several minutes before accessing the web. as a last commentary i would say that the only strong point of the Hal\u00c4\u00b1 hotel is its strategical position next to divan yolu, grand bazar, blue mosque and st.sophia and especially the stunning view one has from the front rooms and the top terrace, but apart that, the rest is miserably managed with an uncaring and unexperienced staff (a breakfast waitress didn't even understand the english word TEA, luckily i knew how to say it in turkish) and very unwelcoming and rude receptionists. nowadays the hotel seems to be patronised by low-class russians, turkish families with head-covered wives and a few northern europeans. i would definitely NOT recommend it unless for its position and view unless the potential customer is a backpacker or someone absolutely not minding squallid, cramped rooms and total lack of customer service. i personally do regret not having checked more thoroughly other solutions before booking this hotel.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"},

A taxi from Taksim to the hotel cost us 40 lira, but it took forever in the rush hour. Later in our stay (six nights) we took taxis back to the hotel from Istiklal Caddesi (most vibrant street in Europe?) in the early hours and only paid about 15TL.

Another good point was the bathroom with a shower that was actually separated from the rest of the room. The room size was big enough for the two of us but naturally not huge. Although they serve guests breakfast, there is no restaurant but there are plenty just minutes away. We'd go back but remember it is a budget hotel so don't expect the same level of room size and amenities as from a hotel costing two or three times as much.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver Island, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExceeded my expectations.\u201d", "Author": "IslandSojourner", "ReviewID": "UR26915359", "Content": "After reading previous positive reviews about the Hali Hotel, I thought I would give it a try since I wanted to try a location away from the intense tourist area behind the Blue Mosque/Hagia Sofia (where I have stayed previously). I emailed the Hali and asked for their best price and was pleased with their offer. I also requested a view room and was promised one. Upon arrival, my teenage son and I checked into room 206 (two single beds) and enjoyed a very nice view of the sea and Aya Sofia from the balcony. The bathroom was very nice and appears to have been recently renovated. The shower stall was large and there was plenty of hot water (except for the day my son decided to shower around noon and only had warm water)! The double-glazed windows made for peace and quiet. We stayed for 3 nights and appreciated the central location. The breakfasts were traditional Turkish fare but the view from the rooftop terrace where breakfast is served is outstanding. The only down side was that the staff were a bit on the unfriendly side - but not rude. They would be wise to sharpen up their customer service and teach the staff to smile and be a bit more personable. However, this would not deter me from staying here again. Keep in mind though that it is a 3-star hotel, so don't expect anything more than that. I would definately stay here again.", "Date": "March 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kusadasi, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cThe one I always choose...\u201d", "Author": "alisonkusadasi", "ReviewID": "UR22824594", "Content": "I have stayed at Hali Hotel 4 times simply because you can't beat the location plus it's always good to stay somewhere that you're familiar with.
