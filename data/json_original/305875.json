If you have luggage with you while coming out from the MTR station, take the lift, it's a faster and easier way than to fight with the stairs and endless escalators. The hotel is also near the ding ding electric tram terminal, which is a cheap and fun mode of transport where one gets to take great pictures of hong kong streets especially when sitting on the first seat on the upper deck. However, do note that the trams are non air-con and much slower than travelling in an MTR. The trams also do not operate till as late as the MTR. Check-in at the hotel was fast and the front desk staff kindly upgraded my parents' and grandparent's rooms to a suite with 2 bedrooms, so that it's easier for them to look after one another. However, the suite comes with only 1 common bathroom (with bathtub) and the 2 bedrooms are so small that it was nearly impossible to open the doors of wardrobe fully. The suite also comes with a small kitchenette, small dining area and sofas. My room (a normal room), on the other hand, comes in quite a comfortable size. Both the suite and my room offer harbour view, which is fantastic (for this, opt for higher floor). There is a very small and rather old swimming pool at the roof top, take the lift to the top floor and follow the signage to the swimming pool after climbing some flights of stairs. The hotel is located right in the middle of the market, which i think is a great way of experiencing the local life and there is a famous egg roll shop near the hotel (492 King's Road), opens at 9.30am and sold out by 11am! Locals can be seen queuing outside the shop from 8am+. There are many other eateries near the hotel as well, including a bakery. Convenience stall is located just a few shops down the same street. Besides, there is a 2-blindings shopping mall at Tai Koo (one MTR stop from NorthPoint). But if you are thinking of shopping at Kowloon, Newton Inn may be a little out of the way. Being located in the middle of the market, hygiene may be a cause for concern for some, the smell of market at the hotel lobby and luggage being pulled along watery streets. Cleanliness in the rooms may not be top-notched as well, given the stained carpets and bathtub. Besides, the hotel is rather aged, same goes to the furniture, fixtures and fittings in it. Other than this, i did have a good stay.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chiplun, India", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel @ USD 100 in hongkong\u201d", "Author": "opalind", "ReviewID": "UR128972848", "Content": "3*** hotel at island hongkong 50 meters from metro station. disappointed thing - swiming pool and Gym on opposite building coffe shop, money exchanger mcdonalds in next building", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cnewton inn, hongkong\u201d", "Author": "Shayne F", "ReviewID": "UR125120942", "Content": "We are a company of four and we stayed here because it is much cheaper than other decent hotels.

Accommodation is not cheap in Hong Kong so after some searching I decided on this hotel for it's price and location. When we arrived we became aware of the location of the hotel being literally in the middle of a busy market. I can guess some people would find this intimidating but it wasn't so disturbing to us. Check in was efficient and I was pleasantly suprised by the politeness of the receptionist who dealt with out group booking efficiently. We were in our rooms within 10 minutes. The rooms are fairly large and have the standard facilities you would expect. The bathrooms were good and had a bath tub and shower and were scrupiously clean. The beds are very hard (not a problem to me as that is how I like them) but I think to some,it might be an issue. There is internet by cable (HKD80 per day) which works well and I didn't mind paying for the convenience, if you want a cheaper option there are many internet cafes within 5 minutes walk. There are an abundance of cheap places to eat around the hotel and many bargains to be found in the market below. It is a meat and fish market also so sometimes is a bit pungent but really it didn't bother us at all. The location is in Hong Kong Island, about 4 or 5 minutes walk to North Point Station and is pretty accessible to everything. If you are looking for a reasonable, clean place to stay then I would happily reccomend Newton Inn, North Point.", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely not stay here again.\u201d", "Author": "Foodandphotos", "ReviewID": "UR22857528", "Content": "I am a Hong Kong native who moved to the San Francisco about 20 years ago, and recently bought a flight+hotel package to go home to visit family. This hotel (located on \"Choon Yuen\" street) presented as one of the cheapest package options, but I mistook this as the Newton Hotel which is ALSO in the same region of Hong Kong. BE AWARE: Newton Inn Hotel is NOT the same as Newton Hotel (on Electric Road); the latter, which I have visited before, is much more decent and comfortable. Our first impression of the Newton Inn Hotel was when we arrived from the airport; the limo service stopped about a block away because the street that the hotel is on is actually an outdoor \"wet market\" -- this is a very crowded street where the locals get their meats, poultry, and fish from the butcher stalls along both sides of the street. We had to wheel our luggage down a wet, filthy street stinking of fish with probably bits of guts strewn all over the pavement. This was the last thing that I wanted to do with my luggage at night after a long flight (or walk through at the end of each day to go back to my hotel). The street was also quite sketchy and poorly lit at night (but safe). The location is about 2-3 blocks from the nearest MTR subway station; the location is not inconvenient, but having to walk through that market every day got really old after a while. Our room was on the 27th floor, and was very spartan. The view was great and overlooked a big part of the Hong Kong harbor, but that was the only good thing about the room. The bed was very hard, and it felt like we were sleeping on a boxspring without any sort of padding or mattress. The sheets had stains and looked really cheap (as did the carpet), and the 2 measly towels in the bathroom were the same. Even the towels I use to wash my car has more fluff and are larger! The bathroom was very small and has very little counter space, but was otherwise adequate with good hot water. They do not provide any amenities (shampoo, etc) other than a bodywash dispenser in the shower and a bar of some Chinese no-frills soap. There is a security safe in the room, and a run-of-the-mill desk to write on. Internet is only by ethernet, and costs about $10USD per day. There is air-conditioning and climate control, and that worked okay. The lobby was filled with \"mainlanders\" from China and is a restaurant. The pool on the roof was closed during our visit, but looked nice from the photos. Overall I would say the comfort and quality of the room was a notch BELOW the Days Inn / Travelodge level in the US, and I would not give it more than 1-2 stars on a standard 5-star scale. The other hotel I mentioned, the Newton Hotel, is more like the Comfort Inn / Marriott Courtyard level of quality. Our first night was spent listening to this really loud family in the next room talking and packing from 1am to 5am; the walls are THAT thin. Every cell phone ring, zippering of bags, and conversation was heard. My hearing is not that good, but it sounded like they were inside our room. After we complained to the management, they moved us on Day 2 to another room in between two single travellers; that was much quieter and tolerable. We also took the comforter and stuffed it between the \"mattress\" and the sheets, which helped ameliorate the bed discomfort. The final part that really took the cake was on the morning of our 3rd day, when I was standing in the foyer of our room and, with a loud thud, the air conditioning duct above me came loose (totally random) and almost crashed down on me (see photo). The hotel service was very quick about coming in and repairing it, but it was just another surprise that went with the rest of our experience. Overall, I would never stay at this hotel again. I can honestly say it was one of the most uncomfortable hotels I have ever stayed in anywhere on the 6 continents, and was way subpar compared to my expectations given its price and advertisement. I felt it was a bit misleading to name itself after a nicer hotel down the street; if you are looking for another cost-effective but decent hotel in the vicinity, I would consider both the Newton Hotel and also the Metropark Causeway Bay, but stay away from this one.", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manila", "Title": "\u201cpleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "Manila_baby", "ReviewID": "UR16793271", "Content": "my over all experience with the place was pretty ok.. well i didnt really expected much since it was really affordable compared to the others but the placce was good pros.. - it was near mtr station north point - it was near the electric train station - the place is teeming with people in the morning - front desk staffs were nice. they let me changed my 1000 bill into smaller bills - room was big enough cons.. - pool was under renovation. - at night the place is pretty deserted. - no food (but there are bakeries and 7-11near it )", "Date": "June 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel for moderate price\u201d", "Author": "AustrianTraveller23", "ReviewID": "UR14005786", "Content": "I stayed together with two friends (we had one extra bed in the room) at the Newton Inn North Point for 6 nights this february.

It is in the middle of the smelly market, and at night its soaking wet (so flip flops are a no no) 2. I was woken up in the middle of the night by my partner who had just killed a cockroche (not good) 3. The housekeeping did not really 'clean' the bathroom floor was sticky and there were stains on the carpets and I found a bit of food in the corner!! (not us) 4. The staff always seemed busy and unfriendly. When I asked for a taxi to be booked to take us to the airport she said 'Depending on the circumstances I might be able to' 5. We received free toothpaste and toothbrush, and slippers and they provide body wash, however we did not receive any shampoo and also on the second night the housekeeping took away our slippers!! 6. The staff at the door did not greet you but just stood there (I think they are meant to open the doors for you when you are carrying lots of luggage) 7. They do not provide room service, however there are food places nearby 8. The walls are pretty thin, we heard people going at it at 3am til god knows what time, we turned the air con to max to block out the noise 9. You cant open the windows 10. The 'business center' for the internet use is a bit basic, the printer does not work 11. We had a little kitchen area in our room with a hob however it did not work as it did not connect to anywires! There is a space for a microwave, that would have been nice. But basically that area is a waste of space 12. The cockroache incident made me quite nervous 13. When we checked out, the staff quickly called housekeeping (i think to check to see if we had stolen anything) Felt that a bit insulting and then we were made to wait for the taxi (I was worried we would be late arriving at the airport) When I had asked several times that we needed to leave at the certain time The good things about the hotel 1. I actually found the bed quite comfortable 2. The showerhead was pretty powerful, nice showers 3. The room is fairly big, with a nice large wardrobe, desk space etc 4. The did have a fridge at least 5. It is like 5 minutes away from the MTR 6. There are shops nearby to be honest I dont know how much it cost, as our relatives paid for it, I think it was over 2000hk dollars for the first night, but I probably would not stay there, we only stayed there as my partners family stayed nearby, other than that I would chose somewhere else.", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cNice view, bad location, bad housekeeping service\u201d", "Author": "whimsical_sd", "ReviewID": "UR8752819", "Content": "I stayed a week at the Newton Inn, North Point.
