They also opened a bottle of wine for us that we had bought to drink before dinner one day. Breakfast: Pretty good for a free breakfast, especially considering this is EUROPE and not America. Assorted cured meats like salami and ham, cheese, rolls, yogurt, fruit, and espressos/lattes made to order. Very filling for a long day of sight-seeing. Room: Again, this is Europe, so the rooms are small (it is really unfortunate that a lot of negative ratings in Italian and other European hotels is because of room size). It was tight, but there was a dresser and an armoire. Fridge was also included. We wanted to sight-see, so weren't in our room much.

There are many people about to ask at the vaporetto stop if you are unsure, or ask at the ticket office. Get off at the San Marcuola stop (3rd one after piazzale roma i think!) and walk down the right hand side of the church, the hotel is on the right. you literally cant miss it! you could also walk it comfortably in 15 mins, its not hard to follow on a map.

I wouldn't wait in the long lines to buy tickets for the ferry. It's only a 10 to 15 minute walk. When you exit the railway station, go left, past the ferry docks and lines of people purchasing tickets. Walk down Rio Tera' Lista Di Spagna. You'll pass through Campo San Geremia. Keep going straight and you'll eventually come to a bridge. Go over the bridge and walk straight down Rio Tera' San Leonardo. All of these streets are lined with cute shops. As you walk down Rio Tera' San Leonardo, keep an eye out for a yellow sign that has San Marcuola on it. The sign will be on your right-hand side, up on the side of a building facing you. You'll want to follow the sign and go right. This will take you away from the crowd and down some smaller streets. Maneuver your way left and you'll eventually come to the inn. If you find the church and the San Marcuola ferry stop, the inn is right there. We really enjoyed the hotel. We had a spacious room with a balcony. The bathroom was on the small side. The only thing we didn't like about the hotel was the elevator. It was the smallest, scariest elevator I've ever been in. I think it's something you have to get used to, or do what I did....just take the stairs. The location of the hotel is fantistic. We took a ferry down to St. Mark's our first night and ended up walking everywhere else after that. We learned a very valuable lesson our first night in Venice. Don't eat in the touristy areas.....especially around St. Mark's Square. We had a horrible experience at one restaurant and were forced to pay 100 euros by the polizia for half eaten pasta dishes. The food was so bad, we couldn't finish it. We never even made it through the rest of the meal and were treated extremely rudely by the restaurant. We were so hungry, we ended up having to spend more money at another restaurant. They ruined a 60th birthday celebration. The next day, we talked to a Gondolier who gave us excellent recommendations for lunch and dinner in Cannaregio (Al Fontego Dei Pescatori and La Fonda Menta). Both places were incredible.

Considering the 140\u00e2\u201a\u00ac rate, we thought the room value was not great but maybe it was a good deal with the high rates in Venice. We observed a walk-in guest who haggled a rate of 100\u00e2\u201a\u00ac from the receptionist including a cash discount. When we inquired about the cash discount upon checkout, the staff refused to give it because we had booked through a website. The immediate neighborhood is full of restaurants, stores, and gelaterias, as well as a self-operated laundromat. We would especially recommend dinner at Osteria al Bacco on Fondamenta delle Cappuccine in the historic Jewish Ghetto. The Jewish Ghetto was very interesting with hip bars, bustling restaurants, and few tourists, only a 5 minute walk away.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Locanda Ca' San Marcuola", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d291922-Reviews-Locanda_Ca_San_Marcuola-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$132 - $264*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Cannaregio, 1763</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30121</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "291922", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/89/16/8916c6a4131872284af97ab57790bf6f1large.jpg"}}
