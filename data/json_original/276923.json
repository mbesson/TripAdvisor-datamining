The bathrooms are small and cramped but the bedroom struck me as roomier than most Paris hotels.

We visited Paris on a city break and this hotel suited us perfectly.We stayed in room 504 on the top floor, it was a nice room with a large bathoom and was nice and cosy. It had a flat screen TV but limited english channels (only BBC news), not a problem but it would be nice to have one or two more. Staff were friendly. We didnt have breakfast as here is a great bakery across the street. The hotel has limited amenities but it is perfect to use as a base for visiting the city. It is in walking distance of 2 metro stops (Los Gobelins and Place d'Italie). There are nice restaurants nearby (caesars do great pizzas), a supermarket and a lovely bakery for breakfast, theres also a macdonalds if that takes your fancy. It is a quiet area at night and there arent many bars, but the metro is great and you can be virtually anywhere in the city in minutes. I wouldnt consider it to be in he latin quarter as advertised, but you can get the metro there easily (it is a lively area near notre dame but can be quite tourisy). Very easy to get from the airport, get the roissy bus outside the terminal straight into the opera area in the city and then hop on the metro at opera metro station and your only a few stops away from les gobelins. when you exit les gobelins station, walk down the hill and turn right onto boulevard st marcel and the hotel is only is about 5 mins walk away just past the carrefour.

We were there on 3 separate occasions during our European holiday, just how it worked out (3 nts, 6 nts and 3 nts). I reckon we got to know it pretty well and they got to know us. Francois, the manager is the Ace, he is very good, very efficient, very helpful, he understands Australians, he visits most years. Yes our room was small and yes the bathroom/toilet was small but it was OK for us, we weren't there all that much. It made us feel as though we were in Paris. Our room looked over Boulevard Saint Marcel, with the opening window providing us with a very nice view of the sun setting next to the Eiffel Tower each night. Boulevard Saint Marcel is not an unpleasant street., The sight of over a thousand roller bladers going past the hotel one Friday evening blowing whistles was a nice surprise. We are easily excited. The breakfast room is very small, let's say cosy but it was fine for us, we are only little things. It was not a lavish breakfast but plenty for us (cereal and yoghart, toast and croissants, scrambled eggs, little sausage thingos, muffins and pastries and cheese and fruit). Don't be mistaken, we can \"put it away\". With regard to visiting the sites of Paris, we in almost all cases walked, it is no problem for us two seniors but it may not suit everybody. We took different routes, it was interesting walking through places like the markets of Rue Mouffetard. Metro stations are not far away and so is the bus but we made little use of either. We did however, walk up to Austerliztz or whatever (there are two together I think) to travel to Versailles and Gard de Lyons was a very short cab ride away when we used the Eurorail to travel to Milan. Francois stored some luggage for us. Gard de Nord is further away, but it turned out to be a very manageable cab ride when we got the Eurostar to London. The front desk was very helpful with transport and other matters. We used the nearby bus service to travel to Sacre Coeur. As others have advised the lift is very small but it does the job. A bakery is virtually right across the road and a small and a much larger supermarket are very nearby, we used them. A few restaurants are nearby, we enjoyed the place across the road and down a bit to the right towards Gard de Lyons. We liked their pizzas. Jardin des Plantes is a moderate walk and the Luxemburg Gardens was a mile or more away, I suppose. We had a good time at the Hotel La Demeure but we're just simple people from \"Downunder\". There were a lot of Australians and NZs staying at the hotel.

From the photos the rooms looked beautifully decorated and relatively spacious (for Paris anyway). When we got to our room we did love the way it was decorated (the room looked simple and elegant), but it was TINY. There wasn't much room to walk around the bed and there was almost no room for our suitcases. We ended up just shoving our suitcases under the desk or in the closet to ensure that we wouldn't trip over them when we were walking to the bathroom. Another thing we didn't expect was that this room only had one bed. We had asked for two twin beds rather than one queen bed, but it seems they were out of rooms with twin beds so we had to settle for what they had left. It wasn't a huge deal, but having two beds might have been nicer. That said, the bed was pretty soft and comfortable (despite the fact that some of the pillows were a little lumpy). We had also expected a pretty nice shower based on other reviews that we read and while the shower was more deluxe than most hotel showers I didn't really care for it. The shower had about five different nozzles spraying on me and all of them sprayed pretty hard. It didn't bother me as much that the one spraying my head was intense, but for the ones spraying my chest and stomach I thought it kind of hurt. However, you can turn the extra nozzles off so it isn't a huge problem. One pleasant surprise about the hotel room is that we had a little balcony with a small table and chairs and from it we could see the top of the Eiffel tower! It was very French and beautiful and it was so fun to come home at night after a day of exploring the city and surrounding areas and watch the Eiffel tower sparkle. It made me feel as though the money I spent on the hotel was well worth it! Now, onto other aspects of the hotel. The day staff was very friendly and helpful, but the night staff was less so. Additionally, we were told that the hotel had complimentary wifi, but it didn't. We had to pay one euro per day for unlimited wifi, which isn't bad at all, it just would have been nice to know about it in advance. Lastly, the elevator is probably the smallest one I have ever been inside in my entire life. I would say that only two people can fit in the elevator comfortably and if it's two people with suitcases you might have to take turns. The neighborhood the hotel was in was very pleasant! I really loved it. The hotel was close to two metro stops and was near a few grocery stores and a lot of restaurants and patisseries. My friend and I, two very petite girls, felt very comfortable walking around alone even at night! Across the street from the hotel and down to the left a little bit is a nice creperie that I would recommend to guests staying at the hotel. Their dinner crepes aren't the best in the world, but they're not bad, and their dessert crepes are as good as any. The owner of the creperie is the sweetest man in the world! He hardly knows any English, but is extremely patient with English speaking tourists as they butcher their way through French pronunciations. The owner is originally from Greece so if you're nice to him he might even give you some free ouzo! :)", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oakville, Canada", "Title": "\u201cfabulous\u201d", "Author": "infrequenttraveller5", "ReviewID": "UR114732136", "Content": "OK, I was VERY nervous about our making accommodations in Paris - first, what part of Paris to stay in, next finding a hotel.

Room size was not very large but I prefered this as the ambience felt much more Parisian, romantic and cosy. The room was very well heated which was a necessity as Paris itself was absolutely freezing when we visited. Decor was pleasant enough and our room also came with a TV and ipod docking station. The bathroom, although small aswell, was very clean and warm with a brilliant shower. Towels and bedding were changed daily. The reception is very warm and welcoming, as were all the members of staff we spoke to. The hotel does offer a breakfast service but we never sampled this as the hotel is opposite a fabulous Boulangerie selling delicious pastries from morning til evening. The location of the hotel was also fabulous; on a main street with many cafes for daytime and restaurants for the evening, most of which were very reasonable and attracted a good mix of locals and tourists. This was a massive plus for us as we found that because we weren't near an attraction or the centre that the quality of food and value for money was much better and the general area did not feel at all 'touristy', giving you a much better experience of the Parisian atmosphere. The hotel is also situated in between two metro stations and about 20mins walk away from the nearest RER station and l'Open tour orange line bustop, so is brilliant for getting around the city and fairly easy to reach from the airport. The hotel is also very near to the Jardin des Plantes, which is well worth a visit for the musuems that surround it. You can also catch the blue tour route from here. The only negative I could give for this hotel would be that it was sometimes a little noisy at night. The doors are a bit difficult to open/close and so have a tendency to bang which can be a problem with guests returning late or leaving early. There is also a general murmering coming from the main road throughout the night. However, this was a very small negative and we were normally far too tired to care after walking around Paris all day.

The rooms are clean, staff are friendly, and same staff have been there for some time so we feel we can rely on them to take care of things while we are visiting. The interiors are chic, neat, and sylish but not too much -- it is not ostentatious. One can tell that the quality level of care that the owners have for the rooms is very high -- the shower, bath were new and very nice; very high tech, looking as if they had be recently renovated. When we wanted a bath for my Japanese mother in law, the management was very accommodating and arranged one for us\u2026 Again, we found the rooms to be very clean, very nice. Amenities like shampoo and soap were excellent [I still miss the soap that was provided for the room... if I could, I would even buy that for my shower at home] as well as the robes, which I enjoyed very much, using mine every night. One can tell the owners are taking good care of this building and it's facilities... Not all hotels of this grade and that are in this kind of older building are this well looked-after. Breakfast was good, and we especially noted that the bread, coffee and ham were simple but good quality & most importantly: fresh. Choices at breakfast were limited but this is not unusual in Paris, and La Demeure's breakfast was something we were happy to start our day with. Some of the rooms facing the front have a view of the Eiffel tower, and this is particularly nice in the evenings when we returned from dinner and were enjoying some wine in our rooms. The view was quite nice. We want to come back because it really does feel like one is living in Paris. We've stayed at the hotel over 6 times, and are planning to return this April. We love the neighborhood and every time we visit, we really feel like we are actually part of a 'real' community... not just staying in some tourist area that has no personality or interest.

Parisian hotel rooms are well known to be cramped by American Standards, although the room we received was not as bad as others I have seen. There was a notable absence of dressers and little room to store luggage. The bathroom was a little roomier, and the facilities were modern and quite nice, however there was a European shower in a bathtub with no shower curtain. The room was very quiet, although you will hear street traffic if you open the windows. I can say that compared to other hotels I really did not hear the other patrons moving around at all. The lobby was small but elegant, with a nice sitting area where you can cruise the free Wifi and order cocktails. There is electronic music playing from a stereo over their fireplace which was appreciated in my case, but I could see how this might be a negative to older travelers. The staff was very friendly and helpful - they helped us find a local electronic store to buy a needed European adapter and hair dryer. There is 24 hour desk service. The elevator is small and cramped and frequently in use by other patrons, and the stair case is somewhat steep, so with older travelers you may want to request a room on the 1st Etage. We were on the 4th floor and mostly used the stairs. The free wifi was readily available, but somewhat difficult to get in our room. One great negative that you should be aware of is the breakfast. The breakfast is $13 Euros a day extra, although there is an option to book with breakfast which I saw on Expedia when I was booking the room and then promptly forgot about. It's a rather standard breakfast with Coffee, Tea, bread, Croissant, Cheese, Ham, Cereal. Honestly, you could do a lot better in the charming surrounding neighborhood. There is an excellent Boulangerie across the street and half a block down, and a great cafe a few blocks away near the subway called Cafe Goblins. They fail to mention this extra charge at check-in, and just mention the location and hours of breakfast, which I felt was somewhat subversive on their part. The location is definitely one of the strong points of this hotel. It's located in the 13th Arrondissment, in a lovely French working neighborhood. There are many cafes and small shops, but not much tourist traffic. The Seine is close by, as is the Jardin des Plants. As a runner, I found it very convenient for running along the Seine. It is within walking distance to Saint Germaine des Pres and the Bastille, as well as the very lovely area around the Sarbonne.

Unfortunately this was not the case and our experience at this hotel was so disappointing, it has prompted me to write a review. I don't want to insinuate that other reviews were incorrect, but I do believe people should be aware of 3 issues, which could easily be avoided, but unfortunately for us, ruined our experience at Hotel La Demeure Firstly, our room (Room 30) was fair from satisfactory for the price. It so small we could barely fit both suitcases on the floor. It was incredibly dark and was lit by 3 lamps. There were no duvets - only one woolen scratchy blanket. On one side of the room was the toilet. You then had to cross to another side of the room for the shower and hand-basin - unpleasant! It was so awful we tried to upgrade but unfortunately there were no other rooms available. If you want functional, then this room is fine as you certainly won't be compelled to spend any time beyond sleeping in there. Secondly, be aware that breakfast is charged AND it's expensive. When I booked our accommodation, I booked a 'package' deal with the assumption that breakfast was included. Upon checking the website, there was no mention of the breakfast being charged over and above our 'deal', nor was there any sign on our confirmation print-out, in the bedroom, the lobby or the dining room itself. In fact, upon checking in, the attendant eagerly told us the breakfast times and that if we didn't want to come downstairs, it would be brought up to us. This would not have been a problem except that each day we went down at 9.30am (the dining room shut at 10am) and each morning my partner had muesli and I had only a coffee as there were no croissants left. One particular morning I asked if there were more available and was gruffly told 'no'. Upon checking out, we were informed that we were being charged \u00a313 per person per breakfast. Outrageous!! I explained that firstly, my understanding was the breakfast was included in our deal and secondly, there was no food available when we went to eat. The manager was incredibly rude and insisted that we pay \u00a313 - despite having had only a coffee! He also insisted that our print-out stated that breakfast was not included - which it did not. Lastly, while we found the 2 young men on the front desk absolutely lovely (!!), we found the manger (who dealt with us while checking out) incredibly incredibly rude. As well as accusing me of lying, he then threw my partners bag into a cupboard - quite literally. All in all, it was an incredibly disappointing experience and almost ruined our relaxing weekend away. I'd suggest staying in the backpackers literally just around the corner (Hostel Oops - very new, lovely people and half the price - I really wish we'd stayed there!). If you do decide to stay at Hotel La Demure, perhaps request a room over-looking the street (from what we could tell, they seemed to be lighter) and instead of having breakfast in, venture up the street to the lovely markets (or just get a coffee or croissant from across the road for a tenth of the price) :o)", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Fantastic Staff\u201d", "Author": "Beccaniece", "ReviewID": "UR31283648", "Content": "My sisters I and went on a long weekend trip to explore Paris.

Hotel rooms in Paris tend to be fairly small, and this hotel was no exception. The size, however, was adequate.

I also remember commenting on the Manager's collection of beautiful teapots & other ornaments in the hotel which reflected on the tasteful decor of the hotel.

A cafe worth going to eat at, as highly recommended by Fx Cauet, is Le Pot O'Lait creperie located not far from the hotel. We had dinner there two nights in a row & had the best crepes (savoury as well as sweet) & the manageress (Marie) was very hospitable. Another great place to eat is Le Canon Les Goblins near the hotel. The meals there were inexpensive & well presented. The Louvre is worth a visit but do buy your entry tickets at the metro kiosk near the Louvre to save being in the queue when you are actually there. Champs Elysses is a definite to check out for great coffees, crepes & shopping! The Latin Quarter located a couple of metro stops from the hotel is worth going to as it is interesting - many eateries/cafes etc. There are also the Paris markets where you can get lovely souvenirs, gifts and antiques & dont forget to pay a visit to opulent Gallerie La Fayette for some jaw dropping window shopping! The only drawback we had at the hotel was on our last evening & the next morning when there was no hot water as the hotel's hot water system had apparently broken down & it was the weekend. We had to opt for cold showers which was unpleasant esp for my son as he had succumbed to the flu then.

The rooms were clean, contemporary and quiet. The bed was very comfortable which can be a rarity when traveling. The hotel was close to two metro stops and several good restaurants.
