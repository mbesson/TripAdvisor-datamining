The following day they said they still didn't have any - but I insisted and amazingly they found me one. Room was ok, but just ok, sparse furnishings - bathroom was 10 years old and showed - shower poor. Food can best be described as average (although one of our party got food poisoning) - if you like salad you will be fine - but the meats were 'challenging'. Orange juice from sachets is not good. They have security on the main entrance - complete with metal detector - this is to detect you trying to bring your own food and drink in (their prices are at the rip-off end of the spectrum). Staff ranged from helpful in one or two cases to plain indifferent. Odd situation when they close down the bars...especially on the pier!", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiev, Ukraine", "Title": "\u201cbad example of 5* hotel\u201d", "Author": "nshnsh2007", "ReviewID": "UR115237101", "Content": "Only a few people from staff speak English. Food was poor, can be acceptable but not for 5* hotel. Separate subject is coffee, which is only Nescafe is available with instant coffee cream. Beach is completely terrible and dirty. Sewage from hotel and other houses was poured out straight to the sea. I have doubt about cleanness of pool. In conclusion, this hotel is far away from 5*hotel", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cComplimentary hotel by Turkish Airlines\u201d", "Author": "x5marano", "ReviewID": "UR90272886", "Content": "I was flying with one of my friends to Tokyo from Rome and we had a stop in Istanbul. Cause our flight was delayed one day later, Turkish Airlines offered us this hotel. It is a 5* hotel near the sea. The surrounding weren't really great but the hotel was absolutely nice. The rooms are big and clean, bathroom the same with a fantastic shower! I can suggest it only if you are travelling and you need to rest, It is not a base to visit Istanbul, it is too far from the city centre!", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "izmir", "Title": "\u201csmiling faces, best hospitality!\u201d", "Author": "tiyoucha", "ReviewID": "UR85998228", "Content": "I went there with my uncle, his wife, my little cousin, my mother and my sister for a little holiday. I have to specify that food&beverage department is amazing! I have eaten the most delicious food ever! Spa works very well and the foam massage in the Turkish bath is the best way to relax... Swimming pools are great because the water is refined sea water; that makes the pools healthy with less chemicals in te water. I hate the pools because of the smell of pool water but there is no chemicals smell in the pools in Artemis Marin Princess. Rooms are comfortable and room service works well. My sister loves green plum and they brought us green plum everyday :) :) Congratulations to the managers and their staff for sending all of their guests smiling from that beautiful place :)", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Artemis Marin Princess Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1912072-Reviews-Artemis_Marin_Princess_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$118 - $158*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kamiloba Mah.
