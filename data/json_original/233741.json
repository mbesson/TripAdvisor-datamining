The reception staff were excellent throughout our stay, being consistently friendly and helpful and providing some valuable guidance as to local places to eat and drink (Oh! Duo being particularly excellent). The hotel is situated on a relatively (for Paris) quiet street, right outside the Javel Andre Citroen Metro station and a is couple of minutes walk from the Javel RER station, which can take you to the Eiffel Tower in five minutes (although it's only twenty minutes to walk) and Notre Damme in ten. Despite being part of a large hotel chain, the Plaza Pont Mirabeau is quite a small hotel and has quite a lot of the sort of small hotel charm that is often lacking in the larger hotels that you often find in big cities like Paris. We had a first floor room and, as has been commented on by other reviewers, we could hear the Metro trains when they passed, but the sound was not loud enough to be disturbing or intrusive and did not disturb our sleep at all. However, it may be something you wish to consider if you are a particularly light sleeper. Apart from that, our room was comfortable, clean and well presented. When we were checked in, we were told that we could move to another room if the one we'd been given was not to our satisfaction in any way. The hotel has a small restaurant area where they serve an excellent buffet breakfast each morning.

As there were none available we decided to take a room on the 1st floor but due to the metro noise we requested to be moved and the staff were very accommodating. Our room was lovely and very big in comparison to the first one they gave us, the bed was extremely comfortable and there were tea and coffee facilities (although there is no English breakfast tea so I would suggest taking some with you). Breakfast is slightly expensive but they had a good selection to choose from. Although the location of the hotel is only a 15 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower it is still quite far from Central Paris; on the plus side there is a very convenient metro and train station right opposite the hotel. There are also a number of restaurants along the street and a variety of cuisines to choose from including Thai, Indian, Lebanese and French. There is also a Supermarket and a Post Office down the road which has a cash point. All in all the service, hotel and location were terrific and suited our needs for the 2 nights we were there. The only downside is that there were no English television channels apart from BBC News and some of the rooms are very very small so my advice would be to ask for a more spacious room on arrival.

We were moved to 301, a few floors directly under where we had been originally. Same sized room due to the layout of the building. This room had patio doors but sadly no balcony and only a view of trees and the street. So if you want a Seine view you need to be on the front on a high floor. This room was nice but some finishing touches seem to have gone awol, ie the throw from the bed etc which if we hadnt have been in another room we probably wouldnt have noticed. Beds are comfy, my other half even said its one of the best beds he's slept in?? During our short stay we found the reception staff to be ok, one girl in particular was very friendly and helpful but others didnt even acknowledge you as you came and went. Housekeeping could do with a kick up the bum, one day we came came back to the room to find no tea, coffee etc, and an empty toilet roll hadnt been replensished, the cardboard tube was still on the holder. The hotel don't (or didnt whilst we were there) provide english/breakfast tea in the rooms, only herbal and fruit. So if you like a tea in the morning, take some just in case. Coffee was provided in the room. One other thing to bear in mind is that whilst the very nearby metro station is handy, it must run under the hotel or under somewhere close because when we were in the lower floor room we could feel and hear it. So if you are a light sleeper take some earplugs or make sure you get a high floor. All in all, the hotel is in a good location, even if at first you might think it isnt and it is comfortable enough for a few nights. We would definately consider staying there again on our next trip to Paris.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMixed Emotions\u201d", "Author": "mrrick200 Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR118895502", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel to a very helpful, friendly receptionist who even though we were early, like 08:30 am, had a room prepared while we had breakfast. The rooms are small (as most in Paris I understand) but clean and with a small balcony and a view of the Seine river. The same receptionist was a pleasure, advising us on tours, things to see and booking us a dinner cruise which was very nice. My wife and I were visiting Paris for sightseeing mainly while I was on my way to work in Angola, Africa for one month. We purchased food for our consumption, but also things like noodle soup and cereal for me to take to work offshore. The problem was, I believe when the maid mentioned all the food we had in our room, and assumed we were there to \"camp out\" in the room and eat. This was far from the truth, as we ate out every meal except for the hotel breakfasts, which were extra money but worth the 15 euros each. They removed the water container part of our coffee machine so we could not make soup with the water saying the machine was broken, although it worked fine. This was unfortunate as I had purchased my own brand of coffee that I prefer, even though theirs was free. I would have appreciated the manager speaking to us but that was not the case so carried on and enjoyed our time in Paris. The main problem was the second receptionist. She tried to overcharge us for 2 breakfasts, and commented that we had not spent much money in the hotel for staying 4 nights. That was true as we had paid for 2 days full breakfasts with the booking. The hotel does not serve lunch and diner...plus why would she care or even comment about this issue. When I was paying the bill to check out, I informed her that we had also booked a 1/2 day trip to the country, through the hotel, and paid 10 euros for the booking. When we arrived to take the tour, they had sold our seats and the tour was full. I requested the 10 euros be refunded, and she stated it was not \"her\" fault and she would not refund the money. We were flabergausted. The Mercure hotel is a fine chain, and I stayed at the Mercure near the Paris Airport almost every month for 5 years because of it's quality and service. It is unfortunate that a couple misguided workers can change the stay of a couple only wishing to enjoy a holiday.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cvery good hotel\u201d", "Author": "prashar18", "ReviewID": "UR118783141", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for three nights with my wife.

It was our first time ever in Paris and we needed to have a great time after all the planning and the stress involved with flying overseas to what we consider the most visited country in the world. This hotel made our stay as lovely as it could have been. It started out a little rocky. I booked our room literally 25 minutes before we showed up to check in after our original hotel fell through. I found a killer deal on Easy Click travel with the breakfast buffet included at no cost. We showed up and met Luca, one of the managers, and our confirmation flashed across his screen within a minute of us walking in the front door. While the reservation was good, a room that could accommodate two people was not available. Luca told us that if we sandwiched into a single for the night he would give us a double PRIVILEGE room for the remainder of our stay. I did not have much of a choice because it was already 9:00 p.m. and I was not about to scour the streets of a town I had never been to before in the hopes of maybe finding a hotel to take us on the fly. So I put my faith in Luca...and I am glad I did. The next afternoon, we moved into room 402 which was a very nice room with a tub and coffee maker, and with a decent view out the window. You should know that this Hotel is very modern, it only opened in Feb. of 2011. The shower and tub is very comfortable. The air conditioning made it as cold as we wanted but on several nights we slept with the windows open because there was a nice breeze, little to no street noise and some lovely flowers boxes on the guard rail. The room was cleaned each time we got back and the fridge came in very handy when we wanted to store some food or cool some beers. There is free internet on the computer in the lobby. We used it to research the Paris pass which is a phenomenal value if you plan on going to some of the museums and attractions in the city. We bought a two day pass for 35 euros a person and we made the money back within the first six hours of using it. Breakfast is the only time that we got frustrated at the Mercure. It ends at 10 a.m. but if you show up at 9:45 a.m. don't expect much. I am an American and there are plenty of rude Americans but some of the things I witnessed at the breakfast bar by some of the Europeans were pretty unspeakable. At one point, I saw a German man threaten to call his lawyer because he did not make it down in time to get some food. He was intent on suing because he could not get a bowl of granola with milk or a couple of breakfast sausages! A Spanish woman removed a hot tray from the chaffing dish and then dumped the remainder of the food onto her plate, while people were waiting in line behind her! You would think she could have left one or two morsels for others but no such luck. I later saw a French woman create a tower of rolls and croissants on her dish that stood at least 10 inches tall. It would take me five days to eat that much bread and pastry but she felt that she had to have them all. These are all savage moves and no one culture should be looked down on for these sophomoric tactics. But I just wish to warn you: the breakfast buffet turns into the school cafeteria just as it is about to run out of food. Your best bet is to get there at 9 and beat the rush and the headaches associated with watching people greedily horde food. Now onto the neighborhood, for being so close to the Eiffel Tower (20 minute walk), it actually feels like a real French neighborhood. There are great, low key restaurants nearby that don't have menus in English but will try and translate as best as possible. There is a pharmacy across the street. This came in very handy when I developed a severe head cold on my second day. There was a lovely young lady inside who helped me select a cold medicine. She spoke great English which really saved the remainder of my vacation. There is also a kebab hut and small produce market next to that if you feel like getting some snacks. The bus that took us to ORLY airport for the next leg of our trip stoped right in front of the hotel entrance. And the metro and suburb train is across the street, literally spitting distance. This comes in very handy when you want to visit the main attractions in the city or go out to Versailles to see Louie's famous palace. Aside from the wonderful location and amenities, the people working at the Mercure are very nice. I had the chance to speak with Vincent, the head manager, Kevin, and Luca on multiple occasions. Each of them, along with the petite Asian lady were all sincerely interested in making our stay as nice as possible. This is a hidden gem of a hotel and I am glad we were able to stay there when we did. Because it is a relatively young property, there is an emphasis to leave this positive and lasting impression on each guest that comes in the door. Older hotels could really care less. But the people we came into contact with are passionate about what they do and it is quite refreshing to see that kind of commitment, particularly in the hotel/hospitality industry, where horror stories are a dime a dozen. Do yourself a favor and book a room there if you want to have a great Paris experience.

You could barely walk around the bed which almost filled the whole room. I went to reception to ask if it was really a double room and we got moved to room 105 which was bigger ( with a bigger bed) but still a little odd. It had very little natural light (one window faced a walled courtyard and another was a small window high up) and although the shower room and toilet were separate which was great, the shower room didn't have a door, just a curtain. That said, both rooms were clean and modern. The location of the hotel is great for the Eiffel tower which is only 20 mins walk away along the river and there is a metro stop right outside. If you want to be in the heart of it with lots of bars, cafes and restaurants around you then this hotel probably isn't for you.
