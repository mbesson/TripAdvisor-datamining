We drove from Los Angeles stopping enroute at La Holla briefly before proceeding to Point Loma. I booked the above hotel after reading guest reviews and the proximity to the Cabrillo Monument. The hotel was easy to find been on the main Rosecrans Street, with fre underground parking, albeit a bit cramped There was lift to access the rooms. The room we had was adequate, clean and tidy although a bit dated and tired. There was a functioning AC The bathroom was well maintained and the towels were clean and fresh. The neighbourhood had plenty of eating places catering to variety of cuisines. We tried a Thai restaurant-Thai House and was very impressed with the service and quality of the delicious food. The in-house complimentary breakfast was a joke-it was almost non-existent consisting of very weak coffee and some limp, listless apology of a strudel. The owner sensing our disappointment did recommend a bakery next door which served excellent breakfast. We visited Point Loma which was 4 miles drive from the hotel. The marina was walking distance. We would stay here again as it is value for money for an overnight stay but would skip the breakfast!", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cA Hidden Gem in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "John L", "ReviewID": "UR118761017", "Content": "I just spent 5 weeks in this small hotel, ideally located in San Diego. Originally I checked-in for 3 days but the High Level of Service from Dan the owner, won me over and I cancelled my other reservation to spend my entire stay at Cabrillo Inn. It is a comfy \"unpretentious\" small hotel run by a family who understand Customer Service and what it lacks in amenities from larger hotels is more than made up by good service and convenience. There is Off Street parking and a magnificent view of the San Diego skyline from the 4th floor landing. Nearby Starbucks and small eateries are all nearby.

Very dingy front lobby area, and our room was pretty run down. There was a tile loose in the bathroom, the furnishings all outdated and shabby. Lots of traffic noise from the street, too. Breakfast is non existent - a coffee urn and some dried out pastry. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable. However, we stayed at the Best Western Lamplighter on the way home, and for only an extra $10 - and there were 4 of us, not 2! - we had a much nicer room, very modern, and a super breakfast.

This time we needed a place that was pet friendly so we thought we would try the Cabrillo. The hotel is an odd building from an architectural perspective. The basement is the indoor parking area. The office is on the first floor but there are no rooms there. The second floor is numbered as the third and the third floor is numbered as the fourth floor. The rooms all face toward the inside of the hotel which is actually hollow with a void that opens to the sky on the two floors with rooms. The rooms on the south side of the hotel have views out onto south Point Loma whereas the rooms on the north side have views of the void.The front of the building opens out onto busy Rosecrans St. with a bit of a view of the harbour. This is the smoking area but also makes a sort of private deck, nice if its sunny and warm. The continental breakfast is a bit skimpy, coffee and strudel. Fortunately, this area of Point Loma is very visitor friendly and if you so desire all sorts of cuisine is within easy walking distance, as are banks, laundromat, general store, pharmacy, post office, liquor stores etc. Our room was on the south side on the fourth floor and was therefore a bit noisy with the sliding door open, but my wife's snoring largely drowned it out. Our room was a bit crowded as there was an extra single bed in there that we didn't need, however the fridge and microwave worked fine. The TV was a bit small but compensated by having a good selection of channels and the wifi also worked well. We originally booked for 3 nights and even took an extra night and in hindsight we should have stayed 5 nights or even longer. Overall, we found the Cabrillo to be good value, it's well located, clean and cozy.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cReally pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "Planehazza", "ReviewID": "UR97030484", "Content": "I stayed for one night after flying from the UK to San Diego.

You had to keep the door (to the non-existent balcony) open in order for it not to generate more heat than cold (it wasn't vented, so this was the only way to vent it).
