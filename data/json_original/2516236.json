Yes, it's cheap but it's also kind of sad in a way. It's a property with so much potential if they put some effort and some $$ into it. It looks like Stalag 13 as you're driving by on the highway. We arrived to front desk staff person that really didn't seem to want to be at work that day. She gave us a room on the left side of the property, even though we were one of few people staying there. We arrived to an overpowering smell of bleach in the room upon arrival. The door was open, perhaps to air it out and you could smell the bleach before you even got in the room. I can see why they used so much bleach. There was mold in the shower. It took forever to get hot water in the bathroom sink. The windows in the bathroom were filthy and the screen even worse. (See photo) Despite the dirt/mold in the bathroom, the rest of the room was clean, so I rated it average. One thing I've learned from my travels and especially my line of work is that photos often make a property look much better than it appears in \"real life\". Some of the photos you see here on Trip Advisor give the impression that it's a very nice place, where the reality is that i wasn't sure whether our room had been refurbished or not. I don't think so. Pros: microwave and fridge in the room, less expensive than other places in the area, basic continental breakfast in the am, pool (we didn't use as it was too cool - December visit) Cons: tired facility, like walking back into the 1950/60's with shower stalls and bathrooms that are really run down and showing their age, dirty screens, apathetic staff (on our visit), hair dryer not working Would I stay here again?

When I discussed it with the Manager she stated there was nothing she could do about it. I explained that I was being punished for booking in advance from their site. She said I wasn't being punished and said it was just like booking through a discount website. I said I didn't see the similarities between booking through the discount sites and the hotel site. She said that was the \u201cNapa way\u201d. If that is truly the Napa way, I\u2019ll just have to frequent another region of California that has a large wine crop. Then she mentioned if I had called in my reservation she might have been able to help. I inquired how that would be different with the intention of providing that information here, so no one else would have to be punished for using their website and booking in advance. She said well I don't know. Then she asked why I hadn't brought it to their attention the night before and I stated I did not know he had gotten a better rate. I would have thought with so many vacancies they would have extended the special rate to customers who booked directly through them \u2013 whether online, over the phone or in person. And I hadn't even thought to ask my friend what he had paid. She still would not adjust my account. In this economy they made the choice to turn away any future business by not adjusting the rates they assigned to me. The room was disgusting. The floor has some thing on it next to the bed. It was crusty and when I walked over it with clean feet that I had recently put lotion on, it turned my foot the color of the carpet. The shower had a lot of black mold in the grout and the drain. The drain was almost completely covered in hair as well. The bathroom window was broken. It opened to the apartment complex next door, with hardly a fence. The bathroom didn't have a fan either, which made showering extra fun! The best part was, when I checked out I discussed it with the Manager. She stated that the room was clean. When I took her to the room I stayed in to show her what I considered dirty she stated she still believed it was clean. Looked at the black mold and said the shower was fine. Felt the carpet with her foot and said there was nothing on the carpet.

The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful with dining recommendations. The room was a motel style room - nothing too exciting. We were told that the rooms had been rennovated about 15 years ago and they were starting to do another round of rennovations. It's about a 20 minute walk through a residental neighborhood to downtown where there are lots of shops & restaurants.

Supposedly, according to WVL, this fee is taxes that were not included in our initial online fee. Have purchased many, many rooms online and have never had extra tax fee applied. Wonder if they are omitting the taxes to make it appear the room is a better deal???? Still researching. WVL is in older section of Napa, next to some sort of river construction area, not at all scenic. Breakfast barely exists. WVL needs a major facelift in order to just stay afloat in Napa.

This is a nice, clean motel located just minutes from Downtown Napa. The rates are very reasonable for the area, although if your main objective for visiting Napa Valley is wine tasting, you'll find Wine Valley Lodge a bit far from where most wineries are located (15-30 min. drive). The room is comfortable and clean. The bathroom is clean, but lacks a bathtub (shower only). The water pressure is low, and the water temperature fluctuates quite a bit. It is evident this motel was built in the 50's, and hasn't been renovated for a while. The building, furniture, and decor of the rooms are all very dated. You won't find internet hookup here, and if you need a hair dryer or iron, be prepared to make a trip to the front desk, as they're not available in the guest rooms.
