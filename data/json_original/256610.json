Make sure you get the city view room to enjoy a stunning view over Darling Harbour and the city skyline. Much nicer view than CBD hotels, and a lovely, short walk to the CBD anyway. We spent a lovely 3 days walking all over the city, to Circular Quay, Botanical Gardens, QVB, restaurants (loved 360, very special). The Novotel Darling Harbour was a great, reasonably priced break (especially if you're a member of Accor Advantage club, as we are). On previous visits, the food has been lovely, but this time it wasn't the usual standard, unfortunately. We both ordered beef fillet, which was cooked just as we ordered, and a lovely cut of beef, but came with no sauce/jus and just steamed vegetables. And that was that. Extremely bland. We asked the waitress if sauce would be possible and she found some luke warm 'garlic sauce' which was ok, better than nothing. We ordered ginger puddings, which turned out to be microwaved cakes, again no sauce! Completely dry, in fact. Just ice cream on the side. Quite disappointing, didn't eat mine. Breakfast is usually great here, with a gorgeous view too. The second morning, however, was pretty busy and the poor chef was all by himself and seemed really stressed (was no wonder, he was trying to keep everything stocked while cooking short orders too). Needless to say there were many build-ups of people waiting for sausages/eggs/mushrooms/tomatoes that had been depleted. When I got there everything was empty. I really felt sorry for him. Overall though, a great choice for a Sydney getaway, but best when special occasions (eg Easter) don't bring the set menus and crowds.

I recommend if you get a cheap rate and if they replace the mattresses.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreeted with a Smile\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR124998141", "Content": "On arrival to hotel I was greeted with a smile from the Front desk staff.

That said, it has a wonderful outlook over Darling Harbour and across the Sydney CBD. Provided you are not expecting to look out your window and see the Bridge - you won't be disappointed with this hotel. We booked interconnecting rooms overlooking the Harbour for a 2 night stay for our family of 4. The rooms were spacious, clean, well stocked with toiletries and other essentials. Whilst waiting for check-in, our children played Wii in the Lobby (wonderful after the 1hr flight, taxi ride etc.!) whilst housekeeping checked the room and immediately notified that it was ready. The monorail is right outside the hotel door and this gave us access to the city, where we caught the train to Circular Quay and the ferry to Taronga Zoo, and the Powerhouse Museum to see the Harry Potter Exhibition. Darling Harbour Shopping Centre was fairly unappealing, but there is a small supermarket, liquor store and restaurants that you can buy take-away food from. We ate at a restaurant in Darling Harbour one night - NOT a pleasurable experience, we waited over 1 1/2 hrs for our main meal to arrive and NO we did not order an entree!!! Second night decided to eat in the room! We ordered room service for the children from the children's menu with extra vegetables. The steak had been overcooked and the mashed potato, whilst yummy for adults was laden with pepper. We pre-paid extra for breakfast, well worth it when travelling with younger children. The choice was excellent and the food fresh. This hotel is also walking distance to the Star Casino - which is where we went to see Annie - the Musical. We found Tumbalong Park - around from Darling Harbour - a fantastic series of parks, water play areas, carousels etc for children, just before we had to get in the taxi to leave - my kids could have spent half a day playing there and were very disappointed to not have their bathers on! So find it early in your stay!! Checkout hassle-free, taxi waiting to take us to the airport.

I was amazed at how mellow the 20,000 or so people were when leaving a venue down by the harbor after the fireworks displays. And not even cops lining the streets as I'm sure New York City must have. A memorable event I will put down in my books. We stayed at the Novotel and had a fantastic view of the beautiful Darling Harbour. The employees are nothing but helpful and kind all around there. The Lovely bar and Restaurant were situated right on the beautiful viewing areas with nice patios attached. I would definitely come back to this hotel on my own vacationing time. It is centrally walkable to most anywhere in the city. The Maritime Museum is free and almost right across the street. And the Sydney Aquarium is right across the Darling Harbour, very close. Approx. 1.5 miles from the Opera House and Botanical Gardens. Approx. 2 miles to Harry's famous Meat Pies, a world famous take out meat pie stand. The hotel is also connected to a mall so you walk right across the bridge and there are restaurants and shopping areas within close proximity. And don't forget to take the ferry's and explore the many more areas of Sydney. December 31 was a lovely time to travel weatherwize.

Lets start with the pluses: 1) location, location, location! It's practically on the waterfront of Darling Harbour (immediately behind the Harbourtown shopping centre, and looking over it to the water) and thus was a great spot for our visit to various Darling Harbour attractions. 2) The staff bent over backward to be friendly and helpful. Even when circumstances were less than optimum (more on this later), the staff made every effort to be helpful, cooperative and cheerful. 3) The restaurant was nice. The negatives are a bit harder to explain easily. There were a couple of straightforward ones, such as the fact that the bathroom supplies were el-cheapo ones that really weren't up to the standard we'd expect in an over-$300-per-night room, or the rather tired decor. (Plain beige carpets really don't age well, and cheapish veneer furniture tends to scratch easily.) But the main issues are a bit harder to define without a bit of explanation. They were a bunch of on-their-own fairly trivial things that added up to paint a picture of a hotel whose management seem a little unclear how to support staff to make it possible for them to provide the really great service that a top-class hotel can offer. For example, we booked online some months before the trip, and booked the most expensive room option (Executive) in the hope of getting a really nice room with a great harbour view (as the website promised us). When we got there, the room was a bit tired and shabby, and (being on the 3rd floor) the view was a bit disappointing. So we asked if we could swap to another room higher up - only to be told, very apologetically by the receptions staff, that it wasn't possible. Booking in advance didn't, it seem, mean that we could actually be allocated an actual real room that early - the hotel admin systems don't work that way. We just got whatever room was free when we arrived. Um, ookay. Then there was the saga of the broken tv. It wasn't working, probably due to a broken connector or cable between the tv and the cable box. The staff member who attempted to help us with this, George, was a friendly fount of helpfulness who did everything he could short of sprouting wings in order to try to fix the problem, However, he wasn't able to actually fix anything because he didn't have the key to the locked cabinet containing the cable box. The engineers, apparently, keep those keys. And because we were staying at the Novotel over christmas, the engineers were apparently all on holiday. So despite George's best efforts, the tv remained broken. On the bright side, this broken tv did manage to score us the room change that our request to the reception desk the day before had been unable to secure, so that was a plus. To sum up, great location, great staff, small problems seemed hard to fix, overpriced for the standard of the room.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiama", "Title": "\u201cStay at Novotel\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR122123950", "Content": "We had a great time while staying at the hotel.

Room was clean and beds comfortable. Great location near transport, restaurants and food court, plus shops. Easy access to all of Sydney from here. Our sons special sleeping buddy was somehow caught up in the bed linen and disappeared. We asked at reception and they said they would look, but we doubt they did. Sadly our son lost his buddy and was quite distressed about it. The toy was black and 45cm long so not a small item. No offer of assistance from the hotel, so that was unfortunate, considering they caused the issue. But with that aside, the reception, concierge and staff were friendly, and nice. Not overly helpful with the loss of Bullseye. We have stayed here many times and continue to return due to its location. We did have room service one night, it was good quality, delivered hot and within a good timeframe. I would recommend this hotel to others due to its location and beautiful views. Get a harbour view room, as its lovely to watch the day turn to night. I have stayed there with our family on several occasions and with a friend on separate trips.

The view was amazing and beautiful \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 which goes back to my comment about the great location. But my biggest gripe is the service. Hotels have very little chance to engage with and impress their customers, so check-in, check-out and other rare encounters are an opportunity to delight or disappoint \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and this place disappointed. Check-in and check-out both took ages and, because of the layout with a huge pole right near the front desk, there was no discernable queue \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 some guests didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice the queue so just walked straight up to the counter before others waiting for ages, and the staff didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice or say anything \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their job, not ours! So it led to an awkward exchange between tired travelers. And then the bell-boy refused to help me get my car out of the carpark, and told me I had to wait in line at front desk one floor up for a ticket to exit. The line was about 30min long so I went back down and requested some assistance to exit \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 again refused to help until I literally had to ask him for the managers mobile number to get some assistance. To top it off, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Manager\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was then flippant and sarcastic when helping. To me, this place seems to suffer from an attitude of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need your business, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing just fine thank you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Booking was a bit of a pain as was told different information with hotelclub, but a call direct to the hotel was all that was needed. I organised a fruit platter for my mum as we went for her birthday and it was all organised when we arrived. Nice little treat for her. Everyone we dealt with at the hotel was friendly and never had an issue. Extra towels promptly brought to the room, room service quick and fresh, reception & porter very helpful. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, not because of the price, but we have a few places we like to have breakfast in Darling Harbour & Circular Quay. We paid around $200 per night which I think is reasonable, it's generally what we pay for hotels when we travel. Had a few drinks at the bar.. not overly expensive, you expect those prices in hotels.

As other reviewer mention, I'd like to confirm that this hotel, location wise is very strategic close to ferry quay and monorail station. It is within walking distance to Sydney Exhibition Center. But, if you don't like to walk too far for shopping to the city, then try to find hotel at the other side of the harbour. For the room, for mine, it is spacious and has a magnificent view. Internet connection will cost you about 24AUD for 24h access, bu if you just need for email checking, at the lobby, you get internet access for 30 minutes free, daily.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "BUnbury", "Title": "\u201cThumbs Up for the Novotel in Darling Harbour\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR111687145", "Content": "We only had 1 night, but your hotel is really great.

Rooms were large and clean, well fitted out, mini bar fridge, tea/coffee making facilities, ipod docking station if that floats your boat. Next door is the Harbourside shopping centre with specialty shops and lots of eateries that face the waterfront. Several convenience stores in the back street as well as the 24 hour Pyrmont Pub just down the road. The Maritime museum is 100 metres away which has a bus stop for the 443 bus that takes about 18 minutes to get to Circular Quay bus/rail/ferry terminal. On the other side of the museum is the Pyrmont Bay ferry wharf (200 metres) where the ferry will take you to Circular Quay in about 25 minutes (a great ride that takes you right under the Sydney harbour Bridge). Outside the hotel is the light rail/tram stop that will take you to the Star City Casino (walk there in 5 minutes) or Paddy's Markets. Outside is also the Monorail station that will take you around the CBD. You can walk across the footbridge to more eateries, wildlife display, aquarium, and the Darling Harbour King St Wharf 3 ferry terminal (600 metres) where ferries will take you to Circular Quay and places like Cockatoo Island, Homebush, Parramatta, etc. The Sydney Ferries and Sydney Buses websites are great and you can print off pdf timetables, route maps, etc. We only ate breakfast in the hotel, not good value and the glass lids on hot food serving pans made it difficult to hold your plate, serve food and hold the glass lid at the same time, a really dumb idea! On the last day (Monday) pastries and bread were either soggy or stale, yuk. Go to the Harbourside centre next door to the pancake restaurant, downstairs at the foot bridge end, very popular and cheaper. There are heaps of cafes and restaurants around the waterfront open for breakfast as well. Check in is 2pm check out 11am, for early check in they want to charge $30 for a room upgrade, for late check out $10 or $20 per extra hour (can't remember exactly) Below reception there is a free baggage check in/storage service, so suggest check in your bags, take a tour, have a meal and come back when you need to. They have a business centre, internet cafe and a cocktail bar which is pretty quiet, Ok for a glass of wine and a coffee after your night out on the town. Don't know about the pool as it was a cold weekend and not a priority, as for the gym, wouldn't have a clue. A handy tip, when in Sydney buy the MyMulti 1 day $20, 2 day $40 or weekly $57 tickets that allow you on all ferries, buses and trains. You can buy them at the newsagent in Harourside shopping centre, the 7/11 in the back street or the other convenience store. The light rail/tram and monorail tickets are from vending machines at stops.

When asked about, the response was as if I was lying about it or that I didn't know how to use the dock! Then the worst was when I came back late from work and ordered room service at 8.30pm, only to receive it very late at 10.00pm after several calls to room service and asking to speak to a manager on the night. That was unacceptable for a 4.5 star hotel to forget my order, only to be told when I made the 1st enquiry on why it took so long that it would come up in 10 minutes! My order was not placed at all! To top that off the food (chips) were cold and not cooked properly. I had lost my appetite by then and the complimentry offer wasn't good enough for me! Then the next day I stayed there, I came back from work to find my room wasn't serviced. I called housekeeping to find out and they told me I'd left the DD on the door. This wasn't true as when I came back to room the tag was lying on the floor in the hall way. In any case, they didn't clean the room but was happy to come in to see what Mini Bar I'd spent! How ridiculous is that?? My room needed new coffee cups and the tray of breakfast wasn't taken away, so left the room quite messy to be in. Although they got housekeeping to come up and clean the room, I wasn't satisfied as this time was eating into my own time. I wanted to rest after a long day, instead I had to wait for management to call me & send up housekeeping. Then the house keeping people had the audacity to tell me I had left the DD sign out again. How rude of them to accuse me of doing this? The guest and customer's are right, don't argue or allude to make them feel like they are lying! The manager tried to assure me that he'd look after me on my next stay and offered free nights etc. but to date I haven't heard back from them and it's been over 2 days since my email feedback on what bad experience I had had during my stay!

I could hear this programme clearly throughout my room. I doubt anyone was in this room since the 3 min programme carried on looping until I checked out hours later. The pedestrian entrance to this hotel from Darling Harbour is bizarre. If you try to enter at street level you're in for a treat in riding a filthy car park lift and left wondering what level do you get out on. The entrance lobby for foot traffic is very average and the reception area is cramped; in fact I wondered if the queue I was standing in was even for the reception. The in-room Internet costs $27 for 24 hours but comes with only a miserly 100MB of allowance. The two hour option for $9 allows only 10MB of data. The business centre is tiny and offers no privacy from others using it. The are countless good hotels nearby. I suggest you choose one of these alternatives. This hotel simply isn't good enough when compared to the alternatives.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cSusan Franks\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR106588123", "Content": "My only fault was that we could not check into our room till 4pm and had to sit and wait, couldn't go far as we had wet weather and being partly disabled, but overall was not a bad stay, just wish we were a bit higher up than the 3rd floor and not in a room by the lifts as was a bit noisy when other guests were either waiting or getting out of the lifts", "Date": "May 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201ctrip to sydney\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR106432824", "Content": "The service we received during our stay at the Novotel on Darling Harbour was excellent.

For my latest trip, I was disappointed to learn that neither hotel had any rooms available for my proposed trip. When our travel agent suggested that I stay at the Novotel at Darling Harbour, I was a little unsure as I hadn't stayed anywhere that wasn't a five minute walk to my office before. Notwithstanding that, I went with our travel agent's recommendation and booked into the Novotel at Darling Harbour. I have to say that I was delighted with this decision from the moment that I arrived. Every staff member that I met was extremely courteous and genuinely appeared to want me to enjoy my stay at the hotel. I was particularly impressed that one of the managers at the hotel came over to welcome me when they overheard that this was my first stay at the hotel - you just don't receive that level of service at many hotels around the world. Once I reached my room, I was thrilled to see the most spectacular view of the Sydney skyline. You can see the entire length of the city in a view that compares favourably with any of the harbour view hotels in Sydney. The room itself was extremely large with all of the modern facilities that you would expect in a five star hotel. The bathroom was well equipped with everything that I needed for my stay. Given that I arrived quite late in the evening, I decided to order room service. I was very happy with the selection of menu items available at 10pm and I was stunned to see that the hotel wasn't going to charge me an exorbitantly high delivery fee for room service. Having the hotel charge $8 to deliver room service to my room is a pet hate of mine - just tell me where the kitchen is and I'll come and collect it myself! When I am paying $34 for a Sheraton or Westin hamburger, I don't expect the hotel to take an extra cut on top of that! In the morning, I was considering catching a taxi to my office, but given that it was a nice morning I decided to walk. I have to say that the stroll over the Darling Harbour bridge to the centre of the City was one of the nicest starts to a working day that I can remember. Just be careful of the bike riders flying over that bridge!!! In summary, I will definitely be staying at the hotel again, regardless of whether the Sheraton or Westin have availability.

I had made an on-line booking through their website for my wife and I to spend the weekend in Sydney . We had tickets to see \"Dr Zhivago\" at the Lyrique Theatre, Star City so the Novotel Darling Harbour was the logical choice for accommodation. Much to our dismay, when my wife and I arrived at Novotel reception, there was no record of our booking having been made! There was a reservation in the name of someone with the same surname but different first name. After a lot of inconvenience waiting for checks to be made then having to use the business centre telephone (someone in India I think), we were able to get a confirmation number from the Advantage + call centre which then facilitated our booking being established. The young fellow we dealt with at reception (Kevin his name was) was very helpful and gave us free parking \"Shh\" he said - this would have cost us $40 x 2 = $80) as well as giving us a free upgrade to a harbour view suite at no cost. While the original reservation was made under a \"no change\" policy, he very kindly gave us the parking and upgrade as compensdation for the inconvenience we had been put through. Our room was huge with a beautiful comfortable bed and which overlooked the whole of Darling harbour being on the 6th floor. During our stay, all of the staff we came into contact with from cleaning staff through to reception, bar staff etc were all very courteous and helpful. In addition, for the purpose of our two night stay, the hotel was convenient to Star City and a beaut French restaurant just along from the hotel, \"The Little Snail\", where we dined - excellent food and service so we highly recommend it. Bookings can be made on-line there as well - just Google \"The Little Snail\". Access to all the Sydney CBD shops is very handy via the monorail which is at the front door of the Novotel. The monorail is a bit pricey for a single fare ($4.90) so the best bet is to buy a mutiple fare pass if you intend doing more than a couple of trips on it. At peak times it can be a case of \"standing room only\" so be prepared. All things considered, and based on our experiences, we would definitely go back to the Novotel Darling Harbour.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cConvenient Location, Comfortable Stay\u201d", "Author": "hcorn", "ReviewID": "UR101316031", "Content": "This is a hotel with a modern minimalist feel.

We booked harbour front rooms and the views of the fireworks were amazing. That was the good parts of our stay. On the negative side - I found the hotel to be a bit dated and needed a good clean. Our bathroom's tiles had mould and it looked like it needed to be scrubbed. The hallways and common areas looked really tiered and unkempt. There were lots of food scraps littering our hallway. Also, it was a very hot day and the A/C in our room did not seem to be able to cope with the heat. My kids were very disappointed with the size of the hotel's pool - it is smaller than most backyard pools! It was a hot day the kids wanted to go for a swim - but it was almost impossible with the number of people trying to use it and the size of the pool. I found this really unacceptable for a hotel of this size. For the money I will look else ware next year. .", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sysney", "Title": "\u201cWill do it again soon\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR96181949", "Content": "The view was just great.Breakfast is every thing you could ask for.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brisbane", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful View\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR96070792", "Content": "We had a great room facing down the harbour.

After the first night stay, we realised why the reception staff was surprised when we checked in for 7 nights stay. We were in Sydney to celebrate our anniversary and my husband wanted a room with the view of the harbour, so we thought this hotel would be a good choice. Little did we know how poor a choice that turned out to be! We barely got any good night sleep for our stay here. Apart from extremely uncomfortable bedding, we were woken up every morning at about 5 or 6am in the morning when our neighbour showered, or when the cleaners cleaned the room next door at 7am. The walls had no sound proofing at all. We were quite lucky in that we were staying at Level 9 and were assigned a room right at the end of a wing so we had less corridor traffic. Nonetheless, we could still hear conversations and noises from the corridor or next door as clearly as they were inside our room. There was absolutely no feel of luxury that it claimed in its advertisements. Our room, which was supposedly Superior Darling Harbour View Room, provided very uncomfortable spring coil queen sized bed and extremely flimsy feather pillow. I have no expectation of high class bedding, but one that had hard metal coils poking straight up my body to undo months of chiropractic therapy is certainly not classed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Superior\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There was some notice hanging from the shower head encouraging people to use the timer to save water. That would have been a great idea had the timer actually worked. The feeling I got from that and the basic furnishings was that the hotel was just being stingy rather than actually wanting to play a part in saving the environment. Apart from that, the room came with very minimal amenities of 2 cakes of soap, shampoo and bath gel. I had to personally go to the reception to get a shower cap. Come prepared with your own lotion and conditioner and anything else that you may need. On cleanliness aspect, we were not overly pleased with it. Our used tea cups were not washed and there were moulds growing on the outside of the bath tub. I suppose the cleaners were playing their part in not wasting water in proper cleaning. We pre-paid a bottle of red on arrival from Real Escapes holiday agent. That, of course never arrived. Having waited a couple of days with no signs of it ever arriving, my husband enquired it at the reception. The staff said that was not communicated to them by the agent and would send the bottle up to our room. As it was already about 10pm, my husband said to just deliver it to the room the next day. That bottle of course, never arrived the next day. But upon inquiry, the hotel reception claimed that a bottle of champagne had been delivered to our room around 4pm, when we were obviously out of the room. That bottle of champagne was no where to be found in the room and to make the matter worse, the hotel reception accused us of trying to take advantage of their complimentary wine. For a start, we had paid for a bottle of wine. My husband had mistakenly thought that it would have been romantic to have it in our room upon arrival. Another problem is the poor communication within the staff. In the booking slip that we have shown to the first reception staff, it clearly said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bottle of Bancroft Estate Wine on arrival\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. How that had changed to a bottle of champagne is beyond me. Also, why a bottle of chilled champagne is delivered to an empty room and later disappeared still remained a mystery to me. I would have thought that it was basic common sense to ring up the room before delivering the champagne or marking it as undelivered when no one answered the door. When the room service guy finally delivered our wine, it was of course a bottle of white, not red. And of course, the room service fellow insisted the champagne was delivered earlier despite not being able to explain how there was no trace of it ever being there. Things certainly got even more interesting as the same reception staff who accused my husband of extorting complimentary wine phoned back later to tell us the wine that we have pre-paid for was meant to be delivered after we returned from our trip, and that the bottle given to us was a complimentary bottle. Well, it has been 2 months and we still have not received the elusive bottle of Bancroft Estate Wine. Had we known that that was going to happen, we would have saved our money and bought our favourite bottle from our local bottle shop at a fraction of the price with no hassles after we returned from the trip. I have honestly never heard of hotels sending wines that were meant to be presented upon arrival after the people have left. I am not sure how these people who could not even understand and carry out basic orders could run a hotel business. If you expect a first class hotel experience, go elsewhere! This hotel is definitely lacking in every single way. With poor customer service, uncomfortable bedding, questionable cleanliness and provision of very basic amenities, I would recommend getting pampered elsewhere!", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201chuge rooms, nice views\u201d", "Author": "claui", "ReviewID": "UR80537413", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights while my partner was attending a conference.

The towel rack was unscrewed and loose, the room had a horrible smoking smell, I asked for another room and explained I had booked directly with the hotel to avoid any misunderstandings, as I have children and this was a dream holiday.... we were later given another room but had to wait 2 hours for them to clean, bath robes were asked but never given until one day the housekeeping lady said the hotel was too full and that's why I never got bath robes, even towels I had to remind to be replaced, many little things that when added up against the 300 per day rate (room only) it was simply not worth. Carpet at the breakfast restaurant is beyond the joke, dirty, very very old.... I think they got all they could out of that carpet. It really needs to be replaced, there are literally HOLES on it, why should a customer have to remind the hotel about such things? The hotel had this night feel about it, so you could see men entering the elevator while drinking beer which I don't find appropriate to mix with children. They also have this \" gaming room\" which attracts gamblers of course. I like casinos, but this is not what I was looking for..... I was looking for a Family stay. In other words, it may be good but not for someone who wants a family holiday with children to enjoy the Aquarium , Zoo, wildlife World etc..

We had booked a Luxury Harbour View Room. The young lady that checked us in at reception was far from welcoming and certainly was not friendly. I noted whilst waiting that she just did not smile at anyone. Perhaps she was just having a bad day however it is my opinion that these front desk reception employees play a very important part as they are your first impression of a hotel and can affect how you judge it. They are usually the first point of contact. Checked in we went off to our room on the fifth floor, the room contained a smaller than expected window which provided a somewhat restricted view of the end of Darling Harbour, the bed looked not much larger than a double bed size and did not look at all inviting, and later proved to be quited uncomfortable. Not what one would expect from a luxury room. The bathroom accessories were limited to conditioning shampoo and soap which I thought was rather poor provision for a luxury room. I was told when checking out that if you require anything extra that you have to ask for it. One would think then that this be the case that there would be a notice in the bathroom to advise you of these facts. The bathroom could have been cleaner as could have the room which had dirty marks on the carpet and dirty finger marks over the entrance doors and other doors. As I am particular about cleanliness I cleaned the areas not up to my expected standard with my hand wipes. There was also a glass that had what looked like the remains of lipstick on the rim. My overall impression was that the room and bathroom had only had a very quick clean. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast at the hotel and have no complaints about the staff or the food service in this area.. We have supported this chain of hotels throughout our travels overseas and in Australia and have a Platinum A-club an indication of our support. Yesterday through the post we received an invoice with an added charge stating it was for undeclared mini bar usage for beer and mixed spirits neither of which my husband or I drink. This had obviously been charged to our visa card. You can imagine how annoyed we were when we at no time accessed the mini bar. One would think that a telephone call just to check whether you perhaps did use the mini bar and forgot would have made for good public relations. I have telephoned the hotel and I must admit the person that took my call was extremely nice and most apologetic however he advised me to put my complaints in writing and address them to the Hotel Management. This I have done and I am now awaiting their reply. I see by reading Trip Advisor that I am not the only one to be billed for mini bar that they did not use. I wish I had research this hotel on Trip Advisor prior to our visit and I would have been better prepared or booked somewhere else.

The hotel is in a superb location, located in a quieter section of Sydney overlooking Darling Harbour and next to a shopping mall. We got harbour views on 7th floor and the views through windows were amazing. Check-in was very quick and staff from the concierge to reception, were friendly. The hotel exudes a modern and upmarket feel. But don't be fooled. For the price you pay, you are only paying for the view and location, and that's it. For the money you pay, I get the feeling that hotel management is rather stingy in providing the little extras. They do not provide complimentary toothpaste, toothbrush, comb, shaving cream, shower cap, sanitary bag for the ladies, not even complimentary bottled water. The hotel sells toothpaste at a pricey $4. With liquid and gel restrictions when travelling by air and carrying handbag only, the hotel by not providing complimentary toothpaste, toothbrush and shaving cream was rather annoying. The only complimentary things were liquid shampoo, mini soap bars and shower gel that were stocked in the bathroom. Some things are complimentary on request, like disposable slippers, but we only found out after reading the small print in the hotel guest booklet. I think management is hoping that guests won't read this in the name of saving costs. Don't expect these little extras like you find in similar priced hotels, especially in Asia. It seems like the wallet in this place is full of moths. I seem to agree with other reviewers here: the bed was rather uncomfortable. The mattress was well past its use by date as there was hardly any cushioning support left. You were literally sleeping on spring coils. The mattress was uneven and on my side, was sloping downwards. We booked a harbour view room which was great but beware the windows are rather dirty. It seems the hotel is on a very tight budget and only clean windows once in a blue moon. The newspapers were not delivered to our room, but other rooms had them. Perhaps they differentiate guests depending on the rate they pay. This hotel mainly targets corporate travellers. It offers convenient express check-out by encouraging guests to place rooms keys in an envelope and dropping it inside a box at reception area. If you like a corporate type hotel with less personalised service, this is the place to be. The hotel does not cater for honeymooners as it is reluctant to even place a couple of chocolates in the room upon arrival. Don't get me wrong, There is a positive point with this hotel: the staff are professional and friendly. The concierge on the base floor does acknowledge and greet you. When we requested a pair of slippers late at night, Paul, a reception staff, delivered them within 5 minutes and with a smile. In summary: Plus points - location, quiet, Darling Harbour views, efficient and friendly staff, express check-out. Negative points - feels like a low frills hotel, just above Ibis Hotel.

Breakfast was good, big range, it was school holidays and there was lots of families and lots of kids, but there was lots of tables as well. We got a seat straight away each morning. We had one dinner in the hotel - nice but pricey. The pool is not heated. It was too cold for me early in the morning, this was April, but I was told it was ok later in the day. There's lots to do around the hotel, and there's a good shopping mall next to it. To get to the hotel, we took the train from the airport, then the tram to Darling Harbour - total $36 each. We took the shuttle bus back, slightly cheaper, and it took about the same time.", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel, had a great getaway\u201d", "Author": "lizsrs", "ReviewID": "UR61969093", "Content": "okay the hotels location is its selling point.... of course it looks like they are starting to do a revamp in the reception area. so maybe the apperance of the hotel will get a face lift.... yes the hotel is clean, tidy comfortable, was treated well by staff. it ticked all my boxes. l enjoyed the location and the room was good didnt have a problem with the bed we did have a romantic weekend. had great views of the harbour, at night it looked great.... bathroom was big enough for the two of us. clean.... enjoyed my time there.. yes it is a little overprice for the standard room but would only stay in that location in darling harbour.... if you dont want to spend as much for a room then stay at the hotel ibis in darling harbour they are in the same location with same views but cheaper... however l will keep coming back to the novotel.....

The dirty dishes left in the halls for days and the housekeeper busting into our room unannounced were annoying and dissapointing but the real issues started after we left.

Then we were charged for the minibar purchases of the people that stayed in the room the following night!

The Accor website describes these rooms as having all the features and facilities of the Superior Darling Harbour View Room but with \"added products and services\". The \"Executive Room\" provided no added products and facilities of any description. When senior management were challenged about this the assistant general manager could not describe what the \"added products and facilities\" should be. This was because he'd \"only been on the job for 2 days\". The duty manager could not describe what they should be either! Overall the hotel passed off a superior room as being \"Executive\" and gave absolutely nothing by way of enhancements; not even a complimentary bottle of water. The Accor website is misleading and the fact this hotel passes off 'normal' rooms as being 'executive' (and charging a significant premium) is, in my view, highly dubious and downright dishonest. Turning to the room quality itself; the rooms are described as 'modern'. Again, this hotel has a strange idea of what is modern. These rooms have not been refurbished since the early to mid 1990's in my view. The rooms have very dated decor, poor facilities, poor ventilation and air conditioning and give an instant 'tired' look upon entering. The first room I was allocated had a bath tub with so many cracks that they had to be filled in with grey plasticine! The 2nd room was barely much better. The bathrooms are a complete disgrace and have not been properly maintained. Despite paying over AUD$ 2500 for my stay in an 'Executive' room I was still expected to then pay $35 per day parking, $31 per day breakfast (assuming one wanted it) and a disgraceful $27.50 a day for \"high speed\" internet, which was CAPPED at 100mb! The internet was anything but \"high speed\" and barely had dial up speeds at times. All these points were raised with the assistant GM; he could offer no adequate explanation. He offered to \"make me happy\"; this appears to have been by way of 2 'comped' breakfasts (I was there for 9 nights). So, no \"extra products and services\" as I was entitled to in that room class, just AUD$62 by way of 2 comped breakfasts. Ultimately this hotel was overpriced, tired, and offered very poor value for money. Management were offered a fair opportunity to rectify issues and explain why the Executive Rooms were not being provided in accordance with Accor's standards. Unfortunately management failed to respond in any sensible fashion. I suspect the 'plan' is to rely on the heavy tourist traffic and 'fleece' the guest for as much by way of incidentals as possible. The internet charges are disgraceful; the internet service is too slow and does not justify the outrageous cost. This hotel has a 4.5 stars rating. In my view 3 stars would be generous. Yes this hotel is well located, the rooms are on the larger side, but for the price I would recommend looking elsewhere, and obtaining far better value for money. I really do think that this hotel misleads guests as to the quality of rooms and services expected in each room type. Further, the management do not take guests concerns seriously and simply dismiss them with corporate \"waffle\". A complete and utter disgrace!

Perhaps that added to the cost of the nightly stays due to timing. Overall, it's just a basic, average & \"no frills\" hotel that provides most of the comfort a business traveller would need (especially if working at the Convention center) albeit at a hefty price for the quality -- in my opinion -- making it not worth the price our company was paying. So, while not too many issues arose during my week stay there, I wouldn't say it was anything special. The rooms are plenty spacious -- I had a comfy bed, wet bar area, refridgerator, hairdryer, safe, large desk area, nice bathroom that was spacious. A++ for the largest and most comfortable bath towels! I could occassionally hear my neighbor's television, but, the Australia Day celebrations were not very loud despite the crowds, speakers, etc. going on in the harbor just outside my window. The location is awesome -- very convenient to working the Convention Center, right next to wharf shopping and INCREDIBLE Syndney dining options, close to grocery (small one in shopping center next door -- larger chain store -- Coles is about two blocks away). Because of that, I never ate in the hotel. Darling Harbor has an IMAX theater, the Aquarium, access to ferries that can take you to the Circular Quay, was close to lots of other attractions and not too far to walk to city center, etc. I walked everywhere (The Rocks, the Botanical Gardens, etc.) and enjoyed that aspect of the hotel's location. It was about $40 taxi to/fro Airport (but there is a cheaper shuttle service available). NEGATIVES: Decor and everything gave a tired and \"worn\" around the edges feel, such as: stains in tub and shower walls, slighty smudged walls and molding, carpet not so bad (some colleagues thought their carpets very dirty), out-dated furniture styling (i.e. mid-80's feel). Television left a lot to be desired -- about 8 different FOX channels and a few local channels, CNN, that was about it. Oh, and I judge hotels by the type and # of hangers they provide in the closet. Since these were the type where the ring part is unremovable and stays on the bar (i.e. afraid that guests will steal their hangers) this place gets another ding. Only low-end chains do this anymore. Secondly, there really was no \"dresser\" or drawers to put things in -- the closet did provide extra shelves, though. On walking to my room the first time, the hallways were disgusting -- bits of trash and food and junk all over the place. The carpet in the hallways was old and outdated as well. Staff: I would say they could use some work on training the Clerks on check-in. First, there were two lines that formed instead of one queue so as some of us stood in the \"slow\" line, the queue next to us rotated through guests. Those working behind the counter clearly noticed what was going on. What modern hotel services guests this way at the front desk? It's not a grocery chain! Finally, the clerk that checked me in initially was pretty rude and unpleasant, i.e. the \"slow\" clerk. I forget her name -- she \"checked\" me in and then at the last minute said that my room wasn't ready yet, which is fine, it was around Noon and too early for checkin but at larger business hotels I stay in it generally isn't a problem. I know clerks deal with rude guests, too. I used to be a clerk as well, so I greeted her with a smile and hello and was very pleasant. She really only had about 15 words in total for me. She couldn't call me either to let me know when my room was ready having an international line, whatever, you won't see better worldwide business chains doing this. So, I was stuck dragging my suitcase back downstairs to storage and then sitting in the lobby. However, my colleague in line next to me, got his room right after I was rejected. And when he asked \"Trainee\" -- the VERY sweet girl working his line, she went and got my room ALSO -- 10 minutes after rude girl said I couldn't have my room and she saw me STILL SITTING IN THE LOBBY that whole time. Trainee unknowingly recharged my credit card the \"Hold\" charge (twice) -- so on top of Rude Clerk Girl doing it already and her two attempts, my Visa card was put on fraud hold and was ultimately denied (but then, they didn't ask or tell me that they are getting a \"call credit company\" code which is in my experience, 100% what the little credit machine feeds back to them in these cases). ANYWAY.... Finally, they provide 4 \"free\" \"computers\" to use the \"internet\" in the lobby. You log in with your name and you get 20 minutes. What a joke! I attempted to use these machines at least 7 times and each time: only one really worked for another guest, the internet would never connect, the machines would often error out (I went to front deskt a few times to get them to reboot the system and they even admitted that the network is bad and the machines always have problems)! This is so they want you to pay the OUTRAGEOUS $27.95 a DAY and that's for ONLY the FIRST 100 MB. So, if you use up your 100 mb in the first 24 hours, you have two options: super slow network w/in that same 24 hours for free or you can pay another crazy fee by hour thereafter for high speed -- that's right, you already paid $27.95 -- so it can very easily be much more than $27.95 per 24 hour period. I saw the management response to another post -- that's BS. For the price we paid per day Internet should be included especially if they expect business travellers. 100 mb is nothing anymore.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and location.

We have stayed here before and didn't have any problems. The trip and the stay itself were not the problem. The problem lies with the on-selling of the Accor Vacation Club and their extremely bad delivery (or lack of) service afterward. On a trip down to the bar we were approached by an Accor Salesman, who was offering a return trip to a number of selected hotels, for two nights for a family for $99.00. This had to be signed up, paid, and a hotel chosen on the night. In return the Novotel had our income details, marrital status, and all our contact details. We signed up to return to the Novotel Darling Harbour, since we frequently visit Sydney, paid our $99.00, received a contract, and were given 6 months to use it. Given that the 6 month period is almost up, I tried to book this accommodation. This is where the problem starts. The 1800 number on the form had an answer machine stating \"this office is currently closed\". After leaving it over the weekend and trying again this morning at .00am and finding the same message, I decided to contact the hotel directly, and was given the run around for 3 hours with different numbers to phone (some disconnected), some asking me to hold for approx 13 mins. Eventually I reached the number I had initially tried and was told \"we are in Queensland, so our business hours are different\". First problem - being a national booking office why does their answer machine not stipulate opening hours, and that they are in Queensland?? Problem 2 is that they \"no longer offer this package in Sydney, as they are rennovating\" (the sales office where we had to attend to receive this special \"deal\"). But, I was told I could go up to Queensland to take it, or take the refund. My point being; they didn't just rennovate the sales office at the drop of a hat. They had to have known in advance about this rennovation, and these packages were being sold to be taken \"anytime within the 6 month timeframe\". Accor was obviously quite happy to take $99 knowing full well these wouldn't be on offer in the future. Problem 3; they have all our income details, marrital status, contact details in return for something that seems to have been a bit of a hoax. Problem 4; On trying to contact Accor about this problem I was told they weren't infact rennovating, they were re-structuring. I'm sorry Accor, but what's it to be, rennovating, or re-structuring??? In any which way, you had our contact details, surely you could have contacted us to tell us that you would no longer honour the contract? And please don't bother to write your automated response of \"if you would contat the hotel directly we will be happy to discuss the matter further.........\" as I have this morning for three hours, nobody from the hotel wishes to take responsibility or give me someone I can talk to, as Accor is a seperate entity to the Novotel Darling Harbour - If that is the case, why then were you allowing Accor to hawk their product in your bar/foyer on your premises??? I'm sure the ice-cream man would not have been allowed to sell his product without being removed - Not to mention how your employee tried to flog us off a Audi Car while we were in your bar.

This appeared not to be a standard room as my colleagues had much smaller rooms. The hotel were very happy to allow early check in and to provide non feather pillows and duvets when asked. The room was clean and well stocked with towels, toiletries etc. The bathroom was ok but we never managed to get the hot/cold taps sorted out for the shower. Bathroom and public areas (particuarly landings) could have seen better days. As expected internet and minibar were a rip off. The gym was small but functional and pool a little tired.

Highly recommend Chinta Ria Restaurant on the otherside of the Harbour for a meal - very fresh and cheap and enough buzz not to make you feel self conscious when you're eating alone. The room rate was really good (around $200 including buffet breakfast) but I was disappointed with the breakfast. It is the only criticism I have of my stay and it was probably just timing, but the choices seemed to be lacking and everything seemed to run out just when I wanted it. Also the coffee left a lot to be desired - it took me a couple of mornings to work out how to use the automatic machine and the effort wasn't worth it for me, but I am a coffee snob. Pretty good value otherwise. I did get some noise from next door as my room had an interconnecting door, so best to request a room that doesn't interconnect. The bed was fabulous (I slept in twice!) and the cable channels kept me occupied in the evenings. Easy access to the internet etc. Really good facilities for travelling alone on business.

We understood that check in was 2pm, so we dropped off our lugguge and decided to start our experience in Darling Harbour..e.g the Aquarium & Wildlife park and a look aroung the immediate area. On our return to the hotel at 2.45pm we were told there was a delay in getting our room (executive queen and single habour view, no rollaway bed ..their description of the room, not mine) and to please enjoy a drink at the bar on the house..Wow that's nice we thought.......2 hours later we were still waiting...we then recieved our much anticapated room key and rushed to the elevator knowing a hot shower would only be minutes away. That is when my nightmare started.. I walked into the room, which if booked for just my partner and me would normally be average, but to clearly book a room for my family that states...A unique experience combining relation and focus. The executive room treats you like a VIP: more spacious, with a day bed sofa, all facilities of a superior room as well as Darling Harbour views. Up to 2 adults and child. No rollaway. Oh my God...that was my response when I walked into the room that only had a Queen bed. Where is the other room? That was the next thing that came out of my mouth. Back down stairs we go...Consider our day so far, 4am start 6.30 flight, full day in the city, quite tired and the response I get from the guy behind the counter..and this is exactly what he said word perfect..\"I didn't book your room\" AAArrrrrhhhhh. No, we did and I'm sure that I didn't ask at the time of booking for a 2 hour wait and a side of your attitude. The next thing from this amazing Novotel Representive was the tried and true, \"take a seat and we'll get the manager\". Now, here is when we had to justify our booking and the problems to the manager. We were dumb founded that at some point during the discussion the following comments were made to us, by the manager,\"the day bed is used as a single bed normally\". No, it 's a day bed . Not a bed that I want my daughter to sleep in, that is not what I booked. Secondly, \" we will get you a roll away\"......(See the room discription...NO rollaway). and my favorite comment from the management, \"we only have 2 rooms with seperate bedrooms\", and the closer, from the manager, \"in my time in the industry I've never worked for a hotel that offers this service are you sure your not talking about serviced apartments.....\"? Really, we travel at least once a month both locally in Melbourne, around Australia and Internationally, and have never had an issue like this. Now in some defence of the manager, here.... I must say the complimentary drink at the bar was nice, the knock at the door and the complementary champagne was a nice way of getting me drunk so I would sleep throught the stuck elevatar and it's alarm and the returning Bledisloe Cup rugby fans, so thanks for that. My reponse to all this is, wake up Novotel, gifts and sincere apologise, are all nice and expected, but are just a way to smooth over the fact that you screwed up. Get your service looked at, if you are excepting a big weekend, staff up. If you can't turn around your rooms in time why is it my fault? If you can't write a correct description of your rooms take some truthful photos, (oh you have, note the photo on your website of the family all in one bed....Is that your expectation?....

Right above the waterfront and with lovely views of the city skyline at night. We chose a 1 bedroom suite and paid through the nose for it. It had 2 levels with main bed on upper floor like a loft. There is also a small landing outside the bedroom where you can watch tv or use your laptop if you are not sleepy, and it doesn't disturb your partner. Furnishings and decor very modern and clean, bed good. The downstairs has a lounge with bar and separate toilet. Plenty of room for 2 couples or a family if they want to sleep on the sofa. So far so good. What disappointed us was the following: Even though we had a high floor (second from top) and the view was wonderful, it was spoiled by the railed balcony which skirts all the rooms and extends some 10 feet or so out. You can't access it either. We were hoping to get some great night pictures and brought all our camera gear. We thought we'd be able to access the balcony and set up our gear. You can't. You're stuck inside the room with the balcony intruding into all your pics. So we just went down to the wharf and took pics there. The service was standard Novotel, that is, wanting. Had to wait almost an hour for our room even though we arrived during standard check-in time. Staff seemed confused, running around everywhere but not really getting anyplace. Didn't seem to be worried about us and a couple of other guests waiting and waiting for their rooms. Some of the staff simply ignored us. Parking was okay, the usual arm and a leg to stay anywhere in Sydney. You definitely need a map or satnav to find the entrance, it's tricky so be forewarned. You can walk quickly from the hotel through the walkway straight to the Darling Harbour shopping area without getting too wet if it comes down to pour, which it did. Look, the room was comfy, spacious, well laid out and relatively quiet. We had no real complaints about it. But the price they charged was not in sync with the experience we had. We were hoping for something special that we would remember. But then we remembered it was Novotel. Don't expect an experience.

Unfortunately we did not get a room with a view, we had a noisy street beside our window instead. My advice: if you are booking this hotel for the splendid views, make sure you get a harbourside room BEFORE you get to the hotel. We asked if there were rooms available on the other side, were told yes, but were also informed that it would cost 60 extra Aussie dollars per night. We decided not to pay any more for the room as we had the views during a previous visit to another hotel on the other side of the harbour (Four Points by Sheraton - definitely recommended :-)). The staff were not over friendly, which is unusual for Australian hotels. The internet is definitely over-priced. We didn't eat in the hotel at all, we decided to eat in the Harbourside mall across the bridge. You can get all kinds of food in the foodhall in the basement. It's well priced and a 5 minute walk from the hotel room. Access to the harbour is great from this hotel. I would recommend eating at JORDAN'S seafood restaurant if you want to enjoy some good food. Definitely book in advance, it's always busy. The food there is not cheap, but it's worth it. You can also have breakfast in and around the harbour. There is a Morrocan/ Australia retaurant which I would also recommend for dinner in the evenings close to the hotel, it's called SUMAC. The staff are really lovely and the food is great (try the chocolate cupcakes for desert, if you love food like me you will love these). Get one to share though if you have had a main course!

Ours did not have a couch (as shown in pictures on site) and only the upgraded rooms come with increased size, day couch with two double beds. There is a big difference is size of rooms. I must say thought that the bed was one of the softest I have ever slept on with the exception of Sheraton's. We could actually get a good night's sleep!

Free pictures with Koala's at Taronga Zoo ($20 value each), and numerous others. Pick up the guide and coupon book from the Airport just as you get off.

If your visiting the east coast of Australia click on my profile to see other hotels we visited. We stayed at the Novotel Darling Harbour Sydney last of all while touring the East Coast of Australia and it was great to find somewhere where you could get a great sleep with no one next door or above or below you keeping you awake with their noise. The blackout blind is the business, roll it down during the day time and you cant see your hand infront of you, so great for getting a lie in. DEFINATELY 100% ask for a room with a Harbour side view as the view is better than looking on some boring road which you get in the other rooms. Everything about the room was bang on the money, Clean, tidy, cleaned everyday, beds were really comfy could of stayed snuggled up in them all day, furniture bang upto date, modern decoration, all the mod cons, Mini bar which had the prices clearly marked, modern TFT TV not that we used it, wired internet access or wireless internet so you have a few options for internet usage with other providers. all in all nothing what so ever to complain about in the room, bang on the money for us. Rest of hotel Reception The staff were extremely helpful well presented and professional, not the usual stuffy type that look down there noses at you or dont have a laugh with you in these large nice hotels. The wife hurt her leg in one of the revolving doors, for some reason, best known to her she decided to try and get through the door while the gap was no more than 6 inches as it was closing, (dont ask) the automatic motion detectors never detected her foot in the door and continued closing and trapped her foot. She ended up with a nasty cut in her foot, the hotel first aiders and senior management were there in a flash and could not of done anymore to be more attentive if they had tried. They were extremely professional having a full blown first aid kit which would not of looked out of place in an ambulance. The revolving door was immediately turned off and stayed off all day while engineers checked it over. I cant comment on the food or sports/leisure facilites as we never used them, we dont go on holiday to sit in a hotel or use its leisure facilities or restaurants, we go to experiance what the local destination has to offer so we always go out to local attractions etc, you can go to any Accor Hotel anywhere in the world but theres only one sydney so we prefer to use a nice comfy hotel as a base to explore and this hotel certainly met our expectations. We noticed the week we visited was cheaper than when we 1st arrived in sydney 3 weeks earlier, so it may be worth you checking differant dates prices out. LOCAL ATTRACTIONS Monorail. Is right outside the hotel so its easy to hop on and off, For the woment check out the monorail stop of Paddies Market obviously a big market, it also goes to china town and right into the CBD Central Business District and simply does a large loop, Pubs/Bars Families We found families are catered for well in many parts of sydney with regard to eating and drinking, however on the night time unless you are having a meal its pretty hard to simply walk in with the kids for a drink so simply walk in and ask for chips or something small and grab yourself a drink, APART FROM the Darling Harbour area which of course is where the Novotel is located, they have differant rules in darling harbour for kids as its the main tourist area but you still had to be out by 10pm at the latest with Kids, APART FROM the Pyrmont Bridge Hotel, pyrmontbridgehotel.com which we found to be the closest to an english pub in the central CBD area. To find the Pyrmont Bridge Hotel Bar, simply use the Novotels main back door entrance which goes onto the road out the back, turn right so your going down the slight hill and the Pyrmont comes up on your left, take the kids up stairs and you get a great view from their conservatory with pool tables and quizs and food etc and the owner is a really funny character on the microphone cracking jokes with everyone and walking round taking the mickey out of everyone, if your english like us he loves it if you call yourself a pommy and he can take having the mickey taken out of him by you calling him a convict (sorry its an enland v australia thing), its also extremely popular downstairs for singles and couples as its on a busy walkway. Ferries If you want to get a ferry you need to go round to Circular Quay, There are yellow water taxis outside the Novotel right in darling harbour, however as they charge by the person it works out cheaper to simply ask the hotel concierge to grab you a hotel and nip round to circular quay, costs next to nothing. Circular Quay and the Bridge area are where all the ferries are and the Opera House, Check out the Manly ferry and Manly beach its better than Bondi beach after getting off the manly ferry just walk straight across the road down the pedestrianized zone and you will come to the actual beach, most people think the beach either side of the ferry at manly is the correct manly beach its not, walk through the shopping area opposite the ferry terminal. Manly is where they have the aquarium where you can dive with sharks which is what I did. Google SYDNEY SHARKDIVE Opera House and Bridge Photograph For that Spectacular Family Photo with the Opera House behind you and the Sydney Harbour Bridge behind the Opera house all in the same shot, you need to go to Mrs Macquaries Chair, as you look at the opera house in front of you its the green park over to your right and you can easily walk round to it, There are professional photographers there up the top section who for $10AUD will print you out a professional photo taken by them so you know you are getting that once in a lifetime moment captured professionally, get them to copy it to CD or onto your own cameras memory card so you can then print it yourself and email it later, makes more sense as you only get one printed copy otherwise from them, this way you get the photo they have just taken of you on your memory card to print out as many times as you want etc, I asked them and they gladly put my cameras memory card into there laptop and copied the photo they had just taken of us to my cameras memory card which was great as I can now get it printed out at differant sizes etc and framed. Also use Google earth to see just how close Hotels etc are to the centre of towns/cities you are visiting, we found it to be invaluable in making sure we were not stuck in the middle of no where.

The dinner for two only offered a choice of either a entre & main or main & desert from the set menu.. which only had three choices... steak, fish & chicken being the mains. Had the steak the first night which was full of gristle and as tough as a slice of rubber. My partner had the chicken fillet which came with a bone and was rare. Mentioned the lack of choices to the waiter who suggest I will have to eat something twice, when I declined the wine menu we were then ignored all night. Very poor service indeed. Tried the fish the next night which was ok, my partner had the steak which was the other half of the piece of rubber I had the night before.... the next three nights we dinned elswhere. Darling Harbour has many great restaurants which are all superior and less expensive than the Dish. Whilst we had a great room with a nice view of the harbour, room servicing was a joke.

A receptionist said she would get the room manager or front office manager to get in touch with us before we left. This did not happen. I'm not sure if the hotel think that as we were 'leisure' customers we would accept the situation but I can assure you the room they tried to allocate us as 'Deluxe Harbour View' and the service provided was not up to scratch. I believe the hotel acts dishonestly in the way they sell this type of upgraded room. The fact that the staff did not even bother to get a manager to talk to us says volumes about the attitude of staff and the type of establishment this hotel really is.
