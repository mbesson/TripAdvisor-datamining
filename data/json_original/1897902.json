On arrival, we were immediately impressed with the staff who were friendly and helpful from the start. Unfortunately there were a few small issues at first - there was very little floor space due to large beds in the standard size room, and the view I requested turned out to be a wall instead. Also the baby bed they brought for my son collapsed on one side with him in it, he was fine but we sent it back. I went to talk to the staff and they immediately showed me several other options for rooms and ended up upgrading us which met our needs quite well. The hotel is just a 5 minute walk from Aya Sophia and to the Bosphorous as well. It's central to everything in Sultan Ahmet really. There are shops up and down the same small road the Levni is on and you could spend a fortune in them - or just go to the Grand Bazaar which is just a few minutes walking. The staff is out of this world, they put up with our additional baggage, helped us bring our stroller in and out, doted on the kids, all with a smile. Ugur was so nice to us and the kids and wouldn't let us lift a finger. The breakfast buffet was our only meal experience in the hotel, which I would say was OK, not the best buffet but good choices for fruit and breads. The room service menu is sparse, but there are many options nearby. We didnt use the Hammam and spa on the bottom level, but the pool is nice although you have to buy a swimming cap to use it, so bring one along to save the five euros fee. The dry sauna was good, as advertised. The concierge Mrs. Erdem was amazing, friendly, helpful and gave us the best recommendation for the Sultan Ahmet Fish House which was the best meal of our trip by far.

We had an executive double room in the back wing which was nice appointed and very neat. The room was meticulously cleaned each day. The hotel staff was always ready to help with whatever we needed. One of the best part of the stay was Aydin, the concierge.

Our plane arrived later than scheduled and I called the hotel from the airport (massive queue for visas). They advised our free transfer and ensured that the minibus was waiting for us. On arrival, check in was hassle free and the guest relations manager showed us quickly around. All rooms were wonderful. Good size, comfortable beds, complimentary fruit plate and bottle of wine. A large bottle of water was also in room and replenished each day. Wifi had high speed and worked very well during our stay. We only had one problem in one of the rooms with a high temperature and obviously the thermostat wasn't working. Bathrooms were very clean, with good water pressure for showers. They had bathtubs, which may be an issue for some people with mobility problems, but for me meant that I was able to have a relaxing bath in evening!. The breakfast was delicious: orange juice appeared to be freshly squeezed, coffee and tea were good and a varied selection of pastries, cheeses, meats, eggs cooked to order - even real honeycomb! Staff during breakfast were very efficient and even though the hotel began to fill up during the latter part of our stay (Easter approaching), gave professional and rapid service. We used the spa/pool/gym a couple of times. Very handy to have in a city centre hotel. Although it opens at 10am we could call reception who would open the gym for us earlier. The marble floor in spa gets very slippery, so be aware! Staff were absolutely amazing without exception - I can't think of a hotel which I have visited where ALL staff were so genuinely trying to please the guests; from finding cushions to sit on outside whilst waiting for taxis, the cheerful \"good morning\" every day, good restaurant recommendations, organising last minute transport....every query or question was dealt with, with huge smiles and good humour. Even after our departure they are still being helpful; we left some photos in one of the rooms and they contacted us to advise that they would be sent in the post to us, before leaving, the guest relations manager took our photo and has sent it to us....words cannot express how delighted I am with the amiabilty of the staff and their wish for all guests to enjoy their stay in Istanbul. Location was also perfect for us on a short break. It really is in the ideal area for walking to major tourist sites, the ferries and some good restaurants (will be posting trip report on forum later). 3 days really is too short to see everything we wanted to see and all 10 of us agreed that we will be back, and obviously, to the Levni!

We checked in on march 24th and only stayed for 1 night before going to izmir the next day. We arrive early, arround 8 a.m and the check in was quick. We didn't know what to expect since the lobby was so small and the hotel was in a small lane, but when we got to our rooms we were immediately pleased. My friends said their rooms were differ in terms of bathroom design. I heard one friend had a semi-open bathroom that has no door that separates it from the bed room, another has doors but glass doors so it's see through from the bed. In this hotel my friends booked twin rooms, so they share the the room with 1 other, and these bathroom designs made them slightly uncomfortable. We Indonesian aren't use to such less privacy. But they eventually just laugh and make jokes about it. Soon it was thought of as one ofthose weird and funny foreign thing. My experience was different because i went with my husband. Our room was on the forth floor, big, a quite sexy room with 2 windows overlooking the rooftops of istanbul. I woke up at dusk because of jet lag, and watch the sun rised slowly from my window. I woke my husband as soon as there was little lights and he immediately grab his professional camera. It was such a pretty sight! The breakfast was wonderful, i swear i had 4 plates and finished all in minutes. The staff was courteous but the restaurant manager was most gracious! I just love how he sometimes served the guest too. You know how some hotel have strict rules in terms of breakfast? This one allows you to get another one even if you had breakfast earlier. After i went back to the room after breakfast, i came back down to the restaurant to meet my husband. I said to the manager that i had breakfast and just going in to find my husband, he said, \"it's okay, you can have another one if you want to. It doesn't matter. Can i get you anything? Tea?\" Anyway, i find this hotel very nice. They have pool, spa, and hamam too but i didn't get the chance to try it. The location is superb.

The staff were superb - we were only in Istanbul for 2 nights, and they recommended excellent restaurants to us both nights. They also helped with a booking to see the Sema Ceremony of the Whirling Dervishes, and with the best places to go for nightlife. The location of the hotel is ideal - a short walk away from the Grand Bazaar, the Blue Mosque and the Basillica Cistern. The only time we had to take a taxi was to venture over to the Asian side of the city, for our night out.

I was travelling with both young children and elderly parents, who were entranced by the genuine warmth and affection received. In all my years traveling abroad I have never encountered such sincere people, who were pleased to assist you at every turn. A special mention must go to Ozlem who made my children feel so special, and ensured we ate at only the finest restaurants, to Erdem for his constant attention and to the breakfast staff who won over my father in law, no mean feat!! The hotel was perfectly positioned for our needs, in close proximity to the old town, the rooms were as you would expect with a modern feel, and the swimming pool perfect for a four & seven year old who just wanted to have fun.

It is very reasonably priced, in an excellent location with the most friendly and helpful staff. The staff are particularly helpful, they all seem to speak reasonable or good English and were extremely courteous and prompt in responding to all our requests. They gave great advice on trams, eating out, and even e-checked us onto our return flight home. Excellent! The rooms were modern and nicely decorated without being lavish; the beds very comfortable, decent sized and you can choose your type of pillow! and a decent shower room. (Although, note, for the more sensitive, the in-room bathroom/toilet door is transparent). Our family of four had a two room \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcset\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (1101 & 1102) which was very convenient and private. The rooms were quiet despite the central location and, at the time of our stay the Mamara tunnel project being underway in the vicinity. The clean and bright free Spa, fitness room and swimming pool (swim hat obligatory) were enjoyed during our scant free time although my sporty offspring found the pool very small. The food is good and dining room was bright and fresh with decent food and a good selection of healthy breakfast choices. There is little in the way of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclounge area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 although there is a small caf\u00c3\u00a9 and two reception areas. This is very much a city hotel for active \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsite seers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The hotel itself is located very conveniently and centrally in a small cobbled street and looks deceptively small from the outside; the interior has been highly modernised, negotiating its way across different buildings and levels whilst the decor inside is clean and modern. The Levni is a short walk from all the top sites \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Topkapi Palace, Haihia Sophia, Sultanahmet (Blue) Mosque, Basilica Cistern and downhill to the Spice Bazaar, Eminonu port and Galata bridge. The Grand Bazaar is a little further to walk but there are two Tram stops within 200m which will take you to the latter or across Galata bridge to the Tunel, Dolmabahce Palace, Istanbul Modern etc. The tram is very convenient and easy to use - pay machines at each stop return a 2 Lira plastic jeton for coins or notes. We eat out most evenings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are many options nearby and, again, the hotel staff were extremely helpful in suggesting some very good reasonably priced and varied options. We thought this an excellent hotel for a city break for a few days or a week and suited our teenagers well. The staff themselves were great and really helped us to make the most of our stay.

It is situated in the old town area of Istanbul and we found it only 10 minutes walk away from the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia Church/Museum, Archaeological Museum, Topkapi Palace Museum & Grand Bazaar. It is also close to the tram system and taxis are regularly parked at the end of the street. Situated in a small cobbled street, the hotel looks deceptively small from the outside - but the decor and finish inside is modern, clean and Arabian chic. We received a warm welcome on arrival (hotel transfer was arranged by the hotel at a cost), and we booked the only Dublex room in the hotel. Our fellow travelers stayed in a standard double, (which was an excellent size with lovely decor), a large double, (where they were able to include a single fold out bed) with balcony and the Boshorus Suite (which was simply stunning) with views of the Boshorus, and major attractions. The rooms are lovely and clean and have mini bars and hotel safes. Breakfast is included with all rooms and offers a great selection for families. The hotel offers free use of the SPA (except massages) an excellent cafe and restaurant. The biggest asset this hotel boasts is its staff. Turkey is known for its hospitality anyway, but the team in LEVNI are courteous, honest, reliable and go the extra mile. We dealt with the hotel directly via email as our room requirements did not suit normal booking agent options and they were quick and met all of our requirements. We dealt with Irem and Oslem and I would recommend that every potential guest speaks to them before booking - they are truly excellent at meeting requirements and following special instructions. Just have patience with slightly broken english and you will be rewarded. Don't succumb to the allure of the 5 star hotels in Istanbul. Almost all of them are nowhere near the attractions, and this hotel is right up there with the best of them. I can't rate our stay in the hotel high enough. You should not be disappointed.

However, on this trip I had an extra day before departure, so I decided to pick a hotel in Sultanahmet. Given my last-minute plans, almost every hotel was booked full in Sultanahmet, and I ended up at the Levni by surfing Tripadvisor. I paid a premium for the room, because apparently lots of Germans were in town for a football match. The staff at the Levni are exceptional, even for Turkey where the level of service in the hospitality industry is always way above average. The breakfast here (included with my room) was also very good, with many healthy-lifestyle choices. The floor plan was a bit convoluted, but that is to be expected in these older Sultanahmet buildings from what I could tell. To get to my room, I had to cross outside briefly (but still within the Levni building), and then find the elevator. My driver (who works on retainer for my company) was not familiar with navigating at night in Sultanahmet, so it took some time for him to find the hotel. There is absolutely no parking outside; again, normal for this touristy area. When my driver stopped to drop me off at the hotel entrance, he blocked other cars behind him on the narrow street; characteristic of the Turks, they all started learning on their car horns. They love their car horns here more than any place in Europe, but are still bush-league compared to the drivers in India, Egypt, or Indonesia (the top three on my global Worst Drivers list). Anyway, back to the hotel . . . What impressed me most about this remodeled hotel was the cleanliness. The room and the bathroom (small by global standards, but large by Euro standards) were squeaky-clean. The large windows in my room overlooked the Bosphorus, so I woke up to see a beautiful sunrise and a big cruise ship coming into dock on the Asian side of Istanbul. Unlike hotel windows in *#$&%# American hotels which are terrified of lawsuits, these windows could be opened. I had some WiFi issues here, and the signal I got was weak and slow; the hotel needs to install more repeaters and/or upgrade to 802.11n. I cleared the small desk off for work but could not get a decent signal from the desk. I ended up doing my emails sitting on the bed, because I got a stronger WiFi signal there. If there was a business center, I didn't see it; I printed my boarding pass by sending it to the hotel's fax machine. I never visited the spa; not my thing, because spas make me feel like a tossed salad :) But just looking at the brochures, my wife would have liked the hotel spa. Being that I was at this hotel explore Sultanahmet, I liked my choice. But there is no way I would recommend this hotel - - or any hotel in Sultanahmet for that matter - - for business travelers, other than the old prison (Four Seasons). This place is tourist-all-the-way. So if you're here to see Sultanahmet and want a very good hotel staff, I don't think you can go wrong with the Levni.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Lombardia, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat place & fantastic persons\u201d", "Author": "Albert01967", "ReviewID": "UR124106097", "Content": "Been there for holiday the place is gorgeous and the service is really super!

Ozlem and the rest of the staff were very attentive and all requests were promptly attended. The hotel is very clean, and the rooms are well appointed. Hotel is also in a great location. However, it is not without its flaws: 1) The pool, gym, and sauna at the spa were fantastic. However, the Turkish bath was a bit overpriced and not as enjoyable. I would suggest visiting one of the local Turkish baths that are not attached to a hotel. 2) At check out, hotel expenses had to be paid in cash in either Euro or Turkish Lira. This is a bit of an inconvenience because I had to find an ATM and take out a large sum, and paying ATM fees, instead of using my credit card which has no foreign fees.

The decor of the room was luxurious & had all of the comforts one would expect of a top quality hotel. Buffet breakfast the following day was delicious & I particularly liked the omelette station with a chef cooking to order as you waited. I enjoyed a massage in the hotels well appointed spa facility after breakfast & it was dreamy. The hotel is well located in a nice area only a few minutes walk from Topkapi Palace & other major attractions. The service from all of the staff was excellent, management are to be congratulated on their training.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in an amazing location, customer service just needs tweeking\u201d", "Author": "Where_2_Stay_M", "ReviewID": "UR118598138", "Content": "The levni is a beautiful new (1 year old) hotel on a quiet side street in the heart of Istanbul. My husband and I stayed there for 6 nights in the first week of September, on a special discounted rate for a standard room booked through bookings.com. It is modern and sleek with a touch of Turkey mixed in. We arrived at the hotel (via a shuttle bus from the airport for 10euros each) and checked in asap. Turkish delight supplied at front desk. Check in was fairly straightforward and relatively quick.Bahri at reception was extremely helpful- he gave us a map of the city and highlighted all the key attractions and the tram line of how to get to them. Ugur took our bags up to our room for us. The standard room was quite small with a double bed,flat screen on the wall, safe, bathrobes and slippers and a complimentary bottle of water. The bathroom had a lovely marble effect (as does 95% of the hotel), shampoo, conditioner, showr cap, soaps, creams and shower. However there was no door! I had read previous reviews of glass doors but this just took the biscuit lol After a quick phone call to Bahri the guest relations manager, UGur was back in our room taking our bags to our new room. Our new room was a lovely deluxe room hidden behind another set of doors eliminating any noise from the hallway. It had a seating area, king size bed, sculptured ceiling light, Turkish lamps and a bigger bathroom with a large bath tub and everything above as listed in the standard room. the bed was amazingly comfortable and although the door to the bathroom was glass it was frosted glass and not completely transparent. Using the hotel wifi I checked on bookings.com and this room was double what we paid for our standard room - so thanks to bahri! We then went on to explore the hotel and the city. To the left of the hotel is a grocery store where you can buy 6 x 1l bottles of water for 5lira and to the right there is a pharmacy and an electrical store where you can buy a travel adapter for 2 lira! At the end of the street(going left) there is a dominoes, mcdonalds and burger king all of which are halal and rates are much cheaper than in London. There are also many, many local Turkish kebab/kofte/donna restaurants where you can eat for as little as 5 lira. My personal favourite is alif bufe a family run cafe which is opposite and to the left of the levni. If you carry on walking (5minutes) you can straight past the galata bridge where you can take the bosphorus cruise for 12lira and into the spice bazar (10minute walk). From here you can also walk to the grand bazar and the suleiman mosque - which is a must see. Personally, I think it is actually better than the blue mosque as it has a peaceful aura about it. If you walk in the other direction of the levni (right direction) you come to the gulhane tram stop. You have to buy a token for 2lira and then you can take the tram (for literally 3minutes/ 2stops) to the blue mosque. From our experience of Istanbul it is extremely congested so if you was to take a car/taxi you would spend most of the day in traffic.We chose to walk to the blue mosque which you can do by either going up a steep hill or along the main normal level street which is dotted with souvenir shops, cafes, ice cream stands etc. We did both over the days and found the journey time from the hotel to be maximum 10-15 minutes walking even whilst stopping to take pictures. The blue mosque, haga Sophia church, topkapi palace, hippodrome and basilica cistern (all must see sights) are all in this region around sultanhmet square. So all in all the levni is in a fantastic location!! My only concern about the location is that the street is nor very well lit at night - but this isn't the hotels fault and actually the hotel is lit and can be seen down the road. Breakfast at the hotel is plentiful. (see pics) there is a variety of cheese an fruit, breads and cake, jams and cereals, eggs and omlettes. I did find the bread and cake were fresh and soft on the first morning and gradually became harder as the week progressed leading me to think it was the same since monday! during my 5 day stay they're were 2 chefs - one for the first 4 mornings and one for the final morning (they must work in shifts as all the waiters had also changed on the 5th day). The chef of the first 4 days is the only reason I would not give the levni a 5 star review. He was rude, did not engage in conversation (but did so with more affluent guests), and on two consecutive mornings said he would make omelettes and bring them over to our table - but instead left them to the side and we had to go collect them ourselves. The chef on the 5th morning was fantastic. He was dishing out food, chatting with guests and ordering all the waiters around. the hotel also has in it's basement a swimming pool (4x10m) -which we used everyday and only on one occasion were there other people in the pool too, a sauna, 2 Turkish baths (a big one for a group of people and an individual one), jacuzzi, gym, spa and acupuncture shower. Just like the rest of the hotel everything is beautifully decorated with scented oils and tea lights, the changing rooms have a shower, lockers, towels, hair dryer, hair gel an soaps. I did notice whilst using the pool other guests of the hotel were being given tours of these facilities and were also being told how to use them (sauna, Turkish bath). This was not something I had experienced so when I asked one of the staff leading the tours how to use the Turkish bath his reply was \"you just wash yourself with soap\". Hmm, if the facilities weren't so immaculate I would have been a bit insulted. All in all, the hotel is in a fantastic location, with fantastic facilities, rooms and decor. If it weren't for the 2 people I mentioned, customer service would also be 5 star but unfortunately thats what let them down.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenwich, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat boutique hotel in the heart of things\u201d", "Author": "Andreas663", "ReviewID": "UR118465177", "Content": "The Levni is a wonderful boutique hotel in the Sirkeci/Sultanamet area.

Proximity to the sights, modern, clean, quiet, a good bed, a good night sleep with the extras of an onsite Turkish bath- sounded like a safe bet for a 40th wedding anniversary and birthday treat. So the problem, pricey for what we got- which ended up being far below expectations for a 4 star. On the minor side, initial room was cramped with poor view. I thought they could do better for us especially since we had booked far in advance and were staying for 8 nights. After one night we got a room change- nicer with a peek of the Bosphorus over construction and expanses of run down roofs. Again minor glitches, no hooks in the bathroom for the robes which we slung over the doors when damp, shower leaked onto the floor requiring all our towels to soak up substantial water, few hangers, no dresser - clothes remained in suitcase. On the positive, comfortable bed, quiet, clean, nice breakfast with accommodating staff. So the problem- day 4 we returned at night hoping to relax in the Turkish bath/sauna, found our key card no longer worked and then after reprogramming the room had not been serviced, the bedspread and decorative pillows were gone, all our wet towels were on the floor and had not been replaced. The front desk sent replacement towels- too late to use the now closed Spa, told us they would identify and straighten out the problem, sent us a small bottle of wine- which we returned we're not drinkers- laughingly told us they would send up some water. Okay. We were ready to let this go. But for the next 3 nights the room was only partially made up- we never saw a bedspread or decorative pillows again, some days there were towels, somedays not. The air conditioner never worked. When I asked for an adjustment - we were paying close to $3000 for this booking- was told since our reservation was through Expedia the hotel would not be able to do anything for us. They eventually agreed to cover dinner without alcohol at a nice restaurant. Each of our last 4 nights we missed out on the Spa which closed by the time we got towels, robes or got into the room and talked with front desk. A few items we had bought in the market were missing. To make matters worse when we got home we contacted Expedia who said that they only act as a travel agent and they would have to contact the hotel for any adjustment- which they did and were apparently told nothing could be done because the hotel had no record of any problem!

The service at the hotel was very good; I personally would give 6 stars to the hotel just because of the special personalized service that we had pleasure to receive from the General Manager! He made our day twice! Having stayed in many hotels in my life, I can say that it is not often at all that General Manager himself bothers to interact with guests on this level. Definitely one of the best General Managers and a fantastic hotel! Guest Relations and Front Office is simply superb - many thanks to all stuff who made our stay so enjoyable and worry-free.

The hotel is a year old, quite labyrinthic, and has some correctly sized rooms and others that are quite small. No views whatsoever, traffic noise on the lower floors. We had three rooms for a week, in one of them the airco did not work, another did not have a minibar, a third had an airco that only blasted at full speed, directly at the bed, and no change of temperature possible (after getting a service person to the room three times without success, I gave up). The shower handles were loose and fell off, the bathroom scale was broken, the rug stained... Room was not made until late in the afternoon, on the 3rd day at 20.00 hrs only after we complained, on the 5th day when we came back at nearly midnight we found it was not made at all. The front desk was friendly but did not resolve anything. Breakfast is extensive but the bread is not up to standard and the fruit juices are horrendous.

Only \u00c2\u00bd block from Gulhane Tram Station. Short walk (although there are a lot of cobblestone streets and hills so wear comfortable shoes!!) to Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque, Aya Sofiya, Basilica Cistern. This hotel is fairly new so snatch it up now before everyone discovers it! Room was nice and they provide you with a robe and slippers during your stay. A little confusing getting to our room at first b/c its 2 separate buildings so you have to take 2 separate elevators to get to your room. Had a friend come to our hotel and she was waiting in one lobby while we were in the other. The room numbering system can be a little confusing ie room # 1301 is the 3rd floor and when u got to 3rd floor there were a short set of stairs to get to your room. Which is fine if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have luggage. Minibar in room which is nice to keep water cold. Free large bottled water was provided on 3 out of our 6 days there. Free wifi which you can access in your room also. Turkish delight at the lobby desk. Breakfast was excellent with made to order omelettes and pancakes. I thought the staff was very friendly and everyone tried to address your concerns and make you feel welcome. The manager was also very pleasant and helpful. Hotel Sultania- make a right out of hotel and then its one of the streets on the left but you will see the sign for the Caf\u00c3\u00a9. Offers free apple tea at the end of the meal Would recommend getting the jetons- tokens for the tram, bus, subway or if you can find where they sell it- the Akbil which multiple people can use and you can recharge it. Topkapi Palace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 20 lira I liked the treasury room with all the jewels!! They had an 86 karat diamond in there!!(Harem is inside the palace but charges a separate entrance to get in 15 lira- this was the living quarters of the sultans and concubines. Had nice tilework inside but not sure it was worth having a separate price of admission for) Grand Bazaar- do haggle them- they expect it. Some places take credit card (esp for larger purchases). Some take dollars and euros too. There are many places that sell pashminas so shop around for selection, quality and price. Jewelry is very nice here also. They are big into 22k gold and even if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get this at the grand bazaar in the jewelry district you can usu get 10-20% off what they quote you at some places. Bircan is a nice place and a pretty good selection (in Nuruosomaniye area). On the way to the Grand Bazaar you may pass this district of jewelry stores in Nuruosomaniye. Nar Gourmet Restaurant- located on the top floor of the Argamman jewelry store in Nuruosomaniye. Good food, warm bread and reasonable prices. Also along this same street is : Khave Desani- good for coffees and desserts. Good prices Worth a trip to the Asian side \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can get a ferry to the Asian side from Emononu. Ciya Sofrasi is a good place to start for the appetizers and Ciya Kebab right across the street for items with meat.

We would also like to thank Mr. Serkan for his time to chat with us between his duties as general manager on the hotel. We had a nice room, large enough for us three. However, the room is not practical for families with kids as the glass door on the bathroom did not provide the privacy needed and also was a danger to the kid. Constant slamming of the service personnell door next to our room was not nice to listen to, especially during the nap time for the kid. There were no view from the room, as we only could see the brick wall of restauration of next door building, but we have to admit, we did not come for the view from the room, but to have easy access to sights outside the room, so it did not matter to us at all, but for those who appreciate a room view should ask for room with view in this hotel. The location of the hotel is perfect, as it is walking distance to the Egyptian market, Spanish Market and the Grand basar with the spice market. It is also in walking distance to the 2 larger mosques in the old city and a great restaurant street only 10 minutes walking from the hotel. A tips to the hotel management (and not a critizism to the hotel): A warning should be given to all its guests by the reception personell at check-in that taxi should be ordered through the hotel in order to avoid being ripped off by the cab drivers. We experienced one greedy taxi driver which charged us double of the normal fare price, so we recommend asking for a taxi in the lobby at any given time. We certainly will make this our regular place to stay when we go to Istanbul every 3 months, and will highly recommend the place to anyone visiting Itanbul. We had a very nice time at the hotel, and enjoyed the food in the restaurant and at breakfast. Our kid had a lovely time as he got spoiled by the personnell and could enjoy a daily swim in a nice atmosphere and intimate swimming pool area in the basement. Extra cot bed was provided by the staff upon arrival, and the kid slept like an angel during the night.

We are a young professional couple who have travelled around the world and have stayed at various 5 star hotels. The hotel website is good and quite accurate. The location is good, although there were a lot of roadworks in the area (not the hotel's fault). This hotel is sleek and looks impeccable, lots of marble everywhere. The rooms are lovely - very nicely done and all the comforts are there. However, we arrived at 1400, quite tired, and had to wait a further 1.5 hours for our room which had not yet been cleaned. We did not complain (but had to ask whether our room was ready several times) and later that evening, the hotel, unprompted, sent us wine and fruit to our room as an apology. I do believe that the staff are friendly and very helpful, and would go out of their way to help. However, in situations like this, perhaps offering tea and a wider spread of biscuits (than the single biscuit which we got) would have sufficed as we were very hungry when we arrived and strong Turkish tea is not necessarily good on an empty stomach! Breakfast was fine, a buffet with a fairly wide spread. I do however agree with one reviewer who commented that the wait staff appeared disorganised. The hotel was not full when we stayed and from their slowness in responding to requests, I dont think that the staff would be able to cope with busy periods. Glad to see that this hotel is getting good reviews, it deserves it. For prospective guests, I would suggest being wary of reviews which claim false advertising (yes, you 'BeSafe2011' from San Francisco) and accusations of unsafe rooms. The hotel's answer is interesting, and having experienced the hotel, believe their response. Litigous American culture has a lot to answer for, and be ashamed of.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cLike a magic!!\u201d", "Author": "antoniosurv", "ReviewID": "UR107698736", "Content": "The location of the hotel is really convenient.

I chose this hotel because of all the positive reviews I read on Trip Advisor however I must say I have mixed feelings about our experience. I'll start with the positives: the location of the hotel is fantastic; the hotel is clean, new and modern with nice decor; there's a spa centre where you have free access to the sauna, pool and gym (treatments/massages are extra but at a reasonable price); our transfers to and from the airport were organised and on time; staff at the front desk reception are helpful, made recommendations, booked restaurants, tours etc., the breakfast is good with cold and warm options. On the negative side: - our room was really small, it looked out onto a wall, the 'bathroom' was separated from the bed by a sliding mirror and the toilet was in a tiny cubicle, it wasn't an ugly looking room because as I said the decor is nice and they did the best with the space available, but having paid Eur 200 a night I expected a bit better; - the spa is one of the strong points of the hotel, we had a massage on one day and enjoyed it, so there and then, we asked the lady at the spa reception desk to book us another hamman treatment for our last evening. We were looking forward to it and when we arrive there they said they couldn't find our reservation and so we didn't get our treatment. Never understood what went wrong. However both ladies who we spoke to at the spa reception desk (on different days) could barely communicate in English or explain what the treatments on offer consist of, so I think the problem may lie there. - the staff in the breakfast room need to be more organised, I don't know if it's a matter of being understaffed but I think it's more a matter of being managed better, on one of the days we waited 15 minutes seated at a dirty table (all available tables were dirty) before one of the them cleared the dirty plates, and on all days you got your coffee when you had almost finished your bfast. - other visitors mentioned that the hotel made excellent recommendations for restaurants. Well basically they have 4 or 5 brochures for different restos which include a free transfer to and from the resto. We went to the Balik Restaurant under the Galata Bridge and had a mediocre meal for over Eur 200 for 2 ppl. The other nights we followed lonely planet recommendations and had excellent meals. I don't want to be negative, I thought I would write also about the negative aspects of our experience to avoid others having as high expectations as we had and then being disappointed. Maybe we were just unlucky.
