Moreover, our room on the Mark Newsome floor, provided a welcome respite from our daily travels throughout the beautiful city of Madrid. For this American, who has been dependent on an automobile for my entire adult life, the simplicity and timeliness of the Madrid Metro made this trip a truly extraordinary experience. I eagerly anticipated my daily walk to the conveniently located Cartagena Metro station. After just one stop, you had access to three other lines at the Avenida de America station. From there, it is mere minutes to every significant neighborhood in Madrid. I only wish that my home Subway, the great New York system, was operated as efficiently as the Madrid Metro.

We were there for a meeting, so the location was bearable, and it's about a 20 min walk or short cab ride to Calle Serrano, which has some great restaurants and shopping. I didn't like the rooms in this hotel at all. Over a 3-week period, I stayed in rooms on the 8th, 9th and 10th floors. Overall what annoys me about this hotel is that design trumps practicality. A common theme of rooms on all three floors I tried: very little space to store clothes. Yeah I had a lot for a 3-week trip, but I can't imagine sharing the space with another person even when packing more lightly. The 10th floor is almost all black -- even if this doesn't depress you, the shower will, as it's designed so that water will spray all over the bathroom floor. Also unless you reach the shower through the bathtub, you'll get blasted with cold water when turning the water on. The 9th floor was the \"best\" of the ones I stayed on. The only annoying impracticality was the bathroom faucet had only a temperature control. So the water was either off or on full blast, which I think would be annoying if sharing the room and using the bathroom in the middle of the night. The 8th floor is all white and arguably the least practically designed of all. There's a dearth of towel racks, so to have a towel nearby the centrally located bathtub/shower, you need to rest the towel on the cramped sink area. The bath/shower itself is a disaster, as the design guarantees that with the slightest draft, the shower curtain will envelop your body -- all I could think about what how nasty this must be, with all the previous guests. The worst though is that whatever materials were used to build this floor, they amplify sound to the point that you can hear EVERYTHING from the hallway. The first night I literally thought I forgot to close my door, the sounds were so clear. Except for the 10th floor, the other rooms I stayed in had very minimal desk space, so forget about really working in your room. While wireless is free at this hotel, it's also very slow and unreliable. In my room on the 9th floor, it barely worked at all. The worst though is that every time you log in, a username and password must be entered. And it's a ridiculous password, like \"9DdfX4ga\", which is fun to type on a smartphone. Then there's the annoyance of having this log in only valid for three days, after which you have to remember to ask the front desk for another code. Special damnation is reserved for the gym. This is easily the worst gym I've ever experienced in my life. Why even bother having one? Once again design trumps practicality, as it's all black and almost completely dark, with glass walls. The first time there I was paranoid about walking into a wall as my eyes were adjusting to the light. I understand in Europe gyms are small and less highly prized, but there's no need to make a gym look like a nightclub. Also the temperature control didn't seem to work, so in combination from the humidity (and chlorine scent from the adjacent pool), I almost felt like collapsing after 30 minutes on the elliptical, despite being in decent shape. The service at the hotel is average and the sandwiches in the lobby bar are good for a quick dinner. Overall though, the impractical design of this hotel is a huge turnoff for me. Maybe for a quick weekend trip this is ok, but for three weeks it's uncomfortable to say the least.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cLandmark design hotel, welcoming and modern\u201d", "Author": "Alex S", "ReviewID": "UR126201530", "Content": "The Silken Puerta America is a superbly designed, welcoming hotel.

We picked on room, cant recall which floor, possibly the 5th or 7th and when we got to the room, it was quite rundown with shabby ceilings covered in dirt and the room was not so great, it was a surprise how poor it was actually. My wife had booked the place for my 30th so she wanted it to be special. So we went down and enquired about a different room. This girl at reception was much friendlier and we got a room on 11th floor I think that was much much better. It was really nice room and big comfy bed as well as curtains to block out all light for sleeping on in the morning. The bath was huge, the whole room was excellent, really was.

It sounded very cool and worth a visit on its own. (Assuming it lived up to the hype.) One potential negative was that it was away from the city center. For the most part we didn't find this a huge problem, although we did have trouble finding available late night food in the neighborhood close to the hotel. Also, when you're tired from traipsing around the city all day, sometimes you wish your hotel was a bit closer to get back to. Exploring each floor was an experience in and of itself. The designs of some of them are amazing. Even the design of the elevators, with most of it being glass, affording a grand view, is amazing. We picked the stark white Kathyrn Findlay designed room, which costed extra money. I guess it's in high demand. I did notice that, due to the design, some cracking in the plaster and what not. I suppose with such a build, it might be hard to keep it maintained. But the room was generally comfortable and interesting. The queen/king sized bed was comfortable, especially consider our other Spain hotels had the usual two twin beds put together.

Our first impression was very good as reception staff were outstanding. Very welcoming and professional. We frankly did not know what to expect because communication via email prior and during the booking process was less than attentive. The face to face experience was a very pleasant surprise. Zaha Hadid's white room is built in fibreglass like material, in one piece. The only movable piece of furniture is a chair. We found this to be unique and we enjoyed the design, I reckon it is not for everybody, but then again there is a number of rooms for you to choose from. The bathtub was a big hit for us. My husband is 6' 7\" (1.98 cm) and although we aren't overweight, it's never easy for us to soak together after a full day sightseeing. I had objected to staying in this hotel, because the weather was very hot and I wished to stay somewhere with an outdoors swimming pool. Silken Puerta America has a very small indoor swimming pool, which we did not visit. The room was clean. If I was to fault something, it would be the carpet. Carpets are favoured by hotels but let's face it, they are unhygienic, and not matter what you do to it, you can never clean it like you clean a hard floor. Further to this, giving the illusion that a white carpet is clean is even more difficult than doing so with a coloured one, but then again, if keeping the carpet seemingly clean is not possible, perhaps it should be replaced for a different type of flooring. Other than this, we greatly enjoyed having complementary soft drinks and Molton Brown toiletries. The offer we booked included a bottle of wine and fine chocolate. We were given the bottle of wine and fine chocolate. It was only two truffles, but then again, I don't care for chocolate. We were offered newspapers, but they never materialised. There was only two pillows in the room and when I requested two more these were brought up immediately. The person who took the call was beautifully mannered. We were concerned that the room might be noisy, but this was not the case at all. We slept soundly and weren't disturbed at all. The location is what it is and you see this reflected in the discounted fares. We did not mind the short underground ride from the town centre. Bottom line: If you are looking for the kind of overly fussy service you get at the Ritz, go to the Ritz.

We stayed on the first floor, designed by Zaha Hadid. The room was very much what you see in the pics...white and space-ship like! The bed was a bit hard, but comfortable. The staff were friendly upon check-in, although we did wait quite a while to check in as people before us made their room selections on the iPad. We accepted the challenge to see and photograph each floor, and it was a lovely expedition, awaiting the surprise as the elevator opened on each floor. The toiletries in the Zaha Hadid room were by Molten Brown, although I am sure that there were good products on the non-club floors as well. We did not have breakfast, as it was extortionately expensive. We chose to rather visit the little 'croissanterie' just 2 streets behind the hotel where we bought delicious toasted croissants, churros and cafe con leches...for 2 people cost us 6 Euro! My only complaint about the Zaha Hadid floor would be that the door to the corridor is not very sound-proofed, and you can hear practically everything thats going on outside. In contrast, there is a busy freeway right in front of the hotel that you cannot hear at all, as the front windows are nicely soundproofed. I mentioned this problem to reception upon checkout. The minibar in the club room was free (non alcoholic drinks only), and we were never short of any drinks. The minibar was replenished daily. I thought this was a nice touch! Fluffy bathrobes and slippers are provided in the room. The location IS indeed very close to the Cartegena metro stop (as people have mentioned here before), and you can even walk to and from the Avenida de America stop (the bus 200 from the airport stops at this stop). However, we felt the metro was not as convenient as we would have liked. With barely any restaurants/activities near the hotel, we had to make several trips per day to and from Madrid centre. The Cartegena metro stop does not connect easily with the other popular lines, so we found that several line changes were necessary to get to where we wanted to go. This can be annoying after a long day of sightseeing, especially as the change in connection is often long walks and escalators inside the metro station. Due to this reason, I would say the hotel is not very convenient in terms of location. On the other hand, if you are looking for a quality stay, and a spotlessly clean and luxurious hotel, and you are prepared to travel to the city only once a day (or by taxi, or you dont mind walking alot) then Puerta Silken America is for you.

Read all the reviews which really helped in making our decision to come here, which let me make clear WAS NOT a regrettable one :) Each floor is designed differently! I know a lot of the rooms were quite open plan or 'tasteful'. If privacy is an issue for you then choose the 6th floor which is where we stayed, bathroom separate compared to some other rooms. You do get to choose your room upon arrival though so you can decide then. The room was very spacious and clean, the bathroom was great with a separate bath and shower, the pressure of which was good.There is also storage space which consists of chest of drawers and a wardrobe for those of you who dont like to live out of your suitcase! The only little thing i would mention that i was quite disappointed about was the no access to the balcony but there were windows and an air conditioning system so after that it never became a problem! Room service was also good and relatively quick. the spa facilities are ok, there is a gym, sauna and swimming pool all located on the top floor but quite small. Along with the spa and gym, there is also a night bar called 'sky night bar' which is great with some fantastic views :) Another bar is located downstairs which is good, staff were very friendly though prices were just a little more than reasonable however not compared to the restaurant opposite which we found rather expensive! At basement level there is a breakfast buffet which i have to say was amazing! Great range of fresh food, but also quite expensive at 27 euros for one person for one day. In case anyone is wondering internet access for us was not free but very cheap, not sure if the hotel has any other facilities such as free wifi or conference rooms to address this. The area of the hotel is good, its location is right next to a metro station which allows you to get around madrid and around 25 minutes from the airport by bus which is much cheaper than a taxi! Past the local metro station there are restaurants and shops you can go to and further down is the bus station all within 10 minutes walk of the hotel. Although the hotel isnt quite close to downtown, the metro is within reach and allows you to get to the heart of madrid within 20-30 minutes. Overall the stay was great!

It was designed by 14 diferent architects, each given pretty the flexibility to do whatever he/she wanted. Eventough location is not good for a torist traveler, we decided to overview this fact and reserve. We liked so much the different rooms, we decided to make 3 consecutive reservations of 1 night each, specifying we wanted non-smoking rooms (three of their floors are smoking floors and smell like it). We specicaly paid about $50 more to get a suite the second night to assure we got different rooms. First time in our lives we do that but we thought the hotel worth the sacrifice. The rooms are out of this world! Really. That much was good. Hallways in each floor are equally amazing! If you can deal with lousy service you should try the place. The lobby is laim. Nowhere up to par with the upper floors. Breakfast is really good and price is a little high (about $45 per person). Then the service. 2 people checking in 10 guests and they took about 8 minutes per guest. We waited in line half an hour for the initial check-in. About 15 minute wait for the 2 subsequent stays. The second night was the suite. At the reception they simply said we did not have a suite. We showed the reservation paying a higher rate and showing the suite election. The receptionist disregarded this and said this must have been a mistake with Expedia. We never got any money back and they gave us a standard room. We chose a room that was pretty dark. It was nice but with black walls, ceiling and floor, the next day we realized some inconveniences could arise. When we packed to move to the third room we left our passports (blue covers) and didn't notice. Checking out of our final night and preparing to return to Miami, we could not find our passports. We were certain these were in the second room and called the reception. They said they would check immediately. After 20 minutes we called back and they said they checked and did not find anything. We asked them to look again and said in was to early to knock on the door to a guest (11 a.m.) and they would have to wait until later. We explained our international flight left in two hours. They couldn't care less. It wasn't a shirt we left. It was our passports! Frustrated we decided to go to the Airport to try to move our flight one day at least with the over cost and complications. Once in the elevator we decided to stop at the room and knock ourselves. Nobody opened. Then the housekeeper of the floor shows up and tell us she never looked and as a matter of fact, she saw that guest leave the room early in the morning!! Now we are really upset. It is probalby too late to catch our flight anyways. The lady was very nice once she realized the situation, walked in and came back with one passport! Great but we are missing the second one. The second had fallen between the table and the bed and on a second search she found it. My wife, who would get in BIG trouble at work if she didn't showed up, hugged her and gave her a kiss.... and a tip. We ran down to check out to find the same slow arrogant service and several guests and from the back told with joy and frustration both receptionists we had found our passports. At the begining they didn't even knew what we were talking about. Then one said, oh yes, that. And shekept doing her thing like nothing happened. All people in line realized the urgency of the situation, as oppossed to the employee's who lied to us about looking for the passports and did not even react.

Wonderful hotel. Read that some people have found it too far out from the centre, which didn\u2019t cause us any problems \u2013 on arrival at Madrid airport, get the metro down to Cantigna stop, the hotel is about 100 metres from here. A 3 day metro pass to include all transport is around 13euros, very cheap, and it takes about 20 minutes with the various stops into the centre this way. There is a taxi rank right outside too, and a trip into the city this way is around 7 euros, journey time about 5 minutes depending on day and time. On first sight, the hotel is fantastic, the exterior is superb and the inside a breath of fresh air. On arrival you receive an ipad to choose which room you want, which is very novel and a great way to start the stay. The room was wonderful, with a great view from the rear of the hotel of the 4 towers at the far end of the city. Our bed faced the window and this wonderful view, and everything in the room was clean, fresh, tidy and well maintained. You can stop off at all the floors and have a wander round the different designs. On top of that, on our arrival we were greeted with a bottle of champagne and chocolates to celebrate our anniversary, which was a wonderful touch and highly appreciated. We managed to use the small pool on the top floor a couple of times and found this a lovely tranquil place after a hard day of sight-seeing. We were a bit worried about the price of food and drink before arriving, unfortunately some of this was a bit outside our price range -the nightclub (which is worth a visit for the panoramic view alone, though 2 drinks cost 25 euros!!), the ground floor bar was reasonably priced (11euros for 2 large wines) and a great way to start the evening before going for a meal. We didn\u2019t eat an evening meal in one of the hotel restaurants, but our stay did include breakfast (which we pre booked by the tour operator, which worked out at under half the daily price than if we had booked on arrival) \u2013 and this is superb. I cannot emphasise enough the quality of the buffet breakfast \u2013 everything you could want and more, it really set us up for the days sightseeing. Well worth the money, as I say if you book it as part of your stay and if it works out reasonable for your budget. You save the money on having to have lunch anyway! The minbar was very over-priced, yet next to the metro stop down the road is a Carrefour minimart, which is very cheap (6 bottles of estrella for 2.20 euros or bottle of good quality champagne or wine for 4 euros, compared to 35 euros for the minibar red wine (one glass size!), so make sure you stock up here for supplies\u2026. I cannot recommend the hotel enough, never stayed somewhere like this before, just the quality of the stay, the way you are treated (all staff were excellent) and the luxurious surroundings. If you are a couple like us, whom have to save a few months to afford a weekend away, then it is well worth the saving \u2013 it is a little pricy, but if you get a good deal (we paid 400 euros for 3 nights including breakfast, the usual price according to their tariff book in the room is around 750-800 euros per night, breakfast 25 euros each), then it is more than worth it. Also a last tip \u2013 if you don\u2019t fancy a trek into the centre, turn right out of the hotel entrance, walk 100m past the metro and carry on for around another 50m, the Italian pizzeria on the corner, La Tagliatella (or something like that) \u2013 amazing and well worth the trip. All in all, check it out.

The hotel is not right in the centre, but you have two train (metro) stations within a couple of mins walk. For breakfast, I would highly recommend a small, local bakery which is a block away (2m walk) if you come out of the front of the hotel, go right and 1st right again - then walk straight down the connecting road and its directly infront of you. Breakfast for 2 here costs 10-12 Euros max here, with the hotel charging an extortionate 25 Euros for one full English breakfast. The bar at the top of the hotel is worth a visit on fri/sat and is full of the jet set, but again is expensive. The pool is disappointing as its small, dark and indoors which is a shame. Use the iPad at reception to choose your own floor, which is very cool, as the hotel staff try to allocate you a room. To reach the hotel take the 200 bus from the airport \u2013 costs 1.50 each, and takes 20mins max, with the hotel quoting 82 Euros for a one way trip in a taxi.

Arriving at the Hotel I found the staff to be extremely helpfull and friendly. At this point you can use a screen at reception to choose your room if you have not prebooked. All the rooms on each floor are identical with a diferent designers idea for each floor, all of which are interesting, if somewhat strange at times. It imakes a change to find the the hotel has 3 floors of smoking rooms (I do not smoke) which are of an excellent standard. I really liked the look of the rooms on one of these floors so I stayed in one and could not tell tell the difference. It was clean and had no smell or signs of tobacco. It was also modern, roomy with a very good selection of toiletries etc., a well stocked mini bar, free wifi. and multi channel TV The thirteenth floor is home to three things; a really modern night bar, which catered to all ages and didn't overley charge for the drinks and was well attended by a cross miix of ages. a small fitness centre with modern equipment, a sauna/Turkish bath and a closed in swimming pool. The latter was narrow and long, great for exercise but not for games though interesting to see how many lengths you can do underwater without coming up for air (2.5 honest!) The third thing was a glass floor walkway round the outside of the lift, a very unerving experience but certainly different and worth braving to photograph your feet so far above ground. I did not avail myself of any of the various restaurants (although I am sure they would have been of a standard to match the quality of the hotel) because I believe hat Madrid is home to some of the best restaurants anywhere in Europe, for both quality and value, and this visit reconfirmed my faith.

He could not find my booking and was very patronising and after a few reluctant phone calls my booking was found. Not one apology from him. Bad start to the stay, even more it was my birthday and this stress was very unecessary. On finding the booking he decided that he would chose the room for us, rather than letting us have a look ourselves first, however I insisted that he let us look ourselves at the rooms on the Ipad and again he was very stroppy saying that most of the rooms wouldn't accomodate the baby cot. The room we did choose (10th floor), he was adamant the cot wouldn't fit and rang to check, they said it would, so we got the room WE wanted. When we got to the room it was obvious it could have accomodated 3 of the travel cots! The rest of the staff perfect. Everything else overpriced but glad I stayed as I have wanted to stay in this hotel for years and the SOS summer deal we got was worth it. The baths on the 10th floor are fab but took about 40 mins to fill, and ironically there is a sign next to it saying 'Madrid needs water'! We ate out at an Argentine restaurant not far from the hotel and was delicious. Another tip, if you dont want to pay the extortion they charge for drinks/minibar, there's a Carrefour round the corner, get some beers there and stash them in the minibar to keep cool ;) A lot of people have been whingeing about the pool/gym, no it's not big and yes it's dark and unsual but boy I was glad for a swim after a day in the Madrid August heat!

You're not in the middle of Madrid - but you're not far away - and you get to see a different neighbourhood which is always a good thing, right?

When you arrive in the lobby, it is quite unassuming but this soon changes as you enter the corridor to your room, all of which are different. We stayed on the White floor. I think it's the 1st floor. We had the choice between a White and a black one and both couples chose the White one which is very futuristic and mad, in a good way. The bath/shower in this type of room wouldn't be good for those with limited mobility though so that's something to ask about for other floors, which, as I said, are all styled completely differently anyway. You can go and have a look at all the other corridors and there is a guided tour of all the floors too, which unfortunately we didnt get a chance to go on as it's in the afternoon but I'd say it's definitely worth a look at if you're around. There's a glass/see through platform on the top floor of the hotel too so head up and walk on it! If I was to fault anything, I would say the restaurant seemed very expensive.

It is only one block from a metro stop. The rooms are very modern, clean and are quite large. The bathrooms are also large and the shower is very nice and roomy. The rooms are quiet (meaning you can't hear noise in the room from other rooms or from the hallway). When you check in they give you a couple of options for room designs to pick from. There is a Carrefour near the metro stop where you can by cheap water, snacks. It looks like they had a very fancy restaurant, bar and club at this hotel. We didn't try these...but they seemed trendy and popular. Be aware that you only share a room with someone you are close to. In the particular room design we had, one whole side of the bathroom was just a glass window/door. You could see everything going on in the bathroom. Infact, the only mirror in the room was facing this \"open\" side of the bathroom. So if one person wanted to use the mirror in the room they could see everything the other person was doing in the bathroom. Also, the bathroom is not sound proof at all. Another problem, the first day and the last day we were there we couldn't turn on the light in the bathroom. There were way to many switches in the room. The only complaint I have is that one night we called them to ask for more shaving cream. The lady said she was going to send it up right away to our room. We waited all night (didn't leave the room at all) and no one ever came up with the shaving cream. I would much rather they say \"no\" then lie. Overall, I recommend this hotel.

The room was quiet at night and had an effective black-out curtain. Everything was clean and well-presented. There was free internet access, which was brilliant.

That was the first small disappointment for me \u2013 being unable to book a room on a floor before the day of my stay. Surely the hotel could have a booking system that allows the specification of a particular floor, especially since they make such a song and dance about how each one is so individual? I had a look at each of the lobbies on all 13 floors and have to say they were all stunning. 8th and the 4th (the one that\u2019s like a metal labyrinth) were my favourites. Made for some great photos. I was overwhelmed by the aesthetic of the room when I first entered \u2013 a truly amazing look. After a day or two though I started to notice the odd annoying thing. For example the bath is dangerous. This may sound silly, but the floor of the bath is bevelled and there are no walls higher than shin height, so anyone who likes something to lean on whilst getting in and out of the shower may be on slightly shaky ground here. Another few minor gripes: the fridge is tiny, the aircon is pretty noisy and don\u2019t expect to get a good long sleep in the morning as the doors are very thin and you can hear everything on the hard floored corridors outside \u2013 especially the chatty/shouty staff. Also something that really annoyed me was the lifts \u2013 I\u2019m a smoker so had to use them pretty frequently (no smoking at all in the hotel) and having to swipe my room card every time I pressed the button started to get annoying \u2013 especially as it sometime took 3 attempts. I\u2019m not sure how well this system would work in an emergency. Also, the location was a bit of a chore. It is very close to a metro, but anywhere you want to go will be at least 2 changes away. At first it doesn\u2019t seem to make much difference, but soon I found myself wishing for the location of my previous hotel in the Sol area. Oh and the bar is extortionate \u2013 think I paid around 9 euro for a beer \u2013 they really seem to exploit their captive audience. My main annoyance though was the internet access. For such a stylish and modern hotel I would have expected a good wi-fi service (which is advertised). But alas it wasn\u2019t. We could only connect ONE DEVICE. I hooked up the laptop but when I tried to connect with the iphone I was told that I was exceeding my quota. I could live with that, but even on the laptop the speeds were super slow. I\u2019m talking 56k modem speeds. The internet without broadband it seemed. I mentioned this to reception and they gave me an Ethernet cable (charging for the privilege) and guess what? The holes that were supposed to hold the ports in my room were just holes. A member of staff had to come up and take apart the bed and pull wires from the console to get access to the ports. As I type this review there are cables on display and the facade has bits ripped off. So yes \u2013 a truly beautiful hotel. But spending a bit of time on functional aspects in addition to the unique design would have helped. I notice the standard rates are around 800-1200 euro per night (we paid 120 through a secondary site) \u2013 definitely not worth that. Probably worth the 120 though, at least for a couple of nights.

The fare from Madrid airport to the hotel was 25 Euros. The hotel itself is well situated for Madrid - there is a shopping mall just a few minutes walk away. The hotel itself is a tower block with interesting neon lighting down the side of it - more on that later! There is a taxi rank directly outside it, so transport was never a problem. Checkin was excellent - cheerful and friendly staff, who spoke excellent English. They were able to answer all my questions, and were extremely helpful - when I needed to print off my boarding pass for my return flight, they did it then and there. WELL DONE! This is very much a designer or boutique hotel - the owners have let the designer be very creative with a 2001 science fiction theme. When I got out of the lift on the 8th floor, it was stepping into an episode of UFO, or on to the set of 2001: A Space Odyessy. There was a strange looking sofa outside the lift but! it had a sign on it saying \"please do not sit on this.\" As with so many things with this hotel, it *looks* good, but isn't really practical. The corridors to the rooms follow the same space age design - white, with curved walls - and the doors to the rooms are like airlocks, where you have to out your key to a sensor to open it. The corridors were not very well lit, and to be honest I found them quite eerie. The room itself was very unusual - EVERYTHING was white! Walls, bed, net curtains, chairs... you name it! The layout was very odd - a double bed was bang in the middle of the room, facing the window, so you had to walk round it. There was a very thin work bench with a single chair - this looked good, but was too narrow for any meaningful work to be done on it. Internet access was free - WELL DONE! The bath was right next to the bed (!) and shielded off by a couple of layers of white shower curtains drawn round it. It was an odd shape too - like a large flowerpot, with a shower at one end. Despite its appearances, this did work very well, although water did run easily from it into the rest of the room. The toilet was sealed off by a glass door, although I was slightly bemused at the presence of a phone in there. I ordered room service, which was quickly delivered, and good quality food - WELL DONE! Now on to the bad things. EVERYTHING in the room was white - that means that scuffs and dirt showed up really clearly. There was a storage area (behind another white shower curtain) which was quite badly scuffed and marked - NOT GOOD. The mechanism for using the lights was not clearly outlined - for the first 5 minutes, the lights kept switching off, and I had to run back to the sensor to get them back on. Eventually I managed to lean my room card against it, and that kept them on - NOT GOOD. The bed was very hard, and I didn't enjoy sleeping on it - NOT GOOD. The TV was mounted in the ceiling and lowered via buttons - very dramatic - but the position of it wasn't great - if you wanted to watch TV in bed there was no headrest to give you any support, so you got a crick in your neck. NOT GOOD. The worst part of the room was that it had NO CURTAINS - just thick (white) net sheeting at the window. This meant that when you switched the lights off to go to sleep, any light from outside came straight into the room - and because all the surfaces are white, the light was bounced right round the room. Just to make things worse, my room was directly next to the neon lighting on the outside of the hotel, so my entire room was bathed in a strange amber glow that was bright enough for me read by! I did NOT sleep well - NOT GOOD! Breakfast the next morning was good - an excellent choice of food, and good service. I travel a lot with business and whilst it is very stylish, I simply couldn't recommend it for a business traveler due to the issues with the room layout, lighting and lack of sleep quality.

Arad's room has the most creative and unusual layout ever as all furniture and utilities are designed as A PIECE being placed in the middle of the room but it is surprisingly practical and comfortable. The round-shaped bed is huge and the remote-controlled projection screen turns the room into some sort of funky home-theater-like space. Intelligent/Smart system embedded. Huge bathtub and nice shower. The design itself is the joy of living in this room. I almost kill myself in Plasma Studio's room because of all the sharp edges even though I have to admit Plasma Studio has provided the most visually stimulating design for the hotel but it is best to keep it as installation. Whereby Hadid's room is again another installation-like space and you just need to watch out every move within the room. *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: (even you are not staying in this hotel) Dine in the Michelin-starred restaurant on ground level, MUST NOT MISS the Cochinillo Asado (Roast Suckling Pig) here!

Nothing was well fitted (surely a must with a very minimalist look?) and the chips, stains, cracked glass, etc made it feel poorly maintained.

You can catch the 200 bus from the airport which is 2 euros (turn right when you leave the airport and walk hundred metres along the concourse). Of course, if youre spending this much on a hotel then you'd probably get a cab which cost us 25 euros one way. The hotel facilities are NOT functional but again are installed for style. The pool is not for swimming in but looks great and in the summer is open air. Its more of a plunge pool but it was never designed to accomodate screaming kids and blow up whales. The bar is expensive but offers good cocktails and great views of the city. The Metro is cheap and easy to work out and gets you to all the main tourist destinations quickly.

However, I ended up being pretty disappointed and can think of few good things to say about the hotel. The hotel is not in a good location and there's nothing to do in the vicinity. However, the metro system is pretty efficient and we thought the other features of the hotel would make up for this. We were wrong. Obviously the main point of the hotel is to experience the impressive rooms so we looked through the room 'menu' and chose some exciting rooms. Unfortunately, we were told if we wanted to stay in the rooms we chose we would have to pay a supplement. Perhaps this is my fault for not checking the website properly but it was certainly not clear at the time of booking (we booked through lastminute). Anyway, rather than pay even more, we settled for a room on the 6th floor which did not carry an additional charge. Other than the fact that the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom could be removed, the room was nothing special. For our second night, we asked if we could move rooms. Again the main point of this hotel is to experience the rooms, so we wanted experience more than one. Guess what though... 60 Euro supplement, just to change rooms. And then it would be even more if we wanted one of the rooms with additional charges. I thought this was pretty poor. The hotel is not cheap, as it is, and they are still trying to add charges, wherever they can. Some other points to note: The pool is tiny, dark and cold. There is nowhere to change and nowhere to store belongings while you are in the gym/ pool. This facility is just for show as I can't see anyone using it. The entrance to the hotel is not clear and does not make it seem inviting. Finally, most of the staff were pretty cold and unhelpful. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone unless they are willing to pay a lot of money to stay in a variety of rooms. Even then I don't know if it would be worth it as I didn't get to see those other rooms. Don't stay in this pretentious hotel.

After a 27\u20ac cab ride from the airport, we were first booked into a Norman Foster room which was very nice - all glass and marble, but 2nd floor at the back so a disappointing view. It also only had a shower and we prefer a bath, so we asked to move and they were very accommodating, putting us on the 6th floor in a Marc Newson room. This was full of high gloss surfaces, grey leather and wood, with a nice big bathtub and a wall that folded away so you could make the bath become part of the bedroom. The public areas on each floor were also impressive, particularly the Zaha Hadid. (There is apparently a tour of the hotel that we would have liked to take, but no one told us about it.) However this is where it ended as far as a good impression goes and for the following reasons I would not recommend the hotel and would not return. My husband and I are in our fifties but perfectly presentable, neither badly dressed nor hideous and our kids allow us out. However there was a distinct air of scorn from the painfully fashionable, younger staff and other clients (not necessarily residents) when we dared to set foot in the bar and pool areas. The rooftop bar is hugely expensive. For 30\u20ac a cocktail I would expect them to know how to make a dry martini. My husband had to go and show them after we had waited half an hour and then they arrived completely wrong. (We were erroneously charged for mineral water and champagne, however, after complaining at check out, these drinks as well as the doomed martinis, were removed from our bill.) If you don't manage to bag a sought-after tall stool next to the window with the sky view, you are relegated to sagging pouffes which are roughly 1 foot from the ground. You can therefore see nothing but the knees of the gorgeous, but surly, waitresses as they flounce by and you should allow a good five minutes to be able to get up again. The walls and ceiling are of flapping plastic so the feeling is one of being in a very noisy marquee at a wedding at which no one is speaking to you. The music is unrelentingly deafening Europop - rather than sultry & atmospheric Buddha Bar. We had a very nice dinner in the smaller restaurant, as the \"gourmet\" one was closed on Sunday nights, that menu being very interesting, but also hugely expensive. We ate foie gras, mushroom risotto, tuna tartare and a perfect little hamburger, followed by balsamic-marinated strawberries with cheese ice-cream. It was delicious. The rooftop floor also houses the pool, which, on first visit is very confusing. You exit the lift , thinking, as in a bad dream, that you have just walked into the bar in your bathrobe. However, a girl whose job it is to usher confused guests into the spa, rushes out from her post to usher confused guests into the spa. This also causes much smirking and derision from all supercilious onlookers. The pool is dark and somewhat gloomy with only 4 beds around it. The steam room and showers are nice. The weather was gorgeous and a rooftop terrace or balcony would make this area much more appealing. In fact, having come from an exhausting day in Madrid one afternoon and just wishing to relax in the sun for a while, we were reduced to lying on the grass verge alongside the 3 lane highway outside the hotel, surrounded by dog mess! We have just returned from a 5* resort in Mauritius and I know that, had they seen 2 guests wandering around obviously looking for somewhere to sunbathe, they would have run out proffering sun beds and drinks. The staff here just stood and looked bemused. The lift is programmed not to stop at guest rooms at certain times to accommodate the non-resident bar customers, who all come to spend their free drink tokens. This information is kept a mystery to guests however, who can regularly be witnessed frantically waving their room key in front of the light in an attempt to exit the lift at their floor. Sadly all to no avail. This, of course, causes further amusement and is probably put in place to enhance the evening of, the aforesaid stylista clientele. The location is half way between the airport and the centre of Madrid. It is not a particularly appealing area. When we first checked in, the hotel lift was full of local kids joy riding. This did not say much for the security - who were probably too preoccupied with their reflection in the glass doors to notice. There is a Metro 5 minutes walk away and the train system is very efficient and cheap. However it does become wearing when you are out all day and then return for a bath and to get dressed up for dinner, knowing that you have to face the journey twice more that evening. I would recommend very comfortable shoes. The Metro to the airport is 2\u20ac per person and easy. We did have a great time - Madrid is wonderful - and a sense of humour as well as reasonably robust self images saw us through at the hotel. I get the feeling that if you wish to go and experience it for yourselves, you should make it reasonably soon.

Be careful of pregnant ladies decoying for pickpockets though. The cab from the Airport is 25 Euros, others who stayed in and around Sol paid 35 Euros, but the Metro runs every 3 mins and it costs 1 Euro from the Airport and 2 Euros including Airport supplement going back! Open from 600 am to 2330 pm the metro to and from the Airport is a massive saving for travelling on a budget even in this splendour! Otherwise the Metro Link is open until 200 am, the stop at Cartagena is a stones throw from the hotel on Line 7 the Orange colour one!

Simple and efficient ,pay at outset and you walk out at your destination. Or you can get a ten journey trip, ten outs we called it and it cost just over 7 euros. To be honest we never bothered with this for when you get to Sol everything is walkable - Madrids centre is ultra small. From this hotel to Sol it's like stopping at Earls Court to get to Piccadily. Same time but a shorter distance. It's also closer than Sol for Real Madrid's ground, bear this in mind for the Champions League Final Chelsea fans!!! Santiago Bernabeu on Line 9 the purple one is bang outside the ground. For Athletico Madrid the stop is Puerto de Toledo, south and therefore closer to Sol. We walked it from Plaza Mayor a fantastic little square with Covent Garden type acts and restaraunts. Stopping on the way at a pub at De Toledo and later with a thousand or so Chelsea fans an old fashioned type police escort to the ground! Madrid is a lovely place and for \u00a31.99 at Luton Airport we got the Eyewitness Travel Madrid Pocket Map and Guide it was fantastic for Area's to visit and Restaraunts and Bars. We had a great time and all our meals were spot on, although the price of the Euro makes it rather expensive at the moment, clothes and perfume a definate no no.

The whole thing lends an air of excited anticipation... what will the room look like? Did I choose the \"best one?\" (My imagination wandered to how other hotels utilize the \"theme room\" concept, yet the Silken Puerta America, while dripping sensuality at every opportunity, doesn't even come close to the tawdry ...or banal.) As the outside-facing glass elevator doors opened onto the all-metal, sharp cornered, illusory \"Plasma Studio\" floor my jaw dropped. I felt a bit like I was in the hall of mirrors from that James Bond film. The room was no less exciting; it was entirely metal and glass, futuristic, gleaming, and uber-sexy. The designer apparently thought sex appeal would be heightened by including a completely transparent \"wall\" between the bathroom and the bedroom. That's right, the bathroom was encased only in glass, which did not become opaque when the door shut (as some do), nor when you turn on water, though the steam effect helps somewhat. I would suggest staying in this room solo, or else ensuring you're VERY comfortable with your partner... it's romantic, but if you're still into preserving that \"air of mystery\" this room will dispel it. Onto practicalities: the shower leaked, the bathroom flooded, and generally was a total mess. The management ended up moving me to another (far superior) room on one of the top floors, the Mariscal y Salas floor, which, though it looked as though it was a combination of African tribal motifs and 80s pop-art, ended up being a stunning, comfortable room. The room had a panoramic view of all of Madrid, of which the lights, viewed at night when laying in bed, were absolutely incredible. The bathroom was enormous, and the shower was an ultra-luxe, super-deep tub with about eight different shower heads and jets. The management was so apologetic about the first room, they included a fresh fruit basket, a bottle of wine and a personal note of apology awaiting me in the new room. Though this hotel is located quite far from the center of Madrid (about 20 minutes by cab and probably about 10-15 euros), it's very close to the airport; so convenience is relative. The hotel restaurant was amazing. The food was some of the best I'd had in Madrid; not being terribly impressed with the tapas and typical Spanish food I had eaten around the rest of the city. The rooftop bar is very cool with a sexy red vibe, great views of the city, and some really fun bartenders. I would recommend this hotel if I had a one or two night stopover in Madrid and didn't have a need to go outside the hotel... there is plenty enough to entertain you here, provided you appreciate a certain aesthetic.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cPoor service & basking in former glory\u201d", "Author": "adkarle", "ReviewID": "UR46716079", "Content": "Location - twenty minutes from the centre of Madrid.

Speaking of the 13th floor, the view from the dome is fab (barring in mind that you're not scared of heights or walking on the glass which allows you to see all the way down onto the motorway).

The taxis can quite easily charge you up to 15 euros into town and up to 25 euros to and from the airport. However, there is a metro nearby...although we didn't attempt at using it. The taxi drivers in particular either know where the hotel is situated and refer to it as \"that ugly building\" (which we found to be quite funny) or don't, so do write down the name of the road before you leave the hotel. Yet the rooms did make up for the poor location. Of course, you get to choose your own room and the design of every floor is different which is quite cool.

I stayed for business and thought the hotel was lovely and perfectly central for both work and tourist activities -- 15 min cab ride to/from the airport, 3 minute walk to the Metro station (loved the metro!) and/or a 10 min cab ride downtown. As you will read in other reviews of the hotel, each floor was designed by a different architect and has a completely unique layout and feel. My room was located on the second floor, designed by Norman Foster, in an ultra-modern white leather and stainless steel motif. (The walls were white, padded leather -- got quite a laugh about getting put in the padded room.) The hotel staff are all bilingual, so my very minimal Spanish was not a hindrance. The concierge desk was helpful planning tourist outings, assisting with travel arrangments and making dinner reservations. They recommended restaurants both within and outside the hotel and all were quite good, especially the MAD restaurant (in the hotel) and Chatflan, a 10 min cab ride away. Only two negatives: First, the breakfast buffet was wonderful, but at 35 euros per person ($52 USD) was terribly overpriced. Second, the hallway carpeting on my floor was badly stained and frayed; definitely out of place in such a high-quality hotel. All things considered, it was a wonderful, unique place to stay, and a great alternative to downtown hotels.

I have stayed in a few 5 star hotels but none have provide as much accessories as this, they provide a comb, toothbrush and toothpaste and even perfume! There is a small gym (treadmill, cross-trainner, rowing machine), small pool, lovely steam room and a couple of hot and cold experiences. Greatly appreciated after an exhausting day around Madrid. The only down side to it was the location as it was about 30mins on the metro to the centre of Madrid and involved a change of line, which after a few days can get exhausting.

We had booked for the Ron Arad floor, unfortunately, the hotel e-mailed us a week before to inform us that that floorm would be renovated. We then asked for the Plasma Studio floor. Our flight landed at 7am, we decided to show up at the hotel (even though check-in time is 14:00). The welcome was warm and the reception immediately gave us a room on the Plasma Studio (they also offered us to select any other floor if we wished..) The rooms in Plasma studio, are intesrting... But I do not recomend them to couples. The only dividion between the bathrrom and room is a glass wall, so that you have no privacy in the bathroom. The next evening, we decided to watch a PPV movie but the system was not working (around 10pm). I spoke to the reception who immediately proposed to switch us to new rooms. I asked for a different floor and they immediately (5-10 minutes) sent someone with our new keys and to help us with the luggage. We mov ed to the Richard Gluckman floor. The rooms were very nice (though less extreme). We did experience some trouble in trying to figure out how the shower worked. The room did not have a bathtub. Finally, one final comment regarding the food served in the restaurants. Boith rstaurants are excellent and I greatly recommend them. PS: On previous stays, I tried the Zaha Hadid floor (amazing: Hughe Bathtub!!!!!!!!! and very extreme design. - but small because of the curvy walls). and the Jean Nouvelle floor (only suites - very spacious, beautiful bathroom, and sliding panels dividing the rooms..)", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cA very different experience\u201d", "Author": "henrieta", "ReviewID": "UR10049023", "Content": "We were presented with a book of the individual floors in order to choose which floor was OK for us.

The bathroom was very bright, with a wooden bath and a little window leading to the bedroom through which we had a great view over the city from the shower.
