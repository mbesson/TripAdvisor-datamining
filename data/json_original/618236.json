{"Reviews": [{"Content": "great find, great location Stayed in the Darlo bar for 3 nights over new year - really not sure what to expect as even their inflated new year rate was only AUS $99 per night - really plesantly suprosed, and would recommendClean room, with bedding and towels changed daily - shared bathrooms always quiet, clean and warm!Bar downstairs can be a little noisy, but is a fab placeLocation great - 10 mins walk to kings cross station, but far enough away from the slightly more seedy areascloase to some fantastic places to eatwould stay again - suppose only things to mention - would not stay with kids, just not suitable, no lift so think about how heavy your bas are - and also - its a quirky area, arriving at night can be a little daunting - but really cool once you see it in day!", "Date": "Jan 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR591129998", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "oggybags"}, {"Content": "Great value for money! This hotel appears to have been recently refurbished. It was very clean and not particularly noisy, despite being above a bar (we stayed on the top floor). Shared bathrooms really was not a problem and they were all very clean. Staff were extremely friendly and relaxed. Great location for good bars and restaurants! So good that we are even going back this weekend!", "Date": "Jul 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR873924264", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Pamela_Partridge"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d618236-r12458730-Darlo_Bar_A_K_A_Royal_Sovereign_Hotel-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "618236", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
