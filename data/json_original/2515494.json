Great View.\u201d", "Author": "rosaritobeach", "ReviewID": "UR118009600", "Content": "This is a great resort. Different from other Worldmark properties because it is an urban location and an existing building that got renovated. It is right on the edge of Balboa Park and a short walk into the heart of the Gaslamp. Few blocks from the trolley station. And right off the Fwy exit if you do get a car, but not necessary. You can take the bus from the airport. And take the trolley down the the border. Can walk to Horton Plaza and do an all day tourist bus trip. this day bus trip is a jump on/ jump off tour. It will take you to the zoo and everywhere else for a first time visitor. It is a great location. Near everything, Just a short walk away. But back enough that it is quiet at night. A lovely roof top patio to enjoy. And not big bucks. Very nice small kitchen. Can fix the basics for breakfast. Some pasta, etc.... There is a large market downtown, near Horton Plaza. I love this location. Like many urban places, there are many homeless people in the area. During the day, there is no problem. Like anywhere, I would be careful at night. I would not rent a car here. but late at night, I would spend the money to take a taxi home after dinner, clubbing, or a move in the Gaslamp area. There are tons of all of these, just a few blocks away. You will spend less on a few taxis than you will per day to park the car.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWell worth the money\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3796992", "Content": "My family and I stayed at the Staybridge downtown for one night following a wedding. The hotel is quite nice due to its recent remodel/opening. Rooms were spacious, with a nice kitchenette and large tv/ dvd player. The roof was a nice little haven, overlooking the city. Breakfast was better than most you receive with your room but the food was nothing too great. I would recomend this hotel to anyone going to the zoo, or needing to get to the airport since it is very close to both. For the money, I think this hotel is great compared to others in the San Diego area. The area is somewhat skecthy with homeless wandering around, but probably no different than many other hotel locations and certainly nothing to be overly concerned with. I would recomend parking on the street if you want to save yourself $15, as there seemed to be plenty available spots when I stayed there.", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nationwide Traveler", "Title": "\u201cHidden Gem in Downtown San Diego\u201d", "Author": "Adogg", "ReviewID": "UR3574661", "Content": "I stayed at this Hotel 3 weeks becuase it was such a good hotel.

The rooms were nice and we were easily able to accomodate 4 adults. The king 1 bedroom suite we stayed in had a seperate bedroom with a fold out couch in the living room. There is a full size kitchen with a fridge, stove, microwave, etc. There are plates and stuff and they even provide you with coffee and popcorn for the first night. Also, there is a DVD player for each of the tvs! We walked to the end of the Gaslamp Quarter (there is a SPaghetti Factory at the end of 5th street) and it was a nice walk (20 minutes) and enjoyed seeing all the nightlife. The breakfast in the morning was excellent - probably the best we've ever had at a hotel. We took the advice of a previous guest and saved ouselves the $15 parking fee by parking on the street.

The staff is attentive and friendly. They have the standard free laundry, breakfast and sundown reception, but the building is a converted Art Deco that has been marvelously transformed. This property apparently just opened as a Staybridge in January '04. It doesn't look like other Staybridges (they've tried to keep the art deco fee), but has all of the same amenities - including DVD players in each room. The crown jewel is the rooftop deck. It's close to Balboa Park and walking distance to everything downtown. Yet, since it's not in the heart of downtown, you avoid the noisy partiers and homeless population. I definitely recommend it!!", "Date": "September 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highland, NY", "Title": "\u201cClean But Lacking\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2363516", "Content": "This is a very nice hotel, since it has been recently rennovated but there are some major complaints that cannot be ignored.

Whether you're alone, with your family or one of a group, you will be delighted and satisfied with this property. I am the co-ordinator of tradeshows for my company, and since I traditionally stay in the convention city at least a week, I find I need the following factors as criteria: a pleasant, home-y room (like an efficiency apartment or suite) with enough space to spread out, a kitchenette, windows that open, a decent sized closet and a bathroom with plenty of counter top space, in the $130.00 range. After searching endlessly (read:anal) I stumbled upon the Staybridge, which exeeded my expectations. Although the pictures online show a nondescript exterior, I dug deeper and found out this is a hotel where the money has been spent where it counts: on the staff and the interior- in short; catering to us, the customer. The common areas are appointed with beautiful Art Deco detailing,(accessories hand-picked by Michael Shaff, the manager), the rooms beautifully decorated, the front end and back up staff friendly and very accommodating,and as far as the entire establishment, nothing unkempt ,unclean or shabby. After my visit, I called Michael the manager to compliment him on his wonderful employees,and to offer suggestions for minor additions pertaining to comforting additions in the rooms (from the female perspective), to which he was very receptive. Don't miss the lovely top floor outside deck where barbeques and appetizer receptions are held a few times a week (hosted bY Michael, I found out ). The reception staff I dealt with (Lori and Kara) were fantastic, the maintainance manager, Horatio was attentive to what I requested, and the cleaning staff was unfailingly freindly. This property has plans to expand it's facilities and room capacity, and your business this next year will no doubt help. Advice? unless you don't need to see the surrounding areas, request an outside room, on one of the 2 sides that either don't face the current parking lot or Mc Donalds. (which, suprisingly, pipes out classical music.) The surrounding area is undergoing updates, but as of March '04, this would be my recommendation. Staybidge was very convenient to the Gaslamp and downtown districts; in fact I even walked it, but cabs were only about $5.00 and the trolley was only 2 blocks away, was $3.00 roundtrip and simple to do.
