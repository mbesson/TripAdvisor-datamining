We had three rooms booked months in advance at San Marco. However, on arrival, we were told there was NO third room available! We had to literally argue our way through to get the required no of rooms. upon check in we realized that the bathroom of one of the room was stinking badly and the basin was out of water. We were in a generally nice mood and would not have cribbed but the front office manager was really rude. He made it look like it was our fault...almost! He refused to act on the situation and after a lot of argument agreed to even come up and inspect the room. After this initial issue, we thought the rest of the stay would be smooth, but the AC in two rooms was not working! there was a control panel in the room but the AC vent was empty...Again the manager said that NO hotels in entire Rome had AC...it was unbelievable as the third room AC was working just fine! The staff at the Bar was also equally rude. We needed some hot water. But they told us we can give you hot water but not the kettle/ any vessel to carry it in. They simple did not understand hospitality or even the fact that we were actually paying for our stay and not staying there free of cost. The breakfast was more than pathetic. Most of the bread was not even fresh. The three days we stayed there, we did not have breakfast even though we were booked on Bed & Breakfast basis. If the keep the staff behavior aside, the hotel is quite nice...value for money. Rooms are spacious enough. Metro station is near by and many eateries at a walking distance. But I am sure Rome out of all the places has hundreds of better options for hotel that offer the above plus hospitable staff.

We weren't particularly expecting much from the hotel with the price of it compaired to many of the others in Rome but when we arrived we were plesently surprised. Our room was clean and very spacious with a seating area to watch tv, a dressing area and a resonably big bathroom. Although the hotel was in the middle of a big city once inside the room it was reasonably quiet and a massive bonus of this hotel was that each room has an individual air conditioning unit which can be controlled by the occupants rather than by the hotel. The location of San Marco can't be faulted, there are several small restaurants on the streets around the hotel so we never walked more than 10 minutes when going out for our evening meals and all of the food we had was very nice. If you don't mind walking most of the bigger tourist attractions can be walked to or both of the metro lines pass through the railway station so everything is easily accessible. There are a few downsides to the hotel though, the carpet in the main stairway was exceptionally dirty. Luckily we went up to our room for the first time in the lift, otherwse i think this would have completely put me off staying there, so i would advise everyone to always use the lift! The breakfast isn't great, it only really comprises of cereal, bread, jams, cheese, ham and scrambbled egg. Some fresh fruit or yougurts which might have been nice. There is only 1 mirror in each room, located in the bathroom which isn't great if one of you wants to be getting ready to go out whilst another one of you is in the shower. One other slight problem we had is that you only get supplied with 1 pillow each rather than the usual 2, so we didn't find the bed particularly comfortable. Our towels weren't changed the whole time we were there. One of them had a dirty mark on it which i dont think was from us and although i kept leaving the towel outside the bathroom door or in the bath it was never changed for a clean one! As i said at the start of my review we risked booking a cheaper hotel because we knew that with to much to see in Rome we wouldn't be in our room for much of the time and overall i think the risk payed off. There were several things about the hotel which could have been improved on but our actual room was good enough for what we needed. I think if i went to Rome again i probably would stay in Hotel San Marco as we definately thought it was reasonable for the price. Just as a slight aside about Rome, it can be very expensive when you buy things like bottles of water and ice-creams so we found that it was always worth going slightly off the beaten track to find the reasonably priced supermarkets. As an example we payed 2.5 euros for a standard small bottle of water near the colluseum and 8 euros for a standard ice cream cone near the spanish steps whereas from a supermarket we managed to get a bottle of water for 50 cents. Also if you're planning on going to the vatican museum its well worth prebooking your tickets on the vatican website. When we arrived there just after 9am the entry que was huge but because we'd booked our tickets we walked straight in!", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNeed a big lesson on service.

So the hot water in our room when off twice, once for more than a whole day! The 1st time it was quickly fixed as someone in a different room complained, 2nd time we realized it was gone again, picked up the phone to call reception at san Marco round the corner - PHONE didn't work! Walk round to San Marco to complain, NO hot water again, they rudely raised their voices at us (the 2 clowns on the desk) and said it would be fixed later, they did not seem at all concerned and wanted us to go away. Finally later that day water was fixed so we could wash, my husband had 1 cold shower while there. Breakfast was pretty good.

The scrambled egss are made from POWDER as in world war 2 The cutlery to the eggs are NEVER changed I could go on even more about the BAD hygene practices in this breakfast room but i think you have probably got the gist of it by now My wife and i are extensive travellers but i have never seen any food practices like this beforein any of the hotels or countries we have stayed in Any way we had a great time in Rome seeing all the sights etcand some Great FOOD OUTSIDE OF THE HOTEL CC Apri 2008", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cambridge", "Title": "\u201cLoved Rome, Hotel + My Gf for treating me!\u201d", "Author": "streak222", "ReviewID": "UR13319307", "Content": "Went to Rome with my Girlfriend for a long romantic weekend. We were not disappointed with either the Hotel or Rome and would highly recommend both! Easy Jet Flights - Nothing to exciting to tell you about - About a 2 hour flight from Stansted to Rome Ciampino Airport (the other airport is called Fiumicino, don\u2019t get them confused!) Transfer from Airport to Hotel - We decided to grab a Taxi to the hotel as the queue for the Bus was long. Taxi is a good choice, they are legally not allowed to charge you more than \u20ac30 for any destination in Rome city centre. Our fare cost \u20ac28 to the hotel and took less than 30 mins, even in Rome traffic. (If you ask the hotel to book you a taxi, they will book you their own private car at \u20ac50, make sure you ask for a White taxi for when you leave the hotel - no need to book on your way to Rome, Taxi rank was full on arrival) Hotel - My girlfriend cancelled our first choice hotel after finding San Marco on the web at a great price. The price we paid was incl Breakfast, 3 nights and 4 days. Worked out to be just over \u00a360 each in total. Hotel Reception was clean and we were met by the owner who spoke excellent English, all other staff also spoke excellent English and were always happy to help and answer questions. Hotel Lobby is small but with a nice bar which serves drinks 24 hrs. They also have a TV room which looked nice but we never used it. We were on the 6th floor in a corner room, 620. not sure if this made any difference compared to the other rooms, but our room was very big. Although Bed was two large singles pushed together, the bed was very comfortable. TV with good selection of films if you wanted to pay for it. Nice sofa and table in corner to use if needed. Bathroom was big and very clean, tiled floor with drainage so you don't have to worry about drying off in the shower - It looked brand new. Views from the room are what you expect in a city. Pls note - Floor 2 is being refurbished, although work only takes place Mon-Fri - Also 7th floor was being built on, but this did not ruin our stay. Breakfast - Was excellent, huge choice of food from fruit, toast, eggs and cakes, all served fresh from 7am till 11am. Eating out - Do try the local restaurants around the block from the hotel, great food and 10% discount if you ask for a card from reception. Average price we paid each night was \u20ac30. Watch out when going out for Lunch, you will probably be in a tourist area and the bills can be very high, we were charged \u20ac50 for a small lunch on our first day, we didn\u2019t make that mistake again and made sure we went off the main roads to find cheaper establishments. Location - Hotel is a good 30 mins walk to the Coliseum or Trevi Fountain. The train station is 5 minutes away and you will find the Metro here which will take you across Rome for \u20ac12 each for a 3 days pass. You will need to jump on the tube to go to the Vatican unless you enjoy a long walk. Great value for money. Print off a tube map before you go as some maps in Rome did not have these on them. The Map given out in the hotel Lobby is very good and easy to understand. Sight seeing TIPS - I would recommend you book your entrance fees before you go for both the Coliseum and Vatican. My girlfriend booked ours for the Coliseum and the Vatican. Because we pre-booked, we did not have to join the long queues, it costs a little extra but well worth it, the queues were huge. We turned up at the Vatican, a Tour guide met us, took us pass the queue and then kindly told us where everything was, then left us to it. 3 full days was just right to see everything in Rome, although your legs will feel very well used! Safety - I could not of felt safer in Rome, Police were on every other street corner. Hotel has the German Embassy down the road so we got 24hr armed police walking near by, which made you feel very safe walking around at night near to the hotel. Tubes were also well staffed and although you get the odd beggars selling Roses etc, they didn\u2019t bother you too much, a quick NO and they walk away. If we went back to Rome, then I would be happy to stay in Sam Marc again, Staff were friendly, hotel was clean, location was excellent, this was Great Value for Money! Feel free to ask any questions.

The room was very clean and although looked out to buildings at the back, was quiet and a view was not important to us as we were out all the time. The bathroom was all new and the shower was lovely. Fro breakfast there was a good deal of choice of breads,pastries, scrambled eggs etc. We walked almost everywhere, apart from when we went on an open topped bus tour on the first day which gave us our bearings. We picked this up from the Termini station, it was a good way to see everything. Rome is an amazing city, there is a historical building or monument everywhere you look.
