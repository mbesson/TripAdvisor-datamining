Not only was the breakfast area large, they had a good selection of things to choose from including freshly cut up fruit. Conveniently located means that there were a number of good sounding restaurants within a block or two and two food markets within several blocks. In addition, Pacific Northwest Ballet and a couple of theaters were also within a few blocks while others have mentioned proximity to the Space Needle and that area. A couple of potential downsides. The website for the hotel mentions a $15 fee for parking, but I was not charged for parking .... perhaps because I am a Hilton Honors member? Anyway, good news. Our room had a private patio and a nice view of the Space Needle, but the door to the patio had a rather flimsy blind so that a lot of light leaked into the room at night.

I was reluctant to book at this hotel due to a few recent negative reviews, but the other Hilton branch my husband and I love in Seattle wasn't available. Luckily, we ended up liking it just fine. The hotel isn't fancy, but it is very comfortable. Their staff was friendly, the rooms were clean, and the in-room internet was free. Nothing felt dingy. I can't give feedback on the free breakfast since we didn't get a chance to try it out. Parking was a little tight, but easy enough if you have a compact or mid-size rental. I don't know how comfortable I would have been if I had my mini-van with me though. It's helpful to back in to the spots even though the signs say head-in only. Note that there are two parking garages; the main one is on the left closest to the lobby, and a secondary one is to the right on a lower level. The lower level garage doesn't fill up as quickly, so I suggest parking there. Keep in mind that the secondary garage elevator does not go up to the top floor of the hotel, which is the 6th floor. We had to ride it up to the lobby level and take a second elevator to our room. It was a weird set-up, but worth it for easier parking. Although the name of the hotel says \"Seattle Downtown\", it's really about one mile away from the \"real\" downtown area. We already knew this ahead of time though. It's common sense to map out the distance of the hotel in relation to the places you want to visit prior to booking. The hotel is only two or three blocks from the Seattle Center, which was perfect for us since we were dining at the Space Needle and visiting the EMP Museum. There was a cool little Indie music store across from our room called Silver Platters that was fun to browse in. We also found a really nice 24-hour grocery across the street called QFC. (The office-like building didn't look like there'd be a market in it.) They had a Starbucks in the QFC as well, so that was super convenient. We drove downtown a few times for dinner, but in hindsight should have walked the mile there or taken a taxi since parking in the \"real\" downtown is really inconvenient and expensive. I am glad we paid for parking when we went to Pike Place though.

Since it was a reward stay, perhaps I shouldn't be too salty, but then again, I was charged a whopping 190,000 HHonors points for a two-room suite, so I guess I'm entitled to a negative opinion of this place. Since my complaints are numerous, I will just list them bullet style. -- Location - this place is NOT downtown as it is called in the marketing of the hotel Why not call it Hampon Inn Seattle Center? It is two blocks north of the Space Needle, so I guess if you're doing that while you're in town you will have a short walk. But to get downtown you have to take the Seattle Center monorail or a cab. Poor marketing on location here, folks. -- Noise - The construction at the actual hotel may be completed, but the surrounding construction noise early Monday morning was atrocious. We were awakened EARLY by the sound of jackhammers, dump trucks, loud crashes, etc.. There is a ton of construction/destruction going on one block east and north of the hotel. Of course my room was facing this mess. Not only is it an eyesore, but when you're on a mini-vaction and you want to catch some much needed sleep, you can forget about it (at least on one side of the hotel). -- Disgusting bath tub - At first glance, the suite was impressive. Spacious, full kitchen, nice gas fireplace, good sized bathroom. Then I pulled the shower curtain back and took one look at the tub and just shook my head (see attached photo). Not only did the porcelain have a quarter sized hole in it near the rear of the tub, but as you can see the entire tub had this HUGE grey stain from where a previous tub mat had been left too long and collected mold/mildew. Instead of replacing this tub, they just leave it be for guest after guest to walk in and say, \"YUCK!\"?? That just boggles the mind. -- Heating/AC - Alright... so it's nearing winter time in Seattle. Which means, damp, cold, mid 40's for highs every day. So I was looking forward to this fireplace thing. But the fireplace is not on a thermostat at all. It's on some stupid 5 minute timer. So on consecutive cold nights while watching TV in the living room and trying to enjoy the fireplace, you have to get up every 5 minutes and wind up the stupid timer? Please. On top of that, the separate bedrooms don't seem to have temperature control. Instead, they have this goofy looking old 1970's style wall mounted heat/AC unit. I hate to break the news to the property managers here, but as a Hilton Diamond who has over 500 nights on the road in the last 5 years, your hotel is the FIRST to offer such horrendous in room air conditioning units. -- Parking - So, I will give the hotel props for waiving my $8 daily parking fee for Diamonds. But I must say this - why charge for parking at all? There isn't a big demand for parking in this area is there? It's not like you're DOWNTOWN. And the parking? What a bizarre setup. The limited outside spaces are so narrow you can forget trying to get a full sized car in them. Then with the hotel built onto a hill there are two different parking garage entrances. But get this - the garages aren't hooked together. So once you do get parked and find an elevator things get extremely confusing. Oh, and the spaces in side the garage? Even tighter than the ones outside. Absoultely ridiculous parking situation at this hotel to say the least. -- Housekeeping - can someone please explain to me why one day the maids would clean the condo thoroughly including replacing the towels and then the next day they barely touched the place and did not bother replacing the wet wash cloths or towels that were purposely left in the tub to be replaced? Mind boggling. Staff - I have no complaints about the staff at all. The girls at the front desk are all very helpful and pleasant, as are the attendants working the breakfast area. Service here is probably the only high mark I can give. Breakfast - Typical Hampton Inn breakfast. Nuked powdered egges, Nuked greasy sausage. The line for the waffle maker was a mile long both mornings we ate here. Cereals/muffins/fruit/yogurt was well stocked and fresh.

I had a rental car and I was told to park down the street and basically the parking lot of a retail complex, upon my return I made sure I had understood the location properly to which I was told \"as long as you are in a numbered spot you are fine\" which of course would have been useful when I asked the first time. Aside from the trek down the street, the rooms were typical Hampton Inn, The internet speed was excellent, and the bed was soft with the room being clean. You can't argue with the location as the Space Needle was 10 minutes down the street; however aside from that there isn't too much around (especially in the evening) to keep you busy if you happen to check in early evening. Its not really downtown in the traditional downtown core sense of the word, but that is another story all together. The buffet breakfast was another victim of the construction blues; It was served in what I assumed was a conference room, and the seating was very limited with very little space to navigate returning to your table with a bowl of cereal. My understanding was it was a temporary location till construction was finished, however certainly worth baring in mind as there few alternatives for breakfast in the area.

The downfall of the hotel other than the construction (which I assume will soon be gone) is that it is a bit confusing.

Weekdays it was fine and plenty of seating available. My only gripe is parking - though they do have parking, I found nothing beforehand informing me that it was an additional $13/day to park! I found this odd since it is really not \"downtown\" and they have several covered garages and outdoor parking. it's not like they're hurting for space so this is just another money grab, IMO.

Now, the things keeping it from a 4 star in my book: while it has a good location, it is difficult to get to. Once you're there, parking is a nightmare, and they charge $12/night for parking (not a big deal, except that you then have to navigate the maze of garages to find a spot.) Once you are parked, the you must get from your car to your room, which is not as easy as it sounds. The hotel is many buildings connected together and only linked on one floor, so you will likely have to take an elevator to one floor, walk to the proper building, then take another elevator to your floor.

The best part of the hotel is the location and its complementary breakfast. The hotel is just about an 8 minute walk to the Seattle Center, home to the Space Needle, Sci Fi Museum, and Experience Music Project, among other things. There are a few restaurants near by but they generally didn't open until 5 pm or were coffee shops or were more of a walk than you'd first think. Front desk didn't have a map to consult nor was there a shuttle service as I've had at other Hampton Inns and Suites. Being near the Seattle Center, though, lowers your hotel rate yet you are still very near the Downtown area if you just take advantage of the Monorail, which is just $4 for a round trip. It drops you off at Westlake Center and from there you can easily access the Public Market and Waterfront. The hotel itself was clean. The layout is odd; lobby on the third floor; business center on the first. The entrance on 5th takes you to the lobby no problem, so just go in through that one. The room was clean and had standard Hampton amenities. The room was quite large and had a large safe, which was a nice plus. Service was ok. Once something needed fixing but I had to call out twice to get service. The breakfast was good. The Hampton Inns and Suites tend to have larger offerings than do the regular Hampton Inns and this one was no exception.

Breakfast is included and there was a good selection of cereals, toast, bagels, pastries etc plus a couple of hot dishes, food was nice and you could grab a 'breakfast on the run' from the front desk if you did not have time for a sit down breakfast. location was good, couple of blocks from space needle and monorail, we walked most places however without issue, there are homeless people in most areas but not a major nuisance. our only gripe is that when we were checking out we asked the staff for the best way to get 4 of us with large bags to the airport, we spoke to several different members of staff and they all recommended the town car service at a flat rate of $35, we queried several times if car would be big enough for our luggage and were advised no problem. when the car came to pick us up he said that we wouldnt be able to fit the luggage and would get a bigger car, they appear to be based at the hotel so this only took a couple of minutes, imagine our surprise when we got to the airport and he demanded payment for $65 due to having to use a larger vehicle (a suburban), we had no choice but to pay, at no time when he swapped vehicles did he mention a difference in fee, had we known we would have looked at other options. This incident ruined an otherwise great stay, I emailed the hotel about this a couple of days later to make them aware but there was no offer to refund us the additional cost.", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oswego, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Comfortable Rooms\u201d", "Author": "MarciaD720", "ReviewID": "UR7780860", "Content": "The Hampton Inn & Suites Seattle DT is located 1 block away from Seattle Center and with easy access to 99 and the I-5. This was a great location because it was within walking distance to the Seattle Center Attractions (Space Needle, Monorail, Experience Music Project, Pacific Science Center and Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s museum) . The monorail takes you right into the heart of the Shopping district and within walking distance of Pike Place Market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c makes a good alternative to driving a car. And for only $2 one-way very affordable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but back to the hotel. The Hampton Inn staff were very kind to me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c since I was staying for a week, they did put me on the 6th (top) floor facing the courtyard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so the room was quiet. Actually the rooms are very well insulated because I did not hear one shower/bath or toilet flush the entire stay. The only noise that penetrated the room was the doors shutting in the hall way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this was only a problem in the morning The beds are very comfortable and have nice white duvets and feather pillows. I stayed in a king room and got a good night sleep each night I was there. The bathrooms are large and have showers with good water pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although being on the 6th floor I did have to wait a bit for the hot water. I stayed in a regular room #617, so I cannot comment on the suites. Hampton offers free wireless high-speed internet access. I did have a little trouble accessing the internet wirelessly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but an Ethernet cord was provided in the room so once hooked up had no problems accessing the internet. For those that do not bring a computer with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel offers two computers in the lobby for guest use. The hotel computers are hooked up to a printer so it makes it easy to print maps, walking tours, tickets or boarding passes. Of course being a Hampton, they provide complimentary breakfasts. They always had a fruit, cereals, baked goods (muffins, bagels, toast) and hot breakfast option (my favorite being the French Toast Sticks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the waffles and scrambled eggs were also good). And in the afternoon they provided cookies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I was only back at the hotel early enough for these one day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the cookies were good! The staff of the hotel were very pleasant, for my first night they did provide information on local restaurants and an map of the local vicinity. In addition they provide me with information on the Northwest Folk Life festival that was taking place the first weekend I was there. The hotel offers parking under the hotel in three different parking areas. If you have a car they will assign a parking area to you. I heard that the cost for parking was $9.00 per night but I was not charges \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I am not sure if that was an oversight or if it truly is free. I recommend checking with the hotel before your stay. For those with a car, the hotel is conveniently located to several major highways which make getting in, out and around the city convenient. If you are staying in the city longer than a few days, I would recommend renting a car. Would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to others.

The Bad: Parking hell: $9 per day for their underground garage with spaces more suited for golf carts. With the cement beams every few feet, trying to park when the garage is partially full is almost impossible. Noise: Our room was on the 5th floor facing 5th Ave. Even with my trusty fan pumping out white noise, I could still hear the morning traffic. But this had to be better than camping out on the 1st floor. The tiny hallway located there is the main drag for all foot traffic heading to the elevators at the back of the motel.

Note most cabs here only hold 4 passengers, so larger parties need two. At $209/night, the price didn't feel like a bargain, but many hotels were sold out this date and substantially more expensive if available. The free breakfast makes it a better value, but with young kids the convenience is priceless. Front desk help was always pleasant and courteous, and despite a 24-hour advance notice policy for cancellations, they did not force us to pay for our room when we missed the first night due to a last minute problem with our flight.

Never stayed at a Hampton Inn before, but will certainly, highly, recommend this one to anyone staying in Seattle. Only there one night before getting on a cruise ship the following day, but we loved our stay. The staff couldn't have been any nicer to us. I did a lot of research before booking this and had read no negative comments about the place . . . now I see why. I booked this 5 months ago and got a great rate of $145 ($165 with taxes, etc.) for one of the two-bedroom suites. Had a full kitchen with dining area, 2 full bedrooms and 2 baths, a gas fireplace in the living room and a small patio off the living room. Both bathrooms were brand new and spotless, as was the kitchen. We were on the first floor so we had no partiulcar view, but going out onto the patio we could we some of the downtown skyline. Read comments about construction going on, and yes, it look lilke it still is. Must be taking them forever to put up the condo across the street, but we faced a side street (not the construction) and we were there on a Friday night and didn't hear any noise. A couple of pieces of furniture in the living room were a little worn and stained, but not horrendous, and that would be our only complaint. Far from a real complaint in my opinion for the great value and location. Someone posted somewhere that this was an iffy neighborhood. I don't know where that comes from since it's in the Queen Anne neighborhood fringe and only a few blocks from the Space Needle. Neighborhood looked just fine to me. Actually one I'd like to live in if I lived there. Well, I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea that we were very, very pleased by our choice and I think you will be too. Looking forward to going back and staying there again some day.
