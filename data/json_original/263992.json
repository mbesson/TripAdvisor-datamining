We arrived from Marco Polo (one of the nicest airports) by water taxi in the dark to the deep quiet and dark of the legendary city, which dropped us of at the Ponte Del'Accademia from where it was a short walk through a large square and a narrow street to the hotel. Looking on Google Earth helped to identify our location. The Locanda is a small, warm and welcoming six-bedroomed hotel. After registering, and expecting to be led upstairs, we were escorted outside and round the corner to an old dark door. A little unnerving? Perhaps. We need't have worried. We had been given a free upgrade to a very spacious studio apartment, which is in a seperate building with its own kitchenette and balcony with large sofa-bed, formal chairs, dining table and huge king sized bed on the high mezzanine. having this apartment gave us the freedom to bring food back to make our own lunches/dinners on a few occasions, and just enabled us to relax more. We were very lucky to be given this upgrade because even before Easter we woulod no have been able to afford it normally. Nature also gifted us perfect weather for the entire five days. Breakfast, Italian style, which is croissants, bread, jams and coffee was brough to the room. The apartment is off the square on a narrow residential street in San Marco. Whilst being wonderfully convenient (Piazza San Marco being only a leisurely 15 minutes walk away; the Grand Canal is maybe three minutes away) it also has the advantage of being delightfully quiet, even onto the street (there are 5 apartments in the building, some of which are onto the garden at the rear). All the staff at the hotel are very kind and helpful and we were able to borrow guidebooks. Towels were replaced every day, though we didn't expect it. The only thing we would have liked, being English, would have been a bath, which is available in some apartments/rooms. Even with this minor point, I have no hesitation in awarding the Locanda Art Deco five stars and we will happily go back to this hotel, in this refreshingly civilised city.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mosta, Malta", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money and great location!\u201d", "Author": "Sophie T", "ReviewID": "UR124052632", "Content": "The hotel is in a perfect location; a 10 min walk to Piazza San Marco and a few mins to a vaparetto.

On arrival we were told that \"the air conditioning was broken\", which meant that we would have to spend the first of 4 nights in the hotel's sister apartments, in the next street, up three flights of stairs, and in a loft room where we couldn't lock the bathroom (so the people in the flat below could have walked in at any moment). We were disappointed at first, particularly when we also saw the breakfast 'room' which consisted of a small landing with about 6 tiny tables - all of which were occupied so we had to stand and wait for a few minutes before a table was vacated. The breakfast itself is very basic, expect a hot drink plus either a croissant or cereal. To be fair to the Locanda Art Deco, there was really no where else to put a breakfast room and they did make the most of the space they have - Venice is not known for its gigantic open spaces, and as most of the buildings are probably protected, installing elevators is practically impossible. We complained - not least because we hadn't even received an apology for the inconvenience and then had to drag our own luggage back to the hotel for the rest of the stay. But they did listen, and after we complained they really made the extra effort to appease us. The hotel room (M1) was lovely, very clean, with traditional beamed sloping ceiling, and a tv and internet access in the room. The bathroom was very clean although the shower leaked but this wasn't a major problem. The staff gave us a mixed service - mostly very helpful and forthcoming with advice about where to go and the best way to get there, but unfortunately there was the occasional 'can't be bothered' approach. If you're in Venice to see the city and are not likely to spend much time in your hotel at all, then this is a great place to stay as the good price makes up for any fall-downs. (P.S.

We usually stay at three star hotels when traveling because they are family run, small and the service is better than the large chain hotels. The hotel and residence is located off the S.

We found Locanda Art Deco Residencia had one (1) room available. It must have been the last hotel in Venice that had a room and would accept pets. Traveled from the parking garage by ferry to the S. Samuele stop. It was an easy walk from the boat to the hotel. Upon arriving, we entered and the receptionist was busy and like the Italian way, took her time getting to us. That is something you have to get use to in Italy. It is not rude, it is just their way. We were booked and shown to the room which is in another building. The accommodations turned out to be an apartment in the loft which you could say was two stories. The apartment slept two in the loft area upstairs and one in the living area downstairs. And the apartment even had a kitchen area. If you use the kitchen area there is a Euro30 surcharge for cleaning. There was no lift, but the room and facilities were clean. A computer, internet, tv and dvd player are provided. If you rent at the residence part, your breakfast is served in your room between 08:00 AM and 10:00 AM. It is a continental breakfast which you need to order the night before either by stopping in at the hotel itself which is around the corner or by dialing 10. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and great on making reservations for concerts, excursions, taxi's, dinning, etc. They are knowledgeable and know the good and unusual places. All you need to do is ask. There were several minor points which the hotel needs to address which were brought to their attention and they knew about and are addressing. The safe in the residence is not bolted down or into the wall. So, someone can walk away with your valuables if you use the safe. The furniture needed cleaning. Check out time is 10:00 AM, but you can ask for a later time and if they room is available, they will extend check. If you want the Italian experience, try the Locanda Art Deco hotel or residence.

Just steps from the vaporetto and the Accademia bridge, it takes less than 10 minutes to walk to Piazza San Marco. Two suggestions though: don't ask for restaurant recommendations from the hotel staff, I think they get kickbacks and both restaurant recommendations were duds. Also, it is lovely that you can book a gondola ride from your hotel (rather than dealing with the rude gondoliers on the street), but Alex (the lady gondolier) has very little personality and tends to be less than pleasant.

Our room overlooked the calle so we heard conversation, etc from neighboring restaurants and stores until closing time(midnight). Since we're up late, it didn't bother us but someone who is early to bed might have difficulty. Mornings weren't a problem.

It's very near San Angelo vaporetti stop (2-3 min walk) and also San Samuele. Venice seemed tiny to us, the map looked big, but we got around in no time so I think most locations are great, but this was ideal for us. Quiet at night for sleeping, little shops etc around the corner to pick up some groceries, and a couple of nice little bars for a spritz. Everything else is only a vaporetto or walk away anyway. We stayed 3 nights in Loft 4, but on the morning after our first night the heating broke. My only complaint about our whole stay was that the night concierge who handled our first night of cold was rather blustery and unhelpful. He did get us a little gas heater very quickly, and that helped overnight the two nights we waited for an engineer (first night a Sunday, then a Monday a Venetian holiday), but it wasn't without a lot of huffing and puffing! However, we didn't see him again, and found the rest of the staff very welcoming and helpful, and we were delighted with the service overall. Their email comms are great - always almost instantaneous replies. When they realised the heating problem was complicated, they moved us to Loft 2 and we spent 4 nights there. The two rooms are very comparable. Both have a TV, digibox, even a little computer in each. The two ring hob and decent sized fridge were ideal for a couple of nights in. The rooms are immaculately clean, they look freshly furnished but not ikea. Loft 2 has a proper shower cabinet, Loft 4 only a shower in the bath so you have to sit down which is a bit of a faff. We didn't take breakfast so no comment to make on that. Great place, I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed at all. Really great value in a city as expensive as Venice. Two great finds in Venice for us were 'La Cantina', Campo San Felice, Cannaregio, and 'Alla Bifora', Campo Santa Margherita, Dorsoduro. La Cantina for the fab staff who really know their wine, and their absolutely delicious fish plate (25 Euros pp, but we ate dreadful food elsewhere for the same price or more, more than once!), and Alla Bifora for candlelit atmosphere, lovely mixed meat and cheese plates, and great spritzes.

Great location, one square away from San Marco, near the San Sammuele \"vaporetti\" (water bus). Our room was on the top floor (3rd floor, no lift) and was clean, comfortable though part of the room was cut by the pitch of the roof. The breakfast was generous.

I almost choked with laughter at the March 22 review, about shifting guests from place to place, and thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d contribute our experience in 2003. We had booked an apartment through the Locanda Art Deco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, with many emails to Judith, who I assume is the owner or manager. When we arrived at the ferrovia, we called the Locanda, but the man who answered didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what we were talking about when we said that Luciano was supposed to meet us at the vaporetto stop. So we hopped on #82, got off at San Samuele, dragged our bags to the Locanda, and announced that we were booked to stay in an apartment. He had no record of our booking, so tried to call Judith, with whom I had been communicating, without success. Eventually he said that there had been a mistake, that we could stay at the Hotel Al Sole for one night and then get our apartment the next day. We had no choice, so he called a water taxi, walked us back to San Samuele, we rode in style to the rather crummy hotel, checked in, left our bags in our room with a bad bed, and set out to see the area where we were staying so we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to return. We both complained to the desk clerk and I was really steaming. My husband told Reception that he wanted to talk to Judith, so after breakfast, he called her and she told my husband that the people in the apartment overstayed for one night and that we would be taken back to San Samuele in a water taxi, Luciano would meet us and take us to the apartment. He told her that she had really disappointed us, had made us waste time, and that we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay full rate for the night in this awful hotel. We settled on a saving of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50. Packed up, water taxied back to San Samuele, and there was no one there. But in about 5 minutes, Luciano arrived, smiling, and told us that we would be staying at the Locanda instead, at the same price as the apartment, which was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30/night less. Walked to the Locanda, left the bags at the desk, and off we went. After a day of sightseeing, we returned to the Locanda. Our room was lovely, except for a squeaky bathroom door, just a hand shower in the tub, no CNN or other English channel, and an unlockable window that opened onto a roof or terrace that could have provided entry to someone. At breakfast one morning, we were alone with an American couple -- the couple who were sitting in the lobby with their bags when we returned to the Locanda for our first night here. I asked them whether their room had a hand shower like ours or a real shower. But they were in an apartment, although they had expected to be at the Locanda, and just having breakfasts there. We suddenly realized that the reason we were in the Locanda is that Judith must have decided to disappoint them instead of us, since we had made so much fuss, and they had been in the lobby waiting for someone to take them to the apartment. We asked them how they liked the apartment -- they said it was fine, except for the person above them who seemed to be practicing flamenco dancing. Did we luck out!

If you like small, quaint hotels this is definitely the place to stay in Venice. Great position, exceptionally clean rooms and the service was excellent. Giuseppe, the Sales Manager, on reception was always very helpful. We booked by email which was dealt with very efficiently. We took advantage of booking Alexandria from the hotel - the only female gondaliera in Venice. We went early evening at 7.30pm and it was the icing on top of the cake.

Great location & had the vaporetto not been on strike on the day we arrived, which meant we had to lug our luggage from the Rialto bridge, which in 90 degree heat is no picnic, I would have no criticisms at all. Getting to the hotel absolutley shattered & boiling and finding no lift, which meant having to carry our own cases up all the stairs was not fun. Had we been able to get off at the Academia bridge this would not even be an issue. So I would say stay here it's a nice place but not if getting up & down stairs is a problem.", "Date": "March 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glen Rock, NJ", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location, Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "NJFlint", "ReviewID": "UR4386890", "Content": "We booked this hotel based on Rick Steves' reccomendation and stayed there for 2 nights in January 2006. This hotel met our expectations. As everyone agrees, the location is superb, within a 2-minute walking distance of the vaporetto stop and very close to everything that Venice has to offer. The staff is nice and friendly (special thanks to Giuseppe who takes his job very seriously). The room (a double) was fairly small but clean. Basic breakfast, nothing to complain or brag about. All in all, we will definitely stay there on our next trip. For the sake of full disclosure, here are a few minor problems we encountered during our stay: (1) the boiler in our room was probably too small as we once ran out of hot water during the morning showers and (2) they forgot to give us clean towels but immediately complied with our request.", "Date": "January 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay in room 100\u201d", "Author": "TVnMe", "ReviewID": "UR4232595", "Content": "Ok this hotel was lovely, cute, nice breakfast area great area the nicest staff. But when we walked in our room all the loveliness went away. First thing the hotel staff member did was look under a rug that was nailed to the wall. When he left we looked at what he was looking at, there was a huge hole to the left of our bed that was filled with paint and plaster and all those sort of supplies. There was bug blood splatters all over the walls. The room had a smell to it, probley from the paint. And at the other end of the room there were three broken chairs stacked by the window. This room seemed more like a storage closet. Because the room smelled we had to keep the window open at night, and we got bite 6 times by mosiquitos. We looked in other rooms on the way to breakfast(the maid was cleaning and has the doors open) and they all looked lovely.
