Against all of those hotels, the good, bad and ugly, Hotel 1000 very clearly distinguishes itself at the very top of the list. Based on something like 10 stays, I cannot name a single thing I would suggest needs improvement. Specific factors that make this place so outstanding for me include: -an absolute first-rate attitude toward guest service, shared by every single member of the staff, displayed in every interaction -amazing rooms, with furnishings and fixtures that are just superb, and panoramic harbour views if you end up on the water side -a great location steps from Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, etc. -a tremendous restaurant and bar, fantastic bartenders", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWorth Every Penny\u201d", "Author": "Rhiannon5", "ReviewID": "UR127542969", "Content": "Yes, it is like the photos where we could see that a nearby hotel was not.

There may well have been small refrigerators available had we asked, sadly, we didn't think of it until we left. The only hiccup we encountered was the service in the Golf Club which was not up to the same great standards as everything else in the hotel. We waited for an hour before a server checked on us only to have them forget our cocktails twice and to bring our check at the end of our game. While the hotel is a great location for accessing Pike Place Market and the waterfront (cruises, ferries, the Aquarium) it's a bit further from the retail district - Pacific Place, Nordstrom, Westlake Center, etc. and if you're planning to visit the Space Needle, EMP, Pacific Science Center, it's a small trek through Belltown.

I couldn\u2019t help but try my hand at a few games I\u2019d never seen on the Microsoft Surface touch screen table while I warmed up from the wet Seattle weather. ROOMS The rooms at Hotel 1000 range from 390 square-feet to the 2,000 square-foot Grand Suite. Every room has another distinctive touch \u2013 a unique pedestal bathtub that fills from the ceiling. As cool as that is, what is a bathtub without a rubber ducky? Clearly this hotel thinks like I do because one was waiting for me, perched on the side of the impressive tub! Each room is equipped with a coffee maker (although why not take full advantage of the delicious coffee steps away in any direction? This is Seattle!). The modern slate blue and rust room d\u00e9cor goes the extra mile with beds bejeweled in Thai linens and down pillows. In addition, most lights are dimmable. Finally! The rooms and suites feel like downtown apartments. Although the design elements are consistent throughout the hotel, the ambiance in each room is personal. I could easily imagine coming home to a suite like the ones in this hotel after a day spent at the famous Public Market. BEYOND THE ROOMS I am not a golfer, but I know fun when I see it. Downstairs from the lobby is The Golf Club, a \u201cstate-of-the-art virtual golf\u201d room with two stations. The golfer stands on turf and lets the ball fly onto a floor-to-ceiling fabric screen that mimics a course. Depending on how the ball hits the screen, the score is tallied. I can honestly say it is the best game of golf I\u2019ve ever played. DINING My husband and I dined in Boka, Hotel 1000\u2019s in-house restaurant, for breakfast the morning after we checked-in. Our server brought us a complimentary basket of pastries that made waiting for the food a pleasure. There are two entrances to Boka, one from the hotel\u2019s lobby and one from the street.

The bed was perfect, the Television was clear and worked quickly, which I can't say about many hotels. The decorations were great, I loved the art on the walls. Design couldn't be better, neither could the soaps and toiletries. I can't rave enough about how much I loved this location. Even the hotel restaurant was amazing. I ordered the chicken and waffles, Mac and Cheese, three cocktails, and paid less than I did at my last hotel for a Philly Cheese steak and a coke! The prices were amazing, almost as amazing as the food and drinks. But I will say that the drinks are either on the Tart or Sweet side. Every time I was told a drink was not too sweet or too sour, I felt that it was. My only other qualm, was that my room key was deactivated before I had departed and the woman I called on the phone at the concierge desk (not front desk), was not very friendly, so I went to the front desk and they were happy to help me. If you love your technology, fine art, great sleep, and the ability to impress your guests, this would be the place. Any husbands out there who are looking for something romantic to do for Valentines day, take your wife here for food and drinks, then head up to your room.

The room service food arrived promptly, was hot and high quality; AND it wasn\u2019t terribly expensive. Baku, one of the onsite restaurants, was excellent \u2013 they have a full menu and a full page of tapas-size small portion plates. I had grilled octopus and fried cheese grits. The curtains made the room very dark and quiet; wonderful sleep quality; high quality sheets as well. What puts it over the top is the attention to service. The front desk answered promptly each time I called and responded to every request. When I retrieved my car from valet parking, they put fresh bottles of water in the front, offered directions, and held out the seatbelt to make seating easier \u2013 the parking staff was obviously very well trained on service.

As I approached the hotel and entered, from the staff that greeted me and opened the door, to the concierge, to the check in staff, everybody was friendly and professional. The ambience of the hotel, albeit with a no-nonsense lobby area, is crisp and trendy. There's a side room connected to the lobby with the large, modern fireplace for a cozy area to relax out of the cold. Again, the Hotel1000 staff is always pleasant, clean, and prompt to see if they can be of any service to me. They don't wait for me to approach them, which is great and shows an attention to service. The staff does seem to be on the younger side, but don't count that as a negative. They bring their energy without losing any courteousness. Since that first visit, I've stayed here a number of times. A couple times I was upgraded to a suite, without me asking if one was available. They have a firm understanding that all guests should be treated well, but they also have a great understanding that repeat guests should be made to feel extra special. This is good business and also really builds the relationship and loyalty. All of the rooms I've stayed in were nice, clean, and spacious. Good, classy decorations are used and the walls and furniture have a calm, warm color palette (no gaudy or dingy furniture here). The layouts of the rooms are open. The tubs with the ceiling spouts are an interesting feature. The only small complaint I might say is there needs to be more room lighting for after the sun goes down, BUT I would say this about all hotels. I just like it bright. To be fair, these rooms are some of the brighter ones I've stayed at for hotels. The BOKA restaurant attached to the hotel is a great place to eat when you don't want to head out to find another restaurant. Breakfast is particularly good, especially with the complementary bread basket. I would say it would be nice to have a larger selection of entrees (but maybe that's because I've eaten there so many times), but overall not a bad array of choices. As mentioned, whenever I have visited Seattle I have stayed at this hotel, and the one time I didn't was because the hotel was all booked. Bummer.

Specifically, while the floor staff was friendly, I got the feeling they were all a bit too passive when given the opportunity to go the extra mile, from getting a towncar to helping find a park for my dog. My take is that the staff is just a bit too green (mostly young kids) and could use more training to get them to a '5 star' service level. Again, not bad...but not great either. Also, while the french press is nice, Hotel 1000 should step it up a bit and upgrade the Starbucks bag of coffee for some local beans. As a bonus, the hotel is dog friendly, providing complimentary dog bed, biscuits, dog bowls and toy. But they surprisingly don't have any ready to go dog walking service (I'd expect this for a top of the line hotel in a big city).

As a resident of Los Angeles I wanted to make my visit amazing, so in June of 2011 I got the idea to rent out a big hotel room and put together a surprise Christmas dinner for my family of 14 that would blow their socks off. So, who did I count on to help me find the best place? My peeps at tripadvisor.com. And wow, did reviews steer my in the best direction possible. After looking over all the data, I knew my decision had to be Hotel 1000. I chose it, sight unseen (I mean, I saw everyone's photos, which were crazy helpful). After booking the room, they put me in contact with their director of catering, Brooke Byrne and with her help, we came up with a crazy, awesome menu that would knock everyone's socks off. And I gotta say, this woman was so on the ball... it was like she was reading my mind. All my ideas she took and made better. Well, everything about this dinner was amazing. From the reception of the front desk (thanks, Michelle) to our servers that took care of us all night (thanks Oscar and Trev). And at the end of the night when the room's DVD system broke down, what did the hotel do? Oh, you know, open an entire other suite for us and set it up like a movie theater so we could all watch a movie together!!!! If that's not above and beyond, I don't know what is!!! This place was amazing! Top to bottom, I was taken care. I would never hesitate to go back, and I only hope you guys get a chance to stay here. P.S. Jennifer Formez, the pastry chef here, took it upon herself to make my favorite dessert (a Paris-Brest) and my Dad (a big food blogger in Seattle) happen to write an article about it because it was soooo good (http://www.cornichon.org/2011/12/paris-brest-and-stp.html)... the experience was truly magical. I loved this place and can't wait to come back! Thanks again, Hotel 1000...

Valet and housekeeper staff were all very nice and polite, unfortunately front desk was just ok... They were just there did their job, nothing special. We booked the city deluxe but we decided to upgrade to a corner room which i was told almost double the size, but in reality probably only 25% bigger with big corner windows plus sitting area. View was just ok, couldnt see much, blocked by the big building. We stayed on the 10th floor and could hear some noise from the street. Room was nice, had seating area, coffee press maker, tea, ipod dock, comfortable bed, nice bath robes and turn down service. I was told by the nightime manager who showed us the room before we upgraded it that the room could sometimes cost up to $1,000... Definitely NOT worth $1,000, no wow factor at all. Bathroom was spacious, separate toilet, shower, and free standing bath tub with the strange water coming out of the ceiling, however i hated taking a shower here. It took me forever to wash my hair! Terrible showerhead water pressure! To make it worse, i had to use the \"community\" molton brown soap. It reminded me so much of a gym shower where you have this public shower gel bolted to the wall to share with millions of other people. The dfference is this was worse because the pump in on the top, so i could imagine when the housekeeper refill the bottle, the older soap keep sitting on the bottom of the bottle while the the newer one sits on top, never gets rotated. This explains the black powdery looking stuff that sit on the bottom of the bottle very much. The bottle neck too was all moldy, probably never been taken out to be cleaned either since its bolted. I called the housekeeping to see if they had a different soap but they said no. So finally i found this one small NEW bottle of bath gel sitting on the bath tub which i aways asked for and used for the rest of our stay. I'd rather take a shower with a \"cheap\" soap than molton brown soap but have to share with others. I want my own new shower gel. Who is molton brown anyway? I didnt feel anything special after using the gel. Sorry! 5-10 mins walking uphill to pike place market. Not the best location but not bad either and pretty convenient. I asked if we could use the hotel car to be dropped off at the train station to go to the airport during check out but the driver was on lunch break, and the other driver was watching the hotel door since there was nobody else. Why cant they have extra people to watch the door??? Id try a different hotel when i go back to seattle, somewhere more happening perhaps.

I was dissapointed in the value of the hotel. I made the decision to pay extra to upgrade my room two levels, from The basic room to the grand luxe corner suite. Staff: C- Check-in was nothing more than average. Front desk staff was pleasant but no more friendly than a holiday inn or embassy suites staff. I am low maintance and dont usually need much help from staff or concierge. I wasn't greeted by any staff throughout the stay, not even bell man. I asked at check-out if she could arrange for a cab to pick me up, and she hesitated to help me. She told me taxis are driving by non stop so It's easy to get a cab. I had issues with my room at check-in, and the employee told me to stop by tomorrow and the manager could put me on higher floor (I didnt really care what floor I was on). The staff at the Boca bar was really nice, epecially the bartenders. Room: B Overall the room was nice, but not nice enough for what I paid. Since I paid extra to upgrade, I expected a little nicer view or slightly larger room. My bathroom didn't have the cool bath tubs (with water from ceiling), the view was not great from 7th floor. The view from my window was an empty office building and a bunch of heating and ac vents. My bathroom didnt even have an enclosed shower or toilet. My bathroom had a gross shower curtain, it seemed odd. I could barely fit in it it was so small. The floor to ceiling windows were really nice. The beds werent really soft. The room overall (except the shower curtain) was very clean, otherwise I would rate this room lower. Location: b+ The hotel is within a short walking distance of everywhere you need to go downtown. The hotel is located right next to a 24-7 porn shop called taboo. It seemed out of place. The other downtown hotels look slightly closer to the shopping areas. The hotel has a star bucks across the street which was nice. Spa/pool: no review Restaurant: I didnt eat at the restaurant or order room service. The bar was nice and the staff was friendly here. Other issues: I requested a different room when I checked in, hoping for a different bathroom or better view. Again, I only made this request because I paid more to upgrade (but it didn seem like I had an upgraded room). So I went from 7th floor to 10th floor to a different room. The room looked like a dungeon with no view in corner of building. I ended up going back to my original room. Overall value: C+ Overall, for the price I paid I wish I would have stayed somewhere else. The only positives were champagne at check-in, panoramic windows, free wifi and an easy walk to shopping and market. I could have stayed at the 4 seasons or another nice hotel for this price range. Nothing stood out for me, and I have no idea how others claimed to have exceptional customer service. The management needs to take a look at improving its customer service. Before I checked in I attempted to contact the hotel twice, with no response to my voice mails. I told them at check-in it was strange, but the staff shrugged it off.

My inner critic did not make a peep during my stay at the Hotel 1000. I know everyone has different expectations and needs when they travel so I'll try to be as detailed about my my experience as possible. First off, I live in Seattle. I wasn't just looking for a comfortable place to sleep. I was looking for a beautiful place to sleep in. I was lucky enough to stay in a deluxe room which had a bathroom with a walk-in shower, a jet tub and a glass wall that looked out into the bedroom. For privacy there was a remote controlled curtain. The rest of the room was laid out in a such way that didn't feel overcrowded or empty (keep in mind though I'm 5'2\" and 112lbs). I loved the heavy double layer curtains that helped more with my sleeping in objective. The colors, and decor were modern but also inviting. I love walking so for me the hotel was perfectly located. If you don't like hills then Seattle may not be a city for you or you may want to consider renting a car -however valet is expensive just like every other hotel in any other city. The Hotel is on on the same street as Pioneer Square and the Pike Place Market but you have to walk 5-6 blocks up or down a slight hill depending on which direction you're going. It's about 3 blocks from the waterfront and a good 15min walk to the center of downtown where most of the bigger name clothing stores are. It has a medium size gym, a small spa, and a restaurant with great happy hour. But all of this sort of pales in comparison to the service. It's on point without being stuffy. They appreciate that you're there -and I never felt anyone make me feel like it should have been the other way around, even though I really did appreciate being there too.

As has been thoroughly covered in previous reviews, the bathroom was great with the tub that filled from the ceiling and an awesome showerhead, as well as high end toiletries. (I acutally used the shampoo and conditioner, which is unusual). They must've turned back the pressure, because the splashing when filling the tub was minimal, and they've also included small bottles of bath gel so that you don't have to get it out of the larger dispensers in the shower. The rubber duckie was a fun touch. The lighting in the rooms is superb, with most of the lights on dimmer switches. The bedding was some of the best I've encountered. We walked all over downtown Seattle, and I don't think there could have been a better location, roughly halfway between the Market and Pioneer Square. If you're driving or renting a car, be prepared, there is little overnight parking available in the area, and we ended up having to use the valet a couple of evenings when returning after many of the garages had locked up for the night (6:30pm). The valet is quick and professional, but at $40 plus tip, it's more than I'd like to spend. On the nights that we did make it into other garages, (didn't utilize valet), it cost $20 overnight.

When i arrived the valet was prompt and I was upgraded upon check in to a bay view Suite. It was beautiful. The room service food was actually GREAT- it came from their restaurant Boca and was no different then dining at the actual restaurant. The bartender Michael was so friendly and was able to give me some good pointers about places to go and see in Seattle. The hotel is literally 3 blocks walking to Pike's Market (maybe 5-7 minutes) and there are shops all along the way you can go through. The hotel also offers a courtesy vehicle to drop you off at a location if you desire. I had to check out about 3:30am and the front desk was so helpful, they brought my car around, loaded my bags and sent me off with directions back to the airport. I typically stay at Four Seasons, but the Seattle location was sold out and I was truly hesitant about giving another hotel a shot- but I am so glad I did, because this is a hidden gem of a place, great prices (1/2 the price of the Four Seasons), great food, and helpful staff.

The doormen are really nice (and cute too!) Check-in was easy and the room we had looked out on the sound. We could watch the ferry come and go. The location is truly the best in Seattle and you are only a couple of blocks to great shopping. Best of all, the licey mob from Pike Place is a good five blocks away. Now the problems: The tub fills from the ceiling and when it starts it literally splashes water all over the bathroom. The new wallpaper was already starting to peel in some areas. While cute in concept, the execution left a soggy mess. The second one is that the shower and toilet areas share the same 'airspace'. Not to be too graphic, but the person in the shower in the morning will be sharing some not as pleasant air if you happen to be sharing the bathroom (which it's almost impossible not to do). I would advise the hotel to increase the fan speed of the vent, but there's not much to be done as the design is already set. Overall the design of the bathroom is a flawed one; beautiful to look at, but a mess in execution. All this being said, I still love the Hotel 1000 and would not consider staying anyplace else while visiting Seattle. If you are flying into SEA, book the car through the hotel concierge.

Really. I liked the layout, the design, the beds, the bathrooms etc. While I was not as enraptured with the tub that filled from the ceiling as most seem to be (for one thing it splatters water like crazy) the tub itself was probably one of the most comfortable I've ever experienced in a hotel. Usually they are either too big or too small ( or too gross) to bathe comfortably, but this was the Goldilocks Tub, just right in terms of size. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room had everything you could ask for and more, including robes that I didn't feel squeamish putting on. We tried out the spa, and it was excellent and we had two very nice massages though the prices are a bit steep (perhaps that is the usual for Seattle but it was more than a third above what we are used to paying...I can't really compare prices due to being unfamiliar with Seattle's base price but we've had massages in almost every geographic region of the US and these were definitely among the most expensive). However, the spa was very nice. The gym was adequately equipped. The location was excellent, in easy walking distance to several local attractions and the staff was universally friendly, helpful and pleasant and we had no problems whatsoever with any of the amenities features or room service. I am dinging this hotel a single star for one specific reason, that is possibly not an issue for the weekend traveler, and I have recently decided that I am going to ding every hotel we stay at that does not provide this service: a guest operated laundry facility. When we travel, we travel for extended periods of time and we don't like to stay at flea bag hotels which appear to be the only ones that offer coin-operated laundry services any more. The upper end hotels (and even the mid-range hotels) now rely on severely over-priced laundry services that are completely ridiculous. We arrived at Hotel 1000 and we had about ten days worth of laundry to do and still a week left on our vacation--a major laundering was needed. Hotel 1000 charges $9.00 for a pair of pants to be laundered. I priced out having my laundry sent out to be cleaned and realized that the total to do my laundry would have been about $250 and that's if I sink washed socks and underclothes! If they offered a coin-operated laundry unit, I could have washed the same clothes in roughly two loads for less than $20. I found this completely ridiculous. I don't believe the extended traveler should be gouged on laundry, nor should they have to schlepp their dirty clothes to a laundromat (in this case the closest one was 2 miles away) and I don't believe it's entirely beyond the realm of space considerations to place a coin-operated laundry facility on hotel premises.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glen Burnie, MD", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Place\u201d", "Author": "Xploringtheworld", "ReviewID": "UR118627270", "Content": "My husband and I loved this hotel!!

I was not disappointed. They gave us a great view of the sunset over the Olympic Mountains and only a few blocks from the waterfront. I was able to wander the streets and visit my old haunts (especially Belltown), but with a difference. I was able to return to the tasteful, low key cool of Hotel 1000, instead of a studio apartment with a Murphy bed in the wall (remember those?).. Now who was looking in? The staff were great: attentive, respectful, and sophisticated - no haggling over whether you had that extra bottle of sparkling water out of the mini-bar or not. The room was terrific with a bath to die for. The location of the hotel was perfect and within easy walking distance of shopping, great eateries, and the Pike Place Market.

What will bring me back again and again is...EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE HOTEL! Very easy to get to, right on a main downtown street. Despite having to actually go around the block once to wait for other guests to unload their vehicles (very limited drop off space - only two or three spots right in front of the building), the actual valet experience was fabulous. Quick, easy, courteous and streamlined - left me to enjoy my weekend rather than worry about my vehicle, parking, theft, etc. The valet fee was a little hefty above $30, but in the end, I didn't at all mind having to pay for the seamless experience. I was welcomed by luxury and fabulous treatment upon check-in with a glass of sparkling wine. Check-in was easy and I was on my way to my room - which knocked my socks off. Stunning, simple, classy yet modern luxury upon entry. Comfortable, convenient, appealing. I almost didn't want to leave the room! The bathroom was fabulous. When our plans got interrupted, we decided to check out the BOKA restaurant + bar. After 2 drinks and an appetizer, it ended up becoming our evening plans! The decor and ambiance were perfect - the atmosphere was social, warm and comfortable. As the evening progressed, dinner guests left and night life began - but it remained comfortable and social. The bartenders were wonderful - funny, charming, knowledgeable, attentive, and most importantly - knew how to mix drinks better than perhaps anyone I've ever met. The prices were as expected for a downtown hotel bar - not outrageous, but, definitely a little pricey. Again, you're downtown...everything is more expensive. Checkout was simple and to top it off, even after we checked out, we were allowed to leave our bags at the desk and leave our car in valet while we went out and enjoyed our day! No hassle! So we went to the marketplace, enjoyed the wine and cheese festival, and came back to pick up our bags and vehicle! FABULOUS, FABULOUS, FABULOUS. I don't know what else I can say about it. I won't even consider another hotel next time I come to Seattle.

The location is perfect, the rooms are nice and large, there are a restaurant and bar for when you\u2019re hungry and thirsty, and there is even a gym and spa. We used American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts to book the room, and we were upgraded to a larger room, had complimentary breakfast for two each morning, 4:00PM check out, and a $100 voucher to use at the spa. When we checked in, we were treated to glasses of champagne, which was a nice touch. We were also presented a note from the general manager welcoming us to the hotel. The lobby itself isn\u2019t very big, but there is always water in the afternoon and coffee in the morning for guests to enjoy. We were in room 802, which was a corner suite overlooking Madison Street and the back of the hotel. The room was very spacious! Windows wrapped the entire room, so there is a lot of sunlight. Towards the back of the room by the rear windows, there is a long sofa and a comfortable chair. A flat-panel TV is in the same area, and it is on a swivel bracket so you can turn the TV towards the bed if you want to watch shows from there. There is also a large desk in the room that overlooks the street. The closet space is also huge. A mini bar is located in the room, and you can make your own coffee in the morning with coffee grinds and a French press. The bathroom was pretty impressive. There is a separate shower, tub, and toilet. The tub is pretty neat because the water comes from the ceiling. Just remember to close the blinds when you\u2019re taking a bath here because people passing by on the street can definitely look in. There are two very comfortable robes in the room, and all the lotions, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are Molton Brown. The room has free Wi-Fi, so it was easy and convenient to stay connected. The turndown service is also nice. When they turn down your bed, they leave you with two pieces of chocolate that were very tasty! We had our morning breakfast in Boka, and the food was really good. Everyone raves about the truffle fries, so I requested it as a potato side with my meal. The cook obliged (since it wasn\u2019t on the menu), and it was very good! I also had the croissant French toast that was pretty good. The breakfast meal portions are big, so wake up hungry! The location is great! Pike\u2019s Market is about a 5-minute walk down 1st Avenue and the harbor is a couple of blocks down from the hotel. The only down side about the location is that it\u2019s towards the bottom of a large hill, so if you need to head inland, you have to walk up steep hills. Parking is pretty expensive here at $39 plus tax. But the valet guys are very good and fast. Each time someone got our car, we have two bottles of water with their compliments in the drink holders. We would definitely stay here again.

Not much to do on Bainbridge Island but the view of Seattle skyline was phenomenal. About $7 cab ride to catch ferry to Victoria.

We stayed at Hotel 1000 for two nights over the weekend and it was one of the best Seattle trips we've ever experienced. The location of the hotel is ideally situated in the downtown area, with only a short walk to Pike Market, the retail district, Pioneer Square, and the waterfront. The hotel staff are both pleasant & accommodating, and the suites all feel (and smell) very fresh and clean. The rooms on higher floors have views of Puget Sound, and, on a clear day, the mountains on the Olympic Peninsula. You can relax and watch the ferries go back and forth into the sunset. The beds were very comfortable, the linens were of high-quality, and the sound-proofing in the rooms was excellent-- we did not hear city noise or any of the other guests during our entire stay, thus ensuring for a very restful sleep. The soaking tubs are the largest & deepest I've ever encountered in any hotel, and they also fill from the ceiling, which is unique in itself. The hotel also has a boutique spa, with a very accommodating staff, and the spa treatments are simply divine. I would highly suggest pampering yourself with a few nights at Hotel 1000 if you are planning a trip to the Emerald City.

The tub was long and narrow and the window looked onto an adjacent building. There was an electronically operated shade, so our privacy was preserved, but not its views. Our room's furnishings all showed wear, which surprised me given the price of our room $400+, but the high quality sheets and pillows made for a wonderful night's sleep. We were provided with french press-ground coffee, which was magnificent - a clear contrast to the bland coffees provided elsewhere. The city location afforded nice shopping opportunities, and it's only a few blocks away from Pike Place Market, a \"must\" for tourists. The valets were on top of our requests and very helpful. We were here for a special anniversary and the Hotel provided a white-chocolate plaque decorated in milk chocolate with our names, which accompanied six chocolate creams. We had a very good time.

I played some holes at Pebble Beach with a friend and we ordered some beers and snacks - it was great for a rainy night when we didn't feel like leaving. The location of the hotel is perfect. One rainy night I was going out to meet a client and the valet offered to drive me in their house car. Ben (I believe that was his name), the driver, was engaging and courteous. You can walk to restaurants, the water is close by and the Fish Market is a 10 minute stroll. Next time I visit Seattle, I will look forward to coming back to Hotel 1000.", "Date": "November 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent hotel for business and leisure\u201d", "Author": "be01057", "ReviewID": "UR86093397", "Content": "This review is probably long overdue.

Booked the Luxe Guestroom (no view or suite) for $180 a night which is well below the regular price. I called to confirm 3 days before and they sent me an e-mail for pre-arrival that we could fill out and send back requesting car service from the airport or to book spa services, etc. We didn't book anything at that time, but did let them know we would be arriving early (8:30 am) and if we could check in early. We asked the best way to get from the airport to the hotel. They suggested car service for $75, taxi service at about $35 or the Link Light Rail at $5. We opted for the Light Rail. It was only a few blocks to the hotel from the station and we travel light so it was excellent and a great way to see the city (takes about an hour). Check-In ~ We arrived at 8:30 am and were not only checked in immediately, but were upgraded to a choice of rooms that Jaime took us to to check out. We were given the choice of a suite with a sitting room, but no tub or a city view corner room with a tub. I wanted the tub! We were unpacked before 9 am. Incredible! The Room ~ Room had ceiling to floor windows on 3 sides. Tons of natural light. Awesome. King bed was very comfortable with fabulous sheets. So soft. My husband loved the pillows, but I prefer a firmer one, which they sent up immediately. Sitting area with a chair, coffee table and couch (pull-out). Very comfy place to read your choice of complimentary newspapers in the morning. Desk and technology area was well-equipped with cords (iPhone, etc) if you forgot them. FREE Wifi, which is usually such a rip off when you have to pay. Laptop size safe (large enough for 13 inch, not sure about 15 inch though) and really fun options on the TV). Free local AND long distance calls. Bar, coffee area was nice. Ice in bags right outside our room in coolers rather than those loud ice machines. Bathroom was a highlight for me. Beautiful shower (enough room for 2) with a comforting shower head. Incredible 2 person bathtub that fills from the ceiling and the tap is on the wall which means no tap or spout in the way. It was really relaxing, especially with a window overlooking the city (there was a shade that lowered electronically if you wanted). Molten Brown products were nice and I appreciated the large bottles on the wall instead of those wasteful small bottles that you take home, but never use. Boka Restaurant ~ We had brunch and it was good. I loved the truffle fries! The Studio ~ Nice seats and fire to sit around. We played a game of checkers on the computer table (like a huge iPad). Spaahh ~ I had a body treatment done (Enrapture). It was relaxing and great for my skin. On par price wise with any other hotel I have had spa treatments. Virtual Golf ~ My husband did this while I had my spa treatment. He booked a tee time the day before, but may not be required. Only negative was that someone had left there young teens there and they were messing around in the second tee box. It didn't bother my husband, but when two others came to really play they wouldn't leave. More of a parenting thing than hotel thing though. They also have a Wii with an assortment of games. Library ~ Lovely room with classic books and comfy chairs. Front Desk, Housekeeping, Concierge and Overall Service ~ Early check-in and up-grade was great, thanks Jaime. Complimentary coffee and or iced tea in the lobby was welcome! Housekeeping was done promptly and wonderfully whenever we pushed to button to have our room made up. We were never bothered when we had the electronic Do Not Disturb on. Excellent recommendations for dinner and reservations made, thanks Colten and Casey. We went to Metropolitan Grill and Casey had an amazing appetizer waiting for us. Above and beyond. There was a town car to take us around downtown as a complimentary service. We are walkers so we didn't use it, but we saw others use it and they were impressed. We were there celebrating our anniversary and we came home on our first night to a note from the staff as well as a plate of superb cupcakes and Happy Anniversary to us written in chocolate on the plate. Yummy!! Check-out ~ Quick! We also used the Business center to print out our boarding passes. We walked back to the Light Rail and headed home. Overall ~ This hotel was amazing, clean, modern and service was the best I've ever experienced. Location was great for us and we walked everywhere!

To us, those are the things that really put a hotel at the top of our list. The restaurant had great drinks too.

The courtesy car is a great amenity that I took advantage of a couple times ( more on that in a sec). Anyway, it's within walking distance to Pike Market, Seattle Art Museum, and numerous pubs and restaurants. I did walk to the Space Needle one morning, but I reccomend taking a cab or the car if it's available. This is where the hotel staff went above and beyond - while in Seattle I was mugged near the SAM one night. I had to be taken to the hospital, but I was released a few hours later. I called the front desk to have them send a cab for me, but instead they sent the car. It felt like to me that the staff made my welfare a top priority. Even upon arriving home I was met with an email from the hotel making sure that I didnt forget anything, and they even offered help with any police reports regarding my incident.

Sleek modern vibe, huge flatscreen television tuned to a cool channel of rotating destinations struck the right note for my stay. Free NY Times in the morning. The bathroom was ultra modern if a bit hard-edge contemporary. I liked the downstairs restaurant but the front desk was iffy with directions to other spots. They gave me wrong directions to one request. The concierge was on top of his game and knew much more than the clerks. No pool but nice exercise room and spa. A good choice for a downtown location. And, then there is the phone system...WAY too complicated to make a simple call.

Before making my decision, I was contacted by a social media coordinator, who read my forum post asking about Hotel 1000. She gave me some insight into the hotel and even put me in touch with a manager who could take care of a concern I had. They have a policy to charge an authorization one nights charge plus $200 per night upon arrival. This is ONLY an authorization. We were going to be there 4 nights so $1000 plus seemed ridiculous. Upon check in, they only authorized for $400. We didnt even have to ask her to do it, but she accommodated us. Upon check in, the doormen were super cute and nice. Miko at the front desk was helpful, friendly and a fellow foodie so we would often touch base with her when we came and went. The concierge was excellent. Eric made reservations for us before we even got there, gave great advice, followed up with us and as a nice touch send us a free appetizer to the waterfront grill where he had recommended us to. His tip was earned:) The hotel is modern, clean, and comfortable. Our double bed room was on the 12th floor with a city view which was just fine with us. We were told they only have ONE room with double beds that faces the water view and it was taken. Its noisy only if you open the window which opens only slightly. The bathroom is amazing (yes water from the ceiling- took baths everyday). The beds are AWESOME, bar is really cool, the safe came in handy, the tv screen-savers were fun, loved the ipod deck, turn down service everyday, helpful staff 24/7 and great products in the bathroom. FREE WIFI IN THE ROOM! AGAIN, when in doubt, LOCATION. Seattle has hills like SF. Do not disregard this as it will add to the time when trying to go to Pikes place, anywhere near the water and generally the heart of downtown. We were a 5 min walk away from Pikes place, the library, the water and so much more. OUr taxi rides were never more than $10 for ANYWHERE we went. LOVED LOVED LOVED this.

Hotel 1000's website doesn't do the place justice. From the moment you step off the curb you are greeted by concierge and valet workers. They make your check-in immediate and no hassle. I reserved a city-view room with a king bed and was hoping to have a pedestal tub like the ones featured on the website. I walked downstairs and talked to the front desk and asked them politely if there was any way to get that certain room. I explained I was on my honeymoon and was really looking forward to those special rooms. They didn't even hesitate. They apologized that I wasn't in the room I wanted (It wasn't there fault!) and immediately moved all our bags to the perfect room (at no extra cost of course). They even went as far as giving us a complimentary bottle of chilled champagne and fresh chocolate covered strawberries. The rooms are immaculate and are not dirty at all. The housekeeping service does an incredible job and the condition of the hotel overall is perfect. They obviously pride themselves as being extremely professional and courteous. They abide by the old way of business; the customer is always right. Not many places still honor that. The BOKA restaurant looked very good for food, but we explored all the little \"hole-in-the-wall\" places we could find. We weren't disappointed. There was not one bad meal the entire week. We stayed for 9 days and ate at Pike's place almost every morning for fresh breakfast. The hotel is perfectly located in an area where walking anywhere is feasible. The only time we needed a taxi was going to the Space Needle and the airport. The taxi costs were very low. All in all, Hotel 1000 is a hotel where you can't go wrong. If you are worried about reserving the perfect hotel for an incredible trip, then this is your hotel.

Then they asked all about us - where we were from, what we were going to see. And one of the guys took an extraordinary amount of time speaking to us about restaurants and showing us several places on thier \"house map\", which is a great map. The room we had was wonderful! Two unique features were the nature scenes on the flat screen TV (how relaxing!) and the electronic shade in the bathroom. What a bathroom!! I felt even luckier when our friend at the front desk later told us that there would be a Spanish solo guitar player in the side bar later that night and the next night would be jazz. Does it get any better than that? NO! Also, they had a driver who took us to a local restaurant on our 2nd night. What a treat. Yeah, the hotel is pricy, but I believe, worth it.

What a wonderful experience!!!! We will definitely be coming back to stay!

Everyone was great--the doormen out front, the front desk reception, the servers in Studio 1000 (hotel lounge), the concierge, the room service staff, the golf attendant, the spa attendant...everyone had a smile on their face! It was as though they were happy to see us! What a wonderful way to spend the weekend at a hotel! The room itself is beautiful...the tub that fills from the ceiling is truly a sight to see. The sheets are extremely soft and the robes are nice as well. The bar comes fully stocked with nice wine glasses, drinking glasses and even a wine opener. The television has a few cool features. One of them is an interactive menu with options such as \"Dining,\" \"Personal Music,\" \"Movies,\" etc. It even had our name up on the screen to greet us when we first checked in. Additionally, there are a variety of scenic views to choose from (which is basically a still video of a landscape with relaxing music in the background). We underestimated the power of this as both of us fell asleep to the soothing sounds of the waves and the view of the beach in Mexico! HBO is included in the room and they have a decent selection of pay-per-view movies. We only entered one issue during our stay, but that issue was resolved efficiently so we have no complaints!!! When we first checked into our room, the screen in between the bathroom and the bedroom area didn't work. We told our bellman and someone at the front desk and they said they would have an engineer up to look at it right away. When we came back about an hour later, it still wasn't fixed. We went downstairs and explained that it still wasn't fixed. They immediately gave us the room next door. The Studio 1000 lounge is wonderful. I can't say enough about it. It's a small, intimate setting with delicious food (the grilled cheese and tomato soup is to die for!) and an amazing wait staff! If you can get a seat around the fire, all the better...but the surrounding chairs are comfortable as well. We could not have asked for better service! One quick example...we went downstairs to Studio 1000 looking forward to cozying up next to the fire, ordering a glass of wine and a few appetizers. When we arrived, we were disappointed to find that there were no more seats available in the small space. Immediately, the manager sugegsted an area where we could wait while he rustled up some chairs (from a different location) so we could sit. He came back right away with two comfortable chairs and placed us right up near the fire. Following our drinks and appetizers, he suggested a few seafood restaurants in the area that we might like to try. The following evening when we went back, he remembered both of our names. It's small details like that that truly make one's stay memorable. The location of the hotel is also great. It's very close to Pike Place Market.

I especially enjoyed the 'business center' with the free internet service as this was a very nice touch. The room was beautiful and comfortable and luxurious. The bathroom amenities and quality soaps were a nice touch. The only negatives really is a common complaint I have with fancy hotels. The more expensive they are the more they charge for the little things that you normally receive at a 3* hotel. Water is $4 a bottle, there is no complimentary shuttle to/from the airport, there is no continental breafast. We stayed at a Portland hotel earlier that truly impressed us because of these little things (as well as their large, comfortable, clean and affordable room). I might sound picky but your average business 3* hotel will give you these basic amenties, but when a hotel like the Hotel 1000 is charging $250-400 a night, seriously why charge for water? Do they really need that extra $4? Why not offer some basic pastries for breakfast? Isn't there enough profit to be made on the room charge itself. Perhaps the main thing that would keep me from staying here is the location. Yes, it's only about a 10-15 min walk to the fish market and to shopping, it would be a lot for a family and it was especially far at night.

Either the hotel management does an excellent job of training the staff to cater to its customers or they just are fortunate to hire caring employees who truly enjoy their jobs and want the traveler to have a good experience. The concierges and young valet staff were especially helpful in making recommendations and providing fast service.

It was a surprise upon opening the hotel door to be greeted with uplifting classical music and slides of paintings on the television screen. After a hectic airplane ride it was just what we needed.

The car is whisked off, and you don't need to worry about it until you need it again.

Our room was on the 10th floor with a view of the ferries and cargo ships coming and going; actually the action on the water was more fascinating than the TV.... Not that there was anything wrong with the TV (large plasma screen mounted on wall), I just have a problem with the abundance of 'medical product' advertising on US cable channels. Now - as for the room itself - it was beautiful. We had a kingsize bed with crisp linens, lovely glassware, french press coffee maker, beautiful classy decor all in a well thought out room design.

A deep free standing tub equipped with Molton Brown toiletries, that filled from a hole in the ceiling.... not terribly practical if you want to top up with hot water if you are already in the tub, but a lovely design feature nonetheless.

We were greeted by name on arrival. We were just a mom and daughter on a vacation together. Everyone new my name even the bellmen and all concierge. We stayed in luxury hotels our entire trip, and this one was our favorite. We were there June 21-23 and June 27-30. The bathtub is great for soaking. Molton Brown products are in dispensers in the shower, and in small personal bottles for the tub, so you have plenty of product during your stay. The towels are great; I asked for extra ones without a problem. The room and bathroom decorations are very nice. The makeup mirror and vanity area are all nice. The cabinet area and garment bag closets were a nice wood with the decor and provided plenty of storage space. An ironing board and iron were provided. A small bar area has wine, Tazo tea, and a French press with Starbucks coffee in a sealed canister. It was resupplied each day. We had planned to stay in another part of Seattle after returning from Canada, before heading home, but we cancelled and rebooked Hotel 1000 to finish out our stay. We were on the 12th and 8th floors. The room was very clean, and I am picky. No dirty glasses as in other reviews. I heard some ambulance and heavy truck street noise on the 8th floor, but it did not ruin a night's sleep. I preferred the 12th. I had heard about street noise in early reviews. We were celebrating my daughter graduating with her Masters from USC, and I wanted her trip to be perfect. These are the things I asked for and was granted without a problem. I requested a high floor away from street noise when first booking the hotel. I was given a complimentary upgrade to a city view to honor our celebration. Both times we stayed, I asked for a AAA discount; I was given it even on the Luxe room. I paid $207 a night. I used the hotel website and reservation line, but I found calling the hotel directly and making my reservation helped prevent some arrival potential problems. The cheif concierge, Joan, helped me get a cake made by the hotel pastry chef in my daughter' s favorite flavors. It was delivered by room service with extra thoughtfulness. They timed the cake arrival for our return after dinner. Joan is very sweet and very professional. The hotel town-car service is a separate business. We had baggage claim pickup at Sea-Tac. The driver Peter was excellent. We appreciated not having to drag our luggage; he took it all even though drivers can no longer park at the curb, but it was a short walk over the skybridge right into his waiting car. It was the only time on the trip other than at the hotel that we had such great service. It was $80.00 for baggage pickup, including tip. 70.00 for the return to the airport. He took a route that avoided traffic, so it was really worth it. He had a sign with my name, and he notified the hotel that we were arriving. Our room was ready when we went to the front desk. A pre-arrival form is sent three days before arrival, if you provide your email address with your reservation. I put in our arrival time and any special requests on this form. I think it makes a difference in letting the hotel know when your arriving. We arrived early, but I asked for them to hold our bags since we were arriving about 2 pm, but we didn't have to wait. The phone and television were what I expected from the hotel web site. Both tv and phone displayed my name, and the tv was playing art scenes when we walked in; I had asked about the art museum at the front desk upon check-in. Long distance and local calls are free with the internet phone system. Upon calling guest service, I received prompt help with extra towels, information, and room service. The fresh berries and Devonshire cream were wonderful. It was berry season, so they were extra fresh. All the room service food was very good. We had no problems using the electronic make-up room or privacy signs. No-one entered the room as noted in some other reviews. A cleaning person did leave a Red-Bull out of the bar. I took it with me when I checked out to show that I had not consumed it. The smart mini-fridge does tell them if anything is missing. They took it off my bill immediately without a problem. One problem, I ran into was gypsy taxis and towncars in Seattle. Orange and green taxis do not have meters and are not legally suppose to stop when flagged, but even if you are flagging yellow cab they try to stop. One driver tried to scam me, but I had enough taxi savy to not fall for it. At the hotel, for our return to the airport, I tried to book our driver directly. It turns out a gypsy company has adopted the name of a family company that has been in business 12 years. They took off a \"d\" from the end of the name. The good company is Advanced Limosine. I got suspicious from a couple of comments made when I was confirming my reservation. I asked the hotel concierge to confirm by reservation with Peter. She did. Peter arrived promptly. But, a gypsy town car service arrived as well. The driver made a big scene outside. The concierge came to worn me what was happening. The bell man, our driver, and even the hotel management came out to protect us from this driver who had pretended to me that he was sending Peter, who had picked us up at the airport, to to return us to the airport. We saw this happen at the Amtrack station on our return from Canada, as well. A gypsy limosine driver was trying to pick-up new arrivals. From now on, I will let the hotel make our transportation arrangements.

After reading some of the reviews listed here, I would agree there are a few areas that needed work, but the overall the excellent service made the small things seem like nothing. Not a single detail was spared while making our Anniversary the best it could be. The Bad: 1.) Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, they said they would call our cell phone when it was ready- no call The Good: 1.) Even though our room wasn't ready they upgraded us to the 14th Floor (highest level), rewarded us with a bottle of champagne, fresh strawberries, and a hand written letter wishing us a Happy Anniversary! VERY KIND 2.) I had arranged to have a cake dropped off replicating that of our wedding day. They did a fantastic job arranging and presenting it. 3.) BOKA KITCHEN: AMAZING We made our dinner reservations for 8pm, when we arrived our table wasn't ready so we decided to grab a delicious drink at the bar: Frost (which is rosemary infused Vodka with Pom juice...YUMMO) Who would have thought Rosemary in Vodka? We had a nice visit over our drink, our hostess sat us 15 minutes later, apologizing profusely. Only to find out she sent out (2) appetizers as a thank you for being patient. We nibbled on the Sugar Cane Skewered Crab Cakes (Delicious) and the BBQ Beef Sliders (Tasty). We each had a flight of wine (Great Selections) shared a salad and Asparagas Spears (not so great). I had the Lamb for dinner which paired nicely with my flight of red wine from French Region (Cotes Du Rhone), my husband had the roasted chicken with white wine. They even put together some ice cream for us to take to eat with our wedding cake! Great service, excellent staff, can't wait to go back. 4) We brought our dog Lola, she is 24lb Puggle and is all love and licks. They completely spoiled her by bringing a large dog bed, two bowls, doggie treats, a large bone, and a toy for her to play with. They offered to walk her, but she was pooped from a long day of sight seeing in Seattle. Overall everything was perfect. Very swanky, I loved all the little details.

The hotel has town car drop off service, they fail to tell you this at check in. 3. Our room was not vacuumed and the carpet was dirty. Upon complaint they vacuumed promptly. 4. The TV turns off by itself to reboot the system. This happens often. 5. They don't seem to have a laundry service. 6. For a so called 5 star hotel - there is no shoe mitt or buff, no envelopes or stationary in the room, no slippers, and the hotel directory is short on information. 7. Room service prices are inaccurate, while it is not listed anywhere in the menu book they add large service charges and delivery fees. Not unusual but notice is a good thing. 8. The valet did not know what parking costs. For $400-500 or so a night Hotel 1000 does not deliver real value or stellar service.

He was in Seattle for work, and I tagged along to hang out and explore the city. I also brought a day or two of work with me. I was looking forward to seeing the hotel because I heard that David Beckham stayed there a few months ago. We were upgraded to a huge suite, so of course I was able to fantasize that maybe I was sleeping in the SAME BED that David Beckham once slept in! Me, my husband, and the aura of David Beckham, all in that big comfy bed. The bedroom was bigger than our bedroom at home; the bathroom was bigger than our bathroom at home; and the living room was bigger than our living room at home. We even had a dining table that was - you guessed it - bigger than our dining table at home. There were two flat screen TVs, including one in the bedroom, and my husband looooved that. The furnishings were comfortable and I loved the Molten Brown toiletries. I took a couple baths in the neat-o tub and I enjoyed the separate shower with two showerheads. Local and long distance calls were free, and there was free internet access in the living room (either through Wi Fi or a cable that they provide to connect your laptop to the jack in the wall). My only complaint was that the Wi Fi stopped working 3 days into our stay, and the cable was very short. So to use my computer, I had to either sit in an armchair with the laptop balanced on the arm, or sit on the floor with the laptop on the very low coffee table. This was uncomfortable and my legs would cramp up very quickly. The workspace options should be better thought out; I would have loved it if the cable had reached the dining table so that I could have worked there. The location of the hotel is terrific. Just a short stroll to Pike Place Market in one direction, and a short stroll to Pioneer Square in the other. The front desk service was excellent, but I had a few negative experiences with housekeeping. For example, they did not really clean the shower stall. I have thick hair and it was disgusting to watch the hair collect on the drain cover. I know I could have easily cleaned it myself, but I wanted to see how long it would be before they actually cleaned the shower. After a couple more days I had to clean it myself because the water would no longer drain. This was gross, but I consoled myself with the thought that maybe some of David Beckham's hairs were still in the shower, too. On another day, I was in the room working and I had the \"Do Not Disturb\" light on. Suddenly the door opened and a housecleaner came into the room. She didn't knock or announce herself at all. She seemed genuinely surprised to see me, but not as surprised as I was. I asked her why she came in when the \"Do Not Disturb\" light was on, and she said it was because she thought we had checked out that day. I said,\"'Even if you thought we had checked out, when you saw the 'Do Not Disturb' light on, why didn't you knock or announce yourself?\" She just apologized repeatedly and left. So that did not make me feel great about hotel security. What if she had come in while I was taking a bath, or in bed with the aura of David Beckham? Thank heaven I was just working. A couple other notes: The gym in the basement is small, but I liked that it was stocked with towels and bottled water. The free strawberry lemonade in the lobby is really tasty and my husband had a glass every day. Our room was huge, but very dark. If natural light is important to you, ask for a room with larger or more windows.

My first morning at the hotel, I entered the granite shower with 2 showerheads trying to figure out how to turn the 2 faucets on without getting soaked in cold water, for the knobs were at the far end of the shower and there was no way of avoiding the spray. That was the least of my problems because after I recovered from the ice bath, followed by the scorching heat of the hard-to-adjust temperature setting I realized that there is absolutely no water pressure. There was barely any water trickling out of the shower heads which made it impossible to rinse. Second shock? While fiddling with the temperature knob, I pulled off a wad of someone\u2019s hair on my hand. Minutes later I noticed more foreign hair on the shower walls, Gross! After 10 minutes of trying to rinse unsuccessfully, I decided to just rinse my hair in the sink (which became my daily routine for the next 5 days). There is absolutely no water pressure at all. The next day, I decided to give the soaking tub a try. My first attempt to fill the tub, produced a tub full of dirty sudsy water- apparently they never rinsed it off from the previous guest, so I set out to clean the tub myself. On my 3rd attempt to fill the tub, I noticed that my bath bubbles were gray and dirty. My next grievance is that for such a large bathroom, they give you only one tiny piece of soap (the size of a silver dollar), which you have to carry from the shower, to the sink, to the tub. After 6 days at this hotel, it was never refilled with a new one. While I admire the city\u2019s commitment to conserving water, a functioning shower and a bar of soap are a must for a decent hotel.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201cWorth the Money\u201d", "Author": "Luv2travel087", "ReviewID": "UR14070189", "Content": "My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel 1000 for three nights and it was definitely an experience to remember! This hotel is considered a \"four star\" hotel, but we both felt that it could easily be a \"five star.\" First off, the hotel ambiance is extremelly relaxing and peaceful. It is somewhat dark inside and decorated with darker hues, but in a way that is very calming. The rooms are absolutely unbelievable. We had a king waterview and though we paid a little more for the view, the windows were huge and gave us a great view of the Sound. There were also lots of nice touches like a flat screen that is personalized during your stay, a great bed with nice linens and lots of storage space. The room was a little small, but more than adequate for us! The bathroom is to die for - I would love to have a duplicate made for my home! Secondly, the food at the hotel is wonderful - we ate at the restaurant once and had an excellent meal and they have a really nice happy hour each evening in front of the fire that we enjoyed every night we were there. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating and we were sorry to leave them at the end of our stay! We did not use the Spaah services but we did play virtual golf, which was a lot of fun - I would recommend it if you find yourself with an extra hour or so. We would return to the Hotel 1000 in a hot second - there is no where else we would stay in Seattle and we did our fair share of checking out some of the other hotels we were looking at. (Hotel Monaco, Hotel Vintage Park, Edgewater, etc.) - none even compared in our opinion. The location is also one of the best you can ask for in the city! If you get the chance and can afford it, definitely stay at this hotel - it will make your Seattle experience even better!", "Date": "March 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutey perfect time at Hotel 1000!\u201d", "Author": "forzuto13", "ReviewID": "UR13180881", "Content": "I stayed here at the Hotel 1000 for eleven nights while in Seattle for some govt. training. The Jackson Federal Building is conveniently located right across the street from the hotel. When I first called the guest relations rep I was told that I couldn't get the govt. rate for dates listed but the lady was able to confirm me and took also my requests for a king bed, quiet location and the infamous bathtub that fills from the ceiling. Upon check-in I was told that they were able to honor my request with a complimentary upgrade. The room was on the 12th floor and was nothing less than perfect! When I first entered I found the 40 \" flat-screen HD TV (mounted on the wall) playing some relaxing classical music along with a selected program offering Renaissance art. You can play different themed programs. My favorite was the \"1000 Places to Visit Before You Die.\" The room is nicely decorated in a subdued Asian theme, with dark floors, bamboo, blue and maroon walls. The king-sized bed was super comfortable, with nice feather pillows. The room itself was spacious and a had a large desk with lamp. The services there are extremely good. There is free long distance phone calling from the rooms and the business office. There are two computers with free internet. I was usually the only person in the room at any time. There is a really cool library located on the fourth floor that has nice comfy chairs and a fire place and you can choose the same music programs that are in each of the rooms. My friend and I went there one evening with a bottle of wine, dimmed the lights, put on the classical music, and had a very pleasant evening. There is a decent gym, although a little small in size. Still it has two elliptical trainers and treadmills. Free weights up to 50 lbs and three different fixed machines for shoulders, legs and back/triceps. There is a spa with services next to the gym and also a golfing simulator. Parking is availabe in garage and was for guests only when I was there. It can be pricey, however. The entire staff there was always very accomodating and friendly. Most are pretty young, but all very eager to assist you and always greeting you upon entering and leaving. The room service provides you with free Starbucks coffee to brew in the french presses that are in the rooms. I requested a refridgerator be brought up to my room so I could keep some food in their during my stay. What's also great is that the hotel is downtown and there are several happy hour offers nearby where you can get cheap appetizers and drinks. The hotel bar/restaurant has their own happy hour from 4-6 pm. I would always go to this place, called Contour, that was south on First Ave a block and a half. They have one of the latest happy hours around, lasting from 3 to 8 pm every day! Try the provolone cheeseburgers and lamb kebabs. Each only $1.95 at the time of my stay. Later the place become a club. The hotel is near Pier 54, where the famed Ivar's is (good for fish and chips with yummy tartar sauce!), and also close to Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, Benaroya Symphony Hall and the Triple Door jazz club. Most things are within walking distance. Try Cafe Zum Zum for a cheap lunch. Pakistani food - various curries over basmati rice for around six bucks. We also went to Cafe Denunzio one evening. The dining room is charmingly decorated, and Tonnino, our server, was really nice. The food was pretty good but the was pretty blah. So you can see I was totally impressed with my stay at the Hotel 1000 in the Emerald City! Nothing short of perfect, actually. The cool thing about this hotel is it's size. I mean it's just big enough to have all the accomodations but also small enough to be intimate and not impersonal, like some of the big chain hotels. I highly recommend this place for anyone. Maybe not so much for big families with kids, but for sure for couples, seniors, and business people.

All the rooms are ultra-modern and feature plasma televisions, complementary internet, and even a bathtub that fills from the ceiling.

They also have a nice and small but functional business center and a fully-equipped workout center free of charge. The minibar is also fairly inexpensive. I will admit that it's not the most affordable but to be right downtown and a short walk from Pike Place, anything decent is going to be expensive. The only issue I had during the stay is how expensive and disorganized the room service was. Not only were the food prices expensive (to be expected anyway I guess), but there two different unexplained service charges on the bill also and that didn't include tax or gratuity.... I'm very used to having an automatic gratuity on the bill and I assumed that it was included in one of the service charges, however it was explained to me by the valet (which is who they have deliver the food apparently) that it is not so I also had to tip him. For a late night snack of a shrimp cocktail and a bowl of soup I think I ended up paying about $35.00 overall. The breakfast costed roughly the same and it was also somewhat disappointing. So, overall I was very pleased with the amenities, cleanliness, and luxury of Hotel 1000 and would definitely stay there again no question. Being that room service was the only part that was lacking, I just won't order it next time, not a big deal.

The decor is modern with an Asian twist - very nicely done and attractive. The location was perfect - Seattle is a very walkable city and we were able to walk to the market, pioneer square, Safeco field, resteraunts and many other places form here. Many times we would pop back into the hotel on our way to something else just to take a quick rest and set off again. Which was FAB! The service was wonderful - very friendly staff - made us reservations for dinner, showed us where to go fo glass blowing, underground tour, breakfast ect.. ect...

The hotel is not kid friendly but we enjoyed it anyway. We asked the front desk for a simple dinner spot and she suggested Quiznos sub shop! I am not sure if they are used to seeing kids. We were able to walk down to Pike Street and shops and restaurants are nearby. We did not find our room dark, but the weather was bright and sunny and we had our curtains wide open.

I had booked this hotel because of its location, but also because it advertised a bathtub that filled from the ceiling, which I knew my daughter would get a big kick out of. While it's obviously not a hotel that caters to families with small children, we had an excellent experience. The room was very well decorated, if a little masculine, and the bathroom was the best I've ever been in (in terms of size, awesome bathtub, and general design). The service was amazing--we ordered a fruit salad from room service at 10pm, and it was delivered within 15 minutes! We ate off the bar menu at the restaurant for a late lunch one day, and I was not terribly impressed--everything was very salty (maybe because it's bar food?). My only complaints: the refrigerator/bar area was very swanky and it actually looked like you could mix a cocktail or two with the supplies provided (they also had several different types of glasses available!). Anyway, the complaint is that everything in the bar and refrigerator is weight-sensitive, so it was impossible to store anything we brought with us. Second, the bottled water was not complimentary--a minor complaint, but this is a very expensive hotel, so I thought it would be a nice thing to do.", "Date": "July 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cWeak Wannabe...\u201d", "Author": "NilsStCyr", "ReviewID": "UR8230065", "Content": "Great facility.

We stayed on the 8th floor and did not hear any street noise at all. The room service menu is wonderful, as well as the late night happy hour menu (10PM-midnight) at BOKA, the hotel's restaurant. During happy hour, all small plates are half price, giving us a chance to try a little of everything. The fitness center is more well equipped than most boutique hotels, and features 2 elliptical trainers and 2 treadmills (all with built in TVs), as well as a few weight machines and free weights.

I needed to make a fast trip to Seattle to renew my passport, and found this hotel right across the streed from the federal building. If you like an elegant, quiet, nice hotel with outstanding staff, this is the place for you. The lobby is really quite beautiful, with subdued lighting, no musack, quiet elegance, and a staff whose response to every one of my queries was \"no problem.\" The room was a knock out with original art and sculpture, large screen plasma tv, outstanding free internet, fand ree long distance calls.The bed was superb, with goose down quilts and wonderful designer lighting. I had a deluxe room on the 10th floor, and the writing desk for work was one of the best I have ever seen in a hotel. The bathroom had top designer fixtures, a nice view over Seattle, and a tub which fills from the ceiling! The only bathroom I have seen that compares in the Okura in Tokyo or perhaps the Amangani, The breakfast buffet is really nice- thick linen table cloths, a small fire in the center of the room surrounded by Japanese river rocks. They served muffins, , proscuttiio, vanilla and banana pancakes with real maple syrup, parfaits with fresh berries, freshly squozen orange juice, hot oatmeal and all of this on a small two meter long table. The breakfast area is quiet with earth muted tones in design. The waiter even let me see the container of 100% maple syrup (I have an allergy to artifical maple flavor) so didn't have to worry.. They gave me a free extended checkout, stored my luggage for ne, sent a staff member into the street to flag down a cab to the airport, and did whatever they could to make my visit as pleasant as possible. I log about 150k air miles a year and stay at a lot of hotels around the world, particularly in Asia. Hotel 1000 is one of the nicest I have stayed at any price,. I have stayed at the Seattle Four Seasons and I think Hotel 1000 is nicer. In fact, I want to take my famly back there just to see the quiet elegant design of the Hotel 1000.
