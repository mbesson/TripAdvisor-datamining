It is about 15 minutes from the Reichstag, the Brandenburg Gates and the Memorial to the Holocaust. We booked a Junior suite for three nights and we were a little disappointed when we got to our room. It was very small for a suite and only provided one easy chair! However, it was spotlessly clean and the bed was comfortable. The room we had (525) was initially quiet - as we had requested - however, at 1.30am we were awakened by very loud noises. Someone was moving furniture around and this lasted for around 2 hours. We thought it must be the guest in the room above us. The following night we were awakened at 1.30am again. This time by a machine - sounded like a floor polisher - my husband rang down to reception to ask what was going on. We were told that they had arranged night cleaners to come in and clean the wellness centre above us!!! We were actually quite shocked by this. After all we had requested a quiet room, and above all things needed a good night's sleep. We changed rooms the next day to 425 which was an improvement. The hotel handled our complaint very efficiently, and apologised by delivering some macaroons to our room. However, this was a much needed break for us and it was spoiled. I question why the management felt the need to employ cleaners who use machines and move furniture at that time of night. What are they thinking about - obviously their procedures come before guest needs. We ate at the restaurant on the first night after having some dreadful cocktails in the bar. I had a warm, syrupy cosmopolitan which was truly dreadful. We were the only guests in the restaurant!! However, we did have a wonderful bottle of Merlot and the food was actually quite good. Our waiter seemed delighted to have some guests and was very efficient. It seems a shame that the hotel do not promote the restaurant better. No-one asked us on check in if they could make a booking for us and there was no sample menu in the room - I think they are losing revenue by not doing this.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cCould do better\u201d", "Author": "murfs1", "ReviewID": "UR125400893", "Content": "It is a modern hotel in an excellent location, but would be ideal, well for us,if the floors were a little more welcoming, no pictures or colour,coffee & tea making facilities in the room, better pillows,duvets,storage and at least one more english channel on the TV also the shower could have been designed better, firstly a bigger shower screen and with out the pop up and down plug as you will find yourself either stubbing your toe on it or constantly stepping on it,also no bath robes or slippers the reason we are highlighting all of these is that we have stayed in lower star hotels than this one and got all of the above! we can not fault the breakfast as it very good.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cPerfect sleep and fantastic mattress\u201d", "Author": "travelgay", "ReviewID": "UR124939307", "Content": "Loved the quality of the bed, very comfortable mattress (hard).

The hotel is situated just far enough from the major tourist sites to be quiet and relaxed, but near enough to walk to some of them, and close enough to all forms of public transport to make access trivial. Check in was very efficient, and we were given a large, airy room. The shower is huge and the quality of the fittings is very high, as are the usual consumables.

Breakfast is a delight, with as much choice as anyone might want, although it can become a little chaotic at times when tour groups are rushing to set out for the day. My one real criticism is the bar. It is extremely well furnished and comfortable, but the policy seem to be to leave one poor girl to cope with large groups and at one point we couldn\u2019t get served for 25 minutes despite being leant on the bar itself!

Finally, the price was quite reasonable for a hotel of this quality and in this location on the marathon weekend. If you are driving, just be aware there is no place off the street to unload - just pull up at the front door for check-in. Also, it might be best to let the hotel know that you are driving and that you would like a spot in their garage if possible.

We did not have breakfast included in our package and opted on a couple mornings for the continental breakfast in the bar area. It was not fancy but the food and coffee were very good.

Whenever we needed something or had a question, it was acknowledged and done quickly. Never did we need to make a second call (because the staff listen and remember, that's so important). And yes, they all speak perfect English! The hotel itself is modern and clean. It is located in a quiet residential/government offices area, which is safe and a perfect place to go back to after a busy day exploring the city. U-Bahn is just 3mins walk away, so you can easily reach all destinations which are not at your door-step already (ie. Museum Island, Gendarmenmarkt, Unter den Linden, Friedrichstrasse). There are many good restaurants within walking distance (from causal to Micheline Star) , if you want to try something else than the hotel's own. Our room was big and bright, and everything we needed were at hand (very impressed at how clean and calcaire-free the coffee pot was, and the bathroom was just spic n' span). Air-cond, TV, DVD Player, Cordless Phone and Mini-Fridge all worked well, and the fresh apples in the room kept the doctor away! Did not have a chance to use the sauna and gym, but peeked inside and they looked decent and clean. Little improvement could be made, if there are more shelves/drawers for placing sweaters and scarves. Bed was top-quality, but the pillows were a little flimsy for my liking. Last but not least, we came back late on a Sunday (also my birthday), and found courtesy from the Chef, a lovely Strawberry Birthday Cake and from the Assistant Front Office Manager, a Birthday Greeting Card in our room.

We booked ahere at the last minute in desperation after a disastrous stay in another hotel (part of a gift) for the first night of our Berlin visit. When we arrived at reception, looking battered, bedraggled and sorry for ourselves at 9 am, ready to leave our bags in their storage and explore Berlin, they took pity on us and not only let us check in early, but also upgraded our room a class. The rooms themselves are very 'design hotel' - clean clear lines, lots of light and everything is fluidly sophisticated. Our room had a sofa and a rocking chair, in addition to the bed as well as the desk area with plugs etc/LAN connection all framed by a huge picture window with a view of the church. The rocking chair is great - you can imagine John F or indeed Bill C in this chair getting up to no good! The minibar is reasonably priced and includes things like a sightseeing kit (cool compress eye mask) a condom set (this is Berlin!), chocolates etc. The minibar fridge is also big enough to put your own things in it as well if you like. The bathroom is well appointed with miniatures as well as soap dispensers for those who prefer to be green and don't like the minis. There are a couple of apples in the room as a welcome gift with the tea and coffee tray, which was very welcome. The bed itself is very big, and in usual German style is two singles beside each other each with their own bedding. I know lots of people find this odd, but I have to say my partner and I both sleep better in German beds than in our own bed - no fighting over the covers! TV has mostly German channels with BBC and CNN, but there is a DVD player and you can check out DVDs from the reception library free of charge. I was ill on our last night and we did this and it was great! Didn't check out the fitness centre or spa, or the library with it's computer terminals, but we would have done if we had been there longer. We also didn't use the restaurant. Behind the church in front of the hotel you can see the Museumsinsel. If you exit the hotel and turn left within two hundred metres you are at Gendarmermarkt. If you turn right and walk along the Franzoichestrasse you will eventually come to the Nikolaikirche and the Alexanderplatz. If you walk straight on alongside the church you will come to Unter den Linden and eventually to the Brandenburg Gate. You can see the Museumsinsel from the hotel. Behind the hotel is a U-bahn stop and a restaurant, Chipps, where we had a great breakfast. Just at the back of the hotel near the U-bahn there's a tabac where you can get English language papers. You can rent bikes at the hotel or at the tabac. The location of this hotel is perfect for pretty much everything and you'll have a great experience of Berlin using the John F as a base. We liked this hotel very much, but were especially appreciative of the welcome we received from the ladies on the front desk when we arrived in the morning after our disastrous experience at the other hotel.

The hotel was chosen for its proximity to the conference venue and also for the fact that it was close to many of Berlin's city centre attractions. We were made to feel most welcome at all times - and our limited knowledge of the language was never a problem with any of the staff. Our room was very spacious and always spotlessly maintained. We loved the huge shower - with its very non-slip tiling. Toiletries are supplied. Should we have needed it, I believe that any reasonable Internet access would not have been charged for, though there were 4 free computer terminals in the lobby area also. We had the Continental breakfast every morning - at 7.50 Euros it was the least expensive option, and was more than adequate. It included fruit juice, coffee, fresh rolls , cheese and cold meats, and croissants. A bus went right past the front door, and went to one of the main train stations, though a daily bus ticket at 6.80 Euros would connect you to many areas of the city using other bus connections. We were only a short walking distance from the routes of the Open Top buses that do the usual round trips. There is a fitness centre - though we did not use it.

We also liked the bathroom: we prefer a good shower, like the one on offer, over a bath. Finally, the room had a dedicated fridge (separate from the mini-bar) which was a nice touch. The only odd thing about the room was a rather useless kitchenette: a stove top, but no microwave, pots or pans, cooking utensils, cutlery or crockery. This space would be more useful as additional wardrobe space: the existing wardrobe was smallish for a 4-night stay for two people. Our rate included breakfast.

Due to the location of the hotel there are no obvious \"outside\" breakfast options in the immediate vicinity. Hotel staff were efficient and friendly. The location of the hotel is more or less in an office area, next door to the foreign office buildings.

If eating out i would recommend Andy's bar and dinner which did some excellent food. The hotel is also on a bus route 147. You can purchase day ticket for 6.10 euros and get on and off as many buses that day in are A and B. The best bus route are 100 and 200 which take you to most attractions. This is on Unter Den Linden. It is also a few minutes from U-bahn but we used the buses.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Hotel in what I believe is the nicest part of Berlin\u201d", "Author": "TLocantro", "ReviewID": "UR71097753", "Content": "We were looking for a fairly short stay in Berlin to cater for the Pearl Jam concert and were focussed on a more modern hotel. The Arcotel John F exceeded our expectations on a number of fronts. Firstly the negative aspects included, no iron/board in the room (however these can be requested through reception). My best advice would be to seek an iron and board during check in if required. Now normally German engineering is so meticulous it is ridiculous, however the shower without a screen and design threw water all over the bathroom when it hits the occupant in the shower. Just ensure you put plenty of towels down before embarking inside. Other than that the shower is superb! The room is ultra modern, ultra clean and has a small kitchenette although there are no pots and pans in the room. There is a small food store down the road for your supplies (leave via the side exit for easy access) and it is of the gourmet variety. Flat screen TV's are great, the bed super comfortable and the whole \"vibe\" of the room matches the city. The rooms offer temperature control which I feel is paramount to enjoying your stay. I loved the carpet which had the names of tourist destinations and was again in earthy tones and suited the hotel and city perfectly. Now where this hotel really excells is if you walk out the main entrance and head left, I believe you are in the nicest part of Berlin, with the dining options in the main areas, wide streets, beautiful earthy tones and funky shops in the immediate vicinity. You also are very close to Lafayette and the U barn is a very easy walk. The hotel was extremely well priced, with a decent bar that provided screens for our viewing of various world cup games. Breakfast options are available and are fairly priced. The staff were helpful, very well presented and professional in all dealings with them. Those with internet withdrawls would be pleased to note that there are four workstations near the main bar area and access is free for hotel patrons. That area is used for conventions and seminars so at times there could be some traffic, but I never experienced any issues with getting a computer. I intend to stay at this hotel on my return to this wonderful city, and in fact I believe it was staying at this hotel and getting used to its location that enhanced my view in the first place.

I can highly recomend this hotel.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Arcotel John F", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1218768-Reviews-Arcotel_John_F-Berlin.html", "Price": "$112 - $282*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Werderscher Markt 11</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10117</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1218768", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/85/1e/851eae667c58e3b7061a99892eaa88ba3large.jpg"}}
