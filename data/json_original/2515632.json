I travel frequently for work so I have stayed at many top hotels and resorts frequently (as a top Marriott / Starwood rewards member), but Rancho Bernardo Inn stands out in my mind as one of the top places I have had the pleasure to stay at. The lobby area is very cozy and quaint, and the rooms are simply stunning. There are plenty of marble counter tops and great wood shutters, all the better to enjoy the very cozy room or to open up and enjoy the stunning views of the golf course. I telecommute for work so I needed a high speed internet connection to attend remote webex meetings and phone calls. The internet connection is blazingly fast, far faster than my Marriott / Westin hotels I frequent. The staff is second to none. Everyone is so friendly and warm, and every where I walked (all over the property), I felt completely at home, with all of my needs and wants met. I also enjoyed the spa facilities, and I did not want to leave the facilities at the end of the day. The spa staff is fantastic, and they really made sure I had every need met. Not only did I enjoy the deep tissue massage, but I also loved the indoor and outdoor jacuzzi and pool areas as well. This was my first stay at RBI, and I really didn't know what to expect since it's so unique and different from my usual Marriott / Starwood stays. Simply put the staff, the hotel, the golf course and scenery, the food, the spa blew me away. I loved my stay so much I was actually very sad to leave and check out. I will definitely be back and would highly recommend this resort to any of my friends / family for a relaxing week / weekend, or for business meetings / work. If you are looking to stay here, take it from a top road-warrior, I love this property, and so will you.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Encinitas, California", "Title": "\u201cAn Ideal San Diego Getaway Destination\u201d", "Author": "MBWest6", "ReviewID": "UR128655726", "Content": "We live in San Diego and the kids, all 4, had their own getaways one certain weekend. This never happens! My husband and I were looking for a getaway that we could get to easily on a Friday afternoon in the crazy commute that wouldn't take an eternity. I'd never been to the RBI and the website looked inviting. I phoned and got a fabulous spa package. The property was sold out when we arrived Friday and we were put in the Fountain Building on the 3rd floor above the A/C unit. During the day its fine when you close your door but at night you hear the roar of the fan circulating. This was over our A/C unit in the room which itself was very loud. It did stop working our Saturday night stay. Thankfully we were on the 3rd floor and able to sleep with our screen door open. And thankfully our bed was remarkably comfortable. The spa is lovely and I was given a wonderful massage by Sherry. The ladies working in the spa were gracious and welcoming. The steam/ jacuzzi area need a bit more care. There were washcloths to wipe your face, in a bowl, but with no ice. All the trash cans were overflowing. The spa pool was remarkably relaxing. There too the bar ladies were kind and expedient. I have to say overall the service at this property, from Paul in reservations, to Paul and Camille in the restaurant, really everywhere you went, the employees there seem to enjoy their work. While the property itself needs renovating, the grounds and employees make it a welcoming getaway for anyone who just needs a break.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Rafael, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful oasis, top notch service\u201d", "Author": "colomonica", "ReviewID": "UR128618784", "Content": "Stayed here for a business meeting.

A bit of modesty could help this place have a reality check. This place was probably nice when it opened, but it just looks tired and dated now. The website, advertising and photography portray a false image of this property as a high end luxury resort. For the price (even though I booked on points) and cost of their restaurant, this place just doesn't cut it. I stay in all types of places in and outside of the US for business so I'm really not that picky and try not to rate a place based on age, especially if certain items are updated and they keep the property clean. However I found that this place was just worn down. The landscaping is abundant, but it was a bit unkempt, and it really showed in the pool area. There was debris, leaves, dead bugs, etc. all in the pool and hot tub. Keep in mind they charge most guests a \"resort fee\" to use these services. For a place that is supposed to be high end, they are slacking on keeping the place tidy. I would also appreciate knowing there was a conference going on here during our stay, and furthermore being advised by the front desk. They told me about the Veranda Restaurant which we could eat at, yet they failed to tell me that a conference had a private party on the patio, so my wife and I had to eat inside when we were looking forward to relaxing on your patio by the fireplace which you so proudly display in photos on your website. Instead we come to California and have to eat dinner inside. We came here to stay in a nice place, not feel like outsiders that are relegated to certain parts of the hotel. Forewarning of amenities not available would be a good idea up front. Its the ethical thing to do. We also would have left for dinner. Good thing we only stayed one night. In regards to Veranda, the food was \"OK\". It wasn't special and thus again was overpriced. For dinner for 150 bucks I could go to an abundant number of restaurants that would make this place look like Chili's. Everything was just average. Breakfast was just blah, and again overpriced. Seriously not joking, Bob Evans breakfast is just as good.. This is a common theme unfortunately with places like this, they are so pretentious that they overcharge for everything under the guise of \"luxury\" and hope you won't notice just how average everything is. Go have breakfast at La Valencia in La Jolla if you want to see what an expensive breakfast should taste like. They even wanted 5 bucks for half of a grapefruit. Are you kidding me? So you are charging 10 dollars for a piece of fruit? Was this grown by magic fairies in never never land? Upon checkout the front desk was clueless on my preferred hotels points booking and tried to charge me for the stay as well as the resort fee which I was told were both covered upon my check-in. She then had to call about the rate, then tried to charge again for the resort fee, I then had to explain again that it was included per the check-in person. She took care of them but was completely zoned out and unapologetic about it. NOW THE WORST PART! Awful spring laden mattress that looks like its 10 years old and sleeps like a homeless shelter. My wife and I both woke up with sore backs. It bounces like a trampoline. The pillows were also terrible. Stiff and hard. Then, to make matters worse, you have some type of pad under the bottom sheet but its only queen sized?? so it doesn't fit, bunches up and you can feel it around your feet. Then you put a top sheet over the mattress that isn't even tucked in? Seriouisly the mattrress was exposed!! You don't even have a fitted sheet or a washable matress pad? Disgusting.. You can't have a quality resort and try to pretend its a relaxing place with beds this crappy. I just couldn't believe it. All we could do is laugh because it was so bad. And I travel about 33% of the year for business. I'm really not that picky normally, but this is supposed to be a high end place. I've stayed in Comfort Inn's with better beds than this. Hampton Inn's have more consistent bedding, perhaps your management team should stay in a Hampton to learn a bit about a decent bed, and Hampton isn't even close to luxury. At the least it would be an upgrade. Looking at other reviews, I'm not the first to mention it. For this alone I give this place 1 Star and would never go back. If you have to make a list of the top five things essential to a relaxing hotel, you have to include a nice bed. Guests should wake up feeling refreshed and revived, not with aching backs. My wife and I were even joking that they probably have bad beds to drive more business to the Spa for a massage! If the beds were decent I would have gave it three stars. Would never return or recommend to others.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monroe, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cYuck!\u201d", "Author": "Sherry H", "ReviewID": "UR128547739", "Content": "We went here for a meeting that lasted three days.

It's a great reminder for me that marketing isn't about accuracy--it's about sales. The reservationist got our date wrong then didn't return my call after multiple attempts to correct the issue. I should have backed out then, but I called the front desk instead to resolve it. The front desk was fantastic every time I called them before and during the stay, however. We arrived after a long day at the zoo with my young son. Valet/bell asked if we'd like assistance, we said yes (twice), but when they saw our room location, they basically insisted we park ourselves. That's fine except we had to haul our bags, with our tired 5 year old through a big parking lot and up a few flights of stairs and all the way around the building. After a long day, it would have been nice to have someone help with our bags, especially since we said we'd like help. Room service was great. Went above and beyond to make suggestions on dinner and gave us perfect directions--elsewhere. Once we got to the hotel, we weren't feeling so confident about having dinner at the hotel, so we went out. The room was a miserable disappointment. Great view, but there were several issues that stopped us from enjoying our stay. The decor was fine, not horrible, not great. It was dated like the exterior of the hotel. The bathroom was spacious and attractive though. It was bright with a nice soaking tub, separate shower with a rain shower head. White subway tile and classic beige marble. Not over the top, but definitely the nicest part of the suite, actually. That's where the nice ended. The construction is either so old that the floors shake, or it's always been very, very, poor. You couldn't tip toe across the room without the floor shaking severely, and we are not big people. I had to call the front desk to make sure there was no one below us because I was worried we were bothering the neighbors. It was ridiculous. Made it difficult to relax because I felt like we had to just sit quietly on the bed and not move around. The next misery was that I found (without looking) many long brown hairs around the suite--inside the sheets, in the bathtub, on the pillow etc. Really gross. It was probably from the housekeeping staff and not the previous guests, but still so not okay to find other people's hair everywhere you are going to sleep. Then there was an area in the grout next to the mini fridge that was sticky, stained, and smelled suspiciously like vomit--while standing nearby. Sorry to be rude, but it was foul. I threw down a towel so we didn't have to walk on the tile. So, at this point, we just wanted to go to sleep so we could get up and leave in the morning. Well, a good night's sleep wasn't in the cards. The sheets and pillows were the absolute worst quality I may have ever felt. Not kidding. That includes the hospital stay when my son was born. They were stiff, scratchy and so cheap. I've never been to prison, but I'm just imagining the sheets... The bed started with horrible mattress, a flat sheet, then a \"comforter\" and another flat sheet. Since the first sheet wasn't fitted, we were literally sleeping on the bare mattress by the morning. If you turn over at all while sleeping, the sheet just moves too and ends up slipping out from under you. Again, so gross. Can't even imagine what my family was sleeping on all night. Seriously, the worst night's sleep EVER in a hotel. After that, all I wanted to do was have each of us take a hot shower with lots of soap. Wished we had brought flip flops for the shower, but the water was hot, the pressure was great, and the aveda products were nice. Of course, then we had to get out of the shower and dry off with towels that the YMCA wouldn't supply for free. I think I am traditionally very fair with reviews and almost forgiving at times. However, the issues we had here, some of them so easy to fix, were just unacceptable for any hotel. Seriously, actually CLEAN the rooms and then spend some money on new bedding and towels. The floor shaking issue, would be harder to fix, but they should be ashamed of the other issues. If you stay here, good luck.

I booked an regular room but upon arrival was upgraded to a room overlooking the golf course. We were on the top floor of the 700 building which not only afforded us a beautiful view of the golf course but were able to enjoy the vaulted ceilings in our room. It was so rustic but with modern amenities, such as a large flat panel TV and a beautiful king size bed that was lite from the bottom to give it a very warm glow. The bathroom was stunning with a huge soaking tub and separate shower enclosure. I also loved the Aveda hair and skin products! That's definitely a nice touch! We checked in our room with only a few minutes to spare before we had to be at the spa for our massage and when we returned the staff had left a plate of cheese and a bottle of wine for my husbands birthday! Compliments of the hotel! Now that is a first class resort!! The spa is amazing! I have been there before for a massage and really enjoy sitting by the pool after my massage if it's a nice day. My husband did not golf this time but has golfed at the RBI in the past and he says it's one of his favorite courses! This is an amazing resort with the best customer service I have ever had!

I called the front desk on Thursday morning - very early - asking if they could schedule a couple of spa services for me for the next day. I was informed that I would have to leave a voicemail for the spa as they are the only ones who have access to the appointment book. That made sense - so, I left the spa a voice mail. I never heard from them all day and upon returning to the hotel, later that evening, inquired again. I was informed the spa was closed but that the front desk would send them an email to contact me first thing Friday morning. I was on conference calls until about 11am on Friday morning and never heard from the spa. I left a voice mail with the manager of guest services informing her that the spa lost out on approximately $400 as no one had gotten back to me. I specifically stated I wasn't looking for anything free, but just wanted to make the Inn aware of the matter. I left the resort to go and enjoy the day in La Jolla. Around 2pm, I received a call from the spa asking me if I wanted to book my services for Saturday. I told them that I had left that voice mail the prior day and that I had wished for spa services on Friday. The response I get is \"oh, I'm sorry, we can book you now\". I retorted no thanks since I'm in La Jolla - 25 minutes away. BTW, I never heard back from the guest services manager either, which I do believe is poor customer service.

Ask for a room overlooking the golf course...quiet and close to the main building with a lovely bar area and again, outstanding service.

Overall we had a great stay. The spa is definitely the highlight of the property and we had booked services for noon. My expectation was that the hotel would hold onto our bags for us until check-in. Instead the front desk didn't even say a word and sent us to our room at 10:30 a.m. The property itself is well maintained and can best be described as a garden setting. With that said, the architecture is late 1970s / early 1980s Spanish, which just makes the feel of the hotel stuck in this period. This place can do everything right, but the design just didn't age well and that's something that can never be changed. The rooms are comfortable and recently upgraded. The beds were firm with nice linens, the television was high def, ours had a patio overlooking a courtyard. The first floor rooms have private patios, but abut common areas and completely lack privacy. As has been mentioned before, the bathrooms seem dated, although they did look newer. Perhaps it was use of inexpensive and generic tile. The spa was great, but a tad pricey for services. Spa guests have access to the spa pool, which is a lot nicer than the hotel's \"regular\" pools. The food was average hotel food and reasonably priced. Drinks were a downright bargain with $4.00 beers across the property. Free ice tea is also available near the treatment rooms. My one negative comment about the spa is there were three bachelorette parties booked in the pool cabanas. This is fine, but maybe it shouldn't be sold as the spa pool. Really it's just the one remotely hip area the property has to offer and it is borderline day club on a Saturday. All they need is a DJ. Aside from the spa bar, there is also a series of bars in an area called the Viranda. These could just as easily be billed as one bar, not three. The outside area around the fire pit (billed as the Fireside Lounge) was a nice was to spend the early evening. There is also a bar immediately inside with a contemporary decor, and finally a separate area adjacent billed as the Sports Bar. Apparently this is slang used by staff to indicate it's the only place with a TV. The formal restaurant is nice, if not a bit dated and stuffy. Collared shirts are mandatory. I wore a suit and tie and felt comfortable. There is also a separate bar area for use while waiting for your table. The bartender, Tom, was great and had worked for the hotel forever. He was happy to check on our table for us and had just the right balance of conversation without being intrusive. The waiter was great as well, recognizing a long delay in the meal and bringing a complimentary item to address the problem without us even bringing it to his attention. On Sunday morning there are two separate brunches, and we had breakfast in the Viranda area before heading out. The selection of items was good, but again, it was the service that was standout. We did not leave the property once, which is exactly what we were looking for. This might not be for everyone though, and it's really quite a drive to central part of San Diego. The location is not practical if your goal is being out and about and just sleeping at the hotel. Also, there is absolutely nothing of interest in the immediate area. Finally, it's likely there are going to be multiple functions at the property which could affect your enjoyment. The Saturday we stayed, there were the 3 bachelorette parties, at least 2 weddings, and some type of couples workshop. We didn't have any problems, but I can easily see restaurants or pool areas being unexpectedly closed.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "Suryonhan", "ReviewID": "UR118503646", "Content": "We loved Rancho Bernardo Inn.

We booked one night with the spa treatment inclusive (their website) and one night using a Group Golfer certificate for unlimited golf with the room rate. POSITIVES: 1)The unlimited golf was for both the day of check and check out! We fit in 3 rounds: 2 on the check in day, 1 on the check out day. Most resorts only offer 1 day of unlimited golf to each paid day of stay. 2)Friday night was a \"Managers reception\" with complimentary appetizers (good quality) and drinks (generous pours) It was family and kids oriented with a section of fun kids appetizers and centered around the pool. 3)The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. 4) The Veranda area is beautiful, overlooking the golf course and spectacular fountain. The lit firepit and fireplace is nice and the dinner / breakfast buffets were with wonderful choices and reasonable for the price. NEGATIVES/SUGGESTIONS: 1) The mens sauna was broken 2 days that we know of. The male masseuse was the only attendant to notify that it needed service. Of the 3 mens showers, only 1 had all 3 items: Shampoo, conditioner and shower gel available. The rest were in need refilling. 2) For both the mens or womens spa: There we NO iced towels (no significant cost) around the steam or jacuzzi areas. There were no disposable razors for clean-up/hygiene. 3) Our woodside room (#625) had a central fireplace and jacuzzi area. Although fresh wood was placed in the fireplace, it was never lit! Lighting it would draw people to gather and make it more inviting to sit after being in the jacuzzi. 3) Specific to the Golf course: We were not informed of the punched greens prior to scheduling tee times. This, combined with the rest of the 1st and poor 2nd cuts caused us to fee the course was not in good shape even though it is advertised to be the only S. Diego course to host both a PGA and LPGA tour event. On top of that, everyone who made tee times on Sat. Sept 3rd were not recorded correctly in the \"computer\", off by as much as 45 - 60 minutes. We also say 5somes and even a party of 6 (probably from the 7 wedding groups pre-golf event) on the course. Needless to say, starting an hour after a scheduled tee time and then being held up on every hole (6 hr. round) made it difficult to enjoy the course.

The front desk staff, to which a first impression is made, are full of ego and dishonest. They act as if everyone staying with them is rich and if you are not, you should not be staying there. They take great liberties with your credit or debit card not fully disclosing what is actually being preauthorized from your account and when confronted after you were originally told nothing was being done with the card, they act as if something was wrong with you! Quite honestly the worst experience @ a hotel. There staff need to be trained on courtesy, compassion, kindness, and HONESTY. On to the room... the beds were hard, pillows stiff and crunchy, and the construction is OLD and not well kept. There is a constant sound of pipes in movement and adjustment, leaks in the room & bathroom, and old matted rugs. I had a better experience at a Crowne Plaza in Irvine, and much nicer staffer there.

Overall, Rancho Bernardo is beautiful, elegant, serene, magical. It is a large resort in San Diego, about 30 minutes drive from the downtown area. It is also a country club/golf club, so there are some \"regulars\" who hang out by the bar in early evenings. Lovely decor and interior design, lots of nooks to relax, talk, have a drink, or read a book. There are two full-service restaurants on site, a golf course, a full spa, and several pools. I was very impressed by how well all the staff were trained - every single staff member was friendly, greeted us, and went out of their way to assist us. Truly exceptional service. The grounds are extensive and very well maintained. We took walks around the grounds before and after meals and were amazed at how beautiful and well kept the property is, and how diverse the plants and trees were. Restaurants were excellent, although it was a little confusing to figure out where the restaurants are located and what they served. Menus weren't readily available in our rooms, online, or at the door. The spa services, staff, and building are very high end. I had an outdoor massage and a facial, and both were wonderful. The massage was the best I've had and I overhead other guests in awe over the quality of the massage as well. I strongly recommend the outdoor massage followed by a quiet lunch and cocktails at the spa-only pool. Hotel rooms are split into several buildings and you are provided a map upon check-in. It is a little confusing at first, but the property is manageable on foot. Note that resort fees and parking fees may or may not be included in your rate, so be sure to check on that if you are on a budget. We saw several families there as a group and one pool is designated for families and all others are adults only. They had some kid-only activities like an outdoor kid movie at the pool, so they do have some family-friendly activities. However, I'd recommend this property most for a romantic getaway for couples and for a girls' weekend complete with spa treatments.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLosing their personal touch\u201d", "Author": "MBrooks76", "ReviewID": "UR114833414", "Content": "Stayed there for 4 nights for a conference.

The bathrooms especially are very dark and depressing. The adult pool definitely needs to be redone as most of the pool tiles had cracked and stuff was starting to grow out of them. Furthermore, the hotel is located about 30 minutes from downtown San Diego.

In my room my tv couldn't even be watched from the bed not to mention I was basically in the dungeon with zero light and view. Then the service...just awful. There was one person at the front checking people and she was slow. I tell her I am a light sleeper and ask for a quiet room so she puts me on the bottom floor...does that make sense? The room number was 718 so it seemed like a higher floor. Then in the morning the room service took 45 minutes and instead of a large pot of coffee which I ordered, they bring me one cold cup?

She lives in Rancho Bernardo, and I had been driving to see her for 20 years ~ and yet I had never even seen the Rancho Bernardo Inn....and THAT'S one of the great things about it. Unassuming and tucked away in the rolling hills of northern San Diego county, it is a perfect getaway for locals as well as those looking to avoid the beach crowds of tourists that flock to the typical San Diego destinations. The grounds are immaculate (as it's a golf resort) and the building are tiered around the property, with mature trees, lots of shade, outside patios with fireplaces and other outside areas. We stayed in a \"Deluxe Resort Double Queen\" and the room was big, quiet and had lots of amenities. The bathroom was huge! There was a jacuzzi tub, separate shower, separate toilet area and 2 separate vanity areas so that everyone has space to get ready for dinner (or to go out for the day) at the same time. There were 2 queen beds with \"memory foam\" tops and an assortment of 4 different pillows on each bed for sleeping comfort. Internet was included in our package (check to make sure it's included in your package) at no charge. Huge flat screen tv with the usual choices, coffee maker and refrigerator and 2 closets, and a full length mirror were all wonderful to have. The room was really clean, bright and airy, especially with the balcony doors open. Carpet and linens were in great shape, as were the spa robes in the room. We had 50 minute massages included in the package. The massages were done in small outside rooms with heated tables in a quiet outdoor setting. If you don't get the package, their Signature massage is $120 for 50 minutes. Since it was my first massage, I can't tell you whether or not it was \"good\", but I can tell you that the waiting room was relaxing and filled with complimentary fruit, teas, flavored water and spa music. There were 2 hot tubs (one a women only and indoors, one outdoors) and a steam room available with your spa purchase. The outdoor pool and hot tub are salt water and heated to 82 degrees year round. I'm not a golfer, but the people going by with bags all seemed to be smiling, so it can't be all that bad! We ate at \"The Veranda\" for early dinner. The menu wasn't extensive, but it wasn't expensive either, with my margerita pizza being $10.....the food was good, service was absolutely great and the view was beautiful. They have a Sunday Brunch that packs the house on Sundays, so make sure you make reservations if that's your meal of choice. Overall I was very impressed. For the money, it is a great deal. I'm not a spa girl, and I wouldn't hesitate to tell friends to stay at the Rancho Bernardo Inn. It's seclusion and peacefulness (well, besides the golf cart!) mixed with it's cleanliness and great service make you feel pampered and spoiled.

Compared to the chain hotels I stay at, the buffet was pretty limited. On the flip side though, the restaraunt staff is extremely attentive and professional. My wife completely enjoyed the Spa experience. The staff were friendly, professional and skilled. The facility was clean and inviting. She came away relaxed and invigorated. The golf course is fun and has some good challenging holes. It rained hard one of the days of our stay but the next morning the course was in great shape. Hat's off to the grounds staff.

My husband and I were looking forward to a relaxing weekend while the kids stayed at grandma's house. Unfortunately we were sorely disappointed and left feeling ripped off. We checked in and headed to our room. When we opened the door I stepped into the room to turn on the lights only to find my shoe and the bottom of my pants completely soaked from a pool of water that had run from the bathroom into the entry way of the room due to a leaking toilet. We headed to the front desk to change rooms where they told us that they only had a room with 2 queen beds left...we had reserved a king. Eventually they found one for us, but it clearly wasn't ready for guests. When we arrived we were short towels, the toilet paper was almost gone and there was no replacement roll, there was no bathmat when we got out of the shower, there was no kleenex, no trash can, there was a dead rat outside the room with crows stopping by for a snack, ants in the bathroom and the cleanliness of the bathroom counter left something to be desired. These problems persisted even after housekeeping visited the following morning. They recently remodeled the hotel. The rooms have some nice built in cabinetry now, but the walls and floors were very dirty and needed some attention. When they replaced the carpet the didn't bother to take off the baseboards, so the carpet stopped about 1/4 inch from the wall/ basebaords and was all shredded and coming up on the edges. It was also stained and dirty. We went to the fitness center to workout and the short comings continued. There were no towels or clean headsets to use. We had booked a friends and family rate that was advertised in a mailer we had received. One of the ammenities was that the in room mini bar was included in our rate. It would have been a great deal if the bar had ever been stocked. Finally, when we went to check out, they had added a $40 restauarant charge for a meal that was not ours to our bill. By the time all was said and done, (charging for self parking in surface lots that are empty, passing along San Diego Marketing fees to the traveler, resort fees for things services that we don't use) our two night stay cost us about $400.

The staff - the whole staff - were the most helpful and accommodating I've encountered.

The q/q room was comfortable and very roomy; plenty of space for 2 ladies to spread out without tripping over each other. The double-vanity in the bathroom is a nice touch, as is the small balcony with chairs. The only small problem was our room near the stairs, where it got a bit noisy during late-evening returns and early-morning check-outs. The spa atmosphere was relaxing and the treatments were as good as we expected them to be. Prices are high, but par for the course at a resort like this. Adult-only pool with cabanas was incredibly tranquil; spa lunch poolside was healthy and delicious. I booked thru Southwest Airlines Vacations, and expected a \"value\" experience, but on check-in, the manager threw in an invitation to the Manager's Reception and free breakfast at the Veranda, plus free items in the mini-fridge, like beer, wine, and snacks.

When you walk up to one of them, there is almost a look of fear in their eyes. It seems they are ready to be defensive. Smiles seem a little fake. The clerk who checked me in failed to tell me about the free breakfast and complimentary items in the mini-fridge. Fortunately, I was aware of them while making the reservation. The room was beautiful and overlooked the golf course. We were on the top level, so the ceilings were high. The room was very big, recently updated and well-furnished. The bathroom had double sinks which was nice. However, the bathrooms appeared a little older. There was a little mold in the shower, but not a deal-breaker. The restaurant was painfully slow, but forgivable our first morning. The second was an awful experience. To lure families, the resort offers kids free meals. When we went to breakfast, a few sets of parents, who were traveling together, were at the restaurant with their children. The kids were screaming and running all over the place. They also were only wearing bathing suits and no shoes which is actually a health code violation. The management did nothing and should have on its own. To make matters worse, our order was not taken for 20 minutes. Our pot of coffee was forgotten after three requests. The manager, noticing we were not happy, offered to credit our room for the cost of breakfast. We were satisfied with that, but after his offering, neither he nor anyone from the staff checked on us again. As we started to walk out, the manager ran over and apologized again. Also, self-park was $10 a day for guests. However, people who were at the hotel for functions were able to park in the same lot for free. And, in some cases, we could not find a parking space. At least it was at times we only had to quickly run to the room. We actually left our car in the fire zone with flashers! The resort has no way to really monitor who is parking where.

While the grounds are beautiful and the Inn was conveniently located for the wedding events, we were disappointed enough with several small things that we would not recommend the Inn to friends. First, as another reviewer mentioned, the air conditioning in the room is very loud (especially when you are in the sink area outside the bathroom). Second, the iron in our room was so crusted with hard water deposits and gunk that it left residue on a shirt. We had to call the front desk twice and stop by once over the course of a day to get a new one (and it still had deposits, though not as bad). Third, the sound insulation between rooms (especially those with doors that allow for adjoining rooms) is poor. We were in a room next to a family with young children, and the sound traveled right through the (closed) adjoining doors. Crying babies are a part of life, but hopefully not part of your hotel stay. Fourth, the room was not made up when we returned at 3pm to get ready for the wedding after a day of sightseeing. The housekeeper stopped by shortly afterward, but we had to tell her to come back since we were busy showering and changing. Fifth, we heard from other wedding guests that one of the other buildings at the Inn was completely without water for most of a day. We were lucky to have avoided that, but now I can guess that's why maintenance men were dealing with a walkway near the family pool that was flooded with stinky overflow water. Yuck. Sixth, the bridal party had arranged for golf cart service to shuttle the guests between the Inn and the wedding site (at a private home half a mile down the residential road leading to the Inn). When we asked both the valet and the front desk about the service, however, they didn't know anything about it, and we ended up driving to the wedding (we had to arrive a bit early to the wedding to help, but I was surprised that no one had even heard of these arrangements). I'm not sure if this was a miscommunication by the hotel or the bridal party, but it was certainly a frustration. Finally, I think it is ridiculous that the hotel charges $10 a day for self-parking in an open lot. This is an Inn in a residential area 30 minutes from downtown San Diego where all guests are likely to have a car. Charge for valet, sure, but charging for VERY tiny self-parking spots is a ripoff (and was not mentioned to me when I made a reservation, unlike the $20/day resort fee, which was mentioned repeatedly). I doubt that they charge people who merely come as guests at the restaurants or for events at the Inn, so they certainly shouldn't charge hotel guests. Again, all of these would count as small disappointments and these things may not have bothered me at a downscale hotel, but when you are paying as much as the RB Inn charges (even at the discounted block rate) I expect more.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "healthysusan", "Title": "\u201cMeeting planners - take note - the Rancho Bernardo Inn is ideal for business meetings!\u201d", "Author": "healthysusan", "ReviewID": "UR73633841", "Content": "I managed an event for my company at the Rancho Bernardo Inn that was attended by 200 people.

Ended up getting it for $75 per night with no mention of a $20 dollar resort fee and $10 dollar parking fee. This made me mad upon check-in. The parking lot is ridiculous to park in on the weekend. I would pay $2 more for Vallet, although that line was very long. Our room was on the 2nd floor with a courtyard view.(no elevators, so be where...) The room was nicely decorated with under bed lighting(My daughter thought that was cool) .We had a frig stocked with beer, soda, water and some snacks, hence the $20 fee. It was leaking and had to continually wipe up water off the floor. The beds were comfortable , but the towels left a lot to be desired. they were small and rough. not a high quality. The coffee bar in the room was not fully stocked. We enjoyed our stay, but I would stay on the first floor closer to the pool. I tried for days to contact the hotel directly to pull up my online reservation,but they always said they didn't have it yet.. They need to let online bookers know in advance the fees they charge at this resort, regardless if you use the items in the frig or not.

Room was on 3rd floor -tastefully decorated with a great view of the golf course. Very private, big room with a big bathtub and separate standing shower. Very clean. Spa experience was okay. The massage treatments were good but the waiting/sitting area for before and after your treatment was too small and had high traffic. The person bringing in the towels as well as some of the other employees used this door to the outside to frequently go in and out. This isn't relaxing considering the air is cold outside and you are sitting in your robe (with nothing else on underneath). Hot tea was lukewarm and never checked. Steam room and sauna was nice - gender specific. Got dressed and went to the Bizcocho for dinner. We were looking forward to it and this was one of the reasons why we booked a stay at this hotel. It did NOT live up to our expectations or any of the previous reviews that we read. El Bizcocho is no longer a 5 STAR restaurant. This was very disappointing considering the reputation of this restaurant. It was more of a typical hotel restaurant and less like a special occasion one. The menu on the website is not accurate since many of the dishes were not offered and the tasting menu is no longer available. Service was slow and lukewarm at best. We actually couldn't wait to leave the dining area. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise at the Veranda. Had a \"Border\" omelet that was excellent.

This place, compared to other similarly rated properties was very disappointing. We wanted to check out as soon as we arrived. There was a long and confusing hike to find our hotel room. Prior to arriving Arlene in the spa bent over backwards to accommodate our last minute requests at the spa. Because of all of her hard work and professionalism we decided to give RBI another chance. Arlene in the spa was so accommodating and welcoming we decided to tolerate a lot more than we normally would have. When we arrived in the room it was nice and clean with what appeared to be a lowly budgeted recent remodel. When we sat on the bed, the mattress slid across the frame mounting about 6 inches. The frame of the bed was too big for the mattress! The bed was extremely uncomfortable. You could hear springs in the mattress all night and neither my husband or I got a good night sleep! I ended up with bruises on my legs from banging them on the frame every time I got out of bed. The only nice thing I can say about this place is the spa was a wonderful experience and the atmosphere of the grounds is beautiful. Our hotel rate included 2 spa treatments with each night stay for $268. Which is a great deal if the room had not been so miserable. I have been to better spas, but everyone was quite professional and caring. My husband chose to have the signature massage and I chose the aroma therapy facial. We also opt'd for the spa pedicure, which in my opinion was a waste of money. The environment for the pedicure was not in the spa area and the bench seat was very uncomfortable. The room was attached to the fitness area and was very loud and non-relaxing. The spa has a nice dressing room area with all of the amenities, 3 showers and plenty of lockers. While waiting for your treatment you can enjoy a private men or women only steam room and jacuzzi, the saline pool or co-gender jacuzzi, or relax in the cabanas that are included for spa members only. Needless to say the night only got worse when we went to the Veranda Dining area and were highly disappointed by the very low quality of the food offered there. The ambiance was amazing as it sits outside overlooking the golf course but we could have gotten better food from Denny's down the road!

The pool they show online is not the pool you are allowed to use unless you have booked at the spa for that day but no where do they mention that, as stated in other reviews the pools you are allowed to use are no better than a motel 6 pool. The pools are not conveniently located by the rooms so we only used it 1 time. There is no elevators, where we were located was the 2nd floor in the middle of the hotel so up 2 flights of stairs and down the long hallway was no fun at all with luggage and children, this was everytime we left. I will say that the staff was friendly until check out. At check out we were hit with an unexpected additional 232.00 to out hotel bill. We were there for 7 nights/8 days and were charged a 20.00 a night resort fee (that covered the so called free internet) and an additional 10.00 a night parking fee so the additional 30.00 a night added up. We were not told about this fee upon check in yet the hotel manager was not willing to do anything for us so we were stuck paying that. We also ordered room service breakfast one morning for our family of 4 and an additional 20.00 was added to that bill,18% gratuity and a tip, on top of that they expect another tip when delivered (this is standard in all hotels for room service, so not just this one) but when you are paying that kind of money you would expect the food to be delivered hot, but it was cold so our 80.00 breakfast was no good at all. I hate to see what dinner for 4 would have cost us as everything in the resort was very over priced. I was so upset at check out that honestly if I were offerd a free week there I would turn it down so fast. I was very unhappy with this place and have no desire to ever step foot on this property again as I have stayed at nicer Holiday Inns. Please do not expect much from this hotel when booking, ask about any additional fees up front and you may have an ok stay but for the nightly rate they charge I would really really recommend another resort. Oh and the resort is full of cobb webs they dont even try to clean up.

It is attached to the Spa which is not fully associated with the Hotel and not to mention it's about a 10 minute walk down a service road from the main lobby. The other pools on the actual hotel property don't look remotely close in comparison. The pools on the hotel property look like shabby motel pools and there is limited bar service at the children's pool (none at the Adults Only Pool) and its hours of operation vary depending on what time a bar tender shows up. The front desk staff told us the bar \"usually opens in the afternoon between around 1230 and 2.\" The property is no better than a Best Western in terms of cleanliness, amenities, quality of furniture and fixtures, and smell. The property is simply run down and the limited staff is under trained. Service is very comparable to a motel with the exception of some room service. With that said, the Golf Course and surrounding grounds are very beautiful, but they are not attached to the hotel itself (something the Spa and Golf Course make very clear). The hotel is unfortunately outdated, the website is VERY misleading in terms of the overall luxury feel they convey and of course the swimming pool situation. If you have a family and get a good rate, you'll enjoy it, but maintain your expectations.

Our shower looked like it had tiles replaced (poorly) and had two open holes to the back of the shower which were not even caulked. There were holes in the drywall in the main building that had not been repaired. In addition, the railings were NOT child safe on our balcony. My three year old girls could easily walk between the rails and could have fallen through three stories down. Thus, we did not get to use them. When we ate at the Veranda for dinner, they only had four entrees available (Caesar salad, philly cheese steak and two others (equally uninspiring). With kids, we couldn't really eat at the bar or the \"nicer\" restaraunt so for all other meals we ate out. This was disappointing as we choose a resort to have a resort experience. The room was nice but the walls were paper thin. We could hear our neighbors just opening their closet doors. This was problematic as we would get our toddlers to bed only to have them be woken up several times by neighbors who truly were not being loud. Right now, the hotel is running a package to appear to be family friendly. However, they have three pools and only allow children in one of the pools which was a hike for us. Every time we tried to eat with the kids in one of the restaurants they did not apply the kids eat free discount and we had to ask them to rerun the bill to apply the discount. (twice -- then we gave up because the selection was so limited). Its a 15 minute drive to get food outside of the resort but there are some decent options around town. The big pro to the hotel for kids are the grounds themselves. We had a great time exploring the resort and took many long walks to look at the beautiful fountains, trees, and flowers.

We heard the same from several other guests, too, one of whom had to switch rooms altogether in order to have properly-functioning AC. The room itself was fine - generally comfortable but as far as decor, it was slightly dated. The bed in our room was positioned at an angle which made the room feel smaller than it probably was.

They must need a team of full time landscapers, but they should do a better job raking up dead leaves, which are really littered all over the place. Per an earlier review, it is true that the pretty pool in the pictured on the hotel website is only for paying spa clients. Don't worry though, there are several other nice pool areas (some with jacuzzi's) including the one adjacent to the room where we stayed. (154) The rooms are nice, and partially updated. I say partially because the furniture in the room, including the bed and TV are top notch. They also have two separate vanities, both with electric outlets, which is very nice. Oddly, the bathroom area seems very out of place with the rest of the room and the property as a whole. There is an \"old money\" country club feel about the place, but the money must of ran out in the bathroom. The limestone vanity, mirror and light fixtures are nice, but the floor and shower are the old, small, ceramic tiles that must be original with the property and are showing a lot of wear. (60's era perhaps) The shower and tub itself are just horrible. They do the have the customary curved shower rod, but the water controls and drain are really old and falling apart. On a more positive note, our room faced one of their pools and had a private patio and access to the pool. This was really nice, especially if you bring children. I would not pay the normal $240 asking price for this place, but for the $70 I paid on Priceline, I really feel like I got a steal.

We arrived late, so it was not easy to navigate the place in the dark. The room was decent, but nonetheless I brought my Lysol (wiped all the door knobs, the remote control and toilet). For those who stayed there in 2006 and talked about \"tired rooms\" and construction, it's all done now. It has a rustic/Spanish (not Mexican) feel to it, perhaps you can imagine being in Europe or in the country somewhere. It's nice overall, but keep in mind that it's not a new place (although they've updated their rooms). Here are few complaints: The beds were HARD. The pillows were strangly filled. Mine was hard as a rock and it felt full of knots. Another pillow was \"deflated\". The comforters were not stuffed well either (some won't keep you warm). The fan in the bathroom was very loud and rattled (old perhaps) The air conditioning was the same as the fan. The sales lady in the golf shop was snooty. If you are not as picky as I, and the above mentioned won't bother you, than you should try this place. Make sure you get a reduced rate though. The grounds are beautiful and the waiter we had was very helpful. Can't say the same for the hostess (probably her young age had something to do with it). My husband kept complimenting me on finding this place, so he liked it. He is even planning on bringing his sales team there for some R&R.

After checking in, we walked down the musty halls full of signs indicating various conference and wedding locations. The room, overlooking the back pool, was equally musty, dark, and damp. The decor was dated and I would compare it to an upscale Howard Johnson. Yes, it was clean and a good size. However, if there were renovations (again, find hard to believe), they were done on the cheap. The bathroom was the same - upscale Hojo style. Cheap tilework in the shower, plastic seeming fixtures, and the like. We decided to step out by the pool and relax. Let's just say it was a D.I.Y. pool. No one offered a drink, to help us with towels, or anything of the sort. We visited the spa pool on the following day - never even saw anyone. When I checked out, I was not asked whether I enjoyed my stay, otherwise, I would have mentioned some of my issues to the desk person. The excpetion to the overall D.I.Y. service was at the spa. I had a wonderful massage and the spa staff was terrific. The restaurant servers were very attentive as well - the food was standard hotel fare. Nothing great, nothing bad. Overall, this hotel deserves more of a 2 or 3 star rating. It certainly is not worthy of the price paid.

Our waitress and the bartender were so rude we had to get management to discuss their behavior (it's a long story).

The Pros: -Check in was seamless -Large TV in the room The Cons: -Rooms are hard to find (some entrances are inside of the building while others must be accessed via a courtyard) -Upon entering our room, we were greeted with a large mirror lying face down on the floor. It was very apparent that the mirror had not been mounted properly. -There were NO bath towels in our room. We had to call the front desk to request them. We requested 3. They brought 2. -Several loose tiles in the vanity. Not a pretty sight and definitely not what one would expect from a luxury resort. -And the worst.... there was a blood stain on the bed comforter. Yuck! We voiced our complaints to the front desk and, while the staff person apologized for all the mishaps, I was left with the distinct impression that she couldn't care less. She did not offer to get a manager, but merely offered to have me fill out a comment card. I gladly did so because I feel that it is completely heinous for this place to advertise itself as a 5 star hotel when it is, at best, a 2 star motel. The demographic at this hotel skews towards an older crowd with some families in the mix. My husband and I are in our early 30's but have been told that we appear younger. This is one of those places that gives the impression that, because they assume that we are younger and perhaps not as well-off as their other clientele, that we are not worthy of a higher level of service.

Each guest was provided her own locker, a nice robe and use of spa towels. No other added amenities such as lotions, face wash, swabs, hair products. We had the couples massage/ deep tissue - indoors. The service was good, relaxing. The outdoor \"adult\" spa pool and cabanas were nice. Although pool side service for drinks was a bit lacking. There is no assigned server for the pool. You have to ask the spa to send someone down. Nevertheless, it was very serene (no kids) and it was not crowded at all - even for a holiday weekend. The room was nice - 3 star quality. The outside of the building looks a bit rustic. The inside of the room looks updated/ remodeled. The bathroom was fairly spacious: dual sinks, bathtub and separate shower. It was clean! The bath products were Aveda. The furniture in the room was a bit awkward. The bed was too small. It was a \"full\" size. (even if we requested a large bed.) The mattress was comfortable, right amount of firmness. However, the couch was too big for the room - it partialy blocked access to the sliding door to the balcony. We had a nice view of the golf course. We had a large flat screen TV - Nice. The walls/floors were a bit thin - could hear some chatting next door. But we were not disturbed by it. I would not recommend the \"Veranda\" restaurant at the resort. Very mediocre. The concerige was wonderful! She recommended a local restaurant called \"Cafe Luna\" - small, quaint, Italian eatery, with excellent food. Its about 10 minutes from the resort. We paid $200/night.

The best thing about the location is the proximity to the Wild Animal Park. If that is a main highlight in your travel agenda, definitely stay here. The property itself is well decorated and comforting, quiet, safe,fountains and wells everywhere, and though it is nice that there are two separate pools (one for kids and one adult pool) the adult pool was in a courtyard surrounded by rooms, and lots of foot traffic. The jacuzzi next to the adult pool was great, could fit about 18 people in there if you wanted to. There was a nice gleaming mediterranean pool in sight, yet it was part of the spa, and was being set up for an event while we were there, so we couldn't enjoy it. The grounds are dotted with cheesy motel lodge style jacuzzis hidden behind fenced in mini courtyards with a single bistro table with chair and covered in dirt and floating leaves. Not so fancy, eh? Note that this is a golf resort, and for golfers, it must be amazing, the course looked really nice. My boyfriend and I are not golfers, but never mind staying at golf-emphasis resorts, however we were looking forward to playing tennis, but guess what? The courts are under construction, and most of them have been torn down. As far as the rooms go, when they give you the option to stay on the first or second floor, always choose the second. First floor you get a sliding door and patio which EVERYONE can walk by and gawk at you, where as second floor has a balcony, and more privacy. The room had a slightly musty odor, but a super comfy bed and nice soft pillows. Ipod dock made getting ready feel more at home. The bathroom was OK, tub and shower were really nice, two sinks and plenty of space for toiletries, they supplied Aveda products which was also a nice touch, but the one pet peeve was that the bathroom didn't have a fan, which meant it would get very steamy after a hot shower, but worse, no circulation for \"odor.\" We ate lunch out on the terrace facing the course, this was possibly my favorite part, late afternoon watching all of the golfers coming back from their games, we enjoyed bloody marys, a mediocre salmon and an amazing, perfectly cooked risotto (with a mysterious mushroom mousse surrounding it.) We later in the evening enjoyed cocktails at the upstairs upscale restaurant, while we were considering dinner there. Food here is supposed to be amazing, but the environment felt a little too stuffy for our taste so we went out of the resort exploring (wish we hadn't, in retrospect dinner at the resort would have likely been much better.) All in all I would say this is a great place for golfers, or those who want something very quiet and safe with good food and nice cocktails.

You are charged extra for parking even though free parking outside the hotel would be a significant walk. The main pool was closed to hotel guests all day Saturday even though you pay an extra resort fee for use of the facilities. I called for a spa appointment two weeks in advance and was informed there were no appointments available for the entire weekend. There was a disgusting smell in the main bar (like sewage). Room service was extremely slow. The concierge was very helpful but that is about the only good thing I can say about this place.

We happened to get a pretty good rate for a Saturday night in high season for $199 all in. I would not pay a penny more, and I really don't even think that the our stay was worth that, but given the minimum stay requirements at other places, this suited us fine. The room was quite tired. They need to update it with new fittings in the bathroom, new furniture, new rugs, the whole deal. The hallways etc. could also use a renovation. The only positives were 1) the view from our balcony, though the furniture on the balcony did not encourage lounging (plastic netted chairs) 2) the Aveda brand toiletries. The \"adult\" pool area is ok, but the poolside \"bar\" is depressing and there were a notable lack of chairs. The gym is serviceable, though nothing fantastic, and the spa seemed very average. We did not play golf. The grounds--fountains, various stone pathways, etc.--did lend an air of serenity to the resort, which was much appreciated. We did have breakfast at the Veranda restaurant and this was a very good meal. We sat outside, which was lovely.

So called 'Manager' on duty was unapologetic, unhelpful and rude. When asked why they would close down their main pool on a Saturday in high season to full paying guests (bare in mind you are also charged a $15 per day 'resort fee' and $15 'parking fee' in addition to your room rate for using such great facilities), I was told that it would 'only be until 4.00 p.m.' i.e., the whole day....

Here is what we liked: The lovely fountains around the property fill the air with the relaxing sound of bubbling water. The grounds are beautiful and nicely shaded. There is a family pool and an adults only pool, although both are on the smallish side. The adult pool has a bartender and you can also order food to be delivered pool-side. We ate at El Bizcocho and it was amazing! Quite possibly our best meal EVER. We ordered the 7-course Chef's Choice with wine pairing. The entire meal was a surprise - each course chosen by the chef. We had wonderful hamachi, foie gras, duck, snapper, veal cheek. Unbelievable. The total bill came to $350 for two so it is pricey but worth it for a special treat. The golf was good, but somewhat over-priced. Unfortunately we had a very limited choice of tee times due to a big tournament that weekend. No concessions were offered for the inconvenience. Here is what we didn't like: The property is currently being upgraded and its not a moment too soon. The room decor is a bit shabby although the bed was clean and comfortable. The couch didn't look clean so I avoided sitting on it! Because of the ongoing renovations, we were bothered by loud construction noise during the day. We stayed in the Fountains building and they were re-roofing the buliding right next door. Bang! Bang! Bang! Ugh! There is a mini-bar but it was empty!?! There were few chairs at the adult pool. We requested additional ones be brought but they never were. There were a few children there and the adults-only policy was not enforced. The Veranda Restaurant had a horrible smell indoors. Not sure if it was cleaning chemicals or what but it was bad enough that we never saw anyone eating inside, only on the patio. The food was good but very over-priced. There are only 2 tennis courts remaining (out of 12 originally) and both are in marginal condition. The pro shop didn't even have a can of new tennis balls for lend or purchase. The other 10 courts were removed to make room for a big convention center and spa that is under construction.

It was a great afternoon for the adults along with the kids who spent the day in the pool playing with some of the pool toys that were provided by the resort. One morning I even had the pleasure of going down to the spa and having a wonderful swedish american massage. And after the massage I spent some time in the steam room... I could have spent all day in the spa but I had to get back to the room to spend some time with the family. On the evening we ate in the Veranda, there was an excellent buffet that was going on so half of our party ate from the buffet and then the rest of us ordered off their menu. Of course, we also made time to eat in El Bizcocho. We didn't bring the kids along since this restauarant is much more of a \"fine dining\" experience.

We chose to go to the San Diego area to visit Legoland and Seaworld for my two year old son. We stayed at the Rancho Bernardo Inn for four nights. We found this hotel in our Entertainment Book. This is suppose to be a four star hotel but I found should be no more than a three. This hotel had some good things I liked and bad things that I did not like. When we arrived at the hotel on Sunday, August 6, the valet service was great. They unloaded our bags with no problems. The grounds were beautiful. It was very green and very well manicured. They had two pools. One for families and one for adults only. I thought that was great. The fitness center was ok. Here is the part I did not like. The room was very large. We had plenty of space but was not very clean. The carpet had stains on it. The mini bar was not stocked. The bed spread was very out dated and was old and dengy. The bed skirt had stains and holes in it. I saw atleast 3 pieces of hair on the sheets. It was not our hair because we had just checked in. The chair that was in the room had a number of stains on it. The drapes had a number of stains and was old. The decore was out dated. I always carry lysol with me when I stay at a hotel and I used the whole can spraying the beds, bathroom, carpet, drapes and anything else I could. I never felt comfortable in this room. The straw that broke the camels back is I saw three spiders in the room over my four night stay. I hate spiders and to have them in my room was unacceptable. The balcony was nice to have. We were in the very back of the hotel which when you walked out, you were in the parking lot. I read the reviews from other guest before making our reservations and thought maybe I would just give it a try. I should have listened to the other guest that stayed there. I would have left but had pre-paid for the room through the Entertainment company and was to late to get a refund. I should of listened to people that had already stayed there and gave their opinion in their reviews. The staff was nice but I will never stay there again.

We booked our room for $79 through a bidding travel site and understood at the time that RBI had extra fees, bringing our total to just over $100 upon checkout. PROS: The grounds are beautiful; the buildings we saw were beautiful; I liked the idea that they had an adult swimming pool and a children's pool. Our room was spacious and well-decorated, and had a very comfortable bed and a nice patio. The internet access was easy and included in the \"extras\" fee. The bathroom was extra-spacious and the toiletries were \"yummy\". The air conditioning worked and the room was very, very quiet. Only heard other people the next morning in the hallway. For the price we paid, this was a good value. CONS: Here are the reasons I had to take points off. a) The extras fee. That's a bad idea - customers leave your establishment with a bad taste. b) The front desk attendants: Here's a thought: if two people approach the desk together, don't speak only to one person, totally ignoring the other. When we were given our room key, the clerk said to my husband \"Welcome Mr. Smith\" and there was no welcome for or acknowledgment of me. Nice customer service! c) It was weird that we had to drive through a neighborhood - small but neat mid-age homes. The driveway entrance was strange - a little unclear on what to do. d) We tried to use the concierge - no one was at the desk. Maybe it was a weird time - an hour or two before dinner. (wink) We had NO earthly idea of the dining establishments in the area and drove for about an hour before settling on a \"chain\" (which is what we were trying to avoid). e) The valets, when they had nothing to do, chatted away inappropriately (it was difficult not to eavesdrop) about subjects that particularly female customers shouldn't be subjected to.
