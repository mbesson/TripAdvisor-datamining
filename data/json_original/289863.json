The only other problem was that our neighbours liked to shower at about 3 in the morning and you could hear them!

We'd hunted round for something with a bit of character whilst still providing the Modern conveniences of modern hotels. We were not disappointed. As many others have said, this is more of a guest house than a hotel. There are no porters or room service. It occupies half of the 1st floor of a block of residential apartments. You arrive to an innoculous looking doorway and wonder if you're at the right place. Don't panic though - you just need to press the \"Residenza A\" buzzer and someone will come down and let you in. As is is a small business, reception closes at 10pm - if you're going to arrive after this time, you'll need to contact them to let them know so they can arrange to be there to let you in! Our flight was delayed meaning we got there at 10:45 - fortunately there was someone there, but he wasn't impressed (until we explained about the delay). The staff at the hotel are very welcoming and will do anthing they can to make your trip enjoyable. Top tip - contact the hotel in advance to arrange a car to collect you at the airport. We flew into Fiumicino airport and had to pay \u20ac60 (fixed price) for a cab to get into central Rome (which was terrifying!). On the way back the hotel arranged a car (nice comfy Mercedes) to take us back costing just \u20ac45 (again fixed price). We were given room ML which is at the front of the hotel. We had no problem with noise from the road outside, and it was quite nice to watch the world go by on the street below and people coming and going from Cafe Strega. We did notice that there was quite a bit of light still coming into the room from outside during the night, but the next morning discovered that there is a switch outside the window to turn off the flourescent light which illuminates the hotel name etched onto the window. The room was a good size and comfortable and the bathroom modern and clean. The decor was fresh and modern and the individual art that arorned the walls in the room and the corridor gave it a nice individual feel. The Apple Mac computer was very useful for checking email and booking restaurants during our stay. My only critisism is that the internet browser software could do with upgrading as it was struggling with a few of the more modern websites we were accessing. The DVD player in the room was a nice touch, however the rental list at reception was a bit limited. I recommend bringing your own films if you want to use this facility (obviously European region discs only..) As with every other mainland European hotel we've stayed in, the choice of English speaking TV channels is limited to just one (in this case CNN), but it wasn't an issue for us, as we weren't there to watch TV. The breakfast was included and I would say was the only weak point. The toast was toasted on one side only and seemed to be cold every morning. Also being british we like our tea, which lead to all sorts of confusion when we requested milk to go with it. One day I ordered cereal and again - no milk! Also Italian croissants aren't like French style ones, they come covered in icing sugar and often pre-filled with a fruit filling - very odd.. At the end of the day we put it down to the Italians just doing things differently - it wasn't a major issue for us. The hotel is well located for getting around Rome. Barberlini metro station is a 5 minute walk (downhill) and about 7 mins back (uphill). All the major sights are walkable - we tended to walk in the morning and get the metro home in the evening.

They'll also make reservations for you to go to Galleria Borghese and get the tix for you, which is GREAT.

The hotel is a converted apartment. Reception is manned from 7am to 10pm. Very helpful. With seven rooms the guys are not to busy and are happy to help. Bathrooms swish and well cleaned. Very nice toiletries (Bulgari) that your wife might decide to keep instead! Excellent shower. Rooms smartly furnished and in good shape. Painted white and walls spotless so must be painted regularly. Noise not a problem as our room faced inwards and it was off season. I think that even in high season it would not be as noisy as where we stayed near the spanish steps the last time. Limited breakfast, served in room or at the cafe next door. Nice cafe, excellent service. Would recommend the cafe. Breakfast in the room was ok, but I need more than one coffee. Toast was only toasted on one side and seemed too much bother to ask to remedy. Had a nice dinner in the cafe. About the same cost as anywhere on Via Veneto and a nice short walk to the hotel. The limited service is not a problem. Via Veneto is stuffed with fancy hotels and bars which you can use if you want. Very american street (hamburgers on most menus). Not the best atmosphere or shopping but liked it for being close to but away from the hustle of the spanish steps. Taxi rank very close by the Westin and paid 7.50 to get to St Peters and the Colosseum and 4.50 to the spanish steps (10 min walk). (Taxis irritating, change is a problem, award themselves 20/30% tips if you are not careful - have change!). Got the hotel to arrange a car to the airpost. Cost 50 euro which is 10 more than the taxi flat fare. Worth it for the mercedes, friendly driver and convenience. Reasonable supermarket in subway to spanish steps metro for essentials.

It was the main highlight of our tour of Rome. Although the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Vatican are iconic, the Galleria Borghese was much more enjoyable. Have Salvatore prebook the tickets for you (when we got there, the museum was fully booked for the next 4 days) and make sure you go on the English guided tour, really a must to fully appreciate the treasures of the museum, esp. Bernini's masterpieces. Location wise, its near the spanish steps and the main shopping district yet quieter and you dont have loads of people walking by the street, which we liked.

On the first floor of the building you enter a small room, this is reception and then there is a corridor leading of it with the first room door visible to all that enter the reception area.

It is the location, as soon as you open the door you look straight at the bed and the line of sight and noise from the reception area is quite unsettling, this is not helped by the size of the room its fine for one person, but feels too small for two and the road is noisy so go for one facing the inside of the building.
