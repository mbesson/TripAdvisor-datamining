There is good use of the space, however, with ample room for storage and all comforts. The Hotel staff were consistently friendly and professional.

We had visited Venice twice before this trip, and had a good idea of what to expect in terms of location and access to the major sites (the #41 vaporetto leaving the train station is typically ignored by tourists who want to go down the Grand Canal, but this line takes half the time, is less crowded and drops you off about 100 yards from the front door of the hotel... and it doesn't get easier than that in Venice unless you hire a private water taxi!). However, we had no way of knowing how well appointed this hotel would be, or how well we would be treated by the staff... and I do mean everyone from the front desk managers to the house keeper to the host at breakfast. They welcomed us warmly, quickly learned our interests and preferences, and offered excellent recommendations for dining, shopping and site seeing. In fact I had researched what I thought were some of the best restaurants in the city, but the front desk booked us at two restaurants during our stay that were far better than anything I had found online.

Going back in 2012, with our two children (how things change!) we were so excited to hear that it has been recently been redone into a luxury, 4 star property. The View: This hotel is on the lagoon and next to one of the canals. The views are amazing from each room. Basta. The Location: 5 minute walk from the Arsenale water taxi stop, 10 minutes to Saint Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square. Also the area around the hotel, in the Castello neighborhood, offered a more local flavor of shops, wine bars and restaurants. Close enough to all of the Venice sights, but then removed from the throngs of people in the afternoon, evening. The Rooms: We had an outstanding stay and were able to secure the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family suite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which is two adjoining rooms (305-306) and provided one larger room with a small sitting area and then a slightly smaller, standard room. Together it provided a very healthy amount of space (especially in Venice) and two bathrooms. The rooms were beautifully appointed and beds very comfortable. The bathrooms were very nice, but the water pressure had a bit to be desired \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but hey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you are in Venice! The Service: Was top notch. It feels like a small, family run hotel as we only dealt with 5 people over our 3 days and each was friendly, helpful and offered suggestions and information on any questions we had. We loved Stefan! Breakfast: the food provided was very good and typical quality, continental fair. Fresh baked roles, cereals, juice, fruit, yogurt, cold ham, turkey and cheese. Included are great espresso based drinks, tea and coffee. For a reasonable additional cost, hot options were available.

We were given room #406. We put our bags, had a quick wash and left the hotel. Before heading out we asked the concierge (not sure of his name, but he is an older man and apparently the manager too) for some recommendations for quick bite as well for dinner and anything interesting that we should do in Venice over 3 days. His verbatim response for food was \"everything is good around here, you can walk to the left or right of the hotel\". Quite a similar response for sightseeing...\"you should walk around and take a look yourself\" and he handed us the map. We felt it was quite weird since we had a great experience in Florence from where we just landed. We came back a few hours later and I went in to take a shower. I kept the shower on cold and it started with luke warm water. I thought it would adjust the temperature, though it kept increasing the water temperature to a limit that it was boiling and i had to rush out of the shower. Called the concierge and was told the manager will only be available next day AM and decide the course of action. I was almost burnt, wife had yet to take a shower and the guy did not care at all. I asked him if we can be moved to another room , answer was \"we are completely booked\". Weird because we saw couple of people checking out when we came back to the hotel. I asked if he could call the manager on his cell and find out what options are available, the answer was \"the manager cannot be reached under any circumstances once he leaves and any guest issues can only be addressed in the AM\" the time that I was having this discussion was 5:30 PM. Apparently i believe the manager leaves around 3 PM and comes back next day at 7:30 AM. The curt and rude responses by this hotel staff were shocking to say the least. I was told that the manager/concierge will be back at 7:30 AM and will immediately look into our issue. We woke up at 8:45 AM and there was no call from the manager. We stepped down and asked the manager as to what corrective action is being taken. There was no apology at all, the response was \" we are totally booked and can have a another room only by noon.\" We came back in the afternoon and they moved us to room # 303, which was way smaller than the prior room. I checked the bathroom functions and yes the water temperature was fine but the so-called rain shower was slow as a trickle. On being questioned about the size, the response was \"its a similar room.\" The shocking piece is that these guys cannot get their act together with only a 20 room hotel. Also, even more shocking is that this was a 2011 Trip Advisor European favorite!! We travel every year to Europe and have been to Switzerland, Spain, UK, Scotland, France, Belgium, and have never come across this kind of customer service. It was like there was a purpose it served for them to frustrate us. Pros: breakfast buffet and location. Also, the room are not mosquito free!!!

We pre-paid for our room one year in advance. Upon arrival, everything seemed standard, although we were told that our prepayment did not include all taxes as our receipt had stated. A new tax had been instituted in August 2011 and we were now required to pay it. I understand new taxes, however, since we had pre-paid and had a receipt stating all was paid in full, in advance, integrity would dictate that they pay that tax instead of us. However, they did not. We booked a jr. suite corner room and upon arrival it was identical to the photos on the site so as far as room appearance, it was as expected. The room was small (expected), the bathroom has no counter space (disappointing), bath towels are hung IN the shower (wonderful for the second person taking a shower) but overall was adequate. The bed was very hard- somewhat standard for average European hotels. Having had back surgery in May 2011, I came prepared with medications, but even with the medications, it was only after we returned that my back felt good again. If you suffer back issues, I recommend finding another hotel with back friendly beds. Upon return to the room on our second day, we found our hair brushes and curling iron IN the bidet, left there by the housekeeping staff. Our personal items had also been re-arranged and gone through. re: the bidet: I do not care how clean a bidet is, it is NOT sterile enough to store items that one uses on their hair. We brought this problem to the hotel's attention, and although they \"fixed\" it, they obviously did not understand why we were upset that our hygiene products were in the bidet. I threw my hairbrush away and bought a new one at the beauty store down the street.. and stored it in my zipped suitcase from there on out. Not even an apology for this happening. re: our personal items: I don't care how messy a guest in a hotel wants to store their items, there is never any excuse for cleaning staff to touch anything, ever. It is an invasion of the little privacy one has when staying in a hotel. The previous experience also told us that although the hotel is advertised as having English-speaking staff, it is only to a point. As people who knew very little Italian, we should have gone to a more internationally-friendly hotel. The front desk staff was inconsistent. Sometimes very friendly, sometimes curt, sometimes overly sales-pitchy. When asked for a reference for a restaurant, in all of Venice, they only recommended one. When asked if there were others they recommended, they informed us the one they had told us was the only one they recommended. Very odd and a turn off as far as service goes. We got to know many locals while we were there and recommend doing the same. They gave us the best recommendations for everything, not the hotel. Wi-fi service is given out in 24 hour increments instead of the extent of your stay. It is also given per person, so if you and your spouse both have phones that need to connect to Wi-fi, you will need two IDs and passwords issued. If you have a third item such as an IPad and there is only two of you in the room, you are out of luck for the third item. We had to get a new code every 24 hours the entire two week stay. It was only the last two days that they finally issued it for 48 hours, so they can issue it for longer and we recommend asking for that up front. The Wi-fi is also sketchy.. on the 4th floor, we were barely in range. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. We did not find it adequately reliable in keeping in touch with our daughter back home. The views are beautiful. The location is fantastic.. quiet.. on the edge of Venice between the locals neighborhoods and the busy tourist hubs The mini-bar is limited on snacks. One airplane sized peanuts and one potato chips. We recommend hitting the local convenience stores if you want to do midnight snacking as not only is it limited, but even more expensive than your average mini-bar. There is no coffee in the rooms, but there is a hot water teapot and teas. Apparently, coffee is only available with the breakfasts downstairs. You can get breakfast brought to your room for an extra fee. It is limited to a continental style meal with options such as scrambled eggs. It is fine for the convenience of having breakfast \"in bed\" but don't expect anything special. Also, check what you receive. On differing days, we got one order of eggs when we ordered two, and another day we received two pepper shakers and no salt with our meal. Attention to detail is a little sad. On many occasions, we received no answer when calling reception. There was also no voice mail to leave a message. This is unacceptable in any hotel. The concierge should always be available. Use the vaparetto to go to Murano. The reception will try to sell you on the \"free private taxi\" but remember, if you take the vaparetto, you are in charge of where you go, how long you stay and what you see.. which is a much better way to see Murano. Funny how there is no private taxi provided anywhere else. Speaking of taxis, despite the website stating \"transfer to/from airport\", we were unable to find this service. Be aware of when your plane goes out... ours left at 6:50 am... the perfect time where you are too late to catch the night vaparetto and too early to catch the normal ones. $110 euro one-way to the airport (about $150 US). Too bad that private water taxi to Murano couldn't be used for the airport. I'm certain guests would be much more appreciative of a ride to the airport than to Murano. Upon leaving, the concierge apologized profusely for overcharging us for one night. He gave us a receipt detailing all charges, which resulted in us being owed 128.50 euro. He said he could not take care of it at the moment but would get a refund issued to us asap. Not an hour ago, we received an e-mail now stating that we owe them 232.50 euros for the mini bar items and our in-room breakfasts whereas before, because of the overcharge of 361 euros, they owed us. Them owing us 128.50 euro is correct. Accounting seems to be lacking at this hotel as well. Review your bill carefully. Having traveled extensively worldwide and a good deal of that being in European countries, I can not in good conscience give this hotel anything better than two stars. The view and location are all I can see it getting four stars for. The rest is just average at best.

The staff are wonderful with great tips on where to eat and what to do. HOWEVER.... they will arrange a free taxi trip to the glass factories, but be prepared for some AGGRESSIVE selling while you're there.

We booked it based on the reviews here on Tripadvisor, and we were cautiously hopeful that we had made the right choice. I'll start with the good, then get to the not so good. The hotel is only a few years old, so everything is basically clean and new. The rooms have an interesting nautical theme, that you'll either love or not. (We enjoyed the theme). The location is great. It's not in or next to St. Mark's square, so it's more quiet and less hectic than the many hotels in the touristy heart of the city. But, it's about an 8 minute walk to all the action of St. Mark's, so it's easy to get there when you want to. There's a great gelato store right next to the hotel that we visited once or twice a day, and there are many restaurants on a street just over the bridge near the hotel. Our room rate also included breakfast, which was quite good, although basic, and sometimes crowded, but it was a great way to start the day. I would also add that housekeeping does a great job. The hotel and the rooms were spotless, and remained that way throughout our stay. Now for the not so good. We arrived in early September, when it was quite hot and humid in Venice. One of our three rooms was brutally hot. We notified the front desk, who tried rebooting the air conditioning in that room, but when we returned from our dinner that first night, the room in question was even hotter and more humid. We informed the front desk of the issue, but they said they were sold out (the hotel only has 20 rooms), and that nothing could be done until the morning, when a different room would be found. Needless to say, even with the windows open, it was nearly impossible to sleep in that room our first night there. The hotel did move us the next morning, but that was a bit late for us. To make matters worse, the attitude of the staff seemed to change quite a bit (for the worse) following the incident with our room that first night. The friendly and helpful front desk became noticeably less friendly and less helpful. I suppose we could have just imagined this, but I don't think so. I suspect they were not pleased with the \"trouble\" we caused by complaining about a stifling hot room that first night. After that night, the warm welcome we got when we first checked in was nowhere to be seen the following three nights. Also, there is no concierge at this small, boutique hotel, so the front desk staff (see above) are the only source for recommendations, and they were sorely lacking in useful or helpful advice from that point forward. I will say that once we got the new room, the air conditioning worked quite well from that point onward. I would have preferred that the hotel find us an alternative place to stay that first night, but that was not offered. Even worse, as we had 3 rooms for 4 nights, they should have offered to not charge us for that one room for the first night, but again, that did not happen. So, to summarize, this is a new hotel in a great location, with a good breakfast buffet. If you don't mind the chance of having air conditioning issues in the summer, and more importantly if you don't mind basically being on your own with respect to recommendations and other concierge types of services, then stay here and you'll be fine. And, to be honest, I would say the good outweighs the bad overall, but just be aware of the issues discussed above.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel, though not luxury.\u201d", "Author": "IvanVL", "ReviewID": "UR118014688", "Content": "Clean, well situated, small hotel at 500 m from San Marco.

Overall, the looks of the hotel are amazing - we really liked the fact that all interiors are done in a classical, but more modern style (that is, no museum-like pieces of furniture reminiscent of the 19th century France). The bathroom laid with marble was also spectacular. The Junior Suite we had wasn't large, but wasn't small, either - the size was just about right for us. Similarly, the location was to die for - four views of the lagoon and the shore, along with San Marco square in the distance (see pictures). The staff was also very friendly and very attentive. Just as a note, you might hear some noises at night of moored ships hitting each other while floating on the waves - however, the sound insulation in the room is very good, and it didn't bother us at all. In our view, it's a tiny price to pay for the incredible view. However, the one big disappointment was the included breakfast. There were no eggs beyond plain, cold, hard-boiled ones on the counter. No sausages, no bacon, and you had to pay 6 euros for an omelet (8 if you want ham in it) which was frankly sub-par. The selection of deli meats was also not very tasty or inspiring. There was also some prepackaged yogurt available, and some cereals. The exceptions were the fruit salad and croissants - both very good, but that doesn't make a complete breakfast.

It is towards one end of the popular main promenade along the Lagoon, which leads directly to San Marco square. Its about a 15 minute walk. The views from the hotel were gorgeous and the breeze off of the lagoon was refreshing in the Summer heat. Our room was very spacious - we booked a junior suite. And it was ultra clean; even with cream colored fabric decor. The bedding was fresh and spotless. I slept very well -- the mattress was too firm for my husband but most Eurpoean hotel beds are.

The hotel was chosen on our travel agent's recommendation, with help from TA reviews. Few things about the hotel: -easy access either with a water taxi from the airport (this is what we chose - 100 eur / each way) or by public transport - Alilaguna; -very quick check in (we arrived with an early flight) - at 10 we were at the hotel, and in spite of that our room was ready! -very clean room (hotel in general); -rooms-normal size (not too tiny, not too big) - navy style decorated (as on the ship Bucintoro - hence the hotel's name). Minibar well stocked; -cleaning service - very good, beds well made, enough toiletry products (shampoo, shower gel, moisturizer etc.); -breakfast - satisfactory: 2 kinds of ham, 1 salami, 3 cheese, roll breads, 2 types of croissants, cereals and fresh fruit, fruit salad, yoghurt, coffee / tea / capuccino, 2 / 3 types of home made tarts, boiled eggs (for omellette you pay extra), milk, 3 types of juices, gems and all kinds of sweets (chocolate etc). -staff-very helpful and receptive; -internet point near the reception (one computer); -free umbrellas at the disposal of the guests; -fast check out service. Hotel surroundings: ice cream shop and bar (with various types of sandwiches, alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks) just steps near the hotel (on the left side as you walk out the hotel). Also there are lots of cafes and restaurants in the vecinity of the hotel (either on Garibaldi street - on the left - crossing the first bridge as you leave the hotel, either walking to St. Mark's square - on the right as you leave the hotel). Avoid restaurants and shops in the near vecinity of Rialto and St. Mark's (high prices - not justified). Recommended bars / restaurants: -Bacaro Jazz - in the Rialto area - not too pricy - very fun bar - lots of bras hanging from the ceiling ;) and very good quality music! -Perla Nera (just near the hotel, on via Garibaldi - on the left hand side) - I recommend the Cozze alla Venetiana, risotto with fish and the turbot fish! -Pizzeria da Roberto (for very tasty pizza). Basically all restaurants that we ate in are great, all types of dishes we ordered were perfect (try all the fish types and sea fruits: you won't regret it). Recommended places to visit: -we particularly enjoyed our trip to Burano (lovely island, very colourful, with impressive little streets and vividly coloured houses, great little family shops and taverns) - take the public transport - from Arsenale to Murano (which is not so great as Burano but worth spending an hour or so - Glass Museum + central square), and then the LN line to Burano; -climb the campanille of San Giorgio (6 EUR), rather than the busy one from St. Mark's - better views from here (as you can also see St. Mark's square), no standing for tens of minutes in line... -try to walk as much as you can on the wonderful streets of Venice, rather than using the public transport - it's quite slow and very crowded...plus you get to see so much more on foot than from the boat. Food and drinks: -as for drinks: prosecco (if you like sparkling wine), spritz con aperol (good drink during the day - refreshing not too strong), Soave and Greco di Tufo wines (price may vary for a bottle from 18 to 35 eur depending on the restaurant / bar); -food: as I am a great lover of sea food and fish I've tasted almost all sorts of fish - all are exceptionally prepared! Don't miss the gamberi alla griglia, cozze (alla venetiana or in garlic sauce), sardine saore (marinated sardines), fegatto alla veneziana (veal liver) con polenta, grilled sea food (everything is fresh and yummy), sepie alla griglia. For spaghetti: I have only tasted black ink pasta (it was delicious!!) and penne a quattro formaggi (also delicious!). Sweets: the famous tiramisu (of course ;)) and try the biscotti venetiani!!! Try to avoid the crowded spots as it takes away from the beauty of the city... Enjoy Venice!

It also meant that the neighborhood was quiet at night, since St. Mark's Square is about a 15-minute walk. The hotel is beautifully decorated in a naval theme (bucintoro is the name of the Doge's barge). Our fourth floor room had an unforgettable view of the Grand Canal past St. Mark's Square. We could easily see the Campanile, the Doge's Palace and the top of St. Mark's Basilica. The service at Hotel Bucintoro superb in every respect. The cafe serves a generous complimentary buffet of breakfast foods: coffees, juices, breads, meats, cheeses, eggs, cereal, and all the best condiments. The staff is very attentive: Giancarlo and Stefano are very knowledgeable and helped us retrieve lost luggage, buy tickets to a Vivaldi performance at San Vidal, and change the pick-up time for the water taxi, when the time of our flight home was changed by the airline.

You will not be disapointed. The location was excellent, we chose to take the Agililuna (water boat) from the airport (25 euro each return) and this stopped at the Arsenale stop 150 meters from the hotel so could not have been easier to find. The first impression we recieved was excellent, the staff very friendly and professional and very helpful. Our room was one of the smallest but still had the most fantastic view directly over the central canal. The room was very clean and stylish. Breakfast is from 7am to 10.30am and is brilliant and of the highest standards. The breakfast staff are as professional and kind as all of the other staff we met. Turn right out of the hotel and within 5 mins you are at St Marks square via numerous eating places. Avoid these places to eat as they are ordinary and a beer is around 8 euro. Eating and drinking in Venice is expensive but you can find lovely authentiic food by wandering away from the large squares. There are also lots of \"sandwich\" places where you can buy a wrap or pannini for around 3 - 4 euros and these are excellent. The local spritz of prosecco and a ginger mix with ice is to be recommended. Expect to pay around 25 euro for a bottle of pino but you can find this much cheaper say 15 euro by looking around. The best meal we had was at Taverna San Lio behind St Marks square this is modern traditional venician food and very reasonably priced, including wine at 15euros! Venice is fabulous but wear very comfortable shoes as we walked around 25 miles over 4 days.

To be helpful - I'll right the Pros, then the Cons: Pros: *CLEAN!! Extremely clean - everything from the elevators to the guest room to the bathroom. *Friendly Staff - Everyone extremely nice and helpful. No issues with a language barrier, our Italian is not great - but the staff were almost all bilingual. *Breakfast - \"Continental Breakfast\" was amazing! Juices, fruits, yogurts, cereals, cappuccino, espresso, latte, etc., hard boiled eggs, pastries, breads. Hot items available for a small fee. Lady who was the breakfast employee was friendly and smiling all the time. Great experience! *Windows opened, view on to the canal and the square -- lovely! Cons: *Bed is as hard as a board. I like a firm bed...but -- this was crazy. We ended up folding the coverlet into thirds and my husband slept on that on top of the mattress. The maid kept apologizing when we asked for the coverlet -- she said she heard the \"bed complaint\" all the time. *Warm water -- Shower never went above \"warm\". Didn't matter what time of day, night, or duration of shower. *Water pressure -- very low. Tough to rinse soap off, wash hair. The rainfall showerhead was nice, but -- no water pressure. *Air Conditioner -- 3 fan settings, the \"high\" setting rattled to a point that you couldn't use it. Maintenance came up and said the solution was only to use \"low\" & \"medium\". *Desk agent offered the \"hotel taxi\" to take us to Murano. He went out of his way to say it was a hotel service & it was \"his pleasure to offer\". Only when we got to Murano did we realize this was a glass factory sponsored taxi and we had to take a tour -- big pressure to buy. If we didn't buy anything, we had to figure out our own way back. Wish the desk agent had been up front about this -- not a nice surprise to have. *The hotel describes the location as in the Center of Venice...not quite -- it's about a 1/4 mile from St. Mark's Square -- more on the outskirts of the City while still on the island. We're pretty fit -- so, no big deal for us -- but, now that we know the City, we'll stay closer to the \"center\". Overall - a good hotel.

The shower, however, lacked water pressure. The hotel common areas are fine and the breakfast is good, but not great. The service lacks personal and that was an issue for us in one particular situation: in our first night we found out that our tv only showed french tv channels, so we called the reception and a few minutes later the same staff member that was in the reception minutes earlier came to our room and could not fix it. He said that it happened because previous french guests had deprogrammed the cable tv to watch public french tv(?!).

A truly beautiful, small boutique hotel with amazing rooms and stunning marble bathrooms. We picked this hotel because it guaranteed a canal view room for a very good price. We stayed in a classic room which we thought was perfectly adequate for our stay. The beds were comfortable and the attention to detail of the fixtures and fittings made it an intimate, pleasurable and luxurious experience. The location of this hotel is perfect. A walkable distance to San Marco meant that we didn't need to buy the 3 day vaparetto pass but it's also very close to the Vaparetto stops when you are coming and leaving from either the train station or the airport. As the hotel is on the grand canal, it means that the hotel is very easy to find. When we were leaving, we managed to take a peak at the suite next to our room. The lay out of this room meant that you had a view of the canal from your bed and there was a separate area where you could drink wine whilst admiring the view. Worth the price if you have the extra cash! Things that could be improved: - The staff were abrupt and didn't look like they cared much about us but this may be typical of Venice and not particular to this hotel. - The room had a slight cigarette smell when we arrived. We kept the windows open when we went out for food and this helped but probably not a good idea if you have valuables in the room! - The quality of the breakfast food was good but we would have liked more variety and wished that the hot food wasn't so expensive to order but again, this may also be typical to Venice - There weren't many English TV channels I still think that it's a great hotel though and would definitely recommend it to my best friends!", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cStay Here--perfect distance from San Marco, close to less-touristy areas\u201d", "Author": "Sirk98", "ReviewID": "UR96256467", "Content": "Aside from having an awkward entrance/front desk setup and a slightly irritating shower setup, I have nothing but praise for Bucintoro and its staff The lobby may be modest, but the rooms are beautiful!

The views were breathtaking, and it was extraordinary to watch enormous cruise ships pass by our window in the morning. Comfortable sleeping, on the other hand, left much to be desired. The beds were the hardest I had ever experienced. One other con was the fact that, on our check-out date, the elevator broke. I had sprained my ankle the night before, so it was unfortunate to hobble up and down for breakfast and bags without the luxury of the lift. On the plus side, the breakfast that I mentioned was a great spread with juices, meats, yogurts, fresh fruit, fruit salad, cereal, biscuits, etc. The morning wait staff was always pleasant and cheerful. One little antecdote: at around 7:00 a.m. each morning, I would wake up to the divine scents of freshly-baked pastries. It smelled like heaven. The rate was pretty expensive -- but it is Venice, afterall. That said, I would still recommend this hotel if it was within the budget.

The Bucintoro is relatively close to the Arsenale Vaporetto stop, though you must cross a bridge to access the hotel (which is difficult with luggage). The location is more tranquil than San Marco, though rather removed from the main sights. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s d\u00c3\u00a9cor is very stylish, in a luxe, nautical theme, which was a nice variation from the overly rich and cluttered traditional Venetian style. First impressions of the property were mixed. It has a charming, if slightly Spartan fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, with a less than grand entrance into the \"lobby\". The hotel's \"lobby\" is really only three feet of space between the entrance and the reception desk, and the bar is located within the breakfast room. Throughout our stay, we did not see a single doorman or porter, and we were not given assistance with our luggage upon arrival or on departure to the water taxi. The hotel's signage is also rather poor, as the only street-level sign is a little plaque adjacent to the doorway, with tiny lettering. This proved to be slightly annoying while having breakfast on the terrace, as people who were not guests wandered in asking to be seated, thinking it was a restaurant. When we arrived in our room we were very underwhelmed. Our first room, No. 403, was located on the fourth floor. Though the view was incredible and we could see all the way across the basin, and down the harbor front, the room was absolutely tiny, not helped by the unusually low ceilings and oppressive wood paneling. The bathroom, though beautifully finished, was equally miniscule and did not have a bathtub. When we reserved (directly through the hotel's website), we explicitly requested two twin beds. The first room had only one bed, and as it was queen-sized, it could not be divided into two twins. When we notified reception of this issue, they did not apologize, said that we did not ask for twin beds in the first place, and told us that there was no availability that night to change rooms. We moved rooms the next morning to a much more satisfactory room on the second floor. Though it was even smaller (eight by ten feet at most), it had a higher, barrel-vaulted ceiling with very large windows opening onto the identical view as our previous room. Our second room, No. 203 had two beds and a bathtub. Though the second room was nicer, there were a few minor issues with both rooms. There were no drinking glasses in either room, just plastic cups; the beds and pillows were rock-hard, and very uncomfortable; and both rooms had hardly any furniture. Our second room had only two beds, two end tables, a side chair, and a tiny corner \"table\". On the plus side, the views from all points in the hotel were amazing, and having breakfast on the terrace was nice first thing in the morning, Breakfast itself was also very good and traditional. Again, the overall aesthetic of the property was unique, though a clever way to camouflage small rooms. Service was mostly good, though the concierge was not top-notch. I would not rely on his advice concerning restaurants, as he sent us to a very touristy place right on the lagoon with average food. I booked the Hotel Bucintoro mostly due to the extremely positive reviews on this website, and its expansive view of St. Mark's Basin, and it lived up to only part of its pretext. Upon my return home, I discovered that the hotel emailed, blatantly requesting I write a positive review on TripAdvisor. I found this insulting and off-putting. To ask for a review is acceptable, but to practically demand a positive review is not. I now know how they have obtained their 98% traveler \u00e2\u20ac\u0153satisfaction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rating.

From the moment we arrived, we knew we had made a great selection. The hotel is very clean, the rooms nicely furnished, the location wonderful for touring, and the staff could not have been nicer. The concierge Gianmaria let us check in early - around 10:30 am. This was a great relief after an overnight flight. Gianmaria was friendly and helpful. We were then shown to our room by another friendly employee. Although we were familiar with the system of inserting a card into a slot to turn on the room's power, I thought it was considerate that he showed us how this worked and gave us a tour of all the bathroom facilities. He also delivered our bags promptly (the lift is a bit small, but adequate). We were pleasantly surprised by the room. Other reviewers warned that the rooms were small, so we were prepared for something very tiny. However, we found it to be adequately sized with two closet areas, with drawers for storage. We had two twin beds and two nightstands and a writing desk. There was a T.V. mounted to the wall. The bathroom was spacious with a shower/tub combo. It was very clean with nice marble flooring. The only negative comment is that the beds were VERY firm. Depending on your preference, you might like it, but it was not comfortable to me. The best thing about our room was the large window that opened to reveal breathtaking views of Piazza San Marco and the Isola di San Giorgio Maggiore. It was so nice to sit with the window open. We often turned off the air conditioning and enjoyed the breeze. However, when we did want the air conditioning it worked and cooled the room very quickly. The hotel is located in the Castello area of Venice, but is 10 - 15 minute walk away from St. Mark's Square. There is also a vaporetto stop just three small bridges away that services Piazzale Roma, Ferrovia, and all stops on the Grand Canal. This made all of our sightseeing outings very convenient. There is a closer one only one bridge away (Arsenale) when you come from the airport or train station and have luggage. Other reviewers have mentioned obstructed views due to a boat docked near the hotel. There was a yacht docked outside the hotel during our stay. Our view (room 202) was not impacted by this, but I did hear some guests complain. This seems to be an ongoing issue, so you may want to talk with the hotel staff when booking your room to ensure an unobstructed view. The breakfast buffet was very nice. The staff in the small bar was attentive and served a variety of espresso beverages, hot chocolate, and tea included in the breakfast (we had this as part of our room cost). The coffee was some of the best I have ever had. A special note about Gianmaria. I only saw him at the desk on our first day when we arrived and then once more late at night. He was very helpful both times, but really went out of his way to help me when a phone card I had purchased was not working. He tried dialing the number for me and even tried the Italian-language number several times. In the end, I wound up calling the States directly from the room. It turned out to be less expensive than the phone card! Thank you for all your help, Gianmaria! I cannot say enough about what a wonderful stay we had at Hotel Bucintoro.

I was concerned about the noise since it also had a connecting door to the next room. But it was very soundproof and we heard absolutely no noise except for the water noise and ships passing (the hotel was at maximum capacity). The room had two windows that opened (something rare in hotels these days!) to the lagoon/large canal. Fabulous. Although small, our room was immaculate and the bathroom to die for. The bathroom is all marble...from the wall to the ceiling to the floor! The only thing that would have made it more perfect would be to provide robes to the guests. We did get slippers! The staff was very pleasant and very helpful. We arrived Sunday expecting to visit St. Mark's square and it was suggested that we enjoy a trip to Murano instead as it was hot and crowded in the square. Our conceirage was so right!

I love the entire nautical theme, from the hallway lights that look like ship portholes to the restaurant that looks like a dining room you would find on a yacht. The staff is attentive and friendly. I also enjoyed my morning breakfast on the outdoor patio ideally situated on the canal where I could watch the city come to life before my eyes while sipping a cappuccino. One of the best features of the hotel is just a short distance (two bridges) from start of the busy tourist area where boatload of tourists arrive each morning and head west to St. Mark's square. I recommend room 404, a junior suite located on the top floor of building. By Venice standards, it is spacious with beautiful high-quality furnishing and a raised ceiling with exposed beams. The window coverings are tasteful and the wood panelling is beautiful. The bathroom is modest in size but it is well appointed. The best feature, however, are the four windows, two on the south side overlooking the laguna and two with spectacular views of St. Mark's and the entire waterfront along this side of Venice. Because of its location, you can see miles of the canal and literally hundreds of the buildings along the canal. I spent numerous hours just watching the city from a comfortable chair and ottoman in my room. I also slept several night with the windows open with a nice cross breeze but it can be a bit noisy due to the the wakes of passing ships causing boats docked outside to run against each other. But the sound of the lapping water was wonderful and since the hotel is away from the main tourist area, I never heard any rowdy late-night revelers. My only criticism is the bed including the mattress, bedding, and pillows. The bed is consists of two single beds pushed together so there is a crease down the middle. Also, the bed and two pillows were too firm for my standards.

We found this hotel on TripAdvisor and as with other tips we've used from them, they were right on target! This was a wonderful little place. We were prepared to be disappointed with Venice because of it's reputation for being so pricey and \"touristy\". Because of this hotel's location, those ideas were quickly dispelled. Located on the beautiful lagoon rather than the noisy, over-priced, and crowded Grand Canal, the Bucintoro offered the same charm and beauty of being on the water without the price, noise and crush of tourists. It's location right near a vaparetti stop made getting to and from the train station with our luggage a snap. We had bought a 72-hour vaparetti pass over the internet before we left home so we used it to go to(# 42) and from(#41) the train station and then took Vaparetti #1 all around to sight-see and experience the other parts of Venice and surrounding areas to our heart's content. It was great! We downloaded Rick Steve's free audio tours onto our i-Pods and \"toured\" the Grand Canal and other sights with him. Again, great! Our room at Hotel Bucintoro was lovely. Be sure and ask for a corner room. Ours was room #404 on the corner. It had four windows! Two looked out to St. Mark's and main Venice and two out to the lagoon. One morning we watched from our room as 3 cruise ships slipped silently past our windows. The rooms all are decorated in a nautical theme--very classy wood paneling. They are large and comfortable with extra seating. The breakfast was very good and the staff was friendly and very helpful. Breakfast was served in a cozy breakfast room or on a ground-floor terrace in front of the hotel looking out over the lagoon. For dinner we asked where the locals like to go and we were directed around the corner from the hotel to Via Garibaldi--a wide thoroughfare where we stepped into the real Venice with authentic Italian food and street life. With a sprinkling of neighborhood tratorias and hosterias, it was hard to choose from those suggested by hotel staff. It's best to have hotel staff make reservations as these are popular with locals. Our least favorite was Nuevo Galeone and most favorite was Hostaria All'Ombra. You'll find fresh local seafood and pastas prepared by Italians in creative and delicious ways. Be sure and walk this street during the early morning for a totally different prospective. You'll know you're in Italy! We were prepared for Venice to be really expensive but we found this hotel and this area reasonable and yet classy and charming.

You have various options when arriving at the airport, we took the Alilaguna, a 1 hour boat trip virtually to the door of the Hotel, the only way to see Venice, by water all the way. Really easy to find at the airport, come out of arrivals, turn left, you will see a sign for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Water Bus Alliaguna\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in front of you, follow the covered walkway for about 5 minutes, just past the sign for Water Taxis (these do look great and are priced at approx 100 Euro per 1 way trip) you will see a large kiosk \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alilaguna Lines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. To get the Hotel you will need the Arsenale stop on the Red Line, the cost was 13 Euro one way or you could buy a round trip ticket for 25 Euro. Worthwhile picking up a timetable at the kiosk, includes a good map as well as times. When you get off at the Arsenale stop, you are 2 minutes from the Hotel, turn right, over the bridge and it is there in front of you. You are not far from anything in Venice however we did really appreciate how little pulling of cases we needed to do, as we were so close to our Hotel. From start to finish the Hotel was fantastic, with a nautical theme throughout, the furnishings are of a high standard, wonderful dark would walls against spotless cream. When the porter took us to our room, he explained all the amenities and then with a final flourish opened the curtains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the view truly was amazing! We realised as we wandered around just how lucky we were to have such a fabulous view. We stayed in room 402, a classic room with a wonderful double window that we could watch the world go by from. The room was great, not huge, however really well designed, the bathroom spotless, nice deep bath and good powerful shower, high quality toiletries and soft fluffy towels. Breakfast was amazing, fabulous cold buffet with croissants, fruits, cereals, various types of breads, cold meats, cheese, hard boiled eggs, cakes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and really good coffee. At a supplement you could also have hot food. The weather for us was changeable, glorious sunshine and a fair bit of rain, the Hotel does provide umbrellas for guests and these were very welcome! Worth getting a vaporetto ticket for a couple of days so that you can see Venice by boat, so convenient! There are loads of restaurants around, it does depend on what you are looking for, watch out for the extras, cover charges can vary from 1 Euro per person to 4 Euro per person and at a lot of places a service charge of 12% is automatically added to your bill as well as the expectation of a 5% tip. We found a good restaurant that was packed out every night, their cover charge was 1 Euro per person and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge a service charge, all tips were at customers discretion - Taverna San Trovaso - 041 520 3703, From the Accademia bridge, head towards your right, walk down the first alley on your right turn left when you reach the canal. You'll pass the restaurant before you reach its entrance, keep looking back, we missed it first time. All in all a great stay. The Hotel was fantastic, I dread to think how much you would pay for a Hotel on the Grand Canal with limited views when you can have a luxurious stay at The Bucintoro with exceptional service, food, surroundings and of course views.

The location of the hotel is a 8-10 minute walk to St. Mark's Square. It is right on the water and just off the tourist path which is nice for a quiet room at night. If you are going to Venice, you should plan on doing some walking (obviously because there are no cars) and if you want to really enjoy the place, you need to explore all parts of the island.

Breakfast is a self service buffet, but there was a wide choice of fresh fruit, cake, rolls and jam, croissants, cheese etc. Each day we ate outside the hotel and watched the locals running (are they mad with all though bridges?!), walking to work and we even saw some of the cruise ships come past. While only a 15 minute walk to St Marks Square the hotel feels far enough away from the hustle and bustle to escape in the afternoons to recharge your batteries before setting out again.

The breakfast room is also small, but we never had to wait for a table so perhaps it is adequate. The cold food available on the buffet is pretty good and they do have cooked food to order, which I did on the first day, but it was not great so we stuck with the buffet after that. The major gripe we had was one which will probably not affect most people but I mention it for completeness.

You are about 10min walk (max) from St. Marks sq and there are many water bus stops that will take you anywhere in Venice. Nearset stop it right outside (Arsenale). (P.s . if your planning on getting to the hotel from Marco Polo airport get the water bus. Its 13euro p.p and takes an hour but the jounrey isnt too bad. If you miss the bus or dont fancy being with other passenges, the only other alternative is a water taxi. this will cost you 100euros though!!!!!!!!!!!!!) The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms had a great view of the city and were very clean. I stayed in a double room. The room itself is beautiifully decorated. The only real minor complaints was that the room was a little small (not much floor space) and the room doesnt come with coffee/tea making facilities. The fridge also didnt keep the items cold (maybe ours didnt work?). Also, if you are planning sleeping in all day, the TV channels are poor, especially if your english. No sports channels lads! Only BBC24 and MTV. The bathroom was massive though and very well decorated. We got complimentary slippers and bathrobes which my dolly (girlfriend) was very happy about!! The breafast which was included was good. Had choices of cereals, rolls, cheeses and yougouts (typical contiential breakfast). If you want eggs, bacon etc you would have to pay extra. The hotel however does not have a resturant for the evening so you have to dine out. Be warned, the resturants are very expensive, especially if you like your meat and fish!! The hotel also has the internet. Overall, i would definately recommend this hotel. Its not as expensive as some of the other 4* and 5* hotels we saw and looked at and its location and decor is excellent!

I booked the hotel through otel.com at a great average rate of only $190 per night which was lower than anywhere I found on the web. I booked based on excellent reviews on TA and the property's good location. Also the price was reasonable for a luxurious place. Our flight landed at Treviso airport at nearly 9PM and by the time we arrived at the hotel it was after 11. The man at the front desk by the name Andrea was extremely friendly and helpful. I asked if there was anywhere to get something to eat as it had been over six hours since we last ate. He called his girlfriend at a nearby restaurant to see if we could still be seated even though it was closed at 11. We were shown to our room and then walked a few minutes to the restaurant for a salad and a pizza which was quite nice. The place was full of locals as well! The service throughout the stay was excellent as we received helpful info on restaurants, transit etc. Also I was impressed that I was always addressed by last name. Our room was 303 and was very nice. The bed was large, and as is common in Italian hotels a bit on the firm side. The bathroom was of a nice size, had a good shower and contained good amenities. There were a good amount of TV channels including BBC and CNN in English. There was even an Italian sports channel which was airing the NFL playoff game. Lastly the view of the Grand Canal and St. Mark's was lovely! We ate the compimentary breakfast each morning which was pretty good. It consisted of some cold meats, cheeses, croissant and spreads, fresh fruit, cereals, juices, and a good coffee bar. Also they had eggs, bacon, etc. for an additional charge, however their standard offering was plenty sufficient. Another thing that I appreciated was the essentially unlimited complimentary internet access on a lobby computer. I only used it for a probably 30 minutes but it was great to have the ability to use it for longer (unlike the hotel I stayed at next in Rome). Finally, the location of the hotel was great. It was about 250 feet away from the Arsenale vaporetto stop (when getting off there simply turn right and cross the bridge and you will see the hotel soon). In addition you could easily walk to St. Mark's in under ten minutes. From there many sights are within easy walking distance. Lastly the area is much quieter and less touristy than those closer to St. Mark's, yet is still close enough to the touristy areas. The only negative (and its a minor one) was that there were loads of men selling knockoff purses near the hotel and along the walk to St. Mark's, but this was really not a problem, just thought I'd mention one negative. In conclusion, this hotel was a wonderful place to stay in Venice. Our visit came in January which was freezing, but also made for cheaper hotel prices and much less crowded sights. Do try and get lost and just explore the city as it allows you to truly be. Hope you found my review helpful and enjoy your trip to Venice. I'd love to go back again and would absolutely stay at Hotel Bucintoro again!", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cDelightful December\u201d", "Author": "Matt002", "ReviewID": "UR22677955", "Content": "We have just spent the most amazing weekend in Venice and are so glad that we chose this Hotel.

The location of the hotel was really good from that respect, with the walk to San Marco only taking about 20 minutes lesiurely stroll along the canal.

He arranged a private water taxi over there free of charge (a special thing as the hotel had just opened apparently), This proved to be a really good trip and made a nice change to the main island.
