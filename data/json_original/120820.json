The trolley is basicly across the street & the French Market a 2 minute walk. Plenty of options for meals/music in the area. I was worried that I had made a mistake bring an 11 & 12 year old to New Orleans, no reason to worry- it is very family friendly! The hotel pool looks really small in the photos they have online, but it wasn't bad. The kids were able to swim in it & enjoyed it. Free parking in the basement of the hotel was a definite plus!

This was our first trip to New Orleans and we had no idea what to expect - how far the hotel would be from where we wanted to visit, etc., and were very happily surprised. We arrived about 4 hours before check in and since our room was ready they let us check in. That truly allowed us to start our vacation the morning we arrived. We booked this as an exchange through Interval. The room was a 1 Br unit on the front of the building which was very quiet. The only noise we could hear inside was the occasional train going along the river. The rooms are not super large, but very clean and comfortable. Queen size bed in the bdrms with good closet and dresser storage, small sofa, table and chairs in the living room. The bath was kept very clean and the toiletries were of nice quality. The kitchenette is small but functional and had adequate glasses, etc. Ice manchine on each floor is very convenient. We loved the balcony on the 2nd floor overlooking Esplanade. At night you can hear music from the local clubs and relax with your drinks, there was seldom more than 2 other guests, if any, out there. There are also \"inside\" balconies\" outside each room that are really kind of neat with tables and chairs. These open atrium type hallways look down at the little splash pool or a garden. There is also a nice excercise room in the hotel. The walk to the French Market was about 3 minutes long, about the same to the streetcar stop. With the exception of one employee who took nasty to a whole new level, the staff is super nice and helpful. Housekeeping kept the room tidy and were quick to get you something you may need. If you want super fancy accomodations in the middle of the bars this may not be for you. But if you want clean, comfortable rooms with a great location I would not recommend anything else.

Hotel was very nice and airy. I loved the small pool with the fountain. We booked a double bedroom suite. Had a cute kitchenette, living room and dining table. We were in #307 and we got it through VRBO. Very pleased with the room for the price. Room was quiet and clean. Had a coffee maker with community coffee, glassware, silverware, plates, even pots and pans. Our room had a jacuzzi tub for the bath. The best part of the being here is the location. You are right at the corner of Frenchmen St. and Decatur. The French Market is right there and you are in the middle of everything. The only bad thing was parking. Yes, they do have free indoor parking but only like a dozen spaces. We were lucky one night to get in there. Because of the festival, there was absolutely no parking all weekend. I had to park the car about 10 blocks away. I wasn't really worried about it but still would be nice to have something closer. Be careful where you park, the police do not fool around. One day, I saw a line of cars with tickets on them. Another day, they booted and towed the car that was parked ahead of me, but too close to the corner. Overall, I would stay there again.

Our last visit included two teenagers who didn't really want to be traveling with their parents, and we were thrilled then to find a place with separate bedrooms and a living area within walking distance to everything. Now the kids are grown and it was just me and my husband for a romantic birthday trip for two. We didn't need a \"kid-friendly\" place and I wondered if I should have looked elsewhere before booking. My worries were needless. We loved this place just as much now as we did years ago. Yes, it's a little shabbier and the furniture is dated. But the front desk staff is just as helpful, and the interior courtyards are just as stunning. Having a full suite -- living/kitchen area, separate bedroom, separate bathroom -- is a real luxury for even two guests. Where can you get all that in the French Quarter for $144/night?! We loved being able to heat up leftovers for breakfast/lunch or prepare snacks in the kitchen, and it's nice having a separate bedroom when you're spending more than one night in a place. There's soft and ample lighting, comfortable sofa and chairs, and it's just really cozy. We didn't hear any night noise, either from nearby bars and restaurants or from within the hotel. In fact the hotel seems pretty insulated from the surrounding businesses. But it's really about location, location, location. Walk out the door, cross the street and you're in the French Market (one of those stalls sells the best bloody mary in the world!). We walked the French Quarter from one side to the other many times. We walked along the river, from the hotel to the big cruise ships docked by the Convention Center. We took the free ferry across the river. We grabbed the streetcar across the street for a trip to the garden district. Although we rented a car, we left it in the garage the whole time we were there. Next time we'll take a cab. There was just no reason to leave the neighborhood because we barely scratched the surface of what we could reach on foot in four full days. Our biggest surprise was the change to Frenchmen Street, just around the corner. On our last visit, this location on the fringe of the FQ was bordering the seedy side of town. Imagine our surprise when we arrived on this trip and the front desk clerk recommended a restaurant on Frenchman Street! We walked around the corner and heard live music coming out of every door, saw cabs dropping visitors off to trendy restaurants, and walked several blocks of lively, local, thriving nightlife scene. Incredible! No gigantic plastic neon drink glasses, no beads, no hawkers, no gawking tourists. Just great music, good food, and really positive energy. During our visit we spent a lot of time in the typical tourist areas of the FQ, but always appreciated returning to the authenticity of our hotel and the Frenchmen Street neighborhood. In summary, would I recommend this hotel to everyone? No. If you want a fancy highrise hotel with a big, glittery lobby, stay near the convention center. If you want a cute B & B with Victorian furniture and personal attention, find another place. But if you want a cozy, comfortable suite in charming hotel in a real neighborhood at a great price, this is the best!

Check out upstairs at Snug Harbor or Spotted Cat or BMC, all on Frenchman Street. After the first shower, we noticed that our tub was clogged up.

Yellow walls in the unit were cheerful, and the art on the walls was all on New Orleans events which I liked.Our favorite thing was the deep whirlpool bathtub ! We took fantastic bubble baths with the jacuzzi jets humming every night. There was a plaque on the bathtub wall warning us that the hot water tank held 30 gallons only. There were 4 adults in our party, and we never ran out of hot water. We just were careful not to take 4 showers in a row. We staggered our use.

One hot shower or bath depletes the hot water supply very quickly and the electric heater unit takes quite a while to replenish hot water.

The only drawback was an obnoxious woman named Carolyn who stationed herself in the lobby over the weekend to harass the guests into purchasing a timeshare from this property. She repeatedly called our room and accosted us in the lobby, attempting to ingratiate herself to us, and was absolutely impervious to any evidence of our disinclination to avail ourselves of her services. When I spoke with the front desk clerk about this woman, I learned that she is an independent real estate agent whom the hotel management or board permits to set up station on premises, and they allow her access to our names and room numbers, which felt like an inexcusable invasion of privacy to me.

Lovely second story exterior balcony adjacent to atrium with small wading pool and fountain (great spot to soak your feet after traipsing around the city) The room we were in was very small and like a step back into 1985, no, not 1885 but 1985 complete w/ an Amana Radarange (microwave?) that we were able to operate once and then unable to repeat the process ever again.

We are not large people by an stretch, but the layout was extremely uncomfortable. The furnishings are old and tired, not in a charming antique way, but just old and tired w/ sticking drawers. Once you got into the bed though it was very comfy. My partners major beef was the windows do not open so the only way to get fresh air was to prop front door open. Fortunately this was a timeshare exchange, so we stayed for next to nothing. The hotel personnel were very charming and helpful. The 2 bedroom (we saw from out on the second floor deck) looked great.

We had to wash our hair using a glass from the cupboard. We asked for another room, but they said that they were booked up. Thirdly, the staff was soooo rude! We had to deal with Steve (a night shift person) and when we asked if we could have a late checkout on Friday, he flat out said \"no\". He didn't even want to give us a reason as to why until we probed him a little more. Even with all of our troubles, he was completely unsympathetic and said he couldn't do it. It was only till we spoke with the women who took over his shift at night, that she gave us a late check out (still huffing and puffing as she agreed to it). Fourthly, I room was only cleaned 2x in 7 days, even when we asked the cleaning lady to come in and clean it. This was just a miserable experience!!! If you plan to have more than 3 people with you in the hotel room, don't stay here.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cNot a Hilton, but a cozy, quaint hotel\u201d", "Author": "SKPA", "ReviewID": "UR23024997", "Content": "We booked as an Extra Vacation through RCI and got an excellent rate -- less than $450 for 7 nights. For such a great price, we weren't expecting much. The hotel was much better than we had anticipated. Yes, it is outdated. Yes, the beds are a bit firm. Yes, it's kind of dark. Yes, it's not in the heart of the FQ. But yes, if you get a good deal, it's a gem in NOLA. We found most of the workers to be extremely nice. The person at the front desk was so nice to upgrade our room when we had paid for an extremely small room (hence, the deal we got). The cleaning staff was great, especially since NOLA required us to do a lot of sleeping in (still cleaned the room when we didn't leave until the afternoon). The jacuzzi tub wasn't the best but did its job. The pool in November was gated off, but wouldn't have been interested anyway. However, the mini-kitchen was enough for us to keep some bottled waters and leftovers and make some coffee. We got daily maid service even though we were on a timeshare, which was great. We found the hotel quaint, the workers nice, and the other owners we met were very nice as well. We were asked about purchasing a timeshare and couldn't do it, but we did get the information to pass on to some family and friends. The location is great, in my opinion. It is only a 10-minute walk to the middle of the FQ. Just head down Decatur to Cafe du Monde! We didn't explore it, but the Marigny is right near the hotel, as well as the French Market and Louisiana Pizza Kitchen, as someone else already mentioned. Don't expect a Hilton with numerous amenities and wait staff. If that's what you're looking for, go elsewhere. But if you're looking for a clean, small little hotel not in the middle of party central (party central is still close to get to), then this is a good choice. If you can get a decent rate, it's a pleasant place to stay.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Earth", "Title": "\u201cAnother great week!\u201d", "Author": "alaynadea", "ReviewID": "UR20709260", "Content": "Hotel de la Monnaie has two very important things going for it.

The decor in the rooms is a little dated. And the beds are a firm. BUT, everything is very clean. The bathrooms in the two rooms I've stayed in have both been very large, which is great. I love having a bedroom and living room to lounge in after a long day of walking around NOLA. The best deals on this hotel can be found if you are a time share owner looking to buy an escape week. We bought 7 nights at this property for under $400. At one point, we were called on our hotel phone and asked if we'd like to buy our own week at Hotel de la Monnaie.

This place was a perfect location and it definitely beat staying downtown at the Hilton with the rest of the attendees. We were right on the edge of the French Quarter withing walking distance of the whole area. The location on Esplanade is more of a residential area so you are near the fun but far enough away to enjoy some quiet downtime. We loved the trolly car right across the street and we took that down to the conference center for the conference days we attended. We also took it up Canal Street and nearly delivered to the WWII museum. From there we were able to catch a ride to the Garden District - a must see if you love old architecture - beautiful old homes(mansions). We at lunch ate Joey K's there and it was excellent. We ate so many places in the French Quarter I can't remember all the names. My husband loved all the NOL foods - gumbo, jambalya and more. I'm glad we found the Louisiana Pizza Kitchen right on the other side of the U.S. Mint (across the street from Monnaie). Small little spot but excellent pizza! The day we arrived was a huge jazz festival going on across the street. However, once in our rooms, you couldn't hear any outside noise. Just the train at night blowin it's whistle! We enjoyed being so close to the French Market and within walking distance of all the sites to see. And you can't pass up the Cafe du Monde down the street - a busy happenning place with the best French dougnuts!!!Delicious! We will defintely come back and would stay here again. We were not hounded to purchase anything. My husband only received one phone call regarding timeshare and the woman was very pleasant. The staff was laid back and friendly. My only complaint was the very firm bed. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay.

The rooms aren't terribly large, but they are clean and well kept. There's a refrigerator big enough to hold leftovers and sodas, a microwave and a coffee pot, along with a little sink. I liked that there was a couch and tv watching area that was separate from the bedroom. The bed was comfortable and the staff was pleasant. They consistently helped us find our way to different things we wanted to do and had great advice for us. We also really like that the parking is indoors and secured. We rarely took the car out, anyway. We just walked everywhere. They offered a GREAT deal on a timeshare that our friend shared with us and we snapped it up. We'll be going back every year (unless we want to trade with another property) and are looking forward to it.
