Now, read on and you'll see why the hostel wasn't worth it. - The first room given to us consisted of two bunk beds which you could not swing a cat in despite me ordering two single beds this was very disappointing. - The water system in the building is very old and we were subjected to a loud knocking noise from the water tank system all night! I barely got any sleep on the first night which made the day even more tiring given the level of sight seeing we undertook. We ended up not going out in the evening because of this. - Many of the shower/toilet rooms are cold and damp with very basic facilities. You end up hunting down the better showers down throughout the building as most are old showers being drippy. We were moved on the second night to a better room and were eventually given what we had ordered. On a lighter note, the rooms came with air con, heating and a TV with amazingly irrelevant and dare I say it. 'basic' channels.

DO NOT GO THERE!\u201d", "Author": "Nag72", "ReviewID": "UR89971568", "Content": "This is an illegal hotel as this place is actually a single room occupancy (SRO) building for permanent residents who are mostly poor people (rent: $200-$500/month). The owner of the building has been using emptying tactics (such as cutting the gas supply, threats of eviction, renting rooms to persons out of jail or mental hospital which led to shady stories and by that I mean the worst\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) so that those permanent residents leave the building (they often end up homeless\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) in order to use it as an hotel and make a greater profit than they can from the low-income tenants (30 times the rent per room depending on the room as we were paying $200/night). I know that because I met one the few tenants left in that building after an incident involving a huge cockroach who told me all about her 20-year-struggle to keep her room. I felt pretty bad participating in that evil plan to put poor people on the streets so that a greedy and cold-blooded landlord makes big bucks. This building is also unsanitary as there should be one person per room, but as they put as many tourists as they can in each room the shared bathroom is beyond filthy (not mention the staff is not really good at cleaning, if they actually clean\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). It also constitutes a real disturbance for the tenants whose privacy is invaded and lifestyle disturb by the constant presence of tourists. My friends and I had a room with a private bathroom (which was still not very clean\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). There were stains on our sheets (changed every 3 days) and on the towels. We also had cockroaches in our bedroom (I even found one on my bed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). There could also be fire and security hazards anytime as the outlets are not properly sealed to the wall and as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a SRO building, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comply with the fire code for commercial hotels. The paint on the wall was peeling off (and they never vacuumed it). I am also posting some pictures so that you can see the room. The staff is also very unhelpful and kind of shady and we could not trust them at all to resolve any kind of issues. It seemed you have to fight with them to get things done, and of course, whatever the problem is, they will never apologize. Undeniably the poorest customer service I have ever experienced. One of my friends lost her mobile phone in the lobby. When she asked the receptionist for it, he said they found it and that she will get it back. But then, they never gave it back to her because they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153apparently\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gave it to someone else. Go figure it out\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 One night, we could not take it anymore (the night I found the cockroach on my bed) so we argued with the receptionist until almost 1 a.m. to be moved to a decent hotel. Again, we ended up in illegal hotels owned by the same person who has 4 other buildings (we stayed at Marrakech hotel and Portland Square hotel). We found hair in the bathroom and stains on the sheets but overall it was better and cleaner, and we made sure we wouldn't have to pay for it. I still felt really bad to stay again in an illegal hotel but as we paid ahead we could not do anything about it. This is the short version of the story, but it was my first time in NYC, and Royal Park Hotel ruined a big part of my trip. This practice seems to be really common in NYC and a bill to put an end to illegal was passed last summer. Hotels in NYC are really expensive and next time I will go there I will rent a room or an apartment from New-Yorkers. There are plenty of ads on http://newyork.craigslist.org/vac/. I know some people say they had a good experience because they have renovated a couple of floors. But that's no excuse to book a room there.

We actually ended up thinking we should just stay at this other Hotel for the rest of the days, but eventually we didn't - and we're glad we haven't! Although the RPH lobby isn't the most attractive venue in town, and it could use some renovation, the room we were given was absolutely brilliant, fully renovated and with impeccable taste. The bathroom was (NY-standard) just huge, and the walk-in shower, besides being very big was also quite good. Bed was big enough, we had a closet with enough room for a lot of bags/luggage, and the bare-brick wall was just pitoresque. Sound-proofing was good (never any issue with noise or not being able to sleep), but it could be warmer (heaters available in the reception). The staff was young and helpful, and really went beyond their way to help. Definitely recommended - though, from what I saw, I wouldn't recommend the shared-bathroom rooms, unless you're sure they were renovated (they are slowly renovating the whole thing).

No TVs, no towel racks, no frills. On my list of priorities was Location, Security and Comfort. So how did it do? 1. Location - Hard to beat. Upper West Side is glorious and some of the bars around are some of the best in NYC (Cleopatra's Needle). The subway is a two minute walk and is on the express line, meaning your in Times Square very quickly. 2. Security - Not great. Our door had a lock that was, well, hard to lock. It didn't turn all the way and left a gap in the door. Not disastrous, but not great. Most worrying was the fact that around said lock, there was a crack that clearly indicated it has been kicked in at some point. The lock had simply been screwed back into the wood and perhaps most shockingly there was sticky tape around the cracks. Put simply - it was a concern for most of the trip. 3. Comfort - Fine, just fine. This category is perhaps more subjective, comfort for Paris Hilton is excessive for Joe Bloggs. However, the beds were good and the heating/cooling system, despite being too loud, worked. You get the BARE minimum, but if that's comfort for you, then it really is fine.

Western Brewing Company (Its a pub) friendly staff and have a 2-4-1 happy hour!!!! massive food portions. To get to the Hotel get the airport train into Jamaica Street Station $5 each, buy a $2 subway ticket each then get the E Line (Blue) subway to 50th Street station (just after 7th avenue stop) the jump on the A Line (Blue) subway and get off at 96th you will then need to walk from their 2 blocks away to the west from central park and your there!!!!!

The room we were given was not even a shadow of the pictures you see on their website. It was quite dirty, had electricity wires unsafely coming out of the wall, there were pieces of wall on the hallway floor, the room smelled unpleasant, the door wouldn't close well from inside. Fortunately, the sheets and the towels were clean. The room was so tiny that the only things it contained were the bed and a little old piece of furniture with drawers! There was no table, no chairs, no other furniture, no bedside lamp, no TV, no phone, there wasn't even a place to hang our clothes and towels, so we had to put them on our luggage that would barely fit in the room as well. Usually they would change the towels and make the bed except for one night of our stay. The shared bathrooms were relatively clean; however, in the morning all of them were busy, meaning all bathrooms on each and every floor. So unless you are willing to wake up before others, you'll have to wait a lot for a free bathroom. One of the guys at the reception was very friendly and available whereas the other one we met was rude and unwilling to help, so it depends on the person. Finally, one evening when we came back to the hotel there was a NYPD team in the hall. We saw one of them talking to the receptionist and others taking pictures around. So it felt like being in a crime scene! Of course, this is to be considered a PLUS! ;) The price is a bargain for NYC, but honestly, had we known about the difference between what we thought we had reserved and what we eventually got, we would surely have considered booking with a different hotel.
