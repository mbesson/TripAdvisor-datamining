The room and common areas were spotless and up-to-date, the front desk staff was helpful and friendly, and the hotel provided everything we needed and wanted (free parking, bathroom toiletries, microwave, mini-fridge, free wi-fi, free breakfast). The breakfast included apples, bananas, yogurt, fresh waffles (delicious!), bagels, toast, muffins, danishes, oatmeal, eggs, sausage, hash browns, juice, coffee, etc. The bed was so comfortable that we slept in every morning on our vacation! Our room was in the back building (#3), which was very quiet with absolutely no street noise. I only have one comment for travelers and one recommendation for the hotel: Travelers: Note that the area around the hotel is a bit \"rough\" with several strip clubs in the area. It's not the kind of area that I felt comfortable (or interested in) walking around. That said, the hotel itself and its grounds were secure and clean, so it was a great place to stay and take our rental car out and about in more desirable parts of San Diego. Hotel: The breakfast was delicious, but I do wish that meat was not mixed into the hot entrees (breakfast bagels with cheese, eggs, and ham; scrambled eggs with ham). Maybe you could offer ham on the side if people want to mix it into their eggs? I was also confused about the use of styrofoam plates at breakfast when there was so much emphasis on recycling at the hotel.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livermore, California", "Title": "\u201cConveniently located, comfortable rooms\u201d", "Author": "Dawn S", "ReviewID": "UR126398253", "Content": "This Hampton Inn was exactly as described in other reviews.

There is a Denny's next door, and around the corner there is a shopping area with fast food and other stores and restaurants. The room was comfortable (there were 3 of us) and met our needs for our vacation. The free hot breakfast is a nice touch, although it does get quite crowded down there and one morning we had to bring the food back to our room to eat it. The staff was very nice and the lobby and room were clean. We didn't use the pool. The only issue we had was that it did get quite loud at night on the weekend from families coming back from the day, as well as people who were in town visitng military friends.

The main highways (HWY 5 and HWY 8) were right outside the main street that the hotel was on, so getting on and off was a breeze. As for the property, wonderfully kept and in shape. No problems at all with the rooms. Being so close to the highways, I thought there may be a problem with noise, but surprisingly it was not an issue and quiet as can be. Breakfast was provided from 6-10AM and each day there was a different assortment for food. One day omelettes, one day scrambled, one day different type of omelette and of course the usual other breakfast fare (cereal, breads, sweet rolls, bagels, waffles, fruits). also an assortment of coffee and juices. Also an added touch was in the evening they gave guests as they passed the front desk a freshly baked cookie if you wanted it. Different one each day, and also they provided a choice of chips or crackers. Wonderfull to have a snack as we came back from our daily siteseeing trips. Pool and Hot tub available and warm too. We stayed on 11/19-23 and those couple days it was on the cool side, so at the end of the day it was nice to come back to a warm pool and hot tub. A nice added touch was we wanted seafood, but not a \"tourist\" seafood restaurant. We were looking for something the locals would frequent. We spoke to a nice gentleman at the front desk and asked him and he directed us to a nice local neighborhood seafood restaurant, that i must say was FANTASTIC!

Hampton Inn was a real deal! After arriving from Los Angeles and spending the whole afternoon at the Sea World, we (myself, my wife and 14YO son) would be looking forward for a fast, efficient check in and refreshing shower. And Hampton Inn San Diego Sea World provided those. The room (double queen bed) is very spacious, complete with many cable-TV channels to select. All the beds were very comfortable with thick soft pillow. The room itself is clean with simple modern atmosphere and the (thick) door also felt very secure with cardkey entry. The thick carpet also looked and felt very clean. The bathroom is also clean, not a huge one but with adequate space for you not to feel cramped. Good showers with warm water and sufficient water pressure. Towels are provided generously and smells nice too. Wifi is available in the room, free, but somehow it felt a bit slower. I don't know why, maybe because we requested for a room far away at the back of the hotel, hoping for a calm and quiet environment. We didn't bother for this since we stayed only for one night. As we have the room which is quiet as expected, I also realise that most of the area of this hotel are also quiet. So I guess (almost) all the windows and exit doors are doing their job fine in blocking the noise from outside. Parking is also non problem. At a quick glance, you may notice that it seems all the parking spaces have been occupied, but then look carefully and closely, there are always about 3 to 4 spaces available. I noticed this, because eventhough we stayed only for one night, we did go out and returned to the hotel twice. Breakfast is a real plus. Nice large breakfast room with lots of choices of breads, waffles, pancakes, muffins and cereals with fruit juices, milk, chocolates, coffee and tea. They have eggs and even my son enjoyed very much when he made his own waffles. The surroundings. A couple reviews I read before selecting this hotel, have mentioned about the nude bar located next to the hotel. My opinion, I didn't feel the uncomfortable feeling as mentioned on those review. First, the bar does not located directly next to the hotel, and somehow it does not placed itself entirely provocating. I felt that because later in the evening, we took a walk and went to Dennys for dinner (FYI, there are many choices if ones decided to go dining outside, within walking distance). There is also a pool but we didn't have the opportunity to use it, although it looks fairly inviting. So conclusion is: (+): Check-in/out staffs, clean spacious bed room, great breakfast, quiet, comforting beds. (-) : A bit slow internet, AC a bit noisy (in my room).

Luckily, we were able to check in earlier in the day (somewhere around noon, instead of the normal three o clock check in), The staff was very accomodating checking us in early and there was no problems. Our room was on the first floor (one without a deck or balcony). After check in, we headed over to Cabrillo NM and Mission Beach. Both are highly recommended and very close to the hotel. Cabrillo is beautiful and Mission Beach was fun. Except this is where we experienced the power outage while shopping in one of the beach front stores. So since the stores closed, we just walked around on the beach picking up shells and getting some sun. After an hour of noticing the power hadn't come back on we decided to head back to the hotel. Traffic was a nightmare and it took forever. Every business had closed, and everyone was in their car trying to get home. We finally made it to the hotel with some light left in the day. The staff remained very calm and had flashlights that they were using to guide guests to their rooms since no lights were on. There was still hot coffee in the lobby and they were handing out bottled water. Information they had was passed along, including info on a local restaurant that was still open and serving food. They handled a terrible situation the best anyone could have and they need to be commended for it. Hopefully another power outage of this scale will ever happen again in San Diego, but if it does I can promise that this Hampton is well prepared to endure it. The power went out about 330 in the afternoon and came on around 330 the next morning. The rest of the trip and stay was very plesant as well. The breakfast here is one of the best I've had compared to other Hilton's and Hampton's. The staff worked very hard to keep everything stocked. The waffles are great, and the hot dishes like scrambled eggs, omlets, potatoes, meats were varied each day so that nothing became boring.

They didn't even really seem busy and I was there on a weekend. Don't let this scare you away from staying here. The parking was adequate and I never had a problem. The people who can't find this hotel must be travel-challenged. It is right off the I-5/I-8 interchange ramp. There are 2 major streets (Rosecrans & Camino del Rey) paralelling this property, from either one--just take Hancock (one way) into the property and Kurtz (one way out) away from the property, no problems at all. Just pay attention to where you are going, it isn't hard. Also be aware that this isn't your typical clean bright shiny Hampton Inn. It appears to be an older hotel that was taken over by Hampton Inns. Rooms, especially the carpets and furnishings are a bit dated and worn and the interior hallways are very dimly lit in some areas. The first night I was given a terrible room location-wise. Do NOT take a room near the front or front corners of this property, the street noise is terrible all night long. Plus I was awakened by a loud train whistle many times until 2:30 AM, but the front desk claims there isn't a train nearby????? Duh, I didn't make up the train waking me up 6 times from 11 PM to 2:30 AM????? Luckily it quit after 2:30 AM. For the second night I asked to be changed and the manager was very cordial and very accommodatingly upgraded my room to one with a balcony, fridge, and microwave. This room, near the back of the property was a little better furnishings-wise than the first room, but still needed a modern makeover. The room was very large, the bed was very comfy and the TV had about 40 channels, including HBO. But this room had its problems also. Like many hotel rooms everywhere, the sink drained very slowly. The wall thermostat controlled the heating unit, but no matter how high you put the thermostat the unit blew very little heat at all and the fan at times got VERY VERY noisy. I didn't bother asking for another room, I just figured most rooms would have their problems considering the worn condition of the furnishings in the 2 rooms I had. The day I checked out I called the front desk to complain about my neighbors smoking on their balcony and how they had done that all day yesterday also. It virtually made the balcony unusable having to smell their drifting smoke smell. How can people smoke on a private attached-to-their-room balcony in a non-smoking hotel? The front desk lady said \"we can't police that, but if we smell smoke, we charge them $200 to change the drapes, etc.\" How about stopping them from smoking in a non-smoking hotel period--those are YOUR rules? The breakfast WAS typical Hampton Inn. Many choices, plus daily changes of the hot entrees. The breakfast area was large and well-stocked. The hotel seemed very busy when I was there and the area was full most times, but the overflow area always had an extra table or two. That portion of this hotel was very good. The lobby was nice and spacious, but the lobby computers were VERY slow, probably the slowest I've ever encountered in any hotel ever. Must be a very slow dial-up. Didn't use the room wifi so don't know about that speed, but the lobby computers were terribly slow. As long as you understand that this is not a typical bright shiny Hampton Inn, then you'll most likely be pleased with most things. Location and price almost balance out the property's shortcomings.

The Hampton Inn offered free parking and free breakfast. First the breakfast was very good and very surprising. Denny's is located right across the street and the breakfast at the hotel was just as good. I had two major complaints about the hotel. The first one was the parking. While it was great that it was free, the issue is because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free they don't monitor who parks in it. During our stay for four nights the hotel had a Ryder rent a truck in the parking lot. The vehicle took up four parking spots every night. After about 10pm there was no parking left. I called the front desk and they said the truck belonged to workers at the hotel and they also have rooms and needed to park there. This wouldn't have been a issue if the hotel had enough parking. About 5-10 spots were wasted every night as well due to people parking over the lines. So with the workers truck and guests not parking right about 15 spots were wasted. The other issue I had was the internet. In the room they tell you it is fast free internet. We were lucky to get 512kb. I needed to do some work while in the room but couldn't get the websites needed to load due to speed. Other than those two issues the hotel was great. The bathroom was very big.

We live in Arizona and like most of our friends, we come to San Diego every July to get out of the blistering heat. THE GOOD: It is close to the beach, Sea World, the Airport, and Old Town. It's super close to the freeway, fast food when it is late, early, or your hungry for a cheap meal, and Target, 24-hour Walgreens, Ross and Ralphs. These pretty much cover anything you forgot or didnt realize you needed. We always go buy a styrofoam ice chest and load it up with snacks and drinks for our room. We also hit the swap meet once during our stay. The free breakfast is a good savings of time and money and has a little something for everyone - and there are warm cookies at the front desk in the evening. Bonus, they have washer and dryers. These are great for getting the beach smell and sand out of things. The rooms are a nice size, the internet is still free, and we always find the staff to be friendly. THE BAD: It's is next to a Gentlemen's Club. We have never had a problem with that, but I could see it might make some people uncomfortable. The parking spots are small and the lot fills up. They now charge $25 a night for a roll-a-way. I was shocked by this. We just stayed at a 5-star resort for less money and didnt pay for a roll-a-way. My kids have always been big and now they are both young adults, we count on getting a room with 2 beds and a roll-a-way so everyone has a comfortable place to sleep without the expense of two rooms. I also miss the in-room microwave and fidge. They used to be standard in the rooms and now they are only in the deluxe rooms, but there is one down in the breakfast area. They other item I was disspointed in was the room rate. We had to change our reservation 3 days after we booked it and when we did it went up $58 a night. Not cool, not cool. (I may sound cheap but trust me, we dropped $700 at the Coach store and went to Hash House twice, all on day one!). I dont know if we will come back next year.

I did appreciate though that on Saturday night, when we came back to the hotel, because there were not empty parking spots, the manager was out trying to accomodate everybody. On the other hand, I have to say that guests were not considerate enough to park between the lines, often making it impossible for a bigger car to fit. Second, there is no refrigerator in the room. There is an ice machine on the floor, but a mini-refrigerator in every room would be a great plus for the hotel. Overall, the hotel is very nice.

Would not recommend this place if you are looking for a place with a view - but if you are seeking a good room at a good price after visiting the city and/or amusement parks - it is a nice family hotel.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cAppearances Can Be Decieving...\u201d", "Author": "DLPrincess", "ReviewID": "UR8071377", "Content": "Wow, appearances can be very decieving. Upon arriving, my family and I were impressed with the way that the Hampton Inn itself looked, but ended up being very disapointed by the end of our 4 night trip. Here, I will take a look at some of the pros and cons of staying at the Hampton Inn, San Diego (near Sea World). PROS: 1. The hotel was nicely furnished. The foyer sort of had an upscale hotel feel to it. There were lots of places to relax and a TV to watch. The rooms were decorated very nicely with dark wood headboards and had nice stonework in the showers. The comforters were these amazing pure white down comforters and they were very nice to sleep under. The hotel kitchen/breakfast area was nicely decorated and the paint on the inside and outside of the hotel as kept up. Everything looked really, really nice. 2. A complimentary breakfast was served. The hotel staff prepared brown lunch bags for \"breakfast on the go\" for hotel Guests. Inside was a muffin, apple, bottled water, breakfast bar and some other yummy goodies. The hotel also had other breakfast items available in the kitchen. There was an egg, ham and cheese dish, as well as cereal and milk. The \"breakfast on the go\" bags were served on the weekends, while the other breakfast items were served during the weekdays. 3. The staff was incredibly helpful and nice. Several staff members went out of their way to make sure that my family's needs were taken care of. Extra sheets and blankets were given quickly and there was an air of a \"can-do\" attitude from almost everyone. There is one gentleman that stood out above the rest. I cannot remember his name, but he has curly hair and it tall and was the nicest front office clerk that I've ever encountered on a hotel stay. He was very helpful--if you ever stay at the Hampton, look to him for help--he's terrific! :) 4. There are extra commodities. There is a nice pool that attracted a decent sized crowd every night. There is also a pretty nice gym near the foyer of the hotel. There is a kitchen and also plenty of places to \"lounge\" around the hotel--places to sit and read a newspaper or book. 5. Secure doors. The hotel requires that you use a key card to gain entry in and out of the hotel itself, which provides an extra measure of security. 6. Great housecleaning people. The rooms were always kept completely clean and how they keep those white comforters looking so white baffles me! :) They are really excellent at what they do! CONS: 1. Doors. The doors do not have stripping at the bottom and there is about a 1\" gap underneath each door, so lots of noise tends to come in underneath it. 2. Walls/Floors. The walls were a little thin, so you could hear conversations going on in the next room when people were talking loud. We had a family with lots of children staying in the rooms above us and you could hear them running back and forth all night on the first night that we stayed there. 3. Area. The area around the hotel is a little seedy. Once you're inside the hotel, you feel pretty safe, but outside, you feel a little vulnerable. There are some strip clubs about 1 block away (right around the corner from the Denny's) and it's lit up with big neon letters. Down the street from the hotel, the streets are not lighted very well. The gate at the back of the parking lot (around the back of the hotel) is kept open during the day until 10:00 at night. There were several times that my family went out to our cars and we saw some interesting, scruffy looking people. It made you feel like you wanted to get into your car quickly, or at least be a little more vigilent. 4. Maintenance. Perhaps the biggest inconvenience on our trip was that we had to unpack and switch rooms every single night during our stay, except for the last one. The nightmare began on the first day, when the toilet in one of our two rooms started leaking out water everywhere. Towels were put down and the front desk was called. The front desk said that the toilet could not be fixed that day because the plumber was gone. They arranged for us to have another new room. However, the new room only held one King sized bed and we had 8 people in our party. A portion of our party took the new, smaller room, while another portion, moved into the leaky toilet room and the other into the good room. (We had an elderly person traveling with us and it is easy for her to slip--the water on the floor was definitely a hazard for her). The next day, the front desk sent a plumber to fix the problem. He said that it was a minor problem with a hose and that he could fix it quickly. However, when we came back to the hotel later in the day, we discovered that the entire toilet was missing!!! There was a big hole in the ground and black stuff on the tile around it. Everytime the toilet in the next room flushed, the hole in the ground made this awful gurgling sound, threatening to spew up some concoction of toilet goo. (Thankfully, it never actually did!!) The hotel offered us yet another new hotel room and the people in the leaky toilet room moved down the hall into the new room. Thinking that our maintenance wohs were over, we breathed a sigh of relief. Only, the maintenance troubles didn't end there. On the third night, at 3:53 in the morning, both my sister and I woke up to hear a very loud and awful rattling coming from the air conditioning unit! We laughed because we found it hilarious (in a weird way), that there was a problem with every single room we'd had. I lightly hit the unit and the rattling stopped....until about an hour later when it started up again. This continued several more times, almost every hour, until I whacked it really hard and kicked it and the rattling (not the air conditioning unit) finally stopped for good. The next morning, I discovered that the shower head was also broken, roar! Needless to say, with all the switching around, the poor maintenance, damaged toilet, broken showerhead, kids running upstairs, and rattling air conditioning unit, we didn't get much sleep. I came home feeling less rested than when I'd first come to the hotel, even though I was on vacation. Our family missed out on several events and locations because we spent so much time each day, switching our items back and forth to the new hotel rooms. 5. Beds. This might just be a picky thing, but the beds were really, really soft. I have a bad back and so did another one of our travelers and it didn't do either of us any favors. If you have a bad back, this may not be the hotel for you. 6. Warm/Hot Hallways. The hallway doors leading to the pool outside were kept open during our stay, making for toasty hallways and a gigantic mosquito on the wall. OVERALL IMPRESSION: Because of the poor maintenance and the horrible lack of sleep and lost vacation time due to our room problems, I would say that I won't ever be coming back to this hotel again. My family agrees with my decision. However, if the Hampton were to up it's maintenance program and make sure that the rooms were kept in tip-top order, then I'd re-consider. Until though, we will not be returning to the Hampton by Sea World.", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHappy with the Hampton!\u201d", "Author": "roadwarrior1958", "ReviewID": "UR7303279", "Content": "Family stayed at this Hampton March 23 - March 27 2007.

Hotel is completing finishing touches on renovations. Outside does not look like typical Hampton as it is clad in yellow painted wood siding. The location is convenient but not the best area but seems typical for San Diego area. Inside areas are nice. They finished the lobby wall paper while we were there. Pool and hot tub area looked nice and heated but still did not used due to outside temps in upper 50s. Stayed in a newly renovated large King with brand new carpet (had that new carpet smell each time we went in). Room had patio, mini-fridge, microwave, nice granite counters, new popular style furniture grade vanity, new furniture, and new white bedding and pillows that all Hamptons are getting. Note that only the larger King rooms have the microwave, fridge, and patio or balcony. Housekeeping starts early in the morning and the room was always clean. Breakfast area is roomy with granite tables and counters and additional seeting just beyond in the lobby area so there was always a table to be had. Breakfast was typical Hampton and not bad for what you get- 1 hot entree each day (waffle/sausage, egg/sausage/biscuit, egg/bagel), good fresh fruit salad, whole bananas and apples, cerials, excellent coffee, yogurt, coffee cake, bagels and bread, muffins, milk, and the typical reconstituting orange/apple/cranberry juice machine. The breakfast staff always kept everything filled before running out. Hotel is very close to Old Town but I still wouldn't walk there through all the major roads in between. Other than the few restaurants in Old Town and several Mexican restaurants we found no very nice restaurants within a few miles of the hotel, mostly fast food and chains. Seems like most of the good restaurants are down in the gas lamp quarter.

It was too late to check out and the hotel's security guard delivered the replacement sheets for me to change at midnight. This Hampton Inn is currently undergoing remodeling and the rooms do not have the typical upgrades characteristic of almost all Hampton Inns. No wireless interenet (wires required), very old and beat up furnishings, no arm chair or sofa, dirty windows and a stale smell which permeated the room. Once the general manager came on duty Monday AM , I presented the situation of the sheets and he promptly apologized and offered the night on the house.
