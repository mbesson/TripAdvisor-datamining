The Shangri-La gets A LOT of hype and so I wanted to see for myself. I offer the caveat that I had high expectations. So, while little was wrong per se, it just was NOT a good value. The good: Rooms were clean and the toiletries, linens, towels and robes were of good quality. The fitness facility, steam rooms, outdoor pool, outdoor hot tub and the spa are all beautiful. Perhaps the nicest I have seen in Vancouver. The mediocre: Some of the service was great and some was poor so overall, it was mediocre. Hallway noise was audible in our first room. The standard rooms (Superior King) are very small. The decor is not impressive. Honestly, it is hard to believe that hotel was professionally decorated. Cords, are clearly visible. Curtains and wall hangings clash. Bathroom while lovely, does not compare to other hotels of that caliber. The story: So we booked a Superior King room and I was very disappointed by how small it was for the price. I was also disturbed by how loud the street noise was with the windows closed. We asked if there was room we could move to but were told the only option was an upgrade. So, we upgraded. For a small increase in price we got a much larger room on the quiet side of the building and without noisy neighbours. The check-in is located in the parking garage and is small and unimpressive. The line was long and there are only two work stations at the front desk. Slow. I also waited five minutes for an elevator. It took close to 30 minutes to get to our room. Our small and unimpressive room. We decided to grab a drink in the lounge. The lounge was nearly empty yet after far too long, I finally had to ask the bartender to send someone over. When we finally did get help, their product knowledge was not up to par although their selection was good. Predictably, room service was extremely expensive, edible but not great and the portions were tiny. Really, I could go on and on about how mediocre it was. Nothing terribly wrong (other than the small noisy room), but for the price, nothing terribly right either (other than the fitness area). Unless your primary goal is to shop on Robson street, head down to the water and stay in one of the harbour front hotels. Stay at one of the Marriott's or the Hyatt for half the price or spend the big money at the Fairmont Pacific Rim.

Well Vancouver is a great, lively, Canadian city that my g/f and I love to visit, and living in Seattle we've been there quite a few times (just check my other reviews). This time though I'm not going to say the hotel or property became a destination in itself, but boy howdy does it come close...... We were there for our annual Leafs v. Canucks hockey game at Rogers arena (3 years in a row!!!) and found online that the Shangri-la was first; running a special, and second because of this \"Experience Shangri-la\" package made it less expensive than our usuals (Sheraton, Hyatt, Le Soleil, Sutton Place), we jumped on it right away. We arrived in Vancouver late in the evening, and since I didn't want to pay for the valet $39 Canadian (because we now have our own little secret parking place in downtown), and 39 dollars is not expensive, and not any more than other properties around the city. We found short term street parking so we could check-in, and I could go park my car later. In Lost Horizon by James Hilton, Shangri-la is tucked away in the mountains of tibet. Well the entrance to the main lobby, and check-in is follows that basic concept. The entrance is not on Georgia, but tucked away on Alberni with only a small sign leading the way; Shangri-la and an arrow pointing to the right and into a winding driveway down to the lower lobby where you check-in. However my girlfriend and I entered off of Georgia, next to the burberry shoppe, you are welcomed by two fu dog statues guarding the place (how very asian). Inside of the Lobby (off of Georgia street) is the concierge desk, some seating areas, Xi-Shi lounge and two sets of lifts (elevators). No lobby in sight!!!, as I mentioned there are two sets of lifts one for the residences called \"living Shangri-la\" and another set of elevators marked hotel lifts. We took it down to the lower lobby for the front desk (this is the driveway entrance off of Georgia). The lobby is small, very elegant, and decorated in an asian motiff (like the rest of the hotel). The key card is unlike most other key cards at most hotels (you also have to use key card in the elevator to get to your floor), you don't slide the card into a stupid slot until the light turns green and remove to gain access into your room, no this is a little different. The difference is you tap a sensor on the door to gain entry into your room. We're not finished with the key card just yet. You need to insert the key card into a slot by the door to activate the lights in the room. Ohh boy!!! and when the lights do come on, you have reached Shangri-la...the paradise on earth. We were staying through a Sunday and on sundays shoppes open late, and close early and my g/f and I for the first time couldn't wait to just relax in the room!! Ok so first everything is electronic from the light switches (complete with various settings; sconce, nightlight, reading light etc.etc.) to the controls for the shades and the blinds so you don't have to get up to close either, just the touch of a button. There was also a control panel for the do not disturb so when you pressed it a pad on the outside of the room lit up in red \"do not disturb\" and would turn off the doorbell if someone rang. There were also some goodies left in the room; on the coffee table a note from the manager welcoming guests personally (whether it was handwritten or not, a very nice gesture) thank you Richard. Next to the note was a plate of fruit, and on the bed each night laid a bookmark, and a small piece of candy wrapped in plastic (each night had a different morsel of candy from salted caramel, caramel, and a grape soft chew). The bed was a queen size bed and the best part about it was that the throw pillows, and throw blanket were tucked away in the drawer under the television. The only pillows and blankets was a very warm alternative down comforter and probably the most pillow selection types ever on a hotel bed (there is even a card in the night stand with different pillow choices that you could leave out and the staff would bring those pillows). The other treasure in the other night stand was a copy of not the bible, but James Hilton's Lost Horizon (some properties offer a complementary copy, Vancouver location does not!!! I asked, its 20 dollars) the novel in which Shangri-la originated from. The television had just a great selection of channels and movie selections, but the most unique part of the television amenities was that it had a a DVD player, and ability to hook-up an Xbox, or PS2/3 for video game console playing. Another great part of the room and it seems endless but the WIFI in the rooms are FREE!!! and quite fast (BEST THING) because we both had work to do on our laptops so that is great and more hotels should offer free WIFI in the room and not be a pay thing or free in the lobby bologna. The closet had ample space with drawers, umbrellas, shoe horn, and a safe. The mini-bar was quite extensive, and they also have those stupid, wasteful, hateful nespresso single serve coffee machines (which have become popular for reasons I don't understand). To make it up they have complimentary slippers and bathrobes for use. For me the piece du resistance.....the loo, the bathroom, the john. No!!! those terms do not do it justice. The bathroom is a cathedral of cleanliness and marble. Yes white marble floors and walls. There was a private toilet room with sliding glass doors, a little shelf, and a telephone (a very private and lovely feature). The shower was large and a little confusing at first to use, because there is one lever and the way you turn either activates the wall mounted shower head or the hand held shower head. The bathtub was large and deep great for soaking in a warm bath (downside no bath bubbles or bath gel), I still soaked in the tub many many times. The blinds are even controlled by switch on the wall. Next to the sink I had noticed a remote control and thought to myself what could this be?? I hit the power button and on came the mini-television in the mirror, let me repeat that a mini television built into the bathroom wall mirror, I kid you not. L'occitane is the supplier of their bath gels, soaps, shampoos and conditioners (great stuff), they also have two toothbrushes with mini-toothpaste supplied in the bathroom. Overall, a pretty sweet bathroom err....cathedral. We didn't use the pool, or the hot tub or the fitness centre, but the pool is on the 5th or 6th floor (i don't remember) I checked it out and it is heated so even on chilly days its nice to go swimming. They have a world class spa called, Chi which we didn't use, 24 hour room service (very nice) but didn't use. They have a company car for guests to reserve and get chauffeured in (i think a mercedes S-class) but didn't use. So all the world class service and amenities of a 1st rate hotel.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cShangri La Vancouver\u201d", "Author": "reviews255057", "ReviewID": "UR125054508", "Content": "What a beautiful hotel.

This was our first time in Vancouver, so I'm going to mention distances and timelines in this for those who are like us - not sure exactly where things are located and how to get there. First, the entrance IS tough to find - it is on Alberni and NOT on Georgia - just look for the small sign that points to go down into what looks like a parking garage. We were greeted by a bellhop and a staff member who immediately checked us in - and upgraded us to an executive suite (incredible!). The room was amazing - king bed with a pull-out sofa - very roomy even with the sofabed out - and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking downtown. Everything push-button and very high-tech, so the kids loved it. The only issue we had was that while we were unpacking, they sent up a tray of different kids of homemade cookies and fruit as a greeting with a hand-written note from the manager (thank you, Richard, very nice touch). After being assured by the staff person that the cookies did not have nuts in them as so many people are allergic these days (our kids are severely allergic), our kids dove at the cookies. My husband noticed one of the cookies looked like peanut butter and tasted it (and it seemed like peanuts). Grabbing our kids and having them spit out anything they had in their mouths (thank goodness the one they chose was chocolate chip), we called the service and they checked - turned out that although they normally NEVER put nuts in the cookies, today of all days they added peanut butter cookies to the tray. The apologized profusely and asked if we could wait 20 minutes and they would send us an entirely fresh-baked tray - which arrived exactly 20 minutes later with more fruit and more apologies from the staff, who were appalled that that had happened. We write this not to be critical of the hotel, but of how well they handled what was a pretty scary situation for our kids. The concierge (Jeffrey - he was fabulous!) gave us a great map, a handout (Kids Guide?) of all the kids activities around vancouver, and got us reservations at Al Porto, an incredible Italian restaurant in the Gastown district. A quick 20 minute walk (with lots of stops by the waterfront) and down a cobble-stone alley, we were at Al Porto - seated immediately (think busy Italian restaurant with cosy ambiance). Service was outstanding (the salad with walnut-encrusted goat cheese, gnocchi, fettucini alfredo and beef tenderloin were great, but the BEST was the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms in tarragon and garlic - highly recommend it)! A bonus about this hotel is that there is a great market called Urban Fare that is right behind the hotel - made for a great place to get fruit, amazing croissants and coffee every morning. The cheese section is incredible, as well! Also, Robson street is truly 1 block away - this hotel is in an excellent location! Day 2, we decided to go to the aquarium - while it is a 30 min walk (for an adult), 2 kids and rain seemed to make the decision to do a cab easier. The concierge again was great - called us a cab and gave us discount vouchers for entrance. Aquarium was great - beluga show and dolphin show were close in location and distance so we could do both. We were pleasantly surprised to find that they have snakes and a whole amazon section, as well, so note that it is not just aquatic life! We lunched at The Market (at the hotel) - the market burger with brie and truffle sauce was outstanding. Grabbed coffee again at Urban Fare and walked Robson Street, then back to the hotel to swim. NOTE - the pool is outside, but \"heated\" - considering it was about 4 celsius, we decided to opt for the hot tub, which was a great temperature for the kids. I will say, I think the part of this hotel that has trumped all else for the kids is being able to watch 'Ice Age' on the TV in the mirror in the bathroom while showering after the hot tub. Our kids have determined that they are never leaving this hotel :) As a comment about what we read about having to call for ice - yes, you do. But the longest it ever took for ice to arrive for us was 2 minutes. We honestly can't enough about this hotel - the amenities, location and most of all - the STAFF - are absolutely incredible.

We had a few niggles, but nothing severe enough to drop this review to a 4. Service was outstanding.

The room was genuinely a luxury experience - a step above similar accommodation we have had in Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton properties in the US. The mis-steps were as follows: The hotel had arranged a driver from YVR, who duly met our flight as arranged, but had managed to lose his car keys. Fortunately he was still able to get into and start the car, but any amusement faded when we stopped not once but twice so he could tie down the trunk with his belt. This added significantly to our journey time, not ideal coming in at midnight from Las Vegas. Market at Jean-Georges was hit and miss, or to be more precise as breakfast was included in our rate: miss-hit-miss-miss (the fifth day we had a dawn train to Seattle; the hotel kindly provided pastries and fruit (which was then confiscated by Customs at the station)). As I think someone else pointed out, a lot depends on your server - maybe we were just unlucky 75% of the time. However, we experienced similar service issues at several restaurants; maybe it's a Vancouver thing. My final gripe is being charged $12 for an espresso by the pool. It was from a automatic machine and not even any good. Overall, however, an experience I would recommend, and would probably stay here again if in Vancouver.

The lobby is split into 2 floors, lower lobby for reception & transportation, the upper lobby on street level for concierge & meet-n-greet.

No doubt celebs stay here, but you get the sense that the Shangri-La is all about discretion and focusing on nothing but an excellent guest experience.

I had originally paid for a superior room with twin beds and without breakfast on the hotel website, but they were nice enough to change it to the Winter Wonderland package upon request. This included breakfast ($60 credit/day for 2 pax). The cost was CD$347/night inclusive of taxes. The location of the hotel is perfect. Right in downtown Vancouver with Robson street, the main shopping area, just behind the hotel. However, the layout is unusual as the main reception is one floor below ground level. Tell your taxi driver to enter the underground carpark which is where you will find the entrance to the reception. This is great for people who want privacy. The doorman was efficient in opening the car door and getting our bags. The reception area was small and thus gave the feeling of a private check-in for guests. The receptionist was very welcoming, friendly and ushered us to the lift. The hotel is the tallest building in British Columbia and occupies the first 15 floors. Our room was located on the 14th floor. The room was of adequate size for a Superior room. The interior design was zen-like with chinese paintings on the walls. There was a hand written card from the manager welcoming us to the hotel which I thought was nice. We had a great view of the city surrounded by office buildings. The flat screen TV was the largest I had seen in any hotel room. You could control the intensity of the room lighting (instead of just on/off) but I found the room to be very dim; great for those who want to get some sleep! You could draw and open the blinds and curtains with the touch of a switch. The beds were exceptionally comfortable. The minibar was adequate with a nespresso coffee machine. They also provided welcome fruits (only on the first night), complimentary daily newspapers and free mineral water bottles during turn down service. The bathroom was almost all marble and was beautifully designed with the usual L\u2019occitane bath products. The TV in the mirror was certainly a pleasant surprise! However, I felt that the bathroom was quite small (maybe because it was a superior room). There is complimentary internet in the room. Alternatively you could use the business centre with internet, fax and printing services. The Concierge is located on the street level which is where the hotel\u2019s main lobby is located. This place felt more like the entrance to a private luxurious living room with a warm fireplace, large chandeliers and plush sofas. It didn\u2019t look like your usual hotel lobby and you would never find large group of tourists hanging around. You really have to get acquainted with which entrances lead to the hotel lobby as we walked into the residential entrance and had to walk through a \u201cmaze\u201d before we found the lifts to the hotel rooms. The main lobby entrance was very understated with 2 chinese lion statues at the revolving door. There was no doorman to welcome you. They really should have more staff in this area to attend to the guests as I felt that the Concierge was always busy. Before I arrived at the hotel, the Concierge was extremely helpful in providing information on day tours and booking transportation to Whistler. Communication was done efficiently via email. During my stay, the Concierge was helpful in pointing out the local sights and recommending dining options. They even had the restaurant menus! However, I felt that they could have taken it to the next level and have been more personal rather than just telling me information which I could google from the Internet if I had time. We had breakfast at the Market restaurant everyday. The service was great and one of the waitresses (she seemed like eastern european) was exceptionally friendly and talked to us about the weather and places of interest in Vancouver. The food was good, not exceptional. Don\u2019t order the chinese breakfast. I didn\u2019t like the french toast as it seemed as if the toast was deep fried and too sweet for my liking. The banana pancakes were great! What I didn\u2019t like. The layout of the hotel is unusual as tour buses cannot stop anywhere along the hotel to pick you up. We had to wait for our Whistler coach at the Hyatt hotel which was a 10-15 minute walk away. When we asked the hotel how we could get there, they suggested walking there. I\u2019m sure they could have considered the fact that we could have many pieces of luggage and dragging it all the way to the Hyatt in the horrible Vancouver rain wasn\u2019t such a good idea. It would have been nice if they offered hotel transport but we took a cab anyway. The hotel was certainly splendid like any other Shangri-La should be, but it lacked the hospitality, sincerity and personal touch which I have experienced at other Shangri-La hotels. They don\u2019t really value their guests here. I had to call room service 4 times (over a span of 2 days) before I could get two pairs of bathroom slippers and the mineral water that I asked for never came. This is absolutely unacceptable especially when the person on the other line tells you \u201cwe will get it for you straight away\u201d. I also question what benefits a Golden Circle member could enjoy at the hotel as I could see none being a member myself. So why bother having such a membership programme in the first place?

The spa was tranquil with subdued lighting and the treatment room I saw was an oasis of calm with private shower and huge tub, fluffy robe and slippers. It was relaxing just to visit. The outside all year pool looked very inviting. The decor throuout the hotel was elegant and calm. lots of wood , a water wall, asian inspired hangings and a total feeling of quality.

Our good friend Jeffrey Victor happens to be one f the concierges at the Hotel (although he was not working the night we stayed) and arranged to have a fabulous corner suite (the view rooms were all sold out by the time I booked) with a nice bottle of wine and fruit basket awaiting our arrival. It was one of those 550+/- SF units with a bar area and living room, and office with a flat screen TV (in both rooms) and even a TV in the bathroom MIRROR!!??!! The marble bathroom might have one questioning if there was any marble left in the world?! Flood to ceiling and heated floors! We didn't want to leave the room but I promised my wife some shopping on Robson before New Years dinner so off we went. When we came back, we just relaxed, watched some TV and enjoyed our bottle of wine until our late seating (9:30) at The Market restaurant down below. The restaurant was below our expectations due to the poor service. There were far too many people for such an intimate 6 course set-menu that we weren't eating our main until closer to midnight. However, the food was INCREDIBLE! My wife was not feeling like eating at that hour and was pretty full so we ended up taking our food back down to the room to eat the next day. All of our drinks were comped (all 6 of our 11.00 Martinis) for the inconvenience. It was hard to be angry as we didnt have far to go after dinner to get back to our room and the food was amazing after all. The next morning, I hit their state-of-the-art fitness facility for a workout (Damn, that was hard!) and enjoyed a delicious protein shake from their smoothie bar afterward. I went downstairs and next door to the Urban Fair market and grabbed us some delicious breakfast items to bring back to the room and called down for a late check-out (until 1PM).

Originally I was booked to a Superior room, but I was upgraded to the Deluxe room. When we entered the room we found a fruit bowl and some nice chocolate-chip cookies waiting for us along with the handwritten note from the hotel's General Manager welcoming us and wishing us a nice stay. I thought it was a very nice personal touch. Room itself was spacious, had a nice \"office\" area and I loved the nice, clean bathroom. The toiletries were good and beds were very comfortable. The only drawback was the fact that the coffee machine in our room did not work, however, we had a great selection of teas and that made up for it. Service: The front desk staff and the manager on duty were exceptional. As I mentioned earlier, there was an issue with the reservation, and basically the property did not have a room for us on the first night. The manager on duty handled it with the outmost class and kindness. I must say that I was really impressed by her people's skills. We were offered a room in another hotel along with the breakfast (which was included in our stay in Shangri-La) and transportation. When we returned to Shangri-La the next day, both valet and the front desk staff greeted us by our names and the manager herself checked us in and showed us to our room. One of the concierges was very nice and helpful. We were lost on our day of arrival, since we could not see the entrance into hotel (it is under ground), and the concierge came out with me to show me where to enter the garage. Another concierge was not nearly as nice and certainly had an attitude and very cool and standoffish demeanor. Not sure why he was acting like that, but it was so apparent, that even my sister, who does not speak a word of English, asked me after i spoke with the concierge if he was not very pleasant, or helpful. It was that apparent even from the body language and his facial expression. Location: Location of the hotel is superb, close to all major attractions and to the Vancouver Tram bus. Lots of great restaurants are within walking distance, lots of shopping is close by. Restaurant: We ate breakfast at the Market, and were not impressed at all. Service was very impersonal and extremely slow. As a matter of fact, several tables that were seated after us, were served before even though we did ordered the same food as everyone else. Considering that we had a child at our table, it would have been nice to get at least her order a bit sooner. Overall Impression: I picked Shangri-La over other comparable hotels because I had a great stay in Shangri-La Sydney. While Vancouver property is not quite on the same level as the Sydney one, I must say that I still truly liked this hotel and enjoyed my visit. I think the genuine kindness and professionalism of the hotel manager and the front desk staff certainly made up for any other shortcomings that we experienced. Room was great (see pictures) and location was excellent. I would certainly recommend this hotel if you are considering a visit to Vancouver.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cA Perfect Hotel for a Perfect City\u201d", "Author": "febryle", "ReviewID": "UR84974399", "Content": "What a delightful and beautiful hotel!

I made several inquiries to the Concierge desk before our arrival regarding airport arrival, transportation from the airport and restaurant suggestions.

Our experience at the Shangri La did not disappoint. Other reviewers have commented extensively on the hotel amenties. While our room was just a superior room (I think this is the lowest category) and it was somewhat small, it was beautifully furnished and maintained. Although our room was on George Street, traffic noise was not an issue. Knowing that the hotel is not a water view hotel, we actually had a nice small view of a nearby boat harbor.The bathroom was of generous size and comfort and beautifully appointed. When we requested an additional sitting chair (the room had only one) It was brought almost immediately. A request for all decaf pods for the expresso machine, done. Thoughtful handwritten notes left by management and staff. Lovely. The hotel is beautifully decorated thru out, the spa in particular. The gift shop is quite small and should be expanded. They have a limited amount of Shanghai Tang items (too bad), but if you like the fragrance in the hotel, you can purchase it there. The location is ideal for walking to various sites. One day we took one of the free (tips appreciated) walking tours of Vancouver neighborhoods (Two guys Vancouver) Great! Very informative. The Urban Market next door is great for any food items you might like. We had dinner at Market one evening; the food was delicious, the service superb.

Little deatures like the Nespresson coffee machine are good, but it is undone by there being no millk to make coffee. That was fairly typical of this hotel. Finding the entrance, if you are arriving by car, is a challenge as it is on a different street to the hotel's address. Once you're there, you check in in the basement. We arrived at 3pm and had to wait 45 minutes for our room, which was unacceptable. Room service was expensive and of a very average quality, but the room itself was pleasant. The bathroom was large and whilst there was an in-built TV in the bathroom mirror, it was tiny and you couldn't see it from the bath. Again, fairly typical of this hotel - a good idea poorly executed. We also had issues with the TV in the room in that we couldn't turn the TV off. Two hotel engineers later and after being told by both engineers and the concierge to try pressing the off button on the remote, they eventually figured out that the remote control in the room didn't match the TV! An hour or lost sleep later and it was finally resolved, but by then, we had a pair of sleep-deprived kids. Location is good - 2 blocks to the main shopping area. It's a long walk to Stanley Park though. Overall, not a great experience for a hotel charging these prices and we would seek to stay in one of Vancouver's many other 5 star hotels next time before staying in the Shangri-La again.

The hotel itself is the tallest building in Vancouver, and very architecturally striking. The lobby is classy, and check-in was efficient and professional. Our room was large, furnished asian-style decor, with dark woods, and soft lighting. The bathroom was a great size, not ridiculously huge, but comfortable; all marble, with a separate enclosure for the toilet, and a TV in the bathroom for news while getting ready or having a bath or shower. The bath products were from L'Occitane, and were a very nice touch. All the amenities were provided. The bed was insanely comfortable, very soft, and they offered a choice of pillows, and a nicely weighted duvet. There was also a 42\" flat screen Sony TV and ipod dock, which was a nice touch. At night when we came back to the room, we found our room had been prepared for sleeping, and had a hand-written note and a plate of fresh fruit and bottled water provided for the evening. We spent the latter part of the evening at the outdoor pool and hot tub - and had the entire area to ourselves. The pool is quite small, so not suitable for many people and not a great destination for kids), but it had nice lighting and fountains, and the hot tub was nice. I noticed the pool area had a lot of tiling missing, and was dirty in some places around the pool edges. Cabanas were also provided for daytime relaxing. Being in a hot tub on the rooftop in downtown Vancouver is a nice way to spend an evening. Our hotel stay included a $76 ($38/person) breakfast credit in the hotel's restaurant (Market by Jean-Georges). Breakfast was exquisite. I'd heard many great reviews of the French toast, and it did not disappoint! perfectly cooked. My girlfriend had eggs benedict and granola with yogurt, both presented and prepared perfectly. Fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice not to be missed! Service in the restaurant was exceptional, as was the decor and atmosphere.

Everything in the bathroom felt and looked like white marble from the border around the tub to the tile on the floor. The bed was unbelievable, so comfortable that it made the Hilton and Marriott hotel bed feel like a Motel 6 bed. In general, the whole room was elegant with wood that looked like mahogany. As a single woman, I felt very secure because you have to have a room card to activate the elevator, your room control, and other facilities throughout the hotel. I loved the technology, just push a button and the drapes would open, lights dim to reading, evening, or night, even \"do not disturb\" under your room number lights up at the push of a button. At most hotels, you can hear everyone in the next room. I didn't hear anyone in the neighboring rooms. Very quiet and nice large room, equal in size to any hotel suite room. This hotel was awesome, and I would suggest it to anybody that wanted to stay in a nice hotel while visiting Vancouver. It's in a excellent location in downtown Vancouver. It's close to the pier for cruise ships visitors, like myself, Robson St., Stanley Park, Amtrak, and restaurants galore. I paid a little over $300 a night on Expedia and got an awesome room at the Shangri-La with an incredible view and breakfast. The service at breakfast was excellent. They had fresh squeezed orange juice! I had the pancakes with real Canadian maple syrup, bacon, and fresh fruit. My favorite special touch was that in my room each day was a complimentary bottle of Whistler water, and a fresh fruit plate (banana, apple, and plum) that had a very special note, with my name hand written on it, that welcomed me to my room, and the Shangri-La. I've stayed at a lot of hotels including the Waldorf Astoria in Orlando, and Royal Hawaiian in Honolulu, and this hotel was more awesome than any hotel that I've ever been blessed to encounter. My only regret is that I couldn't stay longer at the Shangri-La, I even begged for a late check out time, but it wasn't available because another guest was waiting on my room. The business center was even elelgant with big screen Sony computer, with free internet, and 5 print pages. The lady that helped me in the business center was great, and very nice. Even the people that greeted me at the door, and parked my car, bent over backwards to help me find locations in Vancouver. There were people needing to get by me in the parking garage, and the doormen stayed calm, and nicely gave me directions to the Amtrak, and post office. One of the doormen, even programmed my GPS! I guarantee that if you stay at the Shangri-La hotel, you will be pleasantly pleased and impressed with this hotel, and customer service. Every staff member seemed very concern about me having a good time and constantly asked me if I needed anything to enhance my visit. Shangri-La thanks for a wonderful visit in downtown Vancouver.

The, location, in downtown is very good and close to Robson Street and not far from many places to visit in Vancouver. There is a Supermarket next door (Urban Fare) that is a good place to buy things or have an inexpensive meal. Second, the hotel is quite new, so most of the fittings are good and especially the Nespresso coffee machine in the room. Third, service mind is very good except in Market restaurant as it will depends on who is your server. Then, the not so good things. If you get a suite room, (as we were upgraded) then the A/C may not cool your bedroom properly, so it could be quite warm at the beginning of the night, so it will be better to stay in small room, so the temperature will be more consistent. I also must say that if you have balcony it may come with a poor view (as the hotel is in the lower floors of the building is not worth it to get a balcony). The servicing of the room was never done in the morning, but in the afternoon both days we stay there. Even they claim that they were doing turndown service in the evening this was not true, except the first and they just service the room once a day the second and third day. Then, the breakfast at Market restaurant was not good as already mentioned by other people as first, service was very slow. One day we have to wait for table 10 minutes and then 10 more minutes to ask for our order, then when requested the American breakfast (they called the Deluxe breakfast, quite a joke !!!), 2 eggs any style does not let you have an omelette and they said we have to pay 4 C$ extra. When we complain they said they will not charge us, but this was clearly very low class from such property that claims to offer excellent service. Besides that the staff was rude when we complain about the omelette surcharge and later on ther rest of the service was very bad and even though they waive the charges of that breakfast we decided not to come back the following day, even though they told us they will waive again. The TV selection is very poor, not a decent movie channel as they just offer movies on sale (very bad again) and not even a music channel. I can even get better TV sleection in a Comfort Inn or Best Western Inn. Having stayed in many other Shangri-la properties before, this experience was by far the most disappointing and it seems that the excellent standards they have in Asia cannot be kept in their property in Vancouver, so at the end of the day is not worth it to pay their room rates to get such lousy service when having your breakfast.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "trinidad and tobago", "Title": "\u201cIt's the Shangri-La with a Vancouver twist\u201d", "Author": "rtybc", "ReviewID": "UR74107692", "Content": "Unlike the sprawling common spaces you expect to see in an Asian hotel the shangri la Vancouver is simple minimalistic but with all the right elements to say.

Sadly this is definitely one for the trade descriptions act, as you quickly find out when you wonder on down to the reception to check if you have been given the wrong room, that this is an enclosed balcony (strangely not detailed as such in their website). By enclosed balancy they mean a part of the room which is partitioned by sliding doors and has a small opening in the window. Definitely a feature not to waste your money on. The rest of the room is great and the staff friendly and helpful (except when its comes to balconies). Several reviews on commented on the reception and lobby being a little strange.

Marble from top to bottom, fluffy luxurious towels and robes, walk in shower, bathtub, TV in the bathroom mirror and L'Occitane toiletries. Restaurant: Marketplace is a beautiful modern fine dining experience. Expect nothing but the best in terms of food, wine and service. Many of the dishes have an Asian twist, but the cuisine is more European in my opinion. Pool and Spa: Whilst the spa looked great, I did not have a treatment. The pool was OK, but looks out on a very unattractive car park. The hot tub is the same. The fitness suite is as you would expect. Car Parking: Full valet service is excellent Service: Nothing is too much to ask, they really have brought the service found in Asian hotels right in to North America. Staff are friendly, gracious and impeccably dressed. Don't be intimidated by the formality of it, its really they type of service they are striving for.

All in all this made it an affordable stay in a city with many very expensive hotels--all of which charge for the extras. Don't forget that Vancouver taxes add almost another 18%. The hotel was top flight with great linens, fancy marble bathroom--the TV built into the bathroom mirror was a bit over the top, but neat--slippers robes and a safe that fits laptops. Called room service for a bucket of ice and I swear they appeared in less than five minutes. The staff was helpful, friendly and remembered my name. The decor and influance is asian--you will be handed your keys with both hands try to remember to accept them with two hands as well. Parking is underground and comes in from the rear of the hotel. Not a big deal although I've seen reviews that complained about it. It's the tallest building downtown and distinctive looking so it is easy to find when walking around or driving into the city. We were in the smallest of their rooms on the 15th floor and didn't have much of a view due to the other high rise buildings--the other side of the building offers balconies and larger rooms--if you want a view make sure you inquire or make a request. I would have killed for an upgrade! Try the bar menu for an evening snack good burgers--we were there for the Stanley Cup playoffs and it was an interesting, multicultural, handsome and classy/casual crowd--they were serving buttered popcorn which sinfully rich. Eggs Benedict were great at breakfast and they had some really outstanding breakfast sausages (read not Jimmy Dean). Summary, if traveling on the expense account don't think twice-- just book it!

The Shangri La hotel in Vancouver, in our experience, well deserves the rating of 5 stars. The friendliness and professionalism of the staff is very impressive. The quality, cleanliness and comfort of the rooms were admirable, with the furnishings and style of d\u00e9cor being of the highest quality and also very soothing. Also, the Chinese breakfast we had in the restaurant was absolutely delicious and very well presented.

I believe this is the gold standard for hotels in Vancouver for me, and I have stayed at most of the 4 stars at least once. I chose the Shangri-la as my new company hotel after some very disappointing stays at the Opus and the Fairmont. I have no regrets. I use the Shangri-la for business and leisure travel alike. A couple girlfriend getaways, entertaining family when they stayed in town at the same time I did, and to host clients when I needed a great meal and an elegant atmosphere to entertain in. All expectations exceeded, every time! Beginning with the speedy and very personal check-in service by one of their staff, butler style, you can quickly sort out your paperwork in the room and then commence to enjoying the amenities that the hotel lays before you: a welcome basket with fresh fruit and some wine and chocolate (part of the Golden Circle Amenities Program) a truly gigantic bathtub, a Magic Mirror TV (as my husband refers to them) in the large bathroom, exceptional toiletries, all the nice extra touches like toothbrush, razor and shaving cream, nail file, laundry powder, sea salts for your bath... all organized for your use. A large shower and a private toilet make this one of the nicest hotel bathrooms I have seen in a long time. Move to the bedroom and the well sized rooms have one-touch window coverings and lights all manged through a panel next to the bed. The sheets are perfectly soft and luxurious, and the bed is extraordinarily comfortable. I have been known to be a few minutes late for an event while I reluctantly ended a nap to go get ready. The gentle glow of the clock that lights up when touched is just another example of the un-intrusive comfort the rooms presents. Turn down service is always discreetly finished and ready for my restful night by the time I return from dinner or a cocktail. If I am using a meeting space, like the private screening room that can be rented for my company events, I am always pleased that the service extends to their banquet and catering staff. Lovely rooms. I would LOVE to attend a wedding here. It would be truly elegant! The Nespresso machine that I cant live without at home is also happily part of the rooms features, and I usually fix myself a quick shot of Cafe Roma while I get my luggage put away. My only wish here is that cold cream would be ready in the room for me. I usually stop by the Market next to the hotel to grab a small carton for my stay. Connectivity for your laptop is a snap, and everything you may need is a phone call away, and the staff always answers your call as if you were the most important guest in the hotel and your needs are met quickly and efficiently. When, and if, you leave the room, stop by the grand lobby lounge for a delicious \"Pacific Rim\" beverage prepared by Nadia or Shane, who will make your time there enjoyable and delicious. Stay and listen to the wonderful piano player in the lobby lounge transport you back in time to the swanky days of elegant entertaining. Work out in the private yoga room, the large and well appointed fitness room, or enjoy the locker rooms steam room to unwind solo. Lounge by the pool and enjoy the sun if there is any, or wander down to Jean Georges and enjoy the sexy vibe, for business or to unwind with your friends. Its a respectable mix between sleek and unpretentious. But more importantly the food is succulent and satisfying and treated with great care. Room service was always prompt and perfectly prepared. Any minor issue is fixed immediately, no questions asked. More cream? No problem, there in three minutes. I have had the formal tea in the afternoons as well, and it was a charming and unique way to entertain a client, she and I both had a wonderful time with it. I have spent a couple afternoons at the spa, Chi, and truly enjoyed the service and the fact that I actually felt relaxed when I left and went directly to my amazing room where I napped sufficiently until it was time to take the prompt car service to my next event. Join the Golden Circle club and enjoy extra ammenities and rapid check out. Or, as Shangri-La Vancouver inspired me to do, travel to one of their other hotels in Asia and you will find that the service extends across the oceans for a reason. This hotel group has truly defined their service standard and as a business or personal travel stay, they have made each one special and memorable. If you were to be visiting Vancouver for the upcoming Olympics, for an important business meeting, or as a special getaway, Shangri-La would be the best location for your stay. Enjoy it, for even 24 hours here can feel like a wonderful vacation. Thank you to the staff of this exemplary hotel! Go, stay, relax, luxuriate, enjoy... and return again and again!

I decided that I am a Shangri La \"groupie.\" The central location of the hotel makes it easy to visit most of the sites of Vancouver. From the moment one enters the Shangri La Hotel, the atmosphere is one of serenity, incorporating a relaxing ambiance due in no small part to the scent throughout. I found the underlining feeling of the hotel to be contemporary and comfortable while not being overly trendy. The lobby is welcoming and the separation of the lower lobby from the upper lobby turned a potential problem into an asset, separating vehicular traffic from pedestrian traffic. The rooms are not identical in shape which is a plus. Every client has different requirements.Some like spacious rooms while others prefer large bathrooms and closets. Thus, a room can be assigned accordingly. The lighting in the bedroom was tactfully done and the bathroom lighting was bright enough so one can see. The bathtub has a back support and the additional amenities, (bath salts and lufa, special beds and bedding, pillow menu, the clock that lights up when touched and does not glare at you in the dark) make one realize that a lot of thought went into making the rooms extremely efficient, as well as comfortable . The wonderful balconies afford a spectacular view of the city. CHI is the ideal place to relax and unwind after a busy day, with different treatments to fit varied needs and time constraints of hotel guests. John George restaurant serves exceptional meals from breakfast to a wonderful dinner. The French toast offered on the breakfast menu is exceptionally good, as was everything we sampled for dinner. The formal tea was also an experience, with sandwiches, scones with clotted cream and sweets, not to mention the beautiful china on which it is served.
