The keys arrived down a chute at the front door as I was talking into a kind of speakerphone. Bizarre. A keypad lets you in the front door, but I didn't have the code, so I had to get the voice on the speakerphone back to give it out to me. But...what you'll get inside is a perfectly comfortable two star hotel. The room I got bore no relation to the one in the pictures on trip advisor, but it was clean and the shower worked well and that's all you need for 80 euros. At breakfast, I finally met some human beings, and very nice they were. Plus, they had the usual continental spread of meats, cheeses, cereals, pastries and breads on offer. You'd need nothing more. At this level and at this price, I'd come again. I slept well, and as I've said, the food was perfectly okay, and the price you can't grumble about. Yes, it is sterile and boring and plain and featureless...but it's not one of those places that makes your heart sink. It's not luxurious and it's not trying to be.
