Second night, I was moved to another room - one they thought was more suited to my reservation - not. I was working 12 hrs a day from the start and really didn't need this additional headache. I finally discussed this matter with the actual Manager (after having to schedule an appt after hours)on the third night since i didn't usually didn't get back to the hotel till late. I was then \"promised\" a fridge \"soon\", they brought me a micro right away the next day, said they would fix the a/c, re-check the toilet that never seemed to flush right, and a different mattress that didn't sag in the middle. In the days before I moved out, the toilet still flushed the same despite numerous reports it had been fixed - the a/c unit was finally replaced after 8 days (not during the day, but that night after I got back to the room). The fridge was still a no show as was the mattress. When they saw me carry all my luggage through the lobby at 5am, they acted surprised I was checking out. The only adjustment to my weekly rate was about 10 USD. On a good note - the staff will gladly help/listen to you with any problems you have - promise everything will be taken care of tomorrow - just as soon as they get done texting, chatting, or conversing - you will get full attention. When my cell charger mysteriously went missing from the room (just a day before I checked out), they gladly offered me a box from the back room full of chargers from the past 10 years - I was told to take what/how many I wanted. Unfortunately, no one had lost a charger recently that matched mine... The in-house restaurant food was excellent - albeit, menu somewhat limited, with only one cook, and one waiter that doubled as the cooks helper, wait times were sometimes lengthy. In short - this is not a \"resort Hotel\" - I knew that - but I could tell a lot of others did not. I really cannot recommend for any stay longer than a week.

I went there with my husband for a mini vacation 5 days/ 4 nights for a great deal $240 (tax included) which I booked to have a nice time visiting the island and some point of interest that I always heard as a kid but never got the chance to visit... I cant complain of this hotel. It was nice, very clean, and confy... The employees were very polite, accomodating and helpful.. But it is only good if you are on a business trip, if you are visting relatives, going to a wedding or just for visiting the island like I was ... but if you are expecting luxury and being pampered this is not your place... Amenities: It has 2 jacuzzis (1 hot, 1 cold), a pool (that was very warm when I went in to have fun with my husband), the hotel was empty so that was a plus... we had it for ourselves... they are open only until 10pm, they were clean, free of mold or other floating things and that was good too... they also have a pool bar but it was closed my whole stay... They have nice landscaping, a little garden near the pool, umbrellas with chairs, wifi, a restaurant, a gym (I cant tell what was in it because my key never opened the door to it and I had to be with a security guard so I just quit trying to get in)... they have a game room with couple of old games...and a salon... I think thats it... Surroundings: The parking lot was spacious, it is near supermarkets, airports, schools, post office... they give you maps to travel around... I took my GPS, I got lost with their maps... but the intention is what it counts... Service: All the employees were very nice, friendly and polite. The manager gave us a 50% off card to play golf at Costa Caribe Golf Course as soon as she saw us talking about golf and saw our clubs... that was very nice, they were paying attention to every detail... there was one time I needed a plate and a spoon to eat something in my room and they were able to get it for me and I wasnt eating from the restaurant, and other time I needed a glass of milk and they got me one quickly without asking... Housekeeping: They cleaned the room every day, they left us plenty of soap, coffee (yey!!!) and towels (Tip: take your own towels, the ones from the hotel are very small)... Maintenance They were remodeling the rooms, they were cleaning all the time, the halls were clean, some smell like cigarrett but it came from the rooms... so if you dont like that smell you will have to work with it because there is a section of the rooms in the hotel where you can smoke in them. Other than that everything was fine. Restaurant: I cant comment in regards to the food or the restaurant because I never went there to eat. I can say that they were very polite and helped me when I needed from them but thats it. I went to eat out of the hotel, I ate a full breakfast (2 egs, jam and cheese, bread toasts, juice or coffee for $2.99)... lunch for $6.95 and dinner for the same... you can go to the town and find a lot of places cheaper than the hotel restaurant... Opportunities: 1. They dont have elevators, so if your room is on the 2nd floor make sure you use the cart to carry your stuff near the steps to your room... 2. They dont have a bellboy to take care of your luggage when you arrive so prepare to take care of that yourself... 3. Your room key might give you problems so try to get a room with the new lock. 4. Cable suck big time, after being on the road the whole day, we went to the pool to relax and then went to our room to plan our next day while watching TV, but my god my TV reception was horrible and barely watchable... I think that I was able to watch like 3 or 5 channels... I didnt bother to call front desk because eventually I was so exhausted that I fell asleep... but that was something that I didnt like... 5. Bigger towels. 6. To maintain the pool opened after 10pm, and open the pool bar during the day or night, have music and drinks at the pool... Other than that, I dont believe there's something else that I found wrong... Overall Experience It was a great deal which I wasnt able to reject, I had a great time and I just used the hotel to sleep, and that was fine for the price I paid...
