All the people working at the front desk were nice and accommodating, and the night bartenders were friendly and helpful as well. The rooms are large and the bathroom is well set up with the vanity separate from the bath/toilet. We found the location just too far away from the action to be convenient. After our first trip on the bus/metro (for us was quite confusing...) we found it would just be much easier to rent a scooter so that we could do things on our own schedule. The breakfast was delicious with tons of options, which is a good thing, because you will want to eat it-- otherwise you will be starving by the time you get to Rome's center. Overall the only thing we disliked, other than the location, was that getting WiFi is ridiculously expensive at the hotel and there was no inexpensive options in the immediate area that we could find.

I went the Tourist information center at the airport and purchased a Roma Pass there. If you plan on visiting many museums and using the bus/Metro system, I highly recommend getting a Roma Pass. At the airport there's a bus that takes to you Rome's city center (right near the Termini Station) for 4 or 6 euros (i can't remember but it's the cheapest way to get into the center). It's a good hotel in the E.U.R. district of Rome (however, it is pretty far from city center where all the cites were). You can take the B line to Laurentina (it's the last stop on the train). It's about a 25 minute ride from Termini stop. When you get out of the train and walk up the stairs, stay to your left. Exit thru the doors that are on your left. As you walk thru the doors, there are rows of bus spots on your left. Bus #776 will take you to the hotel. I think bus #776 is parked in slot #1. The ride on the bus is about 10-15 min. (one passenger told me that it's 6 stops away, but sometimes the bus driver doesn't stop at every stop so either ask the driver or keep your eyes on the road)! As the bus goes down the road, the hotel is on the left hand side. At night time, there are blue neon lights saying \"Hotel\" to help you spot it easily. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I had no problems checking in at 1:30 in the afternoon. My room was sparse, but large. My room was like the size of a little apartment in NYC. There was a living room, and when you open another door, it leads into the bedroom with twin beds. My living room had doors that opened into a little outdoors patio. It was really nice. The beds are comfortable. It was clean, and the showers had great water pressure. The bathroom was pretty large as well. Very nice hotel in Rome. There was also free breakfast in the morning (basic continental breakfast)! It's pretty close to Ostia Antica if you plan on visiting the site!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, Ile-de-France, France", "Title": "\u201cVery bad service at the front desk and the telephone\u201d", "Author": "Kary726", "ReviewID": "UR120236110", "Content": "My family try to call me and like for 20 minutes nobody answer the phone, and finally when someone answer the phone, she was extremely unpolite and she never apologyse, she just said \"what u need\", so finally i just ask her the room number; then and the front desk we asked her about the roma pass and she said \" i 'm sorry i don't have time now but there was noone else at the front desk.

Unlike some other places we stayed at, which were apartments made into small hotel, this place was an actual hotel. We found the internet to be quite expensive (you could only get the 20-Euro-for-10-hours package). On a more positive side, the staff person downstairs was friendly and allowed us to use her computer free of charge for several minutes so that we can do a check-in for our flight! (how nice is that??) The room was clean and spacious; in fact, it was two rooms: a 'living room' and a 'bedroom'. The down side was the location of the hotel. In order to get there, you have to go to Laurentina station and then take the 776 bus (which was a little tricky as you don't really know where to get off and have to ask people on the bus). The hotel is pretty much in the middle of nowhere, so if you want to go out in the evening to eat, your only options are a small pizzeria or the hotel restaurant (we ended up choosing the hotel restaurant, which we found to be good). Also, to get to any city attractions, you would have to take the bus and then the metro. The reason we chose this location in the first place is that we naively thought it would be easier to get to the airport from there than from Termini station, for example (since it is closer on the map). We were wrong: we actually had to take the bus back to Piramide metro station and then a train to the airport (while from Termini there is a direct train). Overall, except for the location and the price of the internet, we were quite happy with the hotel.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, VA", "Title": "\u201cEur Suite Hotel\u201d", "Author": "flojoflojo1", "ReviewID": "UR118582392", "Content": "Good hotel in the E.U.R. district of Rome.

It was smoke-free and even had a balcony. The staff was really accomodating. The only downsides were that you can't control the temperature and they add a $18 Euro fee per person even though my trip was prepaid. $18 Euro is nearly double that US plus whatever my credit card charges so I wasn't happy about that. The location was pretty far away but fortunately, the train station is just a bus away. Don't walk to the nearby restaurants, they aren't that great. Catch the bus towards the train station and there are some cool places along the way. The kebab place and Gelatto were my favorites.

It is in a lower income area of Rome, but we were never uncomfortable. The staff was very helpful and always had someone there who was fluent in English. The rooms were the best part. Very large and spacious. All had a large living area in addition to the bedroom and bath. Air conditioning was good...sometimes you just had to ask the desk to turn it on. It was cool a day or two while we were there and they opened the windows and turned off the A/C. A refrigerator, safe, and blow dryer in each room. The buffet breakfast was acceptable, but couldn't describe it as delicious. It was exactly the same every morning. We did have dinner at the hotel one evening and it was fine, just not something to rave about. 15 euro each included water and dessert. The bus stop is just around the corner from the entrance of the hotel. Bus 776 takes you to the Laurentina metro stop which is the last stop on the line. From there it's very easy to get wherever you want to go in Rome. A week's metro pass cost 16 euro and covered the bus, metro, train, and tram. It does take 30 to 40 minutes to get to the tourist areas, including waiting on the bus. We never waited over 20 minutes for the bus. One day we were short on time to catch a tour and we took 2 taxis (5 in each taxi) .

Take bus 669 to the subway station. Its the last stop so it will than take you 20-25 minutes to get to the Termini where you can switch to the other subway that has the stops at the touristic neigbourhoods. The hotel is located in a dead boring residential area where you have to walk at least 10 minutes to get to a shop or restaurant. The poorly maintened hotel does not have ANY emergency lighting as we experienced during a 24 hour power breakdown! Its situated at a very quiet location. No disturbing sounds at night. The very practically furnished hotelrooms come with a lovely bathroom, and provide enough space. Theres a big fridge, but no watercooker or coffeemachine. Breakfast is so horrible that I haven't eaten during the week I was staying. There wasn't even boiling water! The airco is very effective but you cannot control it yourself so you have to ask the front desk to set the desired temperature for you. Staff was unfriendly and does not provide ANY tourist information. The information that I did get from them appeared to be inaccurate. I noticed during my stay that the hotel is very popular with Chinese tourists. The lobby and other areas like the breakfast room are very unsociable and is reminiscent of an Eastern Bloc country.
