We got to our rooms...very small for the price, and mine was, of course, next to the monorail...Hell, I was so tired....down we go to an eating area off the lobby for some nourishment.....waited an hour for soup and a club.. the waiter was very cordial and said he was sorry for the wait...yeah me too..staggered back to our rooms for some sleep...in the a.m. got back to the airport for a wonderful and reasonable breakfast. it was easier going back to the terminal..just followed the crowd.. I feel this is certainly a buisness persons hotel, as we were almost the only ones with luggage..all others were rushing to and fro with just brief cases...and for sure on expense accounts...next year I will certainly leave the terminal...wait for the shuttle..and get a more comfortable stay a couple of miles down the road.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Earth", "Title": "\u201cOur Stopover Hotel\u201d", "Author": "NorwichCityFC", "ReviewID": "UR126557995", "Content": "We always travel via Air Canada and use their Stopover Program when traveling through YYZ.

The rooms are nice being clean and very comfortable. Cannot stand hotel pillows and this hotel is no different. Would rather use the telephone book but that's another story. The only concern I have for this hotel is the elevators. They are on the smallish side and I would suggest trying to get a room on the upper floors because if you are leaving early and you are on the lower floors, it might take a few before you can get on. We have used room service, the lounge and the dining room and have been satisfied with each. It is pricey but we have had no complaints. For those who don't want to pay the prices, it's a quick trip to T3 for some decent choices. We have always found this hotel to be relatively quiet during our stays, however stay away from the rooms next to the elevators. The constant hum of the lifts is deadly.

The hotel IS clean. The rooms are large and spacious. The bed is very comfortable and you have a large work desk for the business traveller.

The windows don't open, so you couldn't even get any fresh air to get the smell out. The light fixture on one side of the bed was ripped out of the wall and missing.

There was poor sound proofing in the hotel - I could hear every toilet flush all night and people talking in the hallway and in the other room. Did not get a good rest at all. I would stay here again only if I'm forced to lay-over at the airport due to flights but would not choose this hotel otherwise unless they do a reno.

The first stay I arrived from Australia at 10:30pm - smooth check-in, standard king room on 7th floor - left early the next morning. A week later my husband and I checked in around 6pm on a pre-paid rate - well here the issues started - first of all the front desk agent could not find my booking and asked for a print-out. I did not have one (as I made the booking when I did not have access to a printer) - fortunately I had one on my laptop - he was quite unfriendly about the whole thing but finally got us checked in. We were assigned a room on the 4th floor which had a whole host of issues - there was a broken ironing board blocking the entrance to the room just inside the door, the alarm clock was on the floor, and the mini-bar was empty and turned off, there was no bottled water, and no bathroom amenities. I went back to the front deck and spoke to the same agent - his attitude was \"oh really, the system indicated the room was ready\". He asked if we wanted a new room but since I had already opened my suitcase etc - I said no - can we just get some bottled water and by the way why don't you give us access to the Club Lounge - which he did however we never got the water. Now onto the Club Lounge - since it was now about 6:30pm we went to the lounge to have a drink (you pay full bar prices for these) and the free canapes which were quite nice. When we ordered a drink - a beer and a glass of wine - the server / lounge attendant told us they only had 1 bottle of Stella, some Corona and some Bud and one type of wine. So we ordered the Stella and a glass of wine - well the Stella turned out to be Light (which had already been opened so we did not return it even though this is not what my husband wanted) and my glass of wine was served in a beer glass because \"they had no wine glasses\". These 2 drinks cost $25 + tip. The continental breakfast the following morning was quite good. Of course, we chose this hotel for the convenience of being attached directly to the terminal; however, we were flying into and out of T1 so it's not quite as convenient as when using T3. You need to take the train from T3 to T1 and walk quite a distance to the check-in area. A further gripe is why should internet access be $17 per day ?? it's free throughout the entire Toronto airport. But one tip - if you're on the 7th floor you can actually access the free WiFi provided in the Club Lounge on the 8th floor. I will be contacting Sheraton directly to find out why my online pre-paid reservation made while logged on to my SPG account went missing - very strange indeed.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cSuper Convenient\u201d", "Author": "Scoobabums", "ReviewID": "UR123444613", "Content": "This was our first time staying at this hotel both before and after our trip and we will most certainly come back.

We stayed in a standard room on the 7th floor, could not hear any outside noise, though people in the next room were banging around at 4am, but this is fairly typical of any airport hotel I have found, as people commonly leave early in the morning, focused on their departure and not considerate of others sleeping in. The room was typical Sheraton, clean, pleasantly decorated, functional, and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were extremely friendly and efficient.

I sat down at the desk table and pulled the chair closer and a nail on the bottom frame protruding out I scratched my finger as very sharp. I told the desk clerk as we went to the bar/eating area.Chair removed. Another chair could have been brought back to our room for our convenience but was not! Quite busy in the bar and I had to go get a waiter as thought we had been waiting too long(10min)or not seen sitting down. This area also serves the same menu as their dining room. We attended the dining room, no one at their front desk but we could see a man in a area where they place their food menu talking to another waiter. We stood at the desk for a few minutes then I walked to the man and asked if we could sit down. He said yes anywhere and kept on talking. We did sit down. The dining room atmosphere I think could be up dated and improved. Lights very high, leather seats sink down to far, wood around table was sticky as varnish coming off, and top stained as one can tell where the table mat's have been for a long while and table top look dirty but only because finish needs up dating. Food came in good time but I would suggest two waiters in the evening dinner hour as we had to wait for water service as one very busy. This was at the Dec stay near evening and dinner time . On our Jan 20012 visit, the room we stayed in was much better in quality. Ate in the dinning restaurant again and my food cold and waiter split a jog of water right behind my wife. If you order any alcohol drinks with a meal for two our bill well over $100.s surprized.! Conclusion. Excellent location. We felt food meal was just average for amount and quality. This hotel is on the high scale price for sure. Decor average and should be up dated. The front clerk (Jan) should of been aware of our Star Wood preferred guest Membership as we told her.

I asked for an upper level floor with a king size bed over looking the runway. My request was granted with a smile. Front desk staff were quick and friendly. Our room was great, no issues, very clean and comfortable. there were a few issues that keep me from giving this a five star. The first being that you have to pay $2.00 for calls even if they are local or if you are using a calling card as well as a rate/minute! The restaurant is extremely over priced. My next issue is the real problem. I threw my back out the day before and was in extreme pain. I called and explained this to guest services and asked if I could stay in the room until 3pm as it would be very unconfortable for me to wait around in the airport. he explained that the policy was that I could stay until 2pm but anything after that was a $50.00 charge. I understand they have to draw the line somewhere but it was only an extra hour and in the interest of customer service I don't think it was too much to ask. The other issue was lack of communication with staff. The maid started knocking on the door at 8:30am and did this 2 more times until my husband had to tell her we weren't leaving until 2pm. At least she knocked. the guy who refills the water just swiped his card at 11:50 am and walked right in without knocking. Thankfully my husband was in the room as I was still undressed in bed!!

Being this close to the airfield, you'd expect a lot more noise, however the hotel is very quiet, and the triple-pane windows do prevent a lot of noise from entering the room. The only downsides to this hotel are the following: 1) Parking Cost - NOT a direct cost that goes to the hotel, as the Airport Authority controls the parking. However, it really is annoying to have to pay for parking. 2) The restaurant is very pricy -- this is to be expected in an airport hotel, however. 3) ANY hotel that charges for internet today is crazy.

I was greeted by an amazing employee which i had spoke with previously on the phone.... she was amazing both on the phone and in person and made me feel immediately at ease. The feeling continued throughout my stay. I am from the states and frequent Toronto (never alone) and the level of comfort given to me by the staff stayed with me for the entirety of my trip. I was initially just going to stay one night( although i had booked 2 nights) and forfeit the money for the second night, but the ease and solace that I felt in this hotel had me spend the extra night. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and noise-free. If you dont look out of the window, you dont even realize that you are like literally right in the airport. I did dine in the restaurant downstairs and the service was once again impeccable. Very comfortable for the solo traveler. The central location is definitely a draw. I had no difficulty whatsoever traveling to any of my meetings (or excursions :) The free internet in the lobby was a great touch. I really did feel at home in this hotel. Now for the cons( which really I had none until leaving the hotel) I checked out sunday morning at around 5:45. There was no staff at the desk. I had to go behind the desks and peek into the back office to get someone. Now allow me to backtrack , because im from the states and the roaming costs are insane, I was initially going to try and purchase a prepaid phone. I decided to just purchase a calling card from the gift shop and use the hotel phone. I figured that local calls should be either free or of minimal cost. I did hear something about them being 2.00 after that and figured that the local calls would be 2 dollars per call. fine. I chose the local number to call on from the phone and sat and made my calls. Well... to my surprise, upon checking out i had racked up over 100 dollars worth of a phone bill! In 2 days! For this I may as well have just roamed on my US phone or purchased a local phone. One last thing.... was the parking. I checked in on a Friday in the afternoon.... I left the hotel friday night and when i was leaving my ticket didnt work so the parking attendant called up to the hotel to make sure that my ticket was in fact validated. The attendant didnt give me back my ticket( because it wasnt working) when i came back in I had to take another ticket. To make a long story short I ended up having to pay for an additional day of parking that I didnt use because of the ticket malfunction.

It was always a relief to not have to wait for a hotel bus after a long flight or a red-eye (an overnight flight). I have stayed at this hotel frequently between 2006-2011. The only thing I ever liked about this hotel was the proximity to the airport, the bed, the orange-scented shampoos and the Starbuck's coffee. The front desk staff has all the warmth and friendliness of rattlesnakes. Staff was usually extremely rude, indifferent and somewhat nasty at the front desk, and often ignored me when I arrived (even when they weren't serving other guests, they'd stand there, perfectly aware of my presence, taking their time at their computer). There were several occasions where my sleep was disrupted by housekeeping staff yelling back and forth to each other in the hall (sometimes I had flown through the night and couldn't sleep on the plane), and false fire alarms that went off when I was sleeping in preparation for a long work day I had the following day. Calls to the switchboard were always an agony, as it usually took them forever to answer (I used to work for a Sheraton hotel on the east coast and another Starwood hotel when I was younger, and they drilled it into our heads that no guest should have to wait for more than 4 rings when calling the switchboard - at this location, I called the hotel switchboard and hung up after 18 rings). When I would finally get ahold of the switchboard, the operator was usually rude and almost confrontational if there was a problem (and I was always polite and apologetic, because I used to work in the hotel industry and know what it's like, so I take painstaking care not to be a pain in the butt to staff). More often than not, they put off checking us in, so I consistently had to call down to the switchboard, wait 10+ rings for them to answer, and then ask to be checked in so my phone would be activated. I was assigned a room with a broken toilet after an exceptionally long work day, and I called down and asked for a room change (I was exhausted). They said they were full and would send up maintenance, and it took maintenance almost 30 minutes to come to my room, and in the end, as I sat on the bed waiting for another 30 minutes, he couldn't fix it - so I got my room change over an hour after I had asked for one. I don't appreciate being lied to (being told it's full when other rooms are available), especially when I'm exhausted and all I want to do is sleep without the sound of a toilet freaking out in the bathroom next to me. Restaurant staff was usually nicer than the front desk staff, especially the morning staff, and I have always had a good experience with them. The evening wait staff seemed less friendly and rather abrupt, and getting food service from the afternoon bar staff was always slow an frustrating. And by the way - a glass of beer here costs about $8-$12. Why? Because they can. It's absolutely ridiculous. I believe I have had one experience with bed bugs there - on the fourth floor. I didn't see the bugs, but my ankles were covered with about 6 or 7 red bites when I woke up the following morning. I'm not 100% certain this was a bed bug experience, though I've been bitten by them in other hotels before and the red bumps around my ankles looked identical. In the 5 years I stayed at this hotel, I have only had the one alleged bed bug experience in the summer of 2009, and when I told the manager about this, she didn't seem surprised and waived my in-room internet fee of $15 (another ridiculous money-grab). I've had no subsequent occurrences of bites after that one time, and it is my hope that, if those bites were bed bugs, they dealt with it quickly. I think of everyone I've ever talked to in this hotel (besides the morning wait staff at the restaurant), she's the only nice person I've ever encountered. I forget her name, but she worked in the evening I believe. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't have to stay here. I'd recommend it if you're leaving on an early flight out of Pearson International Airport, as you won't have to deal with hotel airport bus schedules and the like. The proximity to the airport is a definite convenience, the beds are very comfortable, and surprisingly, runway noise isn't too bad considering how close it is to the airport - they did a good job with soundproofing, I'll give them that. However, if you're looking for value for your dollar and top notch service, you won't get it here (food is expensive, alcohol is ridiculously expensive - just go to the Swiss Chalet in the airport, at least it's fast). If you're expecting a warm welcome and a smile, you will be disappointed. Staff seems to have a chip on its shoulder, and were bitter and sometimes downright hostile during many of my frequent stays. I always went out of my way to be nice to them when I checked in, and it was a rare occurrence indeed when I would get a return smile. I've since quit my corporate job to start my own business, and I don't miss having to stay at this hotel at all. If you just want to sleep and get on a flight, then the beds are wonderful and the soundproofing from airport noise is well done (as long as a fire alarm doesn't go off or housekeeping staff isn't shrieking at each other in the hallways). Otherwise, don't waste your money. Their rates aren't cheap, and for what you pay a night for a room, the LEAST you should get is a smile from staff.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "67022", "Title": "\u201cConvenient and Clean\u201d", "Author": "67022", "ReviewID": "UR115823008", "Content": "We stayed here overnight, on a trip home from Ottawa.

Flavia advised that there was no repair or sewing service, but then said she would reattach the button herself. She took my jacket attached the button and returned it to me in the restaurant in a few minutes. What an excellent example of how to treat clients. I am a demanding client with high expectations, which, Flavia more than met. She was efficient, helpful, and friendly. True professionalism is rare, so I feel it is incumbent on me to acknowledge Flavia for the excellent service she provided. Flavia represents the Sheraton Gateway Hotel very well.

In October when I started to look for hotels near the Toronto airport I looked first at a couple of favourite properties. However we would have had to take two rooms due to the situation, None of the properties I favoured would allow a cot in the room. When I phoned the Sheraton Gateway I talked to the manager Sham, giving him the details of our needs. We negotiated the use of one of thier family rooms which had a pull out sofa for the third bed we needed. This was a double bonus since the Sheraton Gateway is right at the airport and connected to the terminals and the off property parking garage by an elevated train known as the Link train. We would be able to park for a reasonable price and leave coats and winter gear in the car since we were flying to Florida for a holiday. On arrival we were quickly checked-in and in our very spacious room. It was great. The one downside was the pool. It was at this point out of service for needed mtce so was unavailable for the \"kids\" to use. The hotel provided a very nice town car to transfer them to the near-by Sheraton Four Points ( one of my favourites in this area ). This worked out very well. In addition there was a generous price adjustment for the inconvenience. The bed was very comfortable with NO airport noise. Nice flat screen TV with a great selection of channels. In the morning it was an easy get-up and onto the LINK train for the 2 min ride to Terminal One for our flight. Did not have to go outside at all, very convenient. An excelent experience with the booking through Sham, great stay. I have one gripe with all of the 5 star hotels including this one. They cannot seem to provide a complimentary breakfast nor complementary internet. In this case they wanted $10 for an hour of internet. Other 5 stars we have stayed with are the same. The Sheratons have a club level which includes these things but at an extra cost to what normally is a higher price anyway. I recommend this hotel and would quickly stay again for the location and convenience.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing service\u201d", "Author": "firoan11", "ReviewID": "UR91012733", "Content": "I stayed at the sheraton gateway and I had such amazing service with a customer service representative named SAIRA so polite so helpful so energetic and full of life.

I had flown from Cuba to Toronto and was connecting to Edmonton the next afternoon. I landed in Toronto at around midnight and was through customs, received my baggage and in my room by 1 AM. The rooms are a little small. Especially, when I had three people in it with me. I expected there to be a couch in the room for one of us to crash on. Instead, they have an easy chair with an ottoman. It was a good thing my sister is relatively short, so she curled up on it and was fine. The bed was comfortable and quite clean. Didn't see a single bed bug which is a concern now in Toronto. Now two negatives with the hotel. For being a hotel that has triple thick windows to keep out the aircraft noise, they certainly didn't do it with the walls between the rooms. Unfortunately, the neighbors on the wall with the bed were quite amourous and I could hear every noise through the walls. The second problem was I had ordered a pizza and the front desk would not let the pizza guy come up. I had to go down to the lobby and pick it up there. Very strange as the elevators do not have a card swipe to get up to guest rooms. I would definitely stay there again, if I needed to be at the airport. They have a airline check-in terminal in the lobby. So I checked in and printed my boarding pass right there. It is connected to Terminal 3 and the LINK Train runs between there and Terminal 1.

It is located in Terminal 3 and could not be more perfectfly located. We have always had a good experience at this property. When we needed a hotel on September 30th before our trip to Florida, it was an obvious choice. I booked this hotel months ago through the SPG web-site. After a lengthy discussion witt my wife, we decided to indulge on this stay and upgrade to the Club Floor using extra SPG points. 3,000 I believe. When I booked the room, I specifically requested an airport view because my two young children love looking out at the airplanes. I followed up my e-booking by calling the hotel directly in August. When we arrived at 4:30pm on September 30th, we checked in. We were given our room keys and sent to the 7th Floor. We arrived only to discover this was in fact not the Club Floor. We immediately returned to the front desk and I was told that the Club Floor was sold out, so we were placed on the 7th Floor instead. When I booked the room on SPG.com, they offered a club room and I cashed in my points for a club room. Why would the hotel sell more Club Rooms than they have available? Only after I complained did the gentleman at the front desk offer to add access to the Club Lounge to our room key. I was completely shocked, I redeemed my SPG points for a Club Room but they could not provide me with a Club Room! We did take advantage of the Club Lounge following this disappointing check-in and I must say this property has really cut back over the past year. The snacks provided in the lounge were fruit, cheese and crackers. In the past, this property has always offered a much better selection. We decided to leave and go out for dinner. This stay really upset my wife and I. We have discussed it since our vacation and the only conclusion that we can come to is that when we arrived to check-in with two young children in tow the front desk staff discriminated against us because of the children and would not honour our reservation. When we did stop at the Club Lounge, there were no other children. It would appear to me that they don't want kids on this floor for whatever reason. When we checked out the following morning, I made an inquiry about receiving back a credit for the SPG points that were redeemed for a Club Room and was told no. How could they not refund our 3,000 points when they failed to deliver a Club Room.

This hotel is in a great location (that was why we stayed there). However, it is dated, it is dirty, the staff are unhappy and unhelpful and the prices are way too high for what you get. The room has updated furniture - looks good in pictures but once you get there the room itself is showing signs of being run down and the entire hotel looks like they should start again. (not just some new furniture). The bathroom was the same - the toilet was chipped, the bathtub looked filthy, the carpet had stains (and really - this is a Sheraton - why would stains be okay?). The hallways to the rooms are dark, narrow and depressing. The restaurant was way overpriced for what you got and very slow service that night. We asked for extra towels/sheets and had to call 3 times with excuses made each time and when someone did finally turn up (over two hours after we called) they made sure we knew that they were not happy that we had dragged them out. All the staff did not seem to want to be there. If you are like us and want the location to make a flight then yes you will survive for one night but if you have a choice find somewhere else to stay. There wasn't one huge problem but just a lot of little things that added up to a bad experience. It was not a room or a hotel that I wanted to linger in like many others. Also, here is my big pet peeve with some Sheraton hotels - some have this odd practice of leaving 6-12 inches of the bottom of the mattress uncovered by the bottom sheet. Fine if you are a short person and your feet don't make it down to the bottom of the bed but us taller folk do not appreciate this. We understand that this must reflect some issue with the sheets - that they become undone on the top and people complain so you put more sheet to the top so it can be tucked in well but it results in a space on the bottom of the mattress? We did not appreciate this - if there is a problem get better sheets. Or perhaps staff just find it is easier to do this? Also, this hotel had the sheet, then the duvet (without a duvet cover on it). This seems to be a North American thing. If you are going to use a duvet on the bed THEN do it right: put a proper duvet cover on it that gets taken OFF EVERY TIME NEW GUESTS ARRIVE, washed and a new one put back on. I know this takes extra time - but again, we stayed in many places in Europe and none of them (even the little family run hotels) had a problem with that - even with King duvets. Then you don't end up sleeping with a dirty uncovered duvet - most of us move in our sleep and there is no way that one sheet is going to stay in place between person and duvet. This is just a poor practice. Check out the German Airport Sheraton's and the comparison is like night and day.

The best part about the hotel is the location. You literally walk across the bridge and you're at the hotel. The view from the room was pretty cool, if you like looking at aircraft (which I do). It's basically the view from a control tower overlooking the runways. Unfortunately, not all was good at this hotel. I made the mistake of eating at the hotel bar/restaurant, and almost fell out of my chain when I saw the prices. Unfortunately it was late by the time I got in, and I didn't have a vehicle, so I wasn't in the mood to go out searching for food. In hindsight, I should have walked over to the airport to get a bite. For a simple chicken dish (that wasn't that good) and a beer, the meal was $60.00! For that price I could have enjoyed a filet from the Keg. Also, while at the gateway, I went to use the gym. I walked in to find a space no bigger than a closet, with a rack of free weights and a couple machines... definitely not a good space. There were two people in the room and I couldn't work out because we were bumping into each other. I enjoy getting a workout in when I travel, so I was definitely disappointed.

The room was spacious and in great condition. As expected, the food is pretty over priced in the bar and restaurant but I've seen worse and it was pretty good.

I asked at check-in if my key would work for the Club Lounge (I am SPG Gold) and was rudely told no - platinums and those booking a room on that level only. Rules vary from hotel-to-hotel so no big deal but the attitude from the gentleman who snapped the answer back at me made me feel very unappreciated, even as a Gold member (who will be qualifying at a Platinum this calendar year). Upon check-in I was notified that the in-and-out for the parking garage was not working properly and I would have to return to the front desk each time to get my new ticket swapped for my old one - a pain but not a big deal. The issue developed each and every time (about 5-6 during a 3-day stay) I went to the desk to do this and the attitude I got from the staff including one woman who tried to explain to me how to enter my ticket into the machine talking to me like I was a child. I explained to her that I was told by the woman who checked me in that this is what had to be done since the ticket reader wasn't working (I did try once to make sure it wasn't fixed, it wasn't) and then she tried telling me the entire activity of swapping tickets was unnecessary. Again, I reminded her that I was told by her fellow co-worker this is how it had to be done and IF I tried using my old ticket (the one that was on file and paid for) that it wouldn't let me out since I hadn't used it to get back in, she finally understood and swapped it out but with a completely unnecessary attitude.

My accommodations were booked on the Sheraton SPG Club Floor, where the wired and wireless internet (in the club lounge) is free, and you get free bottled water as well as Hors D'oeuvres during the business week in the lounge. The rooms are pretty much identical to the rest of the hotel, except you are on the top floor, and you are well taken care of. My stay this time was notably different, in a positive light. At check-in, my request from my booking to have an airfield/airport view was already taken care of, as well my keys and breakfast vouchers for the restaurant (to which Club Floor accommodations come with on the weekends) were already prepared. Past stays have had me asking for the breakfast vouchers, which just added an extra step. This was a nice touch, as it eliminated me having to ask the Front Desk staff for help a second time. After getting up to the 8th floor, I noticed a selection of the days papers were laid out in the hallway on a nice dark wood table, so that customers could just pick up their paper at their leisure. This also was something new, and I found this to be particularly thoughtful. The rest of my stay was very comfortable. One thing I have come to like about the Sheraton Gateway is just how helpful their staff is, and how friendly they are. the Housekeeping staff is always smiling and saying hello to me in the hall. One final touch that really impressed me was a Waiter in the restaurant. The gentleman's name was Angel. To my surprise, Angel remembered me from a visit a few months prior, and even remembered my order, right down to the incredients in my breakfast omelet! This is absolutely an amazing feat, considering the number of people they serve in the restaurant! To sum it up, this hotel is very convenient as a stay-over for business as well as a nice place to stay for a pre-trip snooze. I have stayed at this property for over 10 stays now, and have yet to be disappointed once. The only negatives (to be fair), to this property are: - the expensive over-night parking charges (28.00$ I believe, but you are allowed in and out access) - The restaurant and room service appear to be very costly - Not much in the area with regards to alternative food / entertainment, unless you have a car and can travel just a short distance from the airport. PS -- If you are staying on the Club Floor, don't forget to check out the Club Lounge in the late evening..

The snacks in the lounge and the change in the room service hours- I think we all recognize that the economy has affected every business. The hotel business is no different. I'm sure that when the economy improves you will see the hotel adjust their services accordingly. I don't think you can complain when the food in the lounge is provided free to those on the club level - there are cheese and crackers, roasted vegetables and fresh, fruit, sweets, good coffee, tea, water. I think that is plenty. In my experience, this hotel is incredible. It is so convenient if you are flying out of Pearson; you just walk over to Terminal 3 or take the monorail right outside the doors of the hotel over to Terminal 1. You don't even have to go outside. The staff at this hotel will do everything in their power to make you feel welcome, give you personal service and take care of your needs - EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. They never hesitate to take a suggestion, immediately take care of any concern and always with a cheerful disposition. The managers are also friendly, helpful and considerate of their guests.

It was definitely convenient, we never had to go outside to get back and forth to the airport proper (it's connected via tunnel to Terminal 3), but tha was probably the best part about our stay. I was hoping that since the parking was at the airport, that I would be parking my car in one of the covered parking garages (since we were flying in December, and I didn't want to come back to find my car covered in snow). Unfortunately, the hotel parking is at the very top of the parking structure, leaving your car open to the elements. This wasn't a big deal though, since it would've been the same at most other hotels. One of the other reasons we decided to stay here was to get a view of the runway and the planes taking off and landing. We did have a 'runway' view room, but all you really see is the taxi area, with the landing strip off in the distance, and at night, you can't even see that. Overall, the hotel itself wasn't bad, it was up to Sheraton's usual standards (although most other Starwood brand hotels I've been to don't charge for printing in the business lounge), but for (significantly) less money, you can stay at the Westin Bristol Place a few blocks away, which I think is generally a nicer hotel, and you can actually see the planes in the air.

The rooms themselves a nice, even a touch more elegant than some typical Sheraton rooms that I have stayed in in the past. Beds are equipped with the comfortable Sheraton Sleeper Bed and the bathrooms all come with the new-ish Bliss shampoo and conditioner. All the rooms are decorated in classic mahogany and brown tones and most come with a mini-bar. One thing to be cautious of is being put in a room that faces the automated train that connects the terminals - it can be noisy. Another great highlight of this hotel is the 24 hour swimming pool. You rarely find a pool open all day and night, so take advantage of the quiet if you can. The fitness centre is also nicely equipped (and well air conditioned) for a workout if you'd like. There are also separate mens and ladies saunas and steamrooms in each respective changing area. In terms of food, the bar and restaurant can serve each others menu - just ask for the other if you only get one. Food is incredibly expensive, almost disappointingly so however some items are worth it. If you do eat here you can expect good service, well nice presentation of the food and tasty dishes. If, however, you can't stomach spending $20 on a hamburger - walk across the skybridge into the terminal for more reasonable prices.

There is also, I believe, free wireless in the lobby but a charge for internet in your room. There is also a business centre on the lower lobby if you have printing/faxing etc needs.

Check in was very easy and the lady at the front desk really went out of her way with my 2 young children. She invited them around the desk to help her and have them extra room cards to look at. She offered a runway view if we wanted but they only had 1 king bed so that wouldn't work for 2 adults & 2 kids. We stayed with our original booking of 2 doubles. I would have preferred 2 queens though. Still good I think for $100. Parking I think was $28 a day or $4 per 1/2 hour as the hotel doesn't own the lot. Didn't matter to us as we had returned our rental car anyway. The room was spacious, clean and the beds were very very comfy. Nice toiletries. The coffee is Starbucks but not that great. Again fabulous service. We received a courtesy call from guest service to make sure all was well. Flat screen tv, leather club chair, desk. Tasteful. Quiet!!!! Never heard any noise at all!!! We ate dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. We were sat at the back because we had kids I'd imagine. The kids menu was good (about $6 and included dessert). They had crayons too. The adult choices were limited and pricey. My chicken dish was a large enough portion but $35. Steak was $40. They did have a summer special of fish & chips for $18 I think. Room service was pricey as well but I did like that breakfast can be pre-ordered for delivery starting at 5:00 - 5:15 am. Great for early risers. We were able to check into Air Canada from a kiosk in the lobby the night before our flight. Great. Couldn't print luggage tags until morning. Not so great. They have a very easy and quick tram from terminal 3 to terminal 1. We never waited more than 3 minutes. Good thing as Air Canada was a long tedious pain but that's another story.

My complain though is that we upgraded to the \"Platinum\" frequent program because the original room given by the staff at the front desk did not have a great view of the terminal. It was facing a massive air conditioned unit. The only rooms available with a better view, were those on floor 8. The room did not look any different than the other ones in floor 5, I was a little disappointed about that. I guess I was expecting something a little better, not that there was anything wrong with it, but still I wanted to feel pampered with the upgraded we had just pay. We kept wondering what kind of amenities does this Platinum program comes with?? We went to the lounge area, which is only accessible with your room key(part of the platinum program). But all we found was used coffee cups with food flies, and cold coffee. The cappuccino machine did not work. This place seemed abandoned and depressing. I guess to make the story short, the only amenities we were able to obtained was a free breakfast, which it was just o.k. served at the Mahogany grill restaurant located at the hotel. This restaurant by the way is outrageously expensive! we expend $150 for a simple steak and a trout dinner the night we arrived, and half full martinis glasses! my god, we go to the CN tower and we eat like kings for less money!

They must have used it all up by the time they goty around to building the walls between rooms (and from the halls). Unfortunately, our neighbouring guests (4-5 inebriated NYE celebrants) were quite boisterous (I considered it unreasonable to carry on in an airport hotel beyond 1am even if it was NYE). The walls were so thin that we could definitely pick out specific details of their often heated conversations. We complained first to the front desk and when that failed to do anything we spoke with the manager to shut them up. By this point (2am) it would have been too much effort to be moved to another room but it seemed to eventually settle down.

We decided we would go over to the airport to get some breakfast, but on the way I stopped at the SPG gold desk to confirm breakfast wasn't included and they told me that it was indeed included. She sent us off to have breakfast while she went to find us some vouchers. It was one of the best breakfasts I ever had. Freshly squeezed orange juice, fresh pineapple and strawberries, bacon, eggs, hash browns, cereal, croissants...delicious! Also, on the day we checked in to the hotel, my wife hurt her back when she was lifting a bag and it was quite bad in the morning. She was not looking forward to a 4 hour flight in pain. We spoke to the lady at the SPA in the hotel and she arranged for a registered massage therapist to come in and give a massage before our flight left!

I thought it would be nice not to have to get a hotel shuttle or hire car, but just to wander over the footbridge and be in our hotel room, as we arrived at Terminal 3. We also figured that the airport monorail that goes past the hotel would be a great treat for our 6 year old son. And everything was as we wanted it to be. Check in was painless. We asked for a room overlooking the monorail, and the first one on the 4th floor was just a bit too near! We opened the curtains and were eyeball to eyeball with the people on the monorail station platform, who kept waving to us! Also the room was a bit dark as the station blocked out the light. We asked to go up a floor (ie 5th) and further along from the station, and this was great - nice view down onto the monorail and over to the airport terminal. The room was clean, reasonably sized, though the dark decor didn't do it any favours in this respect. Noise was minimal considering we had an airport view and a monorial trunndling by, glazing must be very good. Once settled in, we went for a ride on the monorail, then feeling jet -lagged, returned to the room where we ordered enchilidas and burgers on room service. Service was prompt and food nice, but you get stung three ways for eating in the room: 1) the price of items on the room service menu is inflated; 2) they add an 18% service charge; and 3) they charge 2.50CAD to bring it to your room. Looking at other menus in other Canadian hotels, it seemed this triple whammy was not unusual. We would probably still have done it for convenience on this occasion, but it was still OTT. We did not have breakfast in the hotel, preferring to get our hire car and get on the road where we had great, reasonably priced breakfast in a diner style chain called Fifties.

The preferred guest check-in did not have a clerk present. There was no sign indicating to me or another business traveller that the counter was closed , so we stood there for some time. We finally gave up and stood in the queue with other travellers. Not a great start. However, main desk check-in was plesant, suite request was honored and a briefing of what services were available this late hour (including the 24 hrs gym). I elected to return to the airport after dropping off my belongings to get something to eat, as the room service menu offered heavy (burgers et al) or otherwise pricy items for midnight eating. The bed was comfortable though the duvet was too hot for me, the airport view was impressive and the higher floors did not have to deal with the new tram shuttling between terminals sliding by the window.

Work has taken me there but as a place to stay it is not bad. Close to airport - it is just a pain that you see it when you land from Europe but it takes you almost an hour to get there - not the Sheraton's fault - I blame GTAA and their \"in-field terminal\". It has the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. Food is pricey - but if you have a car there is a good selection of standard restaurants nearby - front desk staff will give directions. Minibar auto-charges if you lift something up - daft system especially if you are not a \"native\" and want to see the ingredients fo something before you consume it. Sheraton need to rethink this. Generally the staff are helpful - there are just a few sour faces that you learn to avoid if you are a regular !!", "Date": "October 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay, will stay again\u201d", "Author": "annievee", "ReviewID": "UR3940444", "Content": "Stayed recently before and after a trip down south.

It has been about 8 months since I stayed here previously and noticed no negative changes. Front desk staff were fine and can be described as cold and impersonal. The sound proofing of the rooms is incredible as I did not hear one single plane fly over. This was my first time sleeping in their \"heavenly\" bed and it truly was that kind of experience. I was going to explore the gym and pool area, however, ended up curled up in bed with my meal watching Desperate Housewives! Room service was prompt, albeit pricey (what else is new), and adequate. I left in the early morning and did not sample breakfast. My one minor gripe is the noisy air system in my room which I didn't keep turned on for long. This location is a good, functional property for business and overnight stopovers. Good room deals are available through expedia and hotwire.

As we checked in two separate times, we had a pretty consistent experience. The hotel is conveniently attached to the airport and accessible via an overhead skybridge. The check in process was not smooth as they have a separate desk for Starwood Preferred members. Despite standing at this desk away from the main check in, no one (on both occasions) came over to attend to us, so we lost our place in line by having to go over to the main check in line. On both nights the toilets were running and leaking water from the back of the toilet. There are no luxuries in the rooms, but they provide for the basic comforts ie. toiletries, separate work desk and chair, phone, tv, etc. On one night the bed simply had a comforter, the other night we had a duvet. I tried to order room service at 2am for a delivery later that morning. No one answers in room service and the front desk had to page them to call us back 20 minutes later! Very inconvenient for a hotel that presumably has guests arriving at all hours of the day and night. When the room service arrived, it reminded me of a bad cafeteria, with the plastic coffee carafe worn and coffee only filled 1/2 way in the pot, the bagel was toasted but cold, etc. Check out was more efficient and they offered to pay for our parking for the inconvenience of the sleepless night with the toilet the first night, etc. Overall, I would stay here again, but ONLY because of the convenient location of being able to cut parking time, etc. and roll out of bed and get over to the terminal, beating some crowds and aggravation.", "Date": "June 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wigan, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely beds and great beer at the Sheraton\u201d", "Author": "scouselatic", "ReviewID": "UR3583367", "Content": "Our second visit to the Sheraton within 9 months, having been impressed at our first visit when we were evacuated from Cuba due Hurricane and arrived at 2am.

Despite a false fire alarm during the night - we didn't have to evacuate due to an inroom 'tannoy' that kept us fully informed of the situation - we stayed again for a second night, the beds are so comfy, the view across the airport is great, absolutely no noise, and the bar has an excelent selection of Canadian and European beers. Restaurant also good, especially for breakfast. The hotel is not too far for visits downtown, 25/30 minutes, we used the limo service from the airport and the express bus service, if more than two then the limo works out great at around C$40 the bus C$9 each one way.

We had a 7th floor room overlooking the terminal and runway and our kids were very impressed with the view. The staff at reception were very professional and courteous. There were only a couple of minor irritants - firstly the hotel is quite awkward to access due to its extremely close proximity to the airport terminal, secondly the parking at $21/night is a bit steep (although it's very convenient), thirdly the mini-bar has an absurd sensor system that detects when you lift an item from its location and automatically bills you the requisite exorbitant amount.
