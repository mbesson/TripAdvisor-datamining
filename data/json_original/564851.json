The hotel is required by law to have a lifeguard on staff at the pool when the pool is open. The room rate was excellent-$134 a night which included two double beds as well as a $40 breakfast credit. The breakfast was wonderful. If you bring your car it was $20 to self park and the garage was right across the street. The staff was very friendly.

I quickly asked my assistant to just book me a room, any room, as I did not want to be left sleeping in a terminal somewhere waiting to catch the next means of transportation out of the city When she got online she saw that it was a \"name brand hotel, with a pool and that it was on the Upper East side\" and quickly booked it for me. She does not know the city well and did not understand how far up it was. When I saw the address I cringed, but thought, maybe it won't be too bad, after all, it's a Marriott. When I arrived at the location I was immediately very concerned, as it is directly across from the projects. I jumped out of my cab, with a slight worry on how I would catch a cab in the morning but proceeded in. Once into the hotel, I felt safe. The staff were very good considering the star level and location of the hotel. Informative and helpful. The wait staff in the restaurant were delightful and prompt on making sure I was taken care of nicely. The rooms were exceptionally large for the city, the housekeeping staff was quick in bringing me extra towels and the room was clean. My only real complaints about the hotel is that it is a bit tired, and the location is on the border of Harlem and directly across from the projects. If you are elderly or traveling with young children, this is something to keep in mind. But considering that the staff was incredibly helpful, even pointing me in the direction of where I could go buy a swim suit, and the premises were large, in the event that I was ever stranded in the city again, my only hesitation to stay would be the location other wise I would stay again Oh, and their wifi is excellent.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cSleep quality POOR\u201d", "Author": "djjbtoronto", "ReviewID": "UR124787430", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel the night of Feb 16 2012.

I stayed for two nights (Wednesday & Thursday) on business. The hotel room itself was alright---the bed was comfortable, the view was ok, and it was clean. However, it was clear that it was a little run down. Plus, the Jacuzzi is broken and the pool is FREEZING. My main issue with the hotel was the service.I called prior to booking the hotel to verify that I could send a large fax and make copies of a large document. They said no problem, so I booked the hotel. I arrived Wednesday night and let the front desk know that I needed to fax some items, and they did so happily. I was impressed. I then asked about Fed-Ex service. I clearly stated several times that the documents I was sending needed to arrive at my hotel in the morning. I asked if I should go to a Fed Ex store, but the front desk staff said no, they would send it. I filled out the mailing information and left the package at the front desk. They said pickup would be at 7pm. I then grabbed dinner and picked up my receipt from the shipment at about 8pm. The front desk staff didn't say a word when I picked up my receipt from the desk. The next morning, my office hadn't received the package, so I called Fed Ex around 1pm. They had no record of the package. I was out on business at that time, so I called the front desk. The woman told me that the package had not been picked up. She blamed it on Fed Ex for not arriving. I get that they have no control over Fed Ex. These things happen. But honestly, I should have received a phone call from the front desk staff to let me know that this had happened. I looked like an idiot in front of my office---they were expecting the package. I told this to the front desk staff, and they were extremely hostile towards me for the rest of my stay. The ice was dripping when I asked them to make the copies that I had requested in advance.

My room was spacious for a king sized bed room in Mid-town Manhattan where most of the rooms are cubby holes and the bed was super comfy. The room; including the bathroom was clean and the shower was nice a spacious.

Check in speed was excellent; I would recommend this hotel to anyone, but let me tell you why I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t probably stay here again. Upon check-in I decided to use the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s valet service instead of parking my car myself so that I may come and go as I please without being charged every time I used my car. There was no one outside to greet me and take my car. The security guard on duty informed me that the bellman would be down in a minute to take my car. It took another 15 minutes for someone to assist me with my car, and when he arrived he took a personal phone call for the next five minutes. I was informed that I needed to contact the valet service when I wanted to take my car out 30 minutes prior to coming down. Upon check-out my wife called the desk 30 minutes prior to us leaving the room. When we got downstairs our car was not available. After 20 minutes of waiting I asked the bellman if he could check on my car. Another gentleman, who informed me that he was waiting for almost 30 minutes after he got downstairs, asked the bell to check on his car as well. I was informed that my car was coming shortly; it took another 50 minutes later. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right; I waited an hour for my car. Apparently the person in PBX that took my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t inform the front desk, or the valet staff before he or she went on break. What really bothered me is the reaction of the staff during this time. Everyone from the valet staff that refused to answer my questions, to the two young ladies at the front desk who did nothing but ignore the guest in the lobby waiting for too patiently for their cars. Instead they took it upon themselves to take this time to make personal phone calls. As a former employee of Marriott, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember making personal calls at the desk being acceptable to be in our employee handbook. I do remember being told to feel empowered to assist the guest at anytime. In addition to ignoring the guest, the young ladies at the desk really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to care about the situation.

We went to the Guggenheim, Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Natural History as well as a couple of visits to Central Park. To get anywhere downtown, take any bus across town to Lexington Avenue (about a 20 minute walk). Hop on the Lexington subway at either 86th or 96th and it will take you to the bottom of Manhatten and all places in between. Central Park West is where the great hotels overlooking the park are located including The Dakota. There are numerous deli's close to the hotel including several fine restaurants. If you like Italian then try out Pinnocios - just around the corner on first avenue two blocks south of the hotel. The food was amazing. The only problem we had with the hotel was the elevators - only two and sometimes slow. We stayed on the 15th floor and would recommend you stay at a lower floor if available.

Had I paid the rack rate, I would have sobbed. The aesthetics and layout of the room were fine, and it was roomy by New York standards. The view was nothing special (7th floor, looking at adjacent building) - I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure we got the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Priceline special.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There hotel did have some pluses, but, unfortunately, there were also several BIG flaws that would prevent me from staying here again. 1. The fan controlling the heating and air conditioning periodically buzzed/alarmed LOUDLY every couple of hours. This made sleeping very difficult. The first night when it happened, I woke up in a half daze, first thinking it was my phone and later thinking it was a building alarm of some sort. It took me awhile to figure out where it was coming from. The next morning, I spoke to the management and was told that there was nothing that could be done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the owner of the building was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cheap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd apparently and had installed shoddy ventilation. The buzzing sound was normal and to be expected. We would just have to deal with it. I was pretty disappointed with that response as being able to sleep through the night is something I value. 2. On another noise issue, the insulation in the walls is not very good. Our neighbors were loud and obnoxious and continued to enter/exit their room until the early hours of the morning. Again, not good for sleep and just plain annoying. I so wanted to go yell at them to make up their mind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are you in or out?! 3. When we left our luggage after check out we came back to find it (as well as numerous others) just sitting in the lobby. The bellhop told us that they had run out of space and were just stacking it by the hotel entrance. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly comforting especially because he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for tags or ID when we took our luggage, so basically anyone could just walk in and take a bag. Also, not a big flaw, but a small one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any hand lotion or a shower cap. I kind of thought these things were standard in three star hotels? The general area of the hotel is okay and the subway is a bit of a hike. You can take the bus, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unreliable. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in a hurry the bus in an excellent way to get around. Otherwise, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stuck with the overcrowded subway on Lexington. We found the hotel to be too much of a hike to go back and forth to during the day. Once we left were out until night. In retrospect, it would have been nicer to be a little closer in. Also, there is small market adjacent to the hotel that was an excellent place to get snacks and water. With a little bit more walking, you can easily reach a variety of dining establishments, drugstores and markets.

Very comfy beds, plus the happy bonus of free (wired) internet access and free access to a fitness room, plus a handy coin-op washer-dryer on-site. But the real joy here was the service. The hotel has a friendly, outgoing, and dedicated staff. We had some minor requests (luggage rack, missing shower curtain hooks, stuck door on mini-fridge), which were fully handled each time in 10 minutes or less by friendly and efficient staff. When we encountered staff in the elevator, they introduced themselves by name and asked if we needed anything, as well as encouraging us to call on them for any needs during the stay. From the front desk, to the super housekeepers, to the maintenance and other staff -- everyone we encountered made us feel like we were staying in a family-run hotel instead of a chain. This neighborhood isn't going to be for everyone -- like much of upper Manhattan the rich and poor live closely together, with housing projects and fancy luxury high-rises literally next-door to each other -- but it worked well for us. It's definitely a long hike to the subway, but as former New Yorkers we were already familiar with the bus system (M31 and M86 almost at the door, the latter can take you to and from the 86th St stop on the Lexington line, or across town to the West Side), and taxis were abundant at all times except a.m. rush.

The restaurant on the premises is a joke with a limited menu, I never saw anyone in there my whole stay but we went there for breakfast anyway, I just ordered eggs/waffles/coffee for two and with the tip was $35, I ordered wheat bread and I had to wait till someone ran to the store to buy a loaf...TVs were new 27\" flat screen but the cable only had around 20 channels, self parking in a rip off, the parking lot is a half a block away and everyone there speaks limited English, I left two hours before my 24 hours were up and yet they charged me an extra $20 and couldn't explain why to me, Everyone told me to take the train or subway around town, but I didn't have any problems driving/parking at Yankee Stadium, Coney Island or downtown Manhattan, it took about an hour getting into New York City over the GW bridge on Sunday but leaving we made it over and into NJ in less then 15 minutes(no toll) Tip, if your driving around town, taxi drivers are fearless and will cut you off in a moment's notice with no fear of hitting you just to get their next fare, looking at local cars in New York City most every car we saw new or old had a dent, I left unscathed...lol", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cExceptional Service\u201d", "Author": "fultonferry", "ReviewID": "UR17519793", "Content": "On May 30th a friend of mine stayed in this hotel for one night after being evacuated from her apartment following a construction crane collapse in her neighborhood. While I didn't stay at the hotel, I did help her to check-in, and also got to explore the hotel a little. First and foremost, the front desk staff couldn't have been better. Even with an emergency in the neighborhood, they calmly and efficiently moved people from one room to another, and were kind and considerate to those who had been displaced. They never took advantage of the emergency situation by hiking up the price, and I thought for Manhattan the price was very reasonable. Special kudos to Daisy at the front desk who checked my friend in and was very helpful and accommodating. All in all, if the employees are even half as professional during a normal day and a normal check-in, then they are as professional as any hotel in Manhattan. The room and bathroom were very clean and while not big, was enough for one or two people. I didn't know what to expect from a Courtyard Marriott in NYC, but I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a clean, modern looking place to stay at a reasonable rate. This is not a full-service hotel, but you're in New York and within walking distance of many restaurants. It's also not the Four Seasons or the Gansevoort, but you're also not paying $600 a night (at least). The location is far from the subway, but there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel and has easy access to many of the Upper Eastside museums (the Met, the Frick, etc). It's one block from the East river and Gracie Mansion, which is good for joggers. All in all, it's a good choice if you want to pay a reasonable rate and don't mind not being in mid-town and instead being around real New Yorkers.", "Date": "July 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, D.C.", "Title": "\u201cGreat for business or a vacation\u201d", "Author": "daisygirl59", "ReviewID": "UR16752674", "Content": "I stayed for almost a week at the Courtyard Marriott while in town on business and had a fairly spacious (for New York) room with two queen beds, looking out on Ninety-second Street.

I had a moment of panic thinking there was no hair dryer, but it was hidden behind some towels. There were plenty of clean towels supplied daily, for once more than I needed. Beds were comfortable, and you are able to set your own temperature in the room, a definite plus. Really, the room was so up to date and functional you wouldn't believe you were in a New York hotel room. Free copies of the newspaper downstairs and a well-decorated lobby. The staff was fast, polite and efficient; I never had to wait at the front desk. Step out onto First Avenue and you'll find all kinds of restaurants. Down side? It is a hike to the subway, about 15 minutes on foot, and it can take awhile to hail a cab even on nearby First Avenue. There was no refrigerator in the room though it looked like there used to be, and for long stays you really, really want a refrigerator.

The rest of the staff was also very pleasant, but Mr. McNeil was to be commended for making this an extra special stay. Funny what personal contact does to make you feel at home.
