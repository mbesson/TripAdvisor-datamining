It is a little self-contained island that isn't in either the business or dining areas of the city, but it is an easy commute to more interesting locations. In Dubai, this isn't an issue as taxis are quite cheap. It is close to the Mall of the Emirates. I enjoyed the hotel pool and pool bar and usually had the place to myself during the mornings. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was comp. There is an English Pub, spa (which I enjoyed), restaurants, pool, and internet via cat5 cable only in the room. A generous, deep, full-sized bath tub (nice!). Clean comfortable room. This is an older hotel and the hallways seemed a bit dank and dreary but the room was quite nice. Two caveats: First, some rooms face the local light rail line and are noisy. Second, The Rattlesnake Club is a straight up brothel. You will certainly see Eastern European hookers passing through the hotel lobby, elevators and hallways with their gentleman companions in the evenings. But the Red Lion Pub was quite nice, and for the seasoned traveler the pluses outweighed the minuses. I might stay there again if traveling on business or solo, but never with a spouse or family. It is a pretty good value in an expensive city.

And the Burj Khalfa and Dubai Mall are just down the road. The Italian and Indian restaurants in the hotel both served good food. The Rattle Snake is well known in Dubai but that seedier side of the hotel is separate enough not to bother most guests too much.

I have heard other people complain about their rooms, service, etc., etc. but up until this time had not experienced anything but average service. This time, however, it was a completely different story! At check in I asked to have things from my mini bar removed so they would not put a hold on my credit card and I do not use that stuff anyways. They refused and said they HAD to charge my credit card. Then they come to your room at least 4 times per day checking the mini bar and the expiration dates of the things in there. I am not exagerrating! The first night I went to Don Corleone's Restaurant and brought the food back to my room to eat. By the way, the food there is excellent! I could not finish all of it so I left it sitting on the table for the maid to throw away the next morning. Also on the table was a newspaper that I had read so it was all taken apart and spread out on the table underneath the pizza box. When I left for the morning they came to clean the room (or so I thought)! They did make the bed! They left all the trash, did not replenish the coffee or creamer that I used that morning, did not leave toilet paper, left only one towel, folded up the used washcloth (I had used it to mop up some water that was on the counter) and put it back in the tray, and did not empty any trash can in the room. When I came back to the room I saw that this was not done so I figured they would come back later to finish and I left for the afternoon. When I returned to the hotel I had to use the internet so I went to the internet cafe. I told them I would only need to use it for a few minutes and they replied that I would still have to pay for the full hour (the minimum they sold was an hour) so I told them that would be fine. It was only 15 AED so I thought I might check my email later, so what the heck! I literally was on the internet for 2 minutes and when I went to get the password so I might be able to log on later they told me that you have to use the time continuously and you were not allowed to log out and come back. When I went to the front desk they told me that was the policy and deal with it! There was an American gentleman standing behind me that also could not believe this was their policy and he told me he was going to purchase time but was not now because of what he just heard. Then I returned to my room to find everything as it was when I left earlier that morning. I was mad so I called the front desk and they said they did not handle such things to call Housekeeping. I will have to say the young man that came to fix things was very nice and apologetic. He left plenty of everything! Later that evening I went to the Red Lion Pub to eat and get a beer. I walked in and sat down without so much as any waitstaff acknowledging me. I sat at the table maybe 20 minutes before I asked to see a menu and get something to drink! It seemed that they were put out to have to wait on me or anyone that was there. The service was minimal and horrible! The food was good. The remainder of my trip (I left the next morning) was uneventful. The hotel room is okay - needs updating. Plenty of hot water for showers. Close to Dubai Mall if you want to go shopping. I will probably stay there if we go back to the softball tournament but never for anything else.

It's an 'ok' place, but really needs staff training. Some folks make allowances for the staff if the hotel is just awesome! Some folks make allowances for the hotel is awesome! This place isn't awesome. It's holding on by a VERY wide diversity of restaurants and bars, which is nice. Prices are more than reasonable. There's no complaint on the money end- you get what you pay for. But there are some things that just need tweaking with the staff. For example, pulling up to the hotel in a cab, there were 4 attendants, dressed in white, gathered around a podium next to the front sliding glass doors. None approached the vehicle. I waited. I watched them. I waited. The cab driver lowered the passenger side front and rear window and one of the men in white approached. He asked if I needed help. I asked him if he was planning on opening the door for me. He opened the door. You just shouldn't have to ask. They were busy talking and missed an opportunity to represent the hotel. Getting the room was fine, however, I use a service that monitors my cards and accounts and within an hour of checking in, I was alerted my card and email were compromised. This obviously is VERY concerning. Housekeeping came daily as they do, only this housekeeper took the last cold bottled drink I had in a bucket of watery ice- placed it on the table she had just cleaned, and took the ice away. ?? Nuts. The room was intruded every day by a hotel employee wanting to inspect the mini-bar. There has to be a better way to get that done. If the guest is in the room- leave the mini-bar 'till later maybe. Or, let guests know if they desire a mini-bar refill to contact guest services. What's more, after completing his inventory, he picked up the phone and called someone to report. This is totally unacceptable. You simply don't take liberties of any kind like that. It's just presumptuous on the part of the hotel employee to utilize any piece of equipment in the room. Come on in, turn on the TV, hang out! I'd offer you a cold drink, but the housekeeper took my ice! The steak fillet from the in-room dining menu was unusually good. I was not expecting it. I am spoiled and want prime beef. It may not have been prime, but it was properly prepared and had fantastic flavor. Served plain with a side of some very bland mushroom sauce which did not bother me as I do not put sauce on steak. Unfortunately, however, NO STEAK KNIFE! It's the details that will make or break a place, and they need to work on the details.

You can share it with someone, I could not get my partner to try it so gave it away and do not regret it :) - There is a cinema connected to the hotel so there is something to do at night if it's boring. - The hotel provides you with a Dubai something magazine that tells you what's happenig in the Dunai in the nearest week, where all the special deal, happy hours and etc are, use it. Apparently we went to Trader Vic's a day after their 3days long deal on free ladies coctails was over. Just because we hadn't looked in the magazine. - Our towels were always clean, the room was quite clean too. - Most of staff is very nice and friendly, a couple of times we had to wait 10-15 min just to ask a question or sign something because there was only 1 person at the reception desk but it's not a big deal (only when you are rushing to jump into the nice cool water in the pool) Not so nice - Internet is sooo expensive, it's a rip off! Almost $9 per hour it's not even funny. - Beach is tooo far away, even though they give you a shuttle ( I think it leaves at 9 and then picks you up from the beach at 3.15) it is such a long journey, and if you can not wait for the shuttle or missed it or want to leave earlier - it cost us a lot of money just to get a taxi back (i think about $25). - Breakfast gets quite boring after a few days, selection isn't great but it's ok, we made the most of it. - The room wasn't big, we had to move the sofa to be able to properly open the suitcase.

We arrived several hours before check-in and the staff was very helpful about getting our rooms made up; the concierge held our bags while we we enjoyed a complimentary breakfast and waited. Albeit clean, the room was rather small with barely enough room to walk around. Beds were very firm, as were the pillows. The couch was comfy and the flat-screen TV was nice. The room also had a controllable thermostat. Internet was 30 AED for 1hr or 100 AED for 24hrs. It was also VERY slow! I was told that the wireless in the lobby was faster. (Rooms were wired, cable included) Breakfast was included with our room. They had a good spread - breads, cereals, fruits, some western dishes and some middle eastern dishes, as well as a egg bar (cooked to order). When we checked in, we were offered the \"executive package\" - this was 200 AED (300 for a double) per night and offered daily breakfast, all-day internet access, daily newspaper, complimentary airport transportation, and a 6pm late check-out. We opted out since all we really wanted/needed was the internet and we could get that for 100 AED. The hotel offers a free shuttle rides to the Mall of Dubai and the Mall of the Emirates. Shuttle ran on time (except when we had him wait for a few minutes so our travel mate could finish a phone call). Check with the concierge for times. The hotel is next to a cinema; we didn't have any interest with it so we didn't check it out. There are also a few restaurants in or near the hotel. Standard flare and decent prices. But, with so many things to do and see in Dubai, be sure to venture out from the hotel and explore other eateries. Other reviews have commented about the adjacent Rattlesnake and the 'women'. While I did not visit the Rattlesnake, a few of my mates did. They enjoyed the club and had a good time. However, we did not see any 'women' in the hotel lobby - they seemed to stay in the club. I wouldn't let previous reviews affect your decision too much about whether or not to stay here. While the hotel is older, it is centrally located in Dubai - malls and several things to do and see in either direction. However, with the exception of the cinema, the Rattlesnake, and the few restaurants, there is not much else close by. Use the free shuttle service or take a taxi.

We got discounted prepaid rates through booking.com. the hotel is what I would rate as a basic four star, staying in the delux double room was adequate - it didn't have a view or anything but that didn't bother me. The beds were extremely comfortable even with the aircon set to the lowest level it provided a nice gentle coolness that was welcomed during the humid October Dubai nights. The reception staff were friendly and helpful as were the concierge - however they lacked some local knowledge. There are a few bars - the popular one seemed to be the revamped sky garden with it's own shisha hut - the concierge didn't know the shisha hut was there ... I hired a car for the stay And driving was easy and with free parking at the hotel it came handy. Dubai is fairly expensive so be prepared to spend - the only thing that is cheap is fuel and parking. They operate a pay and display system which costs 2aed per hour - its free from 09.00 pm till approx 0800am an then between 13.00 and 16.00. The metropolitAn is conveniently located on shiek zYed road - but be under no impression that sheik zayed is a normal road - it's a 8 lane monstrosity but allows you to get through different parts of Dubai quickly. The burj khalifah and dubai mall are only few min away by car. Past that you have old Dubai and the souqs which are worth a visit - its something different and provides a more organic feel. In the opposite direction you have mall of the emirates with the ski Dubai centre, jumeira beach, Atlantis palm and Dubai marinA. The hotel does day passes to the habtoor grand palace resort and spa for 120 aed. This gives you access to the hotel pool, private beach and is worth it if you want to be able to enjoy the beach. Otherwise the public beach is available in a few locations though I checked it out near the jumeira beach hotel.\u00a0 Food wise I only had some of the snacks from the sky garden bar which were all delicious and value for money. The Swedish band playing popular covers were great. We just had one negative e experience with a waitress at the sky garden who for some reason claimed that the tables near the band were for groups of four or more yet there plenty of pairs and singles sitting there already - after causing bit of a commotion we were allowed to sit where we wanted.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Henfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWell kept standard 4* hotel from first hotel boom.\u201d", "Author": "KeithMander", "ReviewID": "UR118322971", "Content": "The Metropolitan hotel is located along the main Sheikh Zayed Road that spans the southern side of the city. It's positioned between two metro stations, with Business Bay being the closer - it's only a 10-15 minute walk at most but looks deceptively closer and in the significant heat, it can be a surprisingly gruelling walk too. Taxis are cheap in the city, but the major highway and one-way flow means that a taxi has to make a bit of a loop to connect between the metro and the hotel. Pretty easy connection from the airport - but a taxi is a cheap and hassle free alternative. There's not much going on directly around the hotel and you would do better to be near the Dubai Mall to closer to the main attractions and easier transport. Rooms and hotel facilities are good. Despite the hotel's age (it was one amongst the first hotels to open in the Dubai hotel boom), rooms and facilities are very good - it feels like your standard 4* Hilton/Starwood-esque hotel. Service is great - like most of Dubai, it's service workforce are largely of Indian origin and treat you great - I just hope they're well treated too.

We were made most welcome on our arrival and the friendliness of all staff prevailed for the duration of our stay. The room was clean, comfortable and well-maintained by the housekeeping staff. We stayed on a bed & breakfast basis and the breakfast was buffet style with a cooking station for eggs to order. There are several themed restaurants within the hotel although we did not use any of them. The grounds of the hotel are quite extensive and incorporate a large swimming pool which is accessed through an outbuilding and the hotel also boasts the oldest pub in Dubai which has a large outdoor seating area for drinks and food. There was never any problem with sun loungers at the pool. A free shuttle bus operates from the hotel to the Dubai Mall and also the Mall of the Emirates and the times are posted in the hotel lobby. These shuttle buses are not operated by the hotel but we found the schedule was adhered to very well. The hotel is close to the Dubai Mall and the shuttle bus only takes a few minutes to get there however if you catch the shuttle bus back to the hotel it will take over an hour to return as it serves numerous hotels and the Metropolitan is the last on the list. The plus side is that this will give you a free bus tour of Dubai right out to Jumeirah Beach Hotel and out onto the Palm to the Atlantis Hotel. Taxis are abundant in Dubai at any time of the day or night and operate on the meter without question. They are excellent value and are the best way of getting around the city which is not really designed for walking any distance. Similarly, when arriving at Dubai Airport there is no need to pre-arrange a transfer to any of the hotels. A taxi-marshall will direct you to your taxi from a well-disciplined fast-moving queue. There are three other hotels in Dubai which incorporate the word Metropolitan and you must specify to the driver that it is the Metropolitan in Sheikh Zayed Road. There is no shortage of money-changing facilities in any of the Malls. If you intend to go up the Burj Khalifa tower, this is accessed from the lower ground floor of the Dubai Mall. The best plan is to purchase a timed ticket for a day or two in advance and this will cost you 100 Dirhams. If you go along thinking you will just be able to go up the tower then you will be disappointed as it is mostly sold out for that day. In the unlikely event that there was immediate availability it would cost you 400 Dirhams. We booked two tours locally during our stay viz. A Dhow Dinner Cruise and a Desert Safari both of which we enjoyed. These tours cost 140 Dirhams (\u00a324.39) and 170 Dirhams (\u00a329.62) respectively. This was per person and included pick-up and drop-off from your hotel. If we had pre-booked these tours from our travel agent in UK they would have been \u00a349 per person - virtually double the price.

Just through the back of the hotel is the Pyramids cafe which is not part of the hotel and is used by the locals. There was no alcohol served here but the snacks and freshly sqeezed fruit juices were really good and realisticaly priced. You can also smoke Shisha here for a lot less than at the hotel. The hotel is well situated for Dubai Mall and The Mall of the Emirates. The hotel runs a free bus but taxis are cheap and its just a few minutes walk to the Business Bay metro Station. On the whole we had an enjoyable stay.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHookers Galore\u201d", "Author": "PlymouthTrish", "ReviewID": "UR87696130", "Content": "The hotel is clean, a bit dated , the room was small but adequate. The stories about the hookers are ABSOLUTELY true. We spoke to ex-pats there who worked in Dubai and were there just to drink, and were told The Rattle Snake is the oldest and most established hooker pick up joint in Dubai. The prostitution is everywhere in Dubai , but i think some are just a bit more discreet than others. Apparently the hotel charges the girls to come in, probably why they turn a blind eye, but the girls who dont want to pay. hide behind the trees outside the front.... they were everywhere. The hotel can be a bit noisy too, with the clubs turning out at 3am, and the music before hand. I personally didnt find it a problem but my cousin was ripping her hair out. Admittedly the hotel did get the music turned down after her second call to reception. The indian restaurant was OK, but the hotel breakfast was not good, although plenty of choice, but I have had much nicer food elsewhere. Alcohol everywhere is expensive, expect to pay between \u00a330-\u00a340 for a bottle of wine costing a few pounds at home . egJacobs Creek. This is the same everywhere in Dubai. Average pint about \u00a37 and spirits the same. Cockails on average \u00a310 . Its dear to eat out too. Trips - we went to the Burj Khalifa - excellent , a must do in Dubai. We also got a boat down the creek to the Gold souk, this was fabulous. We booked High tea at the Burj Al Arab, this was another must do, very expensive but wouldnt have misssed it. However I felt the place was really over-rated and tacky! The interior designer needs shooting!. We booked the desert safari BBQ thru the hotel with SunCity tours. This was a complete rip off. 2 hours in a bus, 10 minutes dune bashing which was fun, but the driver never spoke to us. Then we were dropped at the bedhuin village with about 1000 others who were all looking as bemused as us. They advertise the trip as including a camel ride. There were only 3 camels for all those people and they walked in a tiny circle and that was it! The food was awaful and you queued ages to get it. like the school dinner queue. There was loads of sitting about with nothing happening, then a brief act by a dancer and a fire act. Neither of which you could see because the people at the front stood up and refused to sit down. It was a totaly wasted evening. Lots of people were complaining, the next day after continuing our complaint we finally got half refunded. I had heard the trip was good, maybe with a different company it is. The manager of Sun City tried to pacify us with a bottle of Jacobs Creek between 7 and then tried to charge us for it the next day when we still complained. Dubai is a fascinating city, I am so glad i have seen it. However, give me the Caribbean every time. Great for shopping and lots to see, but once was enough for me.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201camazing\u201d", "Author": "Russ_and_hayley", "ReviewID": "UR87366665", "Content": "staff were amazingly helpful and wouldn't hesitate to bend over backwards to help with anything, taxi's are readily available, very clean and tidy and beautifully presented, rooms are fully equipped with anything and everything that you can need. honestly one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in, as a young couple we thought we may feel a little neglected but found it the complete opposite! defiantly would love to stay here again. would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. other reviews advised on prostitutes etc, we never saw any of this and didn't think it happened. hotel is in a brilliant position with free shuttles to the beach and malls, Dubai mall is only 5mins away and cost about \u00a34 in a taxi if you didn't want to wait for the shuttle.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, and well positioned for the Buiness District/Malls.\u201d", "Author": "mikedunstall", "ReviewID": "UR86083943", "Content": "I have now stayed at the Dubai Metropolitan three times, following a recommendation from one of our clients, in the last two years, and profess it meets my needs.

(1) Things started to go wrong right from check-in, handed my credit card over for the usual blocking of money to cover things charged to the room, however little did i know they did nothing with the card, hence when later that evening i came to charge a few beers to the rooms, was told they could only accept cash from me !!, complained at reception and was told i had not told them when checking-in i wanted this service... excuse me thought this was standard practice in all hotels ?? (2) Had requested non-smoking room, which i did get, however rooms on each floor have both smoking and non-smoking, so you can still smell the smoke even in non-smoking rooms. (3) All the other hotels i have stayed in in Dubai have always provided complimentary bottled water each day... not this hotel, was told water was only complimentary on check-in, and if i wanted more i would have to buy from room service or purchase from shop in the arcade, which i did for Dh2 each, what false economy from the hotel, times must be bad if they cannot afford Dh2 per day ! 4) Inside the room the furniture was pretty warn and decoration dated, stuck in 90's timewarp. Also there was only one double socket in the room, so you had to make a choice of 2 from either the TV, Kettle, phone charger, or laptop. And on this theme there is no way you could use your laptop plugged into socket and also plugged into the internet connection, they were just too far away. 5) Then there was breakfast... was told it was DH90 per day when checking in (which is not good value), however being hungry first couple of mornings decided to take it and signed for Dh90. On last day decided again to take but was only charged Dh70, and when questioned why the difference was advised there was a different price depending on what you had, but i had had the same the 2 previous times, however told it was my fault for signing for that price. Later that day then found out if you have the same breakfast in the coffee shop it only costs Dh45 !!!

You could use taxis,but make sure you use the public ones and not the hotel cars as they are twice the price. We visited the public beach and it was only 10 dirhams in the taxi. The beach is fantastic, you can pay a small fee for beds, towels and parasols and there are a couple of burger bars there which are fairly cheap and water only 2 dirhams a bottle. Entrance to the public beach was 5 dirhams. We used the hotel pool which was great, very clean and they provided towels free of charge for hotel guests and no charge for the sun loungers, which had nice thick mattresses on them. There is also a gym and spa treatments which we didn't use. Some reviews mention the fact that call girls frequent the hotel, There was only one person that we saw in the pub that we had suspisions about, but I didn't see any problems. Over all, we had a great stay, pity everything was so expensive.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cdo not stay here, this is effectively a glorified brothel\u201d", "Author": "veiledicequeen", "ReviewID": "UR57952098", "Content": "We stayed here as a stopover on the way back from Mauritius in January.

The resturauants back at our hotel were lively, we ate at The Red Lion pub in the grounds watching a large screen showing football, the food was plentiful and good. All the staff were helpful, and using the shuttles gives you a mini tour of the city each time. A relaxing day around the pool, where there were 3 staff, the swim up pool served cool drinks and a good lunch, again the towels and beds were very good. As others have stated there is a night club in the grounds where a lot of attractive women go, but who am I to say wether they're having a good night out or working and they never seemed to bother anyone, its far worse watching girls outside clubs in England than here ! Our only regret was taking the shuttle to the Outlet Mall, it took an hour to get there and if we had taken the shuttle back we would have missed our plane on our last evening so we took a cab, that cost quite a bit, but that has no reflection on the hotel service that was our missdoing, but still a mini adventure !

Nothing to write home about, just nice corporate style hotel rooms, great shower! -nice pool, clean, comfy sun loungers -good restaurants/bars no sign of any brothel as mentioned in earlier posts -excellent breakfast choice and friendly staff -free shuttle to malls and beach negatives: -Sun loungers fill up quickly so make like the germans early with your towel -public areas of the hotel are a little dated but sparkly clean -if you are a group of over 5 do not ask the conierge for any help, we asked for a cab for a certain time. We were called to say it had arrived, went down to get in it and were told it would be 80 dirhams basic rate as he had been booked for 2 hours and had been waiting for 30 minutes. We argued with the driver and the concierge and he took the drivers side. really irritating. We got 2 public cabs instead and payed the metered rate (v. reasonable, just count your change as they tried to fleece us more than once) -our room looked out onto the sheik said road-basically like the M1!! It wasn't noisy but might be worth asking for a room at the back of the hotel! Also top tip, for internet we were told by reception that it was 50 dirhams per hour wifi from your room.

NO, you can't walk to the beach even if it looks close at the map. The \"Sky bar\" aren't the best bar, try Vu's sky bar at the emirates towers. A huge drink list and tasty drinks. There is prostitution but you only see them outside The Rattle Snake and usually if you are around different hotel areas you probably don't notice it at all.

If you are going to spend much time on the Souks or Deira side, you should take a cab before the rush hours or else the taxi driver often refuses to drive.

The usual marble floors and comfortable seating greet you in reception and it has some lovely traditional features. The staff without exception were friendly and helpfull, they spent hours booking restruants for us with no complaints. The room was well furnished and clean as are the communal corridors. Be warned the third bed for our son was a camp bed which was incredibly hard, we requested a second mattress for this and it was there in 15 minutes. Breakfast was fine though we never ate in any of the other restruants. The pool area is dated and in need of a make over but the pool itself was clean. I admit that that the bar areas at the rear are a little bit scruffy but the new lounge bar off reception is elegant and stylish, we went there each night and it has a great atmosphere with friendly and efficient staff.

I have been propositioned by ignorant middle aged English guys when dining alone dressed in conservative business attire. It is not all that pleasant eating alone anyway, but knowing that people are speculating about you and even coming over to hassle you makes dining alone very uncomfortable.

The hotel is nice, average compared with other places in Dubai, with more research and time you can find a better place to stay for the same or maybe a little bit more money but it will be worth to do it, the rooms are quite small and dark, the swimming pool area is very nice, not sun after 2.00pm because of the location but still nice, they have a couple of restaurants there with good food but I will suggest to eat out, drinks are also quite cheap. There are also some bars at the hotel, I agree with other reviews about the prostitution it is really heavy there, they don't respect anything and approach everybody even if they are in couples, if you are bothered about things like that avoid going there. Finally, at the moment to pay our bill the hotel was charging us an extra 1300 dirhams (that is more than US$250), it was a mistake in the room rate and there was an extra day, we have to spend an hour explaining this to the lady because she refuse to change the invoice, I hear things like that happen very often so make sure to review your bill before charging the cost on your credit card.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "tr4v3lbug", "ReviewID": "UR15100856", "Content": "My First time to Dubai and i selected this hotel based on reviews and i was not disapointed at all.

However it is right next to the main road and necessary to taxi everywhere. All the front of house staff were very helpful, cheery and imformative. The buffet style breakfast catered for everyone - a chef making omelettes to order, cereal including porridge, cooked breakfast catering for Brits and Arabs, fresh fruit (whole and cut), cheese, yoghurts and not forgetting the bakery table! The tea was not great but I do recommend the mint tea. The restaurants seem to be really busy with non residents too - we ate at the Italian (Don Corlease) which was fine (not great) and the Fish Bazaar - absolutely fantastic. The staff very attentive, the decor interesting. You choose the fish you want and then the sauce over it - so good we went back again! Also in the evenings, it was very nice to sit in the lobby and listen to the piano singer. The pool was adequate although lacked the afternoon sun. Quite far from the main hotel.

I made the reservation through the Exhibition center's housing unit so I believe I paid less than the rack rate. This hotel was rated 3+ stars by the housing center and I believe it to be accurate after staying here. It was the least expensive hotel on the list. I've read the reviews here and they are mixed, and depend upon the point of view. If comparing to other Dubai hotels, this is one of the older ones (1979) and less classy. But if you're looking at international comparisons, the Metropolitan compares favorably. The hotel provided a pick up at the airport which was certainly a benefit if , Like me you are a first timer and don't know the roads. But if you don't tell them in advance what flight you are arriving on, they won't know to pick you up. They also gave me free drop off at the airport for a 2am flight which helped alot. The breakfast included was quite plentiful, with omelet service, indian and middle east food, plenty of fruits and juice. They we're very amenable to making cafe Latte for my wife each morning. This hotel seems to be a fixture in the community. Even after staying a week, I didn't realize there were more than half a dozen restaurants including what seems to be a most popular bar for expates (The Rattle Snake), indian, chinese , italian restaurants, a pool, gym, softball fields! apartment residences in the back. The location is highly recommended for commuting to the exhibition center and taxi fare only about 14dirhams each way. By comparison, the taxi fare from this hotel to Jumeirah was about 33 dirhams alone.

THE HOTEL The hotel opened in 1979 - according to the photographs in reception. Whilst not being as grand as some of the newer hotels, it most certainly has been refurbished during the past 28 years and was pleasant, spotlessly clean and comfortable. LOCATION The Metropolitan is a good base for a short break in Dubai - the location suited us, & I would agree that it was no more than 30dhs (about \u00a34) to get to anywhere in the city or Jumeirah Beach. Taxi's were easy to get and seemed the usual mode of transport for even a short trip (where you would walk in another resort, you just can't in Dubai as all roads are ring roads and 4-6 lane highways. They are not exactly pedestrian friendly, but that's Dubai!). FIRST DAY We arrived at the Metropolitan just after 9am - following an interesting transfer from the airport. The experience of being a car passenger in Dubai is a white knuckle ride in itself! This was not just down to our driver - local newspapers, guide books and taxi drivers will all confirm that driving in Dubai is not for the faint hearted. As mentioned in a previous review, we were also advised that to get our room early would incur a charge, alternatively we could use the hotel facilities until 11am when our room was ready- we chose to go and have breakfast, and then laze by the pool which passed this time easily. Once checked in, we were then rested & ready to explore the city. ROOM Our room was a 'Superior' room - which is actually a standard room and sadly didnt have tea & coffee facilities available. The housekeeping service was excellent and our room was serviced every day by Irwyn who didnt just replace towels, but made every effort to keep our room tidy & organised (I wish I could find his equivalent in the UK to employ to clean my house!!) Our room was facing Sheikh Zayed Road so no problem from the Rattlesnake bar (*see later). Admittedly not the best view - but then I didnt go to Dubai to see it from my room. RESTAURANTS Restaurants in the hotel - Summer Palace (Chinese), Don Corleone (Italian) & Shahjahan (Indian) were all lovely. Excellent service & good food. If you are staying here for several nights, it is worth knowing that each morning you will get a flyer hanging from your door advertising a discount in one of the restaurants. This is good if you dont mind the fact that that will dictate where you eat that night. The discounts were 25% off the bill (food not drinks). The Red Lion Pub was the usual 'British Bar Abroad'. We enjoyed watching the football & rugby that was shown on large screens in the Beer Garden. Bar food here is great when you just want chips! (You can take the girl out of England, but you cant take England out of the girl....!) Staff were great, particularly Dinusha who worked relentlessly to keep the customers happy, sometimes when faced with some quite rude & obnoxious tourists, she kept a smile on her face and was just adorable. CONCERNS.. Now: the prostitutes. - That made me concerned after reading previous reviews. But it really is not so bad. The Rattlesnake Bar which seems to be the attraction for these people is at the back of the hotel in a separate building. We simply never went in there, so no problem. Once or twice there were some questionable 'ladies' in the Red Lion. But to be completely honest, I never noticed them until my boyfriend pointed them out to me. And even then they seemed to target local ex pats more than tourists (?!?). For anyone who is concerned about this problem at the Metropolitan (And I was), I would advise not to be worried and you can feel completely safe here. MONEY Despite our rep informing us that we would be able to change travellers cheques in the hotel - this is not possible at the Metropolitan. Apparently they have had problems recently with fake travellers cheques being presented, so no longer offer this facility. A short taxi drive will take you to the Western Union exchange centre within a large supermarket to change travellers cheques. Alternatively, if you wish to pay by credit card, a whopping 10% admin fee will be added !! Beware - Dubai is a city where they like your money, and they like it in the form of cash...... HABTOOR GRAND (SISTER HOTEL) From the Metropolitan you can use facilities at the Habtoor Grand Resort on Jumeirah Beach. This costs 70 dhs (\u00a310) per person and is money well spent. The pool at the Metropolitan is clean & comfortable, but the Habtoor Grand is much nicer and there is the opportunity to walk along the beach and see what is happening at the Palm Jumeirah - we were able to go up to the '25th' (restaurant on the top floor) for stunning views of Palm Jumeirah, the Burj Al Arab & surrounding area - TIP: go up about 4pm when the restaurant is empty and they dont mind you going to have a look. We saw some better views here than we did from the Burj !! Also, they didnt advertise this, but you are able to use the courtesy buses at the Habtoor if you are staying at the Metropolitan: this meant we could stay later at the Habtoor and return via Mall of the Emirates later in the evening. BURJ AL ARAB Like many, we did not want to miss the opportunity to visit this iconic place. During our trip we met other tourists who had booked their visit to the Burj before their trip and I would strongly advise this. Once in Dubai, you can only book (for tea, lunch or dinner) via your hotel and we did via the Metropolitan. This is far more expensive and we felt that our 'guide' was looking after his own interests more than ours - he clearly was making a huge profit and although pleasant we did not see everything we would have liked - we were able to go to the top floor in the lift, but only able to see the view from the lift as there were diners in the restaurant. Similarly we never saw the basement restaurant looking out into aquarium? (I only learnt of this once back home). Our 'Guide' then took us to an Art Centre, which initialy sounded nice and an added extra. Once at the Art Centre, where all goods are available for sale, it was again clear that this man had a business interest in the place, and once we made it clear that we were not going to buy anything, the visit became more hurried and we were quickly escorted back to our hotel. Nevertheless, lunch at the Burj was fantastic, make sure you dont have a large breakfast and be prepared to feel like you have just eaten your Christmas Dinner! MUST DO's Dow Creek boat trip - see the city in an hour. worth doing. Iranian restaurant in the Twin Towers, Deira. 40dhs (\u00a35ish) for as-much-as-you-can-eat buffet lunch. Dubai musuem - see how quickly the city has evolved. Big Bus City Tour - Great to orientate yourself, but beware - your ticket may well be valid for 24 hours, but where ever they are at 6pm they will stop the bus and thats it until the next morning.. Gold Souk / City - Girls, wear a sensible clothes or have something to cover up with. Its not compulsory, but I felt better for a pashmina and watched girls uncomfortable in strappy vest tops & shorts... In one sense, apologies for a lengthy review, in another, I hope there may be some useful information for fellow travellers - we had a great holiday in Dubai, it is certainly an interesting and constantly changing city. I hope we have shared the good and the bad which may assist others. We had a great experience, but with the benefit of hindsight, would have done one or 2 things differently eg Book your Burj visit before you go !!!!", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex, UK", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for....\u201d", "Author": "Mond", "ReviewID": "UR10064496", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel recently on our first visit to Dubai.

We ate at a few of the restaurants at the hotel. The Fish Bazaar is excellent. We also ate in the Summer Palace which was ok. There are two bars at the rear of the hotel as you head towards the pool and gym complex, one is a pub that looks like the Rovers Return. The other is the Rattle Snake. We went to the Rattle Snake for a couple of drinks one evening before going for dinner and the Thai prostitutes seemed to arrive by the truck load. We left at about 8.30 as it became a bit uncomfortable, they pretty much attached themselves to any man in the room - even my husband when I went to the toilet which was rather amusing.

I denied flatly that I had left them there and that one of the staff must have planted them. MR ARUN and his staff then started laughing and smirking. Which really got my back up!!

He and his rude, incompetant staff denied any responsiblity and said that as they were back, and no1 could prove they were taken or washed they would do nothing about it. I asked for a letter from the hotel to say my clothes were ruined (my insurance company needed it) and surprise, surprise MR ARUN flatly refused to write one. All he would offer me for compensation for my distress was a poxy fruit basket, which I told him he could stick where the sun doesnt shine! My experience of Dubai was ruined by this terrible hotel.
