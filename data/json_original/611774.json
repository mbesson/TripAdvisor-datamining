It is distictively different than all those chainhotels. The rooms are well sized, but you need to book a room to the back (rooms ending with 09), if you are susceptible to noise. All other rooms reach to the street and do not really have soundproof windows. Since there is NO airconditioning you cannot open the windows unless you are completely oblivious to noise. No ironing board or coffee maker in the room either. The cuddly downcomforters are extremly thick and are inaedequate for a hot day in Germany. The flatscreen TV has a good choice of TV stations in the area. The staff is very hospitable and courteous and bends over backwards to meet your needs. If you arrive after 11 make sure, though your key is in the coded box out front by the nightdoor, otherwise you are out of luck. There are no keycards, so loosing a key could be costly. Also a second key is not given to you, so two in the room have to share the one key you get. This can be cumbersome. If they had free softdrinks and free Wifi again like before this hotel could be among the 20 best hotels In town. The included breakfast on the topfloor is worth a visit to the 5th floor and even disposes of an open-air terrace. in Berlin you will find plenty of hotels but unlike this they almost never have this individual italian flair.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mijas-Costa", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stylish decor & flair, friendly service, delicious breakfast.\u201d", "Author": "Damifina", "ReviewID": "UR68560911", "Content": "Since I had to travel to Berlin for business and took my wife with me, we opted for a more romantic style hotel with a nice decor in a quiet location and this was a good choice for price/quality. The Mediterrainean style appealed to us very much and we were pleasantly surprised by the decoration and ambience of the hotel and also the size of the room ( the \"Komfort\" room at a 10 Euro surcharge) and abundant coffee and tea making facilities in the room. The bathroom was nicely appointed and stylish, but had one drawback, being the glassed-in shower in a very awkward place between the sink and the toilet, making the space tight. The builder must have been sleeping or maybe dreaming of the Mediterrainean, when he installed it in such a way. For us it was not really a problem, but I can imagine that people with a fuller figure or a handicap would find it somewhat difficult to manouever. The wardrobe space and furniture was very adequate, although we would have appreciated a lamp above the working desk, and unfortunately the safe didn't work properly, but we didn't make a fuss about it. The staff was very friendly and helpful in arranging things for us and the breakfast buffet in the stylish rooftop garden room varied and delicious, although they ran out of some dishes when you came late for breakfast. All in all we were very pleased, especially since we thought the price was quite allright for what you get.

The front desk staff was very nice and helpful, taking joy in giving us directions or advice. The hotel is a business area, but just a short walk from a U-Bahn stop, which made getting to the touristy areas very easy. The italian restaurant in the hotel was already closed at 8pm on a Saturday night, so the front-desk clerk directed us to a trendy bar & grill about 2 blocks away that was very good. Breakfast is quite good, lots of pastries, warm food, cereal, and drinks. Everyone else eating was always in full suit and tie, so every day when we would arrive in our jeans and t-shirts, the hotel worker would eye us suspiciously and ask to see our room key (this despite the fact that it was the same worker all 4 days, I guess she never trusted us), and never asked any of the businessmen to provide their keys.

However, although the room is attractive, the facilities are very poor - no tea or coffee making facilities, a VERY expensive minibar (four quid for a bag of crisps?!) and no complimentary toiletries (a nightmare given that our shampoo, shower gel etc had been stolen by the good people at the Ryanair check-in). The room was incredibly hot with no way to regulate the temperature except opening the window, onto a very noisy and busy main road, so sleep was difficult either way. However, the real problem with this hotel is the fact that there is NO-ONE THERE AFTER 11pm. Literally no-one. Therefore, if you go out of the hotel without your room key and arrive back after 11pm, hard luck - you are sleeping on the street. Or if you pop into a friend's room after 11pm, and your door accidentally slams behind you (as happened to me), you can't get back into your room without ringing an emergency number (found by chance on the wall in the lift). Yes, someone turned up an hour later with a master key, but I then got charged 55 euros for an emergency call out! I dread to think what would have happened if there had been a real emergency like a fire or a break in. The place is like the Marie Celeste as soon as the clock turns 11pm and I found this astonishing for a four star hotel in a capital city. In terms of location, it's ok - very near a U-Bahn station but on a line that was tricky to get to the more popular areas such as Unter den Linden without several changes. The breakfast was a self service buffet, and nothing out of the ordinary. I am amazed that this hotel has four stars.

I was not informed there was a shuttlebus and was forced to limp to the hotel along a streets lined with used-car lots as, even with a damaged leg, no taxi would transfer me. My reception was off handed and I was given a room in an annex over the restaurant. In the restaurant the waiter tried to retain \u20ac7 as a tip on a \u20ac13 meal. In my room I was kept awake through the night by a combination of traffic nose(road <20 metres away), train noise (main line railway <50 metres) and mosquito bites. On waking at 6 am I found a door outside my room connecting directly to the street was wide open and I assume it had been so all night. Security ?? Needing an early transfer to the centre of Berlin I needed to check out early and came down to the restaurant at 6.30, the advertised start of the meal but nothing was ready and I was told to wait 5 minutes, that turned into ten and for my \u20ac7.50 I eventually got 1/2 cup coffee a glass of juice and a bread roll before I had to hurry away. On check out I was offered a shuttle ride to the station by the receptionist but after speaking to the driver I was told I could either wait a further 10 mins or walk.

The closest subway station is Fehrbelliner Platz, so the trip to the centre of Berlin or the main station takes about 20-25 mins by public transport. The hotel is decorated in an Italian style which I assume is supposed to resemble a \"baroque\" theme. I liked it as it is pleasantly different from all those mainstream chain hotels and - apart from the reasonable rates, the design was my reason for choosing it. What I did not like is that the hotel does not have aircondition which is quite unusual for a four-star hotel. I was staying during a hot summer night and could not find any sleep due to the heat. To get a little bit of air, I had to keep the window open which resulted in the street noise getting in. The duvet they provided must be the same used year-round as it was very thick and warm and hence not useful for summer time. The small fan that was in the room was insufficient. The breakfast was served in a nice surrounding on the fifth floor of the hotel with a lot of daylight in the room which was nice. The food selection and quality was average, but considering this hotel has four stars it could have been better. On the plus side, there is a free internet pc next to the reception desk, while other hotels in Germany still try to make big money out of this service.
