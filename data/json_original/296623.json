I don't know what the folks from Ottowa are talkin about because we have never found a speck of dirt in the four years we have stayed. We were also there in February and the staff was as nice and attentive as ever. The front desk people all speak english to us all the time. The maid can not speak english but we have never had a problem. There was a group of young very loud and rude soccer players that were asked by the hotel staff to quiet down after many complaints from the other hotel guest. I am suspicious that may explain the very bad review they have given. The food and drinks are great. The cheviche is the best in Playa and the breakfast is included. I have never heard anyone complain about the food or drinks, in fact it is one of the reasons we stay there. Our first year in Playa we stated at the Aventura Mexicana and although the hotel is nice the food was bad and it was too far from the beach. We had stumbled upon the Alhambra while walking down the beach and fell in love (Especially with the Margaritas) The Maquito Beach Hotel is next door and is very nice but it is also expensive.

I'm not sure whether the other resoundingly positive reviewers had significantly better rooms than we had or significantly lower expectations but either way we found our room to be a big disappointment. To start, I will say that on the positive side, the room was clean which is a big plus. Also, the air conditioning in our room worked just fine. We were in room B. It was pretty large but as pointed out by other reviewers it was furnished with whatever miscellaneous bits of furniture they found lying around including a futon bed/couch which I suppose is intended to serve as additional sleeping space. Unfortunately, they didn`t find a TV or phone lying around as neither were to be found in the room. The bed was ROCK HARD and was appointed with a single, very thin, very hard pillow for each of us. There was a single top sheet and a thin bedspread and we found a questionably clean blanket in the room which gave us tolerable insulation for the night (we had to keep the AC on to remove the humidity). The bathroom had two bath towels but no additional linens such as hand towels or wash cloths. There are two small windows in the room: one has a view of a 4 foot gap between buildings and the other opens into a ventilation shaft. Really - they thought a window into the ventilation shaft would be somehow appealing. Warning: we had a couple of drinks at the Alhambra beach bar and when we went to pay they gave us an exchange of 10 pesos per US$. I tried to convince the server that this was unusually low but he wouldnt budge. At the time we were getting an exchange of between 11.5 and 12.5 pesos up on 5th Avenue. FWIW the hotel when they converted the room rate to US$ used an exchange rate of 13 pesos per US$ so they know what a dollar is worth, they just don`t care to acknowledge it at the bar.

We stayed at the Alhambra room D oceanfront, from Feb 8-15, 2010. I had been to Playa del Carmen several times before, but she had never been out of the U.S. or even on a plane, and she was justifyably a bit worried, so I wanted this to be a positive experience for her. I noticed all the great reviews for the Alhambra, and I am a kundalini yoga student, and I don't watch TV or use hotel phones, so the energy and philosophy of the place looked like a nice fit. i was a bit troubled to see the somewhat critical review by Greenie-300 on January 31, though. Our experience was quite different and wonderful, so I feel compelled to write about ours. I booked the hotel apartment room 4 months in advance online, had a lot of dialogue on line and in person with Daniel and Fernando, and I got what I believe to be the best room they have. They gave me a better deal than advertised by booking 7 nights, so you might consider staying there the whole time. The apartment has a separate bedroom with queen size bed, shower, hair dryer, a/c, two sofas, two desks, a kitchenette, two patio doors, large patio, table, chairs, with a fabulous ocean view, terrace overlooking Calle 8 with coconut trees next to it. Lots of floor space in the front room too. It could easily sleep 6. When we arrived, we were greeted cheerfully and warmly welcomed. Madai at the desk knew who I was when I told her, and they carried our luggage to the room. The room was very clean and orderly. Brenda, our maid, folded our towels into swans, flowers, and other beautiful sculptures, and kept the place spotless. I offered to pay for the room up front, but Madai said I could pay at the end of my stay, which I did. There were no surprises or hidden costs on the bill, and the tax was included in the price, something that many other hotels don't do. There was a problem with the a/c remote control, but they fixed that promptly, and showed us how to program the safe in the room. I left some valuable things out, and nothing was touched. They gave me keys to the room, to the patio doors, and to the main entrance door, to gain access after hours. They close the doors around 10pm, so if you go out dancing or clubbing on Calle 12, etc., you must make sure you have that entrance key. Because I'm a geek, use Facebook, Skype, and email a lot for business and pleasure, the only thing that was challenging for me was the internet WiFi service, which is only available in the lobby. I told Daniel about my concern, and he said they are going to install WiFi very soon so that it will be available in every room. In fact, they had a guy coming out to look at it the day we left. I don't care about TV or house phones. I text people back home with my cell phone, and the service works well in that area inside and outside the hotel with T-Mobile. There is a small spa, but with the ocean in front, that's all you need. theswimming is amazing. There are yoga classes every day at the Alhambra if you're into it. If you don't want o opt for an ocean front room, there are rooms on the side where you can still see the ocean, and they are much cheaper. The rooftop is open to anyone, and it has a great view. Watch out for the large log legs on the beds. Easy to stub your toes. There is noise at night from the clubs a few doors down, but it didn't bother us. There was fire dancing and drumming two doors down one night, and I walked down to watch it. Really cool. Got my photo taken with some monkeys, ate at some great restaurants, and got plenty of sun. I come to Playa for the warm weather, the ocean, the sand, the restaurants and shops on 5th Avenue, the clubs, the people watching, the Mayan ruins, the culture, and the magical energy. The beach in this area is beautiful, and the turquoise water is just a few steps away. If you have never been to Playa, you are in for a wonderful surprise. There are many places to visit in every direction. I highly recommend the Tulum ruins, and the great beach there, just south of Playa. You can take the ADO bus for about $6US per person. Be sure to bring lots of water. You can fly into either Cancun airport or Cozumel airport. From Cancun, you can take a taxi for $50US, or the ADO bus for $8. I usually take the bus to Playa. You can pay in pesos and board it just to the right as you exit terminal 3 at CUN. It's a first class Mercedes bus and very nice, unlike the city buses in the U.S. It stops at Juarez and 5th ave, which is a short walk to Alhambra at Calle 8. Going back to Cancun airport, I took a taxi this time, because it was easier. If you take the ADO bus to Cancun airport, it will stop at terminal 2, and you will have to take a shuttle to terminal 3 for international flights. Daniel arranged the airport taxi, and as per his suggestion, we got there 3 hours before departure. I'm glad we did, because there was a long wait at baggage drop. If you can, consider flying into Cozumel, taking a short taxi ride to the pier, and taking the ferry to Playa, which is just a few blocks from the hotel also.. I did that once, and I prefer it, but I have had trouble finding affordable flights to Cozumel. The ferry runs almost every hour until 9pm, and of course you can also go from Playa to Cozumel too. The restaurant in the hotel is quite nice, and the food is great. Breakfast is included with the room, so we ate there every morning on the beach. The freshly squeezed orange juice, coffee, pancakes, omlettes and bacon were great. The waiters are really nice guys. Be sure to tip the waiters, the maids, and the people at the desk. They really appreciate it and deserve it. Is the Alhambra more expensive than an all inclusive, large resort with airfare included? Yes. Yes. Quite a bit more. If you want to stay in a Holiday Inn atmosphere where you never leave the building, and have your itinerary figured out for you, perhaps you should talk to a travel agent and stay somewhere else. If however, you're like me, and you enjoy the energy of Playa, you like diversity, unpredictability, smaller hotels, the beach, the ocean, like to swim, like new experiences, enjoy shopping for unusual things, etc., you like to buy Cuban cigars, Mayan blankets, pretty dresses, jewelry, eat at many different ethnic restaurants, and you love to be near the beautiful Caribbean Ocean and white sand, then I highly recommend the Alhambra and the wonderful, cheerful people who run it.

Only the maintenance guy was friendly. The room was plain and the bed was very uncomfortable. One of the pillows had a sour dank smell and the decor was random. It would not take a lot of effort to make these rooms better. There is good space but the decor and comfort were lacking. Everything was clean, and the shower was good, but it was not worth the price and we would not go back. There was wifi in the lobby only. The location was great, right on the beach, but the way the beach chairs were squashed together in very tight rows, with no space made me feel claustrophobic. If you didn't get a seat in the front row, forget it. The chairs are also available for people who are not guests.

This was our first trip to Playa del Carmen and we wanted some place in town. Hotel Alhambra was perfect for our needs. It's charm quotient is high! It is located barely a block off of 5th avenue and is on the beach. This is not a fancy place, but it's so charming, sweet, and has a definite Mexican feel. No watering down of the local culture factor here. We had never stayed anywhere like this in a resort town before and am so glad we chose the Alhambra and to stay in town. We stayed in the large room on the beach side on the top floor. You can see by my pictures that it's very clean and summery fresh. They also provide plenty of bottled water in your room which is free. The view from this room is fabulous and will keep you happily occupied while drinking your morning coffee. On the con side, it was somewhat loud after midnight due to bar music down the beach. I use earplugs so it didn't bother me much, but my husband didn't have any. Also there is not much space for your clothing, but it would not keep me from coming back. Bed is hard, as most are in Mexico. There is no pool and we don't require one. There is the gorgeous sandy gulf footsteps from your room. The rest of Hotel Alhambra is very homey as if you have a little apartment there. There isn't an uncharming corner in the place! They have a very large rooftop sunning area which would also be great for family or group gatherings. We only ate breakfast which was part of our room price and it was very good and of normal size. You can eat inside or on the sand outside. There is coffee downstairs in the morning and you can bring a cup to your room. The location was absolutely perfect for walking up and down 5th Avenue. You should know that when you get to Playa del Carmen you will have to pull your own bags down to the hotel because 5th Ave. is a pedestrian only zone. The cabs let you off as close as possible and it's really only a short two block walk, but you will see other people doing this too for any accomodations east of 5th avenue.

The whole place, details included are all white, pristine and calming. our room had a wrap around balcony looking out onto the ocean and out to Cozumel. while there was ac, the abundance of windows let in a constant breeze keeping us quite comfortable and able to fall to sleep to the sound of the ocean. Every morning we went to the hotel's restaurant, Zabor, which provides a complementary breakfast, the chilaquiles, while not in the traditional style, are outstanding, (try them with a sunny side up egg on top - my new favorite dish). after breakfast on the beach, we would take a dip in the warm ocean and head back to our room which was cleaned daily by a wonderful group of women, who were totally trustworthy and thorough. we loved coming back to see the sculpture they had created out of our fresh towels. There is also an abundance of purified water throughout the hotel, either in one's room or just down the hall.

Price - the low season rate, for a beachfront hotel, is quite reasonable. 3. Clean - enough said. Pretty spotless hotel, and the room & linens were immaculate. 4. Breakfast - included in the price is a variety of made to order breakfast entrees that you can eat on the beach. A real plus! 5. Staff - whoever I dealt with was quite friendly. Cons - 1. Beach - this section of beach cannot be compared to where I have been before, down at Mamita's on 28th street. It's not very wide, there's rocks at the entrance to the water, as well as seaweed and a lot of debris churning. Quite disappointed in the quality of the beach, which was the main reason for booking. 2. Room amenities - no in-room safe, no TV, no small fridge. No one goes on vacation to watch TV, but it's nice to check the news, or have something to do when the weather is bad, and you don't want to be outside in a rainstorm. 3. Noise - we could hear noise each night, especially from the musician at the Italian restaurant right next door. 4. Hotel policies - a bit annoying to be honest. Full payment was expected at check in, and you need to put $20 deposit for each beach towel. They only give you 1 key, and any more is $20 deposit each. Since the doors of the hotel are shut at 10pm sharp, this is an inconvenience when you have a single key to the hotel and room. 5.

I work in the hotel business and within five minutes of checking in (Hola, Britta!), realized that we were in a place where the staff took great pride in their establishment.

We would lay in our extremely comfy king size bed and see palm trees and the ocean. I don't need much more to be happy. Breakfast is served under palapas and palms at the oceans edge by an efficient and friendly staff - ( please be a decent human being and tip - just because breakfast is complimentary doesn't mean the waiters are doing less work!) There are beach chairs for guests, but because of hurricane activity in past years, it appears from old pics that the beach has shrunken a little, a factor out of the hotel's control.

This is not a hotel for the party crowd, and we were thankful for it. We had some of the most restful nights ever on vacation, largely because of its location.

Our 7 year old still raves about the great time he had playing on the beach with his cousins. We had an ocean-view room with a balcony facing the ocean and slept with the sound of waves every night. Fresh linens and towels plus we could check out beach towels as well. Our own 5 gallon container of purified water with a fridge was a nice extra plus there was a purified water dispenser in the hallway as well. THANK YOU! For those of us with kids, that fridge was a lifesaver and worth the extra $. We shopped at a local market and bought beer, yogurt, fruit, milk and cereal for those times we weren't up to going out to dine. We could replenish our water bottles and stash them in the fridge. Cost saving measures for sure but really, it's more about the saving of time and not having to go out each and every time you need something. From the waiter, to front desk personnel to housekeeping, quick efficiency made that hotel hum. Never were we told no, every request was attended to. We were in town for a family wedding, and had the front desk arrange for a wonderful day trip to Tulum and Xel-Ha. Payment arrangements, pick up in front of the hotel ... with lots of children in tow, a much appreciated amenity. Beach front location was primo. We ate breakfast (included) and then lounged on the chairs after the staff set up the beach umbrellas. Five star service at reasonable prices. A low key, clean hotel without an attitude yet close enough to high end restaurants/hotels AND funky out of the way, local restaurants. LOVED THE CENTRAL LOCATION. The wedding party, from Mexico and California, will certainly return for a family reunion in the very near future. We've stayed in some of the finer hotels in the US (Loews, for one), and I must say, for the money and the overall goodwill of the staff, this is truly a gem of a hotel.

Our room was on the 3rd floor, overlooking the beach, directly next door to the yoga room (our's was the nicest room they have - according to Eduardo). It is pictured in their brochure - and acurately. The room was very clean, large, came with a refrigerator and a 5 gallon water dispenser. The air could have been a little cooler - but was adequate. We did experience a little trouble with hot water the first day - but for the most part it worked well - sometimes you had to let it run a while. The balcony was nice for people watching -but was quite windy at times. The pool (or they call it jacuzzi - but not hot) was mostly for looks - but good for refreshing. The rinse shower is located near the lobby - an inconvenience when you want to rinse after swimming in the ocean. The staff was very nice, from Eduardo at the front desk to Roberto (we loved him) at the restaurant/bar/beach service - both spoke excellent english and were very helpful and friendly. Location - excellent - 5th Avenue just one block away - everything within easy walking distance. Beach - the beach was nice - and even bigger by the time we left - gained about 20 feet.

Three drawbacks - 1) on Sundays and holidays - this section of the beach becomes quite busy - good day for sightseeing. 2) A popular dive shop moors their boats just in front - although they are gone all day - it is entertaining watching people trying to get in! 3) They don't really clean the beach - like the resorts do - we watched a big huge piece of burlap wash up on the beach - none of our hotel staff - or surrounding hotel staff picked it up - they just let the sand eventually bury it - very strange. All in all - it was a nice beach . Dining - Breakfast in included with your roon - nothing to write home about - but convenient. Not sure if the coffee was instant or what?? It varied daily. We - being from the NW - do like our coffee - so mid-stay discovered a coffee house 2 blocks away (on 5th) - great lattes. Did not eat lunch at Alhambra - as breakfast was marginal - we did eat lunch next door at Playa Maya - great guacamole, decent food. Area Dining -The hotel is just one block off 5th Ave - and all kinds of restaurants. However, we prefered the local cuisine better than the 'fine' dining restaurants. I just think that Playa's definition of fine international dining and mine is different. We ate a lot of meals at Los Almendros on 10th Ave and Calle 6 - Excellent Mayan food! Very inexpensive - and only a few blocks away. Margaritas were good. Not fancy at all, plastic tables, chairs - but really delicious - wish I could remember the name of the Mayan pork - only served at night. The dinner menu is all in spanish. A nice upscale restaurant for dinner was Yaxche Maya - just up from the hotel on 8th - very good Mayan food - more intimate, beautiful garden dining, excellent service. Both of these restaurants were recommended at [-------------] Transportation - this trip to Playa - we decided to use the Riviera Bus from and to the airport in Cancun. We were a little skeptical - but it was great. They travel every hour, they are air conditioned, comfy seats, bathroom, TV's (that play the same show over and over). The bus terminal is about 4 blocks from the hotel - we walked - make sure you have a rolling bag - or your bags are light. The cost - $8 per person each way - and the bus is direct - no stops. I understand, from friends we made - that you can take the same type bus to Cancun (or Isles Mujeres w/ferry) for about $4 each way from Playa. It's a great deal - and comfortable/efficient. All in all - we thought our stay at the Alhambra Hotel was very nice and would recommend it.

We stayed both in a superior room and a standard room and found, oddly, that the cheaper standard room was much bigger and much quieter than the superior room which had a view of the ocean from the balcony.

Not the greatest service-- there was a snafu when we checked in and they weren't particularly warm or accomodating about it, but overall, for the price, it's fine. The new hotel next door (The Mosquito, I think it was called) is way nicer and we were a bit jealous of their accomodations but it's also twice the price.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cGood Little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "MDigre", "ReviewID": "UR4966179", "Content": "We recently stayed at the Alhambra for 2 nights on a weekend trip to Playa del Carmen. Normally we stay at a friend's condo but it was booked. This was our first experience at an \"in-town\" hotel in PDC. Even though \"in-town\" the Alhambra is still on the beach and just steps away from 5th. Everything was very clean. The room was small but had a balcony with a sea view. The outdoor restaurant/bar/beach lounge area was a great place to spend the day starting with the included breakfast. Nice massage facilities. Ask for Charly who is a great masseur. Wonderful service from the restaurant/bar staff who made us feel very much at home.

The door opens out because there is no space for it to open in. One step in and the shower, sink and toilet are all at your fingertips! The location right on the beach at Playa del Carmen was the best thing about the hotel. There is a rooftop deck area that offers nice views of the beach and the free breakfast on the beach was nice. The rooms were clean, service was good during the hours that it was staffed.
