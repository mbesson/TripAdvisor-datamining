I gave up my car rental because it was 20Euros to park in their tiny parking lot with an SUV. There were very few places and a time-consuming process due to space constraints. Hotel is located just around the corner from S-bahn and it is only 14Euro ride to the Tegel airport. We purchased the 22Euro pp \"City\" Bus tour around the city valid for 2 days and it was ideal for hop-on/hop-off. The bus driver even picks you up at 9am at the hotel and the closest tourist point is only a brief walk of three blocks. Rooms were newly renovated. If you have a handicap person in the party - room 113 is ideal! There are 5 steps up to the area for the restaurant which would be an issue if unable to walk. However, hotel has an elevator so getting to the rooms is no problem. The TV's were the old tube kind but the beds were comfortable, excellent lighting and enough closet space for suitcases. We didn't have views on the first floor except to an inner courtyard but the casement style windows functioned beautifully and you could get nice frest air and no noise except birds chirping. Lobby bar is sophistated and convenient. At check-in we were given courtesy certificates for a free beer which may be part of the Best Western FF program. The bar tender aka concierge aka front desk staff let us substitute for whatever we wanted soda or wine. It's not the kind of hotel that will recognize you by name or know too much about tourist attractions but they are friendly and accomadating. Breakfast served from 6-10am had a center island with breads, jams, scrambled eggs, bacon, cheeses, fruit, cereals, juices, pots of coffee on the table. It's not your American plastic plate and plastic forks - this Best western had tablecloths, silverware, china and nice presentation. Hotel is located close to several pastry shops, grocery stores, Gallery mall, walking street, lots of shopping, there were musicians on the street. I would stay at this location again if in Berlin but would check out the crowne plaza or radisson closer in the tourist area too since In June the Tegel airport is closing and the new airport is much further out of the city.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cReasonable place to stay for the price\u201d", "Author": "m5893_tripad", "ReviewID": "UR125626442", "Content": "I've stayed at this hotel 3 times for a few days each in the last 3 years.

Now the bad: Our double-occupancy room was spartan, providing only the essentials and nothing fancy or luxurious. There were no drawers for us to put clothing. No luggage rack to put our suitcase on. This was an issue for me because a back condition makes it difficult to bend down and retrieve clothes from floor level. My needs were immediately communicated to the staff, who assured me \"one was on order\". Although we stayed 5 nights, I never received one. We received ONE face cloth for TWO people EVERY DAY. We had to request an additional cloth EVERY DAY. Soiled drinking glasses were never moved or replaced with clean ones...for our entire stay. No access to ice.

Front-desk: very friendly and supportive, great staff Parking: in garage, is EUR 20 a day, if I remember correctly; but parking space is few and far between in that area, so just park your car in the garage \u2013 get yourself a surprise, you don\u2019t drive the car into the garage\u2026.. Room: two types: the ones to the street (Kantstra\u00dfe) may be loud, a 2 two-lane street that is, with lots of traffic; they also offer rooms into a yard/garden, call these rooms \u2018business rooms\u2019, which we had \u2013 and these are very quiet (slightly more Euros though, but a good investment), quiet, even when the window is open \u2013 there is no a/c, so some fresh air is needed, specially in summer. Furniture I\u2019d say could be more posh, but room was ok in size and quality. Only thing we disliked was the strange smell in the bath-room; we assume the syphon of the shower (open shower, syphon in tiled floor) needs some anti-syphon trap, or in other words, something, so that the smell, from where ever, can\u2019t escape into the bath-room and then into the room. That problem, however, seems to be a problem of #315, as the other rooms, according to the plan presented on the floor, seem have a much smaller bath-room, and thus a shower with no syphon directly in the floor. Breakfast: was ok, but more or less average fot that type of hotel, with friendly staff. Miscellaneous: access to Berlin-sights is perfect, various means of public transport readily available; pedestrian-zone with lots of shops just across the street. Summary: would go there again.
