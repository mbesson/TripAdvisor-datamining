You are paying close to 50% cheaper than any of the better 5 star hotels that are in the same location. In fact, the peninsula is just next door and the intercontinental is right in front of it. So it is insanely great value for money. And I need to remind you again, the location is AWESOME. Close to: star ferry pier, MRT, sogo supermarket and freshmart, intercontinental hotel that has NOBU, SPOON, and other nice restaurants, next door to peninsula's afternoon tea and felix bar, 5 minutes walk to harbour city mall, HK space museum (2 mins walk), HK museum of art, etc. The catch is... this is not a 5 star hotel to begin with. It is not even a decent 4 star hotel, and certainly loses to luxury boutique hotels. The room is so badly decorated, and the bed is harder than my kungfu practice mat. The bed is a brick, covered in sheet. The pillows are, of course, super soft. I had the worst sleep ever during my world travels on this bed. I stayed in a deluxe harbour view room.

The first visit gave me a really good impression, which is why I continue to use it. From a single business traveller's point of view, it's fine. If you don't mind the presence of large groups of witless tourists staying there on cheap deals, then you'll be OK. The rooms are not huge but they work... however if you are travelling with many people and suitcases you will be crowded. For SPG members, there is a club lounge but it's a bit small and food is limited. For proper eating the main restaurant is good enough though, with a large buffet and well-prepared food (for a buffet). But this is Kowloon... why would you want to stay in the hotel to eat when there are so many restaurants outside, and across the water in HK? Talking of HK, the Star Ferry (preferred method of travel) still runs a service to the island, but if you prefer to use the metro Tsim Sha Tsui station is very close to the hotel. Octopus cards work on everything. To sum up the hotel... not the best, but perfectly serviceable.

The bed was also comfortable, which is very important for me.

The receptionist told me beforehand that if I wasn't happy with the room she'd be happy to change it for me. And as it turned out, I wasn't happy with the room, and so I called the front desk and requested for a change. Which they did, to the better room with a view, where I stayed for the entire vacation.

A large corner room, windows on both sides, the first thing that strikes you when you enter the room is the spectacular view; it\u2019s definitely worth paying the little extra for the room. If you can\u2019t then the roof top pool will give you the same views. You can see right across to Hong Kong Island and the wonderfully lit up buildings at night. There is a small amount of traffic noise even on the 12th floor but not too much. A large glass top desk sits in one corner, a comfy armchair and glass coffee table in the other. Flat screen TV, mini bar and tea coffee making facilities fit into a unit. The wardrobe is large with deep drawers and plenty of hangars. The bathroom is a good size, with a walk in shower and large bath, a glass wall is between it and the bedroom, giving you the views whilst washing. A lovely glass washbasin adds the finishing touches. The bar in the ground floor has a good selection of drinks on offer, a good selection of restaurants and shops are also within the hotel. The cafe for breakfast is very busy at all times so if you have to be out early get up very early as you may still have to queue. The food on offer is very substantial, tea and coffee is brought to you, everything else is self serve, we were spoilt for choice from fresh fruit and yoghurt to the usual cooked breakfast items, both Chinese and European tastes catered for. The pool is a bit small, especially when you have Olympic hopefuls trying out their strokes! There are sun beds and a lifeguard who hands out towels and picks up those left by people who can\u2019t be bothered to put their dirty towels in the wet towel bins. Complimentary water is also on hand. You are very close to the Star Ferry terminal and over the road from the Space Museum and the Museum of Art.

These were hard shell suitcases, so they could not \"expand\" or get any larger on the way back. They decided to shove one suitcase into a back passenger seat, and I had an uncomfortable ride the whole way back to the airport - crammed into the back seat with another passenger. Uncomfortable and extremely disappointing. The room was very cold most of the time, and the temperature could not be moved any higher than 24 degrees. The suite was extremely large for hong kong standards, well appointed, nicely decorated and was very clean. Room service on our first night was disappointing, with not all of the \"24 hour\" menu available when we ordered. The staff were all friendly, polite and attentive. The breakfast buffet at the Cafe was a highlight of our stay. However, allowing a guest to repeatedly smoke for over 3 days on a non-smoking floor is completely unacceptable. There were just too many failures during our stay to give this hotel a good rating or recommendation.", "Date": "July 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but dated\u201d", "Author": "jinphil_cho", "ReviewID": "UR132931042", "Content": "I needed to stay at a SPG hotel for one night in Hong Kong (even if I live in Hong Kong) so a Single room at the Sheraton fit the bill best for price and convenience. I stayed here a long time ago and I've stayed at numerous hotels in Hong Kong over the years so I had a pretty wide array of experiences to compare my stay to. When I first checked in it was very apparent that the hotel was busy that night and I ended up being stuck with my original booking of a Single room. The room was very small with just about enough room for a bed, side table, desk and an old tube TV. The bathroom was also very small, but felt a little less dated than the rest of the room. I was very disappointed because while I didn't expect very much from a Single room, the Sheraton is by no means a cheap hotel. I don't think they should even offer Single rooms if they're of such poor quality. I had a comfortable enough night in my room but I can't say too else positive about the room. The best part about this hotel is the location. It's located right above Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station and across from the Peninsula hotel in the heart of TST. Almost all the important areas in Hong Kong are easily accessible from the hotel's location.The service from all the staff I encountered was very good, which somewhat made up for my disappointment. Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel, especially with the excellent and nearby W not much more expensive and so many other options both in TST and the rest of Hong Kong.

The concierge staff goes out of their way to recommend their own airport shuttle, which I don\u2019t understand. Everyone knows the fastest way door to door is to take the MTR Airport Express. It took us less than an hour door to door, including checking in our bags at the Kowloon station. However, the bell staff did walk us out to the stop with our bags so that was a nice touch. Overall, I\u2019m not sure we would consider staying back at the Sheraton Kowloon because of the small room size and the amount we paid.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "Stuart M", "ReviewID": "UR129372229", "Content": "Stayed here for five nights on business with two of my colleagues.

Upon arriving i was allocated a Harbour view room which i had paid extra for, the room in question was 518 and to be fair if I pressed my face right up against the window i could see the harbour, looking straight out my view was obscured by buildings. I asked to be moved but the hotel was full (unless i paid extra of course, which in my view means it wasnt full), regardless of being a Starwood Privilege member no joy. The room itself was old fashioned (as most of the hotel is now) and is in need of a refurb asap. The carpet is an old floral design and you could see the dirt on your feet if you were bare footed. On the first night i rang down at 6.30pm to ask for two shirts to be collected for pressing, I was told that the last collection time is 7pm, so they might not be able to collect that day, I know its not the smallest hotel in the world but 30 minutes should be ample time. After complaining to the front desk a lady appered to collect my shirts, she was very rude and abrupt, telling me that the shirts would be dropped back off before 10pm, when i explained I had just arrived and that i longed for my bed so a morning delivery would be better i was told no, tonight before 10pm, despite my plea's the shirts arrived back at 9.45pm. Another shock waiting for me was that the breakfast had now risen to \u00a328 per head, expensive even for a four star. At checkout i checked my bill and noticed i was being billed for 9 lots of Internet access, 1 for each device per day, as unbelievable as it sounds the hotel still charges HKG150 per day for wireless use, after explaining that it was 2012 and for \u00a3250 a night i would expect the internet to be free they finally agreed to only charge me for one device per day, if i had not stood my ground this was not being wavered. The sad thing about all this is that all my staff stay here, or at least they used to, the Shangri-la is much better value and they know how to look after you.

The hotel is on Kowloon in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood right next to the famous Peninsula Hotel and on Nathan Road which is the epitome of high-end Hong Kong Shopping. We felt the location coudn't be better since we could see the famous 8pm light show from our room and it is so easy (3 minute walk) to walk right to the Harbor (Avenue of Stars) if you want to hear the music along with the 8pm light show. The hotel is about a 5 minute walk from all the shopping your heart desires and also a 5 minute walk to the Star Ferry so that you can take the ferry (less than $3) over to Hong Kong Island where you can visit Victoria Peak, the IFC mall, etc. The best view is from the Kowloon side so we'd recommend against staying on the Hong Kong island side as those hotels are more geared to business travellers and don't have the good view nor the good shopping. We thought the view at the Sheraton was better than the Intercontinental because the Intercontinental is right on the water in the corner and it is harder to see the entire light show from there - even in the good rooms. There is a Sky Lounge on the top floor of the hotel that has fun drinks, dim sum and afternoon tea (British Influence). There is also an Oyster Bar and another restaurant. We ate at the Chinese restaurant twice = once for dinner (award winning and delicious) and another time for Dim Sum lunch. We highly recommend it! The room was very modern and there was see-through glass to the bathroom but it wasn't like some hotels and you would still have privacy when in the shower and using the toilet. We stayed on the 8th floor and even though that was in about the lower to middle floors of the building it was still super quiet despite the street below and we slept very well. Also, even though it was only the 8th floor, we still had a fantastic view. We took a taxi to and from the airport. They tack on $5HKD per suitcase and there is a $10-$30HKD charge depending on which bridge/tunnel toll the driver takes you. It cost us $235 HKD from the airport to the hotel and $245HKD from the hotel to the airport (Red taxis = blue and green are for other regions). We would recommend taking a taxi if you are more than 1 person because it is much more convenient (quick & easy to get taxis both at the airport and the hotel) and it is faster than the train or airport bus. It took us less than 30 minutes each way door to door - even in traffic. It was also more economical since there were 2 of us and the taxi dropped us off right at the hotel as opposed to the airport train which we'd have to walk with our luggage or take a bus or taxi anyway.

I have travelled over much the world and all over Asia on vacations. I am a registered architect. It's not glitzy or fantasy. It just works so well and is very,very well thought out. To start with, there is room for two suitcases to be opened up and accessed. Why do so few hotel rooms account for more than one guest? Then, there are flat surfaces to spread out on without having to clear away all the signs, book, clutter and crap which most hotels cover every square inch with. So too, the bed night tables are multi-level to hold phones and writing pads and all the stuff required by the bed, all the while leaving the top free for the guests' use. Seems simple, so why do so few succeed at this? Then, the main furniture across from the bed is one clean and simple unit holding the drawers, TV, the mini bar. Instead of multiple furniture pieces like most hotels, it is like a functional piece of office furniture, thus no icky un cleanable spaces inbetween. Even the desk is a glass oval hanging off the main piece. And low and behold there are plenty (plenty!) of data and power outlets right there at the desk - built in clean and lovely, not down on the wall somewhere, not an afterthought. Yay! Then, the bathroom . . . what a joy! One, there is a nightlight so you don't get blinded and wake a sleeping partner during the night from turning on the bright bath light like in most hotels. The sink area - at first I thought two sinks was over ambitious in such a small space. But there is a shelf built in all along under the main sink counter, effectively doubling the counter space. And the main counter surface is glass, so you can see what you've put below to access it and not forget anything when leaving. Brilliant. Then there's a separate wet area with the tub and shower sectioned off by a glass door and partition. It is perfectly proportioned space-wise. It keeps the bulk of the moisture out of the sink area (love that) and bets of all you can see yourself shower in the full mirror over the sink, owing to a lack of curtain or mirror fog. Sexy. I could go on. The curtains are enclosed on three sides neatly by a partition wall making them tailored and neat. The closets like the main furniture are one large almost ship-like well designed and built in unit. Whoever designed this room deserves some real kudos. I LOVED it. Like I said at the top, it's not high design. But it works a million times better than anything I've stayed in by Phillipe Stark, or any W Hotel travesty.

Easy remedy = toss a towel on the floor, and there is a drain there as well. (2) The lighting in the bathroom is too low for my taste, so I end up drying my hair and doing makeup, etc., near the desk. That's not a problem, since there is a full mirror there, and the shelf with plugs that I just mentioned, but that may not be true of people who aren't travelling alone. (3) I really wish that the WIFI was free in the hotel. More and more, it's common for it to be included in the hotel rate, particularly our corporate rate. It also makes the billing and travel expense reports more cumbersome to have to separate out and report the charges.

It did not sound that bad in the beginning, but the reality hit me immediately \u2013 it was a smoking room on the smoking floor (which, by the way, the hotel staff did not mention at all!). The horrible smell hits you immediately when you step in from the elevator and while you reach the room you can\u2019t breathe anymore, and in the room it\u2019s even worse. Having suffered the first nigh, I have got an upgrade to the harbour view room for the rest of my stay, though on the 5th floor, not on the top. Overall the rooms (and the hotel in general) is very tired and worn out. Rooms are quite small, though functional: you even get an adaptor if you forget yours (as I did). Free WiFi is not available in your room (only the one you have to pay for), which I think is too bad for 5 star hotel. Breakfast Busy, noisy, not relaxing at all. It helps, that hotel staff will find a free table for you. Food selection is good, although smaller than I had in other 5 star hotels in Beijing and Shanghai during this trip. Healthy smoothie was my absolute favourite! Hotel amenities and staff Free WiFi in lobby very slow. A few computers available \u2013 80% of them were not functioning properly for 3 days in a row. Health centre on the top floor was quite good \u2013 with an outdoor swimming pool, a few whirlpools, gym and sauna department. Spa treatments were at a very expensive price. Staff is friendly and helpful. The check in, though, took way too long. Location This one I will definitely give a 5 star \u2013 within a few minutes walk to MTR and Star Ferry Terminal.

The lobby of the hotel is quite grand with sitting areas and unlike Langham Place, is well lit and bright. However, the lobby was always busy and fairly crowded. The lobby seats were always occupied and so I never had a chance to sit on them. The lobby also contains a section with computers that provide complimentary Internet.

I had also arranged private transport from Hong Kong airport to the hotel. The service could not have been better. You are greeted at the Sheraton counter as you leave the baggage area. You are then escorted to a Mercedes luxury sedan where they load your luggage and you step into a comfortable experience, which is very important for me as I travel alone with my 10 year old son. Fortunately, this time we invited my dad over, who was staying in China, to join us for the week, hence we needed the two beds. Being a Towers guest, you have your own check-in on the 16th floor. When we arrived, our luggage was tagged downstairs and we proceeded in check-in on the 16th floor. As you can imaging, it was very busy since it was Christmas eve. We were escorted into the lounge where we were offered drinks and a comfortable lounge to relax. My credit card, reservation, and passports were given to a check-in hostess and when everything was done, I got everything back and our room keys. The lounge has a fabulous view of the Harbour and Hong Kong Island and it was nice to enjoy this view after a 15 1/2 hour flight from Toronto. When we proceeded to our room, our bags followed shortly - about 5 -10 minutes. We were very happy with our rooms-- only we would have liked a non-smoking room, but they were great about getting us an air filter which we enjoyed for the entire stay. Breakfast was included at served at the Oyster & Wine bar. Great buffet selection and also hot menu selection ranging from American, Chinese, Thai, Japanese breakfast. On weekends, they also served champagne. The lounge has an afternoon high tea service and in the evening there were cocktails and appetizers until 8:30 pm You do have access to the lounge 24 hours if you only need to grab coffee/tea/soft drinks/water with your room key. There is a light show every evening at 8 pm, which we actually watched from our room or the lounge. The location is great for walking around and the Star Ferry Terminal is very close.

Unfortunately I did not get to eat there as there was a function or wedding there every day of our stay. The Oyster & Wine bar has the most delicious crab cakes I have eaten! The lobster salad was also excellent. As for service, the staff are great and top notch...no complaints at all.

Lobby was packed with people milling around and there was a long queue for check-in. I must say that it was the longest hotel check-in that I have ever experienced and the reception staff was apologetic saying that it was because of Chinese NY. No upgrades for non-platinum SPG members except being placed on the SPG floor overlooking a sad courtyard and billboard. King bed seemed smaller and lower than standard King sized bed in Starwood hotels but staff assured me that it is a King sized bed. Well, sleep wasn't as good compared to the other Sheraton hotel we just stayed in on a King sized bed. Buffet breakfast wasn't as great as the other reviewers posted. The bread and cakes were dry, bacon rubbery and coffee was too strong and almost undrinkable for me despite putting lots of milk. The saving grace was the fruit section, husband loved the fresh pineapples and I enjoyed the blueberries. Concierge staff were helpful although not very familiar with MTR travel costs. The room itself was okay and always kept clean, complimentary bottles of water were plentiful. Accessibility was the main feature of this hotel. The hotel is smack bang in the middle of all the action: Star Ferry, MTR to Mongkok's night market and Kowloon's Elements mall, high end shops in Harbour City, electronic and golf shops. We were tired of Chinese food so we bought New York style pizzas from Paisano's for 30HK dollar per huge slice, this shop is located in Granville Road.

The location of the hotel was perfect as it was right on the parade route and close to the harbor for the fireworks display. Being platinum members, we were upgraded immediately to one of the executive suites which had a living room and separate bedroom. The room was very clean and bath/shower was strong and hot. The service at this hotel was good. Everyone was polite. However, there was a little problem during our stay... Since we were staying here in January, it was quite cold outside. Upon entering the room, my wife and I attempted to turn up the heating using the two thermostats in both rooms. I turned them up to about 25 degrees Celsius and waited for the room to warm up. Thing is: that never happened. It actually got colder. So we figured it was broken, we called downstairs and asked if there was something we were missing (some hidden button on the thermostat that I didn't notice or something). They ended up telling us that there was no heat in the rooms, and that the thermostat was, in essence, there for 'show'. It didn't matter what temperature you set, nothing would change. We then learned that the entire building was centrally controlled, and that they do not turn on the heat in the hotel until 8pm each night. With our room freezing, we obviously complained about it and that they needed to do something to accommodate us. They told us that they have small space heaters that they can send up to rooms - however ALL of them were in use by other rooms. Hmm - what should that tell them if ALL the heaters were being requested? They said that have 700 rooms but not 700 heaters. This was obviously not on with us, so we wouldn't give up until they gave us a heater (even though they said they were all out). We then found out that their own employees have heaters in their offices! So they gave us one of those to use. I would like to note too that even after 8pm with the 'central heating' turned on, it was still damn cold. They told us that the central heat is set to 22 - 24 C when it's on, but with what we felt - not way that was the case. Anyway, other than the temperature problem - the hotel was fine. I just couldn't believe a rated 4-5 star hotel with a top SPG category rating doesn't have the ability to let its guests choose the temperature in their own rooms.

Comfort: the beds are fabbo, the rooms are quiet and very clean, they have one of the best showers of any hotel I have ever stayed at. Safety: the rooms have oversized security lockers, the doors locks and security features are excellent and the rooms \"feels\" safe, the hotel also has ample door/security staff although not overly visible. It's a matter of expectations with any hotel, sometimes the brand suggests more but for Hong Kong I believe the Sheraton Towers has gotten it just right, a nice blend of service, quality and comfort. 2 final points I want to mention: the concierge(s) at this hotel are the best in the world from my experiences and do an incredible job at assisting. In my case, I want to save money by NOT using the hotel laundry and they always remain neutral on this point and facilitate a local laundry to pick up and drop off.....I have used this service about 20-25 times. This hotel knows I have a preferred room and after staying here for 3 years very regularly - they always facilitate and actually are the first hotel who really take my profile into account without me having to contact them.

Tip: if you are staying at the top floors, try to avoid rooms near the elevator shafts: the noise of the elevator engines at night will keep you up and unhappy!", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "worldwide", "Title": "\u201cPost Card View\u201d", "Author": "livesinhotels", "ReviewID": "UR121910305", "Content": "As others have said if you get a harbor view you\u2019re in for a treat.

This gives you the harbor view without the room price. Club floor also includes h free cocktails from 5:30-8:00pm with a good appetizer buffet and great little desserts. I have stayed in this property many times and gave it three stars because the suites are small and they need to be freshened up. Also they took away the laundry amenity which was a couple of pcs. Per day. It has been cut back to 1 pc. pressing on arrival and shoe shine. Another reason I gave it three stars is the internet service is PAINFULLY SLOW! YOU CANNOT USE V.O.I.P. Also the rooms are small in relation to price. The location is perfect for taking the Airport Train which connects to the Hotel shuttle station. It stops at about five hotels. Cost is about $10 US and its $25 less than a taxi and takes about the same time during peak traffice hours. The Metro is 1/2 block away and makes getting around a breeze. I also commend the staff in going above in service. My last trip I lost my passport. You require an appointment at the embassy and a police report. The staff filled out the police report faxed it in and got the copy back in less than an hour. They called the night duty officer at the embassy and made an appointment for the next day. I had temporary passport two hours after my appointment.

The hotel is right in the middle of a very lively section of Kowloon (TST). It's conveniently located near the trains and easy to get taxis as well. The lobby is nice, nothing crazy. The room was a decent size but it had a phenomenal view of Victoria harbor! No need to go somewhere to see the 8PM light show, it was best viewed from my room. The bed was great (as most renovated Sheratons are these days) and the bathroom was super cool. They use some kind of all glass (clear sink). The room and hotel were always super clean. As a Platinum SPG member they also provided free breakfast every morning. The buffet was huge and had all types of food options (from Eggs to noodles, fruits, cereals, yogurts, and pastries. It was way more than sufficient. The surrounding area has a lot to offer in the way of food and shopping. And you can easily catch the ferry or a taxi across the harbor to LQF if you want to party (but be forewarned about the high drink prices in LQF). The hotel also has a rooftop bar which is pretty cool too. Finally, existing the hotel was easy too. I hopped on the free bus which stops just outside the hotel and takes you to the Air train station. You can check-in for your flight and drop your luggage at the train station (which is awesome) and then get on the train to the airport).

Descent Hong Kong hotels tend to have smaller rooms at a higher price, and the Sheraton was no exception to this rule. The rooms were definitely smaller and more expensive than other Sheraton properties we have stayed at in China. Service here was by far the best I have experienced at any hotel I've stayed at in the past, That welcoming feeling started right at the door when arriving by taxi. Every employee smiled and greeted us. The biggest surprise came on my birthday. My wife had told them nothing, yet I was treated to cake at breakfast, and in the evening on our return from dinner we found an entire cake, complete with candle and matches in the room. I presume they got my birthday info from either my Starwood membership or my passport at check-in. Because I had booked a \"tower\" room, check-in was on the 16th floor. It was a comfortable process, with all of the extra facilities explained in detail. The tower rooms did carry a higher price, but the additional \"extras\" like free internet, breakfast, afternoon tea, etc., made it a better value. Our room was located at the far end of the hall away from the elevators so there was no pedestrian traffic, making this a quieter location. Although we were not in a harbour view room, the hotel is in a U-shape which did result in us having a partial view of the harbour and Hong Kong Island on the other side. Sheraton Hotels feature the \"sleep comfort bed\" which is one of the most comfortable I have experienced anywhere. The bed was also equipped with two different kinds of pillows and there are apparently more types of pillows available for the asking. I rarely sleep for more than 4 hours but here I got up to 9 hours some nights. Aside from breakfast we ate at two of the hotel's restaurants. We were unimpressed with the Japanese restaurant on the 3rd floor, but the Oyster and Wine bar on the 18th floor provided us with a memorable meal. Location-wise the hotel is located right in the heart of the shopping district. It's an easy walk to the subway, bus, star ferry and Macau ferry.

There are so many hotels in the city that once you find a nice clean comfy one it\u2019s usually best to stick to it. Location is of course perfect. Sheraton is located on Kowloon side, right on the southern tip along Nathan Road, the main commercial hub of mainland Hong Kong. Subway station is one minute away, good for shopping and having a walk, full of shopping malls and department stores just facing the hotel and, last but not least, being opposite the island you get stunning views of the skyline. The hotel will not disappoint you. Service is perfect and everyone is of assistance. Separate check-ins and check-outs to speed up the process. I had an executive suite on Starwood Preferred Guest floor. The room was spacious, with two bathrooms and small living room with a desk/computer area. From the decor you could guess the room was not the newest but it was very clean and spacious. I had previously stayed here in standard rooms as well and they were clean and spacious enough too. Sheraton\u2019s Sweet Sleeper bed is always a garantee!!! Complimentary fruit is available all day long on all floors outside the elevators area. The hotel has of course a gym and a spa.

I haven\u2019t tried the restaurants inside the hotel as we like generally to explore the cities and experience local food so I cannot tell. Breakfast is on the hand very good. There is anything you can wish for. From Asian, to continental breakfast choice is wide. If you don\u2019t want to spend 24 euros each for breakfast just go out. Along Nathan road you will find several bars and coffee shops where you can have breakfast at very cheaper prices. And if you need to go to Hong Kong island, I don\u2019t recommend taking a taxi. With a taxi you need to take the tunnel and it takes in the morning even 35 / 40 minutes due to traffic. It is so much better to take star ferry. Star Ferry terminal is just beside the hotel, 5 minutes on foot . With just 5 dollars you cross to the other side and you get to see the skyline at the same time.

But if you are used to staying 5 star hotels , you will definately hate this hotel. LOCATION: Hotel has a very good location, it is on Nathan road which full of restaurants, shops etc. VIEW :If you didnt see the other hotel views at this area, you might think it has good views. If you look straight , it is open view to harbour but if you look right and left and down there are buildings. If you are high floors , you might have better view than lower floors. We were on the 17th floor, but we werent impressed with the view. ROOM: We stayed at the Tower section of the hotel thinking the rooms in that section will be much better quality and better views. When I read the bad reviews, before we made the reservation, I thought maybe those people staying at the regular section not the Tower. Tower rooms were so bad, I can not imagine how the regular rooms are. Everything in the room looks old, carpeting so old and looks dirty, you don't want to walk without shoes or slippers. Bed was so uncompartable and more like a quien size .Bathroom was SO small, sink was very small. Sheets and towels were clean. BREAKFAST: Since we were in a Tower room , we had the option for eating at the 18th floor or lobby area main restaurant.18th floor had smaller buffee with a quiter ambiance. Main restaurant had better buffee with more choices, not the best breakfast , but it was ok. Only way to describe this hotel is so you can understand \"Days Inn with the Harbour view\" or cheap Las Vegas Hotel. As I mentioned before If you stay at 2,3 star hotels , this hotel is great because at least it has some view and good location. But If you like to stay at 5 star hotels like Peninsula, Kempinsky , Four Seasons this is not a hotel for you.

We didn't get an oyster card, but you can use them everywhere so it might be good to get - unfortunately i think you need to use cash to purchase it, hong kong seems very much a cash society Sheraton breakfast: Loved the buffet breakfast, smoothies, fruit, all sorts of bready things, cheese, cereal, juices, dim sum, smoked salmon and cold meats, milks and yoghurts, eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, sausage, bread pudding, waffles, French toast, usually an Indian dish (daal, Chana masala), salad and probably more. You definitely will find something you'll eat. They change it up a bit from day to day but most of it stays the same. Great location - but honestly all the western hotels are within spitting distance of each other. The bar are restaurants are pricey! We thought about the oyster bar but we can pay the same or less at home for 4-5 star restaurants. We went for drinks and I had a virgin something and it was $100, husband had a beer at $50. Pool and hot tubs are on the roof with the fitness centre. Three \"Luke warm\" tubs and a pool. Not really a view unless you consider the flashing lights of the canon building a view. The bar has a great view as do all the restaurants upstairs. Standard room, standard bathroom (ie king bed, marble bath, desk, sofa, not a ton of room but a decent size - ie there is enough floor space to walk but the room is full) We didn't have a view and I think most rooms don't simply because there are buildings in front. The intercontinental obscures some of the view from the restaurant so I have to assume lower down would be worse. We were looking into the courtyard so perhaps you have to pay for a water view and you definitely need to be on a high floor. From the bar upstairs you can see the water but the intercontinental blocks some of it - so i'm not sure what the floors below the bar can see. There seemed to be a Sheraton link in the lobby, didn't try it since had Internet already. Other note - the curtains here were complete blackout curtains, not sure why this was so noticeable but this is probably the first hotel i have not actually known if it was day or night with the curtains drawn The room was also quiet expect for the water pipes, i seem to remember the water turning on and off for other rooms.

We didn't even have enough room for all of our things. There was no mirror on the wall but instead had clear glass that enabled one to see through to the bedroom and also outside. This took care of the problem of being too dark that the other room had. A partial mirror on the side would swing out for use. A shade was available to close for privacy if needed. This bath had a separate shower whereas the first one had a tub/shower combo. Room also included the same mini-fridge, flat screen TV, but only came with 2 small bottles of water (vs. 4 large in the first one). Puzzling difference. The staff is very efficient, polite, and helpful. Never had a problem with anyone. Food in the buffet restaurant is very good with great service. Decor at this hotel is somewhat dated but the premises are extremely clean. Location is fantastic being at the foot of Nathan Rd. Great shopping nearby as well as many restaurants.

Not much good to say about the Fitness First personal trainers. Gym is small, but well equipped. Rooms are small - but so are most of the older HK hotels - Kowloon side.

Budget hotel charging 4-star prices\u201d", "Author": "LovetheOrient", "ReviewID": "UR117000816", "Content": "We always tend to stay at higher end hotels on our vacations, but on this one occasion, Sheraton was the only option we had on our stay in HK. We have a 5 and 3 year old, and most other high-end hotels required us to book 2 rooms (weird rule, but we had no choice). This was the only half-decent hotel allowing us to stay in one room. Well, not sure where to start with my rant. First the positives (rather, the ONLY positive): - Service - quality of service offered by the staff is impeccable. Very friendly, responsive, follow up nicely on requests, and overall very welcoming. That's where the good ends. Now for my rant: - Room size - ridiculously small. Just to give you an example, we ordered in-room dining one night. The waiter was unable to fit the table between the bed and the TV. Eventually he just kept everything on the study desk and split. With two suitcases taking up the space on one side of the bed, we were basically jumping over stuff just to get to the bathroom. Horrendous! - Restaurant - The Cafe restaurant serves buffet breakfast and lunch (and I think dinner too). The spread was decent, fairly standard. But the waiting line spread all the way across from outside the restaurant, across the entire reception desk, to the elevators (on all 3 days when we were there). We seriously thought that there was a Black Friday sale going on inside. One of the morning, we basically had to go out for breakfast because our kids were starving and couldn't wait. It looks like these guys do brisk travel-agent bookings, and are unable to handle the demand. Increase the number of tables for cryin out loud!! - Our older son developed a rash from a mosquito bite in the room. We asked for an in-house doctor, they said it would cost HK$1800. When I lost it and said that they should offer it for free since they had mosquitoes in the room, they said our other option was to go to the doctor ourselves (next block) and he would charge HK$400 there. The doctor later told us that his fee was the same at the clinic as it was at hte hotel (HK$400). So I guess the hotel wanted to pocket the HK$1400 themselves. Nice way of doing business - first infect your rooms with bugs, then charge customers for getting treated. I can go on and on about how ridiculous and Motel-6 like this hotel is. Bottomline, if you are on a budget and have absolutely no other choice, give this a try. Otherwise there are better hotels in the vicinity that would offer better service.

I wished the toilet roll holder was much higher and nearer. You would have to keep bending down and reach out for your toilet paper. b. I felt that security should be tighter, normally hotels would allow free access from the first lower levels to the common shared facilities but once it got to the rooms, it would only be accessed by your hotel room card slotted/tapped in the lift. c.

I was surprised with a stay at the Sheraton in TST with a Harbour view room. You can see the lights from the evening light show every night - and you can turn up your hotel room's radio to have the accompanying music playing. On New Years Day, the hotel staff did a great job keeping the general crowd out of the hotel and we kept going downstairs to let our friends into our room for a celebration. I was relieved not to be crushed in the crowds below. The room was spacious for Hong Kong standards and the glassy view into the bathroom from the bedroom was odd but there was a privacy blind available. The bed was comfy though turndown service was inconsistent and disappointing - considering how much was spent on the room. The hotel is within walking distance to a Watson's Wine Cellar (for champagne, wine), a convenience store (7-Eleven?) - and other fast food chains. There are also several attractions nearby. The bad thing is that it's quite a walk (15 mins) from the nearest MTR station and it's near the Chungking Mansions - walk up Nathan road and you'll be hassled by multiple people for suits and other services - ignore them, look forward and keep walking. The hotel gym had a lovely view of the harbour with its own personalized televisions. It's manned by an attendant and had amenities like water and towels. The hotel Oyster bar was packed with people at night - which was unable to hold our large party but they offered the wine room instead. Multiple requests for champagne flutes for our room were delivered in a reasonable amount of time. Checkout was efficient and staff were friendly.

The hotel itself... Staff from front desk to housekeeping were courteous and friendly. Only a short wait for check-in and check-out. My partial harbourview room was spacious and comfortable and though the bathroom can fit two people, it's really meant for one. There were more international channels on the television than I get at home. The mini fridge was a bit small and I had to empty it to fill with my own food and beverages (I hope housekeeping didn't think that I consumed anything from their mini bar). The free bathroom amenities like shampoo and lotion weren't of the greatest quality. Free wifi internet is available only in the lobby which is an annoyance when you want to get work done in the quiet privacy of your room but can't. Dinner buffet at The Cafe was quite disappointing. The maitre d' sold it pretty well saying that there's a large focus on fresh seafood, but when I returned that Sunday night only five tables were occupied from 6 pm to 8 pm and the only seafood available was steamed fish and some four choices of sushi. The workout gym is small and feels crowded if there's more than 6 people, but the rooftop pool is fantastic and one of my favourites in Asia. A dozen lounge chairs are available as well as two whirlpools with a fantastic view of Victoria Harbour and a great place to relax after a long day. However, unless you can find a deal the Sheraton is pretty expensive per night. Sheraton hotels, at all of them that I've stayed in in Canada and Asia, have an \"American\" feel to them if that makes sense. The location... Very easy to get to from the airport by Airport Express and the Airport Express Shuttle Bus. It's about five minutes door to door from your hotel room to the MTR platform at Tsim Sha Tsui. You can be door to door to Mong Kok in 10 minutes, Central in 15 and Causeway Bay in 23-25. Three supermarkets, a dozen restaurants, three pharmacies and dozens of shops are within a 7-8 walk. Star Ferry is about a 12-15 minute walk away. Final comments... The concierges here are great and very knowledgeable.

In HKG space is at a premium and unless you are shelling out $600+USD per night you are going to have a smallish room by American standards. By European standards the room size is fine usually between 28-35 sq meters. The beauty of this hotel is that it is perfectly located at the bottom of Nathan Road so you can take a train or the Star ferry over to Central or walk almost anywhere on the kowloon side. The next door neighbor across Nathan Road is the Peninsula and across the street is the intercontinental Harbour front. and the Sheraton has the same view! This trip we paid about $300 for a deluxe larger size harbour view room. The view constantly took our breath away. If you are someone who likes to look at water, get one of these rooms and watch the world sail by. The rooms are showing their age, but beds were good, flat screen tv's installed and internet connectivity was available everywhere. Bathrooms are marble...some have a shower tub combo some are separate. Breakfast was included and we enjoyed a great buffet every morning and all our special requests were met, expresso's cappucinos. There was a manager lady Eva who called us by name every morning and was SO on top of things that I must say she and her staff provided some of the better service we have had in HKG. When she was off for one day, it was immediately evident. As far as HKG hotels go, this hotel strikes a nice balance of form and function as well as a beautiful view.

We stayed for 6 nights and would have happily stayed longer. Firstly, the position of the hotel is brilliant, right at the tip of Nathan Road, next door to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station and a five minute walk from the Star Ferry. Secondly, the hotel commands spectacular views of the harbour across to Hong Kong Island - the very view you see in all the postcards! We were lucky enough to stay in a harbour view room on the 15th floor and I would highly recommend reserving one of these rooms if possible. We paid a bit extra to have access to the Towers facilities (this is the term the hotel uses for their executive club) and I think is what made our stay so special. The Towers breakfast in the Oyster Bar (on the 18th floor overlooking the harbour) was wonderful and the afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapes in the club lounge were a real treat. The only negative here was that the lounge is quite small and there were times when we couldn't find a seat. The hotel might want to look at this and consider how to cope with overflow on busy days. As Towers guests we were also entitled to a HK$100 laundry allowance per person per day - enough to have one pair of shorts and a t-shirt washed - a real bonus. The room was not huge but big enough and very comfortable with all the amenities you could ask for. The bathroom was gorgeous and spacious with two sinks, a big bath, a large rainwater shower and a window which allowed you to look out to the view from the bathroom! The staff were all very polite, some less friendly and personable than others, but all helpful and accommodating. We also made good use of the rooftop pool which was terrific for cooling down after a hot, exhausting day of sightseeing.

Pleasant lobby, nice facilities and a really wonderful breakfast arcade (from miso soup to spanish omelettes. I stayed there two nights on the way to Guangzhou. I arrived at the Hong Kong airport at 5 a.m. and took a taxi to the hotel. The room (obviously) was not ready, so they let me go up to the sauna and shower and change clothes before I headed out to sight see. After a 15 hour flight from LAX, this was really appreciated. My room was a corner room on the ninth (SPG) floor. The view was okay, but if you want a view of the harbour, ask for one and ask for a higher floor. I was traveling on points, but colleagues who were SPG members and were paying got free breakfasts and a 100 Hong Kong dollar credit toward dry cleaning. The room was very modern and stylish and nicely appointed. The location is very nice--near the Star Ferry terminal and the Kowloon waterfront and near the bustling nightlife of Tsim Sha Tsui, Be sure to visit the nearby Kowloon park in the morning to watch the people practicing Tai Chi and especially if you are a birdwatcher. You are also only one MTR stop from the Temple Street Night Market. Two issues. They have a separate desk for SPG members but no separate line, which makes it difficult to use. You really seem like you are jumping line if you go to it and the others in line just glare at you. The other was the concierge, who didn't seem too informed. After being turned away from both the Pennisula Hotel restaurant and the Sheraton's rooftop restaurant because my female colleague was wearing sandals, we asked for alternatives. They really couldn't suggest anywhere we could go given my friend's \"Suzy Wong Shoes\" except the Ruth Chris steakhouse, which required (according to them) a taxi ride. So we went out on foot and went into the Shangra La Hotel and asked where we could get a meal. They were very helpful. Suggestion--Go to the rooftop hotel bar for a drink or afternoon tea. The view is fantastic! I would definitely stay there again! P.S. The entrances to the hotel are hard to find. There is an adjacent shopping arcade (The Elegance at the Sheraton) which is very mazelike and it is ver difficult to find your way to the hotel lobby from that shopping mall.

Since this was my R&R days, I wanted a room with a good view of HK harbor. That was the main reason that I choose this hotel among its competitors. The location couldn't be better for Nathan Road, the malls as well as it view of the harbor - facing the HK convention center. I booked a deluxe harbor-view room as I was concerned that the regular rooms might be a little small. With the AAA discount, it was somewhat cheaper than their competitors. I was quite happy with the room size, it didn't feel cramped at all - besides the bed, there was a glass office desk, a comfy upholstery chair, a console on which the flat-panel TV and mini-bar were located. The room decor is modern and updated. The bed was comfortable with nice down comforters. The bathroom is done is creme-colored marble and very cool see-through glass counter-top & sink. Also unique was there were 2 sinks/wash-basins instead of just one - a little strange as the bathroom was not jumbo-sized. Being trendy, there's a see-through window from the bathroom so you can see the harbor view in the bedroom window. The shower is just adjacent to the bathtub without partition. One negative was that internet wasn't part of my room fee. Adjacent to the work desk were some video connector ports - I didn't spend the time to figure out what they were for - perhaps hooking up your computer to the TV? I was upgraded to the SPG preferred Guest floor - the benefits are 1) some apples that are placed by the elevators 2) more important to most people - free mini-bottles of liquor outside the mini-bar 3) a free guidebook to HK dining. I was pretty happy with the harbor view from my room. The museums across Salisbury Road block the view slightly, but those building are also interesting architecturally. The front desk and concierge people were very helpful and professional so no complaints there. As expected, the staff's English is excellent. Most of the time, the lobby is subdued and relatively empty of people - very calming after walking around TST. Some minor nits about the house-keeping though: a) the glass wall & doors in the shower weren't spotless, rather they were cloudy from hard-water build-up. Otherwise, the room was very clean. b) When I arrived there were a couple of complimentary bottles of drinking water on the night stands. At some later time, these bottles were removed - strange. I had to call house-keeping to get them back. c) I had some laundry done, but it didn't return by the stated time. It was late by a few hours. I ate at the \"Cafe\" buffet restaurant. Be warned - this is very popular and CROWDED. Especially at breakfast, when it can seem like a college cafeteria. The food quality is good, especially for dinner - where I was especially happy with the food items. Besides the regular business center, there are 5 computers & 1 printer for free use in the lobby - very nice. There's a top-floor lounge and roof-top pool, but I didn't have a chance to use these. Despite minor quibbles, overall I was quite happy with my choice. Compared to its more luxurious (and much more expensive) competitors, I think this Sheraton is a good choice for quality & value. I would say it's a very strong 4-star offering, bordering on 5-star if they can fix the house-keeping issues I mentioned. If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars overall rating.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beaverton, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service & Excellent Quality--We Will Come Back !!\u201d", "Author": "ozaer_shah", "ReviewID": "UR65903119", "Content": "Id like to start by saying our stay at this property was not only encouraging, but has left us a lifetime memory..thanks to the wonderful positive professional staff that run this hotel. We booked this room using Starwood points and upon arrival, the desk agent encouraged us to upgrade to the towers room--and I must say, the best decision I made...well worth the extra $300 we paid for the 2 nights/ 3 days we were in HK. Our room included an incredible view of the harbor, which cannot be surpassed for the price. This upgrade enabled us to enjoy an afternoon tea with delicious scones--soft drinks, munchies, etc. Also after the high tea from 230-430PM, an evening Hors d'\u0153uvre session which started from 530PM-730PM offering an array of delicious 'happy hour' treats, which also included free drinks, and a chance to view the harbor light show while enjoying a cocktail drink (cappuccinos for us) The upgrade also included $100HKD free daily allowance for laundry (which was enough to clean 1 dress shirt), 20% meals/food items from the restaurant, free internet in the room (very useful)...otherwise you can go the lobby (not so convenient). The towers upg also has their own breakfast spread on the top floor. A very delicious spread with a great view of the harbor. There was not anything that you couldn't have within reason. The waiters took care of you at every angle--everything from seating you, to getting your toast, making sure your cup of coffee was filled and hot. Unbelievable service. An excellent upper floor exercise facility which we used early in the morning--felt like our own gym since no one was there at 6AM. Once again, everything you needed was there---all you needed was shorts and tennis shoes--the rest they took care of. Amenities in the room included a toothbrush, comb, lotions galore, shampoo/conditioner(s), comfy slippers and robes, office supplies. There was one asst. mgr by the name of \"Angela\" who was just phenomenal.....she taught us every trick in getting to where we wanted to go on the MTR and the best places to score bargain deals.....She was also great company to chat about the local scene and Hong Kong. This Starwood hotel has some really good SPG point redemption values--for instance, for 6500 pts, we were able to take back a Mercedes Benz to the airport from the hotel. That saved us a lot of time and also $260HKD.....but it was the time factor that was most important, as the car service was right there, and it was a Mercedes..very comfortable. The driver even offered us bottled water for the trip to the airport. This hotel took care of us at every angle and because of that service, we will not only return to Hong Kong to see the sights, but our stay at the Sheraton will be the second reason to return.

The rooms are well appointed, nicely furnished and large by HK standards. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the rooms were made up promptly each day. Turn down service was a little hit and miss however with the style and the extent of the turn down variyng a little depending on who was on duty. It is only a small detail, but one that detracts from the otherwise perfect service. The location is very convenient and most points in Hong Kong can be reached within 30 minutes at any time of the day. Hung Hom train station is about a $15 cab ride, HKG is ~$220 HKD with tolls and the bargain of the century Star Ferry is only a 10 minute walk from the front door of the hotel. The entrance to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station is only about 200 feet from the side door of the hotel. As a business traveller I was almost always upgraded to the executive suites, which IMHO rank amongst the best in class. Since this was a leisure trip, I asked for a harbour view suite because the executive suites only have a courtyard view. I was told that harbour view suites were not offered as an upgrade, but I could have either a deluxe harbour view room, or for a small premium I could buy an upgrade to the harbour view suite. I elected to pay the upgrade because it was my wife's first trip to Hong Kong. When I walked into the suite, I was initally pleased with the lay out and size, but when I opened the curtains to look at the view, I was extremely disappointed. The view in the center of the floors between rooms ending in 35-45 was much better than the suites which were at the end of the halls. A quick phone call to the front desk and the very gracious staff, moved me to a room with a better view without hesitation. Of course the room rate was adjusted without question as well. At the end of our stay, I went to check out and found that there were several long queues at the front desk. One of the assistant front desk managers saw my SPG Platinum folder in my hand and he approached me discretly, led me to a closed position at the far end of the front desk and expedited my checkout personally. Instead of 15 minutes or more standing in line, I was on my way in less than 10 minutes total. The only weakness in the service offering was at the concierge desk. While the service was adequate the concierge desk was manned by relatively inexperienced staff who seemed to have a limited amount of knowledge on area amenities and restaurants. Since I am reasonably familiar with Hong Kong the shortcoming was not a problem, but for a Hong Kong newbie, some of the recommendations were cruise ship quality at a premium price. I would defintely get a second opinion before you surrender yourself to the concierges here.

The room was booked online at the SPG site and it was 1400 Hong Kong Dollar (approx. about 170 USD). I chose the Sheraton as I\u2019m Starwood preferred guest and as it was located in the same area that I stayed in the last time I was on HK\u2026at Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon. I got to the hotel by taking the airport express train into the Kowloon station (costing 90 HKD) and from there I took a taxi to the hotel and it was only like 5-10 minutes and cost 35 HKD (4.5 USD). When I checked in I had a weak moment so I decided to upgrade to Club level as it would give me breakfast, access to the club lounge, Internet etc. Check in was efficient and as my room was not ready I was sent to the lounge on the 16th floor while my room 1771 was being prepared. What a view there is from the lounge on the 16th floor \u2013 you get a great view of the harbor area and the skyline of Hong Kong. My room was very nice indeed. There was a combination of tiles and carpet on the floor and the walls were a combination of light wall paper and darker wood panels. I got a king size bed with lots and lots of pillows but the bed was not as soft I would have liked it to be. In front of the bed was a huge Samsung flat screen TV with lots of channels and this was also connected to the work desk area which was pretty well set up. As I stayed at Club level I had free WiFi but for some reason I did have problem connecting to it from time to time. Apart from this I had a chair where I could sit to check out the great view from the window \u2013 the view was of the harbor and the space museum. The minibar included a couple of bottles of complimentary water. The minibar also contained a lot of things that were priced the same as 7-Eleven + 10%. So a can of Coke was only 6.4 HKD (about 0.8 USD) and that makes more sense compared to some hotels where you have to pay astronomical prices for the soft drinks. The safe was large enough to store my laptop which is a nice feature. On the small table next the bed there was a cool little gadget\u2026a docking station for the iPhone/iPod with speakers combined with a wake up function of course. The only problem was that the display with the watch on it was quite bright so it lid up half of the room at night. Talking about lights\u2026is there no master switch in the rooms? I kept on looking for this but in the end I had to turn off all the lights individually. The bathroom was tiled and contained a beautiful glass sink together with a bathtub and shower. The shower was tiny so in my opinion that should have just left out the bathtub and made the shower larger. The amenities were quite impressive\u2026.everything from dental floss, mouth wash, shaving kit, dental kit, sponges, shower caps and of course shampoo, conditioner and body gel. On the 17th floor you also have access to the health club where you can exercise and enjoy the view of Hong Kong skyline and the pool is located on the top floor outside. The pool is not huge or anything but OK for a dip after a day of sightseeing. I had a massage and it was 600 HKD for 1 hour. The only problem was that the lady that gave me the massage kept on bugging me about going for a different kind of massage, to go for 1 \u00bd hour instead of just 1 hour etc. If you are staying at the Club level you can either have the breakfast on the 18th floor in quiet surroundings or have it downstairs in a caf\u00e9. I tried both and the selection is more extensive downstairs \u2013 there was a good selection of eggs, bacon, sausages, pastries etc. Well, they basically had all that you need from a hotel breakfast in my opinion. Located in Tsim Sha Tsui you can easily walk to the Tsim Sha Tsui subway station or to the Star ferry to go across to Hong Kong island so the location is pretty good.

You will walk in, there will be loads of pilots and US businessmen, and you'll quickly forget that you're in Hong Kong.

It is easy, the french toast is amazing, there are loads of options, and the buffett is never crowed. Room service is very courteous and they will remember your name if you order several times. ROOM: The shower is the drawback to the room. It is one of those stand-up showers where the glass covers 3/4 of the shower and exposes 1/4. You have to physically be in the shower to turn it on...which can bring a cold surprise if you're not prepared. The beds are very comfortable. The pillows are nice blend of soft/hard.

We could use the luggage trolley right to the platform of the train. From there we took at taxi the short distance to the hotel for the luggage we had. It was easy from the airport to arriving to the hotel. The porters at the hotel were waiting for each car that arrived and we were made to feel welcome from when we stepped from the vehicle. RECEPTION We had made the reservation with on the Starwood website direct and arrived to have only two items not as per the booking. Before check in we had to use the business centre facility to print out our booking pages to have as evidence that breakfast was included and late checkout was guaranteed for the price we paid. The friendly staff member at the reception desk apologised many times and said the items were never included, but on us presenting the paper work apologised more so that it was a promotion on Starwood website. This sorted out in fifteen minutes then we could check in and arrive to our room after our travelling. We had to contact reception after arriving to our room as the cot that was requested had not arrived, however within five minutes the staff had it there, again impressive service. On the day of departure there were five staff on duty and no queues, great efficiency and very polite manners. ROOM The deluxe room was of a good size for Hong Kong as other hotels we have stayed in have been much smaller. On entry to the left was the modern bathroom with a very good range of Green Tea amenities by the Sheraton brand. It was of marble and a glass vanity that had a interesting plug to use in the basin. To the right of the entry was the wardrobe, mini bar & fridge. Walking into the room was a desk area to the left, a couch sitting area to the right and the king bed in the far left corner. It was a Sweet Sleeper bed and very comfortable for us! It was very clean and could not fault the room or the cleanliness in any way. FACILITIES Breakfast was included in the room price and we had that each morning at The Cafe. On the first morning we arrived the staff had no record of our room having breakfast included and after a phone call they returned to advise it was. The buffet breakfast was excellent! The choice of juices, fruit, pastries, hot food etc was well worth the price if we had to pay for it! This was the only restaurant we used in the hotel \u2013 for lunch and dinner we went to nearby places of Kowloon. Internet free in the designated area across from reception and the cards are available from them too. We had no wait to use a terminal and the speed was fast of the internet. AREA The area is perfect to explore Kowloon and convenient to reach Hong Kong island by ferry or train. One of the hotel elevators gives access to the shopping centre that avoids external access. It was easy to commute to and from airport.

I spent a week here using my membership points. In fact, it's a fantastic place to cash in your points if you're planning a trip to Hong Kong. I think the best time to go to Hong Kong is around Chinese New Year. If you arrive a couple of days before, and stay a few days after, you'll end up seeing the city in a completely different light. It's less crowded with tourist at this time. The downside is limited stores and sites being open before, during, and two days after Chinese New Year. But there's a lot of celebration, and most of the restaurants are open, and all retail gets back to normal within 48 hours after the new year. Some of the rooms at the Sheraton have partial harbor views. I had one that overlooked the Harbor, and had a great view of the Chinese New Year parade from my window. It was impossible to see it on the streets with the heavy crowds. Nathan Road is a big shopping street, but I find it a little seedy. You'll find a lot of East Indian folks hanging around trying to sell you things like custom suits. Every single European or American was a target. Watch your bags/purses/wallets closely along Nathan Road. The MTR is a few blocks away, so it's all within walking distance. A couple of times I got back pretty late, and as a lone woman roaming Nathan Road can be a little uncomfortable. Here's a link to the streets around this hotel: http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/property/area/map.html?propertyID=482 Eating around here is a mixed bag. The hotel food was VERY high priced. I avoided ALL food from the restaurants. I did eat snacks from the mini bar, which was having some strange sale, so I got beer and chips for the same price as the 7-11 which is only across the street from the hotel. This is a great place to get snacks (hot and cold), and a reliable resource for me. The 7-11 is on the street perpendicular to Nathan Road but right across from the hotel. I don't remember the name. I also ate a lot of my meals at Cafe Coral, which is on Nathan Road about two blocks from the hotel. It's upstairs on the same floor as the Salsa Cosmetic Shop. (Which is a great place to pick up inexpensive cosmetics, particularly neat stuff from Japan that you can't find in the US. I recommend going there if you're in make-up and perfume.) There are also small mom and pop shops up there selling local Hong Kong goods. I did order the American Breakfast once, and there was so much food that it could feed two hungry people. I recommend this during the early mornings or your first day, because you'll probably be up too early to go out for breakfast. For US $30 for breakfast, it's hefty for one person, but perfect for two people. The room I had at the Sheraton was smallish, but for one person, it was just fine. The bathroom was also smallish, but I was fine. You just have to learn to adjust to the size. My room had a small couch which gave me a little more room to spread out. The bed was comfortable and linens were fine. There was a coffee/tea service in the room, and huge plus for me while adjusting my jet lag. Internet is free at 30 minutes a pop downstairs at the lounge. You have to get a pin/access number from the concierge. I used this service for most of the days because I only needed to check on the occasional email. I used the gym, and it was fine. It also had a nice view and all the equipment was clean and new. This is something you can do while you're waiting for the rest of the city to wake up. I still like the Langham MongKok better (see my review on that hotel) if I had to pay for my room. But if you prefer to be in town and having an easy reach to the Star Ferry, then this perfect. The Sheraton is right across from the Peninsula Hotel, without the Peninsula prices. It's smack near all the local museums as well. My favorite museum is the Hong Kong History Museum...I recommend that over the space/science museum especially if this is your first trip to Hong Kong. But the Langham MongKok is VERY self-contained inside of a mall, and the eating choices are local and delicious. You get a better taste of Hong Kong in MongKok because it's more \"local\" but you need to be more adventurous to stay there. I find the MTR much more convenient as well in MongKok. I speak the language, and I blend in, so my views are less touristy. You will have no problem staying at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers, it's just looking for reasonably priced food that can be problematic.

The Sheraton was picked because it was a superior class hotel, and the Eton was picked because it was a good class hotel at a much lesser price to spend the rest of the holiday. Our room at the Sheraton overlooked the harbour and the Hong Kong skyline, which was amazing, particularly at night time when the firework show was on. The room was very modern, with a curved glass desk, nice furnishings and high quality cotton bed covers making it really comfortable to stay in. The only downside was the rather odd 'glass wall' of the bathroom, which means that unless you turn down the blinds, the other occupants of the bedroom can see exactly what you're doing. Not so bad if all you're doing is taking a shower, and the other person in the room is used to seeing your body, but not so great when you just want to take a quick trip to the loo. Apparently, the reason this is done is because you get the amazing Hong Kong skyline views from your bathroom because of the glass wall. Nice, but I don't go to the bathroom to spend hours gazing at a view, so not particularly a useful feature. That's my only downside, but as I say, you just keep the blinds shut and there's no problem. The rooftop pool is fairly small, with a few sunbeds and a spa, but is a great retreat from this bustling city. There's no bar up there so you need to take your own refreshments. The hotel is centrally located, and close to the ferries to hop on to the nearby beautiful islands. Lantau Island is particularly beautiful with the giant buddha statue and the Po Lin Monastery. The monks serve up a mean vegan lunch menu. I would definitely recommend the Sheraton as a good quality, central hotel in Hong Kong.

We arrived around 9am and had no problems checking in early to our room and just in time for breakfast. Room \u2013 Our room 810 was a deluxe harbour view room located on the Starwood Executive Floor.

Tea/ coffee facilities/ TV/ working desk and broadband internet connection. Bathroom \u2013 My husband absolutely loved the bathroom, the vanity unit had two bowls and was made all from glass, so the bathroom was chic and modern with a walk-in shower and a large bath. Restaurants \u2013 The best thing about this hotel is the breakfast. It has an amazing selection of food from Chinese to European to Western. You do however have to do some serious walking afterwards as the brekkie can last you for the whole day. The Celestrial Court Chinese Restaurant is excellent but a little pricey. Upstairs on the 17th floor is the Sky Lounge which has amazing views of the harbour and skyline. At 8pm one can watch the light show which lasts for approx 30minutes. So make sure you book a window table and enjoy a cocktail. The Sky Restaurant which is next door to the lounge is a fine dining restaurant serving contemporary modern cuisine, its expensive however the food is excellent. Facilities \u2013 A terrific health club on the top floor with first-rate equipment. The outdoor swimming pool is small but its comfortable with plenty of deck chairs available. Overall \u2013 We loved the Art Deco building and its very comfortable rooms and the position is excellent. It\u2019s a delightful hotel offering fantastic food and facilities.

It's location is along the waterfront right at the foot of the famous Nathan Road and within walking distance to all the shopping in Kowloon. Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station is about a 5-10 minute walk away, Granville Road and its shops are 10 minutes away and if you're up for some exercise, the Temple Street night market is about 15-20 minutes away though you could also take the MTR a few stops to save some time and rest the legs. Avenue of the Stars and the harbour are also just steps away but as of September 2008 there's road construction in the area so you'll have to take the underground pathway/mall. My room on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor (half the floors are SPG floors) was large and spacious with the Sheraton's signature bed and pillows (which were too soft for my tastes but that's a personal preference), couch (which doubled as a bench for my suitcase), TV (CRT, not LCD) with about two dozen English channels available and a gorgeous bathroom. I had a courtyard view (it's better to just keep the drapes closed) but at check-in was offered the option of upgrading to a harbour view suite for 450 HKD which I declined. The rooftop pool and sauna never felt crowded and also offers a westward view of Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong Island. Views to the south and east are blocked by the south tower. The cardio and weight room is rather small (but with a great view of Victoria Harbour same as the pool) and I think with more than maybe 10-12 people would feel crowded. A separate warmup/yoga room also sits next to it. Access to the internet is freely available to guests either by ethernet to your laptop, wifi in the lobby or with the half dozen PCs available for use also in the lobby. We also made use of the concierge/guest services who answered all our questions and gave us recommendations on everything from how to get to the hotel from the airport using the quickest and least expensive route, local stores and shopping, which MRT routes to take, various costs of attractions and pretty much anything we could think of. With the concierge we didn't even need to use the internet to look anything up and perfect English was spoken by everyone we encountered there. Even the wait staff and housekeeping would always acknowledge and greet us in the hallways. Both a la carte and buffet are available at The Cafe in the lobby for breakfast, lunch or dinner, but know that coffee/tea isn't included in breakfast (unless you get the buffet) and you'll be charged for it. What's strange about this is that just outside The Cafe is free coffee/tea available for guests so hold off on your caffeine fix under after you're done eating. With the buffet there's a wide selection of American, continental and Chinese as well as fresh fruits. I would recommend this for your morning carbs and protein to kickstart your day as the a la carte selection, while better, doesn't really offer a satisfying plate for the money I found. The dinner buffet at The Cafe is one of the best I've ever had in my life with a wide selection of sushi, Chinese stir-fries, roasts and seafood. I gorged myself on sashimi and softshell crab. It's about 45-60 minutes to or from the airport by the Airport Express line and free shuttle bus with the cost being 90 HKD to/from Kowloon station.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Location\u201d", "Author": "PAQ", "ReviewID": "UR20811871", "Content": "As a Platinum Starwood Preferred Guest, I tend to stay at lots of Sheratons.

The TST subway stop is right there, the Star Ferry is about a 10 minute walk away and the Sheraton is on Nathan Rd. 2. The workout facility is on one of the top floors and has the most amazing views of the HK Harbor. The gym equipment is new and kept very clean. 3. The toiletries in the room were by Etro (upscale Italian line) and were plentiful. 4. The room was small but well appointed with good reading lights, TV, fax machine, etc.. CONS 1. The hotel's decor is an 80's style and seems dated and vaguely depressing. There is lots of shiny brass, dark blue carpeting, low ceilings, etc... If you see their dining room on the top floor, you will know what I mean. 2. I specifically requested a non-smoking room and somehow got put on a smoking floor. (You can see in the elevator which floors are designated as non-smoking.) Our hallway noticeably smelled like stale cigarette smoke although our room smelled ok. 3. The concierge lady in the Exec. Level lounge was rude and unhelpful. I logged onto the free terminal to check in for my flight and then noticed that there was no printer on which to print my boarding pass. I asked if I could print the pass to her printer sitting on her desk. She curtly told me no and to go to the Business Center (18 floors away) if I needed to do that. In addition to not being happy about her attitude, I think that it is pretty common nowadays for travelers to want to print out their Boarding Pass and the Sheraton's Executive Level lounge should be equipped to handle this. 4. The Bell Captain Desk pretended not to know the times for the Airport Shuttle Bus, I guess so we'd have to take a taxi to the Kowloon Airport Shuttle Rail Station (and therefore grease the wheels of the Sheraton bellmen/taxi guys relationship). I am pretty sure that there is a schedule for the Airport Shuttle Bus Stop next to the Sheraton. We stayed at the JW Marriott in HK a week before in our trip and they knew the times of their bus stop schedule. Just sayin'. 5. This is not the hotel's fault but directly outside the doors on Nathan Rd. are a multitude of Indian men aggressively hawking you to come with them to see \"copy watches\", purses, DVD's etc... Some men even tugged on our shirtsleeves and followed us down the street. It was irritating and made the general area near the Sheraton seem downmarket, cheap and tacky. We did not experience this kind of behavior over in Central (other side of Harbor). All in all, it was a \"free stay\" so I really should not complain but if I had paid to stay at the HK Sheraton, I would be a little annoyed. It would not have been good value for money.

Hitting the highlights, from the Sheraton, which is in Kowloon, we walked to McDonalds for breakfast (we have a 7 year old) and then to the ferry terminal (15 minute walk) and took the ferry to Hong Kong Island. The ferry costs about .50 cents per adult and kids are even cheaper. Upon arrival on the other side, we walked our way to The Peak tram (they do not take credit cards for the tram); it's about $5 per adult and half for kids. Going to the top is a very worthwhile trip with unforgettable views of the city and the peninsula. You don't need to buy the special Sky Terrace pass, which is about $2 more; you won't be missing anything special. Although, having a small meal or drinks up at the restaurants look like they might be worthwhile since the views are spectacular from there. There's even a Burger King up there. At the top, there's a tourist help center that is helpful with directions for when you get back down. We asked for directions to \"the worlds longest moving walkway\" and once we got back down, took a one-way bus ride to find it. Can't remember what stop it was. Taking the walkway leads you to SoHo. It's kind of a tourist trap in terms of restaurants but we ended up eating at a local Italian place...pizza and pasta. After lunch, we walked back to the ferry stop and back to Kowloon. Once in Kowloon, we bought bus tickets to find our way to the \"Ladies shopping area\". It's depicted on the tour maps. Basically, it's outdoor shopping with over a 100 vendors. You must bargain there. If it's Made in China, you can find it there. Afterwards, we took a bus back to the Sheraton for a quick break and then in the evening, went back out to the \"men's shopping\" area. It's similar to the ladies market. We walked there via the Kowloon park (very nice park in the middle of the city---incredible pool). The men's shopping is about half way between the hotel and the ladies shopping. In the evening at 8 pm, the highrises do a light show that you can see from the top of the Sheraton or from the harbour across the street. We chose to go out and see it from the harbour. It's literally right across the street. The lightshow sounds better on paper than it actually is (they really could have made it so much more), but the skyline of Hong Kong Island is really something to see, at night. Going back to the airport, you can take bus A21 across the street and about a block from the hotel. it takes one hour and is about $2 per adult.

Used tour desk in the lobby to book a day trip and very efficient. Front desk staff courteous but not over the top.

For myself, the biggest pro is the gym and pool on the roof. At most hotels, this would have an additional charge, but at this hotel it's included in the hotel rate which is great because it's a nice gym and just having a pool in HK is a luxury. The location is great for those that want to shop and visit museums. I only have a couple of cons. The internet at this hotel wasn't that great. I found that WIFI in asia isn't the best, but I expected the Sheraton to be a little better. Of course price could also be better and when compared to other hotels, I think the Sheraton is a little over priced.

My friend told me we got lucky because he didn't always get this view during his many previous stay here. The room was smaller than your average hotel room size in the States, but I guess this is Hong Kong and space is limited so I guess you can say it's a good size considering.

We can't comment on the food at the hotel as we tend to prefer to venture out and try the local cuisine (Hotel food can be a bit 'safe' and westernised)... and as your in Hong Kong theres no shortage of delicious and cheap food around... If you've never tried 'everyday' chinese cuisine before (I'm not talking chicken in black bean sauce from Mr Wongs here) be adventurous, try something new, you'll be well rewarded.

ROOM We reserved the Deluxe Room without Harbour View since the Harbour View rooms were sold out during our stay. We tried repeatedly to get a Harbour View room, but were unsuccessful even after our arrival \u2013 They\u2019re quite popular and rightly so: Our room only had views of Nathan Road, The Peninsula Hotel and the other lower floors of our own hotel. The room itself was of moderate size with modern furnishing. There was a medium-sized television on an unusual TV stand (not an LCD TV), a writing desk with Internet access (not complimentary), a sofa and a large window. Since we are members of the STARWOOD Preferred Guest Program, we also received complimentary bottles of water and a newspaper daily (the room itself was on the STARWOOD Preferred Guest floor). The room was very bright and cheerful; I especially liked the dark brown colour motif! The bed was comfortable and the bed sheets were acceptable. The room was clean and also had tea-making facilities. BATHROOM The bathroom was semi-luxurious \u2013 A glass sink with a heated mirror and a nice purple orchid which slowly wilted away during our stay. The toilet was inside the bathroom and there was no separate shower cubicle. The no-name Sheraton branded amenities were all right and to be expected of a hotel of this calibre. The water pressure was surprisingly good! HOTEL FACILITIES/RESTAURANTS The hotel offered a fitness centre/spa and a pool, but we didn't use these facilities. There were numerous restaurants to choose from, but we didn\u2019t dine in the hotel. The lobby was quite nice \u2013 having recently gone through a renovation. There was a nifty machine, which could print most international newspapers for a small fee in the lobby. I tried to use it, but it was out of service. The Sky Lounge on the top floor of the hotel came highly recommended, but in the end we didn\u2019t get a chance to review it. SERVICE There was no service-related problems. The staff was courteous, although not always smiling. The only complaint I have is Starwood Hotels\u2019 tendency to use internationally unrecognised geographic names (i.e. \"Arabian\" Gulf as opposed to the correct \"Persian Gulf\") in their brochures/websites that can be insulting/politically insensitive to certain guests. SURROUNDINGS The hotel is right in the middle of Kowloon across from the Peninsula Hotel on Nathan Road. The Tsim Sha Tsui subway station is right outside the hotel and the Star Ferry terminals to Hong Kong Island is less than a ten minute walk away. Nathan Road features lots of shopping and dinning options and the Star Ferry Terminal is near the Harbour City shopping complex. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that in the evening, the Hong Kong Symphony of Lights (light show) is worth a look \u2013 Just cross the street from the Sheraton and walk towards the Tsim Sha Tsui East Promenade at around 8 PM for views of Hong Kong island and the Hong Kong evening light show. CONCLUSION Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel and Towers is a great hotel, and semi-luxuriously appointed. The location can\u2019t be beat and it offers value for money.

I am an SPG member, and used points to stay at the hotel for two nights, picking up the third night myself. I wasn't disappointed with my choice. Location: The hotel's location is one of it's best features - at the tip of Kowloon peninsula in the heart of Tsim Tsa Tsui. The hotel is right next to the MTR, and you can easily walk all over Kowloon (including up and down Nathan Road - \"The Golden Mile\" - and even to and fro the night market on Temple Street). There were tons of places to eat and drink in the neighborhood, plus great shopping and all the basic services (including banks, and a post office literally right across the street). The hotel is also right across the bay, with amazing views of the city from the rooftop and many rooms. If your room doesn't have a view, you can also cross the street and walk along the \"Avenue of Stars\" which is a must see for the incredible views, especially at night. The hotel is also very close to the Star Ferry, which is easily reached via the underground walkways near the hotel. In short, the location is hard to beat, and I strongly recommend Kowloon over Central for a tourist - Central is fun to walk around, but I liked TST and Kowloon better. The Room: I paid $30 a night to upgrade to a harbor view room (including for the nights that I used points for - so they weren't free after all), which was absolutely worth it. See my pictures above; this was one place where just staying in the room was an attraction all its own just because of the view. I was on the 11th floor, in a King-sized room. The room itself was relatively small, but for a solo traveller there was plenty of room for luggage, etc. The bathroom was very large, and had a few cool features such as a volume control for the TV, a glass panel looking into the room, and a separate shower/tub area. The only real downside was that the bed was a little hard, but that was just a minor issue. Amenities: I took advantage of the rooftop pool a couple of times to escape the heat (heat index of about 95F when I was there). The pool was a little smaller than it looked in the picture, but it was still very nice. If you sat on the side that faced the Peninsula Hotel, you had great views of the city. There was also a small bar/restaurant in the pool area, which offered wait service at your lounge chairs. There was a fitness facility on the same level, but I didn't end up using it. I didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants because I generally avoid hotel restaurants because it seems that they're usually overpriced, plus I'd rather eat HK food! One other nice amenity was that they had little internet kiosks where guests got 20 minutes free - but I always just asked for another access code when my time ran out, without any problems. This was good for me, because I had a hard time finding internet cafes in Hong Kong (although I later learned that free internet was available at Pacific Coffee Company). Service: Everyone was very friendly and polite, from the doormen to the bellmen to the reception staff. Conclusion: I'd absolutely stay here again. It is definitely on the spendier side, and I especially would have felt it more had I paid for all three nights. With that said, the views and incredible location are pretty hard to beat. Compared to the Peninsula and Intercontinental (both close by and offering similar views), this hotel is quite a bit cheaper, so in that sense, I think it's a decent value for the location. I should also point out that I booked the room (for the one night I wasn't using hotel points) on the Sheraton website, and the price decreased several times since. I just went back and checked every couple weeks, and when such decreases occurred, I just rebooked under the new rate. I'd recommend that for anyone who wants to stay at a nice hotel on a budget.

They standard of housekeeping was such they had to send the supervisor up to check daily (which co-incidentally only lasted a few days until more problems). The engineer had to come up to fix the drains as the bath from day 1 was overflowing, the toilet kept running, we had to have someone fix the safe as that too broke down. We reluctantly had to complain to guest relations, they were good, but reactive- can't wait to get you out the door. The concierge are great. Very helpful and polite. The restaurants in the place are also great. Would recommend the oyster bar- silver service without a glitch and outstanding food. We wouldn't stay in this hotel again.

Try a muffin and coffee from the lobby shop for a much more reasonable deal, or visit the nearby SOGO grocery store (in the subterranean mall) for fresh fruit and pastries and a much more interesting cultural experience. Except for the doormen at the taxi stand, service was generally apathetic. When we went to the Sky Lounge one evening for drinks (about 9:00 PM, long after the light show), the hostess immediately showed us the \"minimum charge\" per person section of the drink menu. Wow, nice way to say \"welcome\"!

There was everything you could think of, from a full English breakfast, to noodles, cheese and cold meats, danish pastries, fresh fruit, smoothies, freshly cooked omlettes and eggs etc. You could have virtually anything. The health club was also great. We had a swedish massage an hour before leaving for the airport to return home and it was work every penny of the \u00a342.

The room itself was fine, nice bed, nice bathroom with a bathtub for one rather than two. The room was smallish but nothing wrong. The Starwood Lounge on the 9th floor is hardly worth it, only fountain soft drinks during the day with some appetizers and alcohol between 3 and 6 in the afternoon. Nice touch is the roof pool on the 18th floor with three Jacuzzis with a good partial view of the harbor. Service was good everywhere although a bit slow in the breakfast restaurant. Great choice for breakfast but the hot food could be a bit hotter, the coffee a bit better and the service a bit more attentive. Location was good right next to the (much better) Peninsula.

We enjoyed the view of the harbour with its nightly light show during our stay there. The swimming pool wasn't as big as I hoped, small in comparision to other places I've stayed. They have three spa baths on their rooftop. However, I must say the location is the best, next to the MRT station (via KCR train entrance). I get my digital photos developed across the road at this photo store (near the 7 Eleven store) after my daily travels. Also the currency exchange booth (between 7 Eleven and Photo place) offered the best currency exchange rate in the area. You can get your money exchanged at the hotel, the rates aren't that bad either in comparision to some of the places around Nathan Road. The breakfast buffet bar was superb!!

We had the pleasure of viewing the 12 minutes laser show from our room ,and my 2 young kids enjoyed it , but better on the second night , where we walked across to the harbour and mingled with the crowd , and this time round together with the sound effects and ambience - SPECTACULAR ! The service is efficient and staffs are polite . Basically , there is no complain about their service. The room is very clean and modern.Great pillows , my 2 young kids slept throughout the nites . The baby crib that they provided for my 18 months old girl , even came with a little pillow and a nice feeling cotton blanket ,how thoughtful! And the crib was already inside my room , before i checked in ! Their internet connection is fast and just a phone call to the receiption and it is done with a fee of HKD120 per 24 hours - REASONABLE . But the marble floor at the shower point would be very slippery when wet , and there is like some blood stain on the floor of my room , it seemed like someone stayed before me has had a terrible fall and had bled a lot , the blood stains seemed to have sipped into the tiles , and couldn't be washed off . So my hubby and i were extra careful when stepping out of the bathtub , and i would carry my kids out , after they have their shower . Make use of their shampoos and bath gels , conditioner , lotion it has very nice lavendar smell and it comes in a generous tube package , unlike those that you find in normal 3-4 stars hotel . My husband and i ended up not using our own that we have brought along . I had my dinner at one of their Pub Restaurant at the basement , SOMEPLACE ELSE . Try out their chicken wings with their special sauce , very nice . Their seafood rice combo came at a hefty price of HKD260 (SGD56)and nothing special .

The odd thing is that the hotel allows you to use Starpoints to eat at these restaurants - not really fair The availability of Non news and Non Sport TV is also quite poor.

It's at the southern tip of Tsim Sha Tsui across from the Peninsula. It's a short walk to the Star ferry and the entrance to the MTR is right beside the hotel, by the KCR entrance. We arrived by taking the Airport Express and connecting via the free K2 shuttle bus to the side of the Sheraton. We got a deal on the price so it only costed 70 HKD/person/one way. I stayed here for 4 nights at an incredibly low rate of 1150 HKD/night, considering it was over New Year's. As a Platinum, they offered to put me up in a Harbour View room on the 15th Floor. I declined in favour of a suite which is about twice the size. A word of caution about suites with number xx64. There is an unexplainable \"thumping\" noise that emanates from the bedroom closet. When bringing it up with the front desk, they acknowledged that problem and offered to put me in a different suite. I declined since the other suite would be a purely city view. Also, as Platinum, I got access to the exec lounge and a free continental breakfast at The Cafe. You have to tell them you're getting the continental breakfast or they will charge you for the full breakfast. It wasn't bad since it included pastries, congee, smoked salmon, chicken, salad bar, juice, and a smoothie bar. The exec lounge is nothing to write home about but is open from 7 am to 11 pm for non-alcohol drinks. Canapes are from 5 pm to 8 pm which includes alcohol drinks such as beer, wine, and whiskey. The Sheraton has been renovated and the rooms are extremely modern in appearance. The bathrooms use the boutique hotel style sinks but I always think the water doesn't come out far enough. I had a strange configuration of a roman bath enclosed with the bathtub. The suites also come with a separate washroom and sink by the entrance. There's a very nice sitting lounge and great workstation space. In the sitting lounge, there is a DVD/CD player with the TV. The bedroom is just huge, for Hong Kong, and the beds are very nice. I'm not sure if they're the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper beds, though. When navigating the MTR, I strongly suggest you pick up an Octopus card. It costs 150 HKD which includes a refundable 50 HKD deposit and 100 HKD in refundable credits. That way, you don't have to carry bags of change in your pockets and navigate horrendous line-ups to buy tickets. We went to HK Disneyland which was cost about 18 HKD each way. What can I say about shopping? It's everywhere. Ignore the people selling suits or fake watches along Nathan road. Well, that's if you want to. Also ignore any \"duty free\" places since all of HK is duty free. The computer/electronic mecca is the Golden Computer Arcade mall by Sham Shui Po station. Good places within walking distance for dim sum include the Serenade restaurant in the HK Convention Centre (which has an excellent view of the harbour and discounts its dim sum if you arrive before noon) and Hei Chin Rou in the Langham hotel. There's a Morton's on the 4th floor of the Sheraton if you need a good steak fix. The service encountered in the hotel was very good.
