The first tip I'd give someone is to make certain your taxi driver knows where you are going. In the two weeks I stayed there I didn't find a single taxi driver who could find the place. Print a map of the area before you go and show it to the taxi driver. The hotel is in a largely residential area so if you want local culture, you got it. IT's a few blocks walk to anything, but if you can manage 10 minutes of walking you'll find great restaurants. I'll try to remember a few of them and post future reviews. The rooms are simple and on the small side but very clean and comfortable. I checked out a few of them during my stay and I would say that higher floors are better. I did get a chance to see one of the suites on the top floor as well. It was very nice but had no shower just a tub. The hotel restaurant serves a nice, basic breakfast. I'm mostly a \"Just Coffee\" kind of gal at breakfast so I didn't have much but others seemed pleased. There is no laundry service. Our two week stay challenged my clean wardrobe. I ended up buying a bucket and soap to do laundry in my room. I later picked up a fan to help dry things. Apparently there is no laundry service in Istanbul. None. This is what we were told by the hotel staff and by our business contacts in Istanbul. I see a business opportunity for someone. The hotel staff was pleasant and professional but if you want any actual help seek out the younger of the front desk staff. I have forgotten his name, but he has a bit of a birthmark on his face and you'll know him by his cool charm and friendliness. Overall, I'd say this place is a good deal and worth staying at.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amman, Jordan", "Title": "\u201cDo not GO!\u201d", "Author": "YaraN", "ReviewID": "UR121110535", "Content": "Well the interior of the hotel was nice, EVERYTHING ELSE terrible!

We found this Hotel based on TripAdvisor. Chose it due to its proximity to the American Hospital, which we visited. At first taxi drivers could not find the Hotel; but it was useful to have the phone # of the Hotel, and they would ring and get precise directions. The hotel is close to the Osmanbey metro and to the Nisantasi area. Sole disadvantage for us as a family was the hillly, difficult to climb streets. So if you have a walking disability, better not choose this hotel. If you're into sports, choose it! Comments on TripAdvisor are correct. Rooms are newly furbished, clean, pleasant. I would not say they are small; Internet is indeed very fast and free (I appreciated this most of all; as it was key for me to stay in touch with work); the bathroom is very nice; cosy; and plenty of hot water. At first the airconditioning was not working properly, but upon request the manager resolved that. So we were happy. Breakfast is not that great. Don't put much expectation. It is a minimum to survive. I hope this improves. I would choose this hotel once more if I would need to be in this area. If you're in Instabul to visit the Historical Site, do not choose this Hotel; choose something in Laleli region. Otherwise, you will have to take the Subway, then the Funikuler, then the Tram, just to get to the Historical Site. Choose this Hotel if you need to visit Nisantasi (great shopping area) or some Malls like Cevahir. Hotel staff is very polite; and helpful to call a cab, or to give directions. I chose the Hotel for the combination of Location + price; call them, prices are a bit lower than nearby hotels; it is probably because their location isn't exactly central street. Chosen for the right purpose this Hotel satisfied all needs.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "Miuccia12", "ReviewID": "UR120181234", "Content": "Stayed in Husa Vizon in September which was right when it opened.

At the beginning, was a little bit worried of the location due to one of the comments, but nothing further from the truth. I booked the transfer from the hotel which is quite affordable and found that the hotel is in a very quite location full of wholesaler textile shops. In order not to get lost in all those small streets, I have asked reception staff to give me a detailed map of the area and could so discover that in less than 15 minutes I had reached the chic street of the luxurious fashion designers, Abdi Ipekci and plenty of nice restaurants.
