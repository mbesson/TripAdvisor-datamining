It is on the Blue route in Branson (you could go to just about anywhere on the strip via the Blue route, instead of fighting traffic on 76), and only about 7 miles from Silver Dollar City. Secondly, for the money, it is hard to beat - comfortable king-sized bed w/ a fridge & microwave, clean pool complete with pool toy for our children, and FREE hot breakfast (decent variety,and they slightly vary the menus each morning). They also had a nice little note welcoming the guests, complete with some complimentary toiletries (e.g. deodorant, sample shampoos, travel toothpaste, etc).
