Even with the high expectations from reading reviews on this site, I believe this hotel actually exceeded those expectations. I think this is probably the best H. Inn I've ever stayed at (although I haven't really stayed at that many). Very modern, and eco-friendly, with a boutique feel to it. The hotel must be pretty new, based on its appearance. The lobby is on the 6th floor, and is very inviting. The staff were very friendly and definitely helpful. There is a lobby bar and a pool on that floor. There is a rooftop bar as well, but I didn't make it up there. As a gold member, I got upgraded to a studio suite. Pretty nice suite! Not huge, but sufficient. The suite had a small pantry area with a separate sink and small refrigerator. Comfortable bed, shower with really good water pressure and a nice-sized TV for the size of the room (estimating 40\") that would swivel to give you the best view from anywhere you were sitting (or laying). The hotel was very clean, from inside the room to the lobby and the hallways. The location was ideal - within walking distance of Mary Brickell Village, with lots of shops and good restaurants - and close to the Metro Mover (the free tram that travels throughout the downtown area). I would definitely stay here again, and have already recommended it to others.

Our cab from MIA was $30 with tip. The hotel has only been open since November 2011, so we understood when the cab driver didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite know what hotel I was talking about! Luckily I had the actual street address, which helped him. We arrived at the Hotel at about 8:30pm and were given a beautiful room on the top floor (the 16th floor). We could even see a bit of Brickell Bay out our window, which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hesitate to book this hotel again for a pre-cruise stay. The newness of the hotel itself is definitely a draw, and the convenience of the location makes it a ridiculously easy choice to make. The pool area is beautiful, and the Lobby bar looks out onto it. The bar stayed open until the pool closed at 11. Loved that. For dinner, we walked over to Mary Brickell Village and ate at Burger & Beer Joint. AWESOME! Excellent burgers...rare beers that I have a hard time finding where we live. My only complaint about the hotel was the breakfast. I am HHonors Gold, and do stay at quite a few Hampton Inns. I am usually happy with the free breakfast, but even going down for breakfast at 8:30 both mornings, we were greeted with an empty vat of oatmeal, and NO bananas. Two things I eat for breakfast every morning! We actually laughed about the fact that we were in Miami and there were no bananas. We were there just before the Miami Marathon, so we thought maybe the runners bought out the whole city. :) During our free day in Miami (Friday), we hopped on the Metromover (just steps from the hotel) and rode it down to Omni Station, where we boarded the Beach Max #120 -- limited stops to South Beach for $2. It was a quick trip out to the beach. We ate at Front Porch Cafe, strolled along the sand, did a fair amount of people watching, and then headed back out and found a bus stop back to downtown. There are also two Publix supermarkets within walking distance, so we were able to buy some items for the cruise. The shuttle to the Port of Miami was $8 per person.

Oscar made me maps, called good cab drivers, and put in touch with the right people and things for a first time visit. Eric did great work initially when I had trouble with a bad taxi driver from airport.

That said, everything is fresh and new and that is sometimes hard to beat in a hotel. We used the property as \"jumping off\" point for our Caribbean cruise. Finding the hotel was out greatest challenge as it sits directly off of S. Miami Avenue. Miami has unique naming of its streets (i.e., SW 11th Street, SE 1st Avenue) and that was confusing. However, once we located the property, we were all set. The hotel sits on a quiet street directly in front of a high rise condo building and a bank on the corner. The actual hotel starts on Floor 6. You enter the building and are greeted by a building security attendant who directs you to the elevator and the hotel. The extra sense of security is a nice touch. Our room was on the fifteenth floor overlooking the northern Brickell area and was perfect in all ways. Check-in was quick and efficient, plenty of available on-site parking ($18/night charge), the room/bathroom was clean and there are lots of nearby dining options. Our room was not large, but well designed and efficient for 2 travelers. Our bed was comfortable with many extra pillows. The bathroom was clean and did not have a tub; rather, a large double door shower. Plenty of sink counter space. The property is unique in that you need your room card in order to operate the elevator - a very nice security feature. The area is quite safe. You can easily walk to many different dining options and specialty stores as well as a Publix grocery store. The area is very active in the evening and walking north along S Miami Avenue is best. Two blocks east is Brickell Avenue, a main thoroughfare, which has many high rise office buildings and condos. Breakfast is included in the daily rate and was quite good - lots of both hot and cold ala carte options. There is a bar on the 6th floor as well. We used the hotel as a starting point for a cruise from the Port of Miami. Taxi fare to the port was $15 and we where there in less than 10 minutes. Our daily rate was quite reasonable as well. Miami hotels can get quite expensive and our rate was about $110 including taxes. I think once this property becomes established, the rates will increase dramatically. This property looks and acts very much like a Hyatt as opposed to a Hampton. Highly recommended.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNo bathtub!!!!\u201d", "Author": "dino4897", "ReviewID": "UR121100104", "Content": "Excellent location.

We had a large room (queen studio suite) with two queens and a sofa-bed, which was very comfortable for a family, as were the kitchenette with fridge, coffee maker and microwave. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor does not really fall in my taste, but it does not bother me for a couple of nights. The beds were very comfortable (not surprisingly, as the hotel had only been open some weeks).

It's located within approximately two blocks of the Mary Brickell shopping and dining area and within a short walk of the US-1 business district and the Miami metromover monorail system, making it centrally located for business travellers and tourists alike. The hotel had only been open a month during my stay so the parking garage barriers weren't working correctly but this didn't cause me any problems. The parking garage was very well lit - parking was an absolute bargain for Miami at $18. The elevators are swipe card access-only for guest floors, which I thought was a very good security feature. The hotel is vibrantly decorated with a modern, relaxed feel. Although there are lots of bright colors it was tastefully decorated and well laid out. Unfortunately, I didn't get to use the gym, so can't comment on the equipment or layout. The breakfast was included in the price and was satisfactory. There was a selection of hot foods (sausage, eggs, etc), waffles, fresh fruits, yoghurt and coffee. The hot meal on my first morning was luke warm but still edible. The next day the meal was hot .The breakfast staff were attentive and friendly and the eating area was very clean and well laid out. The seating area was a mixture of tables and a breakfast bar, and well spread out. My suite felt airy and was well lit with natural light, despite being directly over the road from a large apartment building. I kept the net curtains closed for the majority of the time for privacy. The room had a number of nice touches, such as chaise lounge in a corner that doubled up as a sofa. The large screen TV was flat against a wall and folds out to allow you to watch it in bed or from the chaise. The small entry area had a refrigerator and work surface, which was nice to throw keys, phone, paperwork on. I also had a large desk with table lamp to use in the room. The bathroom had a bath/shower and toilet and plenty of lighting. I noted the bathroom door had rubber stoppers on the moulding to stop the door from making noise when closed - a great touch to stop you from waking up your partner in the middle of the night when nature calls. The large king-sized bed was very comfortable. I used the complimentary wireless internet connectivity and found it to be one of the most hassle free I'd used to date. It was fast enough to let me video conference without jerkiness or stuttering. Following my experience, I intend to make this hotel my regular accomodation when I'm in Miami on business.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hampton Inn & Suites Miami/Brickell-Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d2253238-Reviews-Hampton_Inn_Suites_Miami_Brickell_Downtown-Miami_Florida.html", "Price": "$164 - $310*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">50 SW 12th Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Miami</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33130</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2253238", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/33/2d/e6/hotel-exterior.jpg"}}
