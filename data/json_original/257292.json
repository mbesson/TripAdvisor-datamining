I stayed at the Gemini for 2 nights with my mother and 22 yo daughter. We paid $120 per night for a Family Room. When we arrived at Central Station I rang the hotel to arrange a transfer and was told it would be about 20-25 mins. We had a coffee at the station and went outside where the minibus picked us up on time. We were driven to the hotel and were checked in by a lovely young man who also arranged for a transfer to take us to the airport the next morning where my daughter was catching an international flight. We were given the keys to Room 501 which was quite a large room with a queen bed and two singles. The room overlooked the main street and we had views to the Harbour Bridge. The room was clean, the sheets and towels white and spotless. Tea, coffee, milk and biscuits were supplied. The bathroom was only small and a rather bizarre shape but there was plenty of hot water and a great shower rose. We asked for advice as to where to have a good cheap meal and were given directions to the Randwick Labor Club just around the corner. We were also given a drink voucher to redeem with a Main Meal at the club. There are plenty of other restaurants all within walking distance of the hotel however we found the meal at the RLC to be very good. The next morning we were picked up on time for our transfer to the airport. My mother and I returned to the hotel by taxi (our choice, I'm sure the hotel would have picked us up). The taxi fare was $40. Later in the afternoon we took a taxi into central Sydney at a cost of $20. The rooms overlooking the street can be a bit noisy (it is a main street in a Sydney suburb after all) however, I always wear earplugs so I didn't notice. The bathroom certainly was one of the smaller ones I've been in but I don't tend to spend much time in the bathroom and I couldn't complain about the cleanliness or lack of amenities. My family and I have used the Gemini Hotel on many occasions as a stopover before a flight. This hotel is ideal for use as an airport hotel. It's as cheap as chips ($240 for 2 nights for up to four people, which included at least $60 worth of free transfers and a drink voucher). I would definitely recommend this hotel.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Griffith", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "GriffithYvon", "ReviewID": "UR48945179", "Content": "We stayed at the Gemini for 4 days, due to a family member in Hospital, The Gemini is in walking distance of the hospital and very close to shops and restaurants which are all very reasonably priced, bus close to front door and free bus service to airport.

Chose it because it was supposedly near the airport, it offered free airport transfers and the website made it look ok. First of all, when we returned our hire car to the airport, we looked for the courtesy bus. We were directed to the general area where all the buses picked up from. After waiting to see if a bus turned up, I telephoned to ask whether we could be picked up. There was confusion as to where the pick up would take place from, I was told to go to a different place. However other drivers insisted that the bus picked up from where we were standing. Anyway after a half hour wait, we were collected, the mini bus looked rather beaten up. The hotel was a considerable drive from the airport, being in the suburb of Randwick. First impressions of the lobby were good, and as shown on the website. However, once we got into the lift things got worse, the inside was quite tired and the landings were the same. We had 2 rooms, a family room and a twin. The family room was ok, looked quite recently painted and certainly appeared to be clean, although some of the furniture was quite old looking. The twin room was a different matter, it was a ghastly, puke colour, with tired furniture. My friend, who stayed in it, said everything 'was broken'. If our stay had been for longer than 1 night, I would have been very disappointed and asked to move. At the time of our visit, the hotel restaurant was being refurbished and arrangements had been made for guests to use the nearby labour club. I think this was a good move because we stayed there as long as possible to avoid going back to our rooms and the surroundings were good. On the plus side, when we arrived, we booked a time for our return trip to the airport and that worked well. The location of the hotel is right in the middle of the 'high street', which meant some street noise early in the morning but did mean that there were plenty of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.
