Fast, efficient, friendly check-in. Room was very spacious, nicely furnished. Bed was king size and very comfortable. Beautiful marble tiled bathroom with full bath and very spacious. In a great location, with several great restaurants and cafes close by. Short bus ride into the city. Housekeeping ignored requests for extra tea bags, and our friends also had their request for extra pillows ignored.Only downside was that it is very noisy, in that you can hear people talking loudly in the passage, and doors seemed to be slamming all night. The doors to the rooms do not have an efficient stopper on them, so you could hear every door all the way along the passage as it closed.

My husband and I stayed at the Stamford Plaza for my brother-in-law's wedding. We arrived early and couldn't check in. We were happy to go for a wander as Double Bay is a beautiful area of Sydney. However, the hotel said that they would call when room was ready, but they did not. We eventually got sick of waiting and went back and they checked us in, no apology for not calling us. Despite this little hiccup, our stay at the hotel was great. The rooms are very dated, they look like an old English hotel, so if you are looking for modern decor this hotel is not for you. The bathrooms are big with bath and the beds are king size which is nice. Room service was efficient with friendly staff and were willing to make things not on the menu. Buffet breakfast was really good also. Other than the check-in staff, found all other staff to most helpful.We needed to leave my husband's hire suit at reception to be collected and they were happy to do that also left shoes in the hotel and they were happy to post these to me.

When you arrive by taxi you need to walk upstairs or take the lift up to the lobby.

Watch the bill on the way out! We stayed at the Stamford under their Celebration Package, as we were having a much-needed weekend away together. The Celebration Package has High Tea and Breakfast included.Check-in was reasonably quick and friendly.We had the High Tea on the day of check-in. They have a number of levels of High Tea, for which the one included with the package was the middle of the road. The food was quite nice, and fresh. I'm just glad that we had it as part of our package, as at $31, it was incredibly expensive for what you get. Quite average. If you're looking for High Tea, go to the InterContinental instead.The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and we had a great nights sleep. Overall, the room was a bit dated and tired, but if you're a local, you go in there expecting it.We were shocked at the buffet breakfast. When we arrived, there was absolutely no-one there. A bit disconcerting for a 5-star hotel in Sydney!Overall, the stay wasn't unpleasant. However, the people service at the hotel was just lacklustre. There was no enthusiasm, no desire to make our stay enjoyable.Also, the breakfast was loaded onto the bill on checkout; which it shouldn't have been under our package.

Still the accommodations were very comfortable and clean. My husband has the habit of leaving his valuables lying around and on this occasion did not disappoint.
