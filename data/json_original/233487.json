{"Reviews": [{"Content": "great stay at de rose hotel I enjoyed five wonderful nights stay at de Rose Palace Hotel. The staff were most helpful, had my trips to the Galleries Booked for me in advance, avoiding very long queues. Great location, walking distance to rail station and centre of city. It was very quiet at night and perfectly clean. I would recommend it.

Single rooms a little small This hotel was ok but certainly not a 4 star hotel. The hotel has seen better days and the entry looks as if it has not been updated since the late 70's.The room I was given was small but comfortable. There is a small flat screen TV and SKY box (when it works). The hotel supports wireless internet which can be a little slow at times.The room was clean but looked as if it needed a lick of paint to refresh it. Breakfast was included in the 100 Euro price and is a cold buffet with coffee/tea and fruit juices.The stafff were all very helpful and friendly.There is nothing special about this hotel and there is nothing really wrong with it either apart from the rating would not match the expectations.", "Date": "Sep 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR184268113", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A trip advisor from California"}, {"Content": "Great little place! My good friend and I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights. Lucilla (the owner) and Stephano (evening desk clerk) were wonderful! At one point, my friend's daughter was due to have a baby anytime, and Lucilla let her use the hotel's computer to check email. No charge. Stephano open countless bottles of wine for us and helped us find our way around Florence. The room was just fine. The beds were comfortable and the room was cleaned well each day. Breakfast was very good, too.It was just slightly off the beaten path, which I liked. Also, it was only about 15 minutes (walking) to the train station, so it was convenient for us. I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "Mar 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR708841456", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Sammiedog"}, {"Content": "Disappointing This hotel definitely needs a refurb. quite shabby. When we saw the room we asked to upgrade, we were told it was the best room in the hotel, we were shown 3 other rooms and they were even tattier. No parking facility, we were charged 24 euros for garaging. Thank goodness we were only there 1 nt. Would rate this 2 star. definitely not 4.

We stayed at the Rose Palace after being sent there when our original hotel couldn't accomodate us due to unexplained water problems. We were dubious at first, as the Rose Palace is not as close to the centre of Florence as we'd have liked, but after checking in we were totally enchanted by this hotel. The room was lovely, tastefully decorated and quite large. The bathroom was more than adequate and had a good supply of soap, shower gel etc. It was spotlessly clean. The bed was very comfortable with good-quality pillows and luxurious linen sheets. It is in a quiet street and although it is about 20-25 minutes walk from the centre of Florence, the peace and quiet is very welcome after a day of navigating thorough crowds of tourists, street vendors, beggars, etc. We can certainly recommend the Rose Palace to anyone who wants something special, with charming touches of luxury and a bit different to the usual style of generic, characterless hotel room. We would certainly stay there again!", "Date": "Oct 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR223854431", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "baroque-boys"}, {"Content": "Undiscovered quiet gem of a place Stayed at this charming, off the beaten path hotel July 2004. The rooms are beautifully furnished to be appreciated by the discriminating traveller. I even liked the pictures on the walls, the turkish rugs, the apricot bed covers. It was such a delight to come home to from the hustle and bustle of the historic center of the city! The first few nights the a/c worked just fine, but the last night had to ask them to turn it on. This is a gem that should be saved for those who can appreciate good taste, peace and quiet and enjoy a small but friendly enough place and don't need a lot of extras but revel in the lovely colors in the rooms, the romantic fireplace and the excellent breakfast. It is a bit of a hike to walk home from where the action is but then one can really relax. I liked this place very much.", "Date": "Aug 1, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR302761509", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "doubtful De rose palace is the typical four star hotel. It is located in a nice, quiet area, close to major sights. The rooms are big enough, extremely clean and comfortable. Breakfast is excellent.
