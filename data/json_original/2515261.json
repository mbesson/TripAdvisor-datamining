Hotel itself is very well located to mix business with pleasure (Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elysees are so close, some good restaurants and brasseries very near); air conditioned rooms are quiet and bathrooms are great.

I was not counting on anything too great just well priced and a good location, but I was surprised and delighted with this little gem of a hotel. It was spotlessly clean and tidy, the bathroom was modern, the breakfast, (continental) was inexpensive and good quality. The air conditioning worked brilliantly, housekeeping was excellent during the week, (not as good on the weekends), the Internet worked but needed adjustments regularly, (once or twice a day), but they happily took care of that with a quick phone call from me to the desk downstairs. The minibar in my room did not work at all, I'm not certain if they work in the other rooms, and I was a little disappointed in that but overall I would recommend it and I would not hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cWell located!,\u201d", "Author": "Ruleen", "ReviewID": "UR113793270", "Content": "We stayed at this what we called budget hotel. The rooms are rather small but comfortable. The toilets are very clean and nice, nicer than the room itself. We liked the location of this hotel as it is about 80metres away from the nearest metro- Charles de gulle-etoile. There are also several eateries beside the hotel and s supermarket nearby for us to buy our water from. The rooms have free wifi but the connection tends to be a little on and off sometimes but in the whole, we could still use the wifi when we wanted, so not an issue. The staff were generally friendly as said by previous reviewer except for the lady owner who wasn't too friendly throughout the stay. It could be due to her tone of voice or something. But I think she meant no harm, she is just doing her business. Ha. We encountered an electricity loss on one of the nights and had to walk up the stairs coz the lift was not working and heater and lights on our floor were also not working.
