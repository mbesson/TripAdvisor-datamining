We stayed in Room 202 - Oh my goodness! Never have we stayed in such a tatty, grotty room! The decor was very dated - the furniture from the 1950's, mould in the bathroom, leaking toilet, window that did not close, broken lampshade the website pictures were not representative of our room. Really misleading - does this room really exist in the hotel? Found the hotel on the internet and booked due to the pleasant picture of a \"Triple Room\". Our room was sold as a Triple but was a twin with a fold up bed as the third bed - not great for our 14 year old. Very minimal space - I had to climb over the fold up bed to get into bed. The furniture has seen many decades!! Wooden panelled headboard with integrated radio - probably very modern in 1950's but no longer in operation. The bathroom was grim with black mould between all the tiles. We arrived at 11pm - so decided just to get into bed and sleep. We had checked out by 9am - couldn't stay for a minute longer than necessary. We didn't even bother to try the breakfast.

We requested additional tea making supplies from the desk and they were given with a smile. The central heating bolier was broken for the 2 days of our stay but additional bedding was supplied within minutes by the desk staff. Breakfast -If you want a cooked English breakfast it will cost \u00c2\u00a34 extra but the continental breakfast was plentiful and tasty. Times are 7am to 10 am which allowing for the turnover means no problems with tables. The location is ideal for Paddington station -just a couple of minutes away. Now the bad news - The room was 508 which is on the top floor in the corner. It is obviously a converted attic with sloping walls. The double bed leaves about a foot clearance at the bottom. There is no wardobe just two short posts fixed to the wall each containing 2 hangers. Had the window been clear we would have had a nice view of St Marys Hospital but in fairness we were not there for the hotel room. The carpet was threadbare and there were broken floor tiles in the bathroom. The room had an air of neglect about it and needed decoration. In fairness it was clean and the double bed was very comfortable. As regards the rest of the hotel facilities -well really they were not upto much! Cads the 'cafe/bar' in the basement was exactly that - a dingy basement room with an outside entrance with a large tv at one end that advertisies itself as the cheapest beer in the area . A candle-light supper it is not! Reading other reviews its quite clear that the top floor (5) should be avoided at all costs.

It is true that you should not be fooled by the reception area which is rather grand compared to the rest of the hotel. The lift is small and you have to wait for people to make their trips on occasions. The hotel could do with updating it's true and in places it's a bit shabby but our room was clean our bathroom a reasonable size and our shower was very good.

Breakfast was ok a bit limited but if you are willing to pay the \u00c2\u00a34 (which the member of staff told us about when we gave the room number) the cooked breakfast is very good. As an added tip: If you decide before you go into the dining room you want the cooked breakfast then tell the memebr of staff who greets you to save them coming up to you when you're getting your breakfast. In all fairness to them the room is very busy and they have to keep track of who has it or not.

I would stay again but not for the type of trip we went on which was shows and sightseeing as paddington is quite for on the tube. I sympathise with those who paid alot for this hotel as then I would be disapointed and annoyed but through a package deal with theatre tickets we only ended up paying just over \u00c2\u00a350 a night and for that price in London this hotel is luxury. Anyone who stays and says it's small I recommend you stay at a certain Bright orange company hotel as those rooms were ridiculous and far more expensive.

We asked three different members of staff for sauce and were fobbed off each time.

We were told our room was on the 5th floor and directed to the lift, it was here I began to doubt our choice of hotel.

As soon as the door opened our hearts sank, I thought we had been allocated a loft conversion, the once magnolia painted walls were dirty and cracked the supposedly white skirting boards were scuffed and dirty, the furniture had certainly seen its better days the 60's most probably, also a roller blind instead of curtains. The bathroom matched the room with its dirty grouting and leaking shower. I thought i'd switch the TV on and surprise, surprise it only picked up one station!!! We decided that we would spend as little time as possible in the room so went out earlier than we had planned. When we reluctantly returned to our room, and decided to go to bed, I had to climb over the bed in order to get into my side as there was not enough room to walk round.

Arrived at the hotel quite early, but the staffed checked and got my room ready within 15 minutes. I had gotten room 503, top floor and from what I could make it was one of the refurbished rooms. Sure, it was not very big, it was a single room, but I had no plans for ballroom dancing... The radiator was on, and hot, but it was easily turned off and I could also open the window to let cool air in to the room. Being on the top floor, no noise bothered me from the street, sure, you heard it, but you're in one big city, what do you expect? Clean and functional bathroom, with the typical English shower handle and tap system, once again, you're not at home so deal with it. Extensive breakfast, fully sufficient and for a mere \u00c2\u00a34 you could get English Breakfast if you needed something to last longer. Clean and fresh.

I decided to book a 2 night break to London for my partners birthday, so i chose this hotel on the basis of loation and the photographs from the hotel website. After i booked it i looked at some reviews (silly order to do it i know!) and i was horrified by what i was reading. But i thought that sometimes reviews can be harsh and people have different expectations of what comfort is. We as a couple are not really fussy, we believe that you only spend time sleeping and washing in the room so belongs if the room is comfortable and spacious and also clean enough then thats good enough for us! When we walked into the hotel (11am) we were greeted by a freindly receptionist who told us that we could leave our bags with them until check in at 2pm. Great i thought! helpful staff, the reception looked ok and the location was perfect. So off we went to enjoy our first day in london. We arrived back at the hotel at around 3pm (an hour after check in) to be told that we were unable to check in because someone was in our room checking that the telephone was working. Ok i thought, fair enough, 20 minutes later we were finally allowed up. Then the real joy began, what i am about to describe here is not being over dramatic, every word i write is as true as true can be, The corridoor to our room was very hot and smelt of smoke, the carpets in the halls were fraying and the decor looked like it was fresh out of miami vice. When we arrived at our room we found a single room with a double bed squashed in the corner. Our carpet was also fraying, wallpaper was hanging off the walls, there was damp and mould on the bedroom wall. The tv looked as old as my grandfather and only had 5 channels. On the tea/coffee tray there were opened tea bags and milk cartons. In the bathroom the pipes, taps and shoer heads were covered in limescale. Our toilet did not flush properly and the bath took approx 10 mintues until the water began running hot. Back in our room, the radiator was not working properly, you either had to have it on full blast which was way too verpowering for the size of the room or you had to turn it off and be cold in the draught from the rotton window we had.

The second night, I found the switch on the 'console' between the beds!! I was brave enough to test the switches... (TV/Radio switch didn't work though so I was surprised that the lights did!!!) The sheets had seen better days and felt quite 'bobbly' and everytime I turned over, the bed creaked very loudly. Couldn't sleep though.... the window lodged open for some air circulation meant that the loud humming from below carried on all night til about 4am!! Oh how I wished I had taken my ipod!! Got back the second day from the conference with my colleague and we needed a vodka! Went downstairs to 'Cads cafe bar' hotel bar???? OMG 2 women walking in there..... we felt quite uncomfortable when a room full of workmen stared!!! Surprised there was no sawdust on the floor..... The barmaid was obviously not used to serving Vodka and slimline either!! We didn't realise that it was entered as a public bar from the street. I will be sticking to Holiday Inn / Express/ Travel Lodge etc in future at least you know they're clean and of a 'No Frills' decent standard! Where Norfolk \"Faulty\" Towers got it's 3 stars from - well - off the back of a box of cornflakes I should think!!!

Unfortunately I was unable to share this with the receptionists when checking out as she was on the phone. Firstly I must start with the postives. The hotel itself is lovely and has a lovely character and feel to it. The location of the hotel is also fantastic! I didnt have much contact with the staff but anyone I did speak to was also friendly. And now for the not so good. Our trip to London was for leisure purposes only. All we wanted from a hotel was some where close to the centre and some were at the end of the day for us to sleep. We were given room G5 on the ground floor which i can honestly say was awful. The room was far too warm and when we opened the window there was a loud noise coming from the silver thing outside it. This noise was constant and made it impossible to sleep threw. We had booked a double room, not a twin room with 2 single beds pushed together. So along with the loud noise, the incredibly warm room and the extremely uncomfortable bed i do not feel that this hotel fulfilled my expectations of a bed to sleep in while in London. As the hotel itself is lovely and the location is great i feel that more must be done to improve the quality of the bedrooms. Unfortunately I cannot say I would visit this hotel again or recommend it to anyone as I feel it fails the basic requirement of a basic bedroom to stay overnight.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weymouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cStaying in London, you can do much better!\u201d", "Author": "Kiwiabroad60", "ReviewID": "UR62580305", "Content": "Best thing about the hotel was the receptionist, polite and friendly.

When I read them I was very worried indeed. I noted that the refurbished rooms were getting ok reviews, so before I travelled I rang the hotel and asked about these rooms. I was told they were the executive rooms, but that I probably could have one, they couldn't promise though.I chose the hotel for it's proximity to Paddington station, and it was only about 5 minutes walk away. When I arrived, I was indeed given an executive room, on the 5th floor. First impressions of the hotel, the public area was very nice, clean, and the reception staff helpful. Took the lift to the 5th floor as I have not been well recently and couldn't face the stairs. It was a tiny lift, quite shabby and the notice said it took no more than 6 people. To be honest, I was in there with one other person and felt uncomfortably close, so any more would have been out of the question for me. The room itself was a very small single. No wardrobe (no room for one!) but a stick attached to the wall with coat hangers on there. TV on a trolley so I could arrange it to suit, discovered later that the 1 button on the remote didn't work, so couldn't get BBC1, but as I was only there for one night and was going out anyway, didn't worry too much. Bed was comfy enough, but because of the room location, the wall next to the bed sloped inwards, so I bashed my arm quite a bit when I turned over. Bathroom was fine, small but clean. Anyone any bigger than me might have a problem as my knees were against the bath while I was on the toilet (ok, TMI). The temperature was fine, but although I was on the 5th floor, I still heard a lot of street noise, and in the morning the noise of the wind was terrible. Ok, so it was windy, but this sounded like there was a hurricane going on! I was mentally preparing to give the hotel an ok review, till it came to breakfast. Not much you can do to spoil a continental breakfast? Think again! First off tried croisants. They were rock hard. The yogurt was the cheapest you can get without getting ASDA basics, very thin and not a lot of taste. Looked at the fruit salad, it was just cut up apple, so didn't bother with that. So I thought, ok, have some toast, a do it yourself affair, but then most are these days. Took a bite and had to leave it, it was the cheapest bread going, and not at all tasty. There were cerials available, and some dodgy looking cheese, but I didn't bother with this and just left.

I had previously researched lots of hotels and as we needed to keep the cost down this hotel seemed the best of a bad bunch. I was aware of the bad reviews but we decided that as we only needed somewhere to sleep for 8 hours and a shower in the morning that we would take the risk. The reviews on here that I have read are spot on. The reception area / check in wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad and we did actually start to think that maybe it would be ok. Check in was quick are the staff polite and helpful. We were sent to our rooms and to start with I could get the key in the lock of the door. I tried for several minutes and then fetching housekeeping to help. It was just me but as the handle almost felt like it was falling off I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to risk forcing it. As I entered the room I had to turn sideways to get through the door. The room was tiny with a single bed, television, telephone, wardrobe, wall mirror and tea & coffee making facilities. The room was a slightly odd shape but it was about 10 x 8. Even if you took all the furniture out you still could not have got 2 single beds in next to each other. Bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Bed was ok for comfort although I got the feeling it was old as you did tend to sink into it slightly. The 2 pillows were comfy however the bedding did have marks on it, although I do think they were stains that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come out in the wash rather than unwashed bedding. T.V. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realise ones this old were still around. There was no remote however I think it was probably before remotes existed. There were the usual channels 1 -5 and Sky News. The picture was fuzzy. Wardrobe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was ok although you could only half open the door as the bed was in the way. Tea & coffee making facilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This was probably the best thing about the room, enough for 2 drinks although didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recognise the brands. Coffee tasted ok. One thing to be aware of in here is that the room gets very hot so you may want to rethink about staying here in the summer months. There was a fan but it was pretty useless and the sun was on the room all day. The window did open but again it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really help. In fact it was so hot I had to take a cold shower just to cool down. The temperature had cooled down however when we returned at midnight and I was able to sleep comfortably with the fan on and window open (the 6-7 drinks may have also helped!) although by 10:30am it had really got hot again that I just had to get out. I found the room very quiet and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really hear any noise until about 10:30am when the cleaners started. There was this weird bedside table thing that seemed to have a radio built in, it was wooden. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they were probably around in the 70s. I have no idea if it worked or not. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the room was not nice, carpet looked like it could do with a clean, bits of wallpaper peeling off, patches on the ceiling where some water seemed like it had leaked at some stage. Paint was peeling off the window frame and sill and the skirting boards and door frames were very scuffed. The bathroom again was very small although fairly clean. It was a little difficult to get to the toilet as the sink was in the way. The shower was tiny and there did seem to be some mould on the tiles. The shower curtain stuck to my back for the whole of the shower which grossed me out! I hate shower curtains at the best of times they are so unhygienic. There was only shower gel available. There was hot water available in the shower however you probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want it due to the heat. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat or drink in the hotel so cannot comment on the food etc. There were free newspapers available in reception in the morning. On a positive note it is very convenient for the Bakerloo line just a couple of minutes walk away. To summarise I would not stay here again and I would not recommend it to a friend but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you could do worse. You will not get ill from staying here so if you do need a cheap room you may want to consider it for 1 night however the size of the room would do your head in if you were planning to spend any time other than sleeping in there.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "cheshire", "Title": "\u201c2nd option!! not out of choice\u201d", "Author": "bowiecheshire", "ReviewID": "UR7429605", "Content": "After booking The Blakemore hotel several weeks ago i recieved a phone call the morning of travel telling me they were over booked and moving us to their sister hotel.It was a bit late to do anything at such short notice.we arrived at the hotel a little early but were given our room,it was small and with very old fashioned furnishings it was reasonably clean but a little shabby.The bathroom was small with an ancient shower (although hot).

We would not go back to this hotel though, even although the price was good.", "Date": "July 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staffordshire, England", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5232782", "Content": "24and 25 May 2006 stayed at the Norfolk Towes Hotel in oder that my wife and I with two friends could visit the Chelsea Flower Show. We all agreed that the cleanliness of our rooms was exceptional. This standard of cleanliness was also reflected throughout the hotel. Whist booking in the reception clerk realised that we had arrived as a party of four and immediately asked our friends if they would like to transfer to the same floor as ourselves. The breakfast we had booked was continental but when arriving in the dining room on the first morning we were offered the full English Breakfast for a price difference of \u00c2\u00a33. Both Full English and Continental breakfasts were excellent.

The Good Points: Lots of hot water. Close to Paddington railway station. Good pub at the end of the street. The Bad Points: The room was so small only one of you could stand up at one given time. (double room) The bed was jammed against the wall, making it impossible to get out in the middle of the night. The patio doors were so rotten they would not close, causing us to have two sleepless nights from the noise outside. Bed sheets were dirty, We were bitten in the night!! Badly in need of re-decoration and maintence. The lift would only take you down to the basement, but would not bring you back again, (that was if you were luckly enough to get it in the first place) The lift doors also did not open fully making it difficult to get in/out with luggage. Continental breakfast was included, which was poor. Booked through hotels direct. Would not stay at the Norfolk Towers again.", "Date": "May 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dungannon, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cAs good as you pay\u201d", "Author": "snicks069", "ReviewID": "UR4999121", "Content": "My husband and i stayed in Norfolk Towers over Easter. Below are the pro's and con's of the hotel: Pros: Clean, tidy, good location, excellent pub at end of the road, tube station 2 minutes walk. cons: Room en-suite small, no wardrobe but ther was a hook and hangers on the wall, water from shower lacked power to say the least, room was on the 5th floor and very warm with very little ventilation. Overall comments, the stay was comfortable althoughif you roll out of bed you would be in the bathroom without having to actually stand up. Lift was very slow but even more scary was that it was tiny - it says that it hold six people, i would have panicked if there was more than 2 in the lift at one time. We didnt have breakfast in the hotel but waited until we got into the centre of london and had better choice and ready to sight-see after eating. Great pub at the end of the road, cant remember the name but do gorgeous pub grub (price was excellent) and the atmosphere was like being in a pub at home. I would recommend the hotel to young people or a couple. Kids or more mature couple who need that bit more luxury i wouldnt recommend - for \u00c2\u00a350 a room you get what you pay for so dont expect anything more. P.S. - for those who complained about the hotel service, i agree that the old guy on reception is a grumpy thing but dont take it personally - after watching him speaking to another staff member i think he is Norfolk Towers version of 'Victor Meldrew'.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "stevenage herts", "Title": "\u201cReminded me of Faulty Towers!!??\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4724712", "Content": "Stayed here with my husband for a night in London. Close to Paddington Station, which come in handy. The room was very small. The double bed was against one wall which made it difficult to get out of if you needed to use the toilet in the night(climbing over one another)The TV packed up after 5 mins watching Dick N Dom in the morning! I nearly split my head open due to the angle of the TV when i first entered the room. There was an awful smell as you passed the corridor on 2nd floor. Never the lift when you wanted it. The ground floor seemed to be the place i wished i'd been put as this looked much more appealing and smelt far nicer than the 2nd. Breakfast was ok and did the trick but not sure i'd stay her again. The window would not stay open so had to be propped up with a toilet roll. One good thing there was plenty of HOT water! All in all this hotel was okay, so glad we didn't stay any longer!I'm not really a one to whinge, but it wasn't the greatest i have to say!", "Date": "March 22, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Norfolk Towers Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d192083-Reviews-The_Norfolk_Towers_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$133 - $335*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">34 Norfolk Place</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Paddington</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W2 1QW</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "192083", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/b7/4d/ba/hotel-exterior.jpg"}}
