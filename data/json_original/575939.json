{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good stay but not exactly what I expected My family (husband, mom, two twenty-something year old nephews and I) stayed here for four nights in November. I was very disappointed in the fact that this was listed as a 3BR/3BA apt. when in reality it was only a 2BR/3BA. As another poster stated, the third room is actually a study. If the sofa in the room had been a sofa bed, than listing the room as a bedroom would have been okay, but that was not the case. The sofa was not even big enough for someone to sleep on. When I called Guest Services they initially told me I would be charged for a rollaway bed if one was available. My husband and I walked back to registration to complain and were told the first bed was free but there would be a charge (I think $30USD per day) for another rollaway. One of my nephews was forced to sleep on the sofa in the living room. The rest of the apt. was pretty luxurious. The master bedroom was enormous and the second bedroom was also nice and had a bathroom in the bedroom. The kitchen was fully-equipped and there was a full-sized washer and dryer in the unit.We never found the supermarket across the street and did not think that many other restaurants and stores were within walking distance. It is not that easy for taxis to find the Marriott so we got dropped off at the front gate and walked back. Luckily I had hired a car and driver for the time we were there so we did not take taxis that much.Compared to other hotel breakfasts the Marriott was so-so. The number of hot items was limited. Other Chinese hotels have had a much bigger spread and a variety of dim sum.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR881459986", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Hackers2"}, {"Content": "Great rooms but out of the way. My husband daughter and I stayed in the Marriott Palm Springs for 6 nights in December. We booked a 2 bedroom apartment and it was spacious, beautifully decorated and clean. We weren't guaranteed a non-smoking room and sure enough, we didn't get one. The smell was quite bad for the first day or two but then wore off. These apartments are really designed for travelling business people. The kitchens are gleaming because they are never used. There are no cooking utensils to be found and when I asked at reception for a saucepan to cook some pasta was told they are not available. That being said, there was little else wrong with the room. Food in the hotel consists of a decent breakfast buffet with a mix of Asian and Western food. After breakfast there is no food to be had in the hotel. Only a coffee machine which operates all day and gives quite nice coffee. Across the road is Chaoyang Park which is enormous and a lovely place to wander. We found an amusement park and though it was Winter and the park looked deserted we found there were some ride operaters and ended up riding a small roller coaster, which was fun. A few kilometres up our road is a pretty good shopping area. Buses cost 1 yuan to get there and to ride the subway costs 2 yuan. Taxis are plentiful and cheap. The staff at our hotel were polite and helpful. Had I done more research, I may not have stayed at this hotel mainly because of the lack of easily obtaining food but we were very, very comfortable and the accommodation cost was certainly not budget breaking - around $250 AUD per night for a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment.", "Date": "Jan 2, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR151116451", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ratty7"}, {"Content": "Great For Family I stayed here because I want to have my 76 years old mother close to myself and wife in our Beijing trip. Originally I booked a two bedrooms, two baths unit. Right before we departed for Beijing, I found out a Beijing relative is willing to spend sometime with us and stayed overnight, so I changed the booking to three bedrooms unit for a short time.We arrived and was told three bedrooms were actually two big bedrooms with own bathrooms, and a third study room that can accomodate a rolling bed, and a non attached bathroom. My relative left after two days, so we moved down to a two bedrooms unit. The three bedrooms unit is not only larger in total area, the inside is plusher, and more luxurious.We made use of the nice kitchen to heat leftover, and was happy to find washer/dryer.Palm Spring Executive Apartments is the most exclusive apartments in Beijing, Marriott is housed in tower 11.Included breakfast is great. Service is impeccable.Location is a little far, not within walking distance to any subway, but there is bus station in the front.I ended up taking taxi everywhere I went, but taxi fare is cheap in Beijing .Within walking distance is an restaurant called Junwangfu Peninsular Resturant, in the Chaoyang Park, and the place used to be the royal residence. We ate there and the food was great. At the attached Palm Spring shopping center, there is a cash atm from Citibank, and I got money there easily.The separate club house has great excercise facility ,and it is comprehensive , even with a ping pong room. Because all the entrances are guarded, one can feel really safe there. I would definitely return to here next time I visit Beijing.", "Date": "Dec 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR697096282", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "strpyw"}, {"Content": "Love this place This long term executive hotel is a perfect place for a long term stay.

We got a two bedroom for about $180 US. It's a cheap cab ride into the tourist parts of the city and very fast. I stayed with a friend who snores very loudly, and given the crazy jet lag we were going to have, we wanted two bedrooms. This place is huge- what was nice was the living room where we could recover from jet lag while another slept. It was just a very comfortable way to being our trip to Asia. Very clean- large kitchen, although we didn't cook. Next to shopping and grocery store to buy water, drinks, etc. For families, this place is perfect. Just a nice way to acclimate to a far away journey. Bedrooms were large, well lit. Living room was enormous with large flat screen. Full size kitchen. Sometimes in hotels large is inversely related with quality- i.e., large rooms are usually junky and small rooms are nice and refined, but in this hotel, you have large spaces very well decorated with granite bathrooms, etc. If I had a bunch of kids, I would definitely stay here, too. Just a nice neighborhood where you are, too. Very safe and lots of expats staying nearby. Very happy we found this place. You don't earn Marriott points though- that's not so great.

This Hotel is clean and the staff here are very helpfull. This was our first time visiting Beijing and we could not have been more pleased. The Apartments are spacious and clean, they actually have hard wood floors in them and they have everything you will need for your stay including a washing machine. The Hotel has a buffet breakfast everyday that offers many different types of food. You can have anything from fruit and yogurt to authentic chinese fair, if you ask the staff they will even fry you an egg or make you an omlet.This hotel has a beautiful swimming pool and spa as a guest of the Hotel you can get a membership free of charge while you are staying at the hotel. The spa is first class. The pool is on the other side of the property this hotel has several buildings in a gated area it has a covered running track that circles the buildings as well as a playground for younger children. The area that this hotel is in is called the Chaoyang district which in fact is the wealthiest district in Beijing. The city is undergoing major contstruction so you will see roads that look nice but others are not so nice. However at no time did we ever fell threatend or unsafe in any of the areas that we visited. Remeber Beijing is HUGE so if you plan on walking bring good shoes. The Hotel is located well you will find that most things you want to see are within walking distance if you like walking if not just grab a cab most things are just a few min away. The front desk has maps for you and they have several different business cards with addresses written in Madarin for the taxi driver. Dont be afraid to ask for help the people in China will not offer to help but if asked they are more than happy to give directions.My family would stay at this Hotel again.

The one-bedroom I occupied was spacious, but the gold-plated furnishings and decor with the dark wood floor and green carpeting are not entirely my taste. Cleanliness in the rooms was so-so and amenities appear precious at this hotel (cleenex are not refilled!). The inventory check-in list did not match my check-out list, which is why I was charged for 'missing' items I had not even signed for in the first place (mostly kitchen items like can opener, cutting board, etc) or that broke during my stay (glass container). The cost is excessive and the charge for the two laundry bags in which I carried my dirty clothes to my permanent residence was absurd (CNY 24 each!) and to add insult to injury, the receptionist assured me that was standard at any hotel....not that she had ever stayed at one in this category.Service overall during my stay was poor. Staff appears poorly trained and unknowledgeable about Beijing or the surroundings. Guests categorically have to greet staff first before being greeted back. The 'at your service' button on the phone in the room is best not used: Calls are either unanswered or answered in chinese. Very helpful for foreigners!The hotel only serves daily breakfast (Identical every day, little to no choice and the same green scrambled eggs - yuck!) in a quite unpleasant lobby/banquet area space, and features no other restaurants. The attendants there try, but have no means available to please guests or make you feel good. Taxi drivers usually drop off at the front of the 11-building apartment complex, as the two Marriotto towers are in the back of the 11-building complex, resulting in a 5-minute walk through the grounds.Location at the south end of Chaoyang Park (not what one expects of a park, as there are no trees and losts of amusements only) is not ideal for business in the North Chaoyang area, but only about a 5 minute cab ride from the Workers Stadium and Sunlitun area.I did not use the pool or fitness area, as they are located in another building (walk outside across the complex). During most of my stay ,outside temperatures were well below freezing, which did not encourage a visit there, as returning from a workout or swim came with the real risk of acquiring a serious cold.", "Date": "Apr 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR621857754", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "BeijingLiner"}, {"Content": "5 Star accomodations for 3 Star price The property is really nice and the rooms descriptions are accurate.

Rooms were extremely spacious, and the kitchen was well equipped in terms of appliances, including washing machine, dishwasher, iron and ironing board. There was no cutlery/crockery/pans, but a well stocked supermarket within the complex sells all of this. There's also a pharmacy and spa, and a lovely leisure complex with a large swimming pool, as well as a gym within the apartment building.

We stayed at a 3 bedroom ambassador suite which was excellent. Initially , the driver from the airport took us round and round in circles as he could not locate the property. It is not easily located for that matter and is in between a cluster of buildings around a large garden with several points of entry and exits- all with security control. So it would make a big difference if you knew which gate was the best to approach. Anyway, the lobby is very small and check in took a bit of time as they need to take passport copies of all guests etc. Our suite was located in a different building and we were led to it through a corridor. Lightings and decorations were of a high standard and elevator access is room key card controlled for security. Our suite was on the 16th floor and had a foyer with a laundry room next to it which had an ironing room and a washer dryer as well- making life very easy when traveling with kids! A large dining area with living room adjacent to an open plan kitchen was beautifully laid out with quality furnishings. Although the booking was of a 3 bedroom suite, the fine print clarifies that the third bedroom is actually a study room. It indeed was a study room with a large sofa and ample space to place an extra bed although the housekeeping confessed it had no more extra beds. The other 2 rooms were a master bedroom with a king bed and a large bathroom with spearate showere and large windows. The other room was a queen bedroom. An extra bathroom was outside the room to cater for the bedroom and study room but there was a guest toilet as well. Free high speed internet, local calls and breakfast was also provided. Breakfast was in the lobby and nothing special. We preferred to make it ourselves in the suite kitchen. Overall service was good and as usual in China, langauage might not be very easily understood. My word of advice is always to take instructions and addresses written in Chinese along with you. Also if you are with a family, it is better to hire a minivan with a driver which does not work out too much. Overall we had a great stay and I will readily recommend it to family groups. My only gripe is there isnt any convenience store or supermarket in the complex. The nearest one is Watsons located 10 mins walking from one of the gates- but it closes at 9pm. We had arrived at 9.10 pm but the bellboy was nice enough to arrange a cab to take us to a store 10 mins away by cab and made him wait and bring us back.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR715641199", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "drsuhail"}, {"Content": "Returned to reception to ensure rate was in CNY and not USD (it was that nice)       View of complex from Living Room Window", "Date": "Mar 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR565259674", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "gregoireboyd"}, {"Content": "non \u732b oro quello che luccica   showReview(16904499, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR297083437", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gigigigigi"}, {"Content": "molto buono   showReview(15577803, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR169612718", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ger\u76f2umige Appartements f\u7709r Business oder Urlaub   showReview(11313433, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR717398532", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Conforme a nos attentes   showReview(11428598, 'full');", "Date": "May 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR565532090", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Agr\u8305able s\u8305jour au Marriot Palm Springs   showReview(7402524, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR894109439", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lemex"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d575939-r23212090-Palm_Springs_Beijing_Marriott_Executive_Apartments-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "575939", "Price": "$208"}}
