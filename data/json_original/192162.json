I paid what I felt was a fair price for a 3-star hotel in a good area of London in August. When you arrive at the hotel it looks elegant from the outside but when you enter the reception area to check in you get a bit of a surprise. Where has all the space on the ground floor gone? My question was soon to be answered. They asked for payment at the check-in which also surprised me a bit and we were allocated our room which was located at street level in front of the small reception area. There are 3 rooms located on the ground floor opposite the reception desk. The triple room was really a small double room with 3 beds in it. There was no wardrobe simply because there was not enough space in the room to install one. So with three people and 3 suitcases we were cramped for space. The bathroom was also very small . Being at street level with traffic-lights outside our room, it was quite noisy at night with the window open in the warm August weather. On the second night we decided to close the window. Breakfast is served downstairs in the basement in a rather poky dining-room. There are far fewer tables than rooms so it was not surprising that we had to wait a few minutes to get a table. We only had breakfast there once because it's not worth bothering with. We found good places in Victoria to have a proper breakfast but of course you have effectively bumped up the price of your room. The problem with this hotel is that it simply isn't of 3-star category. It doesn't have any of the basic facilities you would expect of a 3-star hotel and the room and breakfast were well below the standard expected. The only aspect of this hotel which was 3-star level was the price.Finally, when we checked out, I had to ask for the receipt when in all 3-star hotels I have previously stayed at, this procedure was automatic.", "Date": "August 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cSlightly dissapointed, nice location but very dated\u201d", "Author": "heartsofoak1974", "ReviewID": "UR31614954", "Content": "Room facilities are, at best, average.......rooms were very small and the decor very antiquated.

I booked through the hotel. Three nites cost me $387.00 which isn't all that bad, or was it??? It was a B&B and the lobby was small as most are; not a problem here; used to that. When I opened the door, I knew I was in trouble when the door hit the twin bed. Upon entering the room I set my suitcase on the bed as there was no other place to put it if I was to close the door. The bedding (blanket, coverlet were filthy. The curtains were at one time white sheer, but not were grey and opaque from the dirt. There was a tiny table and chair( which was so filthy I used plastic bags as a chair cover both seat and back) in the room with a TV on it; so therefore no place to put even my eyeglasses. I believe the room was once without a bathroom and they plunked one right in the middle of the room. The nicest part was the bathroom, toilet, sink and shower. However, I had to buy bleach to rid the tub of mold. The carpet was so badly stained and moth eaten that I used one of my two towels on the floor so as not to step on it. After spending two hours cleaning the place with bleach, disinfectant, I felt I could sleep in the room; after all it was only for 3 nites and I was gone mostly during the day. Well another lessoned learned.....gee, maid for a day on vacation.... Note, this hotel had no reviews, I just went by what I read in the tourist guide and on the website.. Big mistake.

We stayed here in August, and there was no Air Con- Very warm but we had fans supplied. The Bathroom was tiny, with a towel covering some kind of pipes near the floor- disgusting! Place needed a good hoover- very dusty. There was no mirrors at all in the bedroom, so after a shower you had to wait for the mirrors to de-mistfy- not grt when 3 girls are sharing!! Arriving back after a hard days shopping it wasn't great to find a black bag of rubbish ( from all the other bedrooms) in the middle of our room. We also noticed we had got 2 clean towels between the three of us. One of which we had to ask to be changed because it was dirty. When we asked at reception for sufficient towels, we got the reply; \" Oh, you want clean towels every morning?'- considering it was August, and we were taking at least 2 showers a day.....!?!?!?! Check out is at 10am- which sucks. Our phone rang at 10.05am- telling us to check out. When we left at 10.20am , the whole family- (Granny, Granddad, etc!!!) was standing outside our room- staring at us, big time. Would not recommend this place, nor would I ever stay here again!!
