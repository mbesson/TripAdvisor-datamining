It was tolerable, certainly not the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. But there were a lot of flaws. To start with, they charge a rest fee of about $15. I know these fees are prevalent in Las Vegas, but that's minus one star right off the bat. It's simply a dishonest business practice and I wish the Nevada attorney general would do something about it. Second, they charge $15 a day for Internet (- another .5 stars). Any large American hotel billing itself as a luxury property should offer Internet access for little or no extra cost. And, the hotel also charged taxes of $30 a day that weren't disclosed on the Groupon I used. So in total we ended up paying something like $60 a day for stuff that should have been included in the room rate. As far as the hotel itself, the room was nice, but there were not enough elevators. Sometimes it took 5+ minutes for one to arrive and other times when one did arrive it was full. And the hotel had a really fratty feeling. Good if you're 19 and on spring break I guess, but not for everyone else. Also, the amenities are very sparse compared to other big Vegas hotels in terms of places to eat and stores. And of course the hotel's location isn't very central.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPalms place stay in march 2012\u201d", "Author": "VanDesigner", "ReviewID": "UR126888446", "Content": "Stayed at the Palms place, but had booked at the palms tower and was upgraded to a studio suite on the 51st floor with a great view of the strip. Palms place is a nice, newer hotel that is quieter than the other towers of the Palms. It has all the benefits of the palms but Minus the casino (a bonus to us... Less smoke and less casino noise). The sky walk connects the Palms place to the casino and is not a far walk, maybe 3 min, but the elevator to the skywalk is slower than mud and adds to the journey. Staying at the palms in general, You will be paying extra for taxi rides, we estimated an extra $45 a day ($12 one way to the strip). So you will want to make sure you are getting a great deal to stay here. The shuttle does not run frequently so we didn't find it easy to use. Staff was friendly, except at ghost bar where bartenders had some serious attitude. Staying here we had comp'd entry to the bars so we left their attitudes and moved on. The rooms are nicely designed, but ours had some serious wear and tear. Sad that the upkeep of their new property is not a priority.

I can't talk it up enough. We were on the 36th floor, and we overlooked the Vegas Strip. At night, we had an amazing view of the city lights. There was a fireplace in the room, and since it happened to actually be cold while we were in town, the fireplace was very handy. The features and furniture was all very modern and contemporary, up to date, and chic. The room felt very high-class, with beautiful hardwood floors and marble bathrooms. The shower had double nozzles, and there was a separate half-bath as well. As for sleeping arrangements, there was a comfortable king sized bed as well as a pull-out full/queen sized couch bed. The beds were comfortable, given, the pull out bed was only as comfortable as a pull out bed can be (meaning it's not the most comfortable place to sleep, but it works). Also, the room came with a full kitchen- we had a refrigerator, freezer, pantry, plates and silverware. This came in very handy as we were able to keep snacks, drinks, and water in the room with us. This helped to not have to spend as much money on food, and we never had to go searching for $5 water bottles. The room was amazing, and when compared to other rooms/suites of the similar size and amenities, the price is appropriate. For the Bachelorette Party, there were quite a few girls coming and going, and this room was accommodating to everyone. We got the best deal for our dollar with this room. I rate the room ***** 5 Stars! Thoughts on service: I am also very impressed by the customer service at the hotel. We drove up Saturday and when we called about an early check in, there was a little bit of a mix up. However, when we arrived to check in, we had to wait, but the front desk got our room ready as fast as possible, and we only had to wait an hour. Considering the miscommunication, I felt that the front desk was extremely helpful and nice. The bell boys were also very friendly and accommodating. They were quick to help, and we never had to wait long for our car or a cab. When we asked for help to and from the room, the service was very quick, and again the bell hops were always friendly and eager to help. We did have to call housekeeping from time to time, and they were also helpful and the service was quick. We had no problem getting extra towels or blankets (Like I said, it was very cold the weekend we were there). The service was fantastic all around, I rate the service ***** 5 Stars! Thoughts on the Location: The Good: The good thing about the location of Palms Place is that it is connected to the Palms Casino. There is an indoor tunnel that leads from the elevators of Palms Place to the casino floor of the Palms. This made it convenient and easy to get to the Palms food court, movie theater, casino, and all the clubs in the Palms. The Bad: The Palms Place Hotel and the Palms Casino are located off the strip, too far to walk (especially for girls in cute shoes and high heels). It is not easy, or cheap, to get to the main Vegas strip. There is not a regular shuttle to take guests to the strip. Guests have to then pay for a cab or a limo, and as you can imagine, this really adds up in Vegas. Since I was with a larger party, we couldn't all fit in 1 cab, so it was either split up or take a more expensive limo. The far location from the strip is my NUMBER 1 complaint, which would not be a big deal if either the hotel or the casino had a regular shuttle. This is a major failing for the Palms. While the Palms is a fantastic casino, the location is not ideal. I rate the location ** 2 Stars. I think that I have covered all the main points. The Hotel itself is amazing, the rooms are fantastic, the service is wonderful. However, without a convenient shuttle to the main Vegas strip, the hotel really drops the ball. My overall rating for the Palms Place Hotel is *** 3 Stars (honestly, if they had a regular shuttle, this would be 4.5-5 stars).", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cPalms Place is First Class all the way!\u201d", "Author": "MNVikings2011", "ReviewID": "UR126280738", "Content": "I want to preface this review by stating that I've stayed at many hotels in Vegas (10 different to be exact with this being my 11th) and the Palms Place impressed me. If you have a strip view suite in the higher floors you have an amazing view of the strip. On the property (connected to Palms) there are many restaurants, bars, and good nightlife. You get free cover to the Ghost Bar, Moon, Rain, Playboy Club, and other clubs/bars/lounges for staying there. There are, however, a couple small downfalls to this hotel but the good outweighs the bad and it's not even close. We'll start with the good. Good: Palms Place is a newer trendy all suite and condo tower connected to the main Palms Casino/Resort. I enjoyed the modern decorations, the cleanliness of the hotel and the staff. The studio suite (inexpensive) is very nice. It has an all stainless steel kitchen. It includes, 2 fridges (one for mini bar and one for personal use that has a large icemaker built in - huge plus), dishwasher, and 2 burner stoves. Also, though, the cupboards come stocked with plates, cups, silverware, etc. The bathroom is also nice, the bed is comfy, and it has 3 plasma TV's including two that are roughly 50\". There is also a balcony but you will find more about that below. All in all, I really enjoyed this hotel and their suites. Bad: This whole tower is non smoking and that I do not mind. However, the balconies are locked for non owners because of prior morons who have stayed there launching beer bottles, cigarette butts, etc. off their balcony and now they lock them. So although you have a wonderful balcony you can only look at it through window. Also, it is a bit of a walk to the main casino. They do have the moving sidewalks that helps though. If those two things don't bother you, then you will love this place.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "cepedare", "ReviewID": "UR126068856", "Content": "I stayed at Palms Place from wed - sun for business and took some time for personal. the accomodations was incredible.

The lo-key Palms Place is one of the new fads Vegas has run away with. The non-smoking / non-gaming all suite hotel. I must say, I loved having a lot of space in our room with a kitchenette and not having to breathe in a cloud of smoke all weekend. We had to wait a while at the front desk before checking in, i didn't notice it but my boyfriend assured me someone said they would be right with us. The room had a nice modern feel and lot's of lighting. (which is usually lacking in Vegas hotels). The elevators are a little slow, but once we got up to our room on the 30th floor, the view alone was worth the wait. I have never had a view this great in Las Vegas. Palms Place is connected to the main Palms casino through a sky bridge and is also just a quick walk outside. There was a lounge in the lobby of Palms Place, but it seemed just like a stopping place before people headed out on the town for the evening. There was also a little store as well...I never went in but was comforted that it was there. Being off strip has it's advantages, we could park right in front of the hotel in an outdoor lot and not have to deal with valet or a multi-story parking garage. Getting around town was also easy because we could avoid traffic on the strip. Back to the room..the bed was So comfy and there were 3 TV's in the room. I couldn't get the TV in the bathroom to work and the hardwood floor in the sleeping area was awesome to look at, but incredibly squeaky and made it difficult to sneak around haha. The carpet in the sitting area felt very soft. We were wrongly accused of smoking in our room when checking out, but the charges were quickly reversed without hassle and we were on our merry way. Next time I'm in Vegas, the Palms Place will be my first choice. Close enough the action, but also far enough away...without smoke :) Side note: all of the black jack dealers at the Palms Casino were really nice.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prescott, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cMod\u201d", "Author": "mtspace", "ReviewID": "UR125872201", "Content": "Judging from its spare, utilitarian lines and its quirky decoration this building was built in the the 1970's. It's not clear whether it was meant to typify the architectural mode of the day or lampoon it. Stainless steel kitchenettes and glass and marble bathrooms are placed near the entry. The sleeping area is in the center. A living area with low, mod furniture occupies the space by the wall-to ceiling windows. The whole wall above the bed is mirrored as if six people were sitting in the next room watching. Seemed a little creepy to me. The main light fixture is a spherical shade the size of a watermelon that looks like something out of Woody Allen's movie Sleeper. Other fixtures had dark maroon spherical shades. Again, very mod. And, did I mention that the walls in the hallways were black. Floor to ceiling. And so was the wooden plank flooring in the sleeping area. Seems like maybe the curtains were, too. Or maybe they were gray to match the walls. The closet doors had a subtle mahogany sheen. It was the only touch of color in the place and it made rooms feel dark and dead. That goes double for the lobby. It also has no windows. Or rather it has a wall of glass that looks out onto a paved area that is so deeply shaded by the hotel structure overhead that industrial lights are required during the day to make it possible to see. Just. Either way the effect is the same: the lobby's so dark and gloomy that when - on the third day of our stay - one of our party said \"meet you in the lobby at 9:00\" another said \"what lobby?\" You will likely not recognize the entrance, even if you stop and stare at it. And the rap music playing constantly will make it seem - to nearly anyone who can remember the seventies - to be a very alien place. The fellow who checked us in was a young man who was able to speak at about twice the normal clip of a New Yorker racing to catch a subway train. And did. No time was lost on pleasantries. But he got the job done. If only he had listened as fast as he talked, we would have had to repeat ourselves a little less. The elevator guardians spoke no English. But the concierge was very helpful in guiding us to a good buffet. Our rooms were deliciously quiet, squeaky clean, but not always in perfect repair. Ours reeked of deodorizer when we arrived. And when we came back from dinner at 8:30 PM someone was replacing our A/C filter. Seemed strange. The other person in our party was in a room in which the phone did not work, there was no coffee for the coffee maker hidden in the steel cabinetry, a desk light took five minutes to come on, and it seemed impossible to get a WiFi internet connection. One evening we ate at Simon's. Sitting by the windows that open onto the sixth floor pool area we enjoyed a leisurely dinner. The menu was short; but its offerings were extremely well executed. It features sushi. which was excellent, though the portions seemed small to me. The decadent chocolate cake was baked to order and served with superb french vanilla ice cream. Extremely tasty. We stayed at Palms Place because it was highly rated in triple A, and we could get rooms at $100 per night - less with Hotwire. We were just using it as a place to be picked up from on a tour of the Grand Canyon, and it was completely adequate. If you want to share hotels with patrons who drive Cadillac SUVs the color of unripe avocado flesh or Ferraris in the fire engine red it might possibly serve that purpose, too. But if you want a place with the slightest touch of warmth, most Comfort Inns could do better. It's a little remote from the strip which is where one finds the best architecture, lights, and decorations in Vegas. This does make it quiet, but it also makes it more difficult to immerse yourself it exactly the stuff that one might go to that town to experience.

I \"Won\" this room on Hot wire. I am a strictly business traveler for the most part but love the gamble of Hotwire and Priceline once in awhile. I had stayed here before and the rooms were ok, they tend to give you a Hotwire type room when you get one that way. ( By the elevator, view of parking lot, etc... ) but at least you actually get CHECKED INTO the room, unlike I did! I had work to do so I did not get to the hotel until 10:00pm to get checked in as dinner ran late. My co worker and I took all my luggage to the hotel with the intentions of taking it to my room, dropping it off and heading out for a drink. We got there and there was this longish line and we got to the back of it. There were these 4 men at the counter being waited on by a curly headed desk clerk and there was a women waiting on the others. There must have been some issue because the time it was taking was crazy! We looked at our watches and we had been in line for 45 minutes! The only line moving was the girls, but SLOWLY! We were talking so I did not mind the wait, then I realized it was 11:00! And still 5 people ahead of us. An HOUR to check in? Really? So I went to the desk and politely asked how much longer, and got an exasperated \" WHEN I AM DONE!\" Hum.. a little rude don't ya think? So we waited 5 more minutes and realized how crazy this was to be waiting this long. So we left. I had to buy a new room across town as I was exhausted by now and just wanted to sleep. Like I said, I go to Vegas 3 times a month for Business ( I'm in the Wine Biz ) and you can bet I will not be staying at PALM PLACE anytime soon! When I called \"Cassandra\" to get my money back she argued and said \" It is not our fault that you did not SHOW UP! \" Well sweet Casandra I DID show up and had someone with me to prove it. You can bet when I am in Vegas next Tues staying at Trump Condo's I will swing by to have a word with your manager. Maybe he can pull up the camera on that Tues and see what I was talking about! He will even see me leave the line and approach the desk oh so politely!

I was looking for a place that is off the strip but still has that \"Vegas\" feel to it. Upon checking in, the front desk personnel were very friendly and accomodating. I was given 2 drink vouchers for every night of my stay and valid at any Palms Bar. My room was amazing! I had a standard king size, I'm assuming all of the rooms came with the kitchenette. If you're a lone traveler (like I was) or even with a partner, their standard room is more than sufficient. An upgrade would only be advisable if you are travelling with more than 2 people and you guys want some privacy (It's Vegas after all). Having said that, the suite was clean and spacious, the bed was comfortable, and the full size refrigerator came in very handy when I picked up a bottle of wine and brought home some leftover. There were two thing I love about my room: I had an amazing view of the strip and the distant dessert and the incredible bathroom/shower/bathtub/heaven made of marble!!!! I would have brought that home with me if I could. Housekeeping was also very good, I had asked for extra towels and corksrew bottle opener and they brought it promptly. Like I said earlier I was looking for an accomodation off the strip so I was somehwat prepared to shell out a $10 cab fare one way evey time I went downtown. It's worth the peace and quiet at the end of the day though. They do have shuttle service, but I think it only runs once a day (I could be wrong). Palms place is connected to the Palms casino via air bridge so it was nice to be able to test my luck on the slot machines and just walk to my room. I signed up for a couple of spa treatments as well. I thought their spa and fitness center was sufficient. It was comfortable, clean, plush. The only negative thing about the Palms Place is the the $25 fee they charge when you use any of their spa facilities (pool, jacuzzi, steam sauna, fitness center). If you book a treatment (massage, facial, etc.) you don't have to pay; but if you just want to work out at the gym - you may do so with a fee.

The kitchen was very handy (including microwave, full refrigerator, and best thing yet, a Toaster!) even though we did order room service two or three nights as the food from the restaurant on site is excellent and not really overpriced considering that this is a very nice Hotel and we were kind of on vacation. The TV also had a DVD player and of course any movie you could possible want to see. As for the internet, the hotel supplied Wi-fi worked flawlessly. The hard wire RJ 45 system is no longer functional (even though the room purports to have it) so bring a USB Wi-fi card if your laptop or other computer device does not built in Wi-fi. Cell phone Wi-fi also worked though our phones use a regular provider. Palms Place does not have a casino which is a great things for kids...Let's be frank, 10 year olds should not be hanging around casinos but the casino of the Main Palms Hotel is easily accessible by simply walking upon a secure 2nd floor pathway. You an be in the casino in like five minutes.... Some people have complained that the elevators take a long time...not me. The elevators worked great even though we had some wind...of course, if you are trying to take an elevator at check out time, you assume your own risk in waiting or being late for some appointment!!!! So own up to it and be ahead of schedule when checking out...Check out was painless and took five seconds. Any negatives? Well, the second bathroom needed an evalauation for a water leak, something did not quite smell right but I could not locate the source...the Suite had a few light bulbs out but there is so much light from the huge windows that it was no big deal. If you do blow a fuse, there is a fuse box in the unit. There are also plenty of power plugs, something very handy for today's traveller who is always charging something, like a DS! The only Complaint if I had to stand on one is that the management should contrive some way to open the beautiful balcony doors...even if it is just a few inches to get some fresh air. Or devise a new door system such that some portion allows a guest to open a door window. Any room can be stifling without fresh air and I understand the liability and risk factor in allowing guests to access a balcony but there should be some way to come up with a solution. The air conditioner worked fine but it is just not the same as fresh air. All in all, I will stay there again and I will recommend that any large group with kids involved in sports and or sports teams stay here...assuming their kids have respect for other people's privacy and know how to behave... Our unit had a washer & dryer which was very handy as my son got sick during a game so we had to wash his jersey. The TVs were great for kids and even had the NHL Network! While we took care of ourselves, when we needed housekeeping, they were on it. The showers speak for themselves as the 3 shower faucets get even the dirtest little kid clean! Bottom line, great location, great services, great value, loved it!", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat value!\u201d", "Author": "RidingAlong", "ReviewID": "UR124786863", "Content": "Recently stayed here on a 3 day business trip.

Should you prefer to make meals in your room, you have all the necessary tools, including a two burner stovetop. The king bed was comfortable, and both the sitting area and the bedroom area each had its own flat screen. The bathroom was spacious and the shower had a rain shower head in addition to the handheld spout. A large jetted tub, plenty large enough for two was located inside the shower. The modern d\u00e9cor extends to the hallway, including the walls and carpeting. I also want to comment on the soundproofing of the rooms. One of my biggest pet peeves when traveling is paper thin walls. That wasn't the case here. I called my friends who were staying in the room next door, and I didn't even hear the phone ringing. Pretty impressive! The only negative was the distance from the Palms.

We stayed in a studio suite 15-309. Don't let them put you into this room if you have a choice. The hotel I must say is beautiful. The rooms are cozy, so cozy because of the rooms terrible lighting. Don't plan on reading in there unless it is during the day and you are sitting by the window so you can get the daylight to hit your pages. The main reason I say don't let them put you in room 15-309 is that when the wind is blowing it creates an annoying sound like a finger going around the ring of a glass. This noise is loud and never stops. Along with that noise, we could hear a dog barking and barking and barking 2 rooms down from us. The shower has a dual shower head: one rain shower head on the ceiling and a arm shower head on the wall. The arm shower head's metal shower cord was broken and the water sprayed all over the bathroom. When I say all over, that is an understatement! The water covered the entire bathroom, the floor and the walls and the mirror. The water went every where.Even the toilet paper roll got soaked. I had my clothes in the bathroom to change into, well soaked also! I could not wear that outfit. The bathroom mat was so wet that it did not dry in the 3 days that we were there. I have to say the bathroom is a decent size , . It has a television in it. It also has a lighted makeup mirror on the wall. That did not work. In the living room the outlet cover was laying on the floor by the main column light. i did not touch it, but the outlet that it was supposed to be on, worked some times and not other times. This resulted in the column light going on and off every so often. When it did not work the room became even darker. Ugh, There i s no hotel information book in the room. You really need one because the hotel is set up that if you want to go someplace you have to take an elevator to get there. It was hard to figure out what the hotel had to offer. I did go to the front desk at one point to ask to be moved to another room. I was told that that was not an option, I said I would gladly pay for an upgrade. That also was not an option that the hotel was sold out. I said then can we change rooms and be put at the Palms. They said that the could not do that. Isn't the Palms Place the 3rd tower to the Palms hotel? So why could they not move us someplace. Don't hotels have extra rooms even when they are sold out just for situations like mine? I am pretty sure they do. But, not a hundred percent true. When I went to the front desk to tell them of the barking dog, the annoying wind noise ect. I was offered a late check out. That was nice and all, but why stay longer than I already was? The kitchen which we did not use, does comes fully furnished with dishes, pots and pans etc. That is a plus, you don't find that option at The Planet Hollywood condos. The front door man was great, he had the door open for you before you could even get your hand out to open the door. He was always very cheerful. The food at Simons was good.We had breakfast. Room service was great. No complaints. Very fast service. I go to Las Vegas 3 times a year. I am not sure if I would stay here again. There is a shuttle that takes you to the strip 2 times a day. Not good, the Rio across the street has shuttles all day long. You may wait 20 minutes max there. My husband has wanted to stay at the Palms Place since it opened. We could have stayed at a Harrahs property for free with the our players club points but decided to pay to stay at the Palms Place. I think that is what was the most disappointing part of the whole trip. We had so many issues and then had to pay a pretty penny for those issues when we could have stayed at Caesars Palace or Planet Hollywood for free. If you want to gamble this tower does not have a casino so if you want to gamble you better put on some good walking shoes, because it is a decent walk. Just to let you know allow your self a few extra minutes to your walk for elevator use. In the sky tube there is only one elevator to the casino and depending on what time of the day it is you may find yourself waiting for the elevator. I don't know if I would give it another try to find out that the other rooms may or may not have the wind noise etc. I hope this helps, Niki Cokins", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cA little disappointed...\u201d", "Author": "taylortrio", "ReviewID": "UR123471851", "Content": "We stayed in a studio suite on the 22nd floor.

Along with another couple of properties, it's at the top of my preferences and I stayed there at least 4 or 5 times. Immediately after opening it was largely overpriced (I still remember a first days 449$ nt regular rate 449$ in 1bdrm suite), now weekday rate is consistent with similar room in comparable hotel. As you probably know, it's not on the strip (a mile or so away) and it's a condo style hotel with no casino (although a short covered walkway brings you directly at Palms casino). Relax and no crowd it's a must here, but still it's a \"hip\" hotel so folks are often young and glamorous crowding lobby bar and pool restaurant in the night. I always stay in a 1 bdrm suite. Only once I stayed in a regular studio and was not disappointed. But in my opinion the real breaking amenity is the jacuzzi bath tub in the bedroom, perfectly adjacent to floor to ceiling windows. You can easily soak inside while sipping a glass of wine (very romantic if you are there with your loved one), enjoying bubbles and watching Las Vegas strip lights. Other than this, everything is in modern style. One of the most beautiful bathroom I've ever seen, featuring a shower so large a basket team could fit inside at the same time, a kitchenette with microwave, fridge and so on, two large HD plasma tv and a great strip view being your room on the right side (mountain side is not that bad, either). One bad point: on my last two visits balconies were closed. I asked about at the lobby, they said it was a liability reason. I really can't understand the sense of building so large balconies and keeping them closed.

The off-the-strip location was bittersweet; it was nice to be in the quiet, though there was a night we were too lazy to get a cab, so decided to just eat at N9ne, rather than elsewhere. If you want to just get out and walk around to get some air or people-watch, Palms inhibits that possibility. Speaking of N9ne: don't waste your money! The steaks are over-seasoned, over-priced, and lackluster at best. The meal was fine, but I want more than \"fine\" when I'm paying for \"amazing\". I had a better meal for half the price at Serendipity! The crowd (guests & staff) were a bit on the pretentious side: like they were hired to look pretty, but not much else. Our questions (though few) were answered, but not in a \"we're here to help\" sort of way; more of a \"you're on my catwalk\" manner. This hotel is definitely for the \"pretty\" ones: not ashamed to see or be seen in attire that is unnecessarily (albeit purposely) revealing.

First of all, we booked the tan, liquor, spa package and found upon checking in that we still had to pay a $15 resort fee (EVERYONE does, which BTW is actually $16.80 with tax, and gets the liquor credit); the \"tan\" is two sessions (for our three night stay) of no more than 12 minutes each; and the spa is only open from 11-7, so you have to go when you are otherwise occupied doing something fun, like out on the strip. Oh and if you do want to take their shuttle to the strip, there are only two: 10am and 5pm, and there is no return shuttle for the 5pm drop off. There is basically nothing around The Palms, but it is peaceful if that's what you want. The room has a full kitchen, which you can actually cook in, but we were told not to store anything in the refrigerator as housekeeping may throw it out. There is a mini-bar, but don't touch anything as the sensors will charge your room for items you just pull out to look at. The pool closed down for the season the day we arrived, so eating at Simon's Restaurant, which everyone raved about, seemed pointless since there was nothing to look at from their windows but a bunch of pool equipment. Our main criticism though was the cleanliness of our room. On Saturday we called housekeeping three times throughout the day for towels and a few things, like cleaning the filthy floor, and then when no one showed up we called the front desk. Finally they sent someone up sometime while we were eating dinner. The next day we put up the \"housekeeping service sign\" first thing in the morning and when we returned to our room at 6pm it was still a mess. We found a maid down the hall cleaning another room and asked if she would be coming to ours - she said \"no.\" \"What?\" we asked...and she said that they were told to only clean certain rooms on certain days. I called the front desk again and they said they were sorry, but the least they could have done was offer us some small incentive for our trouble - even Starbucks gives you a free drink coupon when they screw up. But this was more than that; this was insulting to find out that they purposely don't clean rooms, even if you request it that day. I have traveled all around the world and have never been treated this way. Additionally, I feel that the package and the pictures were a misrepresentation of reality.

We were told unless we upgraded to a penthouse suite for $1200-$2500/ night we couldn't get two beds. This was a deal breaker for next time.

The layout of the pool and spa are really great and I would love to return to these areas. The cabanas are reasonably priced ($150 for a Friday). As for the service, I thought it was really good. However, the hotel seems to have a very unclear (to put it mildly) policy on tipping. Although a 20% gratuity is automatically added to mostly everything (including cabanas, spa treatments, etc.) the bill they give you at the end does not mention the automatic inclusion, notes only the final cost, and leaves a blank for the gratuity (which basically invites you to double tip). As I thought 20% was sufficient, I did not add an additional gratuity and noticed that the staff seemed somewhat disappointed. It is a strange policy and really the only negative mark on what is otherwise a really great property with an awesome party scene. As for the resort fee, it is pretty commonplace but make sure to get the $20 drink credit and $30 spa credit, which makes up for it. The Palms Place is not for families or for those who want that whole classical luxury feel (like let's say Bellagio).

Pros: Spacious one bedroom suite with living room, kitchen (with no pots or pans, so what\u2019s the point), One and a half bathrooms, jet whirlpool in bedroom (amazing, best one I\u2019ve ever used), and great views (floor to ceiling windows all around). The hotel was pretty empty, which was great, but then also makes me wonder, why? Valet guys were super nice and accommodating. Parking lot was very close to the front entrance which saved a lot of time. Most hotels in Vegas would take you 10 \u2013 15 minutes to get to your car. Cons: No staff. I would call the concierge and no one would pick up the phone. I would call the front desk and it would ring at least 50 \u2013 60 times before I would either hang up or someone would finally pick up. The concierge was extremely rude and wanted nothing to do with helping us find a club to go to. He was from England or something, just wanted to point that out, so that maybe the Palms will know who I am referring to. The room was very big and modern, BUT, the damage in the room was ridiculous. Holes in the walls, wallpaper peeling off, cereal and crumbs under the couch, speaker broken off of the t.v., handles broken in the main shower, t.v. reception sucked, no pots or pans in the kitchen which to me is NOT a state of the art kitchen, as they would describe on their website. Why offer a stove to your customers when you don\u2019t provide pots or pans. Do they actually think people are travelling with these things\u2026.give me a break. The hotel was unstaffed, and rundown. I called for an extra blanket the first night and they told me they had run out\u2026\u2026excuse me, like what do you even say to that. Ran out of blankets, but this is your business, providing your customers with comfort while they sleep\u2026.that was confusing. No one even apologized for it, they could have cared less. Here\u2019s a little tip, Pamls, send one of your worker\u2019s to go and buy a couple extra blankets at Walmart if you\u2019re that in need, it\u2019s really not that difficult. Another tip, if you\u2019re going to charge people for damage, why don\u2019t you try fixing it with the money you charged them, so the next customer doesn\u2019t have to experience it. The elevators, well, let\u2019s just say that was a chore\u2026.getting your key to actually work was comical. I couldn\u2019t even believe how inefficient that was. Great idea, if it actually worked. And really, it\u2019s for security, you have one elevator that you don\u2019t even need a key for. It will allow you to travel to any floor you want. As for the security on the main floor asking patrons to see their room keys, what a joke, you\u2019re just misleading your customers in actually believing their safe, when in all reality, someone can just take the skytube (2nd floor) over from the palms casino and jump right on an elevator free and clear\u2026.no questions asked. Extremely poor setup and completely inefficient. I also loved how they were telling people who had just arrived that their elevators were experiencing NO problems. What a bunch of liars, I had already been there a week and there was nothing BUT problems the whole week, and they were quite aware of it. The pool at the Palms Place was a complete JOKE. They have about 60 lawn chairs for people to sit on in total, however, they only have about 10 for free and if those 10 are already taken, it\u2019s going to cost you. They don\u2019t give those out for free\u2026..yes, you read that right, they actually have the audacity to charge their own customers to sit down on a chair at the pool. I couldn\u2019t even believe it, what\u2019s next, are they going to start charging people to walk down the hall?\u2026.unbelievable. The only good thing about this place, was leaving. It\u2019s 100% going down the tubes and I don\u2019t give it much longer (maybe a couple years) before they close the doors or turn it into a 2 star stratosphere hotel. They are obviously coming into some hard times, at least I would hope so, considering how they treat their hotel and their customers.

Picking the Palms Place for my 30th birthday celebration was a carefully calculated decision and it was a success in some ways, but a major disappointment in one big way. With a group of 30+ people, I knew I wanted a hotel that was smaller and would be easy to have my friends nearby. The Palms Place was perfect for this. Everything from the lobby to the pool to the bar made it easy to meet up and run into friends throughout the course of the weekend. My friends loved the modern touches and the friendly pool staff. The problem was with our 2 bedroom suite which was really two different hotel rooms \"connected.\" On-line, this suite is advertised as 1,800 square feet and cost us $700 per night. We thought it would be a perfect room to host my welcome cocktail party on Friday night and entertain guests. And while it worked, it was not what was advertised or made to believe what it was. It consists of a 1-Bedroom Suite and a Studio Suite with 2 closing doors leading to the main floor hallway. There are two different room numbers and does not give the feel that you are in a 2-Bedroom Suite. Our cocktail party never left the 1-Bedroom Suite, as being in the Studio Suite would have been a different party altogether. Additionally, had we have booked a 1-Bedroom Suite and a Studio Suite seperately, we would have saved $150 per night at time of booking. This did not make me a happy hotel guest. When we brought up our concerns to the front desk, the hotel representative was a tad bit argumentative and didn't seem too concerned with our complaint. She then confirmed that had we booked seperately, it would have been cheaper, but we \"pay a premium\" to have the rooms side-by-side.

The trip over to the Palms on the moving walkway really is not that bad. I saw a lot of complaints in the reviews but do not share their views. The Palms has seen better days and at this point is all about the Pauly D/MTV scene. The gambling scene is pretty week and the table games are limited. They're the only major hotel that doesn't have Let It Ride which was a disappointment because they advertised having it on their website. I was told they dropped it because it didn't make them enough money. We had a good time seeing Paul van Dyk at Rain. The restaurants are decent but there are less options than most Strip hotels. And of course you are far from the Strip. All in all, I got a good rate that made it a good value. But being bumped was disappointing and the Palms has lost some of its luster.

We stayed in Room 28-320, a corner unit suite on the 28th floor looking at the strip. Upon arriving at our building's entrance there really was no pomp and circumstance that you experience in a typical hotel, the lobby and check in desk are simple, fairly small and elegant. Check in concierge personnel are very friendly and extremely helpful. There is a longe/bar in the lobby as well. When we arrive on our floor, it's dark, quiet and modern. The hallway evidently needs some vacuuming (against a dark carpet you can see everything) and the windows in the elevator bay could use some windex. I did so much research on the hotel and viewing pictures that there was no tremendous surprise in opening the door (but a view of the strip sure makes it more special!). The notable short comings in the room were as follows: - The veneer facing on the cabinets/entertainment center lining the wall under the TVs was torn/chipped/peeled in some areas - The kitchen sink faucet was not caulked properly so it leaned and flopped around quite a bit - The battery to our safe died half way through our stay - The television reception was terribly sketchy, may have been digital and received alot of interference (on both TVs in living room), thus we never watched TV during our stay - The complimentary breakfast ended by 9 am (starts at 7), we were incorrectly told it ended at 10 am, but it essentially only served muffis, juice and coffee, so it was no big loss for us - I read this before, but still worth noting, though the rooms have balconies, they doors to them are locked thus inaccessible - Fair distance from the strip, depending on any traffic, you're going to spend $8-$12 on a cab ride to the Caesars/Bellagio/Gambling Bill's intersestion (about a 5-8 minute ride away) For what it lacked in maintenance though, it makes up for in ammeneties and service: - Aveda tioletries - Incredible bed! I couldn't imagine why people raved about the comfort of a bed until I slept in it. It's worth all lauding it gets - Quiet building, its a good reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the adjacent Palms Casino and the rest of the din on the Strip - SkyTube makes getting to the Palms Casino and clubs VERY convenient; there are moving walkways, keeps you out of the blistering sun and there is music playing everywhere. I don't think it was more than a 3 minute walk using the walkways - $20 per day beverage credit at the casino bars - Free access to Palms Place Pool (subdued/chill) or Palms Pool (party scene) for guests of any of the Palms towers - VIP card for all access to all Palms clubs given to you upon your first club visit - Some of the best clubs in Vegas, if for nothing else THE VIEWS!!! - Get a Palms Club card, gets you discounts to one of the most ample and cheapest buffets in Vegas (Bistro Buffet) - Palms definitely has the loosest slots in Vegas, I won $300 on the penny machines in one sitting. As a matter of fact, I never really lost any time I played the slots (even if I only won a few dollars) I'm really never one to complain about any place I visit because it's all about the visitor's perception, however, the items I mentioned as cons I think are worth noting to anyone that's considering staying here. Palms place is about a 20 minute ride from McCarran airport and will run you about $25 with tip. I'd say the main highlights are as follows: - Playboy Club is posh you should visit - Moon is upstairs from Playboy club and has some great terraces to view the strip (great music play as well) - Bistro Buffet is the way to go, no better deal and selection anywhere. Though we also ate at Little Buddha and Gardunos as well, and are worth hitting at least for the ambiance - Palms Casino has the best slots, hands down - Great place to potentially spot celebrities. We met Daniel Negreanu at one of the Palms Casino bars while he was in town for the Epic Poker event Last but not least, book your entire trip through JetBlue Getaways, our hotel stay and round trip flight cost less collectively than airfare alone and was the best deal going on the internet (not to mention you get JetBlue points for both your hotel stay and airfare).

This was our third trip to Las Vegas. Ten years ago, I stayed in a suite in the Palms tower just after it first opened. We booked the travel package through Travelocity and got an unbelievably low price for four nights in a \u201cdeluxe\u201d (read: standard) room in the original Palms tower. When we arrived, we asked the front desk clerk if we could upgrade to a studio suite in the newer PalmsPlace tower. Even with the upgrade, the room charge was only $100 per night plus tax\u2026for a contemporary suite on the 51st floor with a spectacular view of the Las Vegas skyline! Overall, our experience was influenced by two main factors: (1) We stayed during the week. By doing so, we received a much lower rate and our pick of rooms. Even though we arrived on a holiday (Monday, July 4th), the resort was not crowded. It wasn\u2019t dead either -- just the right level of people and activity for us. We would not have enjoyed this stay as much if it was overrun with people and more expensive, as can occur on the weekends. (2) The ambience of the PalmsPlace matched what we were looking for: contemporary, hip and sexy. The whole place exudes this feel, from the architecture, art and room design, to the music, the pool area and Simon\u2019s Restaurant, to the casino and fabulous nightclubs. If that is the vibe you are looking for, you\u2019ll love it here. On the other hand, if you are looking for staid classical elegance, this is not the right fit. And while we saw some families here, this place is not designed for kids. Before booking this hotel, we read hundreds of reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews of this resort told us what to look out for and helped us avoid some of the problems experienced by others. Pros- The Studio Suite: The main webpage of the PalmsPlace has a photo of the suite we stayed in, showing the same view. Go to www.palms.com, and then choose the PalmsPlace link at the very top of the page. The skyline view is even better when you\u2019re sitting on the sectional sofa near the windows. Not shown in the picture are the all-stainless-steel kitchenette and the spacious bathroom with floor-to-ceiling marble tiles, contemporary glass shower and hot tub. The bathroom is amazing. Outside of a few minor flaws mentioned below, the room was spacious, well designed and clean. Another plus is that the PalmsPlace tower is non-smoking, and the ventilation and A/C system worked well. The PalmsPlace Pool and Simon\u2019s Lounge/Restaurant: The pool area looks like the pictures on the website \u2013 perhaps even nicer in person. Free towels are provided and there is a poolside bar. Drinks by the pool are a bit pricey, but not ridiculously so ($6 for a beer, $10 for a glass of wine.) The whole experience was very relaxing. Unlike the other Palms pool, which has a louder party scene, the PalmsPlace pool is quieter, more laid back \u2013 and very sexy. We highly recommend Happy Hour at Simon\u2019s, where all drinks and appetizers are only $6. It\u2019s adjacent to the pool, and the ambience is great. Ghostbar, Moon and Playboy Club: These clubs are worth experiencing, even if only for the views. The Ghostbar, located on top of the original Palms tower, has a near panoramic view of Las Vegas. We were there on July 4th to watch the fireworks. Believe it or not, the fireworks displays were dwarfed by the normal lights coming from the strip! Moon also has nice views, but is primarily a loud dance club frequented by 20-something singles. To bolster the upper end of the age demographic, we got out there and danced too! Playboy Club is best suited for those who like table games, where the dealers are gorgeous Playboy Bunnies. Life is tough! To get into these clubs at low or no cost and skip the lines, make sure you ask for VIP passes when you check in or get onto Chris Hornack\u2019s guest list www.freevegasclubpasses.com We found his service to be great \u2013 just send him a text. It\u2019s free. The Palms Casino: When we weren\u2019t eating, lounging by the pool or hitting the nightclubs, we were playing the slot machines in the Palms Casino (and the Gold Coast, which is directly across the street). As advertised, both had friendly slots and are frequented by locals. The waitresses on the Palms Casino floor provided excellent service in bringing us free drinks while we played. It also didn\u2019t hurt that every one of them was drop-dead gorgeous! We tipped them $1 per drink. Unlike the Palms, the Gold Coast is decidedly non-sexy \u2013 it caters more to retirees. But we enjoyed the slot play there as well and earned two free buffet dinners. Package Extras: On check-in, we received vouchers for two free breakfast buffets at the Palms Casino, four $20 per day drink credits at the casino bars, a free bottle of liquor, two VIP passes for free entry to the nightclubs, and free entry passes to the fitness center. Cons- Real and Perceived Resort Fees: Along with the room charge, the PalmsPlace resort charges a $15/night resort fee ($16.80 including tax). We knew this going in \u2013 so it wasn\u2019t a surprise. Many resorts in Las Vegas are now charging this extra fee; apparently the Palms started charging it a few months ago. In light of the low room rate and fabulous amenities we received, we didn\u2019t mind too much. However, if you wish to use the fitness center, it is located inside the spa, and access is not automatically included in the resort fee! We avoided this problem by asking the front desk clerk on check-in; he gave us free passes to the fitness center. Room wear and tear (minor): Some of the wood veneer furniture was chipped in a few spots, exposing the particle board underneath. Also, the paint along the edges of the dark brown door was chipped from people banging their luggage against it. A bit of cosmetic patchwork by the PalmsPlace maintenance staff would go a long way to fix these problems and return the room to top condition. Hallway area: The d\u00e9cor in the hallways is dark brown. While we liked it and thought it was sexy, the dark color scheme had a way of exposing dust along the baseboards and edges of the rugs. The hallways would look better if someone went through with a vacuum cleaner crevice tool and some touch up paint. (Unlike the hallways, our room was not dark and was nicely cleaned.) Table service in nightclubs: Another unfortunate trend in Las Vegas is that you have to pay exorbitant prices to find a place to sit at nightclubs. Again, we knew this going in, primarily because of Chris Hornack\u2019s informative website. Rather than pay for table service, we just found a good railing to set our drinks on \u2013 and enjoyed the spectacular views! SkyTube: Some of the reviews we read complained of the walk between the Palms Casino area and the PalmsPlace tower. We did not find this to be a problem at all and enjoyed the short 2-3 minute walk. It\u2019s a nice transition from the noisier casino. Even the SkyTube\u2019s ambience is sexy! Off strip location: While some others complained about this, there are several options to get to the strip: (1) take the free shuttle bus from the Gold Coast to Bills, which is mid strip, (2) take the 202 city bus, which runs along west Flamingo Blvd. The bus stop is right in front of the main entrance to the Palms casino, (3) take a short cab ride costing about $8-10, or (4) Walk, if you are really adventurous, not wearing heels and it is daylight. It\u2019s about \u00be mile to the strip, but you have to cross a very busy interchange with I-15; possible, but not recommended. We had such a good time in and around the Palms, we never made it to the strip. (We had been to the strip on prior trips.) Tips for enjoying your stay- --Stay during the week, if possible, to get the best deals --Book a basic room, and then ask for an upgrade after you get there (unless it\u2019s a busy time period). You can get a great upgrade at little or no cost at the last minute when the hotel is not fully booked. You have more flexibility if you book directly with the hotel. --When you check in, hand the desk clerk a $20 bill folded up underneath your credit card. He/she will be more inclined to get you the best deals on room upgrades, VIP and fitness center passes, etc. Then don\u2019t be afraid to ask for what you want! --Speaking of cards, use a credit card, not a debit card, when you check in. The Palms automatically holds a $100 per night security deposit on your card. If you use a debit card, you funds will be tied up for days afterward. (We learned this the hard way while staying at a Washington, DC hotel.) Also, tell the desk clerk that you won\u2019t use the minibar, and he/she may knock that security deposit down by half. --Speaking of the minibar, don\u2019t touch it or move the items around, unless you want to be charged. The items sit on a pressure sensor, which automatically adds charges to your bill when you touch them. We avoided this problem by not going into the minibar at all. Our studio suite had a separate refrigerator which we used for food and drink items. Don\u2019t use the minibar fridge for that purpose! --You can keep dining costs down by buying some groceries. There\u2019s a grocery store about a half mile or so west on W. Flamingo and a convenience store closer than that, within walking distance. There\u2019s a Starbucks and some fast food places nearby as well. The 202 bus can take you to the grocery store. --Be sure you get on guest lists for free or low cost entry and line skip passes to the nightclubs. Otherwise, you may have huge cover charges and have to wait in long lines. Chris Hornack will set you up at no cost.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice for guys trip to Vegas.\u201d", "Author": "smu09", "ReviewID": "UR114906723", "Content": "Me and 5 friends decided to book a room at the Palms Place for Memorial Day Weekend. We got a 2 bedroom suite for around $500/night. The room was huge and amazing. 2 very large and comfortable queen beds, 2 large couches that were supposedly pull-out queens, but we never got around to it. What can I say....it was Vegas, and everyone simply passed out where there was space available. We got an excellent high floor room with stunning views of the strip. The white marble bathrooms were excellent; with good water pressure and temperature, and good Aveda toiletries. The refrigerator with freezer, ice-maker, and glasses was great for keeping all our beer and liquor cold, and basically providing us with a wet bar. We made drinks in the room before going out each night, and it saved us a lot of $$. I recommend stopping at a liquor store on the way to your hotel, and putting whatever you buy in your luggage (not sure of hotel policy on bringing in booze). The televisions all had HD ESPN, which was about all we really needed to kill time in the afternoon. Only weird thing was the placement of the tub in the middle of the room next to a window. Might be nice if this was a condo you owned as they intended, but awkward and unnecessary for a guys trip. The service at the hotel was a little lacking, and they tended to nickel and dime you. I was charged for a toothbrush(!!!!), and they tried to charge me for a disposable razor and a tiny can of crappy shaving cream. Didn't really appreciate that. The location off the strip really wasn't too bad.....it's already hot in Vegas, and we weren't planning on doing any walking, regardless of where we stayed. Cabs are cheap and plentiful. Worst part about the hotel is the elevators. They take incredibly long to call, and even longer to get to the bottom floor. It became almost comical, as they stopped basically every floor. We went to the pool all day one day, and had an awesome time. The crowd was pretty entertaining, lots of Ed Hardy types making fools of themselves. All my friends eventually found plenty of flirty, cute girls to talk to. Drinks were about $11, which was expensive, but not outrageous by Vegas standards. D.J. playing the pool party was pretty good as well. Getting chairs is near impossible, but we found a group that allowed us to stash our stuff under their lounge chairs. Overall, we had a good experience at the Palms Place.

The remote control for the TV was not working, but for us this was not a problem at all. We weren't looking to spend time watching TV anyway. Oh and one more thing. I did notice our coffee cups were left around the room after it was cleaned. No big deal really. There were new ones in our cabinet. For those that do not know, there are several clubs/lounges in the Palms hotel which is adjoined by a tunnel/walkway so you can get right over to the casino and all the clubs/lounges no problem. If you do want to get to the strip the cab is about 12 or 13 bucks each way. Not a big deal, but i guess if you want your room to be on the strip, this is not necessarily the place for you. We ate at the restaurant Simon which was pretty good. Just had the sushi for lunch. Not terribly overpriced. Also had the lunch buffet which was only 14 or 15 bucks if you sign up for their players club program so a very good deal. Also, we did not have any issues checking out. Only valid charges appeared on our bill so no complaints there. Overall i would definately recommend this place if you are able to get a good deal.

I was staying alone and opted for the Palms Place as I had been there before and knew I would be safe on my own. Howeer I had forgotten how awful the service was and unfortunately in the year since I was there it is even worse. When I arrived at the desk to check in the lady behind asked for a credit card. Assuming it was just to swipe to hold a number in case of damages I gave her my credit card. No conversation at all and then she announces, sorry this card wont authorise the $794 Im putting through...Errr Im sorry why are you trying to charge me $794 Ive just arrived I ve not even stayed yet and my total bill is $494 for the stay. Seeming annoyed by my perfectly reasonable question she replies, Oh we charge you now and hold $100 for every night of your stay for any room service etc you may use. I tell her Im not planning to and I would rather just pay for the room for now and pay cash if I use anything else I cannot afford to have an extra $300 held on my card I had not budget for. She does not care and tells me thats the deal. So basically I go with it she assures me when I check out the actual amount I have spent will come off the card and the rest will be relised in 24 hours to my account. So now I have left the Palms and am on to my next destination, its been 4 days since I checked out. Ive checked my bank anbd they have taken only the money for the room, all good then the rest of my money must be back in my account no worrries on with the holiday!! Oh no how wrong...I run out of cash and go to a cash machine to be told I have no available funds!! Uh oh what now I call my bank to say my balance says \u00a3445 but why wont they give me any cash, they take a look....Palms Place are holding $794 on your card madam!! What so not only have they taken the $400 plus dollars from my stay through a additional transaction. They have also not relised my original $700 PLUS payment. So now I am on holiday with no money and have had to make around \u00a325 of calls from my mobile to my bank. Still trying to resolve the issue with them now to release my money as apparently no one there can help right now. This is a total disaster and is now ruining my holiday!

Finally the next morning we had $750 worth of Spa treatments booked at Drift Spa. My point is that we were not concerned about money for that night. When we first entered the room, we were blown away by the facilities and the view from the 51st floor. BTW though the suites have balconies, guests do not have access due to \"issues\". If you pay more and get a penthouse, those issues seem to disappear. At least that was the upsell at the front desk.

After all mistakes to happen! We explained the issues to the front desk and clearly heard our complaints communicated to housekeeping by the front desk. We headed off to dinner happy to know that the issues will be resolved. After dinner we returned back to the room so my wife could change her heels and freshen up for dancing and fun in the casino. Nothing had been done, but housekeeping did put new robes on the tub. No, they did not remove the old robes or take the hairs off them. They left everything exactly the same way and just gave us new robes. We did not want to complain again that night, so we decided to point it out the next day. So we had a good time out and spent quite a bit of money on expensive $15 drinks. Who cares, we are having fun! We return to our room and expect to have a great night when my wife says \" Honey I'm sorry, but all I smell is vomit on myside of the bed\". Sure enough, it smells horrible on her side of the bed. At 3:30 am we call the front desk and complain and tell them we need to move. They move us from the 51st floor to the 8th floor. We have the identical room and honestly, it was a little dusty but we were exhausted. The next morning we get up and notice we have no robes at all in this suite. We complain about our night and get $100 off as that is all the front desk is authorized to do. They told us to definitely come back and see the manger. Fine, lets have a quick bite and head to the spa for our couples massage and facials. My first facial BTW. The spa was top notch and the massage was a dream! We go back to find the manager and wait for about 15-20 min, finally the front desk gives us a couple free drinks while we wait. Finally we see the manager who offers us a couple brunches to compensate for the night. We stayed quiet but to experience a room that smelled like vomit and was dirty and then get a bill for $600 -$100 is not good enough! Regardless, we sucked it up and went home. Even after getting a negative response in the guest survey, they never offered to at a min cover the room costs. A corporate person sent me an email today saying they are dedicated to service blah blah blah and hope we will return and give them another chance. Why would I pay another $600 -$100 to go back there to potentially experience the same thing? Palms is not cheap and is off the strip, they need to be extra good to get business.

When me and a few friends check in, it was no problem! We got to our room, and everything was clean and its its place. But if you look closer they're are some things that not not right! First, when I thought this hotel getting really good I sit down on the sitting area of the living room. Next to my feet was a big puke stain on the carpet. I dont think even the cleaning crew cleaned it because it was crusty and they try to hide it under a piece of furniture! Second the tv from the living did not work, it didnt even turned on. So a repair guy or as Palms Place call them \"engineer' came in and took care of the problem quick. Third, after the engineer left we realize that our ice machine from our freezer did not make ice. So we called front desk and they told us they were sending the\"engineer\" to fix it. instead I think he gave up and told front desk to just bring us ice from room service. Also you can see the wear and tear on the walls and wooden floors. The main thing that bother me mainly was the location. Its pretty far from the strip. So I felt limited in time! They should offer a free shuttle to the strip. i felt like I missed the whole Vegas experience staying here! next time no doubt about it am staying at the strip!", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cCompletely Disappointing\u201d", "Author": "Jupitersmoon", "ReviewID": "UR103500863", "Content": "The staff here is outright incompetent and unprofessional. I booked one of the larger suites for a special occasion that I was combining with some business. I called ahead and made arrangements with the concierge to have $300 dollars worth of roses and a gift basket placed in the room, as this stay was a surprise for my companion. I even called ahead and emailed the desk staff with instructions about the roses and expressed details that this was meant to be a surprise. Well\u2026 When we arrived an hour after the hotel\u2019s scheduled check in- time, we were told that our room was not ready and that it would be about another half hour before it is. We were directed to the hotel\u2019s swank looking lobby bar and ordered two drinks. The bartender actually asked if I had drink comp tix. When I said no, she said that was ok, no charge, the desk should have given us some. But since we were literally the ONLY guests in the bar/lobby it wasn\u2019t such a big deal. I handed her $10 anyway. 45 mins later the desk agent actually SHOUTS across the lobby that our room was now ready. When we went to collect the room keys the desk agent actually looks directly at my companion and asks \u201cI think some flowers arrived for you. You want those delivered to your room?\u201d Surprise ruined! I glared at the clerk and asked her to please read the reservation notes. She did and stared back with indifference. No apology! Just an \u201copps\u201d. I mean\u2026REALLY people?!?! On to the room\u2026After figuring out the elevator keys with no help from the staff we arrived at our room only to find the maid still in there rushing around like a crazy person. I actually felt sorry her she looked so stressed. I told her to take her time, we\u2019ll just sit and wait for the roses, our luggage, etc. The maid was gone within a few mins, but it took the luggage almost a half hour, and the roses ANOTHER 20mins to get to the room after several inquiries down to the desk. The freezer (a sub zero appliance) did not work, so there was no ice which sucks when its 110 outside. The furnishings are like IKEA rejects\u2026very modern\u2026which in reality translates to cheap. It all looks cool, especially in the photos. But in person the quality is obviously lacking. There is dust behind almost everything. But I suppose this is the desert\u2026The air bubble spa never worked and went off with an ear-piercing \u201cswoosh\u201d in the middle of the night. It was shocking and did not shut off until a maintenance guy got up to the room 20mins after I called down to the desk, and this was after 3am. But the room does have some redeeming qualities. The wrap around balcony is awesome! The higher up floors do have a really great view. The bed was nice, TVs great, and the fire place is a nice touch. The Drift Spa is pathetic. They had no bottled or filtered water to offer any guests. \u201cThey were out\u201d. In California that is a violation of Spa establishment laws. Imagine not having any water after getting out of a steam room or sauna. The \u201cTurkish Hamman\u201d is not a true Hamman, for you world travelers out there who know better. And the staff would not stop attempting to up-sale me, even when I asked her to stop. It was very obnoxious. There are much better spas in Vegas! The Simon Restaurant is on par with any Wolfgang Puck joint. Nice d\u00e9cor, nice view of the pool. Overpriced, but delicious food and drink. Service was prompt and the hostess was practically topless\u2026 several nipple slips in a matter of seconds\u2026so no need to visit any strip-clubs. I wanted to complain to the management, but time is money and I decided to let it go. Life is too short to be pissed off. That\u2019s what TripAdvisor is for right? This is not a 4 or 5 star property. There are clearly serious problems with the management and the staffing. It\u2019s all very plastic and inauthentic.

I decided it was time to come \"home\" and visit with my friends. My travel dates were from March 5th - 12th. I have always been a fan of Sunday Margarita Brunch at Gardunos and decided I would book the 5th at The Palms, and then move to Trump International for the rest of my stay. Thanks to trip advisor, I knew to book in the Fantasy Tower. I am 30 years old and still like to go out, but I admit that I wasn't sure about staying here right before MTV was due to kick off spring break. Check in was very easy, no lines, and when I confirmed with the front desk agent that I was in the fantasy tower, I was told that the fantasy tower was sold out and I had been upgraded to Palms Place! This was fabulous news as I had actually considered Palms Place when booking my vacations. I wanted something that was a mixed use development (condo-tel), and narrowed down my choices to Vdara, Signature, Trump International, and Palms Place. In the end, Trump won and it was fabulous, but for the mean time, I was excited to see the competition. The trek to Palms Place was interesting. We had to use the \"sky tube\" and the elevator to the second floor wasn't working. Luckily I had a friend to help me lug one of my two 45 pound suitcases up to the second floor. Casinos have gotten better in their designs of getting guests from check in to their rooms. Mirage, Caesars, Treasure Island...I hate walking through a casino FOREVER with my luggage. That was kind of the situation here, but in all fairness, it was only because it was basically a relocation. My room was a studio on the 39th floor, overlooking the mountains to the west. I had a balcony that did not open. The sink at the bar did not work either. There was certainly nothing that was a \"deal breaker\" and I was just excited that I had been given an upgrade. The room was very nice, I loved the hardwood floors and carpeted seating area. Great use of space for sure. My friend and I discovered the dishwasher hidden under the desk/breakfast nook, and that was funny. The bathroom was... interesting. The tub is behind the shower, but I like the frosted glass wall against the tub that went into the bedroom. It reminded me of Shadow Bar at Caesars. The TV in the bathroom was nice, and had a DVD player in it. The sink in the bathroom has a design flaw. If you turn the water on too high, you are likely to splash everywhere. Every encounter I had with staff was great, ESPECIALLY at Gardunos. I made a reservation for brunch for 6 at 1030am on Sunday. Come Sunday morning, a friend of mine called and said they had to add 3 more!! I have seen people line up for this brunch, and was hoping there wouldn't be an issue. I called the operator and was told that reservations for the restaurant would not be open until they opened at 1030am. She said, \"let me see what I can do\" and put me on hold for a few minutes. When she came back on the line she said she had gotten a hold of the chef and he said it wouldn't be a problem, and to just say he said so! I was very impressed. I wish the balcony had opened, it was kind of disappointing that it was kept locked. Overall, it was a great stay for one night, and I would come back again IF Trump was sold out.

The staff was great, the ladies and gentleman who check you in are very knowledgeable, and can answer your questions, not just the question but try to get where you are going with what you are asking. I found out that instead of going to the spa each morning to work out, if I went down stairs to the front desk each morning I got a complimentary pass - not free but it was 9.99 plus tax to workout and sue the spa facilities. They have excellent workout facilities, even the pilates machines and classes. One of the guests had a personal trainer there, who came over to make sure I used the machines right. I had a great workout and at 7:30 in the morning, the whirlpool all to myself. The spa staff were great very friendly and helpful each day. The room we stayed in was a one bedroom suite, a lot like a W. We were short a few items, but each time we called room service, our staffer was there with what we needed rather quickly.

You should be aware that the Strip is a $10-12 cab ride away, which was perfect for us, but might come as a surprise to some. Also, the wireless fees are unnecessarily high, although we softened the blow by taking the 5 day access for $50, instead of the normal daily rate of $15. The standard of cleanliness of the suite was only average - when we checked in there was graffiti on one of the windows from a previous guest that hadn't been seen or cleaned. Not great.

We were offered a free cabana with the room and were were bascially kick out of the cabana because we \"didn't have a reservation\" even after we explained that we did.

You can see it under his shirt!\" So of course not one single person helped me. I figured the Palms must have tons of under-cover security around. Where were they? So I grabbed the man and grabbed my purse and then I tried hold on to him (I am such a goober.) I was screaming the whole time \"Help me! Help me!\" To make a long story short, he kept pushing me off him and we make it out side where finally a security guy side heard me screaming and he came to help.

I yelled at the security guard. \"No, he is just being a thief.

He said security is not for our personal safety! It is for the house not getting ripped off! Can you believe that crap? I went to the Orleans and asked the security there is that how this security thing works and their mouths dropped to the floor. They said they could not believe he said that to me. They said at the Orleans they most likely would have paid for my stay or upgraded my room. He just could NOT BELIEVE the manager said security was NOT THERE for our safety. That is what the man said.

Hotel is off the strip, but very accessible and not hard to find. Our check in went smoothly and we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room and the great views of the strip. The following, however, made our stay at Palms Place one that I would not want to repeat again and would not recommend it to any of my friends: - The lights in the main hallway right by the room entrance were not working, which made it hard to open the door and even harder to find a light switch inside the room. It would have been pretty spooky if I was by myself, but I wasn't scared with my husband by my side. Oh well, I thought I will just call the front desk and have them fix it. Called three times during our stay, but nobody came up to check it out and the light bulbs were not changed. - After walking in the room, we noticed the strange smell. I decided that it is from the cleaners they use and did not pay much attention. However, we noticed later that the cabinets and the kitchen counters were covered in dust! - The mini bar was locked the entire stay. Called the front desk, but my request was completely ignored again. - The next morning I decided to take a bath. Looking for a plug which was nowhere to be found I noticed several pieces of hair on the bottom of the tub. Being the optimist that I am, got some Kleenex and swiped it off. But when the water started to pour, there was more and more hair collecting on top!!!. In shock I called the front desk again and although my complaint was met with apologies from the front desk person, the housekeeper was only send up after I spoke to the manager! And that's all he could offer, a fast housekeeping service, which took about 15 minutes to show up. After the bathroom was cleaned the strange smell I mentioned before has disappeared. - Wrongful charges, mismanaged accounting and rude staff. At the time you reserve a room at Palms Place you credit card is charged for one night of you stay as a deposit for your reservation. It is noted on your reservation that the hotel will hold extra $150.00 on your credit card to cover the incidental charges. What they don't tell you is that it is not a hold, but an actual charge which is later supposed to be returned! The additional charge on my credit card was not $150, but $198, for a reason that the staff could not explain. And my credit card was charged three times more than the balance due on the reservation statement. After calling the accounting department, I was informed that the computer systems were down all this week and that they will not be able to return the wrongful charges for another week. In addition, my call was met with cold and arrogant attitude which I noticed from most of the staff member while staying there. The manager at the accounting department yelled at me for asking too many questions and not listening to her, when I was trying to figure out when and why the money was taken and how it will be refunded.

The Palms Casino is right next door, which you can use the tube to get back and forth if you really have to fulfill your gambling fix. I booked a Studio, but asked for a complimentary upgrade as I was renewing my wedding vows. They obliged. A bottle of champagne and cherries were also sent up to my room, which was a nice surprise. The room was much better than expected. Quite spacious, whirpool bath, beautifully built bathroom with shower, of course, guest bathroom, washer and dryer, which I utlized to the fullest, full kitchen, huge patio on the 51st floor with a great view of the strip. Did I mention the Whirlpool Bath? However, with the good there is usually a little bad. For whatever reason, Palms Place feels that they need to charge you $100 a day for incidentals. $100 a day???? This we were not informed of until we checked in so I had to fork over a $500 hold which could have put a serious damper on your vacation spending if you didn't have it. Wireless Internet is not free. $14.99 a day for the connection, when I balked on that, I was then told of signing up with BOINGO for my stay which was $21.99 for a month and there would be access with it at the Hotel, but if you check BOINGO out you would see that it is a ripoff as well. I passed on both. Used my Blackberry for Internet access and was just fine. The staff was nice and the valet's knew you by name, when you parked there, but if you didn't and utilized the free parking, which I didn't do much since I rented a Benz, they kind of forgot your name. The Cable channels were extremely limted for some reason, and to make matters worse, the first two nights I was there it wasn't functioning properly because of COX cable...so I was told. since I didn't come to Vegas to watch TV, I can give them a pass I guess. There is an automatic $1 a day phone charge, whether you use the phone or not. Talk about nickel and diming you.

Having visited Vegas several times before, my husband and I weren't worried about being slightly off strip - though the cab bills did add up over the course of the long weekend - so just something to factor into overall budget versus being more centrally located. A couple things that make me reluctant to stay here again: first would be the very young crowd - my husband and I are in our late twenties so are by no means old, but found ourselves overrun by 21-year old groups of guys and girls on the prowl..I was expecting a young, hip crowd, but this was almost too much at times. (This could have been more of an issue versus other times of year, as it was Labour Day weekend..) Second thing that would deter us from staying here again: staff. We had some great experiences with the bell boys, but also some pretty snotty experiences by staff at Simon restaurant and room service (sidenote: our room service table stayed outside our room door for a day and half after we ordered a meal - even with calling down..). All in all, this hotel delivers the trendy boutique hotel vibe in spades, the rooms themselves are amazing, and staff are somewhat hot/cold - but we aren't the type of people to let that affect our stay, so overall we really enjoyed ourselves at Palms Place.

For one the view cannot be beat. We had a corner, strip-view, one-bedroom suite and it was amazing- just like the picture on their website, maybe even better. Also, to be quite honest it was nice to be in such a hip and mellow atmosphere all while being close but not right in the middle of all the chaos of the strip. Just be prepared to get cabs when you do want to go to the strip, but in the August heat you most likely need cabs to get from point-to-point on the strip regardless. My favorite aspects of this property are the pool, Simon Restaurant, and of course the rooms. The pool is great and I am not really a pool person. It is very laid back with a great staff. Simon is just a great restaurant with a perfect atmosphere. The rooms are everything you could ask for including a balcony and jetted tub. It is also nice to be close to the Palms via an air conditioned walkway. Palms has some very good restaurants such as N9ne, which we enjoyed very much. I would have liked to also have tried Little Buddha but did not have time. The clubs in the Palms are also a great attraction. Playboy Club has an awesome view and Moon is an experience in itself.

Despite being a large Vegas hotel it still somehow managed to retain a boutqiue hotel vibe. It's probably both of these things that continue to attract the celebs. We stayed in a Studio Suite on the 38th floor. We had an amazing strip view looking back over the main Palms Hotel and Casino. The room was everything we needed. We were initially going to upgrade to a one bed suite but they didn't have one with a strip view. The Stuido Suite was plenty big enough and the large wet room with multiple showers and jakuzzi bath really hit the spot. Service was mostly excellent. Even when they screwed up by waking us up at 4am with someone elses room service order, they made up for it the following day by sending a big basket up. The pool area (on the 6th floor) at the Palms Place retained the boutique vibe being relatively small but not too overcrowded. The spa was also great. The Palms Place is ajoined to the main casino by a moving walkway but it only takes a few minutes to travel between the two. The only other place I've stayed at in Vegas is the MGM, which I really likes. Other places I'd imagine likeing would be the Bellagio, the Encore (Wynn) and the Palazzo (Venitian), but I'm not sure if their luxury could make up for how much I enjoyed being slightly away from the strip.

We had a small full kitchen with a 30 second heat up stove top, fully stocked minifridge and another minifridge with an ice maker. There was a dishwasher, full sink with a modern fixture and spout head. Plates, cups and bowls included. Big microwave but no oven. All in stainless steel. We had a HUGE bathroom. There was a small television so you could watch television while soaking in the deep tub. The shower had two heads: one above from the 10 foot high ceiling like a rainfall and one handheld one you could also use. This is great for anyone whose taller than 5'8\" (5'8\" is the standard Vegas shower height). The sink was one of the bowl basins. The BEST part about the bathroom and kitchen is that the hot water turns on immediately at warm/hot. The floors were marble in the kitchen and bath and hardwood in the living/sleeping area. The ceilings were at least 10 feet high making the room seem even larger. The pool was closed due to \"inclement weather.\" I learned this happens every day around 2:30pm b/c the building and pool location was not well designed so that you would have any sunlight after 2:30pm in the pool area (instead the pool hides in the shadow of the building itself). HOWEVER... The pool at Palms Casino is available and the best in Vegas hands down. It's got a good mix of people. This means you will of course see the Los Angeles bimbos with fake books busting out of their dental floss outfits and hooker heels, and who are stupid enough to think any man would bring that sort of stripper look home to their mother. There are the muscle testosterone MMA fighter looking men with tatoos. But the crowd is mainly made-up of people in their late 20s to late 30s, who are mellow and just looking to get a tan and get drunk while doing it. The cocktail waitstaff girls are hit or miss. You'll either get someone sweet, wonder, fast, attentive to both men and women (Sam was our favorite), or the occasional hard edged [ --XXXXX-- ]that only serve men who will appreciate their fake boobs. The casino is pretty good. It's one of the few with $5 tables for the novice, which I love. I won $300 at a $5 crap table on one roller. My husband won $90 at a $0.25 slot machine. Enough said. There's a Sonic across the street for an awesome slushie during the 100+ degree weather. There's a shopping plaza across the street that has a 24 hour deli as well as a head shop/smoke shop if you smoke. The people who work at The Palms Place (not the Palms) are VERY gracious. You give them 25 cents as a tip and they thank you profusely. Very humble, good honest people. I liked returning to The Palms Place, away from all the nightclub junkies & Eurotrash and all their flamable clothing, hair and two pounds of make-up. Check-in was super easy.

The quick dial keys to get messages, or call any of the departments (like housekeeping, room service, etc..) were broken. The internet connection program is broken ( you have to log in a couple times before it works and then again if you get back on your machine; this results in several charges that need to be removed before you check-out).

However on arrival, was told they were fully booked for the weekend and they would \"upgrade\" me to a suite at Palms Place, part of the same complex but ten minutes (15 minutes after a beer or two!) across the walkway to the main hotel. I complained a bit (fool that I am) but was promised I wouldn't be disappointed. You can then imagine my surprise when I found my room on the 18th Floor of Palms Place to be a corner suite that usually retails at $2,900 a night, with massive flat screen tv's everywhere, massive lounge, kitchen, spa tub, and two balconies! Boy, did I boast to \"the lads\" that night, but then had to fight them all off from raiding the room for the rest of the stay (only joking!). Very comfortable indeed, needless to say there were parts of that suite I am sure I didn't quite get to visit during my busy stay there, it was so huge! The Palms was a great place all round, and our party hardly went to any other Las Vegas venues as the ample choice of bars, restaurants, night clubs/disco's were so great. The table staff are very friendly and competent, and we had a superb time with a couple of croupiers on blackjack, educating them on Brucie Forsyth's \"everyone's a winner\" line, that surprisingly they couldn't quite get (being non-Brits)! The Mint bar is a great place to chill after a night out, and Ghostbar too at the very top of the hotel (55th floor me thinks). We did try the Playboy Club - had to be done - but one does get absolutely ripped off on the drinks there. The Rain disco was \"okay\". A few of us enjoyed a superb meal at N9NE steakhouse which was outstanding, otherwise being on a stag do most of my daily sustenance was catered by superb fry ups at the 24/7 Cafe which were great and of good value. The pool, both at Palms, and Palms Place (where it was quiter and more chilled out) were great.

After a week traveling the Southwest we finished our stay here the evening before our flight left. The hotel is set apart from the Casino complex (though connected by a moving walkway), and immediately upon entering we fell into an oasis of calm. We were quickly checked into a 1 bedroom suite on the 11th floor. Pictures are posted from other reviewers, but it really doesn't do the room justice. I love the prior comment about it being a \"Lad's Pad\", which is maybe why I loved it so much! We're talking a super comfy king bed, two huge flat screens (one with a DVD player), One and a half bathrooms, one decked out in white marble with a huge shower with rainwater and dual showerheads, a fireplace, a full kitchen, and an oversized spa tub set out right in the bedroom. And the VIEW- two balconies showcase the strip and the red rocks of Vegas. I We immediately began to chill in the room, then set out to use the spa, which was fairly basic with the exception of the Hamman (kind of like a steam room, but not as hot and with great smells). We had dinner at Nove Italiano at the Palms, where I had honestly the best steak in my life. The location is off strip, but for me this just adds to its appeal. If you want to visit the Vegas everyone else is at, just drive and park at Ceasars Palace or grab a cab; it's less than a mile away. To finish it all off, every employee we encountered was cheerful and friendly, and we did not at all feel out of place (we are about as far away from Hollywood A-list as you can get!).

We also noticed that lots of films had premiered there and there was shots of Brad Pitt and George Clooney on the screens entering the cinema.

The suite had 1.5 bathrooms and a separate jetted tub located in between the living room and bedroom. The master bathroom had a huge walk in shower with 1 rain head and 2 individual shower heads. The lcd tv in the bathroom was a nice touch. Two other 42' flat screens are available in the suite as well. This suite could easily accommodate 4 people to sleep comfortably and probably 15-20 people if you wanted to have them over for drinks. Ordered room service for breakfast one morning. Arrived exactly on time as promised. Had a bagel, oatmeal, and pot of coffee. Both Valet and Self parking are complimentary at this condo hotel but wireless internet is $13.99 per 24hrs. They do have an onsite spa which costs $30 a day to use their facilities (including the fitness center). I asked the front desk for a comp pass to try it out and they had no problem giving one to me. The fitness center is great; all cardio machines have individual tvs, bottled water, and towels waiting for you. The men's lockerrooms were great; they had a sauna, steam room, cold plunge pool, and hot whirlpool. They also had the co-ed \"Hammam\" which is similar to a Turkish bath. Both men and women can use it (you must wear a towel/bathing suit) and it's very similar to a steam room. Unfortunately, it wasn't that hot the entire week I was there. Lastly, there is a small lounge room to relax and watch tv in. Complimentary juices and bottled water are available. I tried the 50 min Drift Massage and was happy with it. Very professional staff and great experience overall. They automatically add 20% gratuity to each service so you don't have to worry about tipping. After using a 25% off coupon I got when I checked in, I paid $123 including tip and taxes. The hotel's pool is open from 9am-6pm each day. The pool is very modern, trendy and is overlooked by the Simon restaurant. There are cabanas to rent, however, they are small and are fairly dark when you are inside them. I actually enjoy the sun when I'm by the pool so I'm not a fan of cabanas. The bar by the pool is convenient; expect mixed drink prices to be $7-10 ea. Although this condotel has no casino it is connected to the Palms via sky tube. This is easily a 5 min journey from lobby to lobby. There are even moving sidewalks for you to relax on should you be so lazy. Each employee of this hotel went above the level of customer service typically found in Vegas. The nice thing about this hotel is that I wasn't constantly dodging people left and right when walking around (like you do in the MIrage or other larger properties).

I was able to book this place for only $99 a day (we only stayed here for a night) and it was well worth the price. The room was really technologically advanced and beautiful. There were 3 TVs: 1 in the bathroom and 2 in the bedroom. I thought it was over the top to have so many TVs, but I found myself watching tv on 1 screen and my boyfriend watched ESPN on the other screen. The kitchen was really nice even though I didn't get to use it, and it had a fully stocked bar (it's electronically censored so if you remove an item, the purchase goes on your card) The bed was so comfortable and came with A LOT of pillows. The bathroom didn't have a screen for the shower and it got kind of messy, but overall it was a great experience. This place is totally trendy and new.

Starting with the Mirage, the Aladdin, the Venetian, Mandalay bay and now the palms. I was out for the superbowl with my friends for a guys weekend and we were comp'd a regular room at the Palms, worst room Ive stayed in in Vegas. No different than quality inn. So first off I would never recommend that tower, although my friend did say the \"fantasy tower\" was much nicer. We planned another trip with our girlfriends for this labor day, and this time stayed at Palms Place. Let me preface this by saying my friends room was fine and he had no problems. That being said, mine was awful. The dirtiest room Ive ever been in and also let me say, ive stayed in some shady places. I actually had to call down and get someone to come up and look at the room. The room was covered in dust and the carpet had gum pressed into it, the couches were stained, the furniture was banged up there were stains on the pillows. It was nasty, they felt awful about it and quickly sent another cleaning women in. My problem isnt with the service, its that if your paying $330 a night, midweek, for a room in vegas (it was a 1 bedroom suite) it should be flawless. And sadly it wasnt. As I said they were more than accomodating when it was brought to their attention but it was gross. As for the rest of the stay, the pool is WAY to small and not nearly enough chairs there, and one side of the pool gets blacked out from the sun mid afternoon. Poorly designed. So go over to the main pool at the palms, much much better. Another problem is the casino is a long way away from the palms place tower, which if your a gambler stinks! You have to go down 2 different elevators across 2 moving sidewalks and down a hallway to get to the farthest point of the casino! It really was a pain, and to be honest another disappointment at Plams place. Also if you come home late and want to eat you have to make that journey to the 24hr cafe, or order room service. Also if you do decide to stay here, take notice of the materials in the rooms, they were cheap, except for the appliances, it's vinyl paneling and particle board. To me it seems as though they tried to make something that looks nice but made it out of crap. It was weird, its a room thats set up for the night though, it looks cool with the intresting lights they have at night. Open the drapes in the day and its not so sexy, kinda like a nightclub. Lastly I found out after I was there that each one of these units are owned by private owners and leased back to the palms. So the condition of each room is different. So to finish, this place is good for 20somethings who want to party, i would not have been nearly as dissapointed if I was on another guys weekend, but being there with my girlfriend it was a dissapointment. The palm s as a whole is set up for the hip and trendy crowd, awesome nightclubs, celebrities on the weekends, and some fantastic restaurants. But is not for someone looking for a low key pampered vacation. Also the palms casino is dead during the week. I felt like I was on a bus trip in Atlantic city! One more drawback is the actual location of the Palms off the strip...I didnt have a strip view room so I was looking at the mountains and you never really get that Vegas vibe when you cant walk out onto the strip. Next stop the Wynn or Palazoo, they look fabulous. Guys weekend...stay at MGM lots more action, take a cab to the Palms.", "Date": "September 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cLOVED THE PALMS PLACE!!\u201d", "Author": "MelOntario", "ReviewID": "UR20121235", "Content": "We stayed at the Palms Place August 25-28, 2008. By far this has to be one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in! CHECK IN - My cousin had called the day before to see if we can get our room ealy seeing that our plane landed in the morning and they said \"no problem\", however when we arrived at noon our room wasn't ready till after 3pm, my cousin didn't get hers till 4pm, she did complain to the manager and they upgraded her to a one bedroom suite. Check in was fast after that. We got passes for the clubs and they put our names on the list. ROOM: We booked the Studio Suite which is pretty big for two people. Comfortable king size bed, sitting area, two 42 inch screen tv's side by side ( and yes at one point my husband and I had the tv's on different channels ;) , fully equiped kitchen, a balcony with a view of the strip, and a huge shower & tub in the bathroom. It was VERY clean everyday. The one day the housekeeping didn't show up till 4pm which was a little annoying but overall good service. Tons of clean towels everyday, and the towels are HUGE! FOOD: I didn't try room service however I did eat at the Mexican restaurant at the Palms Hotel which was very good and we at at Simon's Lounge out by the pool one day which was also very good. POOL: Very small and quiet but it was great! We got a free cabana rental with the hotel promotion when we booked. It helped alot because the sun in August is way too hot! Great service at the pool. The pool at the Palms looked like the \"party pool\" to go to, however I never made it to that pool. SPA: Spent 2 hours in the spa at the palms place. Best 2 hours I ever spent!!! I really recommend trying one of the services in the spa. TO GO ON THE STRIP: Their is a free shuttle that leaves at the Palms hotel I think at 11am, 2pm, & 5pm that goes to the Forum Shops and Fashion Show Mall. Ask for a schedule when you check in. We also cabbed it there a couple of times and it usually cost around $9 PLAYBOY CLUB/MOON: We were on the list to get in but the \"boys\" still had to pay a $20 cover charge. This was on a Tuesday night. We went to Moon first which was very \"stuffy\" for us and they played alot of \"Trance/Rave music\" so we went to the Playboy Club. More relaxing atmosphere, not stuffy, and we were actually allowed to sit on one of the couches which is also great especially if your stuck wearing heel's! Just ask the bouncer if you are allowed to sit there instead of paying $450 for bottle service. As long as no one had reserved it your good to sit! All in all the Palms Place is absolutley beautiful! Great service, and only a 5 min walk to the Palms Hotel.

Room service was extremely accommodating, and we ended up staying in the Palms complex for most of the night. Had dinner at N9NE, a very good steak house and one of the Palms restaurants, and found the Ghostbar and the Club Moon to be the best places to party (we also tried Tao at the Venetian, but found it overrated), and loved the pool party they threw for guests. Be sure to ask to be comped in to bar and club if you have already spent hundreds of dollars eating there; we found all the general managers there to be extremely customer-friendly and highly competent, and met some of the greatest bartenders ever. Getting a spray-on tan at Sunset Tan was a fun experience as well. Very few downsides: Reception staff was just a bit arrogant, gym was too expensive (should be included imo), and the free shuttle to the strip turned out to be a bus that went twice daily only, so had the little added expense of a cab each way.

I went for 2 nights with my boyfriend to celebrate my 26th birthday. We stayed on the strip for 3 nights afterwards but wished that we could have stayed at the Palms Place the entire time. Would have if I hadn't prepaid for the other hotel. Our flight was 2 hours late because of a storm and strong winds by the airport. Circled around the dessert for a while and couldn't wait to land. Went to the hotel at 4:50 pm. Had to wait 10 minutes before someone helped us. Once helped, the room wasn't ready, not a good start. Went to the Rio buffet, yum. So good! Received a call 20 minutes after we had tried to check in, the room was ready and on the 8th floor. I was a bit irritated on our way back to the hotel since I had called a few days earlier to request a high room. I asked the second person to check us in if there was a note about a high room, and she said no. I told her I had requested it since it was my birthday and wanted a nice view. She quickly upgraded us to a 1 bedroom for my birthday and apologized. Score! The room was incredible. My boyfriend and I could not believe how beautiful it was. We had a strip view on the 26th floor with a wrap around balcony. The bathrooms, 1 full and 1 half, were all marble. The shower had 3 showerheads. It was great for my boyfriend who is 6' 5\". The kitchen had a subzero fridge, stainless steel tops, etc. Plenty of room to store water, food and cocktails. The living room had a fireplace, plasma tv, pull out couch, a couple chairs and a desk. My favor part was the soaking tub in the bedroom. Loved it! We didn't have time to go to the pool, restaurant or spa. We walked through them though. Very nice. Maybe next time. We spent a lot of time at the Palms, which is adjoined by a moving walkway. Ate at the buffet, which is so affordable and tasty. Good variety and not as expensive as the other ones. The tables have low minimum bets, which is a huge plus. Had 2 shots and 2 cocktails at the bar, $26. Not bad. I paid $28 for 2 cocktails at most other casinos. The concierge put us on the list for Moon. Went early and was let right in. No cover, which we liked. Hung out in the Playboy Club for about 20 minutes until Moon opened. Views were great in both places. Drink prices were average for a club, but were made well. Not too strong or weak. It was not overly packed inside, just the right amount of people. Soulja Boy performed too, which was a riot. We were very sad to leave, especially with the horrible experience we had at the second hotel.
