The apartment had a lot of doors, and they were quite heavy. They were probably fire doors, but nevertheless there were many doors in this little apartment! Before we went I read that you could hear traffic noice in the bedrooms. But this is London! What can you expect?!

The rooms were cleaned every day with clean towels daily. I loved the fact that we had a choice of eating out or eating in with the fully equiped kitchen (however it would have been nice to have had some washing-up liquid). The hotel was very handy for public transport and the Heathrow Express. The only comment I would make is the standard of the breakfast. You'd think they could have varied the selection - not everyone wants corn flakes and sausages every day. The only bad point were the door closers on every door within the suite. They made the doors close too quickly and we hurt ourselves on them when we didn't get out the road quickly enough. We ended up having to wedge open the lounge and bedroom doors! On the whole, a very nice place to stay.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bordeaux, France", "Title": "\u201cDecent value in London\u201d", "Author": "Flomij", "ReviewID": "UR113427933", "Content": "The hotel is located close to Paddington station, so it's easy to take a bus or the underground to any place in London, but I would have prefered to be more central (Piccadily). The street is nice. Lot's of hotels on it. This hotel (Aspen Apartments) has a nice lobby, but the rooms are quite modest, but very clean. We had a 2 bedroom apartment. The rooms are very small and there is only one bathroom and no separate toilet, which is a pain if you are 4 people. The windows let quite a bit of noise in, to the point where you think the window is not well closed. The curtains are letting light in, so if you like a dark room to sleep, this is not the place for you. As for the breakfast, you have to wait in line and it seems the tables are not cleaned up fast enough, but it's probably due to a short number of people working there at the time. Breakfast is adequate, but really bare minimum. If you like toast, butter and jam, you are ok. The hot chocolate is incredibly sugary. Stay away from it. Staff is friendly. Rooms are very clean. An ok hotel, but I will try something else next time.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cClean and well-located apartments in Paddington\u201d", "Author": "kraml", "ReviewID": "UR31183643", "Content": "The Aspen Suites provide me with a lot of what I need on a business trip: a great location for public transport within London or trains to other cities, an apartment with cooking facilities and a washer/dryer, a free internet connection (though remember to bring a connector cable from your laptop to the wall socket), and a very high standard of cleanliness. Granted, some of the furniture is getting a bit tired, and the breakfast is monotonous (though plentiful), but this is Central London and you can do a lot, lot worse.

We had a two bedroom apartment. It was very clean, small /tidy, but sufficient sized bedrooms, and a good sized sofa bed in addition . The living room was nice. The home from home convenience provided by apartment as opposed to hotel room living, was great. The TV -DVD was handy to have especially when you have young kids, reception has a list of DVD's you can rent for free, and overall the apartment was great, and in comparison to trying to get a family room or two rooms in a hotel it was much better and good value. too The breakfast was fine., your get basically orange juice, cornflakes, ham & cheese toast and tea, what more than you can expect at these prices, and it does fill you up for the day ahead. The reception staff I found friendly and nice. Of course with all the places in Sussex Gardens you are getting first and foremost a handy location in terms of closeness to the city tourist sites. The noise from the traffic was constant and little shielded by the single glazed windows, but not too loud and certainly not enough to stop 5 very tired tourists sleeping soundly through it every night. I would really recommend this place to any one with young kids in the 5 to 13 age bracket. One small gripe the internal doors in the apartment were very heavy, and needed a good push to open, and swung shut automatically so would not recommend to younger kids as they literally would struggle to be able to open the doors and would definitely get the fingers stuck at some point ! We never really used the clean kitchen apart from light snacks as you are surrounded by restaurants nearby. The place was cleaned every day and was spotless overall. We would definitely recommend and would come back. With a place like this you have an idea what you are booking in the first place ( not the Savoy or the Ritz), and those expectations were well surpassed , we had a great time.", "Date": "May 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Teesside", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, very clean.\u201d", "Author": "Eastieboy", "ReviewID": "UR10467916", "Content": "Stayed at the Aspen as a family of five in a two bedroomed apartment. Yes I agree it was small, but if you want 5 star rooms, pay for them! Shower was powerful, bathroom was rather small but adequate.

Vey basic breakfast - but it is free! Less than 5 minutes walk to Paddington Underground, some nice Restaurants, Chinese, Indian, Italian plus the usual Steak Houses, all within 10 minutes walk around Paddington. One problem, it is very noisy, the traffic outside is constant & the windows not all double glazed, if you are a light sleeper it will be a problem. We found reception more than helpful & very nice with the children. Yes it is \u00c2\u00a310 for the remote, but you do get it back! Black Cabs run constantly along the road outside the Aspen, very easy & quick to flag one down. The Aspen can be difficult to locate - the Hotel is actually listed as Abbeywood so it would be best to let your cab driver know that - we found it very easily.

Very small rooms but very clean and great location and its good having the extra living space if one wants to go to bed earlier than the other. We didn't find it too noisy. Breakfast was very basic but you could get a full English breakfast for an extra cost. My husband was a bit surprised about the charge for the remote but no problems getting it back. My only complaint came on our last day. We had said to the trainee receptionist the day before that we would need a taxi to Kings Cross station and should we order ahead of time or flag one down in the street. She quoted us 10.00 to 15.00 if she ordered one for us so we decided to do so. The car was the hotel's own as the driver was in the hotels uniform and I had seen him around there.

Heating was not working. I queried this with three different staff and got three different responses - \"It doesn't come on till later\"/\"It's in a short (2 hour) shut down phase\"/\"We'll send up maintenace but that won't be till tomorrow\". Eventually, at gone 8pm, a free standing heater was obtained & brought to the room. There were no curtains at the windows, just a VERY flimsy slatted blind that blocked out almost no light (in the bedroom only). I have been unwell recently and often need a day time snooze - I'd have liked to have done so in the dark! The shower IS pathetic and fixed head only. (When will hotels learn these make it almost impossible for us ladies to keep our hair dry!) TV reception was bad and the channels very limited. No radio either. There's even a \u00c2\u00a310 deposit for the remote - the only other place I've ever been asked for this was in a budget (32 quid a night) Etap hotel. The kitchen is basic but workable, however it lacks those extra welcoming touches. No cleaning stuff, non existent instructions for washer and cooker and most importantly - NO TEAPOT. When I requested one, I was told no one had access to the kitchen until the following morning at 7.15am. Not surprised those who sampled the breakfast were disappointed.....since they start serving at 7.30am they can hardly put much care into its preparation! The website doesn't inform you & nor do the staff that it's 10.30am check out (threats of an additional whole days charge should this be contravened). This info is only on the room card and on a notice in the room; along with a list of other \"dos & don'ts\" - very boarding house! Comments about the staff were pretty accurate - a couple of requests were either ignored/forgotten, or done too late. By the time my extra loo roll arrived, I'd gone out & bought some myself.... The above are perhaps 'minor' quibbles, but taken as a whole it means I certainly won't be staying here ever again", "Date": "September 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cModern, small, cheap and noisy!\u201d", "Author": "thatgirl101", "ReviewID": "UR7260555", "Content": "I'm currently staying at the Hyde Park Suites in Bayswater, London, W2. I booked a room on their website after lots of email communication with some of their staff regarding the suitability of the room for my purposes (business). After being reassured that the room would be big enough for two business people to work in, I booked a triple suite. Unfortunately I was informed that this was no longer available, but they provided me with a two person flat at a discount, which I was happy with. When I arrived at the main reception desk, I was informed that I had to give them a copy of my passport (why?!) and had to pay \u00c2\u00a310 upfront for a key deposit. I was only given ONE key between myself and my partner, and when I asked if another was available, I was told that there wasn't. I also found out that the wireless internet was payable PER COMPUTER as they use a log-on system which is computer-specific. We were placed in a room down the road at their new accommodation on the fourth floor, with a broken lift, which wasn't great when we had two huge suitcases with us. The room itself was nicely decorated (Ikea), all clean, but very small (although I was expecting this). It had a small modern bathroom, a small kitchen/lounge and a bedroom. The bathroom was very clean and looked great, however the shower was rather puny - it was like standing under a tap! The room had cable TV and a flat-screen TV, but didn't actually have any English channels except BBC World. I rang up the desk and requested that we had some English ones, to which I was told that it would be sorted the next day, which it was. The kitchen was good, and there were enough utensils to cook decent food. I have stayed 5 nights and have had my towels changed, but nobody has been to change my bin (which I had to put outside the room in the hallway because it was smelling!) or clean the rooms. It's a good thing I bought some loo roll with me! Lol! Another irritation was that being on the fourth floor, and only having one key, it would have been useful to have had a buzzer system which worked! It obviously hasn't been wired in properly. These were all pretty minor concerns though. The one thing which did bother me though was the noise. Maybe because I am not used to staying in London it bothered me more than it might bother others, but when laying in bed, it sounded like the windows were wide open and there was a lot of street noise. The first night I didn't sleep until 3am! The people above me were also very noisy at night, and you can hear people moving around all the time. All in all, it is good value for money if you are happy to make a few minor concessions. The location is great and it is literally 5 minutes from the tube.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, England", "Title": "\u201cTerrible service!!\u201d", "Author": "pinkapricot", "ReviewID": "UR6812000", "Content": "The front desk at Aspen Suites have the worst possible attitudes that I have ever encountered. The male trainee that attended to me at check in was cold and rude. My room wasn't ready on arrival, though I was told to check in at 1pm. I had a one bedroom apartment which was pretty small but neat and clean. I was actually considering staying here again but such terrible service made me change my mind. The front desk's attitude makes it seem like they don't really care whether you stay with them or not. Parking at this hotel is not free. It's a ridiculous \u00c2\u00a310 a day even for hotel guests. And you have to leave your car keys with them. When my friend asked for his car keys the next day, the girl at the front desk was rude and asked him loads of questions before handing him his keys. No 'Hello' or 'Good Morning'. Just a sour face for you. After checking out, I realised that I'd left something in the room so we went back to get it. The same female trainee said that because we'd already checked out, we had to wait in the lobby while she called the housekeeper. After a 20 minute wait, there was still no news so I asked if we could go up and look for it ourselves. It took her 10mins to get back to us and another 5 mins for the housekeeper to take us to our room. We found what we were looking for immediately. What could have taken us less than 5 minutes, took more than half an hour and as a result, we were very late for an appointment we had that afternoon.

There is a dining room downstairs serving breakfast but we preferred to make use of our kitchen for light meals and snacking. Paddington Railway Station - with its Underground Station - is a mere 5 minute walk away. There is grocery store at the station as well which we found quite useful. A good range of restaurants, pubs and shops are all located nearby. A very safe neighbourhood -- we were out quite late many nights and never felt or encountered any threat to personal safety. The only real negative is that Sussex Gardens is a much busier and noisier thoroughfare than anticipated - traffic was pretty intense - even until quite late at night.
