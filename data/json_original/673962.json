Once I got to the hotel, the front desk clerk told me my room was ready, but there was no water, and he pointed to the kiosk and said there is bottled water in there. I thought that was nice, and helped myself to two bottles and went to my room. Within minutes the phone rang and it was the front desk asking me if I took two bottles of water, and I stated yes. I was taken aback when he then asked me why I didn't pay for them. I told him he told me to help myself, but he said that was not what he meant. Rather than argue with me further, he informed me he would go ahead and just put them on my room at $3.00 apiece. Not 15 minutes later, the phone rang again; this time the front desk informed me the voucher didn't include 10 of the 20% tax. He asked that I come down and settle up, so I grabbed my voucher and proceeded to the front desk again. Once I got there, I produced the voucher which clearly stated I had paid in full, including taxes. The same clerk argued with me that I was going to have to pay the extra 10%, or Discover would charge me later anyway. I showed him the fine print, and he then said he wanted to make a copy of the voucher. I informed him this error was between Discover Card and the hotel, and if they sold the room for a lower price that is wasn't my fault. Five minutes later he came back and told me they would look into it. He then pointed to my voucher which showed the cash back bonus I am to get for using the Discover Card Travel services. He tried to tell me this was the 10% I was going to be charged by Discover Card. He clearly did not understand the Discover Card Cash Back Bonus Program. At this point I almost lost it, and started to ask for a refund, telling him I could have stayed at a 100 other hotels and in the first 15 minutes, I had already had two problems with the hotel. He backed down and told me everything would be ok, that he would even give me free water. I hated to get rough with the guy but sternness seems to be the only approach to take to get things done in Dubai. Anyway, other than the shower being clogged all week, the room was ok as with the free breakfast. There were one, maybe two other restaurants within 2-3 blocks from the hotel and the Metro station was another 3-4 blocks from the restaurants. Though I am a frequent traveler to Dubai, I will make sure to stay clear of this hotel. The final question was, was I going to be billed for the water, or not? When I went to check out, a young lady was working and told me I still owed $6 for water. I asked for a receipt and she stated that I could not have one since my bill was settled by the voucher. I asked her what is going to keep another employee from charging me again, and she just shrugged her shoulders. So much for the free water after all!", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cAdequate for a quick overnight but wouldn't stay longer.\u201d", "Author": "LoyaltyLobby", "ReviewID": "UR122927179", "Content": "This hotel is located close to the Dubai Marina but there really isn\u2019t anything in the immediate area for touristic purposes. To be fair this hotel is not geared for tourists but for business travelers visiting the nearby companies/educational institutions. The really nice looking lobby and restaurant area gives a wrong impression.The rooms are looking dated and has probably the smallest TV set I have seen for some time. Hotel is fine for a quick overnight but wouldn\u2019t spend more time there. There are no bellboys working at this hotel, so I had the security guy helping me to load the bags that I had in to a cart, which I later took to the room by myself. There was no separate are for Priority Club Platinum members, or should I say that there was but it was not manned. Overall the check in was ok. I was promptly checked in to a room 112. Not sure if they have any better rooms than 112, but as Platinum member I wasn\u2019t overly satisfied. Not sure what I can say about it. It was rather basic as one can expect from a Holiday Inn Express hotel. But even then, if the hotel is located in the INTERNET CITY, they should probably have wireless internet access. The wired one worked, but the Ethernet cable was super short. I probably should start carrying a small wireless router with me. Fitness center was tot really adequate in today\u2019s world. It might have been acceptable ten years ago. Should be updated. Like everything else this hotel breakfast was so sol. Was not great but wasn\u2019t horrible either. Should I say adequate? Not sure what the unidentifiable eggs dish was, however. Everything fell apart at check out. This hotel participates to the Dynamic Currency Conversion. Basically their bank converts the local currency AED to the currency of your credit card and takes, on this case, 3.6% commission. The Visa/MasterCard/Amex all would do it automatically using market rates. Your bank or credit card issue may charge a free for foreign transaction but it is most certainly less than 3.6%. The key here is that they should OFFER it to you. They should NOT automatically do it. I insisted that they charge in local currency. This resulted the checking out taking forever. They charged incorrectly twice before manager got involved who knew how to do this correctly. There is absolutely NO ADVANTAGE for you when they do this DCC. It is just more money to the hotel, as the bank splits some of this \u201cfee\u201d with the hotel.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cGreat new years eve deal spent without music\u201d", "Author": "AviatorDubai", "ReviewID": "UR122896658", "Content": "We were 4 friends booked at the Vista restaurant for new years eve celebrations.

Things have not improved. Sad that they charge you for Internet connection, and it is not cheap. Room was looking pretty tired, kind of shabby and sort of run-down. Five of the ~ 20 TV channels were just dead air and several others had reception issues where there was no audio or marginal signal. The bathroom fittings were as worn as the room furniture -- shower door that didn't close all the way and several cracked tiles glued in a haphazard manner. I am not completely convinced they did not find a bunch of faux display beds (cardboard forms that you can drape sheets over to look like a bed) for the rooms. If you like sleeping on a concrete slab with either a ridiculously soft pillow or an incompressible pillow (\"your CHOICE of pillow\"), then the bed will be to your liking; if you want to get some rest in your bed you should look elsewhere. The \"complimentary buffet\" consisted of two different frozen, reconstituted juices (varied each day but all were equally horrid), 3 different types of cereals, fresh apples/bananas, sliced vegetables (cucumbers, olives, tomatoes), bowls of yogurt/hummus, two types of sliced cheeses, and several jams for small croissant rolls and slices of bread with a toaster. Not a very substantial breakfast but technically a buffet I suppose. Aside from being close enough to walk to Knowledge Village, there is not anything else to do. I am certain there are better choices for lodging and the people who rate this place 4 stars must not get out much. I can't say there have been any discernible improvements in the two years since last I stayed here, I may have even been in the same \"non-smoking\" room that was next to and across from smoking rooms...brilliant.

The rooms are a decent size, the beds are comfortable and the bathroom is generally ok, though it would have been nice if there was a bath also. The staff are friendly and polite. Housekeeping do tend to knock on your door early, often waking you so if you don't want to be disturbed then its best to stick the \"do not disturb\" sign on the front of the door before you go to sleep. The gym is situated on the 1st floor...its functional. Breakfast after 2 days got very repetitive...white or brown bread or mini croissants/pain au chocolats...3 varieties of yogurts, cereal, hot milk, cheese (not allowed to melt the cheese on toast through the toaster), grapefruit and a selection of juices/coffee/tea. Every morning its the same. However what the hotel does not tell you is that there is a supermarket open from either 9 or 10 am until 11pm called Aswaaq about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. There is also a pharmacy on the same side of the road as the supermarket and the most perfect nail salon. Honestly the best nail spa we have ever been to, the nails are done fabulously as are the other treatments including the full body massage - definately worth a try. There is a pharmacy about units down from the Nail Spa and about 3 units before Aswaaq supermarket. There is also a Subway around the corner, another eatery and a 24 hr ATM though the hotel has a 24 hour atm in the lobby. The food the hotel sells in the lobby is much more expensive than in the supermarkets so it is worth checking that out as soon as you get there - there is a small fridge in the room which comes in handy. The VISTA restaurant on the 5th floor in the building next to the hotel is absolutely beautiful. The food is 1st class though it can get slightly pricey if you have more than one course with drinks...for a party of two with a main course, two side and two drinks it came to 220 dhs though the hotel does offer you a 20% discount which comes in useful so for a party of more than two it will be expensive however the food is worth it and the views across Dubai are beautiful. In addition there are two TV's situated by the bar. The hotel itself is situated in the middle of nowhere it seems. Apart from the free shuttle to the Mall of the Emirates - recommended and a free shuttle to the Dubai Outlet Mall - don't even waste your time, taxi's are needed to get everywhere. Check and double check the pick up times from the hotel to the Mall and the Mall to the hotel because you may well find the sheet of times you are given by the hotel do not correlate with the times given in the Mall. We found that the Dubai Taxi, the cream ones with Taxi written on top were generally cheaper than the ones the hotel called for you to use each day so if possible stick to them. Jumeriah Beach is 10-15 mins max away and shouldnt cost more than 25 dhs each way. The \"open beach\" is free and the \"closed beach\" is approx 5 dhs but the open beach is all you need. The Gold Souk is approx half an hour away and costs between 50-60 dhs each way but it is one of the most worthwhile trips to do. To make getting around more cost effective, particualarly to get to more of the Malls such as the new Dubai Mall it is worth while nothing that you can get a cab to hotels local to HIExpress including the Westin Hotel and Raddison Blu and pick up the free shuttles to the Mall put on by those hotels. The free shuttle schedule and hotels it serves at can be found on the Dubai Mall website. The desert safari night is ok, about 220 dhs per person - well for adults. Did we enjoy it - yes. Did we expect more for our money - yes. Would we do it again - probably not. All in all it is an OK hotel, but not suited for an extended stay and because it doesnt have a pool you are forced to go to the beach in order to catch some rays. If your looking for a luxurious stay where its easy to get around then I wouldn't recommend the hotel due to its location and what it lacks - a pool but for somewhere to lie your head at night and sleep peacefully - its fine.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doha, Qatar", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for frequent travellers to Dubai\u201d", "Author": "imzy78", "ReviewID": "UR52160353", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights in August.
