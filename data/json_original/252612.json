The artisan market is also a 4-5 mins walk from the hotel. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was that they want the payment everyday morning.

It already starts with the arrive, the receptionist was extremely unfriendly, but not only him the whole staff terribly unfriendly. And this goes on with the hotel room. The room was clean and had proper internet. But this should be normal in a hotel. But the bed was rock hard, couldn\u00b4t sleep well there, sleep each night for 4 hours as well as my friend did, still have backpain. Actually wanted to stay there for a week, but after two night I had to skip the hotel and go to another one. So if you dont care about comfort and service this should be your hotel, but then you could also go to a hostel. It would be half price and you would probably get better service then in this so called \" hotel\" . My honest opinion: Please dont go to this hotel!

This trip I went out of my way to try to get somebody from the reception desk to smile, having read reviews that it didn't happen, and observing so myself last Septermber. Well, it WORKED!!

I'll talk about that one in a minute. The location is perfect. The restaurant offers good affordable food and they're open until 11pm. No complaints about the room itself, it was very big and clean, and what you would expect at a Holiday Inn type of hotel. I would also have to agree with the other reviewer that the television cable was not all that good and the computer in the lobby was a little outdated. However they do offer free wi-fi, if you bring your own laptop (which I would advise not doing). Nevertheless there are several inexpensive internet cafe's nearby. The staff was mediocre in my opinion and were not really that helpful or friendly. It seemed like most of the front staff were not happy to be there. That was one of my dislikes about the hotel, especially after staying with them for about 11 nights. They did not offer any type of discounts for extended stay visitors. Secondly, the actual exterior of the building itself isnt that attractive. Also no AC, but they did have a ceiling fan, which seemed to suffice. Finally, street noise is an issue if you are assigned a room facing the street, so I would reccommend opting for an interior room. The neighborhood iffy, and it seems that the Flemming sits right on the border of ghetto and safe-area. To the north, adjacent to the Park and Juarez Ave, there are other hotels and restaurants, and bakeries. The Sheraton Tower is in that direction and the metro, Starbucks, Zocalo, and all museums and sights are within walking distance. However, To the south, Be Careful! This is the area which is more industrial. It seems to cater to tradesmen, electricians and plumbers. About a week into our stay at the Flemming we came across another hotel- The Conde. This hotel is located in this industrial area, situated about 2 blocks south of the Flemming. Everything seemed almost the same, minus the restaurant and security glass seperating the front desk and clients. The room was standard, and at the amazing price of $18, we decided to give it a try for a couple of days to try to save some money. This is a decision I now regret. After coming back from shopping for about 6 hours, we discovered that our new laptop computer, Ipod, and expensive camera were stolen from the room. I had the key on me the entire day, and nobody else had access to the room, except for the Hotel Conde staff. Obviously they denied having any involvement, or knowing anything. Just the kind of thing you hear about in Mexico, \"I dont know anything\". Unfortunately, the police couldnt help much either. Of course its not the end of the world, but just a little bitter sweet reminder and lesson that trying to bargain hunt in Mexico City is not the most wise thing to be thinking about. Mexico is not the United States. That day we returned to the Hotel Flemming, and managed to have a great time for the rest of our stay. So I would definitely reccomend the Hotel Flemming to anyone, and plan on staying there again when I return this September.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, Maryland", "Title": "\u201csolid budget option, great location\u201d", "Author": "KevinShea", "ReviewID": "UR14521939", "Content": "This hotel is only two blocks from the Sheraton Centro Historico and about 15-20 minutes from the Zocalo.

Although the rooms are small, they are clean, well-furnished, and comfortable. TV, no AC, but did have a ceiling fan. There is an elevator. Beds are hard, but extra pillows are available. Staff were very responsive. The most awkward part about this hotel is the lack of e-mail or website. We arrived without a reservation but you can call them directly for a reservation, as they will find someone who speaks English to take your call. Bottled water is available for an extra charge. The restaurant is also a good value, with long hours. The neighborhood is in transition. To the north, adjacent to the Alameda, new hotels are under construction and Avenue Indepencia, 1 block north of the Hotel has lots of services including a good bakery and a DHL/shipping store where you can get boxes to pack your souvenirs even if you check them as baggage.
