Hotel is very nice, views over the port are amazing. Staff were very helpful and accomodating. The rooms and the bathrooms are also pleasant.

This included the water in my bathroom turning brown, smelling unpleasant and on two occassions stopping flowing altogether. Unfortunate as I was half way through my shower covered in soap!! The corridor that takes you through to the breakfast area has a BAD 'sewage' smell which remained throughout my visit and I was not the only guest to run through there, holding my nose. I have just returned and been to the Dr. today for an upset stomach (not eaten for 3 days in Spain as feeling too poorly) which I attribute to drinking the tap water (brushing my teeth) in the bathroom first few days of my stay before it had turned brown. The water was VERY heavily chlorinated at times at the start of my visit. This experience is unfortunate because it spoiled an otherwise very enjoyable stay at what is unquestionably a very nice hotel as other reviews will testify. That said, a quick google search when I got back showed that the problem with the water would be appear to be a recurring rather than an isolated incident. I hope that the hotel reads this review and acts upon it because this water issue is spoiling an othewise nice place to stay and I would not return unless I was absolutely convinced that the problem had been solved permanently.

This review will be short as I didn\u2019t want to stay at the hotel during the conference because of the bad organization which turned the hotel in a building with nice rooms but that is all. Although my better half and me only spend one night in the room, I hope this review will help. Dates of stays: Booked from march 2 to 5, 2012 Sleep one night, work from 2 to 5 in the day time. The Exterior: The building is very \u201cmodern\u201d but well integrated to the hill of Barcelona, Mont Juic. The Area: Perfect location is you want to chill out a bit out of town. A bus, 55, will take you downtown in around 25 minutes. A cab will cost you 10\u20ac. If you\u2019re looking for action, well you are not in the right spot. If you\u2019re looking for a nice place to rest and have a romantic week-end, it\u2019s great. The Interior: Very nicely arranged and decorated. The lobby is small with two desks for checkin/out. Stairs will take you to the lobby bar, which opens on a very large terrace facing the sea. Check in: The check in was ok. Difficult to comment as when you stay in a hotel hosting the conference you\u2019re attending you should expect some troubles. We were taken care of by a lady who helped a colleague for at least 5 or more minutes before talking to us while we were sitting in front of her waiting for assistance. We managed to get the key cards after having been warned that everything will be charged on the credit card right away with no refund option. Well, now I understand why as it\u2019s not the hotel handling the billing but the conference. Much to our surprise, we will discover that everything else would have to be paid in cash. The room: 316 I think this was a deluxe room. Quite nice with a very large king size bed, a small balcony with a sea and park view. On the balcony, only one armchair though. No way to sit for a romantic two person aperitif with my better half thus. The room has a long working desk, a big enough closet, a minibar and a flat screen TV. The bathroom is \u201cintegrated\u201d in the room, separated by a design curtain. Everything you can expect in a hotel of this category was there: bathrobes, slippers (but cheap though), sewing kit \u2026 The Bathroom: Separated from the bed room by a curtain, the bathroom is an open space with a egg shaped bath and a single sink. It\u2019s very nice looking but the bath is not so comfy. Design kills comfort sometimes. There is a separate shower, very large, with a hand shower and a \u201crain\u201d type one on the ceiling. The only problem is that when you shower with the hand shower, the ceiling one is leaking and you get some cold water drops falling during the entire time you spend in the shower. Both of us tried to avoid that, but we couldn\u2019t. There is a large toilet, separated from the rest of the bathroom by glass walls and door. The Bed: Excellent quality, very large, great sleep. The Breakfast: What can I say? It was totally stupid. Breakfast was between 7 and 9 AM. On our one and only morning there, there were only 18 people who came in time for the breakfast. 18 out of 400 attendees shows that none of us would expect such a short schedule for the breakfast. On top of that, as the restaurant was closed to host lounges for attendees, we had to cross a freezing corridor to end up in a sort of meeting room. At least the place was surrounded by the gardens, and the buffet although very limited was good enough. And you know what: that breakfast wasn\u2019t even included in the price of the conference apparently. Room Service: Well, again due to the organization, there was NO room service menu available. If you want to eat, you\u2019ll get the same limited sandwich choice than in the lobby bar and will have to provide prepaid tickets (in cash)! Check out: Long and complicated. 2 persons on duty to check out 400 people?! Wow, that was the icing on the cake. Fitness center/Wellness: Didn\u2019t even have the time neither the mood to check it out, sorry The Restaurant: Closed! Business center: I didn\u2019t visit, so I can\u2019t comment. I really liked: - The hill of Mont Juic is nice. There is a great promenade to do in the parks around the hotel. - The view on the city and sea, the nice back terrace of the hotel are very enjoyable. I really disliked: - As my better half and me were completely NON aware of the greedy organization, I will not put the blame on the hotel but on the conference. My conclusion: I\u2019m sure that this hotel is potentially a great choice. But they choose to sell their soul to greedy conference people. In our case it will make us keep a bad souvenir of our one night stay in the room and my 4 days stay in the rest of the hotel. Thanks for reading one more bad English review!

This hotel is ontop of a very high hill/cliff with stunning views of Barcelona. You can see the whole of Barcelona from the front of the hotel and many of the landmarks it has to offer... its simply breathtaking. The hotel entrance is hidden away under a small tunnel, and then their it is... and we both said OMG this s our hotel as the taxi pulled up as it is incredible. Straight away a porter was there to open the taxi door and take our bags to our room while another member of staff welcomed us and asked us to come and sign in. The staff are so welcoming, professional and anything you want or any questions you need answering they are 1st class. As we were escourted to our room all we could do is stare at the architecture of the hotel, the furnishings, and the amazing function rooms, gym, indoor pool, and spas. When we got to our room, our mouths hit the floor, is was the most incredible room and view we have ever got ( and we've stayed in a few pretty amazing las vegas hotels ). Our room was more of a suite than a standard room... huge bed, cd/ipod player that could play in the bedroom our through to the bathroom with a flick of a switch. A huge flatscreen, nice mini bar, a massive free standing deep bath, the shower and toilet were behind two seperate doors in the bathroom which was nice, and the sink had a huge mirror, and lots of free toiletries. There was also a walk in wardrobe, and a few comfy chairs. Our room was on the corner of the upper floor with views of the gardens on one side and a few of the pool and sea/port on the other. Our balcony had very comfy chairs and a table, and they supplied robes and slippers for free. The poolside is beautiful, the grounds are so well looked after, beautiful bushes/flowers, the sun loungers are so chic and comfortable, and the pool itself is perfect. This hotel although high up, feels so private, safe, and everything is onsite, so you dont even have to leave the hotel if you dont want to. Also at the back of the hotel is the cable car that takes you down to the beach.

The hotel bar could be such a great place, the views are perfect but for some reason the place is generally empty. If they could create a but of a buzz here it would be a fantastic place to 2. The hotel seems to have a general problem with water, when it rains staff need to put buckets at strategic points around the common areas as the rain come through the roof. Lucky for them that Barcelona doesnt get a lot of rain. In some of the rooms there is damp by windows or in showers. 3. The hotel breakfast is too expensive which is a real shame because it is a great location and their buffet is very good. 4.

Taking cleanliness and the nice spa as a given the most striking positive feature was the great staff. In my experience Barcelona unfortunately increasingly develops Parisien traits when it comes to hospitality and giving it an effort to actually make tourists feel welcome. The Miramar staff was a refreshing exception!

The balcony was of good size with comfy chairs, but was a shame that the shooting range was on the same side of our room and so was a little nosy. The bathroom was good with a huge rainfall shower cubicle and a seperate egg shaped bath next to a huge window. The sound system in the room was a nice extra. We had a couple of instances in which we had to talk to management. My husband bought some shower gel (which was about \u00a35 for a small lynx gel) as he had forgotten to bring his. On the second day we returned from our day out and couldn't find the gel which had been left in the shower cubicle. We called reception and it took a while for them to understand that the gel had been taken presumably by the maid as no one else had been in the room. They said they would look into it and come back to us. About half hour later we had a knock on the door and they had bought us some hotel shower gel. My husband explained it was his own gel that had been taken. They said that they had spoken to the maids and no-one remembered the gel but that maybe they thought it was finished or that we had checked out - which seeing as our other things were still in the hotel room and it was a full bottle of gel, didn't really stack up. We explained that at the end of the day it was only shower gel, but the more worrying thing was that it had been taken from our room. That evening, we had another knock on our door and the reception manager came to personally apologise and offered us breakfast the next morning on the house. We are not complainers normally but it was good that they had taken on board what we had said and tried to compensate for the error. Also on checking out there were some extra mini bar charges added that we did not have, so again had to explain what we did have and that the extra 15 or so euro charge should be removed. They tried to tell us that it would have been a bottle of wine. Well we didn't have a bottle of wine from the mini bar! We used the spa and gym facilities were good, but shame the jaccuzi's were split into the male and female changing rooms which meant my husband and I were not able to relax together. We ate in the hotel restaurant on our last night, which was a little pricey, but couldn't fault the food. It was beautifully presented and very tasty. Atmosphere was a little lacking as there was only one other family dining at the same time as us. Location was good if you like to get out of the hussle and bussle of the main city, but a bit out of the way if you like to be in the hub of things. Fine if you like walking! If we went to Barcelona again, we would probably rather stay in something like the Pullman or W which were situated nearer the beach and bars/restaurants on the nicer side of the city.

Besides the shots there were constructions in the entrance area that also produced a lot of noise.

But once you are in the hotel there is no alternative as the hotel is situated a bit outside the city centre. Service personel seemed to be overwhelmed a couple of times and very slow.

We opted not to take the breakfast at 20 Euros per person. The upgrade was well worth it, the views from our terrace were stunning.

Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try the outdoor pool, but it's a great place to just chill out. The entire hotel has a tranquil, relaxed ambience, and as we sat on our balcony, limousines and tour buses were bringing people up to enjoy the views from the area below the hotel. You are a bit out of the city, but not much (15 min walk) and buses (and the tour buses) go regularly past the hotel and pick up/drop off. On balance it is more than worth it for the luxury you get to enjoy. Negatives? Obviously expensive, we got a good deal off-season, but still paid through the nose for extras (bottled water at \u20ac8.80 etc) but that's only to be expected in the premium resorts.

In all the food and drink at the hotel was soooooo expensive, a burger and chips at the pool bar was 19euros! The pool area was very nice though with lots of space, loungers and umbrellas. The hotel is at the top of a very very steep hill, which is ok but in 40 degree heat can be a mission, but we did it and felt great at the top!

We found that after a busy day of sightseeing it was so nice to be able to retreat \"up the hill,\" away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We slept very well - not only is there not a lot of outside noise (although you do hear the cruise ships sometimes), the doors and walls are fairly thick, so there's not a lot of interior noise either. Views, of course, are outstanding. Furnishings and interior design are both mod and comfortable - not always an easy combination to find. Housekeeping staff was one of the best aspects of the hotel - they did a superb job without being intrusive, making up the room around our late morning/sporadic schedule, and providing a nice re-clean/turn down service. After the first day, when they noticed that a little kid was in the room, they added a plush child-sized robe to our bathroom. First time we've seen a hotel do that! Location - it is a bit out of the way. That has pluses and minuses. We felt that the views and serenity were worth it. It is a one block walk to the city bus (#50), so we got transportation cards and used the bus and Metro to get around. On the way back up to the hotel there is a funicular that takes you from the Metro stop (Paral-lel) to the street that the Miramar is on. We found that the bus doesn't stop at the funicular stop, so you have to walk the rest of the way. It's a few blocks, but a pleasant walk, past the Olympic swimming and diving pools that are nice to look at, and of course great city views. Sometimes going into the city we just walked down to the Metro instead of taking the 50 bus - that's a bit of a walk and there's nothing much to see on those streets once you get off the hill, but it is downhill and not a big deal.

Pros: Hotel was very nice and modern. The staff spoke pretty, good engish and were always friendly. We had a large room with an amazing view from our balcony. Thanks to the french rail workers we arrived at 3 am and the staff was incredibly kind and helpful even at that time of the mornng. The rooms had modern technology, including free wireless interne. There is a Barcelona tour bus stop right outside the hotel and the hotel will sell you discountd tickets so if you plan to do that activity it is very convenient. The gardens surrounding the hotel are beautiful as is the accompanying view all the way around the property. There are a couple restaurants across the gardens overlooking the port, neither of which are very good but the view is unbeatable. Cons: The hotel is at the top of a hill so to get to the port and most of the attractions in town you have to go down the hill - the bad part is the return hike up that monster of a hill. The lesson: take a backpack with everything you will need for the day. After 3 or 4 trips up and down that hill we were beat and we are both in pretty good shape. The hotel is a pricey for what you get, especially the express breakfast, which will get you about 2 croissants, a cup of coffee and a glass of orange juice for 10euros. Also, the restaurant is really mediocre and overpriced. I think they are trying to make it seem better than it is by requiring reservations. This was funny to us because when we entered the restaurant there were only two other tables occupied. After a leisurely 2+ hour dinner with drinks and dessert, the place was still half empty. The biggest disappointment we had was a 50 euro charge to check out 2 hours after noon. Seems like this should be a courtesy (especially when we were there becuase the volcano ash halted all air traffic so its not like they had many incoming guests). When we were checking out a couple of brits were literally yelling at the front desk staff about some incident with their laundry. The staff handled the situation pretty well.

None of us had anything to complain about during our 3 night stay. From the entrance, you are immediately impressed by the interior design by the local architects. And the hotel never disappoints with its interiors. Suffice it to say that all the 4 rooms were quite different from each other, and none of us was disappointed. Everything in the rooms was perfect - beds, living areas, bathrooms, amenities, etc. The view over the city and the port area is nothing short of stunning. The jacuzzis were, however, not in all the rooms, and all of them were tented. I'm not sure whether we needed to ask for it, or it was out of service - we didn't feel like taking an outdoor jacuzzi in early April anyway :) The hotel staff was always attentive and helpful, answering all possible questions and recommending things around the city. On to the downsides. The outdoor pool is really quite small, but the view from the sun deck is terrific. The breakfast is too expensive to my mind. But we found that ordering coffee with yoghurts and a basket of paistries in the room was quite enough for the beginning of the day, and costed less than a half of a breakfast price for 2 people. You have plenty of breakfast options in the city anyway. The location is both the hotel's strong and weak side. The view is absolutely fantastic, and the area is very quiet compared to Ramblas area for example. But it is quite far away from the city center. The air tram doesn't help much because from its next station there is still a lo-o-o-ong walk to the center. And the foot path is quite steep and about a mile long. We ended up using taxis for our trip around the city. Alternatively, you can use a day ticket for a sightseeing bus that stops right in front of the hotel. Montjuic area also offers quite a lot of sightseeing and pleasant walking. The hotel's restaurant is not really good. You'd be better dining off in the city. The final downside was the taxi to the airport. For some reason it costed us about twice more than the taxi from the airport to the hotel. It may have nothing to do with the hotel staff, but I've seen other reviewers here suggesting that the price difference was attributable to the commission for calling a taxi. It was no big deal, but I'd rather have my extra 20 euro with me. All in all we were very satisfied with our stay at Miramar (and a good discount for early booking quite added up to this!). But maybe it was also because we realized the pluses and minuses before booking it. For views, quietness and good interiors, this is your choice in Barcelona.

The room was spacious and comfortable with a nice balcony and the bathroom was BIG. Giant shower with 2 shower heads and a separate bathtub.

Bring your own hair conditioner as they do not provide this (nor did the other hotel we stayed in) and the blow dryer they provide is the best I have used anywhere.

The hotel is located just above the city and it is about a 7-10 minute walk down into the center of the city. Our 3 year old was able to walk into the city with ease, but we took a taxi back up the hill. (Tip: Taxi's in Barcelona only hold 4 people so we had to split up and take two unfortunately.

It is also located right next to the Fenicular (Sky tram) which you can take down to the sea. The hotel is very neat, clean and modern. I do not think you will find a better bathroom in any hotel in Europe. We were able to get rooms that joined by a short private hallway.

It is cool, modern but comfortable, and the staff were indeed young but very efficient nonetheless. Heard no guns or slamming doors. You need to be intrepid and tackle the funicular which is about a five minute walk away and that takes you down to Parallel metro station and joins you up with the very efficient metro network. It is extremely straightforward. 1.35 euros (or your debit card) in the machine at the funicular station and a single ticket takes you anywhere across Barcelona. Also you can pay on the buses rather than having to organise tickets beforehand, but there are very good deals to be had on books of tickets at the tourist kiosks. We did the Bus Turistica, which takes you on one of two routes around the city (if you want to see the bally football stadium you need the red one, otherwise the blue route is best) and as always it's a great way to get your bearings and see some of the amazing buildings.

I had booked a room on Expedia, and wasn't sure what kind of room we would get. Alejandra, our check-in clerk was very courteous, professional, and competent. Since we arrived around 10 A. M. after disembarking from our ship, our room was not ready. She did offer the use of the spa and pool, and helped us with additional orientation for sightseeing in the area. The room we had, #407, was exactly like the rooms shown on their website. The room and bathrooms were clean, comfortable and trendy. Sodas and water in their refrigerator were complimentary-- a welcome refreshment after wandering the streets of Barcelona in the summer! As others have mentioned, the hotel is out of the way, as it is the Montjuc area. Cabs were easy for us to get-- usually no more than a 5 or 10 minute wait. The front desk staff made the calls for us. Occasionally, there is a cab sitting outside the hotel, but note that if you need to have a cab called, the cab charges for the distance it has to travel to get to the hotel. We did not mind having to pay for a cab, since our rate on Expedia was such a good one. You can, if you want, avoid taxis if you take one the double decker tourist buses that stop half a block away from the hotel. Be aware however, that some of these buses go in a single direction on their circuit before they come back toward this hotel. As mentioned by other TripAdvisor reviewers, the breakfast buffet is expensive-- 25 euros. I would agree that this is not great value if you are traveling and converting back to U.S. dollars. Breakfast was satisfying, however, and had we not enjoyed the food on our cruise so much, we might have enjoyed more of the breakfast buffet. The view from the patio as the sun rises is gorgeous. Our waitress was also kind enough to find us some boxes we could use to pack some of the we knew would not fit in our luggage. I did go out to use the pool. I was a bit surprised to be told by the pool attendant/bar waiter that if I wanted more than one towel, I would have to pay extra. I looked into the pool and thought the pool grout needed cleaning. I ended up having a drink from the bar and reading the Financial Times instead of going into the pool. I liked the fact that this hotel was not in the middle of the city.

I would never recommend it to anyone. The hotel looks from all marketing material almost perfect and as long as you don't value customer service, helpful staff, security of your possessions or any amenities. It seems like someone designed it well and then left it to be fall to ruin. It would have been good to enjoy the spa, which looked great on the website but the steam room and jacuzzi were both broken. One place there was fresh running water was through the roof of the corridor outside and the roof just inside our room. Hardly the same. It just seemed as if they never thought to maintain the place. That is just one area of their obvious understaffing. Staff are there. If you can find them. Having to go into the restaurant every time you wanted a drink to find someone to come out and stand behind the bar was a little frustrating. It would have been lovely to have a drink at the pool but they won't come to you or serve to the pool. No, you have to go and wander around the restaurant in the hope of snagging someone who may begrudgingly man the bar and give you a tray to take drinks out yourself. There is a bar at the pool but it was 'shut today' every day we were there. The staff seemed almost annoyed that they had to talk to us. Not in a French way, which is sometimes cool but an awful, nonchalant, couldn't give a damn way. That also extended to the reception staff, the concierge (or lack thereof) and the assistant manager. This was exemplified by their attitude to the fact that three of our cars were broken into in the car park during our stay. The assistant manager immediately attempted to absolve the hotel of any blame, first by denying it was their car park (it's the one between the hotel sign and the hotel on a private road a few feet from the front door...hmmm). She then told me we should have parked in the indoor car park. We were on a rally so we took 30 cars, they could not accommodate this. Added to which, the entrance to the garage was steep and unusable to cars with low fronts. She them said that was because we should have told the reception staff we had a car (we arrived at a specific desk for a car rally). No one advised of it's existence on arrival. When I suggested that, having had a car broken into at a 5* hotel, the staff should notify other guests, she shrugged her shoulders. Even after a car had been broken into late evening, it took members of the group to tell each other and all have to be woken up to move their cars closer to the front door for security's sake. She claimed it wasn't the hotel's job to notify guests of such things. To add insult to injury, on arrival home it became apparent they had overcharged us for our stay.

Views were amazing, rooms nice and clean and out of town enough that it was quiet but not too far out that it takes too long to get to. An 8 EU taxi ride will get you to the hotel. If you want a hotel that is quiet and a good place to escape to then this is a nice hotel. The big issue with this hotel is management and front desk staff. I recommend you read the rest of this review choosing to stay here to make sure you avoid our situation. Although we booked and paid directly with the hotel 6 months prior to arriving, we were told upon arriving that they had not received our booking and that they had therefore made arrangements for us to stay at another hotel. They then put us into one of their sister hotel in the middle of the city. The other hotel was very disappointing. We managed to get back to the room we should have been in the next day. In the end it seems that they have a habit of over booking, swapping you to other hotels owned by the chain. The hotel manager managed to hide from us for the next 4 days and the front desk staff continued to lie about anything we asked and suggested that even though reservations had sent us an email confirming our stay it was not part of their system. So if you want to stay at hotel Miramar I highly recommend the following. After booking send an email directly to the hotel and state in the email that you are aware of what they did to the Burns Family during their stay from July 25th to the 29th . That you want an email confirming that you have a booking and that the hotel front desk will know about it when you arrive. Also ask for confirmation that you have a room with a view of either the city or port. It is only by letting them know that these unacceptable actions are now known by everyone that the hotel may change its approach to treating people with respect.

My boyfriend and I stayed for 4 nights at the beginning of July. I tried not to get my hopes up having read previous reviews but I have to say that on arrival I was really impressed with the hotel. The lobby is nice and modern and the room (classic room 303) was very large, with a separate room with toilet and bidet, separate bathroom with walk in rainwater shower and stand alone bath and then the bedroom/living room which was very spacious and a terrace with space for two chairs and a table and two sun loungers. We were convinced we must have been upgraded, but I don't think we had! We were at the back of the hotel so had no view, but that wasn't a problem for us at all. The pool area was absolutely gorgeous, surrounded by gardens and a great size pool. It was virtually silent up there for most of the day, apart from the subtle sounds of pigeon shooting in the distance. Loads of sunloungers, which didn't get taken until about midday anyway so no need to rush out in the morning to get one. The location was really nice, far enough away from the city to feel secluded and relaxed, but only a ten minute walk to the nearest metro (Parallel) or a \u20ac5-6 cab ride. Service wasn't amazing - but still polite and professional. All in all we had a really relaxing stay and were sad to leave - we will definitely be back again next time we're in Barcelona. There were a few small cons: The mini bar was only refeshed every two days. The hill to get back from Parallel metro was crazily steep - and I'm not afraid of walking. It only took about 5 minutes to walk up it but it is definitely a trek! We had to get a taxi back each evening - about \u20ac8-\u20ac10 from Villa Olympic area. The pool bar was hideously expensive and quite limited in choice - \u20ac12-\u20ac16 for a sandwich! Although the \u20ac6 cheesecake was amazing ; ) There was a cheaper bar, part of the hotel, a short walk away which didn't make very nice food but was better than the hike into town if you just wanted a quick lunch without moving far from the pool Breakfast was \u20ac25 per person. We didn't use this as paying close to \u00a345 for our breakfast between us seemed a bit over the top\u2026 There was also a smaller breakfast option of \u20ac10 for a coffee and pastry in the lobby. Barcelona tips: Go out without a bag if possible. I have been robbed before in Barca and we saw an unfortunate guy get robbed on the metro - he was standing by the train entrance with a big camera in his hand. His stuff was grabbed and the thief ran off before anyone had a chance to stop him. Keep valuables hidden and keep away from places where thieves can make a quick exit (like the door of a train, busy caf\u00e9\u2026) Take the metro to Jaume 1. There are loads of lovely tapas bars and mediterranean restaurants down the side street with Hotel Banys Orientals on it - you can easily spend a whole night there wandering in and out of bars. Try Balthazar restaurant near Hospital Clinic metro. It does great food at an unbeatable price. We had cannelloni and smoked salmon and lobster mousse for starters, shared a paella mixta for our main, one dessert, coffee and a bottle of wine and the bill came to less than \u20ac50! Also try Mayura for a fantastic Indian in a really stylish setting - again the bill was under \u20ac50.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but inconsistent service and poor internal communication between staff\u201d", "Author": "drawoha", "ReviewID": "UR33764061", "Content": "We spent a long weekend in the Miramar in late June 2009.

Setting: The Miramar is located in the Montjuic mountains, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The setting and grounds of this hotel are absolutely magnificent. The hotel has beautiful gardens that many tourists come to view (tour buses actually stop at this hotel). From one side of the Miramar (the back), the Mediterranean Sea is on full display; from the other side of the hotel (the front), all of Barcelona is visible. Location: Although not centrally located, the Miramar is within walking distance to everyting. In one direction is the Joan Miro museum (a 10 minute walk), the Olympic Stadium and the Montjuic Castle. A walk in the other direction (down the hill into the city) leads to Las Ramblas (a must see for anyone visiting Barcelona) and many other attractions (the aquarium, the Picasso Museum). Check-in: A breeze - after being offered refreshing ice tea and chocolate cookies at the front desk, we were shown to our room within 5 minutes by a lovely bellhop. Everyone who worked at the front desk was very helpful, both during check-in and throughout the duration of our stay. Room: Our room was very nice and had a modern decor - we had 1 queen bed and a second smaller bed, and a spacious terrace that looked out onto the Mediterranean Sea. The refrigerator in the hotel room is well-stocked and offers free water and soda (a nice touch). The bathroom was large and spacious (although it could have been stocked with additional toiletries). The rooms offer wireless service and satellite television. Restaurant: We enjoyed several light meals from the hotel restaurant (sitting outside on the hotel terrace, which overlooks the Miramar's gardens and the Mediterranean), and all of these meals were excellent (esp. the chocolate basket for dessert). Although we did not eat at the hotel restaurant (tempted instead by the many wonderful restaurants located in the heart of the city), we were advised that it was excellent. The restaurant offers a price-fix dinner for 25 Euros as well as a breakfast buffet. Health Club/Swimming: The Miramar has a health club and spa with a beautiful indoor pool located on the first floor (a flight up from the lobby) as well as a fabulous outdoor pool (complete with bar). Transportation: guests can pay (about 22-25 Euro/person) for a double decker tour bus that stops at the hotel and goes directly to all of the popular sites in Barcelona. The local bus (#50) also goes directly into town, and there is a train station close by. For those who like to walk or are looking for good exercise, the Miramar is approximately 15 minutes (walking briskly downhill) to Las Ramblas. The walk downhill is much more pleasant than the walk back to the hotel (straight uphill) after a day of sightseeing. For those who prefer a taxi, the front desk will order a taxi for its guests, and it is easy to hail a taxi in the city that will take you right back to the hotel (although not all taxi drivers know where the hotel is located).

It's an ultra-modern hotel built around a \"historic\" radio/tv studio with beautiful grounds. Mostly very classy, quiet guests. Room: Brand new, modern, sophisticated. We had a balcony overlooking the harbor (due to the economic \"crisis,\" as they call it in Spain, we got bumped up from a garden view, which would have been all right, too... but not as magical). Bathroom takes up half the room. There's only a sheer fabric screen separating you from the sink and tub... which some people wouldn't like. Toilet and shower are in separate opaque glass cubicles. Public Areas: Great bar with excellent club sandwiches and burgers with amazing french fries. Beautiful, glass-enclosed indoor pool. Staff: Very friendly and accommodating. Not too many of them, as the hotel was pretty empty most of the time during the current economic \"crisis\" (it fills up on weekends). Downside: At the end of the day, due to the location, we ended up hanging out in the bar and not going down into town. It's just easier. The outdoor pool doesn't open until April (then again, the weather doesn't really warrant it). This hotel is EXCELLENT and the people of Barcelona were great.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orkney", "Title": "\u201cService over and above the norm\u201d", "Author": "Scottishcari", "ReviewID": "UR23282336", "Content": "I can't praise the Miramar and the staff enough.

Perched half-way up a mountain overlooking the whole city and harbour, this cleverly-converted old post and telecommunications building provides a very chilled-out ambience. The welcome was slick and professional, rather than warm but they allowed me to park my Land Rover right in front of the entrance which was a plus. I had the cheapest room in the house -- at the back, overlooking wonderful botanical gardens with the sound of running water -- but it still boasted a spacious balcony with armchairs etc. In the lavish bathroom -- and it's a \"room\" not a cubicle -- the shower was huge and worked wonderfully, the bed beyond comfortable with wonderful silky sheets, the design and detailing of everything was exceptional. Total silence at night. Little things, like complimentary drinks in the mini-bar helped improve one's mood. Lunch on the terrace with a fabulous view, proved rather grand and just a tad formal, Customers were clearly well-heeled locals, rather than the t-shirt and shorts brigade. This is really quite a grand hotel and you pay the price when it comes to the extras. I share an earlier correspondent's reservations about absence of an intimate bar and having to beg for a drink in the lobby. But the quality of everything is exceptional.

Stunning. However the actual running of the hotel, the service and the atmosphere is slow and lacks warmth and friendliness. On both nights trying to have an early evening drink in the empty bar was a joke. We had to go to reception to ask to find the bar tender and when the drink came there was not so much as a peanut to accompany it. There was no service on the terrace and we had to go through the whole thing again when we required a second drink. The only lift to our room on the sixth floor was broken one evening so we had to walk and it remained broken the next morning. No one apologised for the inconvenience. Our bed was not turned down on the first night and our room remained unmade at 2.30 in the afternoon - four hours after we left it. On the morning of our departure an alarm call, booked with two separate people, failed to materialise and the taxi to the airport charged us an additional ten euros because he was called by the hotel tp pick us up. Very, very disappointing and not what one expects from a 5* hotel. We are not difficult or demanding - but these things tarnished what should have been a wonderful experience.

We were a bit concerned about the location on booking from previous reviews, however having stayed at this oasis we would only want to stay at the Miramar when we return again to Barcelona. After long hot days in the city you were grateful to escape to the hills for the seclusion and tranquility of the hotel. You can stroll down to the city in 10/15 minutes if you take the steps route(20 yards to the right of the cafe/restaurant Miramar).The road route is a lot longer. As for getting back (especially at night), then I would recommend that you just pay the 4 or 5 Euros to get a taxi back up. We found to our cost that you only hail a taxi in the direction that you want to go. They don\u2019t do U turns but instead will take you round the one way systems, quarter of an hour later you are back where you started from. Always have a map with the Hotel ringed as most of the drivers had no idea where the Hotel was located. The reception hands out excellent tourist maps. The rooms were very modern and luxurious with free soft drinks and beers in the mini bar replenished every day. The staff we found were very attentive and it only took 5 minutes for room service to bring up some pillows I had chosen from the pillow menu, and that was at 11.30 at night. Bad points ? There is a shooting range over the hill beyond the outdoor pool where the dull thuds could get on your nerves, but it wasn\u2019t loud enough or on long enough to get upset about.

A large stand alone bath large enough for two was the centrepiece of the bathroom. A Huge marble rain shower large enough for four made it the best bathroom in the world. A small error of design was that the door to the toilet cubicle was frosted, meaning it wasn't completely transparent but slightly. The sheets were silk, the pillows were the most comfortable I have ever rested my head. Some of the drinks in the minibar were complimentary as were three tins of cocoa covered treats. These were to die for. Breakfast was expensive and rather disappointing. Your options were limited and we were the only ones who were not offered coffee, but all of this is avoidable, just don\u2019t bother with the breakfast, or be prepared to pay more than what it is worth. If it was 10 euros per head I would say 'wow it was amazing' but at 25... it\u2019s a little steep. The outside pool area was lovely. Contemporary but on a lovely sunny day, very relaxing. Huge woven beds in the shapes of leaves surround the pool. Perfect for a cuddle with a loved one while soaking in the sun. A repetitive banging sound which I guessed was Clay Pigeon Shooting or similar was a little annoying.
