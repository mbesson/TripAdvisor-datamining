A little back story: My husband and I arrived in Amsterdam on New Year's Day, 2012 and discovered that the \"highly rated\" B&B we had booked two months prior was a complete and utter disaster. (long story, different review) After enduring one very dreadful night, I remembered that we had brought along an older (July, 2007) New York Times article of \"36-hours in Amsterdam\". Miauw was one of the suggested places to stay, so I immediately called and reached Analik. THANKFULLY, some guests had just checked out and Analik invited us to come on over - even though it was barely mid-morning and not even close to check-in time. Analik greeted us warmly when we arrived and took us up the two flights of stairs to view the apartment, which was still being cleaned after the previous guests. Even in an untidy state (seriously, how can people be such slobs?) we could see that the space was fantastic! At this point we realized how hungry we were and asked Analik for a coffee/breakfast recommendation. She suggested Screaming Beans, which was just around the corner. Great choice - good food and excellent coffee. Returning to the suite an hour or two later, it was as if we had walked in to a magazine spread! I won't repeat everything that other reviewers have rightly mentioned about how comfortable and well-appointed the space is, but I do wish to highlight a few things that made the White Suite so special: 1) The fantastic views from the windows - day or night. 2) Heated floors - these were absolutely wonderful to come back to after walking about in the cold and rain, and helped make the apartment incredibly cozy. 3) Location - so, so close to wonderful restaurants, bars, and excellent shopping ranging from unique boutiques to vintage. 4) Analik - even though we had just two days to experience Amsterdam, she listened to us when we described our interests and offered spot-on tips and suggestions. Like others, we were sad to leave Miauw Suites and Amsterdam - but we do hope to return one day.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful apartment in the best location in Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "beafoulger", "ReviewID": "UR122358509", "Content": "Miauw is one of the most beautiful holiday experiences we have ever had. Every detail has been thought of in the rooms. We stayed in the White Suite and loved the design, the views and the location. Super comfortable king size bed bed, spacious gorgeous living room with gorgeous big windows and views of the Keizersgracht, and a full working kitchen with a table big enough for us to host a small, home cooked dinner party for 5 of our local friends on the last night. The White Suite was always impecaably clean, and also has great details like a Bang & Olufsen TV, and lovely Ren bath products. We stayed just before Chistmas and the room temperature was always perfect, heat easily and quickly adjusted. There is an Albert Heijn (supermarket) literally 3 mins away, a great coffee bar just next door (Screaming Beans) and so many wonderful restaurants and bars to choose from. Analik is thoughtful enough to leave a few essentials in the kitchen like tea, sugar, olive oil etc so that you dont need to buy these things if, like us, you take full advantage of being able to cook your own meals in the gorgeous smeg kitchen! Maybe I am biased or somehow understood this immeditately beacuse I am Dutch, and originally from Amsterdam and know the area well -but I honestly I don't know how anyone could have gone to their website and thought that they were getting a full service hotel experience, they make it pretty clear that you are getting a very exclusive apartment! As far as other comments about showers being small and stairs being steep- you're in the Netherlands! Stay at home or in a big chain hotel if you don't want to experience or cant handle the quirks that make Amsterdam so special and quaint as a city (tall and not very wide houses!) My husband and I will only stay here from now on when we come visit and honestly cannot wait to return!", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cQuintessentially Dutch Experience\u201d", "Author": "GnT_xx", "ReviewID": "UR122342193", "Content": "To be honest, if you need to go to Amsterdam, try your best to stay here.

The temperature was around 90 degrees inside (despite being 70 outside) and there is no air conditioning. We were on our honeymoon and wanted to experience a boutique hotel but this was appalling in every way. We checked out straight away and found alternative accommodation close by that was very good.

The bed was very comfortable; the room was clean; the young woman Maya who showed us to our room was very helpful and nice; the building was on a canal. But the room/suite was probably not worth the price we paid. Given that there is no lobby or concierge service, we walked a block to the Hotel Pulitzer and used their concierge services. They were very helpful in arranging a day tour to Rotterdam, Madurodam, Delft, a flower market, etc. They also got us taxis once or twice. Several days after we returned home, I read an article in the New York Times about people getting paid $5 to write positive reviews about hotels or restaurants.

Like what others have said, dreamy and airy, bathe in white and subtle colors, with fresh flowers during our entire stay. We stayed for 4 nights. Two nights at the White Room, 2 nights at the White Suite. The suite is like having your own apartment in AMS, complete with a functioning kitchen, dining and living area, and a serapate bedroom.

Beautiful canals, nice boutiques, cafes, higher quality restaurants, etc. Miauw Suites is a unique property with 4 rooms of different design. I stayed 2 nights in the souterrain suite, and 1 night in the white room. The souterrain suite is a good choice if you want your own kitchen, and separate living space. The white room, despite being smaller, was somehow even more charming with the high windows and canal view. You get a little more street noise in the white room, but I am sensitive to noise, and it did not bother me. I slept great in both, and I would stay in either room again. If you want to feel like you have your own apartment in what I consider to be the best area of the city for walking along the canals, this is a great option. In this area of the city I have also stayed in hotel ambassade, and hotel estherea. My personal preference is Miauw out of those three choices, but Ambassade is also a good property.

Ok, I will grant you that the baths were a tad small (and frankly a bit weird) and there was no closet in the white room. But both rooms were truly a unique experience. We felt like we were staying in our own place or as guests to a friend's house, not in a hotel. And the location was simply fabulous.

I would go for the larger suite which is the whole floor of two attached town houses. The bathroom is smallish but really there are so many pluses like the all white interior and cool furniture and lamps; it all looks like an apartment you find in designer magazines. The kitchen was amazing and very elegant and cool. Also included is a Mac and internet which makes everything so much easier. Also I should mention you will have to tackle very steep stairs with your luggage so keep this in mind before booking. We would be definitely staying again.
