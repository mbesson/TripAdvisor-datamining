We stayed for 1 night in a 4 person room with no bathroom. Small, sweltering room with a severe lack of ventilation and facing onto an extremely noisy street in frankfurts redlight district. For a few dollars more next time i think we will stay in a hotel (e.g. hotel apollo) rather than this place again.Pros:-------- Very close to frankfurt HbF and lots of facilities at hand (pub, fast food, cash points, supermarkets, sex shops)- Clean, bright rooms- Clean Shared bathrooms- Cheap  Secure with 24hr receptionCons:--------- Hordes of homeless people, drug addicts and general low-lifes making one hell of a racket in the street front (at the flop-house across the road from the hostel) 24hrs a day. Its a hilarious street-show out your window at 3pm but at 3am its pretty annoying = no sleep!- Sex-show nightclub on groundfloor right next door to hostel entrace playing horrible techno music til 4am = no sleep!- No airconditioning or climate control whatsoever in the teeny tiny room means that you have to open the windows to stop from sweltering in the humid german summer conditions. Closed window = sweltering room = no sleep! Open Window = noisy street activity = no sleep!- Unenthusiastic, indifferent front desk staff you need a shoehorn to prise a smile out of let alone any useful information about the surrounding area!", "Date": "Aug 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR739181863", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SOD_WF"}, {"Content": "Easy access Went to Frankfurt for a couple of days and we were looking for cheap and convenient. This location offered both. It is only a couple of blocks from the Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof (Central train station) and although the streets are lined with sex shops, there is a heavy police presence and I never once felt unsafe walking down the street. The rooms are nice and clean and have very interesting color choices. Shower and toilet in the hallway, but these were also nice and clean. The elevator works fine, but is VERY small.", "Date": "May 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR839919234", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KaiGywer"}, {"Content": "clean and adequate       clean and recently renovated", "Date": "Mar 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR683387348", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "OzExpat"}, {"Content": "Viel zu viel Geld f\u7709r wenig Hotel   showReview(15578677, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR209733103", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Bien sympa et efficace   showReview(14737005, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR730854723", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d1006764-r19278976-Easybed24-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "1006764", "Price": "$159"}}
