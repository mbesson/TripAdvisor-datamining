The computer in the room is very convenient and a big help to us because I was robbed and had to rearrange my finances via home. But when they say small rooms, they mean it. Really, really small. In fact you can't fit two suitcases in the double room. We had to store one under the bed and keep the other closed and standing upright. Bit of a nuisance. The other problem was the smell from the bathroom. We complained and they fixed it for a day - but it came back. It may be just that the plumbing can't cope. I noticed a reviewer complained about the taxis - but the hotel called them for us when needed and they came right to the door. No problem.

My experience in 2012 was much different than mt stay in 2001. I had booked the same type of room, but was given a very small room in the corner of the hotel. The quarters were extremely tight for my husband and I. Other family members that we were traveling with had booked the 4-person room. The quarters were also a bit tight but had a balcony with a great view. Our bed had the side of it up against a wall, so you could only get into the bed from one side. There was less than 3 feet of walking space in the room. Even the shower was tiny. You have to squeeze your knees into the shelf under the sink in order to sit on the toilet. We visited Madrid in May 2012 and it was 90 degrees all week during our stay. The hotel did not have any air conditioning on and it was EXTREMELY HOT in the room. We called the front desk and asked them to turn on the air conditioning and they advised that they \"were not aware that the weather would be so hot and would be turning on the air conditioning the next day\". It was very difficult to sleep because the window opened inward toward the room and the corner of the window was 3 inches from my head when I was laying in the bed. I was scared that I would hit my head on the corner of the window if we kept it open. We asked to change rooms and they advised us that it was not possible. One of the windows in my room opened into a cement wall! The air conditioning was finally turned on. Now, there are also good points to this hotel. The main positive attribute is the location. This hotel is one block from SOL, the center for all of Madrid's biggest parties, festivals, parades, pep rallys, and demonstrations. We saw a number of amazing sites in sol just by chance while walking to & from our hotel. We walked right into the Team Atletico pep rally, the San Isidro parade, & the \"Occupy Madrid\" demonstrations.

I suspect a normal taxi would have dropped us off somewhere near Sol metro station and expected us to find the hotel ourselves. The room was small to say the least. The bunk bed was against the wall and there was no safety bar for the top bunk. The twin beds weren't particularly comfortable.

It was a safe hotel which is needed considering all the craziness that goes on in sol. It was always noisy with performers, drunks and teenagers partying wee hours of the night.

The room looked pretty shabby and I've stayed in some bad places. We decided to give it a chance because we were excited to get out and explore Madrid night life. The shabbiness included cigarette burns, wardrobe ready to fall apart, tiles/laminate peeling/separating, wallpaper coming off, floor boards sagged under foot (I weigh 115), the two twin beds were more like poking spring torture devices and last but not least the walls/door were so thin that it sounded like people were in your room. Including a puking neighbor and some persistent visitor who felt like knocking continually for five minutes would yield results. The dude may have been puking because of the persistent awful cabbage stench but I'll never know for sure. We got zero sleep but did discover some great late night Spanish soap operas.

Check-in was simple and the lift, while small, does the job. We did not try any of the breakfast offerings as the price is just too high for family travel. Besides, the location is steps away from any kind of food...from American fast food chains to classic Spanish places, in addition to a coffee shop/bakery/ready-to-go food/cafe and supermarket at the El Corte Ingles as well as the amazing market next to Plaza Mayor. There's simply no need to eat-in the hotel when such a dizzying array of choices for all budgets awaits. I'd previously communicated with the hotel desk manager and, following her advice, requested a family room facing the inner courtyard, we instead got a corner room right on all the action. In fact, I'm glad of it, because the inner courtyard seemed to be little more than a vertical alley lacking in any charm or ambiance. Our room, however, featured 4 balconies (which thrilled our 6-year-old to no end)--including one in the bathroom (useful, given Spaniards lack of exhaust fans in bathrooms). The windows seemed insulated and with the air conditioning on, the lively street noise was not excessively irritating. Our visit coincided with Madrid Orgullo Gay 2011 (gay pride) and there was quite the party happening late into the night of 2 July. The other two nights of our stay were quite quiet by comparison. The room itself, while compact, was well laid out and contemporary in design and furnishings. As I've found to be the rule rather than the exception in Spanish lodgings of all star-levels, the room was clean and cleaned well. There was a large king sized (two singles) bed and a pull out couch. As one who slept on the couch, it was perfectly adequate for my size, although I expect a person 200-pounds plus might find it uncomfortable. The in-bathroom exercise bike seems really unnecessary, given the lack of space, and that the left pedal was missing. Speaking of unnecessary, I realize that's a European thing, but as traveling usually requires some sacrifice of the conveniences of home, must every hotel room bathroom include a bidet? They take up a good amount of space and the South American native with whom we traveled didn't care for the idea of using a bidet used previously be strangers (they were not emblazoned with a sanitized banner as were many of our toilets).

A glimpse into one of the corner rooms on passing showed that some of their rooms are actually a decent size. You gets what you pays for I guess. There was also a very small shower cubicle with a multi-function shower contraption that occupied a third of the limited space. Finding the place could also prove difficult for some travellers with an inauspicious entrance in a side street.

The laptop was great, made it super easy to check in at home via email. I was not able to get the wireless to work but I did not try very hard. We did not realize you had to insert your key into the door to get the power to work - a quick trip downstairs cleared that up and the AC was great - even got chilly one night and had to turn it up. The location was very central to walking to Madrid's historic sites and just 2 blocks from the subway for longer distances. Unfortunately Plaza del Sol is all torn up with construction for a new railway station. I think this would have been an even better location if the Plaza had been opened and there were more resturants and patios in the area. Every one we met at the front desk spoke very good English. I had to leave a day before my husband for a business trip and they arranged a cab for me the night before. The cab picked me up right outside the front door - I saw some reviews that said cabs could not drop them off out front but this was not the case. We took the subway in from the airport so not sure if the drop off is different - maybe if the driver does not know the area? A few negatives - the lock to the bathroom broke one evening and I got locked inside with out my clothes. Luckily my husband was able to toss me some clothes over the balcony before he ran downstairs for help - I was out in less than 5 minutes.

We had reserved a standard double room online and were given a room with a double bed and a balcony overlooking one of the main pedestrian walkways, which was nice since we like to see what's going on. The room was not one of the smallest you might read about in other reviews. There was enough space to walk around and the Internet access was great (you pay a deposit for the cord), but we did have a little trouble finding enough space for our clothes, etc. The bathroom was small, but nice and the room was clean and nicely decorated. The bed was firmer than we're used to, but we slept well and comfortably. One night we woke up very hot and realized the A/C wasn't working. I went down to the front desk to let them know. No one came right away, but it started working again around 10am (even though no one had come to work on it). Much later in the day when we returned they said it had been fixed and we didn't have a problem again. Several have mentioned that the front desk staff do not speak much English. In our case we found that one did not, but two others did. One important piece of information about getting to the hotel. It is in a pedestrian only area and another review says that taxis can drive in, but as hard as I tried, ours wouldn't. He took us to Puerto del Sol to the end of Calle de Preciados, then he showed us on a map that Calle de Galdo (the street of the hotel) was the second street up on the right. He was right. It was extremely close and not a problem if you know where you're going. We were never completely sure that taxis were allowed to drive in either. We saw many people walking in with luggage to other hotels and then the day we were leaving a taxi driver appeared to be getting a ticket for something right outside the hotel.", "Date": "June 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat location; watch your room assignment\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5184974", "Content": "Great location, clean rooms. When my wife and I checked in, the two other guests in line at the front desk BOTH complained that their rooms were not what they reserved. Sure enough, when we got to our room, it was a smaller room than we reserved. We convinced the staff of the error (thanks only to the printed Expedia confirmation), and they asked that we spend one night in the smaller room and to leave our luggage packed the following morning. The next morning, staff dutifully moved our luggage for us while we were out. The bigger room was an exterior room with an excellent view down Calle de Preciados towards Puerta de Sol. Otherwise, the hotel was in a great location and was clean and comfortable. The bathrooms are smaller and the beds are harder than most from \u201cnew world\u201d are used to, but the rooms are quite hospitable. The staff was polite and helpful.

Great location, 1 minute from Placa del Sol & metro stop...had to sleep w/windows open due to no a/c in March (although weather was upper 60's); not on a street w/cars but still very noisy. Nice bathroom upgrades but small. Would recommend for budget traveler, our room slept 4 (2 beds folded down from the wall like bunks) & was only 95 Euros per night! Location & cost outweighed noise in the wee hours. Free internet access...we didn't do breakfast here as it was over $10 per person. Major chain store (El Corte Ingles) was directly across from hotel and has a supermarket where we bought donuts and juice and kept it in the minifridge. We also bought bread and lunchmeat for picnics. WE fed 5 people (including 2 grown men & 1 teenage boy) for about $15 total each day for breakfast and lunch COMBINED. Eating at Burger King/McDonald's, etc was about 25-30 euros for 5 people PER meal.

The free in-room internet access was great, I was able to find a translation site and write notes to the staff. The breakfast buffet was good with scrambled eggs, various meats, and fruit (some fresh, some canned) each morning. I did have some problems with things breaking. The shower broke twice and the back came off my desk chair. They didn't fix it the first day but after I typed up a note they did fix it. My room did not have a balcony. The windows did open, but onto an internal courtyard that was very dark and had nothing but concrete and construction materials at the bottom. With the windows shut no light at all came into the room, it was impossible to tell if it was day or night unless you opened a window.

The first stay was for three days and the second for one night. The hotel is very nice in a great location for shopping and access to transportation. Being just off the Puerta del Sol we were able to catch the bus or grab a taxi quickly. The front desk staff were very helpful and pleasant to work with. My only complaint is that they were not able to get us our rooms quickly after we arrived. The first time it took nearly two hours to get our room even though the guy told us 30 minutes (we waited in the lobby). The second time was about one hour. Both times we arrived well after normal check-in time. Although the lobby is very smokey the rooms we had were very nice and not smokey at all. Not real large for a triple room (double with an extra bed) but still managable. Our first room had enough space for the third bed to be set apart from the other two but the second room was much smaller with all three beds pushed together. Smaller bathroom in the first room with a bathroom nearly the size of the bedroom in the second. Still both were fine. The balconies in the rooms were very nice with a view of the street below (shopping area, pedestrian only). It was a bit noisy until approx. midnight which was a bit frustrating but still not enough to keep you awake. The rooms were very clean and the marble bathrooms made the room look much more expensive than what it was. One word of advice if you are having a taxi deliver you to the hotel... although it is located on a 'pedestrian only' street, taxis are able to drive in and drop you at the door of the hotel. Our first taxi driver did this but the second would not since it was pedestrian only. Just tell them they are able to drive in and drop you at the door. Also, if they are not able to find it just go to the Puerta del Sol and it is just behind the bus stop and beside El Corte Ingles. The breakfast buffet was included and was nicely stocked with traditional breakfast foods, fruits and plenty of bread. A very nice beginning to the morning. There was also free internet access in the 5th floor lounge which was a plus as my daughter was feeling very homesick. Overall a nice place to stay for the money.

We needed to leave bags as we were taking a train to Seville for a few days and they were accomodating about this. Also, they made arrangements for tours with no problems. The free Internet accessibilty in the hotel was very nice; after all, this is an inexpensive hotel by European standards. Room was small but we had two adults and two teenagers and so we had the normal twin beds pushed together and then a bunk bed--not the best thing but it worked for us.

I loved the contemporary look of the hotel. The negative part was that the front desk hardly spoke English, something that the employees in tourism are expected in Spain and that they were not service oriented at all, even rude at times. Our 1st night there, when we tried to use the jacuzzi, it didn't work. I called the front desk, and told them about it. They said that they would send somebody in the morning to fix it. Next night, we tried the same... the button didn't work. I called again and the \"gentelman\" at the front desk almost yelled at me and said that they did send somebody and \"Maybe I didn't know how to use it\" (How rude!)
