The reason is I wanted to stay at the hotel which is quiet yet good located but it was not always possible in Dubai. Most of the 4 star hotels are very loud, if they have night clubs and bars in it, so for the good rest one should look either to stay at 5 stars or 4 stars DRY hotels (all 4 stars dry hotels DON'T have a night club). Apart of that, this hotel apartment is just 3 minutes walking distance from Deira City Centar (one of the popular shopping malls) and has excellent clean and very spacious rooms and apartments, some of them with beautiful view over the Dubai Creek. Since there is so much driving involved, I found extremly practical to be located at the Creek side, and there are other nice hotels in this area. My absolute recommendation for the location and confort of this hotel, whether you are visiting for a business or leisure", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hampshire", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "pompey1001", "ReviewID": "UR48115832", "Content": "We got a good deal on this hotel, where we stayed for 10 nights. The good points are that the studio apartments are clean and well equipt. They are spacious. There is a bus stop very nearby and the metro ( of course taxis are very cheap. The staff are helpful and friendly.) You must be aware though that they are building a hotel next door, and although we never heard any banging, we were on the opposite side of the hotel, I imagine it would be awful if you were right next to the hotel. I was informed that currently half of the hotel is not let out. The pool is lovely and quiet, but then it is overlooked by the builders. You do get used to this though. Take an i pod to block out the noise. The fire alarms went off at least 4 times when we were there and I was a little nervous, because one never would know if it was a false alarm. The alarms are very sensitive. We were on the 13th floor, at the very top and although I would return to this hotel , I would prefer to be no higher than the 5th floor. So book it, but ensure you are not next to the building site and you will have a super time.!!", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous...\u201d", "Author": "SleepyKuri", "ReviewID": "UR38959888", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Star Boutique and it was amazing!

We didn't use the restaurants, but did have room service once which was quick and the food good. Our dishwasher didn't work, but they brought us some fairy liquid and for the little we needed to wash up it didn't matter - what we left on the side in the morning was washed up when we came back in the afternoon.
