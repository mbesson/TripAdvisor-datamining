It was bright, cheerful and comfortable, with a fun rooftop patio where you could watch the world go by. We got a discount rate, but it's worth paying a few extra dollars for. The other rooms look a bit plain and even dreary. I was ready to look elsewhere, but the penthouse room almost seemed to belong to a different hotel. There are a lot of stairs (and not always anyone around to help with bags), and it's a bit noisy at night. There seems to be a bit of soundproofing, and earplugs (or perhaps air conditioning) mostly solves that problem. As the previous review mentioned, I saw a few ants crawling up the doorframe in the bathroom, but none in the room, and certainly not enough to be disturbing. I don't know who the previous reviewer dealt with, either, because we only encountered one very nice, helpful lady who spoke excellent English. We arrived last-minute, and I looked at 3 other moderate hotels in the area. This one (at least the penthouse room) was by far the nicest for the price.", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Torreon, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cawful treatment and plague\u201d", "Author": "ALOM87", "ReviewID": "UR91851584", "Content": "We were planning to stay at this hotel, we had our room and all, and as one of us was about to take a shower she screamed, the reason? lots of flying ants were crawling around, over the walls, ceiling, floor and curtains. We went down stairs to management and they sent someone up to clean, they sprayed some insecticide and that killed them, apparently. A few minutes passed and as i now tried to take a shower, to my surprise it was filled with those ants once again, and lets face it, they're not the worse plague ever, but their bite sure hurts, so we complained in management once more and they changed our room to a much smaller one when we had the big room with 3 individual beds and a large bed. They changed us to a smaller room with 2 beds, of course paying the same price as the large room, which we didn't agree to, so we went to management to tell about our inconformity with the price, that it should be lower if the room was smaller and the manager said, well take your money back so rude that we couldn't believe our ears. I had to ask again, excuse me, did i hear correctly, are you kicking us out, he said yes, i can't do anything for you, our cleaning staff is out for the day, and i said that this wasn't a cleaning problem, the problem was that there was a plague crawling through the window, he just turned his face and ignored us, so i left, looked for the nearest hotel from there and checked out of there. As we went to get our money back we demanded to speak to the manager again cause he would give us the money, he sent someone else to do it. The last thing i wanted was to tell him that that wasn't the way to treat his guests, he snaped at us and started nagging and telling us that he couldn't grant us our extravagances and that we couldn't handle one small ant, of course all this time making faces at us, OMG, i was stunned that the man was actually talking to us that way, we said, look, it's not one ant, it was a plague ok? and really if you're not comfortable with your job its not our fault that you have to treat your costumers this badly and we left. Really, after the way that man treated us I really hope he's not working there anymore because one bad person is all it takes for people never want to go back to a place like that,", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manitoba", "Title": "\u201cAffordable and Clean!!\u201d", "Author": "SunKisstManitoba", "ReviewID": "UR56597614", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from playa del carmen yesterday.

I chose them because they offer free internet, well so their website and desk clerks say. They do not. I was looking for an extended stay while I look for an apartment and I had to have internet to work. When I checked in that night the person working did not know the password. No big deal I could wait until morning. In the morning I was given a password, but there was no internet connection. I tried two connections that were not the one that they told me, but as I figured the password did not work because it was not the hotel's. I have notified them of this and I was told that the internet works best in the lobby but does not reach me room at all. Kind of defeats of purpose of having internet in rooms advertised. I wasn't able to get a connection in the lobby either. Other than the it was good. Basic Mexican hotel. Clean, no frills, inexpensive and great location and friendly staff.

Staff wasn't extremely helpful as some reviews stated. The room was clean, had A/C and was inexpensive compared to other hotels in the vicinity. My main complaint is the photos on the Hotel Delfin website shows a penthouse, which we reserved, but there are two other penthouses and the other one we saw was not the one represented on the website. In addition, the \"ocean view\" was a view of rooftops and a bit of the ocean. The patio area is separated from the other penthouse with a stick fence and has no shade. We stayed in room #19. I don't recommend it if you have expectations of it looking like the photos!

One kind goes to places like Mexico and goes to places that, besides the warm beachers, could be the US. The food is Mexicanized, so there are tacos and such, and you can go with little interaction with what's happening locally. Playa Del Carmen is a rocking city. There are hundreds of restaurants, including one in a cave. There are many fun shops and people come from all over the world. There are far more Canadians and Italians there than US Americans. Hotel Delfin is located right on the main street of town, so you just walk out the door and you in in the middle of the fun. It is 1/2 block or so from the beach, so if you want to hang out on the beach, it is right there. The hotel is solidly built, so if you decide that all the activity in the town (many nightclubs, music venues, and general fun) is a bit much and you want to get a good night's sleep, it is no problem, inside it is clean and quiet. In an all inclusive, you might be anywhere, but if you experience Playa Del Carmen, you will never forget it.
