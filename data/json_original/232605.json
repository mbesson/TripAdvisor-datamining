Modern hotel. Very helpful receptionists. We paid 95 euros a night including breakfast. Breakfast was continental and cooked, very good selection. I think it's probably used more as a business hotel. Very clean, good sized hotel room, shower /bathroom good size. Can't fault it. 5 mins walk away are bars/restaurants. We walked everywhere from here and didn't think that it was too far out, obviously you could use tram/metro but we chose to walk. Would recommend staying in this hotel.", "Date": "Oct 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR908006715", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "angelina_alix"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d232605-r7481907-Hotel_Joachimshof-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "232605", "Price": "$208"}}
