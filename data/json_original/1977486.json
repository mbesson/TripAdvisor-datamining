Service is excellent, staff available all times. Rooms are always clean. We had one with a sea view which was great. Also 5 minutes walk to the seaside. As this is a small hotel with only 2 rooms on each floor there was no noise problems. Only issue is if you want to go to the sultanahmet area it is about 12 - 15 minute walk away.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankara, Turkey", "Title": "\u201ckomfor, cooking, holiday:)\u201d", "Author": "muhammet a", "ReviewID": "UR124257757", "Content": "Turkey is also one of the rare places for lodging and cuisine to everyone recommends, in particular, I would like to try to interest to Ercan Bey. thanks.", "Date": "February 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cexcellent hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Gamze A", "ReviewID": "UR124249895", "Content": "I stayed a week at this hotel,very clean rooms,very nice breakfast.Thank you very much all about helped by ercan.

UNWORTHY OF ANY TRY EVEN IF IT IS FOR FREE. THIS PLACE CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS A HOTEL AT ANY STANDARD. LOCATION: Very bad in Komkapi area, which is very low quality and full of house factories, even a shoe factory is located adjacent wall to wall to this hotel, creating unberable noises from 7am to 10pm. Also should not be surprised if you are welcomed by a RAT passing by the main entrance. HOTEL: Very bad staff, especially the manager OSMAN as he is unamiable, unhelpfull at all, unprofessional and useless by all means. Staff are not appropriate for a hotel and does not speak other than turkish. ROOM: Very noisy unberable. Aircondition does not provide cooling at all, constant problems with the bathroom, no views at all facing old shabby smelly neighberhoud of houses & factories, very poor quality of housekeeping and not regular. Indeed the rooms are not suites type as the name misslead. SERVICES: Falce and untrue infos in all webs about this hotel - No Free Parking. No Restaurant. No Business Center. Very bad Breakfast area and quality. Very dirty, unclean and unhealthy. GENERAL: This hotel must be removed from all listings, as it is very unqualified and disapointing. This place is a total monkey business in every aspect. RECOMMENDATION: Never book / stay at this place, as you will definitly end up with a disaster experience as we did by making a fully prepaid booking through Expedia. Area recommendations Any other area than the area of the hotel (Kumkapi). Other Must AVOID booking at this (Amber Suites Hotel). It not worth at all even if it is for free.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austria", "Title": "\u201cClean but noisy and (very) overpriced\u201d", "Author": "Aemilianus", "ReviewID": "UR102897569", "Content": "Amber Suites is a very small hotel (only 10 rooms) but nevertheless quite noisy at night and day. If you want a good sleep -forget about it! Hotel lobby and the rooms smell vaguely of sauerkraut. Breakfast is rudimentary and people are allowed to smoke (actually also staff smokes during breakfast). Location is good but the hotel itself is located on a non-descript street with some serious traffice. Isolation on windows is good but noise still penetrates. Beds and pillows are quite uncomfortable. For all this you pay 150 Euro per night which is the deal of the century (for the owners). One has to say however that the hotel has a very nice web site which has nothing to do with reality.It is also clean and the staff is nice. Internet is also fast and free. Overall - a could-be-worse overpriced 3 star hotel with too menay negatives to recommend.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfect...

Na\u00c3\u00afve, I know. But it looked so impressive at a good price near the Sultanahmet area. First off, this particular area of Istanbul is a labyrinth of narrow twisty roads & backstreets that taxi-drivers taking you there find it easy to take you the wrong way, whether accidental or not and bump on an extra 15 TL. 2) The area is very shady at night, we managed ok but I didn't truly feel comfortable, mainly due to the difficulty in navigating around. 3) We tried all 3 rooms available: 201, 001 and the basement room. They are all very nicely done up to be fair. The bathrooms are especially nice. All three were a touch dark, and were next to a non-stop carpet factory. The noise was unbearable, like being next to a building site. Coincidentally, the hotel's other neighbour is actually a building site. The staff are very helpful and friendly, cannot fault them.
