The hotel was very central in terms of location; all resturants and other shops were literaly at the door's steps. Famous Istiqlal shopping streets is only 2 minutes away and Taksim-Kabatash underground station is just infront of it. Our room was very small but it is worth to mentions how modern, clean, and orgnised it was. More importantly, the bathroom was large and truly modern in its decoration. Breakfast, however, was very limited in selections and I did not like the fact that to order Omlet eggs it would cost you 8 Turkish Liera! Another bothering point was the single lift that took long time to serve all the floors and therefore it was very normal for us to wait for at least 5 minutes to ride it. In general, the tidy rooms, friendly staff, and central location haave all compensated the negative 2 points I just mentioned. I recommend it for those who like to be out at the busy nights of Istanboul and would prefer to be in city centre.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuwait City", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Hotel, Fantastic Location\u201d", "Author": "hotelhopper87", "ReviewID": "UR124708379", "Content": "This was my first trip to Turkey and I didn't really know what to expect. The negative reviews on this hotel are all mainly from before they had it renovated. I was there for New Year 2012 and all I can say is that this hotel was absolutely fantastic. The staff were very friendly, rooms very clean and tidy, and best of all is the location which is right on Taksim Square and parallel to Istiklal street. I had stayed with a friend in a standard room which had twin beds. The room was quite small but still very comfortable. Our stay included free WiFi and free breakfast which was alright. The variety wasn't much but it was still a great way to start the day.

We had chosen alkoclar keban because of its close proximity to taksim square and because the rooms appeared to be of a very good standard for the price. Upon arrival, we were very pleased with our choice! The hotel is in an excellent location, literally 5 doors away from the start of istiklal street in taksim sqaure. The rooms are very classy with brand new fittings, beds and furniture and are extremely clean and look exactly like the professional pictures which appear on the hotels website. Having previously stayed in the five star elite world hotel in taksim sqaure, I can honestly say that the rooms are of the same standard. Our room had a minibar/fridge, kettle with tea/coffee, tv (with 4 channels- all in turkish), and a safe however the website states that rooms have a microwave but this is definitely a misprint! we stayed in the family room which had two single bed and one large double bed. Rooms also had free complementary wi-fi, however the connection was very slow and often tempermental. The bathroom was grey marble, very clean, with new and very fancy fittings including: a large marble sink, bidet toilet, a rainshower head and a hairdryer. However, when using the rainshower head, water often leaked onto the tiled floor which was the only downfall. The buffet breakfast would be served between 7am and 10 (30) a.m and was slightly varied each day with a selection of around 4 hot dishes, often: scrambled eggs, arabic cheese/spinach pastry, (halal) sausages and a meat/egg stir fry. The buffet also included a selection of cheeses, dried fruit and figs, olives, yoghurts, cereals and breads with complementary cherry or orange juice, tea/ or turkish style coffee (however, all drinks had to be to ordered seperately through a waiter). The service: The hotel staff were all very friendly and always on hand however, it was extremely difficult to communicate with daytime staff since they neither spoke nor understood english. it was really difficult to communicate something as simple as wanting some milk for our tea or that we needed 2 clean glasses (we were instead brought 2 tea bags to our room?!). This however became less of an issue as we later discovered that the kind man who worked on reception during the night and the male manager who worked in the back office during the day were much more fluent in english. if we needed help with locations or directions during the day we found that staff in the taksimhill hotel (further down the street, just before the corner facing the metro) spoke excellent english, in particular one reception worker named volkan, who was very helpful and always willing to help. location: the hotel faces a whole line of minimarts, a bakery, a money exchange and several takeaway restaurants which are practically open all night. The money exchange closes at midnight, however 2-3 of the minimarts also exchange pounds and euros which is very handy. There is a shisha cafe literally 2 doors to the left of the hotel and the metro is less than a 2 min walk with a starbucks opposite. The street that the hotel is on is very lively even at 5am and feels very safe as it is often used as a police checkpoint (which can get a little noisy at night) and there are always a lot of people around. Expect to pay between 50 and 55 tlr for a taxi to/ from ataturk airport to the hotel and a maximum of 25 tlr to the blue mosque. In all, we really enjoyed our stay at the alkoclar keban hotel and especially loved the amazing location of this hotel and will defintely be recommending this hotel to friends and family and hope to return soon.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cAn Excellent choice for a group of friends\u201d", "Author": "Allam_Abeer", "ReviewID": "UR122443733", "Content": "We were a group of friends , four , and we stayed in a family room.

Despite its perfect location middle of taksim just facing Istiklal street which makes it easy to go out at night; the hotel is disgustingly small with stuffy-smelled furniture both in reception, restaurant & rooms. The check-in was fine; then came the invetion of elevators, one of the present two almost occupies only two guests sticking to each other no space for bags. The rooms were not very small but very stuffy & dark, beds were not clean & had an odour. The bathroom, basin & toilet were manageable but the bath tub!!!

In bed, second & third night something has bitten my ankle, not sure if it ant, mosquito or what but it was very itchy. The Restaurant is under the ground!!! Again stuffy & poorly furnished, staff are busy chatting to each other. Good food variety but not tasty quality. The worse that happened is that on the third day while returning in the evening from shopping heading to our room, the electronic key didn't open our room we tried several times with no luck; my friend & I descended to the reception to ask for assitance. The rep in the reception told us that the housekeeping has collected our stuff from the bathroom & room into one of our bags & moved the stuff into another room on the 1st floor!!!!!!!
