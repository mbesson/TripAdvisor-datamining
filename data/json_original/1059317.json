{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A very basic hotel This hotel is not near the airport by road - it is approximately 20 minutes away. The pickup service from the airport picks up from the departure floor, which is very confusing. The service cannot be pre-ordered, but once you arrive at the airport, phone the hotel, and wait 15 minutes for the car to arrive.The non-smoking room smelled very strongly of cigarettes, particularly the bedding. The bed was very hard, and there was only one pillow provided for each of us. The bathroom was small and very basic - no luxuries here! The shower had a shower curtain, which I haven't seen in a hotel for a long time.The lighting in the room was so bad that we used a torch to pack our things when we left.The breakfast was generous, but had been mostly prepared the evening before, the juice was lukewarm and the bread stale.On a positive note, the receptionists we dealt with were very friendly and helpful.We chose this hotel because it was an 'airport' hotel, and were very disappointed in the position and the facilities. Certainly not worth the price we paid.", "Date": "Dec 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR317032826", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Tasmania16"}, {"Content": "A Great Hotel Close to Frankfurt Airport We stayed at this hotel for one night prior to leaving Germany for the US. So, like probably most people that stay here, we selected it because of its proximity to the Frankfurt Airport.The hotel is located in a suburb south of the airport. It is not too easy to find but actually we had little problems with a google map printed out.1. Location: If you need a hotel prior to a flight out of Frankfurt, this hotel is a great choice. They have a free transfer (by taxi) to the airport, right on time when we needed it.2. Staff: Very professional, helpful and friendly.3. Bedoom/bathroom: Very nice size bedroom with sitting area and a nice size bathroom. Both rooms were immaculately clean. We did not use the TV or anything else offered in the room as we arrived late and left early.4. Breakfast: Very good and generous breakfast bar. Open very early for everyone who has to leave early (like at 7 AM).5. They do not have a restaurant in the hotel but there are several places within easy walking distance. We walked to a German restaurant (about 10 minutes) called Gundhof which I highly recommend as the food was very plentiful and good and service was excellent.6. The only small complaint I have was the we never got the wake-up call we had requested because their system was down. Fortunately I ALWAYS set my travel clock as a backup so we did not oversleep.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR394612777", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "augustleo1"}, {"Content": "Hotel molto distante da...   showReview(21662709, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR355298388", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d1059317-r22509117-Airport_Domizil_Hotel_Frankfurt-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "1059317", "Price": "$186"}}
