The breakfast is excellent with the full range of hot and cold food and coffee service at your table. The reception staff and concierge were very helpful and couldn't be faulted. We didn't use the spa or pool so can't comment. My only niggles were that the room was very warm at night and the air conditioning didn't seem to help - and was actually a bit noisy.

Overall this was an excellent hotel and we can recommend it to anyone that would like a good stay. A few things to notice though: The spa-area is very nice with a large pool and 2 different saunas. As other reviewers have mentioned the sauna area is mixed, i.e. both men and women enjoy the same saunas. However the information about that and rules for \"engagement\" could be clearer. We had read the reviews prior to our visit and knew to expect naked people of both genders, and as flexible travellers we followed the example of the first gentleman we met in the area and undressed completely. Clearly not everyone had understood the principle which had the consequence that when my girlfriend and I went into the steam sauna we found ourselves in the company of a mother and daughter wearing swimsuits. Lucky enough we had large towels with us so that we could avoid making the other couple more unconfortable. Several other couples did join the sauna and there was a clear confusion regarding the (un-)Dress code. My advice to the hotel management would be to put up larger signs, preferably with pictures, that clearly shows what is expected to wear, and not, in the area. This a side, the sauna was very nice. If you like a spa-treatment then make sure to book it as early as possible in order to get it at a time that is convinient for you - during x-mas, at least, it wasn't too easy to find a suitable slot. Speaking about booking, if you book your stay at the hotel early then you can get a very good discount! My advice is to use this discount, or part of it, to upgrade to a room with free mini-bar, WiFi, and breakfast - it's well worth the few extra Euros, and would be much more expensive if it's bought at the location. We can also recommend the fantastic restaurant at the hotel, excellent service and very very nice menu. Last, but not least, we were unfortunately recommended a poor restaurant for our dinner night out in Berlin, we are absolutely convinced that this was an accident driven by the fact that most restaurants weren't open during x-mas eve, but a good practise would always be to double-check any recommendations on trip-advisor! If we would have done this, then we wouldn't have visited Restaurante Diverso!!!!

My wife and I booked in for three nights over the second weekend in December and throughly enjoyed our stay. ROOM: We were given a deluxe room on our check in on the second floor. Overall, it was excellent - extremely clean, bright with modern furnishings. The mini-bar was included in the room price which was a nice touch and while we also had Wi-Fi included. However we did not really need it as there is an excellent business room outside the lift on each floor. One slight negative on the room front was that the lack of English TV stations. LOCATION: The hotel is situated in the West side of the city, close to the 'K'dam' which is one the main shopping areas on Berlin (5 mins walk). Zoo station is also approx a 10 min walk from the hotel which made it convenient from Schonefeld Airport - we caught an Airport Express train which took approx 35 minutes. FOOD: Breakfast was excellent. There was a great choice available at the buffet, from cereals, breads, hot buffet, made to order eggs/omelettes and crepes,cold meats, fruit and pastries. It was one of the highest standard selections that we had experienced in a hotel. The food was constantly stocked and the staff were very quick to provide tea/coffee and refills.The weekend was busy but the room was a good size to cope. SPA: After a short walk to a different wing in the hotel (transfer through 2nd Floor) you can reach the hotel spa which includes a large pool, ideal for lengths. There is also a 'mixed' sauna & steam room area which leads from both changing areas which was an oasis of relaxation. STAFF: We found all the staff were extremely helpful.

I think it was a Sofitel back then but is now still the same group but re- branded as a Pullman. It looks imposing and comfortable and being near the zoo was a little more centralled placed than my last hotel if you want to walk out to both the former East and West Berlin. The deal in the deluxe room with complimentary wifi and minibar was well worth it. The wifi is fine and the mini bar stocked with chocolates,crisps and a selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. Given the status of the hotel cleanliness and comfort is a given but I cannot remember stopping in a hotel where all surfaces and glasswear gleamed,lots of chrome and glass and no smears or finger marks anywhere - real attention to detail. The room was kept clean to a similar impeccable standard. The buffet breakfast was excellent,and is open 6:30 to 11 from recollection so it is never too crowded. The spa is beautifully decorated and really relaxing and a decent sized swimming pool. I know this all really repeats what is in the preceding reviews but it is exactly what you get ayt this hotel - I noticed Lufthansa book their pilots in here so I'm sure that speaks volumes. However it is the staff who make the whole experience even better. From checking in - quick,courteous and efficient, to the breakfast staff - friendly and welcoming and the cheerful spa staff you really were made to feel like a special guest - particularly nice when on holiday. Again the check out service was crisply efficient ( they had clearly put extra staff on at an anticipated busy time ) but also personal and friendly. As the title implies it is difficult to say anything negative about this gem of a hotel but if pushed possible improvements would be : 1.

We were staying in a suite and it was very clean and big and very well layed out. We were very impressed with the size of the bed and how comfortabe the bed and pillows were. Our windows overlooked the zoo and the children had great fun looking out. We were also very impressed by the extra effort the hotel went to with the extra little touches like a gift for the children which containded colouring books and crayons. The free mini bar was also a nice touch with water, orange juice, wine, beer ect and also nuts and other snacks. When our bags arrive they were brought straight to the room with no fuss. We also used the free internet which was very fast and efficient. We had room service on two nights as the children were to tired to go out and on both nights we were very impressed by the standerds of the food and the service. Everything was presented on a lovely well layed out trolly. With everything we needed. We had pasta for the children and there was parmesan cheese and we had homemade hambergers and there was plenty of salad dressing and sauses. All in all it was so relaxing and just what you wanted for a family trip with no fuss and for the kids to feel happy and well fed. We also used the swimming pool a few times the only criticism was that the temperature of the pool was very very cold and it was hard to enjoy it as we and the children found it to cold to stay in it to long. We had breakfast every morning of our stay and found it to be a very pleasureable experience. There was a huge choice of food on offer from cooked to cold selection with plenty of cold meats and cheeses and pate. There were lots of different breads and little pastries. I found the selection of teas most enjoyable and we always found that the breakfast set us up for the day to go sight seeking. My only criticism was that the self service area was a bit small and could get very crowed when it got busy and sometimes the staff hovered around the tables a bit to much as they needed to turn the tables over quickly as the demand for tables was huge so you felt a bit rushed if it was busy.

The bad: There is no Wi-Fi in the hotel, not even for a charge. How a hotel, especially of Pullman's quality, doesn't have Wi-Fi in 2011 is beyond me.

We got an upgrade from a Classic to a Deluxe room, paid a very reasonable price, incl. breakfast wireless (free, also a nice add on) and found ourselves in a nice, luxurious and relatively spacious room facing the inner courtyard of the hotel on the 9th floor. Very clean, quiet room, nice bathroom, comfortable beds and feather pillows (or, as a choice special \"health\" pillows), with a Nespresso coffee machine, two duvets (pity that no German hotel seems to provide a nice double duvet rather than two smaller duvets which cannot be tugged tightly at feet end). A centrally located spot for this Accor hotel at Budapester Strasse, not far from the main Berlin attractions. Very extensive and wonderful breakfast in an overall very tastefully designed hotel (even the corridors, not always the most attractive parts of any hotel, are tastefully designed). The reception and concierge are kind and helpful. The hotel has a nice and rather larghe swimming pool and attractive Spa. In summary: simply the best. Want to hear two things that they could improve? Make turn down service a standard service, or, alternatively, ask a guest when checked in, whether they like this service (we do). Obviously this is not standard practice you have to ask for it and big chance if you say \"turn down service\" the receptionist will not immediately understand what you mean. Last small point where the hotel could improve: assistance with luggage. When we checked out and came to collect our luggage after a bike tour (yes the hotel rents good bikes, a must do in Berlin!) we had to struggle with rather voluminous luggage to the front door, no door men assisting us.

Make sure your insurance will cover this. The hotel is very well situated, out of the hotel and turn left you will head towards the local township where there are plenty of bars and restaurantes within 10 min walk. There is also a bank just 2 min down the same road if you need cash. Turning left you can pick up the local tourist bus company city hopper. This is really worthwhile so for a small sum you can hop on and off the bus as it takes you to the main attactions of Berlin. Turning right out of the hotel you will come across a greak restaurante just 2 min down the road, this is an excellent place for drinks or a meal on an evening. Just past the restaurante, next to the river right you can pick up boat that takes you round the city for a small euro sum, the trip takes about 2.5 hours but really is fantastic with drinks served on-board - really cool on a nice warm day. Turning left rather than right you follow a wooded path behind the Berlin Zoo complex. This is really cool as you see the animals etc from the riverside viewing inwards (its really a free show), load of birds, animals etc to look at. Brilliant. There is also a river-boat lock nearby with a small bar so you sit and watch the boats passing through the lock. The hotel is fantastic. Really good value for money. Breakfast is served over 3 rooms and caters for anything from 1 to 10 guests on a table. It's really cool to sit outside as we did on our first night with really warm weather, just drinking into the small hours and taking in the street views. Breakfast is a feast, just fill your boots. If you are into a Gym/Swim/Sauna cuture I have a few pieces of advice for you here - this hotel has the largest swimming pool in the area with a host of sauna and steam rooms to tempt you. So OK lets get down to the nitty gritty - first if are going to the gym no problem, go for it. If after your gym session or your swim session you decide to go for a sauna then be aware...both the men's and ladie's changing room may say \"change/sauna this way\" buty what they really mean is they converge into a massive steam room from which men and women both emerge. In Germany it is NOT the done thing to have anything on when you go sauna, so my advice from this experience is to grab anothe towel from the shef that will be in threre and use it as you 'carpet'. Enter the area, hang up one towel and use the othe to carpet your lay-down spot. From the moment you hang up your towel, you shoud be naked from then on in. The men's changing area and women's changing area converge in this communal area. The area has rooms off with different temperature sauna etc. The communal area also has 'fun showers' where you can shower with forceful showers and have coloured lights flashing etc. This whole area is male/female naked only. Now do not be put off.... ....On entry to the communal area you will see several nakes bodies, men/women, just standing, talking etc - this is normal, just enter any sauna/steam room you want then come out say 10 min later. Dont be afraid you will be showering next to someone from the opposite sex and perhaps going into a splash-pool with them naked in a few minutes time, this is all part of the experience. If you are a guy at this hotel, dont worry about female attendents in your changing room. They will quite often start to clean the floor while you are in the shower, you can have nice chat to them while you try to scrub up. Dont be timid, just act natural and think matcho!!! They will often come into the sauna to add water to the coals for you, just dont worry about it. Overall remember Germans are very private people apart from in their Sauna/Bath-houses where they are very 'free' with their bodies. Just go along with it and you will have a great time!!! ...", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gothenburg, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cExcellent room\u201d", "Author": "NilsW", "ReviewID": "UR117357227", "Content": "Located very close to Kurfurstendamm, good room, excellent breadfeast.

Our room was on the seventh floor overlooking the courtyard and was very modern, plenty of room and with all the facilities expected of this class of hotel. A nice bathroom with a bath and shower over bath (take care getting into the shower though) and spotlessly clean. A separate check was made by hotel staff daily to ensure the room was cleaned properly. Expensive mini bar (of course) and tea/coffee making facilities also in the room (a nice surprise) and two bottles of water were provided free of charge. Free WiFi or internet connection was available in the room, but not for free. Actually, the cost was quite expensive, which is disappointing and obviously catering to business people (with company paid expenses) rather than leisure travelers. There is a nice restaurant at the hotel, which was expensive compared to local restaurants. A full buffet breakfast (eggs, crepes etc prepared on request) was included with our room rate and was excellent. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge's desk where you can purchase train tickets and also theater tickets if you are interested. To get around Berlin, the No 200 bus goes down Budapester Str., or you can get the train from the nearest metro (U Bahn) which is Wittenbergplatzl or Zoologischer Garten, both about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Tip for sightseeing; take the No 100 Bus (outside of Zoologischer Garten station) for Euro 2.30 (tickets available from Hotel Concierge) as this bus travels the same routes as the sightseeing buses (but no audio available of course).

Reception v welcoming and we asked for and were given a view of the Zoo on the 6th floor (don't worry the lifts are quick and pleasant). This overlooks the quiet tree lined street that the hotel is located off but just by the main shopping areas and transport links - this is a bonus, as it is away from the really busy main streets where other big hotels are located. The view is incredible. Our room was immaculately clean, spacious and welcoming as were the corridors and seated viewing areas. Daily housekeeping with complimentary water, tea and coffee replenished, a bonus after a long day of sightseeing. Roger Gallet complimentary toiletries. The pool and spa areas are wonderful and as a guest you have free use of the facilities. We ensured we paid a bit extra to have the breakfast buffet included and I do recommend you to do that - the choice is huge and the quality is amazing - you just have to experience it to believe it. We were so full, we never needed to buy lunch and only felt like tea and cake mid afternoon. Ask for the adjoining room at the back of the dining area and you will feel you are in a private, exclusive salon. The decor is beautiful. What we also loved about this hotel is the staff - unfallingly polite, helpful and kind - they really do want to make your stay the best posible - absolutely nothing is too much trouble. The Concierge is amazing and you can do most things there like buying your transport tickets, making reservations or booking the Reichstag visit or a river trip. It makes it all so easy. Their recommendation for a nearby Italian was spot on - lovely food, service and atmosphere - the Via Condotti.. Overall, this hotel exceeded our expectations and we will be back as soon as possible - we aren't alone in our opinion, as we noticed that lots of different airline pilots were checking in as well and they usually know a thing or two.

The Kurfuerstendamm lies in walking distance. With the Bus 200 you can also head directly to various points of interest (e.g. Potsdamer Platz, Friedrichstra\u00dfe, Alexanderplatz, etc.) * Arrival We were greeted warmly and were already pre-upgraded to a superior room. I requested an additional suite upgrade, which was denied, instead I received an upgrade to a deluxe room, which was few square meters larger than th superior room. It also had a Nespresso coffee machine and we got the minibar for free, which was great. * Room The room was nice, quiet and spacious. Everything was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The Nespresso machine was definitely an upside, as the coffee tastes great. * Bar We got a voucher for a free drink in the bar, which we used on the first evening. The bar is not exceptional in any way, but the staff was very nice and the pricing is definitely below the standard, that one expects from hotel bars in a capital city.

We had a very good (and cheap) breakfast in a small bakery right around the corner on Kurfuerstenstrasse right next to an Europcar car rent station, which I can definitely recommend. * Spa From all the pictures that we saw, the Spa looks great, but we didn't have the time to visit it.

If you like modern hotels with stylish minimalistic interior, you will enjoy staying in Schweizerhof. I have stayed there for a single night, so I didn't have a chance of experiencing much more than my room and the breakfast restaurant. My Classic Room on 7th floor, average size, was overlooking Berlin ZOO. I imagine the view at any time of year other than winter is stunning - no tigers or lions spotted this time. The cleaning standard is average, with several hairs spotted in the bathroom upon arrival, the rest of the room was although acceptable. I have little to complain about, when it comes to the amenities. An ironing board would have been great, and not having such in what I would categorize as a business hotel surprises me a bit. What annoyed me was the strangely functioning air conditioning. It isn't possible to set a desired temperature as one would normally do. You can only adjust a preset temperature with 3 steps up and down. This wasn't quite enough for me, as I prefer sleeping in a chilled room. Thankfully the window could be opened, allowing cold and fresh air do the job. Additionally, do yourself a favour and save the 24\u20ac which is the cost of the breakfast. You can easily grab something in a caf\u00e9 for a fraction of the price, as eating out in Berlin is very cheap.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ericliv Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR91925057", "Content": "Lovely hotel, great location.

There is also an fitness room overlooking the pool. Our room was near the pool on a part of the hotel which is extremely quiet. Our room was elegantly spare, really comfortable with great beds and club chairs with ottomans. My only complaint is the sheets were stiff and starchy, harsh really on the skin. I plan to let the hotel know of that. We had very good service from the check-in staff, and okay conceirge help. Some were better than others. This hotel does a lot of convention and event business so it does make an independent traveler feel a little lost in the lobby - but we would recommend it for its other assets: great location on main bus line, very close to the Zoo train station, the Kurfustendam shopping area, etc. We did not eat at the property - the restaurant menu was rather odd - and breakfast is expensive for people who just want coffee, cocoa and bread. Around the corner is a French cafe which has excellent breakfasts at much less cost.

I found out just on my way to bed and did not bother calling for someone to come repair it at 11 p.m. - but was anoying in the morning. I am sure that if I had called they would have sent someone immediately. The bath room didn't really live up to the rest of the hotel or room... should have been done more exclusively. 2) WLAN is incredibly expensive - I had to pay \u20ac25 for a 24 hour acces - and not that great bandwithd. Radisson hotels provides WLAN for free - something every business hotel should do. Paying that much money is robbery... Breakfast buffet was plentyful and good. Cooks are standing by to cook fresh omelets or different variations of scrambled eggs at your desire. Other than that there is everything you would want on a breakfast buffet.

The hotel did not seem busy and the staff were attentive, well presented and pleasant with very good English. The location of the hotel is situated excellently considering the size of the city where everything is not together \u2013 IE \u2013 the city is very large with no real centre and thus spread out; So one needs to be on a bus route! This hotel is on a great bus route if not the best bus line and the 200 route goes outside the hotel and basically links west Berlin where the hotel is situated to east Berlin (old town). In fact the no. 200 bus goes the same way as the tour bus (in part). They also go every 10 mins and cost 2.50euro EW. They are safe and clean. The concierge in the hotel can organise tickets which you have to validate on the bus (although we did not realise this and effectively used it again the second nite). The location is opposite the Berlin Zoo and the beginning of the shopping area - Kurf\u00fcrstendamm . There is a great department store \u2013 \u201cKaDeWe\u201d where they serve excellent food in various small boutique restaurants on the top floor whilst providing all the usual top international designers brands on the other 6 floor and refined palates will find it hard to choose from the some 33,000 delicacies from all corners of the world. Other good locations for Lunch would be the inspiring Italian Chain (german owned) called Vapiano which are located off the Ku-damn or around the corner from the Ritz Carlton which is located in the area between this hotel and the old town (east berlin) in an area know as Potsdamer Platz. However, back to the Pullman Berlin Schweizerhof which is the subject of this review. Now, the best thing about this hotel is the Leisure Centre with Spa facilities including showers and thermal treatments all of which are free. There is a full menu of massage and treatments which appear very reasonably priced. The pool is effectively the highlight of the hotel as its a great size with a luxury setting transposed with mood lighting and relaxing seating circumventing the pool. Assistance around the pool again like the lobby is excellent and professional which is courtesy of Mr. Butlins who was our leisure assistant for most of the evenings that we visited him. There is a discreet lift down to the pool area from the room which is excellent as it allows for one to use the complimentary robe and slippers from the room. The rooms themselves are well equipped (flat screen TV with in house movies and satellite channels), Internet access and minibar safe) and laid out. The only fault (if sharing) they are a little on the small side but the corridor area will always make up for this. The air conditioning is a little poor but might have been to do with the fact that we couldn't work it or two large lads in one rooms. There is a small little bar in the lobby that is smart and good place to end the nite after being to the Matrix or one of the other great nite spots in Berlin. There is a restaurant in the hotel which looks good but I cant comment on it, as we did not eat there - nothing to do with the hotel but merely because it better to go out and about. We went to the old town (Alexander Platz / TV tower area or overall the Mite area) in an area called the Nikolai quarter . This is the very core of old Berlin or, strictly speaking, of the eastern half of C\u00f6lln-Berlin, on the site of the oldest known settlement on a ford around the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas' Church). The Nikolaiviertel as its locally known as presents a stark contrast to the open spaces on its northern side between the Palace of the Republic and the Television Tower and contains great little restaurants, coffee shops and bars. However, its not the \u201ctemple bar\u201d area in Dublin but starkly different with an emphasis more on romantics\u2019 given its location along the River Spree. There is a fantastic French restaurant facing the river spree between a bar called Brauhaus Georgebrou and the next bridge up toward Ephraims coffee shop(about 50m) I would recommend the French onion soup and fantastic meat dishes with great collection of good French reds. So to sum up, a great city with some great sights with no better base to explore from than the Pullman Berlin Schweizerhof. Enjoy or as they say in Berlin - Hab Spa\u00df!

The Hotel: not on a overally busy street. Very modern look to it...nicely decorated...impressive actually, front desk staff very nice...the rooms are a bit smallish, but not bad...very clean and modern looking...flat screen TV that you can program for english...it has a speaker in the bathroom as well...our room had no bureau!, but my brother's room did...he was a single, and we were two people with a lot of clothes, and one small closet for them, and a couple of shelf areas...I loved the tea/coffee drawer...HINT: you must pull the drawer all the way out, for the teapot to turn on...electric kettle...was a nice touch...there is a mini bar, but it was way over-priced...we simply removed some items, but put our own wine, milk and snacks in it, and no one ever said anything to us...the bathroom was roomy, however the blowdryer was terrible, bring your own/with adapter...There was a charge for internet use, seemed high, so we didn't use it, but the room had a desk that was equipped for it. The shower was great, always hot water, weird shower door, but it worked. They give you slippers/bathrobe, which we discovered is what they want you to use in the wellness area...we used the bathrobe, and our flip flops... Maid Service: outstanding...we tipped the maid third day we were there, as she did a great job..I left her messages in German for extra sugar, tea bags, and was always accomodated...the linens were very crisp and clean...the beds were fine...the pillows are okay, kind of mushy...I must mention the light situation, as no one at desk mentioned how to keep lights on, I just knew from reading it on trip advisor's forum from Mexico...you must keep one of your room keys in the slot by the door at all times while in the room to keep the lights on...very quiet room...never heard a peep in hallway etc...as others have mentioned, the rooms get too warm...and we were there end of Feb/beginning of March...we needed the A/C on, and the thermostat in the room only went just so far..we needed to keep window opened but it was kind of damp and nasty weather a few nights, so that wasn't good...we told front desk and they said they would adjust it, didn't seem to make too much difference, so when we left, we would leave both windows open to let some air in...also the beds don't have sheets..there is a bottom sheet but no sheet to cover you, you are supposed to use the feather bed to cover you, but it was so stuffy in room that this was way too hot, so we would remove the feather bed from the cover, and use the cover as a sheet...these were just some things we had to get used to, I haven't been to europe in a long time, and I guess I'm \"americanized\" so it was an adjustment...but I really liked the room, and just loved the tea kettle set up...overall impression of room/hallways/hotel is really nice pretty modern looking hotel...great little bar area...the happy hour is from 9PM to 10PM, and you can get some good prices on cosmos there, which were very good...we did not eat at the hotel, it seemed pretty pricey...breakfast was inclulded with our rate, and it was the best breakfast I've ever been to in any hotel...they had everything you could think of...including a station that made crepes, omelettes etc...a nice juice set up...and the rolls were to die for...best rolls I've ever had...if you can get that included in your rate, what a bargain, as its pretty expensive to pay for separate... The subway: very user friendly system, color coded, maps are avail at the little stores inside the stations, they have the ones with the larger print...easy to read, easy to use, no problems, and pretty clean...we purchased a pass for the week, and it included unlimited subway, train, bus use...which worked for us, as my brother's apt was outside Berlin city... Wellness Centre: Very nicely done..beautiful indoor pool, supposedly 82 F, but I will tell you when you first dip in, it seems kind of cold...you adjust pretty quickly, but I would like to have seen it much warmer..there is no hot tub so that could be disappointing for some...there is a great steam room, best I've ever used..it has a eucylptus infusion in it, which when first entered it is overpowering, but give it a chance, it was fantastic..my brother/sister had colds, and they said it was great for clearing their system...there are two rain showers then to wash off in, which were nice and toasty...we saw the ice, wasn't interested in it...and the foot spas, we didn't use those either...now if you go directly into pool after steam room, you will freeze going into that pool water...you will get used to it, but I really think they should up the temperature...we asked, and were told they couldn't...but nonetheless, the pool is pretty, and once you adjust to the temp, its quite nice to float, or swim in...the loungers at the pool were the most comfortable loungers ever, we fell asleep on them...its a very relaxing area...there is a cool upstairs area as well where you can read...and access an outdoor deck that was pretty, no chairs, but it was winter...The wellness area is so pretty and relaxing that the pool water really didn't matter too much in the end, as we used it everyday and enjoyed every bit of it... The lobby has a bowl of granny smith apples that you can take...so our overall impression of the hotel was I would stay there again, now that I am aware of the phone thing...which was really a headache for the first few days...our cells did not work, and the only way to reasonably call the US for us, was to walk to a \"phone store\" and use the phones in there, that was cheap...we bought a phone card, and at the end of our stay the hotel charged us 3.50 euro each time we used it from the room...I wish the hotel had told us that beforehand, as I asked them about the phone store to begin with.. that was a shocker to the tune of roughly 350.00 US dollars tacked onto our bill...we are trying to talk to hotel about that now, if they credit us some of that back then my rating would go up to 5 stars...I think that is way overpriced to charge tourists...Overall great modern pretty hotel, great area...fantastic wellness area....great stay...", "Date": "March 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "AHotelier", "ReviewID": "UR26294263", "Content": "I stayed at the Pullman Berlin for business.

Nothing real special though.\u201d", "Author": "tequilatamm", "ReviewID": "UR20256028", "Content": "We stayed at the Sofitel Berlin Schweizerhof in September... in fact, we check out tomorrow! We are in room 706 which is a room facing the courtyard. We gathered from reviews of the hotel that the courtyard view was prettier and more quiet. It's not particularly pretty, as it faces on to another office building with a few trees in between, but it is perhaps more quiet than facing the street side. My first impression of the Schweizerhof is that it didn't look as nice in person as it did in the photos... it looks much more like one of Accor's lesser chains, such as a Novotel, however the feel is a bit more elegant. There were several conferences going on over the weekend that we have been here, and at nearly all times of day, the lobby was crowded with people and receptions. I gather from the number of breakfasts and lunches, etc., that were setup in the lobby itself, they don't have much space in other areas to accommodate such things. This was a little bit annoying, as you had to weave through the crowds to get to and from the elevator when going/coming. However, it also gave the hotel a festive feel, so maybe in some ways it was good. One of our big complaints was with the climate control in the room. The room would get really stuffy in the early morning and stay that way until we returned in the evening, when the winter weather had cooled things off. When we enquired, we were told that, \"Oh, you don't need air conditioning in the winter, so we've turned it off.\" However, the windows only open a slight bit, not enough to cool off the room, so after some insistence by us, reception contacted maintenance who supposedly came up to the room while we were out for the day and turned the air conditioning back on in our room. This seemed to work as the room felt cooler when we got back for the day, but once again, around 4 or 5am, it got really stuffy. For the third night of our stay, we asked to sign the obligatory waiver that we would not hold the hotel responsible if we jumped out the windows, were they to unlock them for us. They promptly, after that, sent someone up with a key to unlock the windows so we could open them all the way. The temperature is much cooler this evening, and will definitely make for nicer sleeping. I am now very happy we have the courtyard side, as sleeping with windows open on the street side would indeed be noisy! So anyway, climate control was a problem, however, the hotel was rather prompt at dealing with all our requests. The pillows were also a disappointment... nearly... nonexistent feeling. Our heads sink in to them and disappear into the matress. Tonight, we have requested a third pillow each, which was promptly delivered, and this will hopefully help the situation. A small complaint, but better pillows that aren't so hollow feeling would be nice too. Now for some of the good things. The hotel has what looks like a whole new \"wellness\" area, accessed from an internal lift well, so that you don't have to take the general elevator to get to it. The pool is large and although not as warm as we would have liked it to be, warm enough to swim in or take a dip after a long day out shopping and sightseeing. The pool is open until 10pm, which gives one time to go to it after a day out, which is also nice. It is manned by one staff in the evenings who always greets you nicely and offers towels, lockers, anything else you might want. There were nice lounges, and a bar that looked to serve fruit drinks and coffee/espresso, although not that time of the evening. There was an upstairs area called a \"relax\" area, which appeared to have a sundeck off of it, although we also didn't use this. The gym looked very nice, with all the normal equipment, but very modern. A few of each type of machine. Had we not walked so much I would have gladly made use of this. There are mens and womens locker rooms, and off of these, there is another common area which contains some pretty neat stuff. There was no jacuzzi, but there were both a wet steam room and a sauna. I love wet heat, and the steam room was one of the best I've ever been in... nice configuration, and lots of steam, with water hoses to make more steam when needed. In addition, in this area, there were two shower wells. One had no less than 7 shower outlets... some coming at all levels off the wall, plus an overhead rose. Next to it was an overhead \"rainforest\" shower, with glowing lights. Very nice. In addition to all this, there was an icemaker area in the wall which generated \"snow\" style ice, so you could cool yourself down after heating yourself up by using the \"snow\". But perhaps best of all was the \"foot bath\" area. A heated, tiled seat area, which had two foot basins at it. Put the funny looking plug in, fill up with water and let run. When the water gets to the top of the plug, it keeps draining at that level, so you can have a continuous flow of hot water on your feet, to soak in. FANTASTIC after walking around Berlin all day! I smuggled my camera in and took photos, so see the traveler photos attached for pictures of all this. Another thing I really liked about the room was the heated towel rail in the bathroom. We needed to do some hand wash, and this rail served a great purpose in drying our clothes very quickly! The shower head on the other hand didn't have the strongest stream of water ever and I had to take long showers to get all the soap out! We had breakfast included in our rate, and were pleasantly surprised at the freshness and tastiness of it. All of the \"European\" style breakfast items were quite fresh and nice tasting: Cold cuts, bread, cream cheese, cheese, etc. There were also hot dishes such as scrambled eggs, potatoes, a few kinds of sausages, etc. There was also a rather large selection of yoghurts and fruits which, if this is your thing, would have given you great choice of flavours! There was a cook who was ready to make you omelettes or crepes as you liked, and there were also thin waffles that had been previously made laid out for the taking. In addition, lots of breads and juices. All in all, not the most astounding breakfast I'd ever had at a hotel, but certainly right up there with the good ones. As far as location of the hotel, Berlin is a strange city, very spread out. The hotel is next to the zoo, about a 10 minute walk from Zoo Station where you can take the U & S trains, and not too much further to Kurfurstendamm, one of the big shopping areas. If these are what you want to be near, then the location is good, although there are similar hotels even nearer. If I had it to do over again, I might consider something like the Radisson, which is near museum island, but that's just me. I certainly wouldn't rule out this hotel, as it was a nice, solid stay, had friendly staff and all the amenities.", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haslemere, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "sandysviews", "ReviewID": "UR20108025", "Content": "We stayed at the sofitel for two days on a jolly to Berlin. One thing we discovered very quickly that in Berlin the hotel you choose is all about location, there are some places which may have great reviews for the hotel but the location could be right oppposite a building site or miles from the nearest bars and restaurants, or just in the wrong part of town. Berlin has an awful lot of construction going on so choose carefully. This place is in a pretty excellent location really, right opposite the Zoo, specify a courtyard facing room if you want quiet, there is quite a busy road going past the front of the hotel, Across the busy road is the Zoo, you really want a room at the back of the hotel rather than at the front. The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the famous bombed out church and the start of the K'dam, also 5 minutes walk is Ka De We which is the 2nd the biggest department store in Europe after Harrods. East Berlin centre is about 15 mins by taxi (there is a rank at the front of the hotel) The hotel itself is comfortable and well equipped with a very good range of spa treatments, the room we had was quite large and the only complaint we have is that the bath towels are very small, The goodies in the bathroom are very high quaility. The bar is quite small but serves everything you need at usual hotel prices. We didnt try the restaurant as we prefer to eat out but it seemed quite nice and very popular. The staff are efficient and very polite and helpful. All in all a perfectly good nice hotel in a very good location which as I said before is everything in Berlin. Top tip: if you fly in and out of Tegel airport dont go through the security and departures gates until you are ready to fly as there is Nothing on the other side of security, just gates and seats. small duty free in a cabin, I would definately stay at the sofitel again rather than risk a hotel in the wrong place which would seriously dent your enjoyment of a short stay", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cA Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "treeman", "ReviewID": "UR17424120", "Content": "I stayed at the Sofitel in Berlin on a business trip with my children.

What really stuck out though was the service at the hotel. We arrived at 9am and were immediately given a room. Obviously, this was only possible because the hotel was not fully booked, but we were still impressed. Also, my friend got sick during our stay and everyone was really helpful, bringing up chicken noodle soup, even though that was not on the room service menu, and their laundry service was also extremely prompt, washing and returning trousers the same evening. Staff at the front desk and the concierge were also helpful. They sell day tickets for public transport right there, which is very convenient. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel that takes you to Potsdamer Platz in about 15 minutes. Though the hotel is in a quiet street, it is only two blocks to the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (the main shopping street), which is very convenient, and the underground station is about a 10 minute walk away. In conclusion, this is a very nice hotel that you can often get a very good deal on in a safe neighbourhood.

Budget hotels were not even this cheap in Berlin. While we were travelling, I emailed the hotel to ask for an additional night at that same rate and they happily obliged us, which really impressed me. The hotel is new and very well designed. It is a very modern style, but this is Berlin and a lot of things are modern. The rooms weren't huge, but very comfortable, with good beds, a cabinet with glasses in them, a mini-bar, safe and nice toiletries in the bathroom. The king sized bed we had was two twin beds pushed together, but this was good. We found that on our trip, a lot of hotels didn't even do that. The pool was also very nice, but unlike a lot of hotels I've been to, a lot of people use it, so it's hard to get the pool to yourself. I never quite figured out where the women's changing room is - there was a large room that I thought was the women's changing room, but the saunas were off this room and naked men were occassionally strolling by. There's also a small gym. The breakfasts were 21 or 22 euros, but you can go elsewhere on the Ku'damm which is quite close to the hotel. The hotel internet was also very expensive, but there's an Easy Internet Cafe on Ku'damm (above the Dunkin' Donuts) and another one towards the station. This hotel is about a 10 minute walk (even with large backpacks) from the hotel to the Zoo Bahnhoff. This station will also take you to Schoenefeld airport, and the train we arrived on stopped there, so this was a very convenient location. The staff was nice and professional and the concierge was very helpful. He can sell you subway tickets and help you find your way. The one thing that I didn't like and have a hard time getting used to even if it is very common in Europe, is that people smoke in the lobby.
