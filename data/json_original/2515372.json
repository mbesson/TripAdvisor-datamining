Actually I am surprised you made it out without more problems. The Commodore was a flop house. We have seen constant drug deals from the windows of the Commodore with the corner payphone and even furniture and clothing being thrown out the windows. We called the police once because suitcases were being thrown out the window onto cars below. Before the police showed up a woman came down and cut up most of the items with a knife. The Commodore is being demolished next month to make way for more condos.

The shower didnt give me enough water. I mean, only less warm water came from the tap little by little. Most of the things in the room were dirty. The windows didnt open smoothly.

I arrived in seattle and needed a place to sleep for one night while waiting for a friend who lived in the city to arrive. i ended up at the commodore. i should have know something was wrong when i got into the elevator and encountered a hooker who was half-clothed and looked miserable. walking into the room, there was an overwhelming smell that i soon discovered was coming from the bathroom. there was mold and mildew about a foot high from the floor on all of the walls. there were pubic hairs all over the toilet which didn't flush. we had no towels and the front desk said they had none to give us. there were muddy footprints on the bedsheets. i've travelled all over the world and stayed in some seedy places before, but this took the cake. i slept sitting up on a chair in the room. we asked them to hold our bags the next day when we checked out until my friend arrived...they \"lost\" our bags and we were left to search a storage room for them that smelled so badly i had to leave because i was gagging uncontrollably. it's an atrocity this place exists. no one should pay for such terrible conditions. it's made me terrified of hotels.", "Date": "February 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cHorrible Experience - felt unsafe\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1733292", "Content": "Arrived late at about 9:00 pm. Planned to stay here for 4 nights and paid in advance online. Big mistake!! Hotel was dirty and their were lots of trays of dirty dishes left in the hallways near guest rooms. A lurking drug dealer tried to follow us into our room. Didn't feel safe with the lock on the door so we placed our suitcases against the door as an added safety measure. Plaster and paint peeling from the ceiling, furniture was scratched and thrashed and there were cigarette burns and stains all over the carpet. No water glasses and was told that housekeeping wasn't there. The tiniest bathroom was unbelievably too small to even maneuver in with the door closed. I asked for another room and they gave me a key to see a renovated room that was cleaner but missing a toilet. We agreed to stay only one night since it was so late and leave at daybreak.... that's how bad we wanted to get out of there. Loud shouting and shady nightlife on street. Parked my rental car in the lot next door, but didn't feel comfortable about that. At least I could see it from my window in my room. I asked for my money back for remaining nights paid and received a credit to my credit card. When I got back home I contacted the manger to relay my horrible experience and amazingly enough, he refunded my one night's stay by crediting my creditcard. Our worst experience at a hotel ever!!! Do not stay here. Pay the extra $25 and stay at the Best Western.", "Date": "March 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cI've seen worse!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1531273", "Content": "Stayed many times at the Commodore in the late 70's and mid 80's. They've got a locked auto garage across the street, a small but cozy lobby with a TV, and back then they'd just installed new and more secure doors on all the rooms. They cater to working class merchant marines and others, have a laundry and snack bar, and offer both daily and weekly rates. There's quite a difference between the two types of rooms. No frills whatsoever, and in many cases you'll have a sink, but with the bathroom and shower down the hall.One good thing is its location. It's just a block or two from Pike Place Market and the Moore Theater. And, with a large picture window in the lobby you'll get plenty of entertainment watching some of Seattle's strangest characters walk by. If you're on a budget and don't expect anything special, the Commodore is okay by me. A step up, at least it used to be, is the Pacific Plaza on 5th Ave. I believe, if memory serves...", "Date": "December 27, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Maria, CA", "Title": "\u201cNot a good place to stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1136805", "Content": "I stayed at the Commodore back in September. I would have to agree with previous reviews, this is not a good hotel. First off, even the cab driver who drove me and my friends to the hotel asked us why we would stay in that part of the city. The location isn't great, when we booked our room it said we would receive a private bath, which was not true. We had to share our bathroom with a complete stranger, and overall the place was dirty. I wore my flip flops into the shower because I didn't want to take the risk of catching anything.

After that, a stack of library travel books and a journal disappeared from our room - who steals outdated travel books of their own city? The front desk gave us a card with a name of the manager, but whenever we called, he was conveniently not in. They promised us parking - they didn't say that it would be in a lot next door where you had to keep stuffing money into a box at all hours. The neighborhood was not good - many random people yelling at all hours.
