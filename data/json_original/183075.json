I booked on Hotwire and got the room for $85. We have no complaints except that our air/heat system wasn't cooling very well...the temperature in Toronto was 22 degrees that day!! The room temp was comfortable none the less. My daughter and I arrived at 1:00 and were able to check in at that time. The gentleman who checked us in was polite and friendly, and gave my daugter a little welcome gift. We used the pool and hot tub in the afternoon and again later in the evening after my arrived. It was not a large pool, but bright and clean. The hot tub was nice and warm with strong jets. I thought it would be busier since it was march break, but there was never more than 3 or 4 other bathers when we were there. The beds were super comfy, we all had a great nights sleep. My husband did hear some street noise but it didn't keep us awake. We did call housekeeping for extra pillows, and also top sheets for the bed. There is a comfy duvet, but no top sheets...apparantly a \"European\" custom. the bathroom was clean and bright, and the shower had good pressure We did not eat at the hotel...had dinner across the street at the old spaghetti factory...cool decor, pleasant wait staff...the food was ok, reasonably priced. There is a little convenience store beside the hotel that sells basics and also has a counter where you can get sandwiches, and breakfast items. We bought BLT's , muffins , toast and tea etc for less than $20 in the morining. I would stay here again, it is a convenient location ( 10 min walk to Eaton Centre, 10-15 to Rogers Centre) The parking was $23 but we were able to stay parked untill midnight of checkout date at no extra charge.

Plus parking, of course. Good value, we thought, and easily worth three and one-half stars. We were in town to attend an event, so we did not have a chance to eat or drink or work out at the hotel. But the Lobby had a nice ambience and the room itself was very nice. (I didn't sense that we had been given a room near the garbage chute because we booked on Hotwire!) The parking, though the normal outrageous rate (25ish) was easy to get to and easy to return from, and much simpler than nearby pay parking options.

There are lots of neat places to eat nearby, and it is close to one of the big Toronto theatres (sorry,memory fails me). It is also close to Union Station and to the financial district.

Firstly, the hotel room we were checked-into was very bad. It was probably the crappiest room in the hotel. When we checked-in, we asked if we were upgraded because of our membership status and was told that that has been taken care of. However when we got to the room, it was small, old, didn't look clean and definitely wasn't what we've expected. The room definitely wasn't as what was described even as a standard room on the hotel's website. There was no magnifying mirror, no sofa bed, no flat sheet on bed. It looked like a 1* motel room - worse than a private room in a hostel! furniture was cheap, Ikea-like ones. We rang front desk and spoke to another guy. There were rooms we could have been upgraded to but they weren't doing that because we had our lil' dog with us. Well, that wasn't stated on the A-Club membership that you can only get upgraded if there are rooms available and you are without a pet! Walls were also very thin and not sound proof. very noisy. bunch of guests partying in room next to ours for two nights It was super hot in bedroom eventhough the aircond was on 15 degree celcius. I sweat all night and couldn't sleep. Told front desk in the morning before going out. We were advised rudely that nothing can be done. It was because the heating in the entire building was turned on. Was that really true? The corridor was nice and cool. He said he'll speak to engineering but nothing was done. We returned six hours later room was very hot and stuffy. Called front desk and this time the lady sent a maintenance guy up and he felt the heat too and offered us a fan. Fan was much better but was loud and noisy! I had to sleep with my ear plugs on! TV was an old, crappy box! No HD whatsover. In this day and age, do we still use such TVs in a hotel? We also tried to use the printer in the lobby! There was no ink and we got one of the staff member to fix it. All he did was shake the toner and said it'll be fine. Well, it wasn't. We returned to the front desk and spoke to another lady but her answer was she didn't know how to fix it and will get the other guy to do it when he returns. Well, shouldn't the front desk staff know how to fix something so basic? We didn't receive any vouchers for any welcome drinks either like we did in other Accor hotels...Instead, we received a fine for not displaying our parking ticket! Er...we told the hotel at check-in that we had a car and we were charged $23/night for parking! We had to ring the hotel after we got back into the US (because the fine wasn't displayed on the windscreen and somehow flew onto the front as we were driving). We were advised that we had to fax the fine through to them and they'll fix it. Come on! We had to spend $$ on the phone call and fax when they could have easily given us a pass or something to put on our dashboard? Come on! This place was definitely not worth the CAN190/night (approximately). We won't be staying here again and neither would we recommend it to anyone.

No free parking (25 dollars per night), no refrigerator. Actually there is one in your room. However, it was full of beverage cans and snack for sale. They called it \"minibar\".

We had some minor issues but overall a great value in Toronto. We have a family of four and after having a bad experience at another establishment wanted to ensure that the next hotel we chose would be comfortable for a family with small children. Check-in went smoothly. The front desk attendant was not overly friendly but that is a subjective kind of assessment. We did have to change rooms because of an A/C leak in which a section of the carpet became wet. That wasnt that big of a problem. We notified the front desk and we were given another room almost immediately. The rooms were fine for the size- not huge but not tiny. I see that many people complain about the CRT televisions that are present in the standard room, as opposed to a flat panel LCD...you people need to maybe stop watching so much television and step outside of your hotel room once in awhile. Room service although expensive (which is expected) was exceptional. However the attendants sometimes have a hard time comprehending English (???). The pool area was nice and so was the gym. You all need your room card/key to access the hotel elevators and the amenities, which is a nice touch in terms of security. Excellent location if you wish to be downtown. Any place is within walking distance. If you do stay here- DO NOT PARK IN THE HOTEL LOT! The municipal lot on Church St., around the corner, is only $14/day compared to the $25.99/day they will convince you to pay upon check-in. If you have small children they are entitled to a small stuffed animal when you check-in- we had to ask for it (not a big deal). The one and only big negative about Novotel is the mini-bar policy. The minibar has sensors and if you remove any item you will automatically be billed- even if you return it to its original spot! I believe that Novotel needs to revisit this policy because of its complete absurdity.

Front desk check in went fine, I did get stuck with one king bed, rather have 2 full or queen beds and do get them even if I book off hotwire. Most times you get a bit larger room but when she confirm I was checking in alone, said something like its all i need..well what is how she acted it seemed. My room size was OK and the window very small but it opened. The crank handle did nothing but you can just push it open if you unlock it. Nice, had a screen also. Made the room more freshing and the next morning it poured rain for a few hours before clearing up. No rain came inside cause the window was tuck under the roof and it was raining very hard for hours. The A/C was about useless but the temps were cool for the most part, really didn't need it. Thought the room was very clean, Oh yeah, the hotel keeps the flat bed sheet that goes under the cover in the closet..why I don't know. Thanks to another reviewer, I knew right where to find it, so no need to call house keeping. Was easy to do but here I am re making my bed up while on holiday, a first ! The bathroom was OK, not really fancy but pretty nice, If I paid $200 a night I would had been displeased. I noticed later Friday night--say 3am? no hot water, just warm at the most. Hotel was busy and I guess they ran low cause the next morning around 9am the water was very hot. Never noticed it again but then didn't try late Sat night. The TV was the old style tube type, just like I still have at my home, thought it worked just fine. Sure the flat TV's are nicer and I'm sure the hotel will be changing them pretty soon. The bed is more important I feel and that was great. During the rainstorm I mostly stayed in my room till after 2 pm. There is one store near by and its in a cover walk way so I did not even get wet. Got the newspaper and some snacks and went back to relax and watch TV. Had the do not disturb sign on my door. I could hear the maids going around but not one knock, even lightly on my door. Nice, sometimes--many times for me, if the maids around and seen you up earlier that morning they still knock and ask of the can clean the room now when they pass by. . This hotel staff was great, the maids were there but just out of the way. Never really seen them and didn't say a word to them. Left my room finally around 2:30 pm and got back before 5 pm and my room was clean and the maid carts long gone. Might not sound like much but not being disturb is nice when many times for me the maids seem to think no harm in knocking. Left my room key in my room once--almost never do that but I just got back to my room and decided to use the pay phone in the lobby and quickly left my room. Front staff was great, 30 seconds later had a new room key--I did have my ID on me...the clerk didn't seem bother one bit to make up a new key up. The elevators you do need to use your room key to go up, not down. No biggie and that is how I recalled I left my room key, so nice in a way. If you do have a guest over and they don't have a room key, you do have to go down to the lobby and bring them up the elevator to your room, only drawback. Elevators did always work fast, under a min it be there and I was on the 7th floor. On the lobby floor i think the doors open as soon as you pushed the button for it..almost every time. Would stay at the hotel again for the price I paid, even a bit more Did ask how much for one more night, got told they can't match hotwire and June 5th would be $199 plus tax, I checkout instead. I would had stayed another night if it would had been under $140. Hotwire price before fees was $87 US a night, I don't understand hotel pricing, hotwire likely paid around $170 for both nights. Don;t think the hotel was sold out of even close, did not seem really busy Sun morning. The location isn't bad, just a bit of a walk to a subway station.

We called the front desk to complain again that there was still not hot water in our shower. We asked the girl to note our account of this second complaint for when we checked out in the morning. She assured us she would. Well, when we checked out the next morning and made reference to the two days stay without hot water in our shower, and that our account should have been noted as such that we had called twice, the gentleman who was processing our checkout said there was no record of it in their computer. We gave him the name of the girl who we had spoken to and the time we had called. No reference he said. We asked what could they do for us in reference to our experience and he said, \"Because you booked your stay online through a third party, there is nothing we can do. We don't even know how much you were charged for the rooms.\" And he proceeded to charge us the full amount for two nights plus the parking fees. We asked to speak with the manager.

Since we like coffee, it was cool to have a nice chain (Second Cup) a couple doors down from C'est What?. I'm sure there are more amazing, non-chain coffee places around there... but, this weekend was for celebration, a music fest & the most \"touristy\" stuff we could peruse, so SC was good for us. Also, the St. Lawrence Market was right down the street. You could lose yourself & time w/ all o' the \"Farmer's Market-esque\" feel indoors this place. Very cool. Check it out. Public Transportation: This is a reason I love coming back to this city. There are SO many options! This hotel is near the Street Cars (a crazy ride, let me tell you!) & their version o' the subway/metro. Also, the bus station was near as well. Taxis are everywhere & boy, are they friendly! (Seriously, I was handed a card from a driver to \"remember to call him\" for the next ride) Random: There is a Post Office down the Esplanade. Just in case you were wondering :)... Also, buy smokes in the States. The Canadian ones make you feel awful b/c they have these crazy warning labels on the pkgs and they're expensive! Closing Thoughts: Toronto is always tops on my list o' \"favorite\" places to visit. It is a great city w/ great people & I haven't even shared the other parts o' the adventure--b/c, what fun would that be? Create your own adventure! :D Visit this amazing place... and I know that I will definitely come back again (planning to in March 2011). I would stay @ the Novatel again... even if my next visit, I'll be somewhere different (b/c I'm going to be in another district o' Toronto this time).", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest", "Title": "\u201cSweet dreams\u201d", "Author": "travelandmedia Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR88732413", "Content": "Clean Hotel with superb service.

I paid the conference rate of $120, which worked out to $141 per night, including taxes. When in Toronto, I typically stay at the Sheraton Centre because it is a little closer to where I need to be. The Novotel is a little farther from the business area around Eaton Centre that I typically visit. The Novotel is also a full step below the Sheraton in terms of the hotel rating, class and amentities. The rooms were plain and basic, although sufficiently spacious. I did note a bit of an antiseptic smell in the hallway (but not in the room) when I checked in. I assume this reflected that the area was clean, but it would have been more pleasant without the smell of chemical cleaners. My room had a view of the parking garage, which is certainly less enjoyable than the view I would get on, say, the 20th floor of the Sheraton. I used room service a couple times and they were very quick and the food was excellent. The internet access was included, which is easy to forget. Being charged for internet access is a pet peeve of mine. However, the mini-bar fridge had a sign on it saying that it was not a refrigerator and that any items placed in it would be removed. That seemed a little harsh and is far from normal in my reasonably significant hotelling experience. The next time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m back in Toronto on business, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably try the Sheraton first (and a few other places second).

The desk service was rather indifferent. When I asked if there was a concierge, I was told that there wasn't, unfortunately. Nothing more! No offer to answer a question or give a direction.

Pool and hot tub area were connected by a stairway to the fairly decent gym, which had good showers with shampoo, shower gel and conditioner in dispensers and a sauna. The breakfast buffet was wonderful! Eggs benedict, french toast, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and the most delicious selection of fresh baked breads and pastries one could want! Be sure to get the breakfast buffet included, especially if you are going to walk around the city for any length of time. Plus, the hosts and servers at the restaurant are excellent! They are far more friendly than the desk staff, with smiles and cheerful greetings! The waitstaff are quite attending and deserve their tips! I was looking around after I sat down with my food, wondering if I should get up to get some juice, when a waiter asked if I needed anything. It was at the same time I noticed where the juice was.

NO apology for the wait and no explanation as to what happened.

The staff were very helpful and kept our bags for us both on our early arrival and late check out, so we could go touring about. There are several lovely outdoor restaurants just down the street and the St. Lawerence Market is a must to check out. The rooms were exactly as represented on the website and we had a nice view of the main street. For the price and location, this place was perfect for our stay.", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - budget bedding\u201d", "Author": "lifterguy", "ReviewID": "UR74781750", "Content": "Arriving at the Novotel, I was greeted promptly and professionally at the front desk and quickly checked-in. The desk clerk offered me a map and provided instructions for getting into their clean and well-lit parking garage. (Parking is $20 per day extra.) The hotel public areas were clean and inviting. The elevators were fairly fast. They required a room key-card to access the upper floors - a little annoying, but a nice safety feature. The fifth floor room had basic furnishings that were in good condition: Two queen size beds with night stands attached to the wall, a desk, dresser, and a couple of comfortable chairs by the window. The TV was a standard tube set, with basic cable. The bathroom was clean with plenty of counter space and nice lighting. A hair dryer, iron and ironing board were all provided. There was no fridge, except for a mini-bar with the usual overpriced items. The hotel offers free wireless internet, and the signal appeared to be strong, but the speed was very slow - freezing at times. Don't depend on using the wireless internet if you really intend to get any work done. The bed was uncomfortably firm. Each bed had three smallish feather pillows, and three smaller decorative throw pillows. When we went to get into bed, we found it had been made with just one white flat sheet (that barely covered the mattress) and the comforter with no blanket or top sheet. I doubt the comforter gets washed between guest, so I can't imagine guests using the bed this way. (And the comforter would have been way too warm for an August night - even with the air conditioning.) I found a blanket and two spare sheets in the closet, so I re-made the bed with a top sheet and a blanket. The sheets and blanket all looked like the kind you would find in a cheap budget motel. Noise from the hallway would intrude into the room when people talking would pass by outside - fortunately the hallway was quite during most of our visit. Lighting in the room was just barely adequate. Bedside lights built into the headboards looked sleek, but were not all that good for reading. The hotel has a workout room that has a couple of treadmills, 2 elliptical trainers, 2 exercise bikes, and a stair stepper machine. There is also a small selection of weight machines, and even some free weights. It's not a substitute for a full size gym, but it's enough for a basic workout. There is also an indoor pool, which we did not use. Overall it's a nice hotel, and the location close to Yonge Street and St. Lawrence Market is terrific. The price we paid was competitive with other downtown Toronto hotels - but I still ended up feeling like we spent too much for what we got.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Place\u201d", "Author": "piper181", "ReviewID": "UR73292671", "Content": "This is a gem of a place with a great location, nice people, and comfy rooms all at a reasonable price.

The hotel is fairly conveniently situated, close to Union Station (about a 10-15 minute walk, less if you know your way around, which we do). The location is convenient to some nice restaurants, both chain and non-chain, some convenience stores, and coffee houses, but it's overall nothing special -- it's on the outskirts of downtown's financial district. But it's very easy to walk from the hotel to more interesting places, and there's the subway at Union Station. The hotel is very comfortable. We upgraded to an executive room, which was much quieter. The room was huge, with a big King-size bed, comfortable work area, big bathroom, and big windows. Everything was nicely decorated, clean, and worked. Staff were very friendly and accommodating, We didn't eat at the hotel (we know Toronto very well, and know where to go for good dinners), but the conference supplied breakfast via the hotel, and this was extensive and tasty. The meeting rooms at the hotel were large and worked well, but there was lots of construction nearby, and this noise was audible in the meeting rooms. The hotel staff were apologetic, but there was little they could do about it. Overall, we were very comfortable at the hotel. Apart from the little bit of construction noise during the day, it was very quiet (it's not on a particularly busy street), and staff were helpful. If you don't mind not being right in the centre of things (it's a 15 minute walk to the Eaton Centre, 15 minute subway ride to Bloor/Yonge), this is a good choice.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cGood value, no frills hotel in an excellent location\u201d", "Author": "GingerMax", "ReviewID": "UR39784030", "Content": "My wife and I were visiting family in Kingston, from England, and had booked two nights stopover at the Novotel on the outward journey, and one night two weeks later on our return. We booked through Canadian Affair at the same time as our flights, and the price seemed very reasonable. We had noted some of the Tripadvisor comments - especially concerning building noise and car parking, but since we did not expect to be in during the day, and did not have a car, we were prepared to give it a go. The hotel is an older building with much more charm than the usual glass and metal lookalike monstrosities, and looks as though it should be situated on a tree-lined boulevard, possibly facing a nice park. It is, however, located in a slightly gloomy, unprepossessing backwater of a street between similarly miserable buildings. On our arrival there were two front desk staff on duty, and we were dealt with promptly and politely. We were immediately offered an upgrade to a higher spec. room for an extra $50 per night. We were told that this would include a free buffet breafast, which at $15.99 per person per day would make up for much of the extra cost, so we took this option. In common with most hotels we were asked for a credit or debit card to cover any additional expenses. Despite the lack of activity we were not shown to our room. The 9th (top) floor room was plainly decorated, but clean and with everything you could reasonably require. The bed was a very large double, and extremely comfortable. There was a television with a menu which immediately defaulted to the film options. There was at first a little confusion as to how it's menu system worked. There was a minibar which we had no intention of using, and a notice made it clear that it was not a fridge, and that any movement of the items in it, or of the bottled water would incur a charge. This could easily have been overlooked. There was a safe, large enough for a laptop, and a good bathroom with instant hot water. It was spotlessly clean. The view, from the back of the hotel was of a depressing multistorey car park with apartments above, but with the blinds closed it did not matter. The air conditioning system (essential) could be set to one's preference and worked perfectly. The inclusive buffet breakfast was excellent, with a really wide choice of everything imaginable, and as much as you could eat ! They advertise ' the best bread in town' and they are absolutely right. Suberb. The restaurant and bar staff were very friendly. The hotel has several hundred rooms, but it was not exactly vibrant with guests. Was this because it was unpopular, or just a slack midweek period ? However this did make our stay pleasantly peaceful. Some drilling noise started outside at 1000, but this had been notified to us, and was not too bad. The bar was expensive, as was the restaurant and 'Cafe Nichole', with a rather limited menu not to our taste, but there are very many places to suit all tastes nearby. There is a useful convenience store next door. The location is extremely convenient for all the downtown attractions, shops, restaurants and theatres, St. Lawrence Market, only two blocks away from the Union Station and minutes away from the CN Tower. Rooms have to be vacated by 1200, which is later than many, but when we told the desk staff that our train was not until mid-afternoon, they immediately told us we could retain the room until 1430 at no extra charge. When we checked out the first time, we noticed we had been charged for two films, which we had not watched, but had triggered due to unfamiliarity with the TV menu. We were told our bill would be amended, but we still got charged for one of them (about $14). We had made one phone call to our Kingston relatives, which turned out rather expensive. Beware not to use a Cash Passport (instead of credit card) to cover extras. Even if you do not incur any extra expenses, the hotel takes out a substantial amount straight away, then refunds it much later, leaving you short of cash for much of your stay. On our return for one night a fortnight later, we were allocated our 'standard' double room on the 7th floor. It was barely any different from the upgraded room we had used previously, except for being fractionally smaller, no glass table and curtains instead of blinds - which we preferred anyway. Our only critiscism was the slightly tired carpet. Everything else was identical, and otherise spotless. I think we had been ripped off with the upgrade. The daytime drilling noise seemed to have finished. We were much more careful with the TV menu this time ! The desk staff arranged a limo' type taxi to the airport at a flat rate of $55, and it arrived promptly. For short stays certainly, the Novotel is good value and excellently situated.

I thought, well it is a busy weekend and maybe he was tired from the activity as we were checking in about 3pm. When we arrived to the floor of our hotel room I could smell cigarettes, odd because I was told I would be on a non-smoking floor. The hallway was dimly lit and once in the room I was shocked at the relative cramped space and the view of the construction and restaurant outside of my window was disheartening. It was not centrally located to the parade route as I was told and was again put off by the staffs lack of knowledge. The concierge, questionable at best if that is what she was, had a bad attitude towards certain tourists and gave me the impression that this hotel was not as \"cosmopolitan\" as it appeared in the advertisements. She acted as though I was invisible and did not offer anymore knowledge than what I could have picked up in the brochures provided in the lobby. I originally chose this hotel because I felt it was a nice place to stay for my children and mother but in hindsight would have chosen one of the more popular hotel chains and may have gotten what I expected.

On arrival, there was one person manning the Front Desk, and a line up of 7 or 8 people waiting to check in. Front Desk advised me that there were no 2 Queen Bed rooms remaining. It felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode, as I questioned the front desk : how could there be no more 2 Queen Bed rooms left when I made my reservation 3 months ago and pre-paid for them? Although he wasn't rude, he was altogether unhelpful. I was given a room with a double bed and a pull-out couch. I've slept on bunk beds more comfortable than that pull-out. I put my make-up bag on the counter and accidentally knocked over the 2 water bottles on sensors. Next thing I know, I see 2 water bottles on my bill which the Front Desk did not mention on checkout; I noticed it when I had to specifically request the hotel receipt. Again at check-out, another line of 7 or 8 people waiting with one person manning the Front Desk. I was shocked that there was no in-room Checkout system in place. Since we had to stay in a substandard room, I asked for free parking [one night = $20]. (Note: This was not offered and Front Desk was waving me away without further attempt to rectify the situation). My request was refused and I was given a free continental breakfast, which I turned down since there are much better places to eat nearby. I used to live in Toronto and for a tourist, it may be okay, particularly if you are on a budget and don't mind a bit of walking. It's close to St. Lawrence Market, the ACC, CN Tower, Skydome (now Rogers Centre) and the Hummingbird Theatre. In the summer, it's about a 10 minute walk to the Lakeshore and Union Station {subway, train and GO station}. Being that I am originally from Toronto, I am disappointed and embarrassed of such pettiness displayed. I would hate for a traveler to get the wrong impression that Novotel exemplifies typical Canadian / Toronto customer service.

I booked a discount package deal (two nights plus buffet breakfast each morning) through the hotel's own website and when we got there, they claimed to not have our reservation in the computer. Luckily, I had my confirmation email and they had to give us the discounted rate I had booked (through their own website!). Apparently, when packages change they simply delete the old reservations for the packages that have ended out of their system. Don't try to check in without your confirmation number! We also did not get the breakfast we were expecting :( Oh, and worst of all - they cheated us (nearly $20) on a currency exchange. We had no idea until we were out and about on the town (will admit we should have done some research first, but who would have thought the hotel would be so underhanded?) Exchange your money at a bank or at the border - don't do it at this hotel! The best thing about this hotel is the location.

We had a king size bed, wide screen tv with lots of channels, seating area, tea and coffee making facilities, wardrobe and safe and full size modern bathroom. Rooms were thoroughly cleaned. The only dis advantage I would point out was the vw - if you are at the front of the hotel you over look a building site or the back of the hotel is just blocks of flats so try and get on the back as it is a lot quieter!! We never tried breakfast but the price looked pretty good compared to City Prices. My boyfriend used the pool and sauna which were pool clean. One thing I would say about this hotel is the staff were great. The guy on Concierge helped us every day with our plans even though we didnt book any trips through him. Also after our stay in Toronto we were going to Niagara for 2 nights and didnt really want to take our huge cases so we left them free of charge in left luggage until we came back to Toronto to fly home :) Another handy hint there is a small super market next door which sells all sorts and lots of restaurants just over the roday from the hotel. Spaghetti Factory is amazing inside and really good value for money. The location of the hotel is good - 2 mins walk from the Railways Station and about 5 mins to the CN tower and 10 mins to the HarbourFront.

She then said no kings were available at this time. She did call to see if any were being cleaned and told us to come back for 3pm. We had no problem with this. (At the same time another couple were checking in and I overheard he booked a king smoking room - 6th floor and he had NO problems - why is that?) At 3pm we got another person behind the desk and again he says \"for queen\". I told him we just went through this already and told me to then wait and talk to the girl I had spoken to earlier. When I did she said she had a room available...then the guy I spoke to comes over and says to me that (within that 5mins) that it did NOT show a king available. My husband overhears and comes over to counter and is a little upset. He could not understand when he pays in full for a specific room and he has hassles...then the guy talks condescendingly to him and states that it is only \"a request and that I guess you has never booked with hotels before\"...and while my husband is still speaking to him, decides to ignore him; speak over him and proceed to tell me the facilities available. I found this VERY RUDE. In our room the bathroom toilet did not flush properly which was very frustrating. It would take you at least 4 TIMES to flush toilet paper down. The scrambled eggs at breakfast were runny (and I am not a picky eater). There was good selection. Upon check out again not smooth. We were told we owed some more money...1 long distance charge (approx. $40) and breakfast. We said that charge was not ours (that we never even picked up the telephone receiver once in our room)...that was fixed...and for breakfast that was already on the bill so there was no need to mention that; a little confusing.

Check in was efficient and I was \"sold\" an upgrade to a superior room that promised to \"redfine the hotel room experience,\" or some such. Elevators sometimes required and sometimes read key cards to access your floor. The room itself was very large, modern with accents in primary colors and very clean and new-looking. What was to \"redefine\" the traditional hotel stay was the large white bathroom. This was accessed through translucent panelled doors in one corner of the room. The most unusual aspect of the bathroom however was the large soaking tub with \"rain shower\" fixture overhead and adjacent large widow looking back into the bedroom area. A \"privacy screen\" for this could be lowered electronically from inside of the bathroom. Unfortunately this screen was placed on the bedroom-side of the window allowing little ones (or whoever one is wanting privacy from) to simply lift the curtain and see full scale into the bath unit! Overall room maintenance and cleanliness was excellent except the desk light was not functioning and the in-bed reading lights were of a low wattage and not particulary functional in design. As it was a very wintry night, I opted to eat dinner in the hotel's restaurant as there were extremely limited options (Spaghetti Factory, Keg and Le Papillon (I ate there last summer and found it uninspired)) within easy walking distance. Upon entering the dining room, I was struck by the relatively small number of customers versus the large number of dirty tables and dirty plates on every flat service in sight. Apparently a large office party had just left. It took a few tries to get silverware, water and a glass of wine. But after this I found the service personnel, though frazzled, to be very friendly, knowledgeable and even funny. It seems many of them had been with the restaurant since its opening. My dinner of French onion soup (way too thick with bread) and croque monsieur (very dry) with salad was serviceable but hardly inspired. Overall, I had slightly above-average stay at this property.

Most of the restaurants they recommended were expensive, and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay that much for every dinner.

This week I had the privledge of staying at Novotel. What could have been a disappointing stay turned out just simply marvellous because of a dedicated and customer driven employee, Ms. Rhonda Wilson. This week was the films festival in Toronto Canada. I fould it extremely difficult to book a hotel during the week of September 11 - 17 any where in down town Toronto. I had called several hotels and was just flatly refused, we are sold out, good-bye. This was not the case with Rhonda Wilson of Novotel, Toronto Centre. She advised me they were booked but promised to keep me updated on the capacity of the hotel. True to her word she called me backand advised that she was able to accomodate me for Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday night. She will also recommend that I spend the Monday night at one of the hotels other property in Missasagua if I did not mind. She then went on to find out whether or not I need transportation to the hotel and pre-arranged cab service for us. When I arrived at the hotel on Sunday evening, there I met Ms. Wilson, a very energetic and smiling employee who welcomed me and my business partner to the hotel. She assisted us with our check in and came to our rooms to ensure we were pleased with our surroundings. She again remined us that at present she was unable to accomodate us the following night due to the overbooking but had made arrangements for us to stay at one of the other properties in Missasagua. We would then return on Tuesday to check into the Toronto Centre for the remainder of the week. Ms. Wilson also made recommendations for dinner, arranged transportation to and from the hotel each day as well as our transfer to the Missagua hotel. Each evening she checked on us to see how our day went, were there any questions or concerns. You were simply welcomed and felt at home. I personally observed Ms. Wilson in action with other guest as this was an extremely busy time at the hotel as all hotels in Toronto were over booked. Yet she was calm, warm, friendly, courteous and professional to each guest walking through the door. The service Ms. Wilson gives guarantees return vistors to Novotel and Toronto Canada. Employers should pay special recognition to such Star employees. Had I not encountered Ms. Wilson in making my reservations at Novotel, my business trip would have had to be postponed which would have resulted in a major delay. Going above and beyond is what makes or breaks the tourist destination. Ms. Wilson is truly an AMBASSADOR for Toronto and the Novotel chain. This is excellence in it's truest form.

A few beggars / pan handlers of an evening in area ( not at hotel but at bars / restaurants across road) but they seemed to be non aggressive .", "Date": "April 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cDon't Stay Here\u201d", "Author": "blindmind", "ReviewID": "UR3287396", "Content": "The Problems: - EXTREMELY RUDE employees- ESPECIALLY if you have a web based reservation (they treated me like I was on welfare). - Tons of HIDDEN costs (e.g. didn't mention parking fee when I checked in charged me $20 for one night of parking when I checked out). - The room was as far as possible from the elevator (even though the hotel was nearly empty).

The location was great - close to Union Station and walking distance from many restaurants and shopping areas in Toronto. My booking was a little troublesome. I had called ahead of time and requested a pre-authorization form be faxed to me so I would be able to bill it to my company Visa. The form was faxed a week later, after my company had contacted them three times. Upon arriving at my room after a tiring flight, my room door was held wide open using a bath towel. I was unsure if someone was still cleaning it or if it was to air-out the room (I'm assuming the latter since cleaning staff never came back to my room). My Internet service was problematic. After 1 hour of playing with the modem, one call to concierge and one call to the actual Internet supplier, we realized that the previous tenant had stolen the power jack to the in-room modem. However, the hotel staff were very speedy in replacing it and restoring the Internet access to the room. My sleep could be better. I was awaken at 4am everyday to someone running up and down the stairs (I was located near the end of a wing). I'm assuming they were delivering the complementary newpaper to each guest but it was disruptive nonetheless. When checking out, I did not recieve a statement of the amount that had been charged. I called twice after leaving the hotel before a statement was faxed to me. Despite the hardships, the hotel is secure (a keycard operated elevator!) and the staff are friendly. They were helpful in finding locationsin Toronto. The telephone operator could be more available as there were several times that I called and no one was there to pick-up the telephone. As my review title states, it's a great location but a little more work into detailing would give Novotel the \"umph\" that it needs.", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the price\u201d", "Author": "iamthespark", "ReviewID": "UR3205812", "Content": "Stayed just 1 night for New Years.

Okay hotel. As previously stated by another reviewer (maybe more), the rooms are dated and the carpet alone almost made me give this hotel 2 stars - stained and old. We solved the problem of the snacks on the sensor pads by having them immediately removed from our room by calling the front desk. That said, the room was clean and the staff efficient and courteous. Everything was in walking distance and this was in 40 degree weather. Previous reviewers that have said it's not close enough must really be out-of-shape. There are at least 50+ restaurants and hundreds of stores plus many theaters within a 15 minute walk. Would I stay here again? I guess that would depend on the price of nearby hotels. We paid $266 with taxes for 2 nights (parking is another $16).
