{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Funky Fortune Hotel My partner have just returned from Beijing. We spent three interesting nights at the Fortune-Land International.A funky hotel, with mushroom lights on the ceilings, fancy entrance and egg shaped couches in the lobby. There must be a drought in Beijing because none of the fountains were working.Getting there:Make sure you get clear instructions on how to get to the hotel should you need to travel by taxi to the Hotel. I recommend travelling into Beijing from the airport by train or bus then get a taxi to the Hotel, preferably between peak traffic hours. This should save you heaps of travel time and angst.There is a building site next door in the early stages of development and a railway station down the road. Expect to hear brief thunderous noises occasionally throughout the night from the train station (I think).Our room:Our room was clean and spacious. Not bad for 566RMB a night!The free internet offered as part of the tariff did not work due to a faulty computer. When we enquired twice about fixing our PC we were given some reason which I could not understand and told to use the business centre for a fee. For the non-smokers, make sure you insist on a non-smoking room. As in most hotels, you can clearly smell the difference.Our bath/shower was clean however the water only came out as a trickle compared to the pressure from a usual hotel room. We asked for this to be fixed however nothing was done.Our King Size bed sheeting was clean however the mattress was hard. This was good for my bad back, however my partner endured some loss of sleep. The reverse cycle heating works well. Pump it up to 32degrees to keep warm during the cold Beijing nightsHotel Facilities:The inclusive breakfast (1 per room and then 30RMB for the second guest) offered a broad selection. The cakes and pastries were clearly stale, however the (sweet) bread for toasting was okay once you got the toaster working. I enjoyed the pear juice. Furthermore, the head chef cooked my omelette with a bit too much oil. Even so, it was quite nice.There are also massage facilities in the hotel, however I consider the price excessive so did not partake.Our Tips:Having a good grasp of conversational Mandarin (or in my case a friend who does), is essential when staying at this hotel. The staff are generally friendly and helpful, but speak only basic limited English. I had to refer many enquiries through my friend.We suggest you brave the traffic and go to the new Soho area for meals up the road.In summary, not yet Westerner Friendly but a good start.", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR222468747", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "laneand"}, {"Content": "Don't stay here unless you want to be ripped off! We had prepaid for a room through sinohotel.com thinking we got a good deal. The website claims it is 4 stars. I would give it 1 or 2 at best. The room is ok, but the shower leaks on the floor and runs into the carpet. I had to ask for more toilet paper cause it was soaked, along with the towels. The hotel claims that it is only a 10 minute walking distance from the subway, it is more like 20, and the taxi driver had a hard time finding it.The website also offers a swimming pool and fitness facility which was closed. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else, I doubt this hotel will stay open for long anyways.", "Date": "Aug 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR300219892", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "dryoo2"}, {"Content": "Horrific Experience We arrived at this hotel on August 7th and were immediately taken back by the dilapidated state of the property. From hotels.com we knew we weren\u9225\u6a9b expecting a five-star hotel as the Fortuneland had been given three and a half stars. However this hotel was two stars at best. The staff was very pleasant and inviting however the lobby was under maintenance and the whole ambience just seemed run down. We got our room and after proceeding down a dark hallway with no lighting we had to ask the maid where our room was on the 7th floor since there were no room numbers. We opened the door to the smell of musty mold, probably from a carpet that hadn\u9225\u6a9b been replaced in the last 20 years. On top of that the bed was THE HARDEST bed I have ever felt in my life. Don\u9225\u6a9b get me wrong, I love sleeping on firm mattresses but this was just ridiculous. Bathroom was set up awkwardly with no separate shower area or shower door. You just shower in the bathroom without an enclosure. Leaking pipes, some drilling going on and that horrible horrible smell. Needless to say we packed up, went down stairs, complained to the manager and came to a compromise on our previously non-refundable reservation. The manager named Andy was extremely helpful and understanding. We then took a chance with a brand new five-star hotel in the Central Business District of Beijing named Bohao Radegast Hotel located at #15 Guanghua Road across the street from Hatsune restaurant (#1 Trip Advisor Beijing) and that turned out to be marvelous and truly five-star.", "Date": "Aug 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR917401223", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Run4TheCup"}, {"Content": "Good ideas but poor execution The design of the hotel on the paper was really interesting. It could have been really a fantastic place. Bold design , very large rooms and expensive materials could have made this hotel one of our favorite in Beijing. Alas, the execution is of such bad quality that after two years the place is falling appart.Something must have happen to this hotel between the planning and the curent management because you feel that the current management does not get the spirit of the initial design. We were there during the Xmas season and they put all kind of cheap Xmas decorations in their expensive design entrance... not pretty! The staff is young, not trained and not trying too hard.My advice don't stay there if you want clean room and good breakfast. The breakfast is a joke, something you normally experience in 2 stars hotels in small chinese cities. Everything is so strangely organized in this place (or rather not-organized) that it takes a lot of time going through the simple process of check-in and check-out. The hotel rooms were so-so clean but the corridors and lifts were badly maintained (or should I say, not maitained?).", "Date": "Jan 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR933757772", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Chinesechou"}, {"Content": "Musty and nasty.

The lobby had some additional pink and green lights on the ceiling. The restaurant had been moved upstairs, but I didn't try it. The pool was still closed, but the workout room open. There's a massage place on the first (second to Americans) floor. The room was comfortable, the internet worked great, and the staff was friendly. In fact, I was stunned to run into a fellow named Grand (maybe the assistant manager) in the lobby who remembered me, and even the room number I stayed in the previous time, several months earlier! Business seemed to be good, both business people and families. My next door neighbor seemed to be having an all night party, but the room was soundproofed enough (or I was tired enough to be out cold) so as not to bother me. It was strange that nearly every staff member had a name badge that said Trainee (other than the aforementioned Grand) and while some of the front desk staff seemed a little tenative, service was generally good.
