I am happy to say that our expectations were surpassed. The service, from the moment we walked in the door to our very early early departure just this morning, was fantastic. The hotel itself is older, but the lobby and our room were very clean and well-maintained. We got a suite which was large and very comfortable. The pool was great and the restaurant was a great value. The front desk staff were excellent and so helpful (special kudos to Mike). I can not say enough about Wallace, the concierge - one of the greatest ambassadors of Chicago I have met during my visits to this great city. We crammed a lot into our few days in Chicago, and from day one, as we walked back in the doors, exhausted after very busy days, this felt like home. Thanks so much to all the staff for a great vacation! Oh, and whoever arranged for the 80 degrees for 3 days straight (in March, yet!): thanks for that!!!", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, MI", "Title": "\u201cHONEST REVIEW\u201d", "Author": "MOTOR-CITY-TRAVELLER", "ReviewID": "UR126209943", "Content": "We visited Chicago briefly on February of 2012 for site seeing and shopping. While in Chicago we wanted to stay at a hotel in downtown which was close to some of the attractions and shopping centers. While surfing through the net, we came across several hotels. What attracted us the most about 'BEST WESTERN PLUS' hotel was its location and free parking. Most everyone knows that downtown Chicago hotels are expensive and parking is not cheap. The hotels rates range from $150 to $500 a night and parking varies from $20 to $30 a day. Some places even charge more for parking if once you leave the facility and return. The Best Western Plus River North cost $109/night with king sized bed or $97 for AAA members and free parking. It is located in the center of all the action. One can walk, catch a cab, take the bus or train to any destination. The hotel has a huge lobby, restaurant, indoor pool on the roof, sit out patio next to the pool, and a small gym. The hotel is actually two different buildings connected together by a bridge. All four sided of the hotel over looks streets and other building in Chicago. The only side we found interesting was the McDonald's side. We were told that there were only a few rooms available which over looked the McDonald's and one would have to call in the morning of the day of arrival to reserve one of these rooms. The McDonald's is one of the biggest in the country, which is made of all glass and has two floors. It has an up/down escalator and elevators with luxurious contemporary sofa style seats. The view of McDonald's is fabulous from the inside and outside. Next to McDonald's are the Rain Forest Cafe, Hard Rock Cafe and the Sports Authority which has eight floors. The hotel has 6 floors with fast elevators, bright lights and clean halls with vending machines, ice makers, etc. We stayed in a room with King Size bed, which was very spacious, clean and quiet. The room also had a TV, desk/chair, a recliner chair, a safe for personal belongings, and coffee maker. The lighting was adequate and the bathroom had hair dryer and iron/ironing board. Although the tub was a little small for my taste, it was enough to just take a shower. The hotel had room service and free Wi-Fi. The hotel has no kids\u2019 activity but provides a big lobby with a nice restaurant/bar. Free continental breakfast and coffee was also a plus. One thing we found while staying at the hotel was that they offered discount tickets to various attractions around the areas. For example: We visited the Shed's Aquarium, which was about 3 miles from the hotel. Shed's website charges $35 + $5 as on-line fee ($40) for an adult. At the hotel the same ticket cost $27, a savings of $13 for each adult, which was even better than the AAA rate. While in Chicago, keep in mind that the GPS in your car will keep losing signal due to the high rise buildings, long bridges and tunnels. Having a map handy will help you navigate better around town with less frustration. I hope this review helps everyone in determining if this is the best hotel for you. I have attached a few pictures of the place and its surrounding areas.

It's one of the few (maybe only) downtown Chicago hotels that offers free parking and is well located to walk to interesting restaurants and Michigan Avenue shopping. The hotel has a nice indoor rooftop pool (but not jacuzzi..slightly disappointing) and well-appointed rooms and everything's very clean.. The room decor is distinctive and pleasing (cool greens & grays) and staff friendly if not fully informed (a desk clerk recommended a restaurant that had been out of business for 5 months and a bill for the night got slid under our door though we'd booked via Skoosh-- a mistake readily remedied but shouldn't have happened!) Also Internet was down part of the time. But that may not happen often: we talked to a self-identified business traveler on the (small!) elevator who volunteered that he'd stayed there repeatedly over a number of years and always been satisfied. To avoid city garbage truck noise that other posts warn against, we requested a room on the top (5th) floor. The noise did wake me anyway, but not for long, and probably unavoidable in a cty. The hotel was quiet inside although fully booked and with some families. Booking tip: we had got what we thought was a best possible rate by booking with a discount service about 6 weeks in advance. I felt glad of the foresight when I checked again about 3 days in advance with the hotel website (as we could cancel the other booking), for the hotel was totally sold out. But, surprisingly, the bill slipped under the door was for $25. LESS than we'd paid! Another time we'd find the best refundable rate well in advance but check about 1-2 weeks in advance directly on the hotel site, which might offer the best deals. We'll in any case likely stay here again, which we can't say about many of the hotels in the north-of- Chicago-loop area we've tried.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cFriendly service and perfect location\u201d", "Author": "heatherh1313", "ReviewID": "UR121103732", "Content": "Although we only stayed here 1 night and didn't get a chance to experience breakfast, we were met with very friendly employees and had a smooth check in/check out process.

All in all, this one falls under, you get what you pay for. The Service Nothing terribly special about the service although everyone was friendly enough. The check in / out processes were quick. The concierge service was helpful and did assist us in purchasing discounted tickets to the city tour bus. The Room The room was nothing special but it was clean. The view from our room was of a back alleyway and was actually quite uncomfortable as our windows were only 10 feet across from a series of residential balconies. The walls are paper thin, as are the ceilings. Normally not complainers, we had to call the front desk to ask them to request the party above us stop stomping/jumping at 11pm. The desk complied and for the most part the noise subsided. None of us slept well unfortunately. We had a coupon to upgrade to a suite, however at 3pm they were sold out of suites. Amenities Once you figure out which elevator to take to the pool be prepared to be at a splash party. Admittadly not a huge kid person, the pool was infested at all times with tons of kids and kid toys. A quiet adult swim from perhaps 9-10 before the pool closes would have been appreciated. The free wifi does not work except for very early in the morning when few guests are on. Be prepared to hand over your car keys on arrival, your car will be parked for you and only accessible upon request. We were not prepared for that and it caused a bit of a rush to unload the car with limited parking space but the attendants were nice. Location The location was great and the best part of this hotel, most notably close to the hop on / hop on tour bus stop, within walking distance to the Miracle Mile and to good restaurants.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGood location for sightseeing in Chicago.

We had a side bathroom to the sink counter with a door that closes tightly to the toilet or gets caught on the shower mat with the door clearance.

Every morning, we were able to easily walk for breakfast. The free trolley for the Navy Pier is just a short walk away from the hotel. One day we walked a few blocks to the Magnificent Mile, and even made time to enjoy a deep dish pizza in the hotel's Pizzeria Ora. Since we knew that we would spend very little time in our room, I wanted to spend as little as possible on a clean, adequate room. This Best Western met all of our needs and then some. The staff was helpful and friendly, we took advantage of the discounted ticket for some of the area's attractions that are available at the front desk. One afternoon we briefly visited the roof top pool, and were the only people at the pool. I must admit, the view is a little lame thought.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNot Worth the Free Parking\u201d", "Author": "mykcrealtor", "ReviewID": "UR115861039", "Content": "We chose this hotel exclusively for the location and the free parking, both of which we did enjoy.

I read some other comments stating that it took literally hours to get a car from the parking garage. We did not have this problem (--probably because we did not travel in the summer?). - Good location: Art Institute of Chicago, Navy Pier and Goal Coast are just within walking distance from the hotel. You can find good restaurants nearby (such as Rainforest & Maggiano's Little Italy). The most important thing is that Mag mile is just few blocks away! We left our rental car at the hotel and visited Chicago mostly by foot. Only when we wanted to visit a farther neighborhood, we got the car with no charge. A supermarket is also closeby and it is practical for us who travelled with a baby. - Clean room: yes, the room is clean & comfortable. The bathroom is clean although I am not big fan of that black painted floor. The fridge is a bit tired. No microwave (not practical for moms who need to heat up baby bottle). The employees are friendly and helpful. As I expected, we could hear the noise from the street, especially when big motorcycles passed by.

It is nice and cheap, but you will need a car to get over to the laundry place. Please just ask the front desk staff and they will definitely help you out like they did to us. :] The room doesn't has microwave, and the coffee makers can only make 1 cup at a time, but they do have a place in the lobby that you can make tea, hot chocolate or coffee for free. Also, you can always ask the front desk staff to warm up some food for you if you really need the microwave :] One thing that bothers me is you can hear quite well when people are talking or walking in the hall way.

It was very clean, the bed comfy and the service staff was good. We had heard a lot about noise issues, but never had the slightest trouble. The floors were a little creaky up on the higher floors, but we stayed on the second and they were fine. The pool is a little confusing to get to the first time.

The room definitely disappointed. The air conditioning unit is loud and disturbed our sleep on many nights. We stayed over the July 4 weekend which perhaps is why the hallways and adjacent rooms were so noisy on the one night. Also, the proximity to a downtown firehall added to the late night noise, with sirens, etc. The restaurant on site was only marginally helpful in that we used complimentary breakfast coupons (which I found on the web before we arrived) however each day the same dish was prepared differently by the kitchen so we were really not sure what we were going to get from day to day. The nicest feature of the hotel is the 7th floor pool and outdoor deck where you can swim and then head outside for a fabulous view of the Chicago skyline. We also planned a visit to Six flags Chicago and purchased tickets online but were unable to print out the tickets at the hotel's business center due to the outdated software on the available computer. However, the front desk staff were accomodating in helping us by allowing us to email the link to them and they then printed out the tickets we needed. Parking is free which is helpful in downtown Chicago as even the McDonald's restaurant across the street from the hotel charges for parking.

When I then called their toll-free number for clarification, I was told the room I wanted is actually available, but at a higher rate than was displayed online. Talk about bait and switch! In addition, their \"Best Available\" rate (the rate category that pops up by default) is, literally, the HIGHEST rate. So, don't be fooled by this - instead, open the rate menu and look at the other (all of them lower) rate categories. In addition, it's very difficult to figure out what the BW cancellation policy is. We had to email them to find out (turns out that it varies by rate category, apparently), then later when I tried to confirm the policy with a BW customer service rep by phone, she argued with me that it was different than what we had been emailed.

There is also a small workout room with treadmills,weight machine and stepper it has a small tv for viewing and towels are provided. There are several restaraunts within a two block radius to choose from. Michigan Avenue and all it has to offer and State Street is within walking distance if you are up for it.

CONS: Forget about going in-and-out with the free parking...our car was held hostage for two days blocked and buried in an over-parked lot on Labor Day weekend. It was a BIG hassle waiting for the lot attendant to move other vehicles so we could get out. We cancelled our trip to the Lincoln Park Zoo and evening drives on Lakeshore Ave because of this. Pedestrian decor. Odd-layout that is easily learned. Small and slow elevators. Elevator #2 is the slowest of the bunch. Takes a while to obtain hot water in the upper rooms.

We stayed 3 nights 3/25-3/28. I didn't expect a 4 star hotel going into this but overall it was nicer then I expected. The hotel has two buildings connected at the 4th floor level. The main building has 7 floors and includes the lobby/front desk area, restaraunt, and pool/workout room. We stayed on the 5th floor in 538 of the main bulding and feel that is the better of the two buildings access wise. If you didn't care about the pool or visiting the lobby and needed quick access to your car then building #2 is better as the elevator goes directly down to the garage without having to go outside. Our king suite was approx 16x30 feet in size, it also had a good size frige to put our left over pizza in and easily held a case of beer, two 1-gallon milks and countless juice boxes. Our room was clean and did not smell, carpet was in newer condition, mattress was so so but we slept just fine, great pillows. Two of our kids slept on the pullout and our 2 year old in a pack-n-play. Our room did not have a microwave. The toilet and tub/shower are in a very small 6x5 room with the sink outside in the main area. There was a safe for valuables but we did not use it. Wireless internet Wi-Fi access at no charge which was certainly a suprise. The shower situation that is mentioned in other reviews still exists. You get about 3-4 minutes of good hot water then about 30-60 seconds of fairly cold water (like someone flushed a toilet), it was certainly managable but it would probably be my biggest beef of our stay. Perhaps a shower very early in th emorning or later at night would avoid the hot cold spells. The 27\" TV's brighness and contrast levels appeared to be set very low and there was no setting to adjust the brightness up. The lobby provided good coffee and complimentary granola bars. We did not have or see any brekfast coupons that others mentioned. A USA Today Newspaper was at our door every morning. The staff was VERY nice overall, going out of there way to say good morning or hello. Sure you occasionally run in to an employee who's had a bad day but you'll have that. The elevator is small just barely able to fit 4 people and a stroller. A couple of times the door would open and our family would have to wait again if there were more than 3 people already on it. However, one of the staff got off the elevator to allow us on, he took the steps! The stairs are adjacent to the elevator and during busy times of check in and check out I ended up taking the steps down to the 4th floor for ice or up to the 7th for the pool. The pool was large, clean and warm for the first two days of our stay, the third day was a little cooler but no issue for our two kids (ages 7 and 6), the 2 year old was shivering after about 20 minutes the last day. Perhaps they changed some water that prior evening or topped it off?? Good food very close, we ate at Hard Rock, RainForest and Portillos Famous Hot Dogs (awesome chili dog!) among other places. These 3 places were within a 5 minute walk. We also ate Lou Malnatis which was only like a block over and a block down, same goes for Ginos East but we got that pizza to take home. Overall I would stay here again and I would also recommend it to a friend or family member, great bang for the buck. At $107 a night with the free parking its a steal in downtown Chicago. Yeah if you're looking for the ultimate view of downtown over the river and a high end lobby and bar for a VERY special occassion, this may not be the place for you, check out the Westin River North instead, we stayed there 6 months ago and it was very nice but I expected that for a $300 a night hotel.

He was in a room behind the front desk, had to gather up all the keys, move 3 cars etc. - Allow time for your vehicle to be \"dug out\". This happened 2 mornings in a row. As stated in other reviews the location is great - walking distance to main train stations, bus lines, restaurants, Michigan Ave. etc. The Irish Pub just a block a way \"Fado's\" had great food and a fun environment. If you need internet connection - be sure to tell them - the wireless only works in the main building, otherwise you'll find yourself in the pizza parlor (the only public area w/ wireless) They did offer to move our room as all areas of the hotel do not have internet. The rooms were clean with comfortable beds, but the hotel is showing its age - paint peeling in bathroom etc. The water pressure in the shower is poor - I actually thought I was doing something wrong. We paid $90 per night - and for the price - I think this is a good hotel considering the free parking and 2 free drinks - just don't go with unrealistic expectations.", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Deal\u201d", "Author": "mllesarahk", "ReviewID": "UR6562968", "Content": "I've been to Chicago several times but this has been the best hotel I've stayed at yet. If you know Chicago you know parking downtown is an extreme rip off ($30+/day). This hotel is one of the only ones I found that gives you free parking for one car. It is very convienent, especially if you're coming in from 90/94 as it's right on Ohio Street. It is right across from the big McDonalds (very plush for Micky D's), the Rainforest Cafe and Hard Rock. Also close are California Pizza Kitchen and Big Bowl which I've heard is good. There is a big movie theatre a couple blocks up towards Michigan Ave. - and this street is only about 5/6 blocks up from the Hotel. Also if you like a good Irish pub, check out the place right around the corner from the hotel (take a right just past the hotel, it's on the next corner). As for the hotel we booked a regular room and got upgraded to a suite for free. The suite was so large it had a hallway, it was bigger than my old apartment - had a fridge and two tv's. Furnishings were nice, windows were pretty soundproof - I wasn't bothered by any noise off Ohio St. which was suprising. The pool and fitness centre are closed - till the 10th of January I think. We also got two free drink vouchers for the bar. Seriously if you don't want 4 star or a hostel this is your best bet, also much nicer than the other Best Western that's a block off Michigan Ave. - that one is under serious renovation as well.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "Twinkler", "ReviewID": "UR6542986", "Content": "The hotel is in a great location.

I bought some ear plugs so that I could make it through my second night's stay. The beds were small and the mattresses slanted in towards the middle. The exterior and interior of the hotel looked old and not well cared for. The one nice thing was the free parking, but it didn't make up for a horrible night sleep.

The pool & workout room were nice, as well, and we got free drink coupons for the bar/lounge. And did I mention the free parking?!

Stayed in a King Room, plenty of room to move around, beds are nice, very clean, vanity and sink are not in the same room as the shower and toilet.

Coffee and fruit are available in lobby in the morning, but try the restr. in the hotel, the breakfast food there is very good. Nice little bar in hotel too. Good location, close to public transportation stops. I think it's a long walk from the hotel to places like Navy Pier and Magnificint MIle considering you'll be walking a lot when you arrive at these places. In short walking distances to lots of places to eat, in all price ranges. Free parking at hotel. An attendent is there to direct you or help you. Getting to pool can be tricky if not staying in the building that has the pool. If staying on second floor, go to 4th floor and change elevators to get to pool. Pool is big and nice, but water is a little chilly. The outside deck has a super nice view of the chicago skyline. Lots of sunshine and there is nice patio furniture on it. Great place to relax after site seeing all day. Pool attendents monitor the area. Towels are available at the pool. Also changing rooms and bathrooms for guest are in the pool/workout area.
