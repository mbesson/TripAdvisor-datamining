The location of the hotel is brilliant, it is 15 minutes by car to Jumeirah beach, and around 10 minutes to Dubai Mall the biggest shopping centre in the world. The views from our room were stunning, and the cleanliness of the rooms was also fantastic. There is a 24 hours supermarket right next to the hotel, and also withing walking distance there is KFC, Pizza Hut, Coffee Shops & Restaurants and money exchangers.

I had booked two nights which had been paid for and confirmed however on arrival was told they where not prepared honour the arrangement. Most hotels where full in this area at the time and asking ten times the normal rate so to only be informed on arrival meant a very long and costly evening finding an alternative.

The front desk clerk is unfriendly and rude. The rooms are old and run down and have a strange smell to them. There were hairs throughout the sheets of my \"clean\" bed. Plug sockets next to the headboard of the bed were open with wires hanging out. The bathroom had mold and mildew everywhere, and the toilets looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while.
