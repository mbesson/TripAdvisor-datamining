My brother and I also found this great market called Mercado de San Miguel, which was great for tapas or dinner near the hostal. CONS: There was no A/C in our room, only a dinky ceiling fan which only spread the hot air. As we went around the end of June, it was extremely hot and I couldn't sleep. It was the worst part of our trip but it was probably my fault for not making sure that the room was airconditioned. It was also advertised that there would be wifi but the first night we were there, the wifi was out. After I told Ricardo, he fixed it the next day.

SERVICE: the 2 people we dealt with at Macarena were both incredibly friendly, helpful, kind and accomodating. They gave us a choice of a room with or without a balcony, asked if they could hold our bags for the day when we had to check out in the morning but didn't leave until later that evening, and offered advice and help with good restaurants, sights, plazas, museums, etc. (even offering to make reservations!). This is really what makes this hostal so worth staying at - such great people! OTHER NOTES: the rooms with balconies are wonderful for getting a nice breeze and looking out on the street but significantly louder than the inside rooms; the inside rooms are nice and quiet but get little natural light. Our shower was very small, but not a huge deal. Paid about 69 Euros/night over the weekend, which was a good deal in comparison with the many others we looked at.

How crazy was that? But our daughter was spending 6 weeks there on a study abroad, and, well ....... we wanted to go too! So it was with some degree of surprise and delight that we realized what a gem of a hotel we managed to book, considering that the entire old city of Madrid was basically booked out by the time we made our arrangements. First the location ... it was right by the Chuchilleros gate to the Plaza Mayor ... in the most delightful little street, full of restaurants, and most notably, the most ancient restaurant/bars in the city that are embedded in the Plaza Mayor structure itself. This does not mean that it was noisy and rowdy out there in the street, the Spanish do eat late, but they're not an unruly bunch. The room we had was extremely small, but then we were only there for 3 nights (we broke our stay in Madrid up into 2 visits, with a trip to Valencia in between). There wasn't a lot of room for movement around the bed ... and our particular room had the tall shutter style windows that opened onto a central \"courtyard\" of sorts ... pretty typical of some of the very old European apartment style buildings. Another setback with some of these places is the lack of true air conditioning, however, we did have a ceiling fan, which made our nights bearable at the very least. I remember reading reviews about the air conditioning issue in some of these old Madrid hostels (small hotels with reception on 2nd floor) back in 2007 just before we went ... and of course everyone has different thresholds for discomfort, so some of the reviews posted made places like this look horrifyingly uncomfortable ... while others said it wasn't an issue. We were there in mid-summer, and it was fine. But then again, we're reasonably fit people for our age with no major health issues. Things like this should be taken into consideration, our particular room at this type of hotel could be uncomfortable for some.

It is a no frills, but friendly hostal in a good location. When I first arrived I was tired & thought the Macarena was a bit grim. Over the three days the Macarena grew on me, mainly because the staff are warm and friendly. The rooms are basic, but clean. Since it is low season, I was able to pick my room. The rooms in the front have charming old french door type windows with shutters that open onto mini-balconies above a small square. I imagine these rooms can be noisy in summer (it was quite cold so no one was sitting outside at the bars on the street). The rooms in the back face onto an internal \"air shaft\" so they would be quiet, but not bright. The rooms are painted peach, and were being freshly painted while I was there. The \"superior\" room in the back had the nicest bathroom & was larger. There is a common living room with free internet for guests. My only complaints were that my room was quite cold (those charming french-door windows are drafty) & the walls are a bit thin. Note, when I said something about the heat, the man at the desk came in to take a look & the room got slightly warmer. Nonetheless, if you go in winter take warm clothes! Overall, I got the sense that the owners care about the place, and want to make their guests comfortable.

Macarena is across the street from the renown Casa Botin restaurant, a must for visitors and locals alike. You can also find interesting tapa bars along Cava de San Miguel, one of which specializes in sizzling stuffed mushrooms and live keyboard music. Local red wine (tinto de la casa) costs about $2 a glass in these bars. While the Plaza Mayor is scenic and photogenic, food and drink at the outdoor cafes is hugely expensive. Enjoy walking around the plaza but do your eating and drinking in carefully chosen bars and restaurants nearby. Most post menus outside with prices for window shopping your choices. Look for locals inside for indications of good food and fair prices. Seniors be sure to ask for senior discounts for entry to sites having entry fees. Some do, some don't.

I was aware that they were a small family run outfit but looked forward to being right by the Plaza Mayor, the centre of all in the city we wanted to see. Booked the room wasn't too hard, we called and asked for an English speaker and seemed to be able to communicate enough to book the room, we also received a confirmation e-mail reiterating that we had requested a quiet room (we had heard the hotel was on a noisy road). When we arrived, we were a little confised as the hostal is inside a residential apartment block so we had to buzz to get in, and then pop up to the second floor in a little lift. The owner of the hostal (we presume as he was always there pretty much!) greeted us and pointed us along the corridor to our room. If i'm honest I was a little disappointed as we were in a tiny room. It was just a double bed, and two bedside cabinets touching either way, a little bathroom with stall shower and a small fitted wardrobe. The pictures I saw on here were of much larger rooms, and so we asked if they had any larger rooms avaliable but were told they were all much the same size. one of the wrost parts was our view was of a tiny interior 'courtyard' which was just a mass of rubbish and pipes. If we'd stood on the balcony we could have almost touched the opposite wall! This meant the whole of our stay, the room was cloaked in darkness with no natural light and we couldn't open the 'shutter' type exterior blind or everyone in the opposing rooms would be able to see in. As a plus though - our room was quieter than I imagine the street facing ones with a nice view are. I was really upset the day we checked in as there are speakers in the ceiling of the corridor leading away from reception blaring out pop music. Even when we closed the bedroom door, as the speaker was right outside it was still really loud. Bear in mind I'm only 25 and I was bothered by it as I'd had an early flight (we checked in about half eleven am after leaving our house at 5am) and just wanted to chill out. Plus the music seemed to be on loop...grr. We put in some wax earplugs we bought from a chemists on the way out and managed an hour's rest before waking up to go and explore. when we came back at eight p.m, the music was just as loud so thoroughly fed-up, we went out for dinner. I will say in the hotel's defence that although the music continued to a degree for the rest of 5 days we were there, it was never as loud again and could easily be blocked out by shutting the door. Positives of the hotel: The televisions - it only had BBC World, CNBC and CNN for English speakers but they are lovely flat-screens which is better than in any cheap hotel I've had in Spain before. The location - you literally could walk to everywhere you want to go in the city-sentre from Gran Via, the Museum, the Retiro, Sol, The Rastro and of course, Plaza Mayor. The El Botin restaurant, the oldest in Europe, is almost opposite and the best paellas in Madrid at La Barraca are a short walk. Cleaniless - The room was cleaned everyday whilst we were out, and to a much higher standard than you would expect at a small hotel. We always had clean towels and a hairdryer in the bathroom was an unexpected bonus!! Comfortable beds - I will say that being English, we were used to a standard double bed but our American couterparts would be disappointed at the size of the beds as they are used to at least Queen-size. Negatives - Size of rooms - honestly ours (220) was tiny, even for us who are two small people. Noise - despite the fact we couldn't hear the street, the actual hotel is noisy due to thin walls between rooms, water rushing through pipes, people living upstairs and cleaners clattering around at 9am. Night-time - As this is in residential building, you have to buzz to get in. At 2am after acting like a true Madrileno and scoping our the local bars, you feel a little like you are intruding. The night porter (usually a really friendly non-English speaking lady) has to switch the corridor lights on to show you to your room. Personally we quite liked the 'homely' feel of this, but at the same time you feel like naughty schoolkids....! Price - With I.V.A our room was 79EUR a night. I'm sure that we could get cheaper with bigger rooms had we gone further away from Plaza Mayor.... One other point is that none of the staff actually speak English to a standard whereby you could convese with them easily. I never expect people to know Ebglish fluently but they must see hundreds of English speaking tourists a year but could still only say the odd word. I would extend this comment to the rest of Madrid in fact. As opposed to trip to Barcelona last year where we ordered everything in Spanish, and they spoke back in English - In Madrid, we attempted Spanish but affirmed we were English if we didn't know the exact words for what we were trying to say but they continued to talk to us in Spanish - and not slowly either!!

Loved the proximity to Plaza Mayor, and indulged in touristy flamenco show and restuarant just 10m away from the front door because it was raining on our last night! The Metro was very convenient (Sol). The staff were helpful, and kept our luggage in a corridor on the last day so we could wander around Madrid freely. However, the rooms are just plain small, and we had a dreary view of a dark alley above a restaurant, so our room often smelled of grease. And there was a huge hole in the bathroom floor that wasn't quite covered up by the bin! Bring your own toiletries and products as this isn't pamper-heaven. However, the bed was comfortable and extra pillows were provided. Staff were pleasant. But, I probably won't be staying here again, as this is definitely not somewhere I recommend for easy-going young folk who may not be the quietest bunch. The walls must be made of paper! So little soundproofing! So, don't stay here if you are likely to want to talk to other people in your room after 10pm, for fear of causing offence to other guests! Might be better off staying in a bigger chain hotel up on Grand Via with thicker bedroom walls!", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia, pa", "Title": "\u201cgreat intimate place for the family\u201d", "Author": "wetakethekids", "ReviewID": "UR12458260", "Content": "We had a wonderful 2 days in hostal la macarena - 2 triple rooms (small, the three large twin beds crammed together spanned the length of the room, with our own baths, wardrobe and small desk) and sparkling clean. went with kids (5 and 2) and grandparents and split 2 adjoining rooms. the location is excellent; up a flight of steps to plaza mayor. we had requested inside rooms and even on the saturday night we were there, it was completely quiet even though there was commotion outside til 2-3am. ricardo and his staff were very friendly. communication was by email. we saw the balcony rooms, and they were very cute, overlooking a small square and cobblestoned one lane street. this is not a big hotel chain; it feels more like a bed and breakfast type place; situated on the second floor of an old apt complex (with the european style tiny elevators) with the other floors being residential. it's small; don't expect room service and big hotel stuff, but it's intimate, very friendly, (some english speaking staff), it'smanned 24/7 by the front desk staff and was 90euros for each triple room with a great location! excellent tapas and chocolat con churros nearby.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "CuthbertJ", "ReviewID": "UR11189495", "Content": "This is a very good hotel in a perfect location.

Only downside, is the rooms are very small...even compared to typical bite-size budget hotel rooms found across europe. If you can get past that, this place has a lot to offer: Location could not be better... it's right off one of the best streets in madrid in my opinion--some of the most authentic restaurants are nearby (including Botin, literally across the street), entrance to plaza mayor also right across the street, shops, walkable to main \"tourist\" sites and neighborhoods you'll want to see as a visitor, and just an all-around charming, fun spot. Our room had a balcony facing the street, but remarkably the shutters/doors drowned out most of the street noise at night. Staff were great--friendly, responsive, helpful. Hostal is well-maintained, kind of homey & charming, and very clean. Reception desk was manned 24/7 during our stay, and perhaps best of all-- free internet on their house computer. Our room also had a nice flatscreen tv with satellite svc. Not sure if they have a/c, but it was pleasant in early june.

They helped us with any needs that we had - even allowing us to use the computer at the checkin desk to quickly check email. The only downside is the noise from within the hotel.

However, we had a room near the front desk and could clearly hear every conversation, phone ring, and door bell.

We got an e-mail assuring us that it would be no problem. The morning of the flight we waited on the street with our luggage and after some time we went back to the hotel to find out that they FORGOT about calling the taxi while assuring us all was okay the day before!!! We were about to miss our flight, there was no taxi around and they showed absolutely no interest to help and on top of everything they were rude. Till today they take no responsibility for what had happened and they never admitted that it was their fault. We made it to the airport in the last moment by stopping a private car and convincing the driver to take us there. Tremendous stress, horrible experience!
