There are lots of restaurants nearby in the basements of malls where breakfast is cheap and lots of variety to choose from, so this is not a problem. We really liked how you can control the air conditioning in the room as many hotels do not have thermostat controls. The room is not large, but not tiny either be ause I've stayed in much smaller rooms in Singapore. Room is well designed with everything that you need and no space is wasted. The beds were very comfortable and the linens of good quality. This hotel is only a two minute walk to Orchard Rd. And the Doby Ghaut MRT station ( main interchange where 3 MRT lines meet), however, the side street that it is on has no through traffic and is very quiet at night.

At that time, the place was quite new so the taxi driver had a hard time looking for it. By now, I expect that will no longer be the case. First impression is very reassuring, the hotel is spotlessly clean with cutting edge design. It actually borders on \"Ikea-ish\" but for me, I kinda liked it :) PROS : - Front office has superb staff. Check in and out was fast, even by Singapore standards. - Requests for directions and assistance was fast and efficient. - If you get past the Austin Powers theme, the rooms are very comfortable and well-designed, despite being quite small. - Complaint about a burnt smell in our first room was dealt with promptly by an apology and an upgrade to an even larger room! - Excellent location! Around the corner is a taxi-stand, a bus stop and it is a 2 minute walk to Dhoby Ghaut subway station, which connects to anywhere in Singapore. There is a small Hainanese chicken restaurant in the station just across the escalator...excellent chicken for 2.50SGD! - Very quiet at night, too quiet even. I don't mind noise, but I know some travelers do. CONS : - uhhm...none actually ;) TIPS : - If you go to the Mustafa electronics store at night, it will be impossible to grab a taxi going home. Arguments with other people waiting will be entirely possible. Cross Farrer Park in front, there's a subway station at the other end. You'll save yourselves the stress. - There are 2 famous Hainanese chicken restaurants in Singapore. WEE NAM KEE has better chicken. BOON TONG KEE has better cereal prawns.
