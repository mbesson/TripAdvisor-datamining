Stayed there in the end for the whole duration of my holiday. such relaxed people, no sweat and good drinks, nice pool and spacious. We had the private bungalow in the back of the place, really nice, with outside shower (and one inside too) good airco, good clean linnen, and not many bugs. Really great place to stay, good to negotiate on price too, when you stay a bit longer.", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR310727867", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Wahine29"}, {"Content": "Don't ever stay in this hotel!! Not even think of it! We were stayed in this hotel about 2 years ago (Nov'04)  I still remember very well what we had while we were stayed there... My friend who lived in Bali booked this hotel as he said this hotel was ok. Then we flew from Jakarta to have a week vacation in Bali. The room that we had wasn't too bad (except all the utilities were old). So, we booked the hotel for 2 days at first, but when the 2nd day we wanted to extend, the reception told us that we couldn't extend as they already sold the room for another tourist. We were so surprised  mad! They didn't even tell us about this before  just sold the room as they like. What a polite way! We were some local tourists, but they thought we couldn't afford it if they made the room price more expensive as the weekend coming. If they trained well, they will ask us first! We're the guestguest was the king. If we didn't pay the hotel, they could did this to us, but we paid them, 2 days in advanced! They think local tourists have no enough money to spend money on their poor hotel or what!! Mostly hotelsnight clubs in Bali prefer foreign tourist than local one. They see different about the skin colours. They should change their behave to the locals. We were 2 girls from Jakarta who wanted to spend our holiday in Bali, but Bali made us very dissapointed. I love Bali, it's such a beautiful place, but the untrained employees ruined it.....", "Date": "Dec 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR270595896", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ungu_best"}, {"Content": "dont stay legian village hotel, it sucks!       exterior", "Date": "Jul 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR937817816", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "mataharimu"}, {"Content": "not too shabby.. Super friendly staff, nice pool! The toilets were reasonably 'crap'....... Nice breakfast but not much choice, take your favourite spread cos' they only have strawberry jam. 2 Minutes walk to legian beach, which is just as good as kuta, but less people. Ok waves at times, but fairly crowded.The rooms were reasonable (we had a superior room)...... maybe the worst thing is it takes a while for hot water to come through when u want a shower...", "Date": "May 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR606519223", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Rough looing rooms, great staff, cold beer The rooms were they worst I've ever seen we were only staying 4 nights but certainly off putting. We were first placed in a room up narrow steps which were all tiled and I'm sure would be slippery when raining. Cats on a tiny balcony and a front door which if you pushed looked like it would open even if was locked!We asked to move which they did happily to another room. You couldnt shut the bathroom door. They were extremely basic. I have to say they were clean. There is no safe in the room and I was worried about the rough looking wooden safes at reception but nothing went missing. The staff were always friendly.Location wise it was it was great 2 minutes walk to the beach. The cheapest beer in town. We couldnt stomach the breakfast and never swam in the pool which you see from the street. They have a band at night which werent too bad so for that part with the cheap drinks it was ok.I guess it may be fine for guys roughing but would never stay there again.", "Date": "Mar 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR140236152", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u93c8\ue104\u3048\u9287\u3125\u57be\u6901\u3123\u4f00\u9352\u55d0\u4eb1\u9288\u5c7b\u4ef8\u9287\u52e9\u4f28\u9287\u6b0d\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(21744573, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR313162167", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\ue0fe\u5056\u9289\uff43\u5142\u951d\u30e3\u5147\u9288\uff43\u5138\u9289\u51a6\u5062\u9287\u3123\u511e\u9289\u7b3a\u510a\u9287\u3123\u4ef9\u9287\ue21e\u6d38\u5a09\u30e3\u4f04\u5bb8?   showReview(19913675, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR105039488", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297694-d588410-r22491847-Legian_Village_Hotel-Denpasar_Bali.html", "HotelID": "588410", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
