{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not bad, but less than we expected It was in a very good location. Walking distance to the Kurfurstendam Strasse, the Zoo, and the Brandenburg Tor. Also close to a S-bahn stop, and best of all, a STARBUCKS. The lobby (just a hallway with a check in desk) smelled BAD, but the rooms did not, even though our room was right across from the desk. The sleeping area was very large and clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was a bit moldy, there were no counters and the shower leaked on the floor, but I could stand it for a couple of nights ... and I am VERY picky. breakfast was typical European, but plentyful.", "Date": "Jun 11, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR550448818", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234912-r2182293-City_Hotel_Westerland-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "234912", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
