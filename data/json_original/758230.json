In the morning you can watch the market vendors set up and then go down and pick up some fresh fruit, cheeses or spices. Then it transforms at night into a local Rome hotspot. It is also a few blocks from Piazza Navona and the Pantheon. Its centrally located inbetween Vatican city and Ancient Rome. There are restaurants galore and shopping nearby. It has its quirks like the bed is very firm but apparently after talking to other tourists that's the norm. At night, the locals hang out nearby and some people complain but I didn't hear much.

We took a taxi from the airport and when we arrived they told us we were not booked for that location. Apparently they have several of them. They covered the cost of the roughly ten minute taxi ride and explained that when we make reservations online, those companies do not give them contact information so they are unable to advise travelers which location they are booked at. The location we stayed at is convenient. It is across from Castel Sant'Angelo and close to other touristic attractions like the Colosseo and Vatican. Our room consisted of a double bed, which was not two twin beds put together, had a safe, a nice restroom but the room was a bit small. It was clean, no complaints about that. Paula, the girl who works at this location was helpful when she was there. She is there until about 3pm and after that there is no one from the hotel to assist you. At least in that location. This location does have an elevator. The main location does not. The last night we were unable to get the AC going in our room and had to sleep with the windows open but it was not hot. The next morning they explained that the AC will not work if you do not shut the windows all the way. Which I'm guessing that's what happened. We checked out on Sunday morning but had a few more hours until our train left for Venice so we thought we could leave our luggage with the hotel while we roamed the city.

To save a few pennies for icecream etc we decided on this one but it certainly didn't feel like the 'economy' option once we were there. It is centrally located and even with a 16m old, walking to Piazza Navonna, The Pantheon, The Vatican and The Colosseum (in distance order) was pleasant and no problem. To be able to visit the Campo de'Fiori and Piazza Navonna at the drop of a hat was a real treat. I am actually a fan of the Metro as it always seems so much simpler than the Roman bus system but this area is about as far away from the nearest Metro as you can be in central Rome - so you might need to brave the buses if you're not walkers!

This area is full of restaurants, bars and street players and buskers; it is a lively, fun and (relatively) young area of the city. It is within walking distance of pretty much anywhere in the centre of Rome ... Piazza Navona 5 mins, Pantheon 7 mins, Collisseum 15 mins, Vatican 25-30 mins, Via Corsa (main shopping street) 10 mins. That said, if you like really quiet locations this hotel is probably not for you, nor if you have a disability or problems with stairs!

Before we arrived, I was a bit concerned that reception wasn't open at night, but it wasn't a problem. The rooms are rustic style, but comfortable, large and clean. Modern ensuite bathroom. There is free internet in the rooms. The staff was friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was simple, but tasty. There were always fresh pastries and some sort of cake/pie. There are windy stairs both to the rooms and the breakfast, so this is not the place for those with reduced mobility. The best thing is the location. It can be a little tricky to find, because it's a little hidden away in a small square, in the corner of a lovely bigger square. In the morning there is a fresh food market there. This area isn't just for tourists, except for the restaurants in the bigger square- pricey and mainstream. It's very central, we walked everywhere from here. The Vatican, Colosseum, the Spanish steps and so on. There are bus stops and taxi stands about 200 m from the hotel as well though. There is a supermarket quite close by- ask the hotel staff to mark it on the free map you get in the hotel. There is a nice pizzeria just by the door to the hotel, and it is worth looking around to find the reasonably priced restaurants that the locals go to. We ate in the Jewish quarters a few times, and also in a great place around the corner from the hotel. Tables outside, lots of locals, tasty food, friendly staff and good value wine. It's really worth it exploring Rome by foot- go down the smaller streets, they are very quiet even at the height of summer. A lot of tourists just go the quickest route from sight to sight, so those streets can be crammed, but one street over virtually empty.

A very unwelcoming man arrived and let us in without much communication. After a lengthy wait, he showed us to our room. Much more basic than I had been expecting, but clean enough. We had a lovely walk followed by dinner near the Piazza Navonna and themn returned back to the hotel, exhausted from travelling and ready to have a good night's sleep. Well if only we were allowed! Our room was directly about the Bar/Club below and the thumping music played until the early hours. Once that stopped, we discovererd that there was the constant sound of running water from the bathroom - it was like the toilet cistern would never come to a stop. We did not sleep at all. In the morning, we spoke to a lady at reception. She was in total denial of any of our issues - the bar and the running water. She was so rude and obnoxious to us. She refused to listen to the water problem (it was still running in the morning!). She also said that she would not be able to move us to another room. When I said that we would be checking out immediately, she tried to charge us for a full 3 nights. There was no chance of her getting any more than one dreadful night's worth (EUR 135!). We walked acorss the square and booked into the Hotel Campo De Fiori for a quite wonderful stay. I never heard a single word of apology from the Campo de Fiori afterwards.

The hotel is right on the campo di fiori which is a lovely square which has a market and comes alive at night with bars a resturants. Friday and Saturday nights are really busy. The campo is nosy (people not traffic) but we didn't find the hotel nosy at all and we were on the front. Its great to watch all the actvity from the window. The hotel is typically Italian. There is no lift but the spiral staircase is lovely and you feel more like you are staying in an apartment than a hotel. The rooms are lovely - flat screen TV, gorgeous shower, mini bar. The rooms are cleaned daily and are immaculate. The only complant was that the bed was very hard, however we still slept well. The breakfast is continental and was perfectly adequate except that there wasn't enough decent bread. It was nothing to get excited about and was the kind of food you get at a pensione rather than a hotel. The reception speak English if you need that. We only saw them once. Thankfully we didn't need them until the last night when we wanted them to order us a taxi but we couldn't find anyone. In the end we went over to the Hotel Campo de Fiori and they ordered one for us. There is however a taxi rank about a 5 minute walk away - go to the main road and turn right and keep walking to find it.
