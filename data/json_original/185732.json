Bad: room smelled awful, like a mix of old smoke and whatever was used to cover it up. Ugly: old furniture, institutional concrete balcony that overlooked a parking lot, had to step over drop cloths, painting and construction items in the fourth floor hallway when checking in. I stay regularly in Montreal; up to now it has been at the Hilton Garden Inn or The Delta. I decided to stay closer to the apartment of the people I was visiting this time. The price was comparable to HGI, but the place is beat. It wasn't \"ooh, run away\" nasty, but it wasn't what I expected for the price. I thought the bed was comfortable, but my traveling companion reported too hard. The location to restaurants and night life was great, but I eat at 7 and go to bed by 11, so not a personal draw. The lobby of the hotel is charmingly old fashioned, but with a casino air about it - not sophisticated at all, more like party central, which is great if that's what you want. The smell of the room was the number one worst thing. It actually made me ill. I woke up at 3AM with a sore throat as a result. The halls get noisy around 3 when the bars close, but the noise from below is not any worse than any other city hotel. The staff was very polite and friendly, but I won't go back unless I hear that the obviously in progress renovation has replaced the smelly furniture, carpet, and wall paper, cleaned the ventilation system, and will result in truly non-smoking rooms/floors.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lloydminster, SK", "Title": "\u201cwould stay again\u201d", "Author": "A_Dark_Canuck", "ReviewID": "UR126919143", "Content": "great experience staying here-friendly staff, nice rooms, nice view of the city and a perfect location downtown", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morgan, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cour new place to stay in Montreal\u201d", "Author": "EdVT", "ReviewID": "UR126770696", "Content": "We spent 2 nights in town for Cirque du Soleil and the Habs-Sens game March 22nd and 23rd.

When we returned back to our room in the evening, we had settled in for the night when very loud club music (I'm talking thumping bass) started to vibrate through our room. Where was this music coming from? There was a holiday party going in RIGHT UNDERNEATH our room. Literally, we could see the party below us from our balcony. Why would anyone be checked into this room when the hotel knew there was a party that night? When we called the front desk, the snotty person (I'm sorry to say this, but that's the best description I can offer) at the front desk offered us another room, or as compensation, told us the party would be over at 1:30AM (so no big deal, apparently!) We had already unpacked, were in our pjs, so we didn't want to move. But, as if on cue, the dj must have turned the volume UP as soon as we hung up with the front desk. Nope, there was no way we would be able to sleep through that noise, so we went downstairs, got the room key for another room on the 10th floor, and re-packed all our stuff, and trudged upstairs. As compensation, the front desk offered free breakfast. Are you kidding? I asked to speak to the manager, but she wasn't on call for the evening, however, the snotty front desk person (yes, the same girl) offered to leave a note for her manager. Ok. Next day, I went to the front desk to inquire as to what the manager's resolution to this would be. Same snotty front desk girl told me that the manager wasn't in, and that I should speak to her this morning, and that she would be here by 9AM (when I told her I'd be checking out.) Low and behold, when checking out this morning, the manager isn't there. So I left my phone #, and was assured I would be contacted by Tina --, the manager, once she got to work. By 5PM, I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard back, so I called the hotel and left another message. Tina called shortly after, and asked me how she could help me, as if she had no idea why I was calling. After she explained to me that the reason why the hotel put us in a room on the fourth floor was because we changed our reservation and requested two beds vs. the single king we had been assigned. Her explanation was essentially to blame us. She actually asked me what I wanted as compensation! Then, she proceeded to explain that since we had not been charged for the second bed (which we were not advised of until that moment), really, what else was I expecting? I found her attitude unhelpful, unapologetic, and frankly, gave me no reason to ever want to return to this hotel.

There's also a bar/restaurant in the lobby called Thursdays that turns into a nightclubby sort of thing at night. It also gets very loud, but I couldn't hear the noise in my room, 809.

The conference I attended was not in the hotel, so I got a good nightly rate that was cheaper than the conference hotel, which was the main reason I booked here. The room was spacious with lots of furniture and a huge balcony. My room had a flat screen tv, but my coworkers who were in similar rooms still had the old vacuum tube tvs in the huge armoires. I guess I would have gloated about my tv to my co-workers, had the remote control worked. The view wasn't great, neither was the temperature controls.

I was advised that would cost additional twenty-five dollars, - as if a bathtub was an upgrade! On principle I would not pay extra, and as there is no Duty Manager or Manager on duty Sunday (!?) - the hotel clerk opted to satisfy me by downgrading me to an unrenovated regular room which all have bath and showers. This room is fifty dollars less/night on-line, but they would not rebate any money or credit me for the downgrade. The toilet in the room was weak barely functional and when i enquired as to being moved was told by management that they'd send a maintenance man to dismantle and repair the toilet while i was trying to work but they would not, could not move me to another room, though the hotel was 50% capacity. Upon check out, I had a word with the Manager who was unsympathetic; would not rebate money, not offer discount on future stay or apologize for my inconvenience.

It was the long weekend and the hotel was bustling with people. We were cordially welcomed by Judith at reservations. Words alone cannot express the wonderful stay we had at the hotel. Our room was spacious, clean and the beds were so comfortable we didn't want to leave! Often, having comfortable pillows can be a problem, but not here. We all agreed we had restful sleeps, and that was a consensus of 4 ladies! The staff was cheerful, and always greeted us. Alain helped us with our baggage and provided suggestions on places to eat. Daniel helped us with our baggage when we checked out; he was very delightful. The doorman, please excuse as I forgot his name, helped load the baggage into our vehicle. He too was attentive and friendly. Anna, at reservations helped us with questions and assistance with our room needs. Our experience at the hotel made quite an impression with all of us. The breakfasts and brunch were so delicious and the selection plentiful. The only problem was it was so good that I may have put on a few pounds on! We enjoyed the rooftop bar the first night it opened for the season. It has a fantastic view of the cityscape. It has a great social atmosphere, and the people are friendly. Since the roof top bar is open to the public, hotel staff was able to keep the elevators organized and orderly while handling the volume of people. We all agreed we had a wonderful stay at Hotel de la Montagne and it would be our first place of preference to stay in Montreal. We look forward to returning soon! We had so much fun at the hotel; we missed a few of the places we wanted to see. Oh well, now that is a reason to return! Thanks to all the staff for making this a great vacation for all of us, and especially for making it an amazing time for my sister. Be sure to reserve this hotel in advance, as it fills up, especially on holiday weekends, due to its popularity and ideal central location", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Experience\u201d", "Author": "slash182", "ReviewID": "UR116963195", "Content": "What an amazing experience.

Only one room was left and we lucked out because it was a very nice one. Standard one queen bed room. Bed was very comfortable, bathroom was all in bianca carrera marble, large and clean. We enjoyed a few drinks at the rooftop bar by the pool. Very nice on a summer night. When you stay here you have free access to the large night club (can't remember the name) that is connected to it on Crescent st. We enjoyed dancing there as well. Valet Parking was $20, which is average in Montreal. Service was great from the parking attendant, to the front desk, bar staff, waiters, doorman, etc. The only bad thing was that our room was noisy as it was directly under the rooftop patio on the 19th floor.

First time to get a package since our honeymoon, but It was just a little more expensive than paying for just the airfare alone. The package included airfare on Jazz (Air Canada, gives points on United) and didn't have to pay extra for luggage. All of the staff at our hotel, Hotel de la Montagne, were extremely helpful. One night when we were asking the conceirge for advice on Portuguese restaurant, they pulled out the Portuguese manager for even more expert advice, she not only told us her favorite, but, called ahead and made reservations for us giving her name. The room was nonsmoking, clean and quiet, and huge with king size bed, balcony. If you are horribly allergic to smoke, you should note that there was one of those standing sand canisters for smokers to stub out their cigarettes right at the elevator on our floor. We never saw a cigarette there, but, it made me wonder whether all of the hotel is nonsmoking--worth asking. Bathroom was all tiled with separate shower and bathtub and two sinks. The room had a desk, sofa, easy chair, dining table and two chairs. It feels luxurious to spread out. And we got turndown service with delicious chocolates at night. A very nice touch is that the hotel lends umbrellas for free to hotel desks. The free wifi worked great. The hotel is just a few short blocks from the metro, and the 747 bus stop. Save yourself some money and buy a 1 day, 3 day or week public transportation pass at the international currency exchange office immediately after you exit airport customs and luggage pickup. Downside for us old fogies is that the pool bar was mainly a bar in pm and evening with outside folks coming in--which moved into the lobby bar when raining. The bar/pool area was closed several days because of the rain. Outside guests are allowed in after 11 am. One night, some mischief makers moved pictures on the walls from one floor to another. We had asked for a quiet room in advance so they had situated us far away from the pool bar, but, it is a little disconcerting to think of non-hotel guests roaming the hallways. There is a dress code for the pool bar. We never ate at the hotel since the hotel bar/restaurant area in the lobby seemed awfully dark, we weren't interested in bar food, and the menu prices on display near the elevators seemed pricey. Nearby are Cafe Cora, Cafe Vasco de Gama etc. for breakfast. From the hotel, you can easily walk to shops, Museum of Fine Arts (Soup Soupe nearby for salad, sandwich or soup), good restaurants (highly recommend Kazu), or metro to other good options for dinner (e.g., Au Petit Extra near fireworks, Chez Doval for Portuguese, L'Express) or adventure out (e.g, Jean Talon Market--go hungry and plan to eat there or pick up picnic stuff, recommend nearby Le Petit Alep for Syrian food).

When we arrived to check in, we were advised that along with the room being pre-paid, we were told that the hotel also needed to charge an additional $200.00 to the card or take $500.00 cash as a security deposit. This again was the very first time we have encountered anything like this. Over the past 10 years, we have stayed at approx 1500 hotels all around the world and this was definitely a first for us. Upon speaking with the staff who was on duty that night, they stated that this was policy and no way around it. I advised her that I understood that this was policy but there needed to be a way to rectify this issue due to the fact that this was never addressed upon booking. We were then told that since it was booked through Orbitz, they were not in control of what went on there. When we asked if there was a manager on duty, the employee stated no and that we would have to contact her tomorrow if we had any further questions. When we explained the situation to her, which she appeared to no longer understand us or care and further advised us that a refund was not possible. I decided to place the security deposit on my card and we were then given the keys to the room. We were then told that the car would be placed in the parking garage and would be available at anytime. We then retrieved our luggage and other items from the car, without any assistance or even being asked for help, from any staff member of the hotel. We both had several bags in which we had to make several trips to get. The next night, we had dinner reservations and when we asked if we could get our vehicle, we were told to give the ticket to the doorman, which was no where to be found. Finally after several minutes of searching and asking the main desk, he arrived and called down to the parking garage. He got off the phone and advised us that the person there was not answering and appeared to be either on break or simply not around. He was then going to turn around and walk away without any further assistance. When we advised him that we needed out car for reservations, we brought us down to the parking garage where we did find a male subject in the booth. We then got our own vehicle and exited the garage. The entire staff was rude and did not seem to care that we were experiencing such a horrible service here. When we arrived later that night, we parked the car in front of the parking garage door and honked our horn and waited for about 10 minutes. We then walked in, again with no doorman around, and advised them that we were trying to park our car back in the garage. They told us to leave the key and that they would take care of it. Upon checking out, we were advised that our room had been charged $1.25 plus taxes for the LOCAL CALLS that were made, which this was really ob-sured and wrong in itself. NO hotel ever has ever charged for local calls. Once again, this was at no time explained to us and there was no sign or literature to show such would be charged. I had questioned family and friends who live in Montreal and they have never heard of such horrible service/policies and understood why we were upset about the whole thing, which ruined our entire stay in Montreal from beginning to end. Needless to say, this will be the last time that I along with anyone else I know will be staying at your hotel. Which is too bad since it does appear to be a very nice hotel with a great location. Again, with all the times I have been in Montreal, this was the first time I have ever experienced such rude, could care less attitude from any staff, which is crazy since customer service usually is and should be top priority in the hotel industry.

The airconditioning unit was replaced by the time we had our breakfast. The hotel has a swimming pool, located on top of the roof of the hotel. The view is great and you could eat and drink there as well. However, when we went to the pool at around 6 pm, there was loud music playing and the place was so crowded that we had nowhere to sit. It seemed like a great party place, with mostly adults who were drinking and enjoying to hang out, but my son felt uncomfortable and so we left.

We reserved a room for four nights with two queen sized beds and balcony at a rate of 209 Can Dollars a night plus tax. More than we would usually pay but on the basis of good Tripadvisor reviews and a personal recommendation, we decided to treat ourselves. We arrived at hotel to check in. Receptionist advised with pragmatic indifference that our Mastercard had been declined. We were horrified because we knew we had more than adequate credit. The hotel then demanded from us 700 dollars cash to enable us to be accommodated. We did not have this sum in cash and the amount requested was quickly reduced to 244 dollars - the cost of one night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay - but, we were warned, we could not have the key to the minibar and any other service would have to be paid in cash in advance. We are both in our sixties \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were they concerned that we might thrash the room? We were allocated a room on the 19th floor with old fashioned brown and cream striped wallpaper, pictures of hunting scenes, a horribly dated brown swirly patterned carpet all dominated by an enormous gothic cabinet containing a big old fashioned television. Private balcony was truly awful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stained bare concrete walls and cracked blocks. (see photo). Our room was very unlike the attractive modern rooms on hotel website. Spent anxious sleepless night worrying but reassured the following morning following an expensive international call to our bank, that our credit balance was fine and that the difficulty appeared to be with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swipe system. We returned to Reception. The card was swiped again and approved!! Absolutely no concern or sympathy from the staff member as to how this might have happened. We expressed disappointment with room and this was greeted with total disinterest. We asked if there might be a room available similar to those on website and brochure.. After checking,, receptionist advised that she could move us but at an additional cost of 40 dollars a night plus tax! It appears that some floors have been renovated and may very well look as good as they do on the website but our experience was quite different. We stayed for four nights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on each day the key card to our room was de-activated and each time we had to return to the reception desk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c never once was there an apology.

Over all had a good experience our first time with this hotel. We stayed in two \"Classic\" rooms. Important to note that on websites like expedia, rooms that are Classic are the (unrenovated?) rooms with old school charm (which we loved). No photos of these rooms are available on the actual hotel website. The hotel website only shows their Contemporary rooms (updated, very modern, posh rooms). Positives: Amazing location, steps away from St. Catherines, Crescent St bars just behind the hotel, 5-7 min walk to I think 4 subway stops. Rooms are incredibly large and amazingly clean and beautifully prepared. Bathrooms are extremely clean and spacious and luxurious. Lots of great restaurants in the area as well as major chain-type restaurants also available too. SAQ liquor store just around the corner. Service was very good: the front desk staff were pleasant to us, the concierge showed us the facilities and accompanied us up to the room to show us the amenities etc. Very nice old school good service to the wonderful old school charm of the decor and the hotel. Negatives: Pool on the rooftop is really a rooftop bar open to the public. This is a hotspot for locals. Which unfortunately makes the pool completely inaccessible to guests of the hotel (absolutely no poolside space for reserved for guests only). They reserve the pool between 9am-11am for guests, but after 11am it's a free for all. As well, everytime we used the elevator during our 4 day stay, there are many many non-hotel guests in the lobby, crammed in elevators, trying to get up to the rooftop bar. With your hotel card, you get priority in the line up going up, but coming down from your suite is difficult given all the people already crammed in the elevator coming down from the rooftop. We had to split up our group between 3 elevator rides just to get down. Another small negative: A/C is extremely loud at night. Also loud: we stayed on the 16th floor, facing Crescent, and could hear the bars late into the night (even coming home after we were out late). Most of us were deep sleepers, so it didn't matter too much to us. But if you are a light sleeper, request a room facing the other side. Final negative: while checking out, we saw an interaction between another hotel guest and a staff of the management at the front desk. We were not involved, but to be honest, the interaction frightened us a little. The guest wanted to talk to management about picking up his car from the valet, only to find a door ding/dent in his driver side. When he asked about who to talk to, the staff person basically said it was impossible that it happened while his vehicle was in the care of the premises. And she accused the patron of damaging his own car and then blaming the hotel. Wow! We were all extremely unimpressed by this.... yikes! We were glad we didn't have any problems up until then.

The staff very friendly and helpful and the rooms are big and clean (at least by UK standards). The website for the Hotel suggests a quiet ambience but its position in the centre of town and proximity to powerful air conditioning units on the side of the building means that it is quite a noisy location although that did not bother me. Rue Saint Catherine is the main shopping drag in Montreal and the hotel is also close (5 mins) to the underground shops on St Catherine, Bell Centre, Concordia University and Mount Royal (its also close to the metro). The Hotel has a frendly bar on the bottom floor (great for watching the Ice Hockey) and a club attached. On the downside only the first coffee of the day is covered by the minibar all other drinks need to be paid for (I just bought some tea and coffee and made them in my room). I think a lot of people would like to visit Montreal as a francophone city in North America and it does combine the best of Europe and North America. One can get by without French but for me it was a great place to practice and brush up. Hotel de Montagne is well sited and is about 30mins walk from vieux montreal. I rented a car for the week and to be honest that was a mistake as Montreal is very walkable and apart from a trip across the border to Vermont and some quick trips I didn't need one (but it did mean that I was worried about keeping the parking up too date - $ 15.00/day in the lot next to the hotel). Montreal is easy enough to drive around though and although nervous as a UK car driver I didn't find it too hard. Checkout is at 12.00 (which was a bot of a pain as my flight didn't leave until the evening). No hassles with the bill except that they had though I had used the hotel parking for the week which would have been pricey (luckily I kept my tabs from the parking next door).

I had read other reviews on tripadvisor from individuals mentioning these rooms were low quality, and I really didn't want that for my friends and I. When I got to the front desk to check in I asked if there were any available upgrades, to which the woman behind the counter said 'no' immediately. I was surprised because the weekend my friends and I decided to come (on our college reading week) was before the high school spring break and after the university spring break, so it seemed unlikely that the hotel would be completely booked and unable to upgrade us at some point in four days we would be there. I asked again about the upgrade and the woman said kind of rudely 'well you already have 2 doubles, what do you want?' to which I responded 'yes, a standard room with 2 doubles - is there not something nicer?' she looked and found an upgrade to a contemporary room with 2 doubles for 40 dollars addtional a night. We took it. Sidenote: The hotel lobby was the tackiest lobby I'd ever seen. Incidentals were $400 dollars for the 4 night stay. Parking was 18 dollars + taxes a night for underground (if you drive a car, it's more expensive for an SUV). There were 2 public lots right beside the hotel that offered 8 dollar parking, I wish I had just used that instead. The hotel offers complimentary high-quality WiFi, which I've never had at any other hotel. It was a really nice touch that all 3 of us appreciated. The room was really nice, great lighting set up, flat screen television, private balcony (every hotel room has a balcony) and spacious enough for 3 girls and all their stuff. The bathroom was large with two sinks, a shower, and seperate tub. Sidenote: I'm not sure if this goes beyond the hotel or not - but the shower water is 'hard-water' and coming from a city with much, much softer water - my hair was like straw after my first shower (pack good quality shampoo and conditioner and a spray-conditioner - even with all three of those products my hair was still really dry). My friends also encountered the same problem. There is a mini fridge but it is packed with typical mini bar items, which was annoying since we needed a fridge. The gentleman who brought our bags up to the room told us to keep everything on the balcony, calling it our 'natural fridge'. We did and it kind of worked, but I still would have prefered space in the fridge. Not being able to speak a lick of french wasn't an issue communication-wise for the most part (though hotel staff often seemed annoyed with the fact we didn't know any french), but the turn-down service employees could not understand us at all. At one point in our stay we needed more towels and it took 15 minutes for someone to come up, and when she did she wanted to clean the entire room (it was 2:45pm at this point). We kept asking her to come back later and just leave the towels, but she didn't understand. Eventually a manager type came up to speak with us thinking that there was an issue. But she could barely understand us. We were told turn down ended at 4pm and this was the last time she would be available to clean our room, so they came in and quickly straightened up while we did school work on our laptops. This hotel's main selling point is the location. It is literally situated in the ideal place for 20-somethings. Urban Outfitters, French Connection, Betsey Johnson, Forever 21, and other great stores are merely minutes away. The liquor store (SAQ) is also extremely close as are several mini marts. Of course, the dining experience in Montreal is comparably to none and the restaurants that were around the hotel were all excellent. There are several nightlife choices as well. We realize now that the trip is over that we made one large error - asking the hotel about clubs and bars. If we had just googled the clubs and bars ourselves, we would have found what we were looking for. The hotel staff had no idea what the recommend to us, even after we attempted to explain countless times. Asking the locals was no help either. Oh, and on Sunday's if you are looking to go out - plan ahead. So few bars/clubs stay open on Sunday in the winter season that it was impossible to find some place to go. The hotel also had a hard time recommending places to eat to us - which was a first for me. Most hotels I've stayed at are buzzing with information, but the staff here couldn't have been less helpful. We just ended up wandering around and finding them ourselves (Try Pino or Lacadamie - both delicious and within a minute of the hotel). Hotel de la Montagne offers a club/bar right in the hotel - but the age demographic for both were clearly older than us. 'Th Club' was more funny than fun with the rotating dancefloor and 'Thursdays' was basically a pub which was not my friends and I scene. There is also a piano bar, but we didn't spend any time in there. Bars/Clubs outside of the hotel that we went to included Seven (hip hop/r&b bar), Radio Lounge (very young dance bar), Rouge (older crowd, mix of new and classic music), and on the last night we went to Pang Pang Karaoke Bar and rented a private karaoke room (you must go, it was really cheap and a lot of fun). We never got to go to Ultra, but we wish we had. At some point while we were out on Sunday night, I lost both my debit and credit card and they are for a branch that wasn't easily accessable in Montreal. When I spoke to the hotel staff for assistance, they were all very insensitive to the issue (I was 7 hours away from home with ZERO cash and just needed help - not attitude). My friends and I truly believe we were treated unfairly due to our age (and they often seemed annoyed we didn't speak french) and felt the treatment by the staff was often blatantly rude. We were on vacation, we didn't need to be spoke down to or treated so unfairly by the staff. We were so surprised by this turn of events with the staff too, since most reviews always highlight how helpful the hotel's people were. This hotel staff just did not seem to want us there and that's a terrible way to make paying customers feel.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville", "Title": "\u201cOld world charm\u201d", "Author": "TripleDDDNashville", "ReviewID": "UR56041797", "Content": "This small hotel takes you back in time to another era.

What they gave us was a dated room that hadn't been renovated since the 80's. Don't get me wrong, the room was huge and so was the bathroom but was very outdated. I sort of felt like it was a \"bait and switch\". After asking to be put in one of their updated rooms they told me it was an additional $40 per night, per room. I really didn't make a stink about it, but I should. They're website is very misleading and shows you pictures of only their updated rooms. They should really differentiate both rooms on their website and not MISLEAD people, so just beware before booking.

If location is your main goal this hotel is the way to go. It is on the opposite side of Cresent St, which is the hub bub of partying. Close to shopping, shopping and more shopping. Metro is very close. 3 blocks I believe, and no matter which metro stop you get on, its easy to transfer to others. Hotel staff was amazingly nice. Held doors each and every time we entered or exited the hotel. When we pulled up to the hotel doorman took our luggage, escorted us into lobby and another bellmen took us to our room carrying our luggage. Fast check-in. Explained how to get to wherever we wanted to go each and every time. Gave maps and marked areas of interest. Thursdays night club is attached to the hotel, right downstairs. Lounge area has a piano player and singer every nite. She sang till 12:30 -1 am the one night. Pretty good too. You can even order food from Thrusdays-small bar menu and get drinks. The drinks were the strongest and best. Rooms are quite large, very good shower pressure, large bathrooms, comfy beds. Now the negatives, Pool area is on the roof which when the weather is bad, it is not opened, and of course two of our days it was closed, though I don't think we would have used it anyway. The pool allows anyone to use it, it is not exclusive to guest only. There is a bar up there too, so not good for a quiet romantic swim, or for a family with kids. The view is nice though. Do not eat breakfast at the hotel. Go to eggspectations. Take a left out of the hotel, go up the street and there it is on the corner. Great service, good food and priced well. We also ate lunch there and husband said his garlic shrimp was the best shrimp he had ever eaten! Housekeeping never replaced the sugar my husband used on the first day and was afraid to ask for more as when I called for a bucket of ice, they said they would gladly send one up---for 3 dollars!! Yikes! When I booked the room I did ask for a 12th floor, new room overlooking Cresent st and what I got was an older room, 5th floor overlooking a very loud condenser on a roof. Horrible view. That condenser was so loud had to have the a/c on to drown out the loud noise. Balcony was small, would've been doable is there was a chair or two out there. Door for the balcony is in a very akward spot. Curtains don't really cover the window right and light comes peaking in in the early morning hours. Parking is 20 cdn, but paying for parking is the norm up there. Overall, I would use the hotel again. The staff is what made the hotel. Don't forget to try steamies ( a steamed hot dog, a steamed bun, loaded with mustard, relish, onions, cabbage and a load of fries- all for 5 dollars! the place we got our was on the corner by club soda, Dunns, eggspectations. Walk the clock tower to the top 192 steps, see a just for laughs comedy show, vist old montreal, old notre- dame, and if you go in the winter time their water parks become snow parks. So much fun.

The room was spotless and housekeeping did a very good job. The 6PM turn down service was a nice touch. The check in/checkout was smooth and the concierge was very helpful. The Thursday's bar was overhyped the crowd was alot older than expected but still there is much fun to be had right within 4 blocks of the hotel. The bartenders there were great. Bathrooms were huge also and had a shower and bathtub. For a fully booked hotel i didnt see many people in it. The lobby is very nice and welcoming. Parking is 16CAD plus 3 dollars tax which is very reasonable compared to hotels on the same street charging close to double. Please be aware that they WILL squeeze your luxury car into a overly tight space. The hotel manager is very very helpful.

The Room The hotel used to be an apartment building that was converted into a hotel. The result is that the rooms are much larger than you typically find in a hotel. Simply put, it is the largest hotel room I have ever stayed in. This is nice when you are visiting for several days and don't want to get that claustrophobic feeling. There is a real sense of space with room to move around. It has a bathroom with a bathtub and a separate room with a vanity and a shower. There is a balcony, which allows you to let in fresh air, hotels with sealed windows being a pet peeve of mine. The decor is very nice with top quality furniture. Nothing was dated or worn. Service The service is beyond what you would normally expect from a mid priced hotel. There is a doorman who is there to take your luggage when you arrive, not just to the front desk, but to your room after you check in. The gentleman who took mine was very friendly, telling me about the area and the hotel amenities on the way to my room. Whenever you enter or leave the hotel there is someone there opening the door for you. The rooms provide thick terry cloth bath robes, and every night at about six a lady goes to each room giving out chocolates, along with a card showing the weather forecast for the next day. Probably the best service I have ever gotten at a hotel. Location There is no better location from which to spend a few days in downtown Montreal. If you are there for the nightlife, the hotel is one street over from the section of Crescent Street where all the nightclubs are located. Close enough to walk in a couple minutes, but far enough so that you don't have to deal with the noise when you're in your room. It is half a block from St Catherine Street and about a 5 minute walk to the subway. The Belle Centre, Place Ville Marie and the Eaton Centre are all within about a 10 minute walk. Final thoughts It is the combined effect of all the little things that make this such a nice hotel to stay at. As a frequent traveller I have stayed at many hotels over the years. As a traveller of moderate means they are usually in the mid priced category. I have never stayed at a hotel where they do so much to make you feel pampered and appreciated. Most mid priced hotels feel like mid priced hotels. At Hotel de la Montagne I felt like I was enjoying the benefits of a luxury hotel without the price.

Two days later when I tried to retrieve my bikes the attendant said it would be $60. I told him the quoted price was $15/day. He mumbled something about the time in or time out. Frustrated I decided to give in and looked in my wallet for $60 cash. After finding that I didn't have the cash this guy walked me up to the cashier's office where he said something to the counter guy in French. The counter guy then proceeded to charge me $130! Yes, the price had doubled yet again. I screamed for a bit at the parking lot attendant and eventually turned over my credit card. This was a big mistake. I should have called the cops.

There's a lot of activity within the hotel & environs, too... when I checked in after midnight on a Thursday, I could barely hear what Reception was saying over the din in the Cabaret bar, and there was a long line of people headed to the Terrace Magnetique bar on the roof. I was pleased upon arrival at my room that I couldn't hear any of it from there (actually, the simple sounds of a city were more intrusive than the party atmosphere above and below). The halls were a little the worse for wear but the room itself was a good size and very clean and comfortable. Housekeeping did a great job and my interactions with reception were all positive. I couldn't get a feel for the doorman's hours (almost never seemed to be there). Had room service (chocolate mousse was very nice). The restaurant (serving breakfast buffet or ala carte, and lunch) was fine, prices reasonable, the staff very attentive. My advise for those interested in all the hubbub about the Terrace Magnetique would be to go up and have a drink with friends if you want - it's clearly a happening place to be for that purpose - but Please Do Not Eat There Under Any Circumstances. I popped up for a quick lunch one day just to get the atmosphere (and the view) and the caesar-salad-with-shrimp was simply horrid (both to see and taste). I still shudder at the memory.

The room was clean and lovely, cool marble bathroom tiles, a tub and shower, stocked mini bar and plenty of space to work (laptops come with on the trip).

Just one minor beef; we were asked kindly but often by the hotel staff (front desk, servers, door attendant, even a housekeeper) what brought us to Montreal. We answered each time that it was our first trip to the city and that we were there to celebrate our 6th Wedding Anniversary. After many congratulations and acknowledgements, I was surprised that the hotel made no additional gesture of our very special occasion.

No complaints though - we weren't carrying enough luggage to make their services necessary. Check-in was a friendly experience, and we found the service to be quite good throughout - except when we returned to the hotel around 10:00 p.m. dressed in our \"comfort clothes\", sneakers, and carrying a Mac's bag; we got a bit of a look from the front desk as if they thought we were in the wrong place. My partner and I had a king deluxe room - very large and spacious, and the bathroom was lovely for the most part. One wonders why, however, when the hotel went to the bother of tiling the floor and walls with marble, they would put cheap white tiles in the shower stall and install a pressboard vanity counter. The full-length mirror was very nice, and we certainly appreciated the 2 sinks in the bathroom. Word to the wise, though: make sure your room is located on at least the 8th floor if they're putting you at the back of the building. We were on the 5th floor and we could hardly hear ourselves talk over the roar of vents, air conditioners, etc. while trying to use the balcony. The back of the building overlooks a rather dingy industrial scene, and I think being on a higher floor would help. We wondered if, because we had booked with Expedia, we had been given a \"money savers\" room instead of one of their better ones. Or if you don't mind street noise and enjoy people-watching, ask for a room at the front of the building. The mini bar was well-stocked, the bed was comfortable, and the location was excellent. The air conditioner could have worked better, and chairs on the balcony would have been helpful, but all-in-all it was a good stay and we will likely return.", "Date": "September 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay ... but don't expect to use the pool!!\u201d", "Author": "family_voyager_7", "ReviewID": "UR8274978", "Content": "My wife and I decided to visit Montr\u00c3\u00a9al this summer with our children. I have always stayed downtown at other business hotels, but this time I was looking for something with a bit more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153character\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the children might appreciate. I did a fair bit of research on the internet and decided on l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Montagne. Definitely one of the most attractive features of the hotel was the rooftop pool, which is a must when travelling with children. It seems now that I didn't do enough research, based on our experience this past week. The hotel is nicely situated in the best part of downtown Montreal and the hotel is very comfortable and their staff was very friendly and well mannered. The facilities are very well appointed and our standard room was quite large - this is one of the very few downtown hotels that offer queen-sized beds. But I certainly had quite a bit of concern with their swimming pool. Their website provides an image of a quiet and relaxed pool setting that describes the scene as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hidden oasis high above the city \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a dream spot in the heart of downtown for sunbathing around the pool, having a drink and a light meal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Their video reinforces this concept with a woman diving into a calm, clear pool as a few other guests serenely watch from the terrace. In reality, we found a much different scene when we arrived at the pool at 2:30 P.M., after a sun-filled morning of touring the city and looking for some quiet relaxation and cool down. What we found was quite simply shocking. The pool deck was crowded almost beyond capacity, and not a single chair was available to us. The vast majority of this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clientele\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were quite obviously not guests of the hotel. Most were early twenty-somethings wearing skimpy bathing suits and covered in tattoos. It was as if we had walked into a scene from a spring break party at Fort Lauderdale! We were not alone in our reaction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another young family with a baby arrived shortly after us with a look that showed that they were even more taken aback than we were. From the brief conversation we had with them we learned that they were under the same false impression as we had about the access and use of the pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that being for hotel guests only. It is definitely not. Anyone who buys a drink is welcome, and seems to have priority over hotel guests. The crowd was quite obviously uninterested in using the pool for swimming. Apart from the full deck, there was an equally large number of people seated around and/or standing in the water around the edge the edge of the pool. Practically everyone had a beer or cocktail glass (definitely a safety issue around a pool, I might add!), and a fair number were smoking cigarettes, some even while they were in the pool. For a young family, this was quite shocking and quite unacceptable. It was quite obvious that this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clientele\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were not guests of the hotel. I counted only five (5) people on the pool deck that I could assume were guests, given that they had hotel towels with them (since none were being provided to guests - despite the contrary statement on their website). We were not the only guests obviously frustrated by the experience. One poor man was trying to do laps, but was having a very difficult time \u00e2\u20ac\u0153navigating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd amongst the partiers and gave up after only a few ends. Another woman was trying to find some sun and a place to read her book, but after being bumped and crawled-over by the crowd one-too-many times, she too gave up and left. For our part, my two daughters (aged 6) wanted to cool off a bit, so we \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coaxed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd an opening onto the shallow end wall to allow them access to the pool. Being children, they splashed a bit as they tried to swim in the open area of the shallow end. This was obviously not appreciated by the people standing around the edge of the pool who were trying to maintain their hair, makeup and bikinis in pristine condition as well as find the chance to pickup a date for the evening. After a few minutes, we also simply gave up and left the pool area completely, quite disappointed and frustrated. This would be a great hotel for singles and young marrieds without kids who don't mind serious crowds and want the \"eye-candy\" but certainly not a place for the rest of us. A definite disappointment for us and we will not be returning anytime soon.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Astoria, New York", "Title": "\u201cClean, HUGE rooms.

The furnishings were not shiny/sleek/modern, but everything was in good shape and, overall, we felt very at home there. The concierge was helpful and also let us know for next time that he often has discount tickets available for shows around town. Our only complaint was with the rooftop pool/bar. The pool is open to the public, and they certainly take advantage. We went up at about 5PM, hoping to take a quick dip and sun ourselves, only to find a space PACKED with young people. Great if you are single and interested in partying and drinking with beautiful people. Not so great if you're looking for a quiet hour in the sun with a fruity drink and a book. There wasn't an available chair to be seen in the small pool area. I wish that they would perhaps institute a \"hotel guests only\" period for a few hours every day since we would have liked to relax there for a while. The separate bar and terrasse are very nice for an outdoor drink and some light food. Every room has a balcony, which offers great nighttime views of the city--but our one question: why don't they put chairs out there for the guests? A lil' odd. As for location, the hotel is one block from Crescent--bars and restaurants, one block from St. Catherine--shopping GALORE (go to Simons for affordable and cute Quebec-made clothes), four blocks or so from the nearest Metro, two blocks or so from the Bell Center. Convenient enough spot for all your tourist needs. We were on the 12th floor, overlooking Crescent, so we weren't subjected to either the street noise, or the rooftop noise that some reviewers commented on. I would certainly return to the Hotel de la Montagne for my next trip. :) ***Word to the wise*** Do NOT take L'Aerobus (airport shuttle) back to the airport. We got on the shuttle at 3:30 for a 6PM flight. We informed them more than once what time our flight was. Our driver was dismissive: \"Yeah yeah, it'll be fine.\" She proceeded to drive down streets that even we, as tourists, knew were closed off. She made several stops and didn't even pick up any additional passengers. Because of L'Aerobus' inefficient and unreliable driver, we missed our flight and had to pay $40 each to get our tickets reissued. Even the ticket agent at Air Canada agreed that they're useless!

For some background, we have stayed at this hotel once before and liked it so much we went back. Regularly $189.00 night, we booked it on expedia.ca at $119.00 per night. It is a small and pretty hotel, full of character in a great location, and close to the Bell Centre, where we had tickets to a show. This was part of the reason we selected De la Montagne again. We had no trouble with valet parking ($17.00 overnight) or check in. All were done quickly and politely in English or French (everyone we interacted with at the hotel was bilingual). The breakfast buffet was excellent ($14.95 per person) and well presented - fresh fruit, pastries, croissants, cut fruit (melons, strawberries, peaches, etc.) and cottage cheese. On the hot food side, you had pancakes, hash browns, bacon, sausage or ham, and they also served scrambled eggs. They have a full range of dry cereal, juices and coffee too. You had a selection of English or French newspapers to read over breakfast. The service we received was good and courteous. Our Room: We had a Queen room which appeared to be clean and well appointed. Marble floors in the bathroom, robes, slippers as well as all the little toiletries. The main room was pretty, with a large closet, drawers, and safe. It also boasts a mini fridge, stocked with everything you could need when in the mood for a snack or drink (all $ extra). The room had a nice firm bed, fluffy duvet, and pillows. At night the hotel offers turn down service; complete with little chocolates and the next day's weather forecast. For those who like room, the King rooms are much larger (we had a king room on our prior visit in September 2005.) Background of our complaint and why I give the Hotel De la Montage a poor rating: We checked in, dropped our stuff in the room and literally went straight to the show at the nearby Bell Centre. We returned just after the concert ended at 11:00pm and prepared for bed. Turn down service was provided some time while we were out at the concert. Much to my dismay, upon sitting on the edge of the bed, we noticed an open & empty condom wrapper on the floor. Something neither my husband nor I noticed when we entered the room earlier in the evening. We immediately called the front desk to mention it. We were told to take up our complaint with the day manager, Ms. Rodriguez, in the morning when we checked out. We were told she would be there as of 7am and that our message would be relayed to her. When we checked out, at approximately 10am, we spoke with Ms. Rodriguez. She mentioned she had not received our message and that she had just arrived. I explained the thought of the hotel providing a turn down service in a lovely hotel, and then the eerie coincidence of the condom wrapper on the floor, was sickening. She said it was not acceptable but offered nothing to remedy the situation. No more than an \"I'm sorry, I will look into it.\" And interesting that she asked where the wrapper was at that moment - almost as if to imply we were making it up. So much for treating the customer as we expect to be treated. We were not looking for a free nights stay or anything of that nature, but something was due given the situation. Show a client some empathy - pay for our parking, offer a discount on our next stay, SOMETHING! Oversight/accident or not, this is unacceptable at a hotel of this level. We will no longer stay at this hotel as a direct result of this experience. We will try the Vogue directly across the street the next time. The reason we liked this hotel, and went back, was its great location to all things - you are right downtown, three blocks to the Bell Centre (home of the Montreal Canadiens), shopping one block over on St Catherine St. or the Louis Vuitton shop in Ogilvy's in the same block. I suggest using your judgement; no question it is a lovely looking hotel.
