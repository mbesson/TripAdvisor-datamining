I can only echo other reviewers in respect of the great location of the hotel if the purpose of your visit is to explore what Barcelona has to offer rather than rest in peace in your hotel room. We got a really great room rate from the Internet. However we did have a room on the first floor. There is no other way to put it other than the metro does disturb you with its rumbling! But to be honest I was more disturbed by the mini fridge noise after a few hours than the noise of the metro trains. It was a point of a giggle between me and my husband listening to the rumble of the trains. The room was compact but had everything we needed for the two of us including a safe, drawers, storage.The bathroom was a really good size with shower and bath. We went up to the rooftop and the views are really good, although we didn't use the jacuzzi as it does have an additional charge. The breakfast choice is what makes this hotel very good in my opinion. Hot choices, continental meats and cheeses, fresh juices, pastries, toast, yoghurt, fresh fruit and cereals are all available with a good selection. It's hard to feel hungry after breakfast. We did many activities, and can highly recommend a Segway tour to see much of the city, as well as making the most of all the Gaudi architecture. Being in the centre of the Gothic and the Born districts restaurants, bars and shops are all in easy reach, and the Ramblas is just a little over 5 mins walk away. If you can accept that hustle, bustle and noise are all part of a city break then this hotel is not a bad choice for a few nights making the most of the wonderful city of Barcelona.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "belfast", "Title": "\u201cLong Weekend 17/02/12 - 20/02/12\u201d", "Author": "Michellef", "ReviewID": "UR125502369", "Content": "Excellent service on arrival.

Most of the main attractions are, at most, 20 minutes walk away. There are numerous restaurants and bars withing 5 minutes walk from the Hotel. Upon arrival we were welcomed with a glass of champagne and very welcoming staff. However, although we had paid the extra for strawberries and cream upon arrival we were not aware that these would need to be collected from the bar and would not be brought to your room as most would expect. There was also no offer to take our bags to our room. This maybe pretty minor but with a bottle of champagne in one hand, strawberries in another it was difficult getting the bags upto the room. The room itself at first sight appeared nice though after a few minutes we noticed a few problems which once pointed out to reception were remedied quite quickly though i would expect to have a clean problem free room for the money we paid. However, they failed to fix the problem with the window in our room on the 4th floor which made it very noisy at night. It appeared as though the seal around thw window was no longer fully in tact with the frame. One of the selling point of the hotel was the roof top jacuzzi and bar. However don't be fooled. Upon reading the literature it states that the roof top bar is closed and that the jacuzzi needs to be booked from 2pm. When we tried to arrange this with reception we found out that the cost of doing this was 49 euros for 30 minutes. I felt this was steep, especially as we had paid almost \u00a380 extra for a better experience. We also planned on taking advantage of the 20% off for massages and other treatments. However, upon looking at the prices, the 20% discount would have made very little difference to what I would consider very expensive treatments. To end on a plus point the breakfast, which was included in the extra money was of good quality. Local pastries, fresh fruit and numerous dishes to suit everyones breakfast needs. Despite all the problems i would recomend this hotel purely based on its location though i would recomend that you do not book it on the basis of a nice relaxing soak in the roof top jacuzz. I would also recommend you do not pay the extra amount and just go for a basic room. I felt this hotel let itself down, its nice rooms and location over shadowed by its greedyness to charge for everything. I felt if the prices were more reasonable a lot more would make use of them and feel less ripped off!", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stevenage, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, well priced hotel in good location\u201d", "Author": "Tammy1catobe", "ReviewID": "UR124865299", "Content": "Just got back from a three night break with my partner and another couple. The hotel is ideally situated by the Jaume 1 metro station and you can't really miss it when you come up onto the street. We were greeted with a glass of Cava each and received a voucher for a free cocktail. The rooms, though small, were well equiped, modern and clean. We asked for a high up room to avoid the noise from the road and metro and were allocated a nice double room with a bath and shower on the seventh floor. Our friends were offered a slightly bigger room along the corridor but it was a twin room so they swapped for a double on the sixth floor and were not troubled by the noise. They only had a shower with no bath so it's worth asking for what you want if you are fussy about baths/showers etc. The staff are very helpful and gave excellent recommendations for restaurants and showed us where to find them on the map. The area is ideal, right by the cathedral and on the edge of the gothic area and Ribera area, where there are a large number of very good restuarants. We travelled from the airport by the RENFE train and metro which was easy and a bargain compared to UK travel prices. We bought a T10 ticket for \u20ac9.25 which got all four of us from the airport to the hotel and back again, with two journeys to spare! The rooftop terrace is a lovely place to watch the sun go down and it was warm enough for us to take our cocktails up, although the bar up there is not open in February. Excellent breakfast, included in the price we paid. Hot and cold buffet with loads of juices, fruit, meats and cheeses. We didn't need lunch after enjoying our breakfast!

We didn't have breakfast included in our rate and so paid for it additionally for \u20ac10 each per day so not the cheapest but the buffet had a good selection of Continental items (fruit, cereal, meats, cheeses, pastries) as well as some cooked items and definitely set us up for all the walking we did each day!

We were given a room upgrade to a suite as our room wasn't ready when we went to check in early - which was a nice surprise. The room itself had no view but was large and had a separate seating area. We didn't care about the lack of view because we spent a lot of time on the rooftop terrace overlooking stunning view of Barcelona. Our fiends complained that the rooms were small but that was the only complaint overall we were all very happy with the hotel. Staff very friendly and the cool glass of Cava was a welcome touch on check-in. You can buy tickets for the open-top bus tours at reception at a discount, and the bus stop is just around the corner. About 30 euro to the airport in a taxi. Not the cheapest hotel but it does give good style - and not stuffy but rather a quite friendly boutique hotel. Tip: if you are staying in the hot months, leave a key card in the slot in the room to keep the air con on - otherwise it goes off with the lights when you are out and about and you will come back to a really hot room.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cMake sure you see your credit card charge before accepting room.\u201d", "Author": "Ghiverney", "ReviewID": "UR117675414", "Content": "I called the H10 Montacada to enquire about a room price for 2 nights and was advised 180E.

Me and my two young daughters came with 6 pieces of luggage and again I asked the cost and was again told 180E and again I asked, \"Is that for one night or two nights\", and again was told \"that is for two nights\". I signed the contract which stated 180E. They were kind enough and allowed us to leave our luggage until the 3pm check in time. We returned and I was given the keys and the credit card bill which showed 360E. I said, that this was a mistake as it was to be 180E. The receptionist pulled out the contract to show me and now beside the 180E was written, x 2 ngts. This was not originally there as I specifically looked for this earlier. The woman I spoke with had no customer service or people skills and I asked to speak with the manager and she told me she was the manager! My daughters and I had just arrived from a terrible apartment rental problem in which the apartment we had rented was 35C and the sewer smell was so strong it kept us awake the previous night. I took this apartment because it had AC, which now did not...(do not rent from Barcelona Next Door) and I was not willing to expose my children to this. We left the apartment without any compensation whatsoever. We had two days in Barcelona and I was not wishing to spend anymore time in locating accommodations and so in tears, I took this hotel room. The room was small and the bathroom was about the size of the room. The beds were the worst I have ever slept on. I like a hard mattress too but this was like sleeping on rocks!

The harbour is 5 minutes away, beach 10 - 15 minutes walk, las ramblas 10 minutes walk, lots of restaurants in the area so you are not walking far in the evening etc etc Taxi from the airport cost us about 30 euros which isn't too bad if like us you land quite late and don't want to be getting buses etc Overall this holiday was very special with us getting engaged and then having a fantastic hotel and friendly staff it made an overal fantastic week. We will be returning to Barcelona and will definitely be returning to H10 Montcada", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basel, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cAnytime again!\u201d", "Author": "MnMBasel", "ReviewID": "UR100404373", "Content": "The very friendly stuff kept us well entertained with cava till our rooms for ready and helped us in every situation ( nasty pick-pockets in this city).

It was all so whimsical, except for the fact of having a huge pack strapped to my back making my presence being know to everyone. Once we arrived in our room we were brought back to the real world. It was MICRO sized. We had opted for a double (two very small twin beds crammed into an even smaller room) hoping to have some extra space, but that was not so. The room was very clean, but the hassle of moving around and strategically placing our things in the nooks and crannies made our stay less enjoyable. The bathroom was nice and very accessible. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants the NYC minimalist/posh inspired experience. It is expensive and I do believe there are better hotels in the area for the same price. I did have issues bookingthe room for a second night. It was on a Sunday so you would assume that the price would bs the same or cheaper than the night before, but hotel staff charged me \u20ac20 more. I tried to dicuss my frustration with the front desk staff but it was uncessful. So, if you choose to stay at this hotel, book your stay through a discount search engine.

The service from the reception and the bar was wonderful. They must have realised from my passport that it was my birthday and delivered a bottle of cava to our room to help the celebrations. We paid extra for the breakfast and it was first class. A huge array of fresh fruit, cold meats and breads and a cooked breakfast for those that wanted something more substantial. The hotel isn't quiet. We had a room at the back and it was still noisy with the windows open because of the neighbouring air conditioning machines and street noise. But that is the pay off for having such a wonderful central location. Take ear plugs and live with it!!

It will however take you about 5-7mins to walk from the RENFE platform down to the yellow metro line. The hotel is literally opposite Jaume metro station. We bought a T10 ticket at the RENFE station at the airport and at only \u20ac8.45 for 10 trips (if you change transport with 90mins of first journey then it is only one trip) is great value as it can be used on the bus, tram, train and metro.

The cost if you hadn\u2019t paid was \u20ac9.99 (special offer in January, normally \u20ac14.99) but it really sets you up for the day.

Everything about the hotel was lovely, the service the area the rooms even the one I requested was offered. Champagne on arrival. However, when we arrived, as we always do we felt like a freshen up and cool down and a trip to the roof terrace was favourite as the jacuzzi on the brochure looked very inviting. We caught the lift to the 10th floor and was met with a barrier and a sign saying private party. According to the hotel the only time the terrace/ jacuzzi was available was if it hadn't been hired out. There was a wedding on that day so it was out of bounds. Also if you wanted, you could rent the jacuzzi for 2 hours at a time at a charge of 69 euros inclusive of massage and tropical fruit. Whilst this happened yet again it could not be used. Most days this happened and we ended up using the jacuzzi only between 10am and 1pm. Other days the terrace would be hired for business lunches and private parties and that ws out of bounds too. This is not mentioned and i think very greedy. They would make just as much money at the terrace bar if it was used by the guests at any time. Other than that we had a fab hol. But i would not return. Grande Central next door has an extended area for bathing and a pool for only the guests. Would recommend if you weren't bothered about the terrace etc.", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "311visit", "ReviewID": "UR79103804", "Content": "We recently spent part of our honeymoon at the H10 Montcada.

The H10 Montcada is a fantastic hotel in a perfect location with great views and is away from the noise of las Ramblas, (full of hostels and 2am clubs) but just a 10 min speed walk or 30 min amble along the winding passages browsing in all the shops. It is also just a few mins from Placa de Catalunya which is very much a central point for which to either go down La Ramblas or any other street. The negative comments about the room sizes in some reviews is unfair and just inexperienced, although only seeing 1 room of course. It is a central city hotel and having done a cpl of Euro trips and New York these are all of a similar size. This also goes for the subway noise, you can bearly hear it and certainly don't view it as a bad comment about this hotel, it is less than having your washing machine on when you are in bed and we all sleep through that. My girlfiend didnt even notice it and she reads before sleep. The hotel and room was v modern, well air conditioned and the staff helpful when asked about trip recommendations etc. We got offered a drink on arrival and the breakfast, which we got included, was great with a buffet type selection inc full English and fantastic pastries. As for the roof top lounge/ bar \u2013 this is a big bonus! It must be 1 of only a cpl of hotels with a rooftop and the views are panoramic across the city and you can spend a fantastic night watching the sun go down sipping cocktails or having a beer. We went on a bus tour of the city and to the places you cannot walk to and this inc the La Sagrada Famililia, Parc Guell and the Nou Camp stadium. You can hope on and off as you want and the main \u2018starting points\u2019 inc buying tickets is Place de Catalunya. Overall the city is not as expensive as expected and cities such as Rome and Paris and is generally on par with pricing levels the UK. The streets are full of little local shops as well as big high street names and every time we went out we walked a different way. I would also recommend this for food and drink as everything other than on La Ramblas is as you would pay here on which ever level. We read about the pickpockets and bag snatchers on here and in the guide books and have not seen it mentioned as much about any other city. That said, there was plenty of police about (more than you see on the UK streets) and we didn\u2019t experience, see or hear of anything. Bottom line is don\u2019t be put off or think you need to wear protective clothing but just use common sense. Don\u2019t put your bags on spare chairs or the floor in crowds, don\u2019t wave your money about and in crowds just put your hands on your bag or in pockets \u2013 simple.

We'd recommend 'Sinatra's',( tucked away on Carrier Heures, just off Calle de Ferran and near Placa Reial) for a delicious modern take on Tapas. Regarding safety, I think it's a question of being 'street wise'. I took an inconspicuous bag which I could wear across the body and kept the contents to a minimum. Walk with confidence and don't go down dimly lit side streets at night, You wouldn't do that in your home city/town so why change your behaviour in a new city? Barcelona is an amazing, vibrant city.

Room was relatively small, although the bathroom was lovely with a large walk-in shower. There was a flatscreen TV with some English channels and a minibar, and the decor was contemporary. Only downside was the rock-hard bed - however it didn't annoy me enough to request a room change. There is a roof-top jacuzzi and bar, although these were closed when we visited - there were some pretty strong winds while we were there, which is probably why. The bar on the ground floor sells a small selection of food, bar snacks and drinks, all very reasonably priced. In terms of location, it doesn't get much better. We were approximately 10 minutes walk from Las Ramblas, right on the edge of the Gothic Quarter. There were shops, bars and restaurants all around, although it didn't get noisy at night (we were there over a weekend). We flew into Girona, and took the air coach into the coach station, picking up a taxi to our hotel - all very quick, easy and cheap.

We got a taxi back from the ground as the queue was huge to get into the subway, this cost about 12 Euros. We also did a tour of the Nou Camp and incorporated a hop on and off tour bus into this as this stops right outside the camp. The tour is a must, very impressive - 17 euros.

To tell the truth it felt a little bit like if they were calling us theives. I wouldn't mind paying at the check-in, if they had bad experiences in the past. But the fact it happened in the middle of the stay suggests that first they thought us reliable and then changed their mind. Also the invoice had wrong tax figures, but they couldn't explain why.

Close to La Rambla but far enough away so it's not right in your face, this hotel is situated right between El Born and the Gothic Quarter - the two best bits of Barcelona - with the beach a 15 minute walk away. The hotel itself is obviously of a good standard... cava on arrival, very polite staff, everything immaculately clean. However, the room we were given (607) was an internal-facing room - there's one on each floor (all probably x07's) facing into a dim outside space between the corridors. I was expecting a small room but this one literally had enough room for the bed, with almost no natural light - it really was like a cell. So for the first time ever, I asked to be moved, which they did the next day, and the new room faced over the main road and, although small, was perfectly nice. Windows are locked shut and keep out the road noise - but we like a bit of noise and prefer fresh air, so they lent us the window key without any queries. The rooftop terrace is lovely, but the bar only opens 4.30-10.30, and they close the whole thing after that so you can't even sit out and enjoy some night air which is a shame. The Jacuzzi is free until 1.30, but we stayed in much after that on one day as there was no-one up there to tell us otherwise! (just remove the rope they block it off with!!) Our tip is if you want a relaxing couple of hours is to buy some drinks from the supermarket nearby, stick them in the fridge in the gym just off the terrace, and have a thoroughly nice (and cheap!) few hours in the sun! Wouldn't recommend food, massage, romantic packages etc - all appear overpriced (\u00a379 euro for a jacuzzi, massage and a bit of tapas).

The Hotel was excellent, its location is in the gothic district, very close to some lovely restaurants and bars. The hotel is opposite a metro station, about 200 yards down the road from a stop for the Hop on-Hop off tourist bus(recommended-but dont buy tickets in the hotel as they charge \u00a34 for stuff you get free on the bus!!), so transport is very close indeed. However, we walked mosty of the time as the gothic area is the prettiest oldy-worldy bit. Las Ramblas is only a 5-10 min walk away, but after you have seen it once you wont want to go back, so you will be glad its a 5-10 min walk away. Museo Picasso is about a 5 min walk around the corner, but get there before 10, or you will queue for hours! The beaches are briliant, get there early as they do get busy, but its just 2 stops on the metro from the station right outside the hotel. If you come out of the hotel and turn right, up the road are a few nice looking italian restaurants very close by. However, its well worth a wander arond the gothic areas quaint bars and restaurants, as the meals are reasonably priced and taste great. Try not to eat on the beachfront, especially Opium, as the menu is limited and very expensive and service is not great at all. We went to 2 bars in the gothic area i would highly recoomend, MIlk and Shilling. Both serve very nice cocktails at a good price in lovely venues. The cocktails on the hotel roof terrace are nice, but pricey unless you go between 4-6pm, as thats their happy hour. Back to the hotel, The rooms are very modern, with good bathrooms. i recommend you get the buffet breakfast as it has everything and sets you up nicely for the day. The service was brilliant, the staff very friendly and bi lingual.

So we purpously chose somewhere which we hoped would give us a bit of luxury at a reasonable price. When we arrived the girl at reception proceeded to give us a lecture on pick pockets in Barcelona and persuaded us to give our passports and valuables to be locked in the luggage cupboard. I know she was just trying to be helpful but it wasn't the most welcoming reception and made us very paranoid about our bags and wallets throughout the trip. As we had arrived early we were sent off to explore Barcelona and were very pleased to find out how easy it was to get around and how well our hotel was located with the bustly Ramblas 10 minutes walk away. When we returned we were given our room key and a glass of Cava each to take to our room, which was a lovely touch. Our room was really lovely and perfectly spacious enough for our needs. Unfortunately when i went to use the shower it started to overflow and seep into the bathroom. We called reception and they sent up a handy man promptly who unblocked the drains and cleaned up the bathroom. We were a bit fed up about this but we were pleased with the quick response, unfortunately no apology was offered. That evening we decided to eat at the Hotel. This was the most dissapointing meal of the trip. The food was not at all what was described on the menu it was pretty poor quality and tasteless. On another ocassion we ate some tapas at the bar and the food there was much better there. After dinner we took a trip up to the roof and it was truly gorgeous. The loungers were comfortable, and looking out over Barcelona at night was fabulous. We also returned here during the day and lounged in the sun. Unfortunately we never saw anyone manning the bar. The majority of staff were friendly and helpful with the odd grumpy exception. Overall we had a lovely trip but just felt let down that we did not get the total luxury we had hoped for at the hotel.

We found the H10 very reasonable in price and very well located in order to bounce around and see the city. It's directly across from the Jaume subway station, which is quite easy to use and made our stay very nice. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, as we were asking many questions and our Spanish speaking is somewhat limited. They all spoke English and were willing to guide us whenever we needed. The negatives we encountered were mainly that the price of breakfast in the hotel restuarant seems way high (15 Euros), especially when, depending on what you're looking for, you can venture to tons of close by cafes for lower prices. Also, the jacuzzi they advertise on the website is indeed gorgeous, but what they don't tell you is that the only way you can take advantage is if you book a \"romance package,\" which is currently I think 69 Euros and gets you private use of the jacuzzi and drinks at the bar on the rooftop terrace. I just wanted to enjoy the jacuzzi, but what I found instead was that only one couple on 1 day of our 3-day stay ever even booked the package. The rest of the time, the jacuzzi was cordoned off. That, in my opinion, is really stupid!! Maybe that's how they do it in Europe, but we were highly disappointed; however, in no way did it ruin our stay. The only other word of advice I could offer is if you need a ride to the airport, there are plentiful taxis just outside the hotel at almost any hour of the day and night....seriously. We made the mistake of having the hotel get arrange a cab at 3:30 AM because we had a super early flight out. Big mistake. Although they told us the cab would be here 5 minutes early, we thought that was just their way of saying that's our guarantee. What they were really saying is the meter will start running 5 minutes early. That makes no damn sense, as we came down promptly at 3:30 AM and by the time we got our luggage into the trunk and began moving we noticed the meter was already at 8 Euros!! And although this isn't the hotel's fault, the cab driver was a complete [--] and literally kept stopping to explain why the meter was running. A trip that should've been probably 25 Euros ended up at 35 Euros. Either way, we felt that the hotel should've been more clear about when the meter starts. We were on time, and the truth is that we knew we could've walked right outside and gotten a taxi straightaway. We'd been out late a couple nights experiencing the nightlife, and cabs were very plentiful.

We didn't have a huge budget and mostly travel agents websites were coming up with 3 star hotels but the Montcada was amazing value! The location of the hotel is perfect. If you're catching the bus from the airport then it will drop you off at Placa de Catalunya. Walk down the shopping street Portal De l' Angel towards Placa Nova where the front of the old cathedral is, turn left and head towards a big road that is Via Laietana :) It's about a 10 min walk - maybe 15 if you're lugging cases and tired. Upon our arrival we were greeted with cava (spanish champagne) and were shown straight to our room. The hotel is modern, beautiful and very clean. The room is I suppose smaller than is usual in a 4 star hotel but we didn't have any problems. It was modern and there was a safe, a huge flat screen tv, lots of wardrobe space and a big marble bathroom with fresh flowers. Our room also overlooked the famous Santa Maria del Mar church. The service in the hotel was good - reception staff were happy to offer advice and the house keepers were happy to offer us more coat hangers. Like I mentioned earlier - the location of the hotel is wonderful - accross the road from a metro station means that all the sights - park guell, barceloneta, fc barcelona, joan miro foundation, sagrada familiar etc are accessable. Turn left out of the hotel and carry on walking and you get right to Port vell. Once you get to the port which is a short walk away carry on walking left and you get to the beach. The Picasso museum is a must see and is literally 5 mins away. Just turn up Princesa which is to the left of the hotel go up that road and you're there. One thing that cant go unmentioned about this hotel - it is by far it's best feature - the amazing roof terrace! You can see the sea, sagrada familiar, infact you can see the whole of the city it's breathtaking. Make sure you chill out up there a couple of nights with a glass of wine, it's so peaceful and relaxing. You can even eat tapas up there if you like, but we didn't. There's also a pretty jacuzzi up there but it's only free to use in the mornings. A few tips - on the first night if you're shattered there's a lovely homely italian with great food - just turn right out of the hotel, walk a little bit and you're there. I think it's just past a little organic supermarket. For a bigger explore turn left out of the hotel to the trendy el born and gothic quarters and go down the little streets to find some amazing gems. There's a great tapas place that is really spanish called El Rovell. Cheese Me lets you dine in a modern style overlooking the sqaure. Theres also lots of restauantes around santa maria del mar. Make sure you head further away from the hotel some nights as well back towards the centre. Just off the main shopping street, for example, de'angel there is a street called Monts\u00edo which is home to the 4 cats restarant. Wow this place in unbelieveable. The rabbit with almonds is delicious. It's traditional catalan dishes and it was where Picasso used to hang out :) We visited La Rambla by accident one night and virtually ran away - it's tacky and has a dangerous air to it at night time. The restarants there looked dirty and were expensive anyway. During the day it's worth a visit. I enjoyed seeing the various human statues and listening to the street music but I found it too touristy, overated and disapointing compared with the magic that the real Barcelona has to offer.

The major advantage of staying here is the location. Right on the Via Laietana which is a very busy road between the Gothic Quarter and the La Ribera. The Jaume I Metro stop is directly opposite the hotel which is very convenient as the Metro stops outside most of the major sights in the city. The hotel is in an ideal location for exploring the Gothic Quarter on foot and the beach is only a 10 minute walk away if you go via Carrer Argenteria as this takes you through the winding streets and brings you out in front of the Museu d'Historia de Catalunya. There are loads of restaurants nearby, we recommend exploring down Carrer Argenteria for some decent places. The lovely roof top terrace is an ideal way to get your bearings and it gives wonderful views of the sea, cathedral and the rest of the city. Drinks are expensive (10 euros for a mojito) but they are worth every penny. There is a rooftop jacuzzi which guests can use if they make a prior booking. There are also sun loungers available should you decide to give the city sights a break. We enjoyed the terrace so much that we used it every day. The only downside was that the terrace bar closed at 10:30pm but I think some guests took up drinks which they had purchased from the bar downstairs. The rooms were a little on the small size but adequate for 2 people. We had a double wardrobe and plenty of other storage space around the room. The private safe in the room was also very handy. Air conditioning worked well and there was a TV in the room showing a few English channels for those who wanted it. The bathroom was of a very good size and the big walk in shower was very welcome after a long day of walking. Housekeeping were very efficient and did a good job as the room was spotless all week. The only issue we had with the room was the noise levels. As we were on the 3rd floor we could hear most of the street noise and the the occasional metro train rumbling through. We did request a room on a higher floor prior to our stay but this was not honoured. We decided to opt out of breakfast and at 15 euros per person, we weren't sure that it would provide good value for money. Instead we walked across the road to the Placa del Rei every morning to a little cafe called Buenas Migas which served delicious toast and English Breakfast tea for around 4 euros. There are also a few places to get pastries and coffees in the Placa de L'Angel next to the Metro stop. The staff were very polite and were able to provide recommendations for restaurants, etc. The reception staff were also very friendly and the glass of cava on arrival was a nice touch.

We were told we were in luck, asked to pack up our suitcases and leave them with reception, room would be available about 3pm. 3pm came and went, by 5pm the room was ready..... another non-smoking room!!

Ms. Anna J. answered and stated that \"This is not possible...it would be done before 5 PM.\" She intentionally informed the housekeeping staff to make up our room late and it was made up at 4PM. This was not acceptable. We had to personally ask the housekeepers to make up our room each and every afternoon or otherwise it would never have been done. What kind of hotel makes up rooms at 5 PM?

There are no clocks in the room, only one very small garbage can. There is a blow dryer. If you like a/c, the hotel shuts it off during the colder weather, we asked if they could open a window because the heat was on very high. If you want a wake up call, someone knocks on your door.

The hotel has one computer with internet and printer in the main lobby.

I booked direct with the hotel; getting a better deal than going through an agent. ( Try booking direct with hotel you should get a better deal i did.) They sent me correct correspondance to say how to get to the hotel from the airport, using the train, buses or a taxi. We decided to get the train&metro as it seemed fairly straightforward - train from the Airport to Passage de Gracia and then change to the Metro Yellow Line for 2 stops to Jaume 1. It was an easy enough journey and only cost about 10 euros for both of us but due to there not being lifts at the train/metro station we had to carry the baby, buggy and bags up and down flights of stairs which was difficult so we opted for a taxi back to the airport, which cost \u00a330 euros. From Jaume 1 metro station you can see the hotel is just across the road, less than a minutes walk. On arrival the staff were very helpful and spoke good English, although our room was not ready we were allowed to use a room to change our baby and whilst my wife did this I was given a map of the city and was also pointed out some of the local sights within walking distance. We booked the 2 day bus tour for $27 euros each. We did both the blue and red routes one one each day. Well worth the money as you can get on and off as many times as you want. The bus route takes you to all the main attractions. The staff on the buses are very helpful and friendly. We booked the hotel with bed and breakfast. The breakfast is buffet style and the choice is excellent, the only critscism was the english breakfast bacon is nothing like back at home. I strongly advise booking bed and breakfast it does save money. We also had our evening meal as it seemed the cheapest option offering a 3 course menu for 19 euros. The food and service are excellent. The menu consists of a buffet starter of Salad, soup and a pasta dish of the day - you can help yourself to as much as you like and there is also free Cava available. The main course and dessert are also very nice with a good choice to choose from. The hotel is in an excellent location and within comfortable walking distance you can visit The Port, La Rambla, The Cathedral and Catalyuna Square. We walked to the harbour and went to the Aquarium. It cost 15.50 euros with a discount voucher you get from the bus tour route. (The voucher book has some good savings inside). The aquarium is amazing and well worth the money. When we came out lining the path were street traders trying to sell goods. Dont be put off by them as there are plenty of police around and as soon as they see the police they run off.

The rooms are very clean, if at some points a little warm and the air conditioning didnt seem to work as well as it should, but im sure it wqas only because of the time of year and the hotel probably can control it in different seasons. The main and best part of the hotel was the sun terrace and Jacuzzi on the roof of the hotel and the view was out of this world. We didnt get to use the jacuzzi or bar up there as they were not open this time of year but i can imagine that you can have a really amazing experience up there in the warmer months and there is also a gym and spa that can be booked also. There is also a nice bar and restaurant area where you can sit and relax and just watch the world go by.

When we checked in we were given a glass of champagne each which was a nice touch and then given some leaflets and a map of Barcelona which I always think is a great bonus to receive when checking in to a hotel. We had room 701 - I had emailed ahead asking for a corner room as they tend to be bigger. The room wasnt huge but it was more than ok for us, the decor was clean and modern and the bathroom was very nice with lots of comp toiletrees and clean towels. There are also free safes in the room which to us was another plus. The hotel lobby/bar area looked nice and was often quite busy. The hotel also has a rooftop terrace which was lovely to go to and take in the views of the city. We didnt use the restaurant pr have breakfast but the dinner menu seemed quite reasonably priced and looked nice. The reception staff and \"bell boy\" were very helpful and printed us lots of timetables out when we enquired about getting the airport train on our return. The location was excellent, right beside the hotel is a metro station (Jaume I) and there are shops, restaurants and cafes all in the immediate area. The hotel is on a long main road, one direction leads you to plaza catalunya/las ramblas and the other direction leads you to Port Vell which is a lovely marina with a shopping centre, cinema, restaurants and aqaurium. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted with ease. It took about 10-20mins to reach Port Vell, Las Ramblas, Arc De Triumph and other tourist attractions. We used the night buses in the evening and found them very convenient and easy to use. We also used a bus to reach the beach which is situated at port olympic, another lovely marina which seemed to have the most night life and nice restaurants, also a casino. All in all we enjoyed Barcelona. We did find it expensive but that is probably because the euro-pound is so low at the moment. We didnt think much of Las Ramblas and am glad we didnt stay too close to it. We did see a few \"dodgey\" characters on street corners trying to sell you \"smoke\" or cans of beer, but we just avoided or ignored them... you get these sort of characters in all city centres!! We were concerned about the stories of pick pockets so we decided to take minimal cash out with us and use as credit card where possible so that we had the protection should we have been pick pocketed. Just left of the hotel entrance is a large cafe called cappuccino which was open until about 1am and ideal for a night cap and cake. There is also a large cafe called Maximilan that sell drinks and food until late, we also ate here and enjoyed it.

Lots of great things to say about it: We weren't sure about where to be based in the city and plumped for somewhere in the Old Town. The Montcada was an excellent choice therefore and it was in easy walking of the Ramblas, Placa Cataluna and near lots of good eateries, shops etc. The nearest metro was across the road. Having got to know the city a little bit, we were glad we didn't stay elsewhere because it meant that we could wonder 'home' late at night without an unnecessarily long trip or using taxi's or other transport. The location also felt safe (safer than Ramblas anyway). We met an English couple who were staying on the Ramblas and after 4 days their impression of Barcelona was that it was 'seedy'. I think this is because they started and ended their days on the Ramblas and spent loads of time there, and it wasn't our impression at all, excpet that like most city's there are seedier areas. The hotel is lovely, clean and efficient. We got a great internet rate which included breakfast for E5 (euros) pp and the bottle of cava and fruit. We weren't going to have the breakfast included thinking we would eat it out everyday, but were really glad we did and at that price. The breakfast buffet is the best I have ever seen in any hotel. Lots of fresh fruit, pastries, cereals, juices, cheese's, meats, hot food etc. It set us up for the day and stopped us having to wonder the streets looking for somewhere (and stopped my partner being irritable with me waiting for me to be ready - because he could get started without me!!). The room is clean and the bathroom was lovely and supplied with lots of toiletries. We were expecting the room to be TINY after the reviews I had read. Whilst it wasn't the largest hotel room in the world, it was absolutely fine, consisting of a double bed, 2 sideboards, built-in wardrobe. a desk, chair, TV, mini-bar. We were out most of the time and only used it for sleeping and washing, and if you wanted to hang out there were other lounges in the hotel where you could do so. The only thing I would have wanted in the room was a decently comfortable armchair...sadly lacking in many hotel rooms. The maid put fresh flowers in the room on day 2 and when the vase broke was super efficient and friendly about clearing it. In fact all the hotel staff were friendly and they all spoke English. Check in and out was simple and they held our luggage on the last day while we went to see the last of the city. The only problem I had with this was that they photocopied our credit card on check-in and took our credit card details twice and I had to ask for the copy of the first time they did it which was done incorrectly. I don't think we had been conned at all, just that we are more rigorous in the UK about these things. Thankfully we weren't pickpocketed or anything else like that. When we were checking out at the hotel a couple came in looking distressed and said someone had just taken something from their backpack. The receptionist told us this is a regular occurrance and the pickpockets can 'smell' when they will have a success. The hotel literature mentioned that someone throwing things at your shirt and saying you have a stain is a common way to pickpocket. We 'wore' bags across our body rather than backpacks and were obviously cautious...and probably lucky. The best restaurant we found was La Fonda near the hotel...ask the hotel for directions. All the meals we had were good, if expensive. La Fonda was good food, good prices, good service and long queues. All in all we were worn out by Barcelona...Park Guell, Picasso Museum, Miro Foundation, Barcelonetta, the two Gaudi houses, cathedral, familia sagrada, shopping, eating and drinking.

Taxi from the airport was about 28 euro's (this included 4 suit cases) I think it's about 3 euros per bag. On arrival we enjoyed a glass of cava and our bags were taken to our room. One thing to mention was that the reception asked for a credit card to swipe incase of damages/mini bar etc. I was not aware of this and had I not have taken my CC card they wanted 30 euros cash for each day! A lot of money to lay out of your spending money so be aware of that. Our room was on the 2nd floor and was TINY and i'm not over exaggerating, I actually gasped when I walked in! I asked for a larger room but was told we would be on the front of the hotel where it is very noisy so we just stayed put and enjoyed 3 quiet nights. When I passed other rooms on the corridor there were some huge rooms so it is possible to get a large room if you prefer. The bathroom was a good size though with excellent shower. There was no safe in our room and we were told this is the case in some rooms, however as we were with other people we used their safe so it was not a problem for us but it maybe if you are alone. The location of the Hotel in my opinion cannot be beat, metro straight outside the door which we never used! The Hotel is very central and we took taxi's to Sagarda Familia (8 euro) and from there Parc Guell. Once we got our bearings we found there were some short cuts up to La Rambla and Catalunya Square etc. One word of warning avoid the narrow street to the left of the Hotel when you come out the front door as we heard of pick pockets operating in that area. If you can brave it there is a lovely jacuzzi outside on the top floor and a really nice lounge area which I can imagine is very popular in the summer months. The bar area of the Hotel is very pleasant for a drink on an evening and I particularly enjoyed the free internet on offer. Breakfast was fantastic with everything you could wish for.

We arrived on Sunday March 2nd and were warmly greeted at reception by two staff, one of whom gave us each a glass of champagne by way of welcome ! We had booked with HOTELSCLICK.COM and chosen the room only option, so can't comment on the breakfast which could have been purchased separately, but which we declined to do. It pays to shop around online, as some sites were over \u00a3100 dearer for the same booking, so we were glad that we went with this company. I had read previous reviews on TRIPADVISOR, and common complaints ranged from the room being too small to it being too noisy. While it is true that the room we had was a shade on the small side, with an admittedly unusual aspect of having a fairly large shower cubicle instead of a bath, we were more than happy with it. As for the noise factor, I do wonder what people look for when they knowingly book a city centre hotel. Our room was at the front on the first floor, and while traffic was heavy during the day as you would expect, at night it eased off considerably and with the double glazed window fully shut, traffic noise, while still prevalent, was at such levels not to interfere with a good night's sleep, and this from one who practically needs total silence and complete darkness to get one ! As for the location, it is in an ideal spot for the tourist attractions of this wonderful city ! Don't waste money on taxis ! We got the bus from Barcelona airport to Plaza Catalunya (\u20ac4.10 p.p !) and simply walked straight down the road to the bottom where the hotel is situated, taking only 10 minutes to do so. Admittedly we only had one small suitcase with us for such a short stay. Las Ramblas is less than a 5 minute stroll away and you don't need to venture far for a great abundance of really nice restaurants for your evening meal. Staff, be it at reception, or in the bar area in the foyer, were nothing other than well mannered and pleasant and were a credit to their hotel. A small, but nevertheless important plus point for all you websurfers out there, is that internet access in the foyer is free, unlike all other hotels I have been in which charge a nominal fee for ten minutes usage.

This is a great friendly hotel, staff are helpful and always cheerful. I booked it through lastminute.com (as it was cheaper than direct oddly enough), and the flights i sorted seperately (morning inbound, evening outbound) It's nothing like your typical package holiday hotel, and eminates a certain level of classiness, glorious marble floors and surroundings with modern looks befitting the younger/middle age generation. Being greeted by a glass of Cava was a nice touch on our arrival. Breakfasts are amazing with a wide variety of dishes available (although someone should teach the spanish how to make scrambled eggs :P - but this isn't limted to this hotel alone and seems to be a \"spanish\" trait). The only small item which took the shine off this is that we where placed in a 1st floor room and the walk in shower leaked out onto the floor and into the bedroom area. The hotel staff new about this and where happy enough to supply additional towels to clean this up, but I am not sure if it was just limited to this room, adn i thought ti could have recieved a better response. We plumped for the Jacuzzi option and I can say was thoroughly enjoyable (although cold as hell). Roof terrace is amazing, with fantasic views, drinks up there can be a tad expensive, but it's worth it just for the view/environment, and serves well as a pre curser to going out for dinner. You will find that Barcelona is more expensive than other spanish areas, and this seems to be the case in Barca in general; more so if you spend time on the Ramblas (so try to steer clear when eating). There are a few really nice restaurants in the area, and most don't generally open until about 20:30 onwards. It isn't unusual here to eat late and everywhere doesnt really come alive until post 10:30 anyway, and in some places, post midnight. If you really like seafood try El Chipiron in Port Vell (by Mare Magnum), an outside table (upstairs) overlooking the bay is a real treat, cost varies, but at a minimum is about 25-30 Euro each for a main meal/drink, and increases as you go more towards the platters (but these can be shared as they are huge), there are also options for the less adventurous (chicken, lamb etc). La Fonda in the Gothic Quarter is great too (on E'scudellers), although be prepared to queue if you arrive post 10pm (this is apparently a typical sign of a good restaurant so you will find a few places like this). Three Courses and a bottle of wine here is about 50 Euro, so its well worth it if you want \"bang for buck\" and the food is fantastic. Try to steer clear of Placa Reial at night (or more so the part where you enter from the Ramblas), as there can be a few \"undesirables\" hanging around in large groups (supposedly Algerian immigrants), and you need to be a little more aware of whos around you. Make sure you keep hold of your belongings, there were a few occasions where it was apparant we were being followed, but as long as you know whats going on you should be ok. Once thing i will say is that for me personally the nightlife was better than the day, but it is very centered around dinner, wine a few beers and relaxing rather than the traditional pub scene (i guess thats because there is a large amount of walking to be done during the day) but if you want that, there are a few Irish Bars around which are always good too. Also, don't get too worried if you get some strange stares from the locals, this seems to be a common thing especially shoe wise (as they supposedly love their shoes), and in some cases the older locals are not fond of the younger looks (short dresses etc), but that doesn't stop you from looking good, and i found that the majority of tourists, didn't really care what they wore. If you have never been to Barcelona before, and despite the shoulder shruggable \"oh well\" problems i can really recommend this hotel.

The room although small was perfectly adequate, comfortable and spotlessly clean, with a good selection of toiletries, even two toothbrushes with sachets of paste and also a razor with gel, the maid opened the window for us when requested to as there was no way we could open it, at first we were disappointed with the view from the room, but decided we were glad it was on the quiet side of the building and we realised it had interesting views rather than the busy front street. I left a note for maid asking for two extra pillows {dos almohadas mas} and they were there when we returned to the room. The roof terrace is a definite bonus and the views for the keen photographer (like me) cannot be beaten! Although they have a jacuzzi on the roof it was a bit cool up there in March for anyone to be using it, but I am sure it will be popular in more clement weather, with plenty of sun loungers ...so quiet up on the roof!!! Very nice breakfast with lots of choices of fresh fruit and a fine array of the usual cold things, plus a nice hot buffet too...I loved their little spicy chorritzos along with the delicious scrambled eggs! Breakfast serving staff were very attentive and pleasant. Being in the middle of the Gothic Quarter there was no shortage of interesting things to see, we still haven't seen everything we want to so we have booked up for another stay in August, this time booking direct with the hotel for a better rate, with cheap flights. Best to eat at tapas restaurants in the Gothic Quarter, you can choose several dishes to share which makes for an interesting meal.

Much of the discussion appeared to be about the size of the bed but I didn't say anything until we were taken to the room - 211. It was tiny and stunk of smoke even though I had requested non-smoking. Window could not be opened. Small bed with only just enough room to walk by if you edged up the side of the wall. Simply awful. Straight down to reception to be told they were full! Told them I am asthmatic at which point they then offered another room which had not been made- up. Went to see it - marginally better rather like a cell! After creating yet again, speaking in spanish so they knew I understood their earlier conversation, they said they would move us the next day if we would stay in the 2nd room offered for one night. The next day we stayed in room 502 - much better with nice bathroom in which we could open the large window. Even though it was not that big it was very pleasant and had we have checked into this room the first day we would have unpacked and started our holiday very happily. If you look at the floor plans, the same for each floor, you can see the same tiny rooms run throughout the hotel in the same position. They are not big enough for one person even and feel very claustrophobic , being internal rooms with no opening windows. The people who have enjoyed this Hotel are quite right, it is in a great position, and I too don't need to spend long in the room, but if they had been given the rooms we were first offered they would give the same review.

We had to go back and ask for another room but were told that we had no right to a mini bar or any extra's. Luckily we had printed out our confirmation and sunddenly the awkward attitude changed. We had to wait over an hour for our room and noticed that if you spoke with an american accent then you got treat with a lot more respect. We have been all over the world and this is not a 4 star hotel it did not even have a swimming pool, the bar closed really early and the staffs attitude ,especially nicole was so rude. Their are a lot more hotels in barcelona that are cheaper with better facilities. Shop around as the choice is quite wide.

The bathroom was bigger then the main room and was lovely although watch out for the spray as the screen could do with being a bit bigger but we did have a bath too!! It was so small that the TV had to be wall mounted and was flatscreen WHEN it was working!! Service from most of the staff was awful and they didnt seem to listen or respond to anything you asked. It took over 8 hours and reminders to get some extra clothes hangers. Many of the staff had a poor grasp of english which made things very difficult. Whilst I appreciate I am in another country in an international hotel you would expect a certain level of understanding of english??!! We did make a formal complaint and noticed that after this things did improve slightly in the attitude of the staff, particularly with the breakfast service. This was awful on our first two mornings. Kept us waiting to be seating, food running out, unhelpful etc...

We went up to our room and although a little small, it was modern, clean, fresh and cool, We dumped our bags and went up to the roof. The views from the top are great and you get to see a lot of Barcelona. There are sun loungers, seats, tables and a shaded area. The best bit is the jacuzzi, just sit in, relax and read a book looking over the city! (Best done while the sun is setting) Breakfast was a great surprize, pleanty to choose from and tasty too! The hotel staff are great, I quizzed them (in English) about lots of the usuall holiday stuff, best way to see the city, places to eat, places to drink and they couldn't have been more helpful. To sum up: Excellent Hotel in an excellent location with excellent staff in an excellent city!! PS You must eat at a restaurant called 'Taller de Tapas' that is a short walk from Montcada. We ate there about 5-6 times on our 4 day trip! PPS BEWARE of bag snatchers on the ally next to the hotel!! Don't let this put you off, it happens in every city!!

I ordered the bumper package with the robes, champagne etc but we ended up leaving them in the packages as it wasn't a room made for relaxing in Robes and drinking champagne etc. We just wanted to get out of there. Next was the Breakfast. The ladies serving weren't very pleasant to say the least. I phoned for it to be brought to the room and I was told that I would have to pay for the full breakfast (even though it was part of the package) plus extras. The menu in the room said that there was just a 3 euro charge for bringing it to the room. I went down for Breakfast at 10.15 (Serves until 10.30) and I it was pretty much thrown at me. I asked the girl at the reception where was good place for dinner around the area. She said nowhere. We sat and had a meal in the \"lobby\" (read below). While having the meal I overheard another person asking a different girl at reception the same question, where was good around the area for dinner?, and she gave him a list of places! When you enter the hotel, the reception is in the lobby. This is a nice area with a bar BUT is was also used as the restaurant in the evening. Which like the bedrooms, cramps your style. The food was nice the first night. The second night my partner asked for her salmon to be well done. It was so on the outside but raw on the inside. She ended up ordering another dish that she was charged for. We asked for a wake up call on our last night that we had to get a flight the following morning. We had a few drinks and our mobile phones were dead (no alarms) so we pleaded with them to keep ringing us and make sure we got up. They didn't. First they said they didn't have the list. Then they said they made all the calls and a room that didn't answer, they called up to and knocked until the people got up. They did not do either for us. We missed our flights, had to stay another night in the hotel and pay another 400 euros for flights, along with missing a days work. They would not except responsibility. An hour later the changed their story and said they called us and we answered. We know this didn't happen.

We asked to be moved but were told that no other rooms available. Just as I was walking away from reception, a couple wallked in off the street and asked for a double room. They duly obliged. The breakfast was reasonably good but on Sat morning (25 Feb) was told that basement restaurant had flooded and a limited 'cold' breakfast was being served in the bar area - friut, bread,cereals . No apology was made and the staff seemed unconcerned. I repeatedly asked for some croissants but in the end gave up and went out for breakfast.

To be fair there was no quibble about this, and for reference, the twin rooms tend to be larger than the doubles. However, even having acquired more space, the room was basic. Small details such as no full length hanging space, no sockets near a mirror (other than in the bathroom), one pillow per person, no tea/coffee etc etc I should point out that none of this would have bothered me in the least if I had paid a bargain price, but this hotel is vastly over valued/graded.

So; ======================== Good points about this hotel are ======================== * The bathroom is clean and modern * The breakfast * Location * Free net access * Breakfast service staff * Good views from the terrace ======================== The bad points ======================== * The rooms are very small *in fact too small * Beds are not great * Rooms 507, 607, 707 and the ones ending in 11 are the smallest and if you use lastminute/expedia to book then be sure to bring a fan. * Jacuzzi is ice cold- not working at all * Bar Closes early * Hotel is currently under refurbishment- floors 6 & 7- be prepared for drilling noises-bangs at 8 in the morning ======================== Recommendations ======================== * If you are checked in to 507 or similar ask immediately to be moved * If you cannot move- a tip is too run the shower in the bathroom (cold tap) and close up the door for fifteen minutes- then open the door to let you have some cold air (first I've done this in a four ****hotel!!!!) * Bring lots of face creams etc- otherwise your skin will dry out with the heat in the room. * Bring good company (I did) as you will probably not get much sleep in 507 etc ======================== Would I stay at this hotel again? ======================== The Answer is no.

I've just returned from a few days in Barcelona, we were part of a fairly large contingent of people who were over for a wedding. Tuesday night my friends bag was snatched just outside the hotel at the pedestrian crossing. Thursday night another member of the wedding group who was staying at the hotel had their bag snatched outside the hotel at the same pedestrian crossing. Saturday night two more people who were staying at the hotel had their bags snatched within half an hour of each other at the same location. While I realise that the hotel is not responsible for these crimes I really do not feel that they impressed enough on people the danger that exists. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. It is obviously targeted by bag-snatchers. Of the five days we were there four people that left the hotel had their bags snatched. There could even have been more. The hotel was relatively nice. Luckily we managed to avoid the dreaded small rooms. However its impossible to relax for the holiday as you learn to dread each time you step outside the hotel.

It was so near everthing, the ramblas ( overrated!) the tourist bus stop ( great for seeing all the sights, easy peasy and cheap) and being right in the gothic quarter was amazing. It was our favourite part of Barcelona and we could walk everywhere. Narrow streets, full of shops, restaurants, shadowed by a huge cathedral, museum full of Dali's paintings and sculpture, street performers and you can even walk 6 mins and be at the huge department store el corte ingles......The hotel staff were very friendly, no problems there at all. The receptionist explained how we used the tourist bus, booked a taxi for us to the marina......how stupid were we , it was only a 2 minute drive! At the top of the hotel on the roof there is a hot tub and you can take drinks up there to see the panoramic view. From there you can see just how close you are to the marina and see for miles. We went up there after we had checked out whilst waiting for the time for us to leave for the airport. The hotel were fine about this. It was lovely in the sun up there as our hotel room had no balcony. One problem we had was the window. You had to ask to get it opened and shut. My friend was a smoker so this was a bit of a hassle and we decided to leave it open full time. Only problem was at night you could hear the distant noise of the city and more local noise like dogs barking and mopeds. Shutting the window would have dulled this but I didn't want to keep asking the porter to come up to our room.....nice as he was! Breakfast was lovely. Everything was there, bacon, muffins, fresh strawberries, melon, salmon and a drawer full of teas to choose from, including ENGLISH. It was a very calm start to the morning.
