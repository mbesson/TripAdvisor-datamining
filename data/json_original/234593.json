We had lost our luggage and missed a night at the hotel due to snow and the hotel had printed out all of the messages that we sent them about our stay (and kept our room open for us) and they took down any notation necessary about our luggage. They also provided us with a toothbrush and toothpaste. They were willing and able to help in any way possible. The rooms at the hotel were roomy (by Europe standards), clean, well decorated and comfortable. The hotel is off of Kurfurstendammstrasse (the shopping center of what was West Berlin). It is a busy street with a lot of shops and places to eat. It is also close to the Uhlandstrasse U-bahn stop. (The stop is on the corner of Uhlandstrasse and Kurfurstendammstrasse.) I recommend taking the U-bahn whenever possible as the hotel is a long walk from many of the sights (like the Brandenburg Gate). My husband and I walked to the Brandenburg Gate, and while it is do-able, it took us over 2 hours (in very cold, snowy weather!), so we took the U-bahn back to our hotel--quick and easy to use!

On checking-in on Wednesday Nov. 24, 2010, my original room, # 416, was so small, it was claustrophobic. Problems with the room included: a) carpeting was very badly stained, b)the lamp in the room was shorting and did not work so no main light in the room, c) broken furniture, d) extensive mold on the ceiling in the corners, a indication water leakage from outside. A bathroom so small you had to straddle the toilet, in order to close the bathroom door to enter the shower! In the middle of the night, I saw 2 roaches in the bathroom. After being up for almost 55 hours, I did not have the energy to complain. On Nov 25, 2010, I requested of the front desk to change my room because of the problems with the room( I also submitted to them a list of the problems). The front desk staff were very accommodating in switching my room, another room(#207).

There are no breakfast places near the hotel, but 2 supermarkets around the block from the Mark Apart. As a previous guess to the Mark Berlin, I felt that the MarK Apart, would be slightly below the Mark Berlin, not in needing so much work. I was totally disappointed in the Mark Apart. It is sad that its owners allowed it to become so shabby and rundown before renovating it. I would be reluctant to stay in another Mark Hotel with such un-even standards. I submitted a request to Mark Hotels head office for a e-mail or regular mailing address to submit a formal letter of complaint. I have not heard back from them.

Breakfast was nice, a little more choice than I've had at other european hotels I've stayed in, decent breakfast for a 3* hotel. Staff we founf to be very friendly and all spoke english. We arrived about midnight and were hungry, we found that a lot of resturaunts stay open well into the early hours of the morning serving hot food, so we found ourselves eating out at 1 in the moring. When you arrive at the airport take the S-Bahn to Zoo station, you buy you ticket at the station, but don't forget to validate it in the red boxes on the platform. I think it was only a couple of euros and the trip lasts around 40 mins. Once you arrive at zoo either take a taxi from outside the station to the hotel or it's about a 15 minute walk. We travelled in July and it was incredibly hot, so dont forget to take suncream and a hat if you travel in the summer months. We found walking aroung Berlin good for sightseeing, however we were knackered after the first day so opted for public transport after this. We bought a day pass for 6 euros each from the zoo station, you only validate it once but you can use the puiblic transport as much as you like. I dont know if you need a separate ticket for the S-Bahn and U-Bahn as we only used the S-Bahn. Alternatively you can buy a single ticket which I think is valid for two hours for about 2.60 euros. There is a U-Bahn stop relatively close to the hotel, called Ulandstrasse.

The excellent breakfast is served between 6.00 and 12.00 and is replenished, so there is always a good choice, including cooked items. Ask if you want tea rather than coffee. The area is near the Ku'Damm and it's best to use the Uhlandstra\u00dfe underground, though if you want an direct journey from Sch\u00f6nefeld without changing trains, take the S9 to Savignyplatz, which is a longer walk. Make sure you leave at the Savignyplatz side of the station. The restaurant /bar next door served us food at almost midnight and we didn't feel rushed. When we left the hotel, we were able to leave bags and there is a guest-toilet with space to get organised before departure if your flight is later in the day. The only downside to this hotel is the overt porn that appears before the pay TV sign, so if you're channel-hopping, it's there.
