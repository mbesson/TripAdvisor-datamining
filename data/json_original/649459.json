{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Beware, fabric eating bugs! I would give five stars to the non-english speaking service staff and excellent location...but excellent kind of ends there...the air conditioning goes off periodically and there's nothing you can do about it in the middle of a hot stuff tropical night. I was given a table fan the following day while the air was fixed. But what's worse, is a trillion or more bugs chomping through your clothes. I have recently moved to Hong Kong, and was staying at this hotel for 4 weeks till I moved to my own appartment. Initially I noticed microcopic holes in my clothes, then 2 weeks later when I was separating my clothes for laundry I discovered almost all of them were severly bitten through to the point that they have been rendered useless to wear, either that or I wear these rags as a high-end fashion statement! Fortunately it's Hong Kong and tailors abound...all the same it's expensive and my wallet is getting smaller...all the same alternatives for these rates (HK $15000) abound if you book about 2/3 months in advance.", "Date": "Apr 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR959527548", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Stuti"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d649459-r7295481-Excellent_Court-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "649459", "Price": "\" id=\"hotel_649459\">"}}
