I was originally booked for a king room, but was upgraded to a double queen room with loft. I couldn't ask for anything better for the price that I paid. The room contained a microwave, small fridge, and had 2 TV's. It was very clean and tastefully appointed. Housekeeping was daily and they did a very good job. I had some friends stay in another room and they mentioned that the street noise was a bit distracting for their sleeping. While I didn't have that problem, I could definitely see what they were talking about. Breakfast was included in the price of the room and had the standard Holiday Inn selection: egg, sausage/bacon, biscuit, gravy, toast, cereal, milk, juice, and pancakes. The seating area was not very plentiful, so several people has to take their plates back to the room. Onsite parking is valet only . . . $15/night. There is a small neighborhood with free street parking, but wasn't sure if it was safe to park overnight. Some great restaurants and shopping about a 10-minute walk away at the mall. The street where the hotel is located is extremely busy, so be careful walking around. If you have to be in the area and can't afford the higher priced hotels nearby (intercontinental, hyatt, etc), this is a great alternative at a very competitive price. Bottom line: Good hotel for the price watchers if you must stay in this immediate area. Ask for a room away from the busy and potentially loud Olympic Blvd side of the hotel. If you are driving, be prepared to pay for valet parking.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Rafael, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "SelbyBrown", "ReviewID": "UR127759836", "Content": "We stayed here because it was close to my niece's apartment.

I picked the location due to the nearby Century City shopping ctr and this hotel is not too far from LAX. I figured we could recover from jetlag and stock up instead of wasting time shopping during the early days of our stay at Disney World ... at the time of booking, I had not realized the American airline policy of charging per bag or limiting wt allowance per bag. The hotel is small but staff are v receptive and helpful. Troy kindly upgraded our room to one with a loft which our greenhorn Ozzie kids got a big kick out of. We did not know about gym passes as welcome gifts for Priority Club members at many Hol Inn locations we have freq but our Hol Inn visits overseas have often offered upgrades without my asking for it, when they are available, dep on how busy they are. There were no noise hassles as we were allocated a room on the top floor away from the noisy side ( a tip from another TA reviewer earlier). The Mexican lady (named Gloria, I think) deserves a pat on her back for being so accomodating cuz we were travelling with our 3 kids, the youngest sleeping in, past the opening hrs of the dining rm. Breakie is complimentary and reasonable, with warm waffles, cereals, meat patties, pancakes, omelettes, individual cartons of milk, coffee/tea etc. It ain't Mariott or Westin but this joint has its own personal touches that make this an amiable warm place to stay ... like the chain's signature cinnamon rolls, little pcs of chocs near the elevator, Wi-Fi and printer facilities in the lobby, The service from the staff is the icing on its cake. Cannot recall all the staff names now but the other 3 were ace too. There is no restaurant at this hotel but who needs that when Century City is just a stone's throw away? Check out www.westfield.com/centurycity - website will advise you on shops there which include Macy's, Bloomingdale's and cinemas. There is a Gelson's supermart with friendly staff. There is also a Wolfgang Puck Express within Gelson's so U don't have to wait to get to Disney. There are a few restaurants as well as a food court but we found the food at Sorabol disappointing wrt its supposedly Korean flavour. Forget about getting voltage converters there for American use. Macy sell converters for Americans to use overseas. I brought along my Smart phone. The Apple and computer shops could not meet my needs and I found a stall outside Macy's which sold me a SIM card for 1 month's capped internet and overseas/local call access for $110 (without the phone) - I felt ripped off but the convenience and a cab to another provider would have cost me more. Go to the Concierge desk with proof that you are not a local from LA and it will give ya a visitor's card offering discounts or freebies. True that we could not walk to anywhere else of interest without developing plantar fascitis or cramps but the staff helped us call a cab for about US$15 that took us to a place that had both Marshall and Ross as well as food at Johnny Rockets/Baja.

So that being said, here we go: Check In/Front Desk: First, locating the hotel is difficult. There are no signs. It is right by a huge sign for the Courtyard by Marriot. So when you see that sign, you know you are in the right place. There is a $15 valet service. The valet guy was incredibly nice and I felt very secure with leaving my vehicle over night there. The front desk person, Troy, seemed very cold at first. He did not welcome me as a priority club member and I did not receive a gift at check in, which at other Holiday Inn Expresses seemed to be the norm. I later inquired about a fitness center and he offered a pass to a gym which was incredibly convenient! He was very helpful and cheery after my initial check in, which was good. There was also another person at the front desk when I checked in. I didn't get a name, but she was incredibly personable and even struck up a little conversation with me, which was welcoming and seemed like natural conversation, where as with other hotel front desk staff, it seems that they ask questions because they have to. The Room: There was a lot of noise from W. Olympic Blvd. in my room. Also I could hear every step being taken in the hallway outside and in the room above mine. I can generally sleep through the noise, but this was a little excessive. The room was clean, except the bath tub looks like it needs a good bleaching. Also, there was a small stain on one of my bed's comforters. One thing about the \"Two Queen Non-Smoking\" beds is that they are small. I sleep on a Queen bed at home, and these were definitely smaller, almost the size of a double bed. The beds are very very comfortable and the room was incredibly spacious. There was a microwave, mini-fridge, flat screen TV, iron and ironing board, small desk and chair. Location: Like I said, incredibly difficult to find. It is in a good area though. There is a grocery store nearby and a great mall with plenty of fine dining opportunities with in walking distance (about 5 blocks) Overall: I liked this hotel's staff and the room wasn't bad.

The spiral staircase led up to a queen bed placed in a serene, blue-painted space, with another huge TV. Some nuts and bolts for the power readers: There is a Ralphs grocery store directly across the street, which has a good stock of small sized items that work well for a short stay. It's on Olympic, the easier way to get across town (than doing Santa Monica Blvd.) As someone else noted, valet parking is super-fast. Breakfast had a good variety but is crammed into a tiny space.

He was very rude and wouldn't even listen to anything I had to say before he assumed it was my fault in the cancellation, saying he does not have a cancellation number on file. He also said that the booking was checking in for 2 nights, then checking back in on the check out date for another 2 nights. Doesn't that seem a bit fishy to you when I only made one reservation? And why would I do that in the first place?! I even got my manager who has been in the travel industry for many years to talk to him.

The hotel is quite small, around 50 rooms or so. We had a room on the 3rd floor which was a large room with king size bed. There was a huge LCD TV and good air conditioning. The bathroom was quite large and very clean with good toiletries and towels. The bath was a standard one but had a jacuzzi setting which was quite nice. The complimentary breakfast was very welcome - as a previous reviewer mentioned, the lady who looks after the breakfast room is very friendly and helpful. She practically insisted we take some fruit and pastries for our trip that day. Other good points are that there is a grocery store opposite if you need food to put in the fridge or to cook in the microwave. Also, there are some restaurants that will deliver food to the hotel. I can recommend the Indian restaurant that delivers, very highly.

Service was unpredictable: the first day I got a very friendly welcome and extra blankets arrived at my room within minutes.

Obviously, you don't expect much from Holiday Inn. They offer basic accommodation at a low price, and usually do so reasonably competently, as long as you're not staying for too long. I only chose Holiday Inn because I was only going to be in LA for one night, and because my priority was to be as close as possible to a specific Century City address, as I am unfamiliar with the city. But this place really failed to live up to Holiday Inn's usual standards. Whether you consider their usual standards to be adequate or not is besides the point - even a true Holiday Inn devotee would struggle to find this sty acceptable. Everything in the building (carpets, furniture, appliances, decor) was at least 30 years old, or had been horribly mistreated in order to give that impression. Nothing was particularly clean and it was all depressingly drab. Front desk staff were genuinely struggling to understand me (whether it was the English language or simply my English accent that caused the problem, I don't know, but if I were foolish enough ever to return, I would come armed with a Spanish phrasebook) and they also managed to lose the suitcase that I left in reception (although it did eventually turn up). The food and furniture that I found in the squalid breakfast room depressed me beyond belief.
