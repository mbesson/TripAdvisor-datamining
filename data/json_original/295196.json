Hotel is located 15/20 minutes walk north of Taksim square and there is alot of activity and shops around the hotel. Don't understand the negativ reviews of no restaurants in the area - nor that there should be prostitudes hanging in the streets next to the hotel... In order to go to Sultanahmet and all the big tourist-atractions such as the blue mosque, aya sofia etc you need to take a taxi (20 LIRA with an honest taxidriver) or go by metro/tram. The metro system doesn't cover the whole city so you need to change two times before you reach Sultanahmet (cost 6 LIRA). However the best and fastest way to get around is by Dolmus, which are small buses (also called metro-bus in Istanbul). This is a speedy hop-on hop-off bus that stops at several stations. It can be tricky to get the right one but people are friendly and asked us if we needed help. Just outside is for example a station which has Besiktas as endstation, and from there you can take the ferry to the Asian side! The dolmus cost only 1,75 LIRA and is also fun to ride! 5 minutes walk from a smaller street with several nice restaurant and I think we were the only tourists there... Hotelstaff was friendly and helped us everyday with all our questions. Only negative was when we asked for restaurant recomendations and specificly asked for their personal favorites! The man in the frontdesk then hands us a businesscard for a restaurant he described as \"very good, I have sent 5000 persons there\" but when we asked how much a maindish was he refused to answer and after we pushed him said \"it depends on how much you drink...\" Well... we didn't go there. Room was fantastic and had just the space we needed. everything looked great and was well decorated. Felt like a livingroom. Anything negative? Bathtub was slow to drain the water and the spare-toilet role we found in a locker wasn't replaced all weekend... We red other reviews about the noisy street and we asked for a room not facing the street, but still we could hear the cars and the honking all night. (but, Istanbul is a huge city and there are cars and people everywhere so I think it's hard to avoid) Breakfast was good but felt boring the third day (yohgurt, egg, fresh fruit, and bread) and I could really use some sausage or omelette. We chose this hotel to aviod the most tourist-streets and we liked that. You cant walk to the big attractions but it's quite fast to go there by dolmus/taxi. Taksim sqaure and all the bars around there isn't that far away though. We are very satisfied with our stay!!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palmerston North, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cRecommended\u201d", "Author": "JD42_11", "ReviewID": "UR121167305", "Content": "Stayed in a corner suite, very nice and well appointed rooms.

Chose the hotel as the only member of design hotels of the world in Istanbul. The decoration is nice and suited our Scandinavian taste. However, as another reviewer wrote, the hotel lacks esprit. It seems like there is no dedication to the concept, the concept by the Italian designers is maintained but without any feeling. This leaves you with a cold feeling at times. Take the lobby for example: It is minimalistic and clean, but I never saw any guests hanging around there, the bar was never staffed but seemed like more of a must have. The lobby is in no way cozy. We stayed in two floor suites, providing us with a lot of space. I must praise the generosity of the hotel for letting our 5th person stay in a sofa-bed free of charge - though the website said max occupancy 2 persons. Rooms are clean and the bed of good quality. The street below is quite busy, so sleeping with the windows/french doors open was not really an option. The espresso machine provided us with better coffee than the one at breakfast, but I was a bit surprised to be charged for the consumption of Nespresso capsules at check-out, though the sum was moderate. Breakfast was good but not very assorted. You could have eggs prepared the way you wanted them. The breakfast area is calm and relaxing, coffee was served at the table. We used the sauna, located in basement together with the gym. The area was modern and the sauna is spacious enough to host 10 people. It felt like the area was not frequently used. Free wifi in the lobby and breakfast area was great, a pity there was no wifi in the rooms. Locationwise, I thought the surrounding streets would be more interesting, now it felt like a stretch to walk down to the Taksim square. I guess it is preferable to stay south of Taksim in the heart of Beyoglu if you visit Istanbul as a tourist.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, great location... great hotel\u201d", "Author": "micmm", "ReviewID": "UR113202540", "Content": "Great service at the front desk, and the location was close to perfect for me and my wife.

The last time was around 4 years ago and I am pleased to say not much had changed. I returned as this is one of my favourite hotel rooms anywhere and I have travelled extensively. The hotel was designed by Piero Lissoni who is a world class product and interior designer. (We own some of his furniture) His approach is that of sophisticated, slightly understated elegant modernity. This is not brash boutique style that looks like an adolescent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream of a night club; it is where you would be happy to live. The hotel itself is modestly sized so there are not a huge number of public facilities such as a pool or spa; it is really about the accommodation. The lobby is slightly ascetic but tranquil and serene. The location is Harbiye, a busy, mixed residential/commercial neighbourhood that is adjacent to Nisantasi, a polished, glamorous smart shopping area that is a joyous relief after the crazy clamour of the older parts of town. Also of note is the Dolmus station that is literally across the road giving rapid and cheap access to the waterfront at Besiktas and the ferries that depart from there regularly. I recommend the 20 minute hop over to Kadikoy, the cultural centre of the Asian side of the city. The suite sits on top of the hotel with full height glazing looking out in one direction to the Bosphorus and towards the Istanbul conurbation in the other. A large paved balcony wraps around the suite with two access doors. There is also an outdoor shower. Internally the floor finishes are oak in the sitting room, carpet in the bedroom and stone in the bathroom. There is an obvious intelligence about all of the design choices that have been made, both from a functional and aesthetic point of view. This is so rare in hotels where compromise tends to be the norm. A calm palette of rich browns and oatmeals is carried throughout with colour mostly deriving from the materials themselves. The soundproofing is excellent. Facilities include a bar/kitchen with 2 mini fridges, a sink and an espresso machine. There is a dining area and a sitting room with CD/radio and T.V. with a good selection of English language channels. The totally separate bedroom has its own T.V. The bathroom is equipped with a Jacuzzi bathtub which we put to full use twice a day. It also has a multi nozzle shower cubicle. Robes and slippers are of good quality. The A/C is first class. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the standard rooms as I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen them but I would imagine that the design ethos is carried through. One measure I have of the hotels that I stay in is how long it takes for Room Service to bring ice, an item that is not chargeable. The Bentley was consistently under 5 minutes, sometimes quicker. Bravo! Elsewhere I have waited up to 45 minutes. Breakfast is slightly underwhelming and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change from day to day although they are happy to cook omelettes and scramble eggs but you have to know to ask. There doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be a menu. On our first visit the Concierge was exceptional but second time around he had left but the desk staff were pleasant and competent save for one unfortunate restaurant recommendation (Park Fora \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do not go there!) There are some excellent restaurants within walking distance. The most notable would be Borsa (10 minutes walk through the park) and Kosebasi (again 10 minutes) in Nisantasi. Although the rack rates are quite high I have found the Bentley willing to negotiate and end up at a price that I think represents excellent value for money. I would return again.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Delhi, India", "Title": "\u201cfar away from the tourist attractions.\u201d", "Author": "Chetan J", "ReviewID": "UR64988022", "Content": "We had booked Tom Tom Suites but were given Bentley Hotel instead by our travel agent due to non-availability of the former. We had already seen the location on the map and knew that it was not the area we wanted to stay in, but we let our agent make the call. We wanted a smaller boutique property instead of the Hiltons etc. Hotel - It is a modern hotel with a classy look. It is located on a main street about 20-30 minute walk away from Taksim square one of the main squares of Istanbul's more modern area on the European side. There is nothing much of interest in the vicinity of the hotel. Taksim is 30 mins. walk away, Dolmabache Palace is also a 30 mins. walk downhill from the hotel. Only the Nisantasi shopping area is close to the hotel - 5 minutes walk away. The street close to the hotel is not very well lit at night & makes you slightly uncomfortable if you are coming from the hustle & bustle & nightlife of taksim / istikal cadessi. Rooms - Clean, large rooms but not very quiet. There was constant noise in the hallway of other guests & staff and it somehow made it to the room. You can even hear the sound of the toilet flush of the neighbouring rooms in your own room and thats definitely not a good feeling. Our A/c also used to make a lot of noise if we raised the air flow level to maximum, so we had to keep it at a low level. There is Free wifi in the lobby & the mezannine restaurant, but no wifi in the rooms. But they do have a LAN cable in the room for internet if you have your laptop.

We booked a corner room, which is a step up from the standard room, but a step down from their suites. It is basically an extra large room with floor to ceiling windows covering the whole corner (provided a ton of light). The room was very modern, very clean and really tasteful (assuming you like W Hotel style decor). The bathroom, small, but nicely laid out, was floor to ceiling Travertine (I'm guessing) with Dorn Bracht plumbing fixtures. The bed was probably the best part...really soft sheets with a nice down comforter (something we didn't experience elsewhere in Turkey). We had a lovely fruit bowl and Turkish Delights waiting for us in the room when we checked in. The lobby was great, with a nice bar that is only staffed when you ask for a drink (they then send a bartender out). The front desk staff was incredibly accomodating (maybe they have read the other reviews here that have panned it in the past). They booked reservations for us, made recommendations and were very friendly. Breakfast was good, although it's not a large selection (cheeses, meats, yogurts, cereal and fresh fruit...no eggs made to order, etc.). My negatives were limited: our television was an old cheap 13\" bulky tube model which looked really out of place in an expensive modern hotel (some rooms apparently have small flat screens...ours did not). The carpet in our room, while really nice, apparently doesn't wear well as it had pilling all over it and needs to be replaced...which is a shame as it looked really expensive (berber?). Our drinking glasses in the room were replaced with dirty glasses after we used them. Finally, our room was on the 2nd floor which allowed us to hear some street noise (not much since we never opened the windows). I would've preferred a higher floor room, but the hotel was sold out. All in all, if you're a young traveller (or young at heart) who likes modern, large, clean rooms (basically W Hotel) and doesn't want to risk it with some dump, this is your hotel (albeit a bit expensive).
