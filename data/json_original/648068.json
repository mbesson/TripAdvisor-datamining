It is impossible to find for just two nights in high season a reputable chain hotel unles you stay in Salisbury. I knew that to be able to only book for that Saturday and Sunday nights there might be a few problems. Most of the bad reviews I had read were correct. The carpets and furnishings were well worn and the hallways did smell of urine. They do have luggage carts, however when you take the small elevator to the upper floors you cannot push it to your room as there are many up and down stairs on each level. We asked the front desk for help and they did send the maintenance man who knew how to get the cart to our room and he even took everything off and placed our luggage in our room. In the rooms you could see mold in various places, so if someone is a germaphobe beware. However, the front desk staff was extremely nice and helpful and you are steps away from the beach. So to be able to be oceanside for only a weekend in high season I would say it was worth our stay.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Old Bridge, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat value & friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Denise S", "ReviewID": "UR139523416", "Content": "This hotel was a typical beach hotel with friendly staff at the very end of the board.

As for the room, I'm sure it was clean but it felt kind of dirty. The water pressure in the shower was really poor. You could get more pressure from the sink and considering that most people are trying to rinse off sand from the beach this was disappointing.

The carpets were stained badly. The bed linens had holes in them. The balcony was dirty with the previous vacationers garbage on it and the floor of balcony was not swept. Seven months prior to our stay we reserved 2nd or 3rd floor oceanfront. They gave us room 101. We fussed, so they said stay in 101 then move to another room next day. How about this, how about keeping people's reservations and not stink up their whole vacation? LITERALLY! Please save your family's vacation and book elsewhere!

Anyway, we made our reservation in January for a July stay. I called to make sure we were getting a 2nd or 3rd floor oceanfront efficency and was assured that everything was all set up. We arrived a day early, got a room for one night and then our oceanfront room for the rest of the week. That place is the worst. It smells, the one elevator that they have is the size of a closet, and the hallways are so narrow that we could not push our luggage cart past the maid's cart. The room was very outdated and the floors were stained with who knows what. The bedding was very old and the mattresses were probably the original ones from the grand opening. It was one of those situations where you didn't want to look around because of what you might see. Most of the video games in the game room didn't work and the indoor pool looked kinda murky. There are different steps in different places throughout the upper floors on the north side of the building so if you end up with a room over there...you will be carrying all of your luggage...because the carts will be useless. They have 3 or 4 parking lots but they are not really convenient and one of them is on the other side of the main street. The next day, although we were very disappointed overall, we decided to stick it out...hoping that our oceanfront efficiency would be nicer. Well, they didn't have the room we reserved in January. They offered us a 1st floor oceanfront...that had plexiglass covering the balcony...so we would have to look through it to see the ocean. Then the following day they said that they may be able to get us into the room we reserved in January. I almost blew a gasket and instead demanded my deposit back.

The front desk staff was friendly, even when we had a small dispute (I thought we booked oceanfront, but when I reviewed the reservation, it did indeed say oceanview). The rooms were cleaned promptly every day, and the staff was courteous. Clearly this is no Marriott, but for a budget hotel on the boardwalk with an ocean view, it was suprisingly good. There was also a live reggae band that played each afternoon (not sure if that was just for Mem day wknd), so that added to the fun atmosphere. The pool and pool bar were packed and lively every afternoon with a younger crowd (early-mid 20s). There were also a lot of amenities that make it a good deal- game room with 80's video games like Ms Pacman, and they only cost 25 cents, just like the good old days.

I hate to give the Flagship an 'average' rating because we did have such a fun weekend, but the hotel is dated.

Balcony was large and beautiful all day with a nice breeze which felt refreshing! The hotel is located on 26th street and is at the end of the boardwalk but at the beginning of the Tram Service which is a big plus when you want to go to the \"real part of the boartdwalk.\" The service was great. Stafff VERY friendly with no complaints here from us at all. Very accomodating. Some of the bad, and they are bad! First, the parking absolutely STINKS. Small lot and a supplemental lot. Other than that, you have to get a spot on the side streets. GOOD LUCK!!! Also, our room was 306 and we went up the elevator with teh luggage cart full of our stuff only to find STEPS!! Yes, steps up (three of them) an dthen the hallway, then 3 more steps down and then another hallway. How the heck were we supposed to get the full cart up and down just to get to our room. The staff politely told us that it was only on one sid eo fteh building. To their credit, they DID offer a new room on the other side but THE NEXT DAY. We told them we didn't want to move after getting settled in since the room was fine. They sadi no problem with getting help when we check out. True to their word, we didn't have to go up any steps when checking out. The bell hops were great and did it for us but it was a pain!!! The inddor pool was a joke, so small!!! Although it was open 24/7 so you could take a quiet dip any hour of the night! Outdoor pool was nice! Fruit and coffe/hot chocolate any time of day was a nice touch too. Even though we had a non-smoking room, it DID smell a tiny bit of smoke. Don't know if that was from other rooms on the floor which allowed smoking or not! Showere water pressure was bad. For the price we paid a night, nearly $227 a nite, it was okay and we expected a lot more in terms of room comforts, etc but it WAS the heart of the season for Ocean City so I guess I would have paid a lot more per night at a more luxurious place.

The thing that keeps me coming back is that the staff is outstanding! Scott, at the front desk, is incredibly helpful and always makes sure I get the room and the location that I want. He knows exactly who I am when I call. Donna knows both my name and my son's name and takes such great care of us from the moment we check in until even after we have checked out. I also love how they always have fresh fruit waiting for you with the coffee in the lobby. The great thing about the way this hotel is situated, is that most of the rooms have a great view of the ocean. You overlook the pool area and the ocean from most or all of the rooms. They also have a great play area for the children, safely tucked inside the courtyard, that also has picnic benches. There is also a game room and a TV room in the middle of the hotel. I have stayed at outstanding hotels all over the U.S. I have to say that the service and friendliness, I have always experienced at this hotel, surpasses that of those 5 star locations. The hotel goes through new renovations each off-season, so if you came before and didn't like your room, you should ask to try one of the newly renovated ones. You won't find 5 star rooms here, but you won't pay for a 5 star room, either. The rooms are clean and well maintained and that's all I need when I am going to the beach. Personally, I am going to be out and about all day, enjoying the beach, pools, activities, restaurants, etc. Who cares about a fancy room that you have to pay tons of money for when you should be outside enjoying all that the area has to offer?

DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE MADE!!!!!!!!! I still gave this hotel a chance after reading the bad reviews. I always like to experience things on my own before joining the \"band wagon\".. whoosh.. should have taken it more seriously when someone has mentioned about the ac unit. Let me first start off saying that this hotel has the Best CS Reps. Everyone of their staff was pleasant. It's a BIG plus there. I was told at the time of booking that we will be getting the \"Deluxe\" Efficiency, Newly Renovated for less than a year. I expected the best!The size of the room sucks!, my heart dropped when I entered, I was very disappointed in what I saw. It was hot and musty up on the 3rd floor. I went over to feel the ac unit, it was blowing barely nothing. I called for maintenance right away. He came and took out the tank cleaned it and replaced a new filter. Supposedly that was the cause of it blowing the warm air. I was told to give the room a few hrs and it should cool down. Okay... My husband and I took the kids for a walk on the boardwalk, came back and it was still warm. Since we are the type of people that don't like to cause a lot of inconvenience to anyone, we put up with the warmth hoping that it will get better. Later I discovered that the stove was not working on two of the 4 ranges. Called for maintenance again, since we paid a bit just to have a kitchen I was a bit upset at this time. He came fixed it. I had to spend most of my time out on the balcony during the day where this would be the only place I would get some breezy air, while my kids and hubby are at the pool. By 11p.m the next day- I have to say by this time, the ac unit must have failed to give out any cool air for good. We could not sleep. My kids were crying tossing and turning, My little girl who is only 6 mos was swetting profusely. At this time I was def fired up, I went outside and sat there until 5 in the am. I think sleepin on the balcony was better than on the bed in that sono room. Got our stuff ready and checked out at 8 a.m. This was a very awful decision I ever made. Having to pay $269 per night should have been a bit better than this. Spinnaker Motel was even better.

So 2010, we stayed again. A lot has changed. In 07 they had a free breakfast which is now gone. The housekeeping came every day in 07, they didn't come in our room once in 10. In fact this year we had to put our dirty towel and trash outside the room for them to pick up. So if you don't mind sand being in your room all day, either request they clean or stay somewhere else. The air conditioning BLOWS!!!!! and not cold air. We were told if we come back to request a room on the lower levels because everyone on the third floor doesn't have good air. Needless to say we were there in the middle of the heatwave. Our TV was total static which sucked for my little ones. The maintence man came and did bring us a fan and a new TV which made us happy. So the staff did do their part to try to help us out. The second night, my mom tried to open the door to let us in and the whole handle fell off and she was trapped inside the room. I brought the door handle down to the desk and told her what happened and she laughted. Ok, third floor with ,my mom and a four and six year old in a room with a broken door....not funny. Fire hazard if you ask me. Again the maintence man had to come up again and he did fix the door but put the handle on upside down. Overall, it isn't a bad hotel for the price. There weren't any bugs, the room was clean except for the dishes, but we brought our own paper plates anyways. Will we stay there again....NO.

I myself dealt with the manager at night time, Scott. I had called him several days prior to coming to confront some of these other reviews. He told me like it was and also told me that if there was anything he could do to make my stay more comfortable just to ask. I did ask several times for several things (restaurant suggestions, toiletries, fun stuff to do, and just conversation about Ocean City.)

First the good..The location of the hotel is pretty decent its on 26th street just at the end of the boardwalk and it is basically right on the beach so you dont have to walk all that far. On the second floor they do have like a little arcade with a pool table and several different arcade games. On the third floor they had like a lounge with a decent size flat screen tv that we got to watch the hockey game on. The room was a decent size and it wasnt dirty or anything like that. We did get the room with the kitchen so there was a small fridge a microwave a stove and some dishes and a sink. The hotel staff seemed friendly but they didnt go out of their way to like say hi or anything like that, but not like i cared. Check in was at 3pm and we got there around 8am so we had to wait a while before our room was ready. Luckily they have an indoor pool and a hottub which they let us use and they also had a fitness center(which was a joke) and a tanning bed that i didnt get a chance to look at. Luckily the weather was decent so we got to lay out by the pool for a while as well. There is a bar out by the pool which i didnt get a chance to check out mainly because it was 9am and i pulled an all nighter to drive down there. When our room was finally ready it was decent like i said. It was supposed to be oceanfront and i mean you can see the ocean from the balcony from the room but its not a direct view. The courtyard they have is in a horseshoe shape but its not to bad i guess you can still see the ocean. Now the bad. The first thing we noticed was that there was virtually no water pressure in the shower. it took 15-20 minutes of messing with it and we finally improved it but the water temperature was either extremely hot or extremely cold. I went the hot route and thought my skin was going to melt off. The second day we could not get the shower to turn off so we had a maintenance man to the room and he kind of fixed it, it was alot more tolerable. then after that we went out for a while and came back and saw that the indoor pool had sprinklers goin all around it which was cool. The next day we wake up to find out that the indoor pool and hottub were closed do to maintenance and they didnt open til like 3. Also we looked outside to find the outdoor pool was being drained into the courtyard so that was flooded. The weather wasnt exactly the best so we stayed in the room for a majority of the day and went out around 5ish. The location again was good being that there are tons of resturants and places to go to. The maid did show up as we were waking up earlier in the day and we asked if she could come back later. She said that all we needed to do was put this service room please tag on the door. We did that but noone ever came back and the maid did not show up once during the entire trip so our room was never cleaned and we were forced to steal towels from the pool area. Checkout at this hotel is 11. we called down for a late checkout and they said we could stay til like 12 i believe or we could pay 30$ to stay til 6 which i did. Parking was not too bad i got a spot near the side entrance but then again we went from mon-wed and it was not crowded at all so i can only imagine how bad it gets when its busy. I believe there was also an all you can eat sea food buffet on the side of the building but we didnt go there. One other bad thing could be the walls not being all to thick. We didnt have anyone next door til the morning that we were leaving and we could basically hear everything that was said in the next room but they werent exactly going out of their way to keep it down which could be an inconvience for some. But yeah thats the trip in a nutshell overall i didnt mind the hotel but there is always room for improvement, i did no research at all in the booking of this trip it was spur of the moment and it was practically the first one i saw so im sure you could find a better hotel at a better rate if you really looked but overall i was satisfied. total came to like 228 for 2 nights.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Location": "5", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cDirty,Disgusting and smelly\u201d", "Author": "mariass21", "ReviewID": "UR30826284", "Content": "I stayed in flagship for memorial day weekend, What a nightmare!!

We were informed on the first night we were there that we were placed above the kitchen ...The hallways smelled like steamed crab and the kitchen staff likes to play their music so loud that we couldn't hear our TV! We called the front desk everynight to have them tell the restaurant to turn it off! They have some efficiency rooms, ours was one of them...When people cooked food in their rooms, it would stink up the entire hallway! I could smell fried eggs in the morning and fried hamburgers at night... All cheap smelling food, nothing good! Made me gag a little! People also propped their room doors opened so when you walked down the hallway you could, not only smell their nasty food, but you could look into their nasty room with underwear on the floor, unmade beds and whatever else! I didn't understand this concept as I have never been in a hotel where people did that kind of thing. Not sure even why they did it! The walls are insanely thin! You can hear everything. We were in a room that could adjoin with the one to the right of us and the person in the other room was actually trying to unlock the door and get into ours...TOTALLY weird!!!! Needless to say, we will not be staying at this hotel again...The staff was terrific and I feel really bad to give such a low rating just for their sake. They should all get jobs at the Hilton or something up the street as that really is the caliber of service they provided.

No screen door for Patio Door, no shower lining for shower curtain, I have not seen a green old fashion bathroom since late 1989/1990. The linen was old, dingy in color and wringed. Have not experience that in 20 years. The day after we arrived we were scheduled for a fishing trip--needed to be up at 5:00 A.M.

Needless to say, the Service called at 6:10 A.M. as we were departing our room for trip. Good thing I did not have a Conference that morning. Our room was on the 2nd Floor which we could only take the rolling butler to the Arcade Room on the 2nd Floor. We had to take our luggage and all other bags off the trolley, walk up two steps, walk down a very long hallway, down two steps and turn and go half-way down the hall to our room. We asked for a smoking room, but all signs on the door said non-smoking and no ash trays, however, front desk called and asked if the room was ok and I mentioned the non-smoking room and I was told that it was a smoking room and do not pay attention to the sign. Ash trays were not empty. I just did not feel clean in this accommodation. Also, the walls are thin and as well as the floor above where you could hear everything next door and above.

This hotel desperately needs major renovation.\u201d", "Author": "EricSStatenIslandNY", "ReviewID": "UR8263397", "Content": "Let me begin by saying that this used to be a Best Western property until it was recently sold and it doesn't look like new owners have any intentions of maintaining it never mind upgrading it. The whole place looks run down and poorly kept. We were fooled by Travelocity's three star rating and relatively low rates ($200 per night vs. $250 for most other chain hotels on the boardwalk ) Let me tell you, looking back I would spend the extra 50 bucks per night to get into Holiday Inn or similar. Check-in was fast and easy and parking is not a problem. However the lobby is very small, carpeting looks like it should have been replaced at least 10 years ago and there is only one elevator for the whole hotel. Our room (#116) upon entry smelled pretty bad and was smaller than we expected. Bathroom was poorly lit, fan was very loud but ineffective there is no safe. Comforters had some stains, mattresses rolled about and pillows were uncomfortable. TV had no HBO although listed in the channel line-up. Wireless internet service was spotty at best. Little or no connectivity was the message. In general. hotel staff was friendly except for our maid who asked us every morning if we wanted the room cleaned. It seemed like she just wanted us to stay in dirty rooms and use wet towels off the floor so she can take off early. There is no hotel restaurant and so obviously there is no room service. Beware because some websites are ambiguous about this fact because there is an independent restaurant downstairs (Jonah and the Whale) sublet by the hotel. It has a separate entrance. The hotel does offer continental breakfast in the lobby featuring some of the world\u2019s worst case. There is no seating area and the lobby sign advises you to enjoy outside seating but to get there you have to walk through indoor pool over slippery floors. The entire layout of the hotel is very strange to say the least. For example to get to the outdoor pool you have to also go through indoor pool. which is on the street level so when sit there you're basically staring at the cars passing by just a few feet away. The gym is a joke it\u2019s a small room with two old treadmills and two out four only weight machines not working. There are no barbells or dumbbells at all. There is no public restrooms in the lobby, guess what - it's also outside once you navigate your way through some disgusting laundry area. Men's room was out of order - the door was covered up with some dirty old chairs. Ladies' bathroom had no running water ! Outdoor pool is decent size but dirty. Pool steps have a huge hole in the floor where an old handrail used to be based. Nobody ever bothered to fill it. There is no running water anywhere as you enter the pool area from the sandy beach so naturally all the sand winds up in the pool which I haven't seen cleaned. Pool bar is okay but separated by long prison-like bars. Speaking of which. the whole pool area is surrounded by long bars so it looks a lot like a prison yard. :) The bar is only open from 11 am to 5 pm Drinks were acceptable and not expensive $4-$5 and It also offered junk food but we didn't dare try. One more positive that I found was the 40 cent soda in the soda machine so you can count on that. In conclusion, the only reason we rated our overall experience Okay was because we were really lucky with weather, spent a lot of time on the beach and really liked OC area with all its' restaurants and activities. This was our first time and we will definitely be back but never in a million years will we stay at Flagship even if it cost $99 per night. If you have the time look for a different hotel in this price range or move up to a higher class accommodations. By the way. this is the first time I ever bothered to write a review.

We love the location (right on the boardwalk facing the ocean). We love that there is a nice outdoor pool, and our kids love the indoor pool / hot tub. Since the first time we stayed here, we knew it wasn't the best hotel......the first year we had a tub that wouldn't drain and took several hours to drain all of the water. The next couple of years there was no big problem.....just not the cleanest place. Last year the bigger problems began. A fire alarm sounded around maybe 10 p.m. My husband and I grabbed our two children and went to the lobby where everyone was allowed to stand / sit until the okay was given to return to our rooms. We were frightened by the whole thing, but we were told it was nothing to worry about....they thought a problem at the restaurant which is connected to the building......no fire, nothing to worry about. Then, several hours later, we were awakened from deep sleep with another fire alarm. This time our whole family was very scared and this time fire trucks came, and everyone had to leave the building in pajamas / whatever you had time to throw on. I actually saw two people trip / fall because of the rush to get downstairs and out of the building. Our children were traumatized because of the commotion. They also were crying because in the rush we left their blankies / stuffed animals in the beds. We were outside between a half hour and an hour I think around 2 or 3 a.m. From that night on, we had to pack a bag of blankets, dolls, cherished items each night before we could go to bed in case it happened again. My 4 year old daughter made me hold her hand every night in bed for at least a half an hour before she could relax and fall asleep. We were told this whole commotion was not the hotel's fault.........it was again the restaurant which had dish washers running and the heat made the alarm go off. We were never offered any discount although our sleep was interrupted twice and it affected us and our children throughout the rest of the stay. The restaurant never offered any free meal / discount for the hotel guests either. Against our better judgement, we decided to give the hotel one last chance this year. Again, we chose it because of the great location and the pools. This year when my husband called to make a reservation, the person talked him into paying a little extra each night to have a balcony that faced the ocean....the other rooms give you a partial view of the ocean, but more of a view of the pool or picnic table / shuffleboard area. As soon as we walked into this room my whole family said, \"What's that smell?\" We never did find out, but it wasn't a good smell. The view was nice, but our balcony had what looked like ashes all over it. We had friends and family staying at different hotels at the same time, so I decided to let them know we had arrived, but our phone had no dial tone. We reported the problems to the front desk. They immediately sent somebody up to take care of it. The ashes were swept off the balcony, but the phone was a bigger problem. The man came back three times, but couldn't fix the phone. He said he told his boss, and the boss told him the phone company would be out first thing in the morning to fix it. Well, by the third day, the phone still hadn't been addressed! I went to the front desk and complained again. I was told that I should go back up to my room and try it again because it wasn't turned on in their board. I did that, but it still didn't work, so I trudged back downstairs again. This time I was told that they would change my room. I didn't want to change my room after spending two nights in the room with the better view (even though it did smell funny!) I complained that I was having to use my cell phone (no free minutes) to make local calls that should have been free according to what the hotel advertises. I was told that she'd tell the manager, and that we could use the front desk phone in the meantime. This was very inconvenient as our room was probably as far away from the front desk as you can get. I just continued to use my cell phone. Nobody ever fixed the phone during our entire stay, a manager never addressed the issue, and they did not refund us any money. I am not a person to make a big scene over anything in order to get money back even when I think I deserve it. We checked out without complaining anymore. We just wanted to leave and head home.

We paid an exorbitant amount of money for an oceanfront efficiency with an indoor pool. The oven door could not open so was virtually unusable. There was a cockroach in the bathroom. Most of the staff was unfriendly and not helpful. There was one exception, a very nice gentleman who gave us advice where to eat, and the maid was sweet. The indoor pool is the size of a postage stamp. Long long walk to the door. Cheap linens. I can go on and on. I will never go back.

It was a wonderful experience. Everything was clean and neat and the staff was so friendly and helpful. My room had a new bathroom and it felt like new beds. I slept so well. :) I even had a chance to talk with the General Manager at the front desk and he was very friendly and helpful. I told him what a nice room I had and how nice my stay was. :) I didn't have a chance to swim in the indoor pool or hot tub...but I went in and looked around and was very impressed with the cleanliness and that it was open 24 hours a day. I am hoping to get back there for another visit soon and am hoping to be able to use the pool and hot tub. I would highly recommend this hotel and it is very convenient to the boardwalk and everything that Ocean City has to offer.

I was almost afraid to close my eyes. No security. Very long hallways to have to carry your luggage. Don't think using a cart will help. You can only go a few feet before you have at least two or three steps. The TV was broken, the microwave didn't work, and the refrigator was also broke. It was all I could do to get the balcony door open. My oceanview room meant that if I stepped out onto the balcony (if I could get the door open, that is), and looked to my left, sure enough I could see the ocean. The last few days of our stay, the pool, hot tub, fitness room and tanning bed were closed because of glass breakage. The breakfast each day consisted of rotten bananas or donuts. No milk. Only juice.

I stayed at multiple hotels and multiple times at this Best Western. I've stayed at the typical guest room and suite room (4 different rooms so far). Every room smells! As do the lobby/corridor/parking lot. In the parking lot, there is a puddle of water from the dumpster every day! No one cleans it. (and i've been staying there for 3 weeks now) There were also bug (not fruit flies but similar) in the restrooms of two of the rooms and just disgusting! Service isn't too bad. One of the rooms had a broken TV... Any button on the remote would turn the tv on or off. Can't change channels, can't adjust volume. Just on and off... But that was in one of the suites with two tv's so i just watched tv in the bedroom... In conclusion: Even if you plan on spending 90% of your time outside this hotel, I would still not recommend it.

The room did smell like smoke a little but after having the door open while unpacking, it went away. The only complaint I can think of was the hot water. It was actually scolding, but we flushed the toilet and that helped alot. As far as the hotel goes, yes it is out dated, but who really spends alot of time looking at the hotel.

Even at this amazing rate, I would not stay there again. At the very least, I need to be able to sleep where I am staying.
