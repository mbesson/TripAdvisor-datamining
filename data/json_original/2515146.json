They did discount our room rate, which was appreciated, but did not make up for the miserable cold night.

The computer system also went down a few times during the afternoon, delaying check in for many other guests. To be fair, they then upgraded us to a suite, but it did not make up for very disappointing stays.

Further, the gym is in horrible working condition. I tried 3 different treadmills.

We were there for 3 nights and the first night the 20 somethings that occupied the room next to us felt they needed to come home at 1:30am and share the entire night out they just had with all that would hear as they were yelling and laughing and slamming doors. The positive was that after we called security (the came up within 3 mins) they were quiet. They had moved elsewhere but when they returned an hour and a bit later they were loud again but only for a short time. Our second night was wonderful. The party crowd checked out and we had a great sleep until the last night when they checked in a young couple with a newborn that screamed ALL NIGHT til 3 am. They really need to think about where they place people especailly when the hotel is not even close to being full and we specifically requested a quiet room since we have experienced similar issues in the past. Do not put a baby next us if there is a chance it may scream all night. It's like going into a resturaunt that's almost empty and they seat you next to the rowdiest table in the place. A little common sense would be great.

The agreement was that the bride had to pay a percentage of the un-booked blocked rooms to cover the losses incurred by the hotel, but the night of the wedding we had 3 guests from our party turned away and then the bride's mother was told that not all rooms were booked. Strange? That, and the 'discounted' booking rate was $280 a night, plus $39 a night for parking. Yikes! We had also given the front desk around 60 gift bags to give to the guests who checked into our blocked rooms - only one couple confirmed receiving a gift bag. Not entirely sure what happened to the rest of them. The room that was booked for the bride and myself the night before the wedding was not much larger than a closet, however, the suite her and the groom were given for the night of the wedding was actually very nice. Not sure what the deal is with the see-through bathroom doors though - awkward! Other than all of that, this hotel really was in a great location. Right on 5th Avenue with plenty of coffee shops around and within walking distance of Pike's Place Market. The hotel bar/restaurant Elephant and Castle was a pretty good place to hang out also. The restaurant upstairs was also great for breakfast. I have to give a shout out to the bartender there - the bar was not yet open because it was their 'continental'-style breakfast going on, but we had all partied so hard after the wedding the night before I NEEDED a bloody mary - he opened the bar for me and made all of us the best bloody mary's.

We weren't the only ones waiting, and found out other guests had similar problems; one person remarked the staff was arrogant. Finally given a room at 3:45pm; 15 minutes before we were to be picked up for another event. Each time we asked if the room was ready (room number given to us right away), we were told the same excuse; the hotel was full and housekeeping was trying to catch up. If you have guests waiting in the lobby, wouldn't you try and get those rooms done first? Around 3:30 pm, from our vantage point in the lobby, we heard other guests being told to wait; as the rooms weren't ready yet. One lucky person walked right up to the desk with her luggage and as given a room right away. She hadn't been waiting at all, so some rooms were getting cleaned; just not for those waiting over 2 hours. As the week wore on, we noticed this happened every day; luggage overflowing at the Bell Captain's desk from guests not being to check in. Nothing was given to us or others for the inconvenience. If you can't honor your guests early check-in/arrival, take the option off your web site/reservation. But its also a major problem if check-in is at 3 pm and you can't even honor that time. Does mean we don't have to check out until 2 pm? Having gotten up at 4:30 am (1:30 am Seattle time) and traveling all day, siting in a lobby is the last thing anyone wants to endure. The location was great and the room was really nice; price wasn't that good. Next time we will look for another hotel or rent a house.

There was a lovely container of ice water with strawberries and cucumbers in the lobby, but there was hardly any water left and with all the people waiting, it ran out. We didn't get to our room until 5pm. Ice was on even floors so I went to the 8th floor only to find the ice machine was out of order. Our room had a peek-a-boo view of Elliott Bay. A few floors higher would have made for a great view. The beds were very comfortable and it was nice to have a refrigerator in the room. However, there was a big wet spot on the carpet where someone had spilled something and the window had a big lipstick stain on it. I had hoped the room would be cleaner. At breakfast the next morning, we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated and I was not impressed with their buffet. There was an interesting pancake machine, sausage links, bacon, homestyle potatoes, two kinds of scrambled eggs, a few breads and cereals and juice. Most of the time they were out of something, so it didn't seem like there was much to offer. While we got our food, they gave our table away and we had to get another one. We did have a friendly server named Nicole, who brought coffee and we had fun talking with her. At check-out, the room cost $277 once taxes were added. It seemed like a lot to pay for a hotel that needs to get their act together.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, AL", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, value and hotel\u201d", "Author": "Phillips66", "ReviewID": "UR109888506", "Content": "Spent two nights here and what a great choice. !

This is a hotel that has seen better days, I'm guessing. The lighting inside was very poor, especially in the bath. TV channel selection: the worst I've seen in years. Forget HBO, etc.; you can't even get CNN or PBS. Service? How about no newspapers at all, even the local papers, anywhere in the building on weekends. So you go ask the concierge for help on a Saturday? The concierge is gone till Monday. When I got there, there was a convention checking out. One clerk, 30 mins plus wait. Worst of all, or maybe best of all: we moved out after one night--a rare event for us--and cancelled the rest of our reservation, then we got a room for the same price at the Fairmont Olympia, a top of the line property. Same price. It baffles me why anyone would knowingly choose the Red Lion. We did it because my wife was there on a conference, and we decided to stay there afterward. It's too bad because they have a good location, and with some work and a lower price, they could be ok. They seem to be clueless about the deficiences. Or maybe they're not.

We chose a \"Deluxe View - King room. They said it was on a certain floor or higher (20 floor building) and the rooms have a Bay view.

The lobby was nicely decorated for Christmas still and the real tree filled the lobby with a wonderful scent. Room was on the 18th floor, with a great view and very nice furnishings. The rooms have been wonderfully updated...sleek and modern, yet warm in color and finishes. The View: there are a few buildings between hotel and water, but we were high enough to enjoy ferry traffic and a partial view of Pike Place Market. Next time we\u2019ll request the best view of the market, too. The lights at night are beautiful and the bustle of the morning routine was fun to watch. There is little to no city noise. The elevators are fast and caused some white noise in the room, but did not keep us up (we were the closest room to the elevators). I read some complaints about loud neighbors, but we heard no one. Room was very quiet & comfortable...lots of walking room and storage. The bed was a little soft for us (pillow top), but did not wake up sore. Bedding is high quality. Refrigerator in room was great to keep leftovers in. The iPod docking station was great...we streamed Pandora with free Wi-Fi, so we had just the music we wanted. The bathroom had Bath & Body Works items...awesome. The bathroom felt like a mini spa.

Next morning, we enjoyed the buffet; lots of hot items to choose from and helpful wait staff.

Great value for the price. Cons: Walls alittle thin, could hear room next door coming back at midnight. Bathroom is clean and updated but alittle small.

The shower had great water pressure too, which I always find a plus when you want to scrub the airplane feeling off! Conference facilities were adequate and the food at both breakfast and lunch was very good. I would stay away from the box lunches though, which did not seem fresh at all. Too bad, as everything else was great! The attached pub is also nice for a drink in the evening and is large enough to accomodate big groups, although the service was a bit slow (one bartender for a place with 40-50 people in it is not enough!). There is also a business center, somewhat awkwardly located in a separate building, but you can print boarding passes here for free. The staff of the hotel was pleasant enough, but I wouldn't say especially friendly or helpful. In fact, the concierge was actually quite rude at one point. Why bother having a surly concierge?

Very roomy with king sized bed, desk/chair, reading chair w/footstool but the reading light was not bright enough. The bathroom was nice with good lighting but the water from the shower head only sprayed out from the outter perimeter and not the center so rinsing the shampoo out of my hair was a bit of a challenge. The bathroom door has a large frosted glass panel so you can see the person inside sitting on the toilet or wiping themselves off out of the shower. That is strange and posed a bit uncomfortable for my 13 year old son and his grandmother who where roommates. The business center is across a breezeway, then downstairs which could be uncomfortable for a woman alone. There were four of five computers which are free for printing airline tickets. For the internet, the first few minutes were free then your CC is charged. Don't recall how much since we didn't use it. The front desk staff were nice but the concierge, yikes! The first day I noticed the concierge just sitting at the desk staring out the door looking totally bored. In fact he looked as if he was about to fall asleep. When I asked him about a particular store, he simply said it had closed years ago, no smile. No suggestions of other places I might be intrested in, no giving of a map or anything. The next day there was a different guy but he looked equally bored. They really need to have these guys actually doing something so they at least looked busy or better yet, they need better people for the job. There is a restaurant downstairs which serves a buffet breakfast, STAY AWAY! Ugh, for $12.95 it was awful. The pancakes were freshly made via a machine which was okay but don't expect fluffy pancakes as those were flat. The scrambled eggs were not good so I didn't finish them. The fruits were floating in water so I didn't bother with them but my mother said they were tasteless. The other selections were bacon, sausage, muffins, cereal, for the money this so called buffet was not worth it. The juices were too sweet even my teenager commented on it.

I was told they needed to be cleaned and would I like to wait or receive rooms on different floors. Their estimated wait time of 30 minutes turned into almost two hours. When we arrived at the rooms they were next to each other without an inside adjoining door. I called down to reception and was informed that they had no adjoining rooms in the hotel, and when they said \"adjoining\" they just meant \"next to.\" Seriously? They did not clarify this at any time, though several calls and front-desk chats, and we would not have waited almost two hours for rooms without an inside door. The accommodations themselves had old, noisy climate controls and nice flat-screen TVs with no DVD player or pay movies, though they did have an iPod docking station. The cable channels on the TV were grainy. The bathrooms were clean and the towels plentiful. Since it was the holidays, they had cookies and warm cider in the lobby, but not all evening.

Check-in was very competent and pleasant; I had sent myself a package and was notified immediately upon check-in that it was waiting for me. Our 11th floor room was roomy and comfortable enough, with two queen beds and a view of Puget Sound and, when the clouds lifted, Bainbridge Island in full Fall glory beyond. Lighting was notably insufficient. On the other hand, the wi-fi is free and dependable. The beds were comfortable, but the sheets had major issues: (see photo) and threatened every night to come unmoored. The pillows were too high and firm. Once we figured out the apparently uncalibrated thermostat had to be set at about 80o, the room temperature was comfortable. The closet door is on an inconvenient auto-closer but the hangers are real wood, on real hooks, thank you very much. There are also two big fluffy robes in that closet. In the room are: a hair dryer, the usual coffee maker and packets of icky coffee (who needs that in Seattle!), iron and board, fancy clock radio, a big flat-screen TV (with 46 channels listed but only about 25 available, of which about six were sports, and a couple in Spanish). There is also a very convenient dorm-sized fridge for cooling your own food and drinks, but no mini-bar. We found it to be essentially a quiet hotel, except for some periodic mysterious mechanical rumblings like little gremlins bowling in the ventilation system. The bathroom has the same hang-tags as everyplace these days: if you are willing to re-use your towels, hang them up on a rack, blah-blah. Indeed, the housekeepers did not take away our towels (but helpfully, did leave us fresh ones), which we were happy to use for a couple of days, but there is nothing resembling a functional towel rack in the bathroom, in favor, alas, of trendy d\u00e9cor and uninteresting art. This is my plea to all hotels: skip the art, please give us enough feet of towel rack so we can hang \u2018em up to dry!! Hot water was quickly forthcoming and pressure was adequate. The vanity is pretty granite, but the lighting could have been better. We used the parking garage under the hotel. The rate is $30 (plus tax) with in-out privileges. Take a look at your charges before checkout. We were billed for all five nights we stayed in the hotel even though we used only two garage nights. The front desk readily made the correction, commenting that the garage is run by a concessionaire and that they often make such mistakes. Oddly, the Red Lion\u2019s full-service Terrace Garden restaurant on the fifth floor was not listed in the guest directory in our room. My one meal there, breakfast, was enjoyable (though not especially cheap), the service quick, and the coffee good. However, beware the \u201cgrapefruit juice.\u201d It was watery and sweetened, i.e., grapefruit drink. I told waitress I was disappointed, and all she said was, \u201cOh, it\u2019s Ocean Spray something-or-other\u201d (really!) instead of apologizing. It would have been more appropriate to take it off my bill, but not worth making an issue of. Speaking of food, a great alternative for breakfast, lunch, or a light dinner, is Specialty\u2019s, bakery/deli/sandwich/coffee shop across the street, on the corner of Fifth and Union. They offer very good sandwiches made to order on excellent bread (try the turkey and cranberry on herb bread!), all kinds of muffins and cookies, soups, and the like, eat-in or take-out, very reasonably priced. On the suggestion of the front desk clerk, we made our way to Gambas, a \u201cJapanese-French\u201d restaurant, for first rate sushi one evening. On another evening we went down to the Waterfront and had an amazing clam bake at Ivar\u2019s. Both these eateries are seafood *heaven* Of course at Pike Place Market there are dozens of places to eat anything your heart, or stomach, might desire. Don\u2019t skip the experience of strolling around the market\u2013allow a couple of hours at least. It\u2019s glorious!

The bathrooms were reasonably sized, and they featured Bath and Body Works products in popular scents. There were a few negatives, but they were not deal breakers for me. The biggest would be that the climate control was finicky. When we first arrived, we could not get it to turn on, so I had to call the front desk, who said they would turn it cooler. Later that night it was still having problems, but the desk this time suggested turning the knob all the way to the coldest setting and then back a few notches. (It was just a switch on the wall, not an actual window system, as prevalent in many hotels.) While it did cool off later, the room often felt stuffy when we returned from being outside.

Other things were the dirty exterior windows with bird poop streaking down them. Also, the toilet was difficult to flush and the handle had to be held down hard for a long time to flush. Also, the room was poorly lit, with at least 2 lights not working and not able to be fixed, since it was due, according to the maintenance man, to a faulty wiring job when the hotel was remodeled. So, we had a hard time reading in the evening, and it was depressingly dim. On the first day, two of the four elevators were not working, so there were long lines at the elevators. I spent over twelve hundred dollars for the 5 nights, and when I checked out, when asked how I liked my stay, I told the receptionist I would never again go to a Red Lion Hotel, and it was worth only $100 a night.

Downtown Seattle is fairly compact, and is well-serviced by (free) bus routes on most of its avenues and many of its streets. The hotel is within walking distance of many sites and nice restaurants. (My wife and I discovered the cafe at Macy's, about a five minute walk, was excellent for breakfast or lunch, with tasty and reasonably-priced sandwiches and soup, and quick and efficient service. The service at the Red Lion was excellent, especially the front desk, which went above and beyond the call of duty when I had problems printing out boarding passes for our return flight home. The room, for which we paid a small extra amount, was on a high floor with a delightful view of Elliott Bay and the arriving and departing Washington State Ferries. The king bed had excellent linens, a decent-sized work desk, and an easy chair. It also had a small fridge and a coffee maker. The bathroom was a tad small, but one usually doesn't live in the bathroom. The shower was adequate in terms of hot water and water pressure. The only negative about the room was the table lamps on the nightstans, which could use higher capacity light bulbs. I didn't bring my laptop, but I believe that wireless access has a daily charge. The hotel is a five minute walk from the Sheraton Hotel, where one can get on or off the airporter bus. The latter is $18 for a roundtrip, and if you have a little extra time is well worth the savings over an airport taxi if you have a party of two or fewer. (The bus will take you about 45\" to/from the airport, about 15-20\" more than a taxi; the bus runs every half hour.) As leisure activity we would certainly recommend the Museum of Art, but would suggest you skip the Olympic Garden, which was underwhelming at best. The Happy Hour at The Brooklyn Restaurant was excellent - good and inexpensive drinks and food, good service, and a happy, noisy but not raucus atmosphere. (Based upon the Happy Hour food I would think the restaurant, which is of the fine dining class, would be an excellent choice for either seafood or beef.)

The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. The hotel is in a great location in downtown Seattle. You can walk to tons of restaurants, shops, bars, etc. The hotel is on in a main area, so you can feel safe knowing you're not on some deserted side street. There is parking under the hotel, which is $25/night. It seems expensive, but we didn't see anywhere else to park. There is a small loading/unloading area right in front of the hotel. But, if you plan to keep your car there, you should go straight into the garage. The rooms have a small fridge, coffee maker, and a bar/sink area. We stayed there for 7 days, and one of the nights there was a fire in the kitchen. So, at 4am we had to evacuate the hotel. The hotel has an intercom system that the fire dept used to let us know to evacuate (plus there was a loud alarm). We got clear directions of exactly what to do through the intercom. The hotel provided coffee and food for us while we were waiting for the 'ok' to go back up to the rooms. Even though it sucked having to be jolted out of bed b/c of a fire alarm, you should rest assured that if something was seriously wrong with the building, you would know about it and be able to get out. My only complaint would be the expensive parking.

Located on Fifth Avenue (who knew?) between Pike and Union, this properties biggest benefit is it's location. Only 5 blocks from Pike's Market, and surrounded by shopping and places to eat. Oh, and if you like coffee, be careful, there are only approximately 3 coffee shops per square inch, so you may have to stock up between footsteps. The room was on the small side, but not unexpected of hotels in big cities, where room count is a question of economics. The other bad part of the room is that it had thin walls. The wireless internet access was free and decent, but had sporradic issues at times. Parking in the underground lot is $25.00 per day (plus a couple bucks in taxes), and you are free to come and go as you please. Just make sure the front desk is aware that you will be using the parking garage so they can get you the proper tags. If you book through an airline that you print your own boarding pass, be advised the business center charges $4.95 for 15 minutes, and $.49 per page to print. (I think it was $1.49 for color). The pillows were understuffed down pillows, something I'm not a big fan of, but even my wife thought they were too soft. The bed was medium firm. The room had adequate heating (we didn't try the A/C, it was cold enough as it was). The blackout curtains did a pretty good job. Water pressure and flow was pretty good. We didn't note any draining or filling problems. The Terrace restaurant was closed for remodeling while we were there, so I can't comment on it's quality. There is an English styled pub called the Elephant & Castle that is attached that was good quality. (Though they were lacking in a good selection of English brews at the time) All in all, it was a pretty good hotel at the price we paid ($80.00/per night, plus fees/taxes). I was really satisfied with the hotel at the price, but the normal price seems to be around $180/night, which I would have been furious at, as the value was nowhere near $180/night, especially when you have to add parking.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "hi", "Title": "\u201cNice room but beware of phony telephone charge!\u201d", "Author": "hdt", "ReviewID": "UR6570512", "Content": "I stayed here on business trip for several days.

The bad: 1. The supposed wireless Internet access did not work in my room, which was a serious problem because I was there on business, and I needed to stay in touch with the office during my stay. When I told the front desk staff (multiple times, because it never got fixed), each staff member told me a slightly different story about how to access it. They all guaranteed me their way would work, but it never did. Eventually, a manager told me to call tech support to report a problem with their wireless coverage. Why it was my responsibility to report their problem, I don't know, but I just didn't have the time to call. Tip: go to the Juan Valdez coffee shop right next to the hotel if you need to get online. Access is free, and the environment is nice. 2. Upon checkout, the front desk did not split up the bill the way my roommate and I asked to have it split up. They split it up their own way without asking us how to do it, and then told us they couldn't change it because it was already done. To make a long story short, my roommate ended up spending about $150 more than me (even though we wanted the bill split up evenly), and she will not be able to get reimbursed by her employer for that extra amount. 3. The shower drain was very slow. Minor compared to #1 and #2, but I just don't like wading in a pool of dirty water while I'm trying to clean up. 4.

My wife and I both commented it would be a $500 room in New York. Very roomy, clean. Free high speed internet. Bathroom was a B; totally functional, a bit in need of updating, but well above average.

Front desk agents were semi rude especially with the whole \"priceline\" package ordeal. Several comments were made about \"priceline\". Their restaurant on the 5th floor was nice and had a great server (his name I can not recall, but he was a younger sweet boy that catered to our requests). The bellman was extremely nice, so were two of the hotel operators (Terry and Goldy). The male concierge was also very nice and extremely friendly. The front desk didn't really cater to younger people, their first priority was their convention guest and older couples. Overall Seattle was amazing. The hotel was nice.
