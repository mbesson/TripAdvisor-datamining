It is located about 4 miles from downtown NOLA, and is only a few blocks from an I-10 exit. The motel itself is charming from the front, as it has wrought iron railings to give the place a French Quarter vibe. You park under the rooms (no rooms on ground floor), and in addition to parking you find gardens and a small pool on the ground floor. The woman at the front desk when I arrived and the guy there when I checked out after two days were extremely friendly and welcoming. They made me feel good. Now for the not as good. My room looked as if it hadn't been remodeled since 1975. Very retro, but not in a cool way. But on the other hand, it seemed clean, the a/c worked fine, and I loved the mattress. The tv was ok. But if you don't need good decor, then it is fine. The area around this motel is pretty scary looking. The multi-story building right next to the motel has been abanded for some reason, and has broken windows, etc. But the motel is surrounded by a tall fence with barbed wire at the top, and there are multiple guards roaming the grounds at night, so I (a woman traveling alone) felt perfectly safe there. Also, the motel is gated, and the gates on one side are locked at night--I suppose so that the guards don't have to watch both sets of gates at night. I didn't try the free breakfast, so can't speak to that. I'd have no problem staying at this motel again. I paid $54 per night with my discount coupon. I did see that there is a Motel 6 just a few blocks down the road that charges $45 or so, and I might also want to check it out, as it is even cheaper and maybe in a slightly better location (near a McDonald's and some other restaurants).

The staff are absolutely fantastic. They couldn't do more to help us - they gave us advice on buses to catch, how to get around town, they called us cabs and couldn't have been more helpful. Tira (?) was fantastic to us, even calling to confirm a taxi for us so we didn't have to! Breakfast is ok. There is juice and tea or coffee to drink. Two choices of cereal, pastries as well as a waffle maker which made great waffles with maple syrup to put on them - it would have been nice if some fruit was on offer just so we could feel a little healthy! The room was large and we had two double beds which were very comfy with clean bedding (even mattress protectors) to give us a good nights sleep. You could tell it was older accommodation as the noise when you flushed the toilet, shook the whole room. The walls are thin as we could hear people above and below us as well as people walking past our room. It was very busy at the time though as the basketball finals were on in new Orleans - which we weren't aware of at the time! There was free wifi in the room which was great for us! Location is the main drawback as it is far out. You couldn't walk into the city from the hotel. You could get a bus from opposite the hotel which costs $3 for A whole day pass - you will need to change onto a street car once you get to canal street. Taxis cost about $20 - there were two of us each way. The hotel have a shuttle driver who charges $10 per person to take you in. A great start to our road trip overall!

It turned out to be a good choice, for it was a comfortable stay and the staff obviously put a lot of effort into making it a quality establishment. When we left they even had staff doing work in the garden. The room itself was good, with two beds, a fridge and coffee maker. Amazingly, the wifi also worked in the room, which I found to be something of a rarity for places in this price range. The floor sloped slightly downwards, which was a bit odd, but it didn't matter at all. There is plenty of parking, even if the spaces are quite tight. The motel is equipped with a gym, which I didn't use, plus an outdoor pool, which looked quite good but was far too cold when I was there. The business center was very useful, for I was able to print out flight tickets. Breakfast was good (though waffles would enhance it!), but was packed away promptly at 9:30. It was good to fill up in the morning while watching the news before going into New Orleans for the day. That brings me to the location - it's not in an area that you'd want to walk around, but isn't too far from fast food places and is very close to the interstate, so it's easy to get into New Orleans itself. A lot of the motels in New Orleans are in this area.

Good accommodations for a short stay in New Orleans. However, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend this hotel if you do not have your own transportation; or if you would rely on public bus to get around New Orleans. TRAVEL DATES: April-2009 LOCATION: Situated across the bridge from downtown New Orleans; Easy access to I-10. The French Quarter is approximately 15 minutes away. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of restaurant on the same street, a couple of blocks from the hotel, primarily fast food restaurants. The area gets really crowded especially on weekends. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend getting your food to go and eat it in your room. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safer that way. POSITIVE NOTES: Good for a short stay in NOLA; Parking is somewhat secure. NEGATIVE NOTES: The surrounding area within a mile radius of the hotel is not too promising. A type of neighborhood where you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to have car trouble, or walk at night from the bus stop. The hotel and the surrounding neighborhood are frequented by party goers during weekends. We checked-in on a weekday and checked-out on a Sunday, and witnessed an influx of party goers. AMENITIES: Free Continental Breakfast, Free Wi-Fi, Micro/Fridge, Coffee Maker, Hairdryer; Swimming Pool NIGHTLY RATE: Low $70s after applicable taxes DISCOUNT ACCEPTED: None. I booked my accommodations online via Travelocity where I was able to secure it for a slightly lower price. HELPFUL TIP: I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend staying at this hotel if you are relying on getting around by public bus. The surrounding area of the hotel doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look safe walking around at night from the bus stop, especially if you have children. However, you should be fine if you are planning to travel by taxi, or better yet, if you have your own transportation. Do not get the room near the stairwell adjacent to the swimming pool area. People always congregate in that vicinity. They tend to be real noisy and annoying. Request for a room located on the opposite side of the wing.

We had a super day in town, felt like we really left no stone unturned, and all on the cheap, thanks to him. Thing is, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that we were special.

I don't normally stay in motels...well, because they're motels...but since I wanted to experience New Orleans for the 1st time for a couple days before my cruise departed from there, and it just so happened to be Jazz Fest at the time, the hotels were 3-4 times the normal cost. I didn't want to pay the high cost being that I wasn't there for Jazz Fest, and wanted to be able to splurge while on my cruise, so given the positive reviews we stayed here. This is a great motel, I really felt as if I was having a hotel experience! We stayed in a room with 2 beds on the 3rd floor and it was plenty of space for us, and it didn't have an old look or feel to it. It basically looks just like it does online. Personally I think the rooms are equivalent or bigger than a standard room at the Hyatt for a mere fraction of the cost. The customer service was exemplary; whenever we needed a cab to take to the French Quarter (about a 10- 15 min. taxi ride, approx cost $15/$16), we merely told the front desk and they called one for us each and every time with no problem. We'd go to the front desk and it request it there and wait because the taxis show up very promptly. They have a business center where you can use their computer and internet for free and use their printer for free. I needed to fax something and that was also free, you just present them with the documents and they fax it behind the counter and give your documents right back to you. You can also request them to print out the fax confirmation, also free of cost. They have free hearty continental breakfast, a free exercise room, snack and drink vending (at cost) and ice machines, and local calls are free from your room. I don't think the neighborhood is bad, it's just not a residential or business type of neighborhood; not sure how to describe it; somewhat industrial maybe, and the building that was a hotel right next door to the Super 8 was never renovated or knocked down after Hurricane Katrina so that may give it a bit of a rough appearance, but not much; it's very tolerable. A taxi driver told me the destroyed building used to be a Holiday Inn and it was just never fixed or bull dozed. There aren't any restaurants within walking distance from what I can tell, and no room service, but the motel has menus they provide you with of food places that deliver. One was an extremely economical chinese food place which delivers take-out and they gave me so much food, at least 2 or 3 people can feed off an order for one. I think the other place may have been a pizza delivery restaurant, but I didn't try it. I was really impressed by the level of service I received given that it's a motel. It turned out to be a very enjoyable experience. There is one thing that is odd, but not at all bad. The motel is raised above ground as you can see from their online pics, and every once in a while it feels like it rocks. I'm not sure if it's from a strong wind or what, but it's a unique thing to experience, but not at all frightening.
