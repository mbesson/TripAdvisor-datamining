The parking valets especially were so helpful. Our room came with free breakfast, which consisted of the usual cereals, breads and waffles, and also Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches which really hit the spot. The staff in the breakfast area was constantly moving, whether cleaning vacated tables or re-stocking empty items. And everyone we encountered along the way was very friendly.

Right in the heart of the inner harbor, very close to the waterfront, little italy, market place, etc. Price is right, though.

They offer Valet Parking for $30 a night, which we decided to utilize because to park elsewhere was $18 a night, so for just $12 more, Valet was a better option because it was so much easier. We didn't make it to the continental breakfast, but upon checking out, we asked the valet where a good place to park was while we visited the National Aquarium (a brief walk from the hotel). He let us leave our vehicle at the hotel while we got lunch and went to the Aquarium, and provided us with complimentary bottles of water.

The only downside is that valet is $30 per day, but to me it was well worth it and I knew my car was being kept somewhere safe for being in a major city. The lobby was very well decorated, and we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff. He asked us the reason for our stay and I mentioned that we were there for a night out with a group of friends in the area. He even gave us free passes to a local bar at the Power Plant Live area. Our room was very clean and it still smelled like the cleaner when we walked in! The beds were also very comfy. There was a nice sized flat screen TV and the bathroom was also very clean and a deent size. We were attending a concert at Rams Head Live that night, and it was a 5-10 minute walk there, and it was also very safe. We left Rams Head around 2:00AM and walked back with a friend, but it was also very safe to walk back at that time of night as there were plenty of people walking about and it was well lit. We didn't have any problems with noise and slept nicely. The next morning I called down to valet for my car and it was brought to me within 15 minutes. The valet worker even provided us with cold bottled water for our ride home and gave me a map with directions on how to get out of the city safely. We were very pleased with our stay.

We asked about other options and they basically said there weren't any! We found that hard to believe, but it was late and we were exhausted. The rooms are compact, but the beds are comfortable and it was clean. Interesting showers where the water falls on your head. Kudos to the cleaning staff who are clearly the most capable employees (with the exception that I note below)! The only stair case was restricted to hotel staff. Given the need to get exercise, I found this appalling. But they only have one elevator in each tower so you have to use it to even get to the second floor (which we were not on) - which makes it a local every time, when it finally comes! Saturday night we went down to the hotel restaurant and bar to try to get some food because the event we were out tended to run out. It was around 10:45. We had a seat and watched some people getting appetizers, but no one came to serve us. We finally went up to the bar and were told that the kitchen was closed and no food was available! This a Saturday night near the inner harbor. It is my understanding that they have to serve food if they are serving liquor so this is probably illegal also. Sunday morning we were checking out and had to be at the event we were running early. I placed a wake up call that never happened! So the morning was very hectic. I went downstairs to get a luggage rack and there weren't any. When I asked if there were any and explained that I was late because they had not delivered the wake up call, they had the audacity to suggest I wait more while they look for a cart, and didn't even apologize for not placing the wake up call. I went back upstairs on their local elevator, we hung all of our stuff for the training on our bodies, and we waited for the elevator. People had ridden it up to be sure to get on so with us it was pretty full. We went down a floor and a staff member insisted on squeezing on with a huge cart full of towels. People were standing on top of my feet and each other to fit him on and he made us even later just to move his huge cart one floor. We got downstairs and fortunately they had retrieved our car, but they had backed it in so we had to stand on their spikey plants to load our car. Not sure if it was good for their plants but it was certainly not good for our suits. There was a taxi blocking us in, so I leaned on the horn for about 5 minutes making a HUGE racket and no one came. We had to leave so we somehow managed to maneuver out with only minor damage to our new car. This place was a night mare. I will never go back.

As an eco-hotel, there's an emphasis on recycling, \"green\" products, etc, though I can't say that it was really evident during breakfast.The courtyard was very comfortable to use with an interesting water feature. There is no pool, and there's a tavern attached to the lobby, so it's a bit more \"grown up\" perhaps than some Fairfield Inns, but the location is perfect for families visiting the Inner Harbor, National Aquarium, Little Italy, etc... Valet parking was about $28/day but we parked on the street one block behind the hotel in an area where the residents had no garages and parked on the street. It seemed fairly safe and the car was fine. The desk staff was not super knowledgable but always tried to be helpful. I found it easier to use the internet to find direction, but the computers were conveniently only a few feet away from the front desk. There was also free wifi in the rooms. At check in, I was informed that due to fire code, no rollaway was possible with the 2Q room, despite having reserved this hotel on the Marriott website months earlier and indicating a desire for a rollaway. Since I have teens of different genders, we really have to have a 3rd bed. The clerk worked with me to find a solution, first offering me a different type of room at a much higher price and then, when I expressed my disappointment in the additional costs, looked to find a handicapped room with 2 Qs and asked if we would be okay with it. Turns out this room was huge and had plenty of room for a rollaway. We were very comfortable. There was some noise in the hall which we could hear in the room and at one point, someone was running around up a floor from us and it was fairly loud, but we didn't hear the folks next door. The breakfast was definitely a step below the Residence Inns we'd been staying at. There was cereal, yogurt, instant oatmeal, some refrigerated prepared fruit, small (but tasty) muffins, the ubiquitous make-your-own waffle maker, and pre=packaged, refrigerated breakfast items (one was allegedly a pig in a blanket on a stick, but looked like a corn dog and the other was an awful \"quiche\"). Also toast, juice, bananas, etc.. But the coffee was the best we had on our trip and made up for alot with us! Disposable everything--plates, cups, glasses, etc,. However, the room was clean and had lots of different seating options; again we found it very comfortable. The only facilities issue I had was that there was only one elevator and no staircase we could find to the lobby (it went outside). The hotel did feel really secure because of that but the waits at the elevator could get a little long. I would stay here again without hesitation.

The rooms are very nice and spacious and the staff is equally friendly and very accomodating. When we arrived we requested a mini fridge. Our room did not have one so they upgraded us to a 3 room suite. My granddaughter was thrilled to have an additional flat screen TV with living room area. It was simply lovely. They also had a complimentary wonderful continental breakfast in a lovely atrium setting. All the sites of the Inner Harbor such as the National Aquarium, Planetarium, Water Taxis to Fort McHenry and Fells Point, are nearby along with Little Italy restaurants right behind the hotel. The only drawback I can think of is we had to pay for parking and since we stayed the next day after we checked out we had to pay an additional fee.

Here are our pros and cons: PROS: (1) This is a beautiful property! Location was excellent and very accessible to Johns Hopkins and the Inner Harbor. We valet parked the car when we arrived and walked the rest of the time, which was good for many reasons. (2) We reserved the eco friendly/Allergy Suite and it was beautiful -- spacious, two levels with 2 TVs and a bike to use if you should chose to ride through downtown Baltimore! (3) We were tired and cold and did not want to walk with our group to find someplace to eat for dinner -- we ended up eating at the hotel and we loved it! What more can we say? Stella Artois (and many others!) on draft!! The sliders were good, chicken fingers were yummy and the service was great (yeah to the staff member from Pennsylvania who knew about food allergies!!). On another note, the Jewish Deli down the street -- Attman's -- is not to be missed for lunch! (3) We loved the open courtyard area -- it was really just beautiful and tranquil to sit with an early morning coffee (which we did) or an evening drink (which we did) and look up at the city sky and just relax! It was a truly unique feature in a hotel that encompasses the history and beauty of the building (a restored brewery -- so beautifully re-done!) that the courtyard alone is worth staying at this hotel! (4) Rooms and main areas are sparkling clean. (5) Small but tidy and welcoming Market area had items available for sale in case you are craving a sweet treat or forgot something! (6) We did not care about the parking fee -- it is a city, they brought our car up SOO fast the next morning (thank you)! (7) We will be back!! (8) We liked the interactive map in the lobby with a touch screen and big graphics -- very cool! CONS: (1) In our suite, there is no door separating the sleeping area from the living area; however, there are stairs. As a result, there are 2 TVs very close together, not buffered by a wall and both TVs turn off and on (or mute) when you use the remote for one of the TVs. This \"dual functionality\" did not seem to effect changing the TV channel, but it was a tad annoying. (2) In the exercise room, there are TVs attached to the treadmills and one big TV on the wall. The TVs on the treadmills did not (a) work, on one of the treadmills; and (b) on the one that did work, the channel would not change from CBS/local. On the other hand, the very large wall TV (which is beautiful and very sleek) but only has a limited number of TV channels -- which was annoying and perplexing! Where were the local TV channels on this sleek/state of the art TV? The channels appear to start at 17 and go up but do not go lower than 17. In my opinion, the workout/exercise room was excellent, but the detracting and somewhat annoying electronics \"issues\" with the TVs were preeminent in my mind! (3) No salt and pepper available for the morning breakfast -- easy fix that they could make. (4) I cannot understand -- and none of us ever did -- how to work the heaters in the room. We were very cold at night, so be sure to check on the specifics before it is too late at night to ask (or when you are too tired to bother!).

An hour turned into almost 3 hours having to wait for our rooms. We felt that the front desk staff person who assisted was not completely honest about the condition and timeliness of the room being ready. In addition, the other staff working at the desk were not friendly and did not present us with a warm and friendly greeting despite our effort to be the most curteous and nicest guests. The second thing that was a turnoff was the fact that there was no on-site parking but you had to pay $27 for validated parking.. bummer! I suppose that's not too bad for a Downtown Area.
