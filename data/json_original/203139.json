Husband is a lifetime Marriott Platinum. I had to reserve 2 rooms as virtually all Marriotts in Europe will not allow 3 in a room on points. I wrote the hotel asking for an early check in if possible. I also asked for 2 rooms close together or the one upgrade to a Jr. Suite which would have allowed my husband, daughter and I to stay together. I explained to the hotel it was our first trip since the death of our oldest daughter and we would like to be together. Not only did we not get an early check in (I guess I didn't really except an early check in although it was low season and the hotel was nowhere near full), our rooms were not ready at the normal 2:00 checkin time. We finally got in one room at 4:00. Our daughter's room next door was still not clean. We were told, even though we booked 2 rooms we would have to pay for our daughter's breakfast..a first. The room was teeny, no platinum upgrade on second floor and the view was the wall of a building and there was no bathtub, only a shower. I called reception 3 times about the room and kept being told it was all they had. Finally I requested to speak to the manager. I was very nice and explained the situation. We were upgraded to a suite, but were told they would keep both certificates (total of 320,000 points). Obviously there was a better room available and as a Platinum we should have been upgraded. The hotel is beautiful and the view from a decent room. outstanding. The breakfast staff is very good, but the breakfast is below average for a hotel of this statute. The front desk staff remained pretty rude. We stayed 4 nights and left the hotel at 9 am to catch a train to Naples.I got out my wallet before we left and got out the train tickets. When I got on the train and unzipped my purse my wallet was not there, I left it in the room. We got to Naples in an hour and went through the luggage and the wallet was not there. I called the hotel and they said the room had not been cleaned and they would go check and call back. After 30 minutes we called them and were curtly told the wallet was not there. When we got to our hotel in Sorrento we went through the luggage again, no wallet. We called the hotel again and begged them to check again and call us back. After an hour we called them. Of course by now the room is not only cleaned, but rented and we were curtly told no wallet. The wallet HAD to be left in the room. Yes, we stayed on points, but have never been made to feel guilty for this. We heard a couple having breakfast who arrived that morning and they were on points, given an upgrade to a suite and offered breakfast the day they checked in and had their room at 8 am, but they were British. We were very nice up to the point of no effort on the wallet. Also the beds are very hard and uncomfortable not up to Marriott standards or the standard of a high quality hotel.

Here is one downside of this (and most high end) Marriotts....at peak season they are full of loud, obnoxious, large American housewives with 2+ iPhone disinterested teenagers in tow and a beaten down corporate exec husband who paid for the entire trip with frequent flyer miles and then Marriott miles.

The pillows were terrible - they were actually lumpy (which I can say I have never experienced before!). Bathroom was fine. The buffet breakfast was a total ripoff for 30 euro (but it does have a great view). We got a 2-for-1 coupon, but I would not go back. Totally not worth it - go down the street to the Westin and go to their coffee bar. We got croissants and coffee there for about 6 euro total. The Marriott did not seem to have a cafe - just the main restaurant. Location of this hotel is good - we could walk to the Spanish Steps area. The staff at the Marriott were friendly. The concierge was helpful when we arrived, and the doorman was always pleasent. Housekeeping was fine - no complaints. So, overall, it was fine. But I would choose another hotel in Rome if I went back.

There was even a charming little hallway, with a device to hang your jacket on. The bathroom was beautifully tiled in a rich green color, but even though all amenities were available, I found it a little short on storage space - nowhere to place your toilet bag, except for either the end of the bath or on a funny little stool that was under the sink. I think if I was staying there for longer than one night, I might get annoyed at not being able to set my things on a shelf somewhere. Another nice touch is that the floor is covered in parquet, as opposed to carpet, so it felt kinda old-world - like being in someone's European apartment and not in a hotel. Breakfast was included in the price I paid and the location of the breakfast buffet was a treat in itself. The restaurant is located on the top floor, with tables inside and outside on a terrace with a view of all of Rome and the Borghese park next door. I could've spent all day up there gazing out. It was perfect. And the food was great as well - we enjoyed a couple of gorgeous tarts with our eggs and toast.

The staff, generally, are exceptional, especially the front desk, bar and restaurant. Be careful when you need a taxi as they don't gather around the hotel and sometimes the wait can be ten minutes, even by request from the concierge. The building has a long history and indeed, as an other reviewer has stated, has a definite old world charm. The bedrooms are quiet, and spacious to a degree and there is great attention to detail. One of the highlights of this hotel is the roof terrace breakfast room which is also used for functions and weddings. In good weather, you can eat outside and take in some wonderful views of the city, especially towards the Vatican and the Villa Borghese. The breakfast buffet is a quality one with a myriad of hot dishes, cold meats, cheeses, fruit and cereal. One word of warning - be careful about eating outside in September as the wasps can be a nuisance. The hotel is very well situated for the Villa Borghese, Spanish Steps, Roma Terminii, and the airport is, in good traffic conditions, just half an hour away. The fixed charge of around \u20ac45 makes a taxi good value for 2-3 passengers. By train to Roma Terminii from the airportis OK, but the very long walk from the dedicated platforms to taxis and the subway is a trek - just think of the distances at Heathrow T3 on arrival.

We used Marriott points for the room, and received free breakfasts due to my wife's status - good thing because I'm sure the hotel is expensive and as many people have written. the breakfast is very expensive although the view from the restaurant on top of the hotel is great - although they had a bee problem on the outside deck (not too much they can do about this).

The breakfast has moved to downstairs cafe for now, with many choices for the hot or cold selections. As one poster mentioned, the eggs are not as \"thick\" as in the US, but this was consistent with my experiences at many other European hotels - this one also offered an omelet type selection on the buffet as well. There was a wide selection of juices, coffees, teas, prosecco, & water. The buffet has two sections & there were a lot of choices, so you shouldn't go away hungry. It is a short walk to Barberini station. The entrance to Spagna station looks like it is across the street, BUT it is actually a longer walk to the station itself than Barberini. There is a small grocery station inside this metro though & it has good prices. I used this station to walk to/from the Spanish Steps a few times, especially when it was really hot out. Termini station is a short cab ride away if you are in a hurry or don't want to take the metro (6-8 euro). If you are interested in the Hop-On, Hop-Off buses, there is a stop nearby. I saw them coming by at regular intervals. The concierge can also set up private tours of Rome & the rates were reasonable and even better than comparable services. There is also a Mail Box Etc across the street. Several embassies are nearby, including the American Embassy down the street. If you are walking down Via Ludovisi, look at the beautiful Swiss Institute on the left, it has a nice grotto in the front. They offer tours, but are closed until September.

I booked a single that I knew would be small, but since I was extending my business trip for a few days to enjoy the leisure of room on my own, I did not mind a small room. However, it was not only small, but directly overlooked the large trash bin in the courtyard. I went to the front desk and explained that altough the size was not an issue, I did not want my first memories of Rome to be of a large trash bin. They were booked but asked me to leave my luggage at my room door the next morning, and they would put me somewhere else when I returned from sightseeing the next day. Wow!!! Was I surprised when they upgraded me to a very spacious room that was 3x my original room size. Moreover, it was on a high floor and overlooked the Via Veneto rather than the courtyard. In addition, it was one of only a couple rooms that had a full balcony. The three nights in that room were spent in great comfort. Such an upgrade, at no incremental cost to me, exemplified the effort the hotel staff extends to make their guests stay memorable. * Room was very comfortable, and even luxurious. * Common areas are well kept and exude a premium setting. * Location. Easy walking distance to the Trivi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. Plus if you love to shop (I do not), you will revel in the shopping aloing the Via Veneto. Drawbacks. * None. My entire experience was among the best I have ever had at a 5 star property. Thoughts on Rome: Definitely see the tourist sites, but also make time to relax over lunch and dinner. Weather permitting, sit outside and watch the world go by. Soak up the rich Roman experience and enjoy these experiences with a good glass of red wine (which need not be expensive). Walk leisurely from the Trivi Fountain to the Pantheon and enjoy the history of that walk. Then enjoy a nice meal in the Piazza that abuts the Pantheon and watch the moon rise above.

We had two rooms - one for my wife and I, one for our two sons (18, 20). We walked nearly the entire city from this excellent location over the course of our stay. We were greeted in the manner one would expect at a Marriott Level 8 property - with graciousness and efficiency - by Anna Rosa at Reception. Even though we were staying on points, we were treated in grand style. Anna Rosa profusely apologized for not having a room upgrade for us (our trip coincided with the Italian National Holiday - the place was buzzing with VIP's). We found our rooms to be delightful nonetheless, and the interior courtyard views actually helped ward off the noise from the street. The linens were top notch, the bath amenities splendid, the bed was quite comfortable and no smoke smell in the room which is a delight in Europe. We took advantage of the Breakfast Buffet every day. The views from the rooftop terrace are simply stunning. Although the items did not change that much, there were so many things to choose from it never really was an issue. The service was either great or lacking depending upon the day. We were spoiled by the hostess every day, and by Rita and Delannia on their days working. The other waitstaff seemed preoccupied with the hovering manager (really tall young guy). These distractions were exacerbated when the older well-tanned gentleman (general manager?) hovered as well. He just seemed to make the younger manager and the staff even more uptight. After watching a few days, I'd suggest they let the capable staff do their job and not direct them so overbearingly. Maybe they could even lend a hand (or schedule another person! But nonetheless, we were quite satisfied with breakfast. Grumpy managers won't spoil our memories of this wonderful hotel. We walked as far as the Pantheon one day, the Colosseum another, saving taxis for a trip to the Vatican and to the train station. We enjoyed the large park just the other side of the old city walls. The food was much more reasonable the farther we got from the hotel, so we enjoyed dinner and stroll each evening. We also took the fast train to Florence on our last day - which was a great break in the action. On our departure, Silvia at Reception sent us away with graciousness and warm wishes, and Anna Rosa stopped over to apologize again for not having a room upgrade.

Marco and front desk were outstanding to us. The hotel was very full when we arrived, and even though our room on the first night was fine, they were very gracious and moved us to a larger room with a larger bathroom, and with beautiful views for our last 4 nights, and generously included the rooftop breakfast for our stay, even though our Marriott status didn't warrant it. It truly completed the end of our trip with a bang and flourish! After reading some reviews and realizing location of hotel in a posh area, I was a bit concerned about possibly being snubbed at this hotel, not arriving in the most chic of style after a full day of sightseeing and driving upon entrance. My worries were put to rest --- Everyone at the front desk for the entire stay made every endeavor to be the most helpful they could be --- they went above and beyond. The only downside (for them!) is they almost seemed overworked.... I noticed many of them worked extremely long hours, and seemed to be there when we left in the morning, and when we returned in the evening. Big credit to them for maintaining their professionalism and helpfulness even with the long hours. Each encounter with the concierge desk was very helpful also, and they were very nice and efficient. We never did ask for restaurant guidance (got that from other sources), but they were great booking reservations for us (which by the way, it seemed at both restaurants we used that for, the Flora carried weight) and giving directions. More kudos I would like to give, is to the rooftop restaurant at breakfast each morning. They were extremely hardworking, pleasant, gracious and obviously tried very hard to please everyone. If there wasn't something, they would get it for you. It was SUCH a pleasure starting each day there with a leisurely breakfast and gorgeous views and great service. As far as the room, the king-size bed was great, extremely comfortable (I'm picky), and my son's single bed they had brought in was better made up than any hotel I've been in for a rollaway/extra bed! The shower was wonderful, with a rain head and an extremely powerful handheld, and heated towel bars. The amenities were also great... good shampoos and soaps, lotion and mouthwash. Always more than enough towels, and they were great towels. The bathroom was spotlessly clean. Here are a few tiny downsides, not enough counting off for, as nothing is perfect, but worth a mention. Our room either wasn't vacuumed every day or not vacuumed well... I had dropped a few tiny paper shreds beside the bed when tearing something the 2nd night, and noticed they were never vacuumed up entire rest of stay. Nothing to complain about as rest of room and bathroom absolutely spotless. Rooms on the Borghese garden views can be a bit noisy... sirens, trucks dumping what sounded like recyables (glass shattering sounds) every morning early, etc. But hey, you are in the middle of a city, what do you expect! Just mentioning, in case you feel the need to ask for a different location for perhaps more quiet! It didn't bother us. One other thing: when we arrived, we were keeping our car for one extra day for an Almafi coast daytrip, and the doorman was quite forceful trying to get us to go to the 50euro/night garage at the hotel -- wasn't pleasant. We went very nearby to the Borghese Garden garage for 18euro a night which before we went on the trip the concierge at hotel had emailed me about upon my inquiry. Speaking of emails, Marco was extremely responsive and timely in answering all of emails I sent to the hotel before our trip... as was the concierge desk when he referred us to them for questions. I thought I saw when I checked in, copies of my emails with our reservation. If so, that's a very good customer service move :). All in all, if there was a feeling of being snubbed at this hotel, it was with the doormen --- for instance, of all the times we took cabs during our stay, to and from hotel, I think only once was the door opened for me. We were there on a budget and might have looked it, but to everyone else's credit at the hotel, they were wonderful!

We spent our first three nights in Rome and stayed at the Marriott Grand Flora. It is on Via Veneto in the northern part of the city in a very upscale neighborhood about two blocks from the American embassy and then another couple of blocks from the Hard Rock Cafe. The only reason I mention the proximity to those two places is to point out that this neighborhood seems to cater to well-to-do American travelers. The area was clean, quiet and safe - very upscale. The hotel is just a hop over from the Westin by the embassy where all of the diplomats seemed to be staying. The staff at the hotel spoke good English, although I sensed a bit of an attitude in spite of my efforts to speak Italian. The rooms were clean and spacious by European standards. The porters were attentive and the concierge generally helpful. There were two computers near the lobby with complimentary Internet access and a couple of restaurants. There is a roof terrace where they serve a breakfast buffet. The views across to the Vatican are quite nice, but the breakfast was certainly not worth 30 Euros per person! If I could do it over, I'd skip the breakfast and just go up and ask to spend a few minutes out on the terrace to take in the view and snap some photos. With no offense intended toward the hotel, there are two significant drawbacks to it. First is value. The only reason we chose this hotel was because we could stay on Marriott points and we were trying to keep the cost of our trip down. However, her parents paid the full rate, which was over 300 Euros per night. We stayed at other hotels in Italy that were perfectly clean and spacious and included free breakfast that cost a third of that rate. So I'm not giving them high marks on value. I feel like we could have stayed somewhere else and been just as happy and saved a lot of money. If you're using points, that's one thing. But if you're paying, I'd consider the cost factor. The other main drawback was location. The hotel is not too far from Piazza Barberini, where you can catch the metro. The problem is that the metro in Rome is not nearly as helpful to tourists as it is in other world cities. There are buses, but that may not be your thing. It wasn't for us. You can reach the Spanish Steps within 20 minutes or so by walking, but it is extremely far to walk to the Ancient City Center and darn near ridiculous to try walking to the Vatican. We did a lot more walking than was probably necessary and took a few too many taxis, in my opinion. It would have been easier to stay closer to the city center by saving our wallets and our feet from exhaustion. Don't get me wrong - we are Marriott loyalists and rack up many, many points per year. But the American luxury chains in Europe are so expensive just because they're in Europe. I think they do well because some travelers feel more comfortable with a brand they know and cost isn't a factor. If you're seeing more than Rome, you'll almost be forced to stay at local hotels, and once you do, comparatively speaking, you may feel that you overpaid at the Grand Flora. We definitely had a great stay with them.

I said this won't do and went back downstairs to the clerk. There was a flurry of Italian and no posibles, (I speak some Italian and Spanish) but I said this is not what we paid for through the cruise line. I even called the Princess rep over to look into it. They said perhaps something would come up later and suggested that we go for lunch. We did and miraculously, upon returning were shown to a lovely room facing the Via Veneto. A European friend had once counseled me that most Europeans will not accept the first room offered, and ask to see several. My husband usually stays in the lobby because he knows better. He usually accepts whatever is given him. I was not looking for an upgrade just what we had paid for with Princess. The rest of the stay was wonderful, the bed was very comfy and had nice linens, housekeeping was timely and there was turn down service nightly. The location cannot be beaten and the room was quiet enough, although I don't mind city noises. Breakfast was very nice from their rooftop cafe. The selections were good. You could see all of Rome from the terrace. It would be fabulous for a wedding reception. The service there was also excellent. We had tickets to the Galleria Borghese, and the park was televising the World Cup matches in the park. There were lots of people having fun all over.

I would rate the hotel higher if we had not had the unfortunate incident with the tiny dark room that they tried to push on us. We did something different this time and had a private cooking class with an American woman who lives in the shadows of the Coliseum. Her website looks great but I do not recommend her class at all. It was overpriced for what she cooked. We first shopped at the Markets of Testaccio and then headed back to her flat but she was bad tempered and rude, and the food was ordinary. We shared the class with another couple and the instructor made out like a bandit for what she spent on materials that day and what she collected from us. She refused to cook a meat or fish dish. The view of the coliseum from her roof was spectacular though. I will be more careful from now on as to whom I book independent classes with.

It was annoying to have them handle two or three phone calls while simultaneously trying to provide you with some type of customer service. A lot of the reviewers talked about the breakfast buffet. Perhaps we should have tried it, but at around fifty dollars per person that seemed over the top even by Rome and Via Veneto standards. Room service was very fast, but pretty much a crap-shoot as to what you would receive and what you would be charged. The first day we ordered coffee and croissants in the morning and received a nice pot of coffee and a small basket of croissants and assorted pastries and jams. According to the menu this should have cost a total of 19 Euros--they billed us 60 Euros (which the front desk changed to 13 Euros after I inquired about proper price). We ordered exactly the same thing the next day and received coffee and two very small croissants with no butter or jam. The third day I inquired as to what I would receive if we ordered the same thing, but the person who was taking the order did not speak enough English for effective communication so we just had coffee. Internet connection and the Business Center were free, which was nice. However, connectivity was inconsistent.

We normally don't eat in hotel restaurants but decided to give the Cabiria a try our first night since it was raining - it was the best Marriott restaurant we have experienced. Rita was most helpful as was the chef in providing items for my wife who has dietary issues. We ate there twice even though there were several good restaurants close by. The hotel recommended a local restaurant around the corner to the right which was excellent and we found found 2 more across the street and down a couple of blocks on Aurora. There is a great coffee and pastery shop across the street and to the left. Also across the street next to Harry's Bar is a walking tunnel to the Spanish Steps (15 min) there is an elevator to the top of the Steps just before step out of the tunnel. Also a great grocery store in the tunnel 7 min with great wine and cheese.

The Room: Clean, comfortable and spacious with a HUGE bathroom. Loved it. Not the greatest view in the world but I was hardly in the room--there is so much to do and see (and eat!) in Roma. The breakfast buffet was perfect but what was even more perfect is the view you get of the city while sipping your coffee. Amazing. (I attached some pics) For the buffet, they had your typical European assortment of food; eggs (hardboiled or scrambled) a selection of cheese and meats, tons of breads/pastries, an assortment of juices etc, etc. It was not lacking anything. Also, Donatella at the front desk was always courteous and accomodating---so were the other dining room staff. If you're going to be in Rome for a few days, it's worth it to purchase the Roma Pass (25 euros) which allows you free access to ALL transit plus gets you in free to 2 museums/monuments.

When researching a hotel to stay at in Rome using points I must have missed the \"booking w/ points window\" for the Marriott Grand Flora dispite being over nine months early. Despite this, Marriott worked with me, contacted the hotel and the hotel gave us approval to use points. Additionally the automatically upgraded us with an executive suite with a great view of Via Veneto. Being a Marriott Gold Member also entitled us to breakfast as part of our room package. The Hotel: We had excellent service and there were no problems checking in. We arrived way before check in time but within an hour they had our room ready to go giving us some time to grab breakfast at a nearby cafe. The lobby was clean and cozy and did come with free wireless internet. There was also a bar and restaurant off of the lobby area. We had some drinks at the bar but did not utilize the restaurant. The concierge was excellent and made some excellent dining recommendations during our stay along with some good sightseeing tips. They also offered various tours that we did not utilize. Quick note, the hotel does not sell the Roma Pass however there is a Tabac around the corner that sells them. The Room: We utilized points for our stay as mentioned and were upgraded to an executive suite. We stayed on the fifth floor in the corner room. One side of our room had a very nice view facing south down the Via Veneto and the other window had a nice view of the western Rome skyline and the Villa Borghese. The room consisted of a small breezeway just inside the main door with a large dresser, closet and bathroom access just inside the door. Then you entered the main room area that featured a king size bed, small tv, a desk and small chair and table area. I've noticed a lot of complaints that the rooms were small at this hotel - I guess if you're thinking it's going to be an \"American style\" suite you will be dissappointed but for two people this was more than enough space and was very comfortable and romantic. I prefer a bed with stronger support which this bed had in my opinion. The bathroom had plenty of room to do what you needed and was very clean and nice. Being on the corner room I'm guessing the actual tub/shower stall had to be fit into a somewhat tight space but overall it was fine. Lastly, I have read some complaints that the street noise kept people up at night. We had no issue with this but we are hard sleepers. We noticed some honking here and there but nothing major. We honestly didn't notice a whole lot when we closed the curtains all the way. Make sure to do the turndown service if for nothing else then the snacks they leave on your bed...they are delicous! Our only compaint is about the air conditioning. It was really hot and humid when we were there and you have to leave a key in a wall sensor to keep the AC going. The first day we left the key in w/ the air on...when we came back to the room looking forward to a relaxing (and chilling) break from the heat...the housekeeping service had taken the extra key thereby turning off he AC. However, once turned back on the room cooled off quickly. The Location: I read a great tip about arriving from the airport and taking the metro and will repeat it here. There are two metro stops within a 5-10 minute walk from the Grand Flora...the Barberini stop and the Spagna stop. Use the Spagna stop if you are arriving from the airport with bags. You can walk underground on a smooth service by following the directions from the Spagna stop to the Via Veneto. You will literally be let out of the underground passage way directly in front of the hotel. Yes, you lose the views of the city while you are underground but you can make that up later. If you get off at Barberini you will have a long, winding walk up hill with all your luggage. A taxi from the central station to the hotel will run you about 8-10 Euro in traffic. Being on the fabulous Via Veneto you are surrounded by a ton of excellent restaurants, cafes and even a few night clubs. Yes, Harry's Bar is across the street - go in - have a drink and a snack - live the good life and be on your way. Keep in mind the area around this hotel is very, very expensive. The traditional Italian dinner for two (app, 1st course, 2nd course, bottle of \"reserve\" wine and dessert) will run you around 150 Euro. Just a short walk down the Via Veneto you can find excellent restaurants for half the price and just as good. There are a number of bus lines that stop just out front of the hotel so you have easy access to all the sights. Additoinally, one of the \"hop on - hop off\" bus stops just a few blocks south of the hotel and it appeared that all the rest of the hop on - hop off busses stopped at the Piazza Barberini south of the hotel within a 5-10 minute walk. We could not find a nearby market to buy light snacks, drinks, wine for the room so you will either have to use the minibar or stop outside the Via Veneto area to get a few things. The only reason I bring this up is that the Villa Borghese (huge park) is literally right across the street and is an excellent spot for picknicking and people watching. The Rooftop Terrace: Simply beautiful. The rooftop terrace is the area where breakfast is served every morning and it has an amazing view of Rome and particularly of the dome at St. Peters Basillica. If you are a Marriott Rewards member and get free breakfast take advantage of this opportunity. If not, breakfast is really expensive, I would recommend having one breakfast just for the view. I've noticed a lot of people complaining about the breakfast and that it was not substancial enough...those people are crazy. If you are expecting the traditional american breakfast and do not like to try new things you will be dissappointed. Or you can enjoy some excellent coffee, amazing pastries and fresh bread, juices, teas, mamosas, Coke (in glass bottles), various types of sausages, bacon (it won't be real crisp), fresh italian meats and cheeses and assorted types of eggs (scrambled was kind of soggy but the \"omellette\" tasted more like regular scrambled eggs). I am not picky so I gave everything a try over the course of our stay and really enjoyed it. My wife is more picky but \"managed\" to get buy on the fresh pastries, croissants and nutella. There was one interesting selection on the buffett and it was labeled \"potatoes\" and \"second course\" - I won't ruin the suprise but it's pretty funny - if you go - make sure to open this heating dish up and peek inside. The Sights: There are a number of great sights within easy walking distance to the hotel and the rest of Rome is accessible via the metro or bus. Spend some time getting to know the public transport system - it only takes a few minutes - and you will pat yourself on the back for it. We are walkers...we walked a ton and utilized the metro and the hop on/off bus tour quite a bit. Within easy walking distance are the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain (both maybe a 10 minute walk). As mentioned, the Villa Borghese (think of it as Rome's Central Park) is literally across the street and features a fantastic art museum (you have to reserve a timeslot at the Museo Borghese and space is limited - book it before you arrive or at least two days prior to when you want to see it). You can walk to the central train station or take the metro a couple of stops. To walk to the central train station give yourself 15-20 minutes. 10 more minutes past (south) of the train station and you'll be starring the Colesseum in the face along with the Roman Forum, Palatine Hill and the ancient center of Rome. The Vatican is difficult to get to anywhere in Rome - you can take the Metro a few stops and walk a bit - we found it easier to just take a taxi b/c we were on a tight timeline - it cost us 14 Euro. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our time in Rome and the Marriott Grand Flora was a big part of our enjoyment. As mentioned, we stayed using Marriott points. Rooms at this hotel can run into the $300's per night...If you are a $300 a night person you may at least want to take a look at a couple of the nearby hotels just to compare. There were a lot of top end hotels in the area. I'm not the type of traveller that would normally pay this much money for any hotel. If I was travelling for business I would be a little put off that I had to pay for wi-fi in the room but at the same time...I would be in Rome...I would probably go down to the lobby bar or just outside on the cafe and do some work versus sitting in my room.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Potomac, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel on Exquisite Via Venuto\u201d", "Author": "Stephen11000", "ReviewID": "UR81016831", "Content": "The Marriott Gran Flora is a wonderful hotel.

Take the A line to Spagna station and follow signs to Villa Borghese, which will lead you to \"Via Vittorio Veneto\" tunnel and will dump you directly across the street from the hotel. This is all underground in tunnels--safe and lined with window shopping displays. I recommend this with your luggage as the streets of Rome are crowded and cobblestone, so this direct, underground route is the best when you are tired and dragging your luggage around. For the rest of your trip, walk above ground and enjoy the neighborhood!! Barberini metro is a little closer and I preferred that to the crowd of the Spanish Steps. Either will work fine! (Just use Spagna with your luggage.) The front desk staff of the hotel varied from being very helpful and welcoming, to downright rude. The doormen were all good and our young lady for housekeeping was a sweetheart!! Everyone spoke English (or enough anyway) so communication was not a problem for those of us who do not speak Italian.

The best thing we found about this hotel was the location; it is easily accessible to the Borghese Gardens, the Metro (Spagna stop), and not a far walk from the center of Rome. The lobby was pretty, with a lot of marble details and a lovely skylight. We checked in around 7 pm and were given room #108. After being in the room for about 30 seconds, the noise level from the Via Veneto below was pretty deafening, even though the windows were closed (we felt like we were on the street!!). When we investigated this further, we found that the extremely old windows did not have any type of seal around the edges so the noise was not filtered or blocked from being heard. The room was pretty small with an abnormally huge closet that was impractical and odd. The bathroom was fairly newly renovated and was fine. We called the front desk to inquire about changing rooms to one on a higher floor and were told that they were completely booked for that night and to call back the next day to see if there was anything they could do about the remainder of our trip. This answer frustrated us because we did not know if we were going to be stuck in this loud, weird room for the entirety of our trip, effectively ruining our night.

After showing the front desk multiple confirmation forms I had printed detailing the package, I finally gave in and paid the extra 40euro (against my best judgment). The room we were given was nice and spacious and the bathroom was very clean and very big. The Christmas Eve dinner was good and they even allowed us to substitute one course of the meal for something different, as I am not personally fond of an all-seafood menu.

Getting there: The least expensive way to reach the hotel from Fiumicino Airport, is to catch the Leonardo Express at the airport. The tickets can be purchased for 11 Euros each at the self service machines in the train station (the machines accept US Credit Cards and have the option for English instructions). Then wait on the platform for the next train to come in. If you rush the doors when the train comes in, there is a decent chance you will get a seat for the 30 minute trip. Exit the train at the Termini Station and follow the \"M\" signs to the Metro Station. You will need to do a good bit of walking in the Termini Station, as the Leonardo Express platform is a long way from the Metro platforms (there are many moving sidewalks that will make the trip a little easier). Buy tickets for the Metro (a one day unlimited transport pass is only 4 Euro) and get on Line A- headed for Battistini. If you do not have Euro coins or small Euro notes (5 or 10 Euro notes) go to a ticket window and have the staff issue a ticket. Get off at the Spagna Station (the Barberini station is closer to the hotel, but if you are carrying luggage be advised you will need to carry the bags up a large hill and will need to do most of your walking outdoors). At the Spagna Station, use the exits towards Villa Borghese. After you follow the signs toward Villa Borghese, eventually you will see one that says Via Veneto. Follow those signs to the Via Veneto exit. Be advised that at a leisurely walk it will take you 15 minutes to get from the Metro platform to the hotel entrance. Also, as you head towards the hotel you will use a number of moving sidewalks, escalators, and walk through a number of tunnels. Do not be alarmed, as they are well lit and have security cameras (and maybe a few buskers). Eventually you will exit these tunnels by taking an escalator up to Via Veneto. This exit is right in front of Harry's Bar, and accross the street from the Grand Flora. Check In: Check in is normally 3 PM. We arrived at the hotel about 10:45 AM on a Saturday after a Trans-Atlantic flight. The check in staff was very gracious, and already had a key ready for us to check in. This was much appreciated as we wanted to take a shower and have a nap. Room: We used Marriott Rewards points to pay for the room, but despite that we were assigned a great room- #607 (the lobby is on the ground floor- floor 0 in Europe and floor 1 in the United States). Our first query when we got to the room was how to operate the lights. You have to insert your room key into a slot just inside the room door to activate the lights. Once we figured out how to turn on the lights, we were pleasantly surprised by the room. To the right of the entrance was a decent size bathroom with a deep single tub, toilet, and bidet. The bath had a hand shower, wall mounted shower, and plenty of hot water. The deep bath was very relaxing after a long day. The bathroom also had good amenities- shampoo, soap, body wash, conditioner, mouth wash, cotton swabs, cotton balls, nail files, hair dryer, and shower caps. Opposite the bathroom was a large walk in closet, with plenty of room for hanging items. Also there were drawers for non-hanging iterms and shelves for suitcases. There was an electronic safe. The bedroom portion had a firm king size bed, a writing desk (with paper) on one side of the bed, and a night table on the other side of the bed. There were switches on the side of the bed to operate all the lights and the roller shutter. There was a television that had about 20 channels, about 6 or 7 in Italian, and a few in French and German. There were two English language stations- BBC World News and Bloomberg News. There was also an honor bar in the room and a few snack items that were quite expensive. The mini bar did have some room so that you could put a few bottles of soda or water in it to keep them cool. Possibly the best feature of the room was the balcony. The balcony overlooked Via Veneto, and you could see St. Peter's dome. To the immediate right you could see the entrance to the park surrounding the Villa Borghese. The door to the Balcony was very well sealed, so you heard very little outside noise. Plus the balcony door/window had a roller shutter that blocked out all the light. This helped us get right to sleep for our afternoon nap. Service: The service at the hotel was superb. The desk staff spoke English very well. They also spoke some French. The concierge was very helpful and made dinner reservations for us one night, and arranged for a limo to take us to the airport for an early morning departure. There was a daily maid service (usually in the late morning), and a turn down service about 7 PM (the chocolates they left were artisan made and a welcome treat). Location: The hotel is located near a number of other hotels that cater to foreign tourists (the US Embassy and Hard Rock Cafe are only a half mile down Via Veneto from the hotel). While a short walk is required to get to the Metro station, most of it is through tunnels, so the weather is not really an issue. Also, in the tunnel to the Spagna Metro Station, there is a supermarket that has anything you would need such as sodas, wine, chocolate, grooming products, etc. (just look for the sliding glass doors with shopping trolleys outside). In addition the opposite exit of the Spagna Station is the Spanish Steps. So to get to the Spanish Steps you hardly have to go outside (just through the tunnels). For those so inclined, the first McDonald's in Italy is near the Spanish Steps. Food: On the top floor of the hotel is a lounge that serves breakfast. We ate there each morning. We were not charged for the breakfast because of our Marriott Rewards status. They served scambled eggs, waffles, cereals, breads, jam, fruit, bacon, sausage, cheeses, smoked salmon, olives, and many other choices- all in a buffet setting. They had coffee, juices, Fanta, Coke, Coke Light, and Champagne available at no extra charge to drink. We never ate at the hotel restaurant for lunch or dinner, but the prices seemed in line with other places nearby. The concierge will make reservations for you if you ask at places nearby (he made reservations for us at a place around the corner that was a good value). One day we did go to the aforementioned supermarket and got some fresh bread and meats for a picnic lunch on the Spanish Steps. Business: The lobby had free wifi and there were two public computers in the business center. All you need to do to use them is ask the from desk for a 30 minute password. The service is fast and was running each time we used it. If you needed more than 30 minutes they were happy to give you a password for a longer period. Also each room has wired internet and they would loan you a cord so that you could use your laptop in your room. Unfortunately my computer was acting up so I did not use the in room internet, but had no problem with the wifi in the lobby. Each room has a direct dial phone. I made one local call for about 5 minutes and it cost me 5 cents (Euro). Recreation: The hotel has a fitness room and and indoor pool, but we did not use them.

Marriott reservations accidentally made the reservation for room #2 for only 1 person (even though it was a room with 2 beds). Well, an extra person costs extra money - so upon arriving in Rome, I was informed that if I wanted to put 2 people in that room, it'd cost me extra. I politely requested that Marriott honor the price they quoted me, since the error was clearly theirs (why would I specifically reserve a room with 2 beds for only 1 person!?). I asked to speak with a manager and the desk agent (Marco Calderone) said that HE was a manager at ANOTHER Marriott, so I could speak with him. Well, Mr. Calderone -- AS A MANAGER, you should be in a position to make the situation right. If you can't, you should ALLOW me to speak with a someone who can! As all this was going on, another desk agent (older guy) leaned over to Mr. Calderone and spoke Italian to him. Unfortunately for him, I speak Italian and understood him when he said, \"wow, this guy wants you to fall for his lies, eh?\" I finished the rest of the argument in Italian and made sure the 2nd guy heard me and knew I understood him. Bottom line - Marriott Corporate made the situation right, after the fact, but the Grand Flora is dead to me so long as Marco Calderone and his old buddy are employed there.

We adored all three hotels, which are owned by the same company; this is the third hotel review from that trip.) We chose the classic Grand Flora because it faces the lovely Via Veneto in a very pedestrian-friendly area near the attractions we were visiting. It was my husband\u2019s first trip to Rome, and he deserved a first class experience. The Flora building has a long history and is not your typical modern Marriott; its Roman character shines. What we did while in Rome: Our goal was to visit the Borghese Gallery, Vatican and Colosseum and whatever smaller museums and sights fit our schedule. We went alone to the Borghese and then used prestotours.com for the Vatican and Colosseum/Forum tours. Having already been in Italy for 10 days, we wanted the last 6 days to be a relaxing time with lots of hours to walk the streets and parks and watch people from everywhere. Pros: Many luxury hotels are new and too modern for comfort. They also lack a distinct personality. But not the Flora. No one has built a hotel like this one in at least a hundred years. Entering the lobby and public spaces, you know you are in Italy. As noted before, the staff were superb. Combine that with a well kept, very old property by modern hotel standards, and you have a winner. Our room was on the 5th floor with a fantastic view of the ancient wall and Borghese Park. There was a wall safe for the laptop, free internet service, and a firm king bed was....... firm. While the bath was small, it had exquisite marble on the floor and walls. Again, the building is over a 100 years old, and had several uses before it was converted into a hotel. Breakfasts (included with our room) were served inside or outdoors on the 7th floor rooftop with an incredible view of the city. We ate outdoors 3 days and in the other 3 days when it was too windy. The buffet was incredible with food to satisfy all European and American tastes. They even had bottles of Coke and Diet Coke for soda addicts. We ordered our eggs to get soft scrambled or omelets. Service was superb during breakfast, the only meal we ate at the hotel. The hotel restaurant menus looked attractive but were too expensive for our budget, so we ate off property later in the day. If you walk a few blocks in either direction away from Via Veneto, you will find excellent, but less pricey, meals. The bellmen always obtained cabs within 5 minutes, and these were the best taxi drivers and cleanest cabs we had in Italy. Most cab rides were less than 10E, and they saved our legs for the long hikes at each attraction. Our flight home left Rome at 7AM, so we asked for a 4AM wake up call and a 4.30AM taxi. The front desk arranged it, and it went like clockwork. There was no traffic that early, and our driver was fantastic. With the long lines at check in and security, you may want to arrive by 5AM for a 7AM flight. We had only 30 minutes to spare after arriving at our departure gate. Cons: As a renovated historic building, this hotel is not easily accessible for the disabled. I remember two stairs at the front door. There are at least five stairs between the check-in area and the elevators. Thus, you must be able to climb some stairs to reach the elevators. Also, our bathroom was too small for a wheelchair or walker, and the tub looked impossible to crawl out of. We ended up showering because we did not want to risk falling as there was no handrail to hold onto while climbing out of a very deep tub. They did have a string hanging down in the bath, but it was not clear if this was for calling the desk if you fell in the tub. If your door was locked from the inside, I am not sure how the staff could enter your room to help if you did fall in the tub. We saw few people in wheelchairs in Rome because it is a very old city with few provisions for their access. Most of the buildings have elevators that were added hundreds of years later in cramped spaces with doors too narrow for wheelchairs and steps required to reach them. Often you have to squeeze tightly to get into these elevators. Also the tall cobblestones in many streets make it difficult to push a stroller much less a wheelchair. While we do not use a wheelchair, we would not recommend taking the route that most visitors use due to lack of access. We did not find a health club at this facility; you may feel (as we did) that after walking the Seven Hills of Rome all day, you will not need a health club. A relaxing shower and luxurious bed were all we craved. Bring sturdy shoes or hiking boots for your walking tours as the paths are treacherous in places due to missing and loose cobblestones, especially around the Forum area. A good map is handy there as well. We relied on Rick Steve's Rome guidebook for mountains of helpful info from the planning stage through the end of the trip. As mentioned above, restaurants on Via Veneto were too pricey for us. We turned left going out the front door of the hotel, and turned left again at the corner. Three blocks down was the San Marcos, a lively, huge restaurant where we found an early dinner for less than 50E a couple. They offer take out if you want to eat in your room. There were several other restaurants( within 4 blocks of the Grand Flora) that offered excellent food at 25E a person. With a large breakfast, you should be able to make it on one other large meal a day, especially if you sample their excellent gelato midday. Conclusions: The historic Grand Flora perfectly met our needs, and was a valuable reward for the 100 nights a year my husband spends in Marriotts. We would pay for this hotel if we did not have sufficient points because we felt safe and it was first class. The location was perfect for seeing Rome.", "Date": "January 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLoved It\u201d", "Author": "stewart1108", "ReviewID": "UR22807098", "Content": "My wife and I stayed the Marriott Grand Flora for our Honeymoon.

The Grand Flora is a beautiful, clean hotel with very nice views from the rooftop restaurant and they provided excellent service. We felt very safe in the hotel and surrounding neighborhood. The metro is a 10 minute walk to the Piazza Barberini, or 15 minute walk underground (safe/well-traveled) to the Piazza Spagna. It is also a short, but challenging walk to the Piazza della Popolo through the Borghese Gardens. We had a standard room with a queen size bed. It was very small. We asked to have the luggage rack at the end of our bed removed and that improved the situation, but the space still felt a little claustrophobic . We faced onto an inner courtyard and found the A/C in excellent working order and the room was quiet and sunny. We did not ask to change rooms because we arrived at the hotel after a 10 hour flight at 7am and were permitted to check in immediately, despite the early hour. We were very grateful and neither of us spent a lot of time in the room anyway. The bathroom was also very small, with no storage space for toiletries, but it was beautifully appointed. Everything was marble and the amenities included a bidet and hair dryer . The hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was excellent. The breakfast buffet, which was included with our room price (60euro for two if it is not--yikes!), was excellent and left little to the imagination. There was a nice selection of cheeses, pastries, meats, etc. The eggs were a little dry, but they are hard to do well buffet-style. We had the option of dining indoors or out, which was nice as Rome was in the midst of a heat wave during our stay and we did choose the A/C of the dining room a few of the days. Breakfast was served from 6:30am-10:30am and they even permitted us to partake immediately upon our super-early check in. We very much appreciated that consideration. The bartender is an artist with a dry martini. The small sidewalk cafe is an excellent place to enjoy a beverage and snack, and is a great place to people-watch on the Via Veneto. The staff here, as at breakfast, is attentive and friendly. We did not dine in the hotel as there are too many wonderful trattorias to explore in the city. We did not order room service, though we were told we could order breakfast in rather than go up to the restaurant for no extra charge. Again, the small quarters made dining en suite an unattractive option. On check in we were provided with a cable for internet connection, but the speeds were pretty slow nonetheless. I don't recall if there was a fee for service. Overall, we had a great time and would consider staying here again on a return trip to Rome, if we got a good rate.

I am one that loved this hotel. Rome was the last leg of my Italian birthday celebration and I could not have picked a more perfect hotel or location. First let me say that I did book this under the Marriott Friends & Family rate (248 \u20ac - breakfast not included) so some may say I'm a little biased but I will say, from my experience, I would have been comfortable paying up to 450 \u20ac for my room. I did receive an upgrade to an Executive Room overlooking Villa Borghese which my friend with Marriott did arrange for me...fabulous view! Upon my arrival to the room, there was a bottle of wine and a fruit display compliments of my friend...felt like royalty. Later that evening, I also received a box of chocolates and a welcome letter from the General Manager (this was in addition to the turndown service for all guests). Again, I realize my experience may have been due in large part to my friend's efforts prior to my arrival. I found the staff to be exceptionally friendly and helpful...especially the concierge. The housekeeping staff did a wonderful job. I did leave a note on my wine and fruit asking them to leave (learned my lesson when the fruit our hotel in Florence sent up was taken away the next day) and the fruit/wine remained until I finished it. This was the first hotel which had a/c and heat -- our other hotels had heat only in November (Westin in Venice, Hotel Helvetia & Bristol in Florence & Hotel Novecento in Pisa). This was a big treat for me as I do like it cooler when I sleep. Unlike previous poster, I found it very user-friendly. I didn't eat in the restaurant -- only went up there for the view -- as I knew the prices were high plus I try as a general rule to not eat in the hotels where I stay unless breakfast is included as I like to experience the city as the locals do. I actually found a wonderful bar for breakfast just around the corner from the hotel where I went every morning for my cafe and pastry...each day my greeting became more and more familiar from the owners and the bartender would start my \"usual\" when he saw me walk in. I was so sad to say my final \"ciao\" to them my last day...but I will return if the coin toss in the Trevi Fountain holds true as it did 20 years ago when I first visited Rome. Another plus to the hotel was the complimentary internet access \u2013 just had to get a code from the front desk each time. This is definitely a plus as most full service hotels charge you for internet access. I was also not charged for calling card calls from my room \u2013 again most full service hotels charge at least an access charge. Our hotel in Venice actually charged a per minute \u20ac rate even when using a calling card. My only complaints for the hotel were the drain in the shower was a little slow and the bed was softer than I would have preferred. Other than that, I was very pleased and would stay again on my next trip to Rome.

We couldn't have asked for better accommodations. We booked the Marriott Grand Flora for 5 nights, thinking that this would be the best place to stay since it was located on the Via Veneto and was rated as a Category 7.

We had dinnner 2 nights in the dining room - using points - and it was very good. The piano bar was relaxing and the bartender attentive. Our problem was the room that was assigned to us. When we were checking in, the clerk had us listed as a queen non-smoking. I had requested a queen smoking room. He was confused at this point and offered us either a non-smoking room with a view of the street or a smoking room with no view. I chose the smoking room with no view. Little did I know that this room was be so sub-standard. It was so small...much too small for 2 people...for 5 nights. I have never appreciated Marriott's taste in decor, and this was no exception. The furniture was old; the drapes were heavy brocade that were difficult to pull back to let in the sunlight, and the room was just TOO SMALL. I can understand Marriott's program of conserving energy by using the key card to activate the lights in the room. That's okay. Their idea of saving water, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. The shower only had pressure if you were using cold water. Once you turned on some heat, the pressure dwindled to almost nothing. This experience was no better than a Super 8 in the states. Back to the small room...I'm not sure if we received this room because we were smokers or because we were using points. Or is it possible that all the rooms in thhis hotel are this small? I expressed my concern to the hotel clerk after we were checked in, and he told me that there were some larger rooms, and if a room opened up, we could be moved. He told us to pack our bags so that they could move us while we were out. We repacked. Upon returning to our room, we found that we weren't moved, and nothing was said. We didn't bother the clerk again and resigned ourselves to staying in that closet of a room for the next 4 nights. He either forgot, or there was no availability (which I doubt). I'm just glad that we weren't paying the high price for this hotel. We had a wonderful time in Rome. It's just too bad that we weren't comfortable in our room, and I'm very disappointment in the Marriott hotel system.

I understood that the mix up was not his fault but his attitude toward me was terrible,(maybe he looks down at people who use points in his luxury hotel) and even after he was told by a Marriott that they found the problem he said still had an attitude.

I am a late riser and I need my coffee in the morning, but if you do not get there in time you can't get coffee to go in the restaurant so I had to order coffee from room service, which added up quickly.

The hotel found us another room at a hotel that was arguably even ritzier (Hotel Exedra), comped our breakfasts on both days, sent up wine and chocolate for us to enjoy after dinner, and upgraded our room to a Junior Suite facing Via Veneto and Villa Borghese. Our compliments to shift leader Marco Calderone who took responsibility for the hotel's error and made sure we were well taken care of. Location: Once we finally got settled into the Flora, we discovered a very nice hotel in a great location. Even though many Rome guidebooks says that Via Veneto is past its prime, the street is still gorgeous with many little sidewalk cafes and fancy hotels. I haven't always felt safe in my past trips to Rome, however I felt completely comfortable safe walking around near Via Veneto. Hotel: The hotel itself is gorgeous - the lobby and exterior are manicured to perfection. As some other reviewers have noted, the furniture in the rooms IS a little bit older, however it didn't really detract from my overall impression of the hotel. The room had some nice features I don't always expect to find in Europe - safe, actual shower curtain, wash clothes, & heated towel bar. Our Junior Suite was basic junior suite fare - one room with a bed and one with a sitting area. Great for a free upgrade although probably not worth the $200+ add'l charge over a standard room if you are paying. Having windows facing Via Veneto didn\u2019t realize bother us - it's no more noisy than staying in midtown Manhattan. Transportation: Directly across the street from the hotel is an underground tunnel which leads to the Spagna subway stop on line A. That said, the hotel doesn't really have the greatest access to public transit. It's a pretty good walk to the actual train (approx. 15-20 minute). We took taxis both to/from the train station. Other sites, such as the Trevi Fountain and Pantheon are approx. 20 minutes away on foot. We used the metro to get to the Vatican (Ottoviano stop) and Coliseum (transfer at Termini) to line B. We felt very safe on the metro - no problems with pick pockets although we were extremely cautious. I'd say the Flora is fairly centrally located to tourist spots in Rome so I doubt a cab ride just about anywhere would cost you more than 8-10 euros. Food: As noted above, we had the Flora's buffet breakfast both days. The Nutella croissants were amazing! Fresh fruit and cereal were also pretty good. Maybe not worth the 13-14 euros per day that they charge but if it's included in your room, it's a wonderful extra. Other: There' s a supermarket in the tunnel that leads to the Spagna subway stop. It's nice for picking up stuff you might have forgotten home (i.e. makeup) or other creature comforts (i.e. cheap Cokes & fruit). Overall, my wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Flora. If you want to pay for a great location at a very nice hotel in Rome, the Flora is definitely your place.", "Date": "July 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tuxedo, New York", "Title": "\u201cDecent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5410280", "Content": "My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Grand Flora as part of our honeymoon to Italy. We were previously at the new Marriott in Capri and this hotel just does not compare. The hotel room was rather outdated. We had requested an upgrade almost a year before. When we checked into our room it was tiny and they had pushed 2 beds together. We found this unacceptable. My husband was able to get our room changed. They were not that willing at first so he had to finally get a manager who then put us in a suite. It is Europe so the rooms are smaller than in the states but it was still a pretty big room. The noise from the street at night was a bit disturbing but the location of the hotel was great. Its in a very nice section of Rome. The bedding at the hotel definitley needs upgrading. The mattresses were very uncomfortable and hard. The sheets and comforter were outdated. They need to upgrade to the new down comforters. The free internet access was wonderful and it is right off of the lobby. All in all the hotel served our purpose for sightseeing in Rome but could use a fresh makeover in the rooms.

The room was a bit small, but I suppose that is Europe. The one big complaint I had about the room was that the two double beds we had were pushed together (which is common in Europe). I wouldn't mind in a three star hotel, but in a four or five star hotel, I expect enough space in the room to have the bed's spaced apart. The bathroom was very nice and was tastefully done. One huge thing that I like a lot was free high-speed internet. Europe, as a whole, just does not offer free internet in most hotels, regardless of class. That is why I was pleasantly surprised to have free internet access in the room. Did not eat in the hotel at all. When I am sight-seeing or seeing a new city for pleasure, I think the worst possible thing to do is eat in the hotel unless the dining experience at a hotel warrants a visit in itself.

This is the highest grade (7) on the Marriott rewards programme - that's 35,000 points for one night, so we were expecting the very best. It is a good standard 4* but not exceptional. We were on a Marriott deal including the breakfast which was an above average continental buffet. Staff are a bit 'hit and miss', from charming gents to grumpy old men. Service at times was poor e.g. No water in fitness room (asked twice but never arrived). Reminding staff for coffee/ toast in restaurant. Conscierge taking 2 hours to call back re restaurant booking and then being told it was fully booked. Room wasn't ready upon arrival although we were offered a complimentary drink whilst we waited half an hour. All small things that in a 3* you'd expect so if we had paid the eye watering Euro 390 per night rack rate we'd have been very disappointed. On the plus side, the Hotel is very clean and although rooms are quite small, they are well equipped with air con'. (Shower temperature couldn't be regulated and when reported it was fixed immediately). It is also well situated about 1km from Termini Station (6 Euro taxi ride) and about 400 yards (downhill) from the Spanish Steps. You can visit most of Rome's major sites on foot if you are fairly fit, as it is fairly hilly. Vatican is a taxi/subway ride away. Rome is simply fantastic.

Service was superb and the staff were very freindly and all spoke excellent english (as most Italians seem to do). Location is superb on Via Venetto next to Villa Borghese.

The hotel is halfway between two metro stops, but there is a pedestrian tunnel entrance right across the street from the hotel that takes you to the Spagna metro stop, and the Barberini metro stop is only a 5- or 10-minute walk away. We ate dinner in the hotel bar one night and the food was good but not the best we had in Italy. It was expensive; most everything on Via Veneto is and there are plenty of restaurants nearby (if you really want to splurge, Harry's Bar is right across the street). But there is a good bar/gelateria around the corner on Via Sardegna where we went for gelato, Cokes, snacks, etc., instead of raiding the minibar in our room.

Room was small by U.S. standards, but fine. Bathroom was nice. Maid service was very good, bathroom supplies (shampoo, etc.) always re-stocked. Very firm mattress. Expensive mini-bar (of course), but we just bought our own water, beer, soda, etc. and kept it in the mini-fridge. Didn't use room service, except to order ice, which was free and delivered in about 5 minutes. Used laundry service (since we got up to 60 Euro worth free with our rate) and it was done nicely and in one day. Desk Staff was friendly and pretty helpful. Doorman only opened door for us once and never had a smile; he did get us a taxi whenever we needed one (we tipped him one Euro each time for this, so you'd think we could get a smile, at least!). Room has a good hairdryer, ladies. Things you don't need to pack as they provide it: soap, q-tips, cotton balls, hand cream, mouthwash, bubble bath, shampoo, emery board, orange stick. Bring your own conditioner. Being off-season, we got a rate of about 300 Euro a night including breakfast, so it was a pretty good deal. Breakfast buffet was nice, not fantastic. Dinner was only ok in the hotel. Skip it. Bar is nice, except for the pianist/\"singer\", who is bad. Good location; lots of nice restaurants in the area. If you can afford it, go to La Pergola in the Hilton Hotel penthouse.
