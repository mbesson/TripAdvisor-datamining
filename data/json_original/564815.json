We have just returned from our honeymoon in Bali. Through our travel agent we booked into what was described on their website as a four-star hotel - Diwangkara Holiday Villa Beach Resort. We arrived early evening, and were very disappointed with our room - as a honeymoon couple, we had been upgraded to the Superior Garden Villa - three villas in an enclosed garden with a separate pool. The room was tiny, and was the width of the kingsize bed, two bedside lockers and a door to a very dingy, dirty and mouldy bathroom. Basically, the bed took over the room.Breakfast the next morning was less than average, and the buffet was left open to the elements and the flies. The hotel's beach is very small, with a very small number of sun loungers and an even smaller number of parasols.When we returned to our superior villa we found a dead rat floating in the plunge pool we'd had a dip in earlier. The manager offered us another upgrade but that wasn't immediately available, so we decided to leave.I can't comment on other aspects of the hotel - we ate dinner at a little restaurant further down the beach. The walk to the restaurant was a little bit scary as there was no lighting except from other hotels, and we were hounded a little by the local taxi drivers - until we realised they're part of the landscape there!Overall, we were extremely disappointed - our idea of a romantic honeymoon destination appeared to be ruined. But after an exhausting internet search, we finally found what we imagined a honeymoon villa should look like.", "Date": "Nov 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR654834015", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Michelle70London"}, {"Content": "Nice and quiet place My hubby and i spent 3 nites (10/6/07 til 13/6/07) there for our anniversary celebration. we had booked Deluxe Pool Villa that attached with a private pool. Generally, we very satisfy with the hotel, just hav little bit complaint that the pool and the room is a bit small.. maybe we've expected too much. other than that, wonderful. the staff are friendly, the food is nice as well (alacarte).This is not a luxuray hotel but u will feel very relax when staying there. If u expected big and nice public pool, then this won't be your choice.", "Date": "Jul 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR432204762", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "EJenni"}, {"Content": "Most Relaxed Hotel In Sanur,Bali.

A private hotel with Balinese feel and very suitable for honeymooners or anyone who prefers a quiet place. Staff very friendly and the service is prompt.
