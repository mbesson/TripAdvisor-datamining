But I don't consider this a 3.5* hotel (in fact many of the star ratings for Istanbul hotels are a bit bloated). The bathroom was tiny - I found it a bit tough to shower (and I'm not a prissy dude). Also the window was broken & didn't close - something I know the person who showed me to the room noticed (since he tried to close it) but then ignored. The room was crammed but comfortable. TV is ok. Internet ok. The area is beautiful. But this is no 3.5*. It was like an Ikea set was tossed into my room.

The room they showed us was awful with peeling paint and facing the back - claustrophobic and dingy. We paid a premium as I see some of the other travelers had done for the deluxe room on the top floor. The room was really nothing special; however, it was the view that was the redeeming factor. It had wrap-around windows with views of the Galata tower and with no high buildings across the street, the room was very bright - too bright, in fact, if you wanted to sleep in late. The location was convenient and the breakfast, although not extensive, was fine. If you can get the deluxe room, it is worth it for the view as you really get a nice feeling of the city. if not, there are better options in the city for the price range (i.e. Mia Pera).", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGot an awesome view\u201d", "Author": "LangersInLondon", "ReviewID": "UR124055265", "Content": "We booked this as it had been recommended by a friend as cheap and in a great location.

The room was easily 3 times the size of the standard and the view was just amazing! Windows all the way round with a beautiful view of the river, Galata Tower and the Blue Mosque in the distance.

First off the negatives: the room and bathroom were very small, even by European standards, there is some street noise as the hotel is located near a popular nightlife area, and there are no English language channels on the television. Now the positives: the room was clean and stylish, breakfast was decent for such a small hotel (less than 30 rooms total), and the staff spoke some English and were helpful in booking tours, even though this hotel seems to cater mostly to people visiting from other parts of Turkey. This hotel is just a block off of the main shopping street of Istanbul, with lots of nice restaurants and nice stores to choose from. It's not particularly close to any of the main historical sites, though, and it required either a taxi ride or a combination of funicular and streetcar rides to get to the main tourist areas. This is probably not a great choice for the typical tourist in town for just a few days to see the sights, but if you want to be in the Taksim area and don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room anyways, then this hotel would be okay.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cNot good at all!\u201d", "Author": "pinarpiotr", "ReviewID": "UR115050479", "Content": "We were very disappointed when we saw our room in this hotel.

If you're on a budget and want a plain room that's just for sleeping, washing, etc. and more money to spend on Istanbul then staying here makes sense. The spec of the rooms is low-ish but fine. Beds are comfortable, sheets and towels clean. One warning - if you are overweight you won't squeeze through the shower doors. There were four of us staying and we wondered how more generously proportioned people would manage. Our room faced away from the street but soundproofing's not great so we could hear conversation above, and children clumping about and squealing. Breakfast very simple. Wi-fi free and good connection. Don't stay here for a romantic break as the spec is too plain. Otherwise, it's very well-located, just next to the Tunel funicular that'll take you down to the tram for the historical sights but 5 minutes from the main drag of Istiklal Caddesi and the bars and restaurants of the Pera district. If you want the feel of a local quarter then this will be too busy an area. This was my first time in Istanbul and it's a mass consumer and mass tourist city so plan carefully if you don't like hordes of people everywhere you go. Hotel staff varied from friendly to neutral but I got the feeling that some were slightly fed-up of tourists who spoke no Turkish.

Depending on which side of the building your room is located, it can make a huge difference. The double rooms facing the street (the 01 and 02 rooms, except on 8th floor) are extremely small and very hot in the afternoon because the sun beats directly into the rooms even with the curtains drawn. There is a very tiny balcony but only enough for standing, if you can make it through the door of the balcony in the first place (because the rooms are so small). The bathroom door to these rooms work by some sort of pressure, so you need to bang the door shut in order for it to stay shut. The double rooms facing the back has a spiral staircase (we stayed in 802, as well as 503, 603) and offers a larger space and are much cooler because the sun doesnt reach here as much. The bathroom door is turn-knob and doesn't have the same problem as the rooms on the other side. However, because of the way the room is angled in an L shape, you will not be able to watch TV while lying in bed because the bathroom door is by the bed foot of the bed and the TV at the L angle. WIFI is free but if you are using Apple products you might have problem with flickering network, so u will need them to give u some code to change the dns server number or something like that. The shower stalls in all rooms are way too tiny. I am 1.73m and weight about 52kg and I have problems showering without hitting my limbs against the sliding doors (which are already damaged in the room I stayed in) or the shower head. The space is way too small. The sink is also so small, it's impossible to wash your face or brush your teeth without getting the floor wet. I am usually not picky with hotels, but this one is quite a disappointment. I don't know how much they charge per night as it was booked by our agent and included in the package price but unless it's really cheap, I don't recommend it. Location wise there are other hotels in the vicinity like Tulip Pera and Marmara Pera that offer better spots, close to the main shopping street. Staff was alright, no one to rave about. Because the street is very narrow and no parking was available outside the hotel, we had to wheel our own luggages to the pick up van further down the street when we checked out on the last day. Seems like they don't have many staff. Breakfast was traditional Turkish style, simple and good enough for us.

The Pera Hotel was not at the time I made the arrangements, because it was brand new. I decided to give it a shot though, exactly because it was brand new, and the price (at 68 euro per room per night) sounded quite tempting. Thankfully, I did not regret it. This place is rather on the small side (with only 21 rooms) but intimate. It is very conveniently located so it can be the starting point of many excursions around Istanbul. For those who know the city, it's two minutes walk from the Tunel (and therefore also two minutes away from the end of the old tramway). Also right in front of its entrance it's the gate of the brand new Sishane metro station. Location is therefore one of the strong points of this place. Another strong point (THE strongest in my opinion) is the friendliness and the service mindedness of the personnel. We were traveling with a six month old baby and we were rather worried about how easy that would be. Well, ALL the people at the hotel went out of their way to make us feel welcome and comfortable. They made us feel that it was not a professional relationship, but a genuine interest and friendliness. Anything we asked for we got with a smile. On the plus side, the Internet connection was free fast and the signal crystal clear. Our room (703) was comfortable (but the view nothing worth talking about). The water pressure at the shower was good (not to be taken for granted in Istanbul). All in all if you think about the relationship of value for money, then this is a BIG plus. On the minus side, the only thing I can find is that the breakfast place is small and the food variety for breakfast is not what I have been used to. Fresh and tasty but small variety of choices. All in all though, we have been very satisfied with our stay in the Pera Hotel and whenever we go back to Istanbul it's going to be our first choice again.
