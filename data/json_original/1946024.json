Lobby is tucked right round the back, you walk past all the bar & restaurant windows and turn the corner to finally see the entrance door. Watch out for mad cyclists, trams and cars coming from every direction! Personally I found the location a bit of a pain, you always had that 5-7 min walk after coming off a tram or train. I'd have preferred to be in the centre of the town rather than at one end. But it was easy being near the transport hub, esp for getting to and from the airport. Check in - smooth and easy. Very helpful Dominik also gave us lots of info, a useful map and of course the famous warm choc cookie! Room was ready for us even tho it was only 12.30ish. Room - we had 2 interconnecting rooms, altho bit of a glitch that it took them 20 mins to come and unlock the door! Both rms nice, one much larger as on corner. However the beds were disappointingly small, seemed like a 5' double, I think a hotel of this price range should be a 6' double, so we didn't sleep that well. Stylish furnishings, pleasant and v clean bathrooms. Not much storage space, good tea tray, metal shutters on windows bit industrial. Aircon quite noisy and gave a bright glow at night, had to stick an elastoplast over the display! We'd asked to be away from trains, and were v pleased to be on front of hotel. Would have preferred to be higher up to avoid construction works right outside. Walls thin, could hear other guests coming in at 2am. Breakfast - outstanding buffet with smoked salmon, all usual cooked stuff and in addition lovely cod nuggets. Hot choc for kids, and even warm waffles. Waiting staff so friendly. Guest Services - best feature of the hotel. All concierge staff were helpful, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, with perfect English. Paul and Akos both particularly good. They sold us I-Amsterdam cards, and tickets to museums like Van Gogh so we could avoid their queues, gave us discount cards for others, and free drinks vouchers for evening meals out. Helped plan a queueing strategy for the Anne Frank house, and successfully showed us on the map how to walk round the town while keeping our kids away from the Red Light District! Just brilliant.

We arrived around 11am Saturday morning, the hotel is just a 2 minute walk from the main train and tram station. The journey from the airport was around 10mins and only cost about 5euros each. We received an extremely warm welcome from the hotel staff, were offered a daily newspaper request of our choice, drinks vouchers and a late check out of 2pm on our leaving date. And to top that we were handed our warm cookies (amazing!) and off we went to our suite. The suite was perfect, very clean and modern, almost like we had our very own little apartment. Huge TV linked to iMac in the living room area and the bonus of a second iMac in the bedroom. Floor to ceiling windows in both the living area and the bedroom with the best views over Amsterdam. The bathroom was also very clean with a bath and shower and lots of complimentary goodies from the White Company. We didn't manage to hit the gym but did have some lovely drinks in the Sky Lounge. We chose not to have hotel breakfast either as we preferred to explore Amsterdam for breakfast instead. The hotel staff had our very best interests at heart, a quick call down to Concierge for additional coffees, milks and the famous cookies and they were there in a flash. We also needed advice for an Indonesian restaurant and Long Pura was suggested to us, we were shown details on the Internet with advice of trams to get and after we gave the green light the call was made to the restaurant on our behalf and all sorted for us (restaurant was also a big hit, thank you!!)

Having never been to The Netherlands, we felt this would have been a perfect opportunity. It was. The hotel was in the best location, clean, comfortable and the staff was great. Check-In was quick (it took longer to walk over from Central Station than to complete the check in). We had just arrived from the flight from Miami, so sight seeing was not at the top of the list that night. We dropped our gear off at the room, then went to the restaurant to grab a bite to eat. The food was great and the service even better. I had the Fish and Chips while the missus had the Curry Chicken. My dish would be more accurately described as \"a fish and some chips\". The portions were huge. I didn't even finish. The hotel is a short 2 block walk from Central Station, so trams and trains are easily accessable. It is about a 10 minute walk to Dam Square and about 15 minutes to the Red Light District, China Town and Newmarket. Most of the Tram Lines converge on Dam, so it was certainly a hub of activity. The room was well kept, although service was a little lacking. Through the 5 night stay, the bed sheets were never changed and the rubbish was never completely cleared out - the usual assortment of tissues, newspapers and empty water bottles each took a couple days to be removed from the trash cans. We had an issue with the wireless internet. It doesn't work to well in that area of the hotel (8th floor). The provided pc worked well, but our personal machines were almost useless. We had to sit in a chair by the door of the room to receive a signal. Another downside to the room pc is that it doubles as a TV, so you cannot watch TV and use the pc at the same time. This was not a deal breaker since we were on vacation, but it would have been nice to be able to do both at the same time. The bed was comfortable for the most part, although it was on casters with no locking mechanism. After the second night, we noticed it rolling around, so we wedged it into the opening of the headboard and used a towel under one of the wheels to keep it steady. The lack of a top sheet was confusing. They use a comforter as the top sheet, which combined with the unstable air unit can make sleeping either hot or cold. The air unit works, but is not fine enough to get it into a range to accomodate everyone. It has 5 settings from hot to cold. Since we were out most of the day, this wasn't that big an issue, just something to mention. An issue we did have, which is not really the hotel's fault is mystery knockers. Three nights, we had a knock at the door with no one there. Once, when I answered the door, a member of housekeeping was just down the hall. I know she didn't do it, but when asked, she claimed no ideas - it took about 15 sec to answer the door, so the assumption would be that she saw somebody. Another time, there was a knock with no one there (through the peephole), but a short time later when we opened the door, there was a bottle of water. Just strange. I do want to give props to A'kos. He is with the Front Desk Staff. We leaned on him heavily for 'touristy' questions. He was always pleasant, helpful and went out of his way to make sure all of our questions were answered. On his recommendation, we did a day trip to Brussels and were not disappointed. The Front Desk Staff were fantastic, but A'kos was exceptional.

The hotel itself is impressive, the architecture, the style, it just oozes trendiness. The Sky Lounge on the top is a must. Yes expensive, but for your first night as a little treat it is a must. The cocktails are amazing, the bar snacks delicious, the views amazing and the ambience very stylish. I must commend our barman Pierre for his great service and friendly banter. The rooms themselves were beautiful, very clean and bright with floor to ceiling glazing. One tip, with a clutter-free style they liked to hide everything away, like the kettle and hair dryer. After two days I realised that the hair dryer was hidden in the bottom drawer under the safe inside the wardrobe! The free safe was also an excellent touch. The reception staff were also very friendly, spoke very good English and will go out of their way to help.

We couldn't hear any noise from the corridor or other rooms which is always a bonus. We went straight up to the 11th floor Sky Lounge and that was awesome - pretty much 360 views over the city, and actually very affordable (about the same as London prices) with a good selection of local drinks and nice jazz/lounge music. Really a lovely place to sit, relax and chat after your flight or a hard days sightseeing. The buffet breakfast the next morning had a fantastic selection of food - a full selection of fry up hot things, a juice and cereal bar, all sorts of breads, cheeses, meats, pastries, fruit, tea coffee etc. I'd definitely recommend including this on your room price - though there is also a few cheaper room service options also available.

The two welcome drinks and daily breakfast were not written on the voucher and they were not fulfilled by the hotel. That's somewhere between $80-90 that my husband and I lost on this deal. The Doubletree sold well over 100 of these vouchers and they knew exactly what each person should receive - shame on them for not delivering what was promised. I've already emailed Living Social as well. I know this comment is very specific to me personally ... but should just serve as a reminder for anyone buying vouchers to make sure you get everything that you paid for. Now the good: You just couldn't ask for a better location. Based on the reviews here I asked for a city view/high floor. We were in room 418 so it wasn't exactly high but it did face the city and for us it was just perfect. The room was spacious and clean. The water pressure was great. We only used the Mac for TV watching as we had our iphones and ipad with us - the free wifi is priceless. One nice point of difference from other hotels - you can email something to their printer right in the lobby and it will print for you for free. We had drinks in the Sky Lounge one night and went back the next day to take pictures of the daytime view. The front desk staff were pleasant enough. About 15 minutes after we checked in a woman came by and gave us two free bottles of water - nice touch. The tap water in the hotel was great - no taste at all. We bring our own large water bottle whenever we travel and we just filled it up at the tap in the bathroom. To put everything in context - we weren't in the hotel very much so we didn't use much of the hotel's amenities ... just the lobby bar for coffee and the Sky Lounge for drinks. All in all - the reason you stay at this hotel is for its location. It is a perfect base to see everything in Amsterdam. It's a 5 minute walk from Central Station ... and that's a 15 minute train ride from Schipol Airport (I think it was 4.60 Euros per person one way).

Our return flight was in the early morning so it was great not to have to arrange transfers. Its location does mean that some of the rooms look onto the railway track. We didn't have any problems with noise although you could request a city view room if needed. The hotel is also a 5 minute walk from the main boarding point for the canal boat tours and it's easy to get around on foot - just think of the main streets as fanning out from the station, with smaller streets interconnecting, and you'll find your way home. Inside, the hotel is modern, clean and minimalist although its a bit of a walk from the lift to the rooms at the far end of the building. The staff are really helpful and had the warm cookies ready on check-in as a Doubletree standard. Rooms have comfortable beds, spotlessly new bathrooms with White Company toiletries (yes please!), but the star of the show is the iMac with free internet access, great not just for watching TV but for double checking live flight info etc. Breakfast was brilliant with a huge buffet selection of hot and cold food including smoked salmon and eggs cooked to order, and delicious coffee. They also had mineral water available alongside the fruit juices, a really small and simple thing but to me, much more convenient than having to request a glass of water from staff.

Something you should be aware of though; I'd read a lot of reviews on trip advisor of people saying they received a free bottle of wine in their room because they were there for theirs or their partner's birthday. Well we too were there for my boyfriend's birthday and although the staff knew this and even commented on it when we checked in the wine in our room was not free. There was a bottle of red with glasses on the side but we were a bit wary as to whether this was free or not so we looked in the fridge and found a bottle of white, lots of mini bottles of spirits, cans of fizzy pop and bottles of water. We wanted to be sure the bottle of red either was or wasn't for us so we rang the help desk and they told us it wasn't a complimentary bottle and it would cost \u00c2\u00a312.

Nice amount of juices, breads, sausages, eggs, potatoes, bacon, little cr\u00c3\u00aapes, mushrooms, yogurths, croissants, salmon, little chocolate things typical from the Netherlands; between so many others. - The bedroom was very clean, comfortable, well-decorated and full provided of anything you may need ranging from Listerine and little teeth-brushes to tea machine, sweets, iron and many amenities. BUT, THE ONLY FACT I DIDN'T LIKE: they have no hairdryer, which is really unbelievable in a 4* hotel; and maybe, the bed wasn't big enough even though it was really comfortable (with two different kind of pillows). - It was a perfect detail to give guests free wifi for the iMacs in everybedroom and the good disposition for everything (for example: printing. We needed to print something fastly and in 2 seconds a staff brought it to our bedroom). - THE BEST FACT: the situation. It is something wonderful to go out from Central Train Station after a long and tired travel and have the hotel in less than 5 minutes by walk on your left. The Old Amsterdam streets and Red Light district is just on the other side of the bridge (3 minutes) and you have lots of restaurants, coffes, fast-food places and so on. - We still can't believe how lucky we were as we found an unbelievably offer which gave us breakfast and bed for 85 euros with Logitravel; this means, if you find a good offer it will be perfect if not, I hardly recommend to pay for the Doubletree by Hilton becouse it has all you are searching for when it comes to travel.

We had been given a city view as per my earlier request. An hour or two after check in we got a courtesy call to check everything was ok with check in and the room, this was a nice touch. The room was not big, not small but well appointed and neat and tidy. The beds were very comfortable, we spent a lot of time sleeping in them so I can vouch for that! The bathroom had a shower only, fine for us and had White Company toiletries. We had no conditioner so I just asked the maid and she gave me one no problem, really helpful when you travel hand luggage only and are restricted on liquids. Each room has an iMac which was very handy for Internet and plugging in my iPod. I used the free Wi-Fi no problems from my phone, this was very handy. Breakfast consisted of continental and hot selection. Sometimes they were a little slow at filling up the bread etc and you had to ask them to do it but the choice was good and the food tasty. We didn't drink in the bar or eat dinner so cant comment on the food although the menu was displayed and the food and drink looked a little pricey. The restaurant was always pretty empty so maybe reducing the prices may bring in more clientele. Location was perfect, a couple of mins walk from the station and pretty close to everything else Amsterdam had to offer.

Our initial greeting was superbly professional. An immaculately groomed young man asked if he could help at all as all the reception staff were busy. When I advised him we had a reservation, he apologised that we may have to wait whilst other guests were being checked in or were checking out. We were duly seen by a young lady (who spoke excellent English) within a minute! The process was very informative, professional, courteous and personal. It made my wife and I feel like special guests. The free giant chocolate chip cookie on check in was also a nice touch and first impression. Every single member of staff was friendly, polite, extremely smart and couldn't help enough. We had breakfast every morning in the Hotel's City Cafe which was delicious and set us up perfectly for the rest of each day. The variety of cooked food, cereals, juices, fruit, breads and tea and coffee was outstanding. We had already pre-booked and paid for breakfast and although this may be cosidered expensive at the rate of 24 euros if you haven't paid and then subsequently wish to do so, you can literally have as much as you like of whatever you like! We had a superb Anniversary Dinner in the City Cafe restaurant on Tuesday evening which was not only reasonably priced but was of first class, excellent quality. Both the food and service(thank you Martiin) were exceptional. We were looked after very well. Our room was fantastic. Modern, spotlessly clean, warm, welcoming and with the imac computer and TV combination we were immensely impressed. The maid service each day was excellent and we had a call each day from a lady who came to ensure that the room service had been to our satisfaction. It had! Our room was on the 6th floor and although centrally facing (towards the inner court of the unusual hotel's shape) this did not detract one iota from our satisfaction. The Sky Lounge bar was a little expensive but this was more than compensated for by the beautiful views on a night overlooking the City, canals and surrounding buildings. The hotel is located just a 3 minute walk from the Central Rail station. The train ride from Schiphol Airport to Centraal Station could not be easier. At a cost of 4.3 euros each for a single journey ticket it was both inexpensive and took less than 15 minutes. Saves on pretty high Taxi fares so you can enjoy that superb breakfast after all! From check in to check out, our stay at the Hotel was one of (if not the very best) accommodation experiences in many years together and travelling to many Cities. If we do return to Amsterdam, we will definitely book the Doubletree again.

The Anne Frank musuem is about 15min walk from the hotel also. I reccomend a visit to the Heineken Ice Bar where you can go the 'Ice Experience' which includes a 3D show and free beer/cocktails. The Hotel Restaurant didnt have a very wide choice of variety and it was very expensive but there is also a bar where most people ate and they have a good selection of foods and its not too expensive.

Not a place I would normally choose to stay, but I figured they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have messed it up that quickly, and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.

The decor is sleek, minimalistic and the cool music in the background tells you that you are (or you want to be) in the trendy spot in town. While there was a slight confusion around our reservation, it was quickly resolved and we were all settled into our rooms quickly. The hotel has a lobby bar, a cafe and the Sky Lounge which provides some of the best views of the city. There is an outdoor terrace off of the Sky Lounge but it was too cold in January. There seemed to always be some action in the bar, one afternoon there was a band hanging out after what was clearly a late night. The restaurant was acceptable, but having only managed breakfast there one morning my experience was limited. Our first attempt to visit the SkyLounge was aborted when we tried to get into one night and were turned away. A bit strange to turn away your hotel guests, but we did manage to return later that night to a much quieter scene and again, beautiful views of Amsterdam. The rooms are small but clean (except for the accent pillow on the bed which was stained and oddly enough, never switched out). The rooms all have Macs in them which conveniently operate as a computer, your TV and a radio. The bathrooms were very modern with slate flooring and Groehe faucets. With any luck Hilton will maintain the level of service and amenities that were introduced by the Mint and it will remain an exceptional value in the city.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic.\u201d", "Author": "Hope\u2abbay", "ReviewID": "UR123516215", "Content": "This is an excellent hotel, central for everywhere in Amsterdam Rooms are lovely, but even with an upgrade they are still small.

Check in was very quick with no delays. As I've stayed in several of Amsterdams 5 star hotels I was not sure what to expect here but let me assure you if first impressions count this hotel will be a pleasure. I got a spacious room on 10th floor overlooking the City. The room also has a large balcony, yes a real balcony that you could have a party on. The room has everything I need. Its clean, bright and airy as well as having all the usual things you expect. Thankfully the safe is large enough for a large laptop (you wouldn't believe the amount of hotels I've stayed in that cant fit a laptop in the safe). Nice touch is a tooth brush and razor already in the room..(usually have to call room service for these). IMac TV is fine, but personally I prefer a larger screen...but for those of you who dont want to bring a laptop/ipad it also doubles up as a Mac computer...handy for browsing. Yes WiFi is also in the bedroom and so far its speed seems reasonable (I can use it for Netflix so connection speed is very good) Bed is perfect , nice white linen but the real bonus is that because the balcony has a full glass door I can lay down in bed and still see out to skyline and rooftops of Amsterdam. Bathroom is what you would expect for this quality standard of hotel, no bath though..I havent tried the shower yet. Hotel location is fine, (just across from the Amrath where I've stayed serveral times and always get a great room, and also close to NH Barbizon which is another decent Hotel). Ive stayed in the Krasnapolsky several times also which is in a better city center location but there the rooms are hit and miss).

Here are some of my thoughts: You can see the hotel when you turn left out of the station but there is no sign to tell you which hotel it is until you reach the front door! Arrived about 11am and could have checked in straight away but we decided to wait for a city view room, returned at 1pm and after a 5min wait were given this room - Frank that looked after us was very helpful and great customer service skills - the warm cookie was also good. Rooms are small, not much storage space in wardrobe to hang clothes! Once in our room we noticed a bottle of red wine on the shelf, then a mini fridge, fully stocked. Also found shoe polish, mouthwash, spare toothbrush etc. However, there was no information on the price of anything in the mini fridge. I requested a price list from Reception and realised you had to pay for the mouthwash etc too, this also told you to fill out a form to say what you had used - didn't have this either! However, when our adapter plug broke was great being able to borrow one from reception free of charge. Breakfast was ok, at busy times I would advise ordering your hot drinks when they seat you or you may wait a while. Also some tables are too close together! Also better drainage needed in the showers, was worried this was going to overflow! Skylounge - overpriced. 7.50 euro for less that half a glass of wine! The view is good though.

The staff at check-in were very friendly and efficient, the room was fantastic with an amazing view of the city and lots of nice touches such as an Apple iMac in the room with free internet.

In fact the lobby bar sells most of the same drinks as the Skylounge on the roof - but they are significantly cheaper. I would have given the hotel 5 stars had it not been for a visit to the Skylounge. It is a decent nightlife spot with a good view of the city but it is overpriced and more than a little pretentious. After spending 60 Euros on food and drink I clearly signed the bill and even tipped the waiter. Upon leaving we were chased by a member of hotel security who followed us into the lift and demanded to know our room number. I suppose he was just doing his job but I also notice that other reviewers have commented on similar incidents so they should really do something about how staff communicate with guests if they need to check something. Possibly they have a recurring issue with people charging to the wrong room or similar - but they handled us very poorly. Having random members of staff demand your room number doesn't seem like a smart policy for a hotel that also advises guests not to give out their room numbers for safety. So a good hotel - but with room for improvement. If they tone down the over-zealous security and realise that the rooftop bar isn't the exclusive haven that they think it is I would likely return.

You cannot miss the hotel - you turn left after leaving the Central Station and it is the first big modern block you come to. Not that attractive from the outside and seemingly no real Dutch look to it at all. The Hotel reception is spacious and very corporate. The bar is a good size and very modern in its style. Breakfast is served in the large cafe on the ground floor and we found this to be excellent...a huge choice and excellently managed when the cafe is busy. The 4 lifts serve all the floors but to access bedrooms you have to use your door key. We did find that on busy days the 4 lifts were not enough. One was always out of service. The room we had was a good size...excellent bathroom and shower. Each room has an iMac computer that has great sound quality and picture for TV too. One thing I would check if I was going to the hotel again is that the room has a view...ours looked out onto a wall...not really aproblem as in a city like Amsterdam you dont spens a lot of time in the room! However a great view would have been good. The staff at the hotel were great, friendly and efficient at all times, they made you feel welcome. The hotel has an amzing Sky Bar. Panoramic views over the town...almost worth the inflated prices but the bar does have a great atmosphere in the venings and drinks come with small snacks...it is still expensive but worth a visit.

The only negative comment I can make is that the breakfast (which did not look nice at all) was 49 euros for two people for ONE day!

And actually it was more than one. I suffer from insomnia so came downstairs to read in the lobby bar and it would seem that the mice like to come out and play (they came out from behind the bookcase) at about 5 o'clock. I did report it but the staff didn't seem too bothered and just said they would let maintenance know. Anyway, that aside it was a rather nice hotel - once we got there. We were looking for 'Mint Hotel' and there was no indication anywhere that the name had changed so we felt a bit embarrassed going into the hotel just in case it was the wrong one! It turns out the name was changed 3 weeks previously, it's a shame they didn't bother to notify us beforehand. POSITIVES: the warm cookie they give you on arrival; I asked for a city view room which we got (and the view is amazing); the iMac in the room; fluffy dressing gowns; fab hairdryer (so rare in hotels to get a decent one) and nice bathroom products. The staff were always polite. The view from the Skylounge is great but prices are extortionate so we had just one drink each. Perhaps they should consider a discount for residents? We ate in the City Cafe one evening and the food was absolutely fabulous as well as the service. I think it was 32 euro each for a 3 course menu but once we added drinks, coffee etc the total bill came to 115 euro for two of us (which was absolutely worth it for the standard of food and service). NEGATIVES: very long queues to check in and out (it took 15 min to check in, 30 min to check out); sometimes a long wait for lifts and sometimes the key card wouldn't work!; very limited tea/coffee products in the room (no milk, just 2 tiny cartons of cream - no good in tea and only enough for 2 cups of coffee); all extras are VERY expensive; a lot of talk about the 'Careline' in the literature in the room but no information on how to contact them!; the restaurants weren't open at the times stated on the key card e.g. the City Cafe is not open at 1:00 pm and the kitchens were closed at 10:30 pm, not 11 pm as stated. Overall it was nice but I'm not likely to stay there again. Even though the staff are very polite, you know that you are just a number in this big money making machine.

We booked the Double Tree as a last minute break through Expedia. On arrival at the airport we took the train directly to the Centraal Station from which the hotel is a 2 minute walk (turn left as you come out the station and it is the large, modern, glass building in front of you). Check in was reasonably. We had requested a city view room before arriving but were informed there weren't any left, which was fair enough. However, when we got to our room (munching on the delicious chocolate cookies we were given at reception), we had been allocated a twin rather than a double as per our booking. We rang down to the concierge who immediately came up and helped us move to a double, with that elusive city view we had wanted! The room was clean, comfortable and functional. Nice touches were the iMac computer/TV (which includes BBC channels for those Brits who like to stay in touch!), and the bathroom with its White Company toiletries (although note that the bathrooms are shower only). The bed was reasonably comfortable although not the best I have slept in. Good, detailed information booklets in the room and what looked like an excellent room service menu (although we didn't use this service). We also liked the ice bucket which you can fill up as often as you want from the machine next to the lift (this isn't on all floors though, the note next to the ice bucket tells you where the machines can be found). The hotel breakfast (in the City Cafe) was very good, great selection of hot and cold food and attentive service by staff for tea and coffee etc. We ate in the City Cafe for dinner on New Year's Eve as well which turned out to be a good decision (we had originally booked it as a backup as we were unsure where else we would be able to get a table in town that night). The atmosphere was perfect, upmarket but informal at the same time. The food was excellent and again the service was very attentive. There was a set menu that night but I had a look at the usual a la carte menu as well out of interest and it looked like there were some excellent options available for other nights. Throughout our stay we found the concierge to be extremely helpful and eager to please. Examples of this include booking taxis for us, advising us on restaurants for dinner, and on our travel options on New Year's Eve. The only down side for us was the check out procedure. Check out is at 12 noon. We therefore came down with our bags at this time only to find the longest queue I have ever seen for a hotel check out. The hotel does have a lot of rooms, but we have both stayed in large hotels before and never seen anything like it. We queued for about 30 minutes. There were 4 or 5 staff on the reception desk but there wasn't any sort of system for the queue. Management are clearly aware this is an issue because staff from the restaurant came round offering orange juice to those waiting - a nice touch but doesn't really address the issue properly.

The best feature was the panoramic floor to ceiling windows facing the city, St Nicholas church - beautiful at all times and particularly at night.

Check-in was warm, friendly and attentive (and the warm cookie given to each hotel guest checking in was a welcome bonus). Getting a room on the top floor was no problem. I went for an IJ river and Central Station view. If you don't like the light but constant rumble of trains go for a city view or ask for a room looking out on the inside garden. If you like trains, here you can inspect most Dutch, and some foreign rolling stock. Yes, an anorak's paradise! Hotel staff -even when just passing you in the corridor- are friendly and make you feel welcome. The nicely designed room really has everything it needs including free WiFi (and more: the Apple IMac is brilliant, but then I'm a long-standing Apple fan). As a TV, especially if you're watching it from a distance, it's not a great success. And careful when you sit on the bed, mine shot halfway across the room (obviously not on the handbrake). The SkyLounge is great for a short visit, taking in the magnificent views (especially on a sunny morning). If you really like special beers go to 'In de Oude Wildeman', near the Nieuwezijds Kolk, ten minutes on foot. And if you feel like a good curry afterwards, around the corner on the Nieuwe Zijds is the Royal Tandoori.

We were upgraded to a junior suite free of charge and the views over amsterdam were second to none- sounds perfect. And it almost was, but not quite. Firstly you have to queue forever to check in, the queues were at least ten people long when we arrived. We got to the front of the queue and were told check in wasn't until 3pm- which is quite late compared to most hotels. Anyway, we left out bags and came back at 3pm. Our room wasn't ready and they didnt have any others available so they offered us a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite, which we readily accepted. The room was brilliant, massive floor to ceiling windows looking out over the city, large bathroom, separate lounge area, was really nicely finished with a computer/tv in both rooms. We thought 'brilliant'! After about half an hour we started to feel really cold, so we put the room temp up to the hottest, but half an hour after that we were still shivering. We rang reception and were told to try another setting. An hour later still freezing, so we rang again. They sent up a maintenance guy who said that it's because reception needed to tweak the heating. They apparently did, but nothing happened. After phoning another few times over two days they sent someone up with a small electric heater which did nothing. So we spent a really, really cold three nights there. We actually avoided going back to the hotel because it was so chilly. On top of that, every time we left the hotel our lift key and room key would stop working. We'd make our way up to the room ony for our key not to work and for us to have to go back to reception. Which became pretty tiresome. When I complained about it I got no apology. When we came to check out I'd wanted express checkout. They said i'd get a statement posted under my door. I obviously didn't and had to join the ten person long queue again in order to check out, which I'd been trying to avoid. It was a really frustrating stay at the hotel. We'd stayed in the Mint Hotel in leeds and were looking forward to another good experience at this one. Unfortunately although the building was good, the stay didn't live up to our expectations.

We were allocated a room on floor 8 and it had good views and did not suffer from railway noise. Reception staff were on the ball and check in was efficient. We were offered help with taking luggage to our room but declined as we only had one small case. The room was fairly small but quite adequate for just 3 nights, storage space was sparse but we were travelling light! The room was immaculately clean and modern, (puts London city hotels to shame!) Every thing that should have worked did work. The iMac system is great. Breakfast was pretty good, lots to eat and service was friendly and efficient. The only down side was that when checking in for breakfast, we were told we were not booked in for breakfast. The matter was resolved quickly and efficiently, though it did get a bit annoying when this happened each morning. I do believe it could have been due to new systems being set up due to hotel ownership change (we checked in the Mint and checked out of Doubletree!!). (quite a bit of corporate identity changes seemed to be going on). The hotel location is a big plus, just a few minutes walk from Centraal Station, and ideally located for exploring Amsterdam on foot or by public transport. Canal cruise boats also nearby. Lots of eating places just a short walk away if you don't want to pay the quite high hotel prices for eating! Check out time was a very civilised 12-00 noon which made for a leisurely breakfast, plenty time to pack and efficiently checking out.

The tradition is to overfill your licquer glass until it forms a domiscus so that you have to lean over to take the first sip before picking it up. Tips - If you are returning to the airport by train, call into the information booth at the station the day before to check. We came home on a Sunday and there was work being carried out on the line which meant changing five minutes out of the Central Station. Without being forewarned it would have been a panic.

It also means that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re located right by a central hub for trams, taxis, and buses and that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be in a place where you can easily walk to attractions such as the Anne Frank house or Rijksmuseum. The hotel is brand new and it shows in the furniture and fittings that have been used. Rooms have an iMac that can be used as a computer (obviously) or to play the DVDs that the hotel makes available free of charge. The iMac is also used as a TV so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a smaller screen than the usual flat-screen TV that now seems to be the norm for hotels. Both wired and Wi-Fi Internet access is free. The Wi-Fi signal was good for PCs, iPhones, and iPads throughout the hotel. The hotel personnel are cheerful and made checking in an easy process, even though we arrived before noon. Everyone seemed pleased to help, which is a nice change from the dour attitude that is sometimes met in other hotels. We had a room overlooking the canals and Central Station square. The rooms on the other side of the hotel overlook the railway line, which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so attractive. In our case, we could still hear the noise of the trains as they passed over a steel bridge en route into the station until approximately 1am. The rooms are small and compact, which is what you expect in a city center hotel, but they are comfortable and clean so they are a nice place to spend a couple of hours relaxing while you figure out what to do next in Amsterdam. The beds are very firm and seem to be a small queen rather than king size, which might be important to some. Like many hotels the contents of the mini-bar should be avoided unless you delight in spending large amounts on items such as EUR4.50 for 0.5L of water (sparkling or flat). There are supermarkets close to the hotel where you can stock up on items at a more appropriate price. The breakfast buffet is a tad expensive at EUR24/head (the continental breakfast is EUR14/head). Cheaper breakfasts (less than EUR10) can be found if you take a short walk across the bridge in the direction of Dam square or you can grab a pastry and coffee in the Central Station.

Food in the hotel is very expensive but there are lots of good places to eat nearby but watch out for one or two the shops over the bridge almost opposite the hotel as they overcharge greatly. For example a grocery shop beginning with \"L\" opposite charged 8 Euros for one packet of crisps and 2 milky way bars!! So watch out! The best thing to do is stock up on provisions from the supermarket situated in the station, can't remember the name but know the initials are AH. The hotel is a non smoking hotel but whilst we were there someone was probably smoking in their room which set off the fire alarms which meant everyone having to leave their rooms.

When I arrived in the location recommended by Google maps there was no sign of the hotel! It took me over one hour to find the hotel. I walked there, (it was quite near). When I reached the hotel a member of staff explained to me to drive into the underground parking (the parking was not marked as the Mint Hotel). This got me to a basement door (not properly in operation) and it cost me 12 euros for the very expensive parking just to unload my car! (I had to go out again in the car later that day. I parked it finally at my work destination and came back on the tram! Then, I learned that actually you CAN drive to the front of the hotel to unload. I paid 12 euros for nothing. The staff didn't know how to direct me so they just told me to go to the car parking beacuse it was easier for them. I think the staff should really know about their own hotel and how to reach it!! This is truly unbelievable for me. Check in was very slow. Maybe it was the first day at work of the booking clerk, I don't know. But this took me nearly half an hour. Then I got into the elevator and it didn't work! It didn't go up to the room. I tried anohter elevator. Same problem! Then, another guest told me to put my room key in a little slot near the ground. (less than 1 metre from the ground) This makes the elevator work. I never heard of this system before. I met several other people who were having problem with the elevator and I had to explain to them what to do. But it should be the job of the slow check in clerk to tell me important things like this. I had already spent an hour trying to find their hotel because nobody thought to tell me there was construction work when I booked. What are these staff trained to do? When I reached my room it was quite pleasant, and modern, it had an apple computer and free wifi. Nice bathroom, all new but shoddy. My drawer did not close properly even though it was brand new. And then, no sound insulation! it was like sleeping IN the railway station. :) The price is not cheap for this hotel. Yes, it's a really good location. The breakfast was very good. The staff, though inefficient, were friendly. It was nice and clean. But is it worth this price? I don't think so.

When four of us had lunch upon arrival, three of us got our food and the fourth person had to wait FOREVER for a Caesar salad. Annoying... - It's not finished! The hotel is still being worked on!

The rooftop 'sky bar' is the real icing on the cake for this hotel though - it seems to be a very cool destination and is probably as good as it gets view-wise in the city, though on the downside there seemed to be a big corporate-banking function going on there on one night that excluded hotel guests, which we didn't appreciate. We didn't bother with the expensive breakfasts as there are plenty of good places to get good food & coffee close to the hotel - particularly the excellent 'Winkel' bakery/cafe. In all, we'd highly recommend a stay here.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgrade", "Title": "\u201cToo expensive for a quite basic hotel\u201d", "Author": "EstebanBelgrado", "ReviewID": "UR119007947", "Content": "Good points: - Very central - 50m from Central Station, 100m from the Red light district, 500m from Dam square - Clean - Apple computer/TV in every room - Good and fast service - Sky bar with a great view on the top - Free Wireless Not so good points: - Many rooms overlooking railways - DO NOT TAKE THEM!

My partner and I decided to head over to Amsterdam (our first time can you believe!) for 4 days during the middle of August and had a thoroughly enjoyable time over there, helped by the fact that we stayed in a fantastic hotel. The Mint Hotel, which is located only minutes from the Amsterdam Central station was clean, a stress-free experience, with service that was very helpful and friendly. We touched base with Daphne before we arrived in Amsterdam to request a quiet room with a good view, as well as gathering information from their Concierge on recommended activities for both us to do during our short stay there. Both of these requests were handled by them and we indeed got provided with a fantastic room giving us a view of the main town across the river with no noise distraction. The availability of having a Mac in all rooms was also an added bonus, which now makes me think why other hotels don't have something similar to this as it is something which is far more useful than you would think! Watching TV, surfing the net, and hotel information all on one device. One thing I recommend to people staying in the hotel is to check out The Sky Lounge - a spectacular place at the top of the hotel to relax and/or unwind after a long day out and about the town and can see why it is a popular setting! Overall, our stay at Mint Hotel was fantastic and will definitely be looking to stay here again on my next trip there. Another tip for those staying here is to book the hotel bicycles in advance of checking in. Amsterdam is a popular bicycle city, probably one of the best (if not THE best!) in Europe, and thus are in big demand. Unfortunately, there were none available to book when we were there, but we booked with a local rental company and only wished we hired earlier to use around the City!", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNice, modern hotel - still getting the kinks out\u201d", "Author": "dianet123", "ReviewID": "UR118939498", "Content": "This hotel is quite new, the facilities are clean and modern, and the views are fabulous.

Though it is not really in a neighborhood (it is near Central Station, across the tracks from all of Amsterdam), the location was OK, because of the view and also because the trams all converge on Central Station, so it is easy to get almost anywhere in town. On the downside, when I was there the hotel was understaffed. The first day, my room did not get cleaned until I returned back in the evening and called down to request it. Even on later days, cleaning did not occur until very late afternoon - often at a time that was inconvenient for me. There was usually a bit of a wait at the concierge desk, and the quality of the staff was mixed - they had some excellent people, and also some who were not very helpful at all. and some design elements were just not well thought out.

After a few minutes the elevators started and we took one up to the eight floor. On the way up the alarm started in what I assume was the fifth floor as we were passing. That's not a good feeling when you are going up.

He said we could go back to our room as the alarm only went off on the floor that would have an actual fire. As far as I know the alarm usually goes off in the entire building to alert everyone. This was not reassuring. We took a quick check in the hallway and stairs to see if we could smell any smoke and waited 15 minutes in our room to be ready if the alarm came on again, witch it didn't.

Also in the room is an iron and an iron bad, and a little office desk. The breakfast was more that enough for us: you have a tray with 3 kind of cheeses, 5 kinds of cold Meets such as pastrami, salami, prechuto, bacon etc', you have 2 kinds of sandwiches( one croissant with tomato, butter and cheese, and one with tomato and lax), you have 4 kind of breads, some crackers, brioche, muffins, fruit salad, fruists, plane yogurt, muzzli, dried fruits, cereals, milk, fresh squeezed orane juice grapefruit and apple juice, tomato juice, jams, honey, basically you don't need more, Location: when you cross to other side of the road, you get to the bars, coffee shops,restaurants, everything is there. Dam square is 3 minutes walking, you don't have to take any tram, just walk to the other side. One tip!!! The central station is right next to the hotel, you have resturnts,burger king, Starbucks, supermarkets, everything you need there, the city is very expensive, and there you can fibe cheeper things.

We were a big family so we had a few rooms booked at this hotel. When we arrived, we didn't have much of a first impression, other than the fact that there were still some construction around the area, and that the main entrance was at the back where we had to pass some construction looking area, but I'm sure that'll get cleaned up soon. When we proceeded to check-in, it was very crowded. I think there was a tour checking in or checking out right before us, so that was quite a wait. The interior lobby is very modern, not the classic stuff that you'll see in Paris, but very clean and new, which is what we were looking for. The hallway of the rooms or the lift didn't scream luxury, they were in fact very basic. The rooms also had that same theme but there were a few things we really loved about the hotel rooms. First of all, the iMac desktop each room had. The system was nice, you could watch TV, surf the internet, play music, etc from the desktop, it was very easy to use and a really nice touch. The free wi-fi in every room was also a huge plus. I think hotels that charge for internet are very outdated, so this should set a good precedent. Service in general was top notch. They had receptionists of various nationalities all speaking very good english and were very helpful, even though the hotel was often crowded with people checking in or out. The breakfast was excellent. They didn't have huge varieties, but everything they had was good quality and very generous. It was buffet style, and for drinks you could have coffee, tea, hot chocolate, or any of the fresh juices on tap. If you book this hotel, you should get the breakfast included, it really makes your day, and starts it off well. The bathroom was very minimalist, but most importantly, was spotless and clean. In fact, you couldn't tell that its ever been used, which was perfect. They had pump liquid soap for shower which was a nice touch. It doesn't have a bathtub and was compact, however it was sufficient. Location was also good, 5 minute walk to Central Station which is the hub of Amsterdam. And calling taxis was easy and convenient. Trams and buses are also nearby, giving you many options for transportation. The Sky Lounge was decent but didn't really eat or chill there so can't really comment. If I had any complaints, it'd be the following : The gym was alright, didn't have any windows, so running on the treadmills, you'd be facing a concrete wall. And it isn't as nice as those 5 star hotel gyms in Asia, but then again, Mint isn't a 5 star typical hotel, its more of the high-tech boutique hotel of modern feel. Secondly, I don't think there was a pool, so that was that. Overall, loved this hotel, really made the Amsterdam visit very pleasant. I had walked past a few other hotels nearby with good locations, they were all very dated. This was really the best option if you're looking for a clean and new hotel, one where you'd happily step on the carpet or the bathroom barefeet without that instinctive desire to curl your toes to avoid grimes. Definitely recommend this to any Amsterdam visitors. P.S. The Guest Services were also awesome, they had tickets for any shows or daily excursions, and they handled restaurant reservations very efficiently. I don't know if Dutch efficiency is the reason, but this Hotel was definitely very timely and efficient in their service.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "VC", "Title": "\u201cNo doubt recommending Mint Hotel Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "rpmartins", "ReviewID": "UR117363134", "Content": "On arrival, stands out the very impersonal style of the lobby, with a colder ambiance than an airport. Staff is dressed in black with (few) green stripes that give the impression they are soldiers of Mint\u00c2\u00b4s army, but the reception\u00c2\u00b4s service is very good in very well spoken english, guessing what we wanted without needing to ask, like taking care of luggage after checking out till departure time. All common spaces were clean but some specific zones looked like they were in repair works: air ducts visible, puddles on the tile floor near big windows, elevators hall being painted in the afternoon, but nothing that interfered with the functionality. First impression of the room was very good: spotless and with sober decoration. WiFi works very well and the hotel's Mac with radio and TV broadcast with remote control is useful and looks nice with the decor. Our room overlooks railway lines, but it\u00c2\u00b4s almost at the same level of the trains (3rd floor) and I expected noise. Really it was no outside noise at all, because the thick glass walls and the unique small window that could be opened and closed closed the external sounds, like trains or music in the courtyard, were muted and we could \"enjoy\" the continuous murmur of a ventilation or any other system different than the AC in our room, because with the AC switched off the sound continued without interruption. Air conditioning system should be malfunctioning because always produced a light cold breeze even in the hottest position. Fortunately the air openings aren\u00c2\u00b4t over the bed and the room was comfortable with the AC off, so it didn\u00c2\u00b4t became a problem. The morning we checked out the AC panel is blinking, probably informing that is really damaged. The bed mattress is too smooth for my taste, giving the feeling of sinking. I prefer stiffer ones. The pillows are very good. I need to be well covered while sleeping otherwise I get cold very easily. Nevertheless the bed cover was very very hot, making me sweat with t-shirt and shorts pajamas. Should be excelent for winter but not for summer nights, dispite the rain and the 14\u00c2\u00baC temperatures in the outside. Right in front of the glass walls of the bedroom there is a courtyard with ambient music being played, accessible from the third and fourth floor. Could be used to breath fresh air or to smoke. It\u00c2\u00b4s all uncovered so it\u00c2\u00b4s a useful place if it isn\u00c2\u00b4t raining.

Only flaw was the housekeeping of the bedrooms. We left our room at 11am on the first day and got back at 5pm to find out room still hadn't been cleaned and towels not been replaced etc. The cleaner knocked on our door at half past 5 to clean the room which we turned away because we were relaxing before going out for the evening and only got her to replace the towels. The next day we got back at 6pm and the room had been cleaned and beds made etc but small things like replacing the used dirty glasses with new clean glasses and leaving extra toilet roll hadn't been done.

I made the booking based on the recommendations of other Trip Advisors and thought I'd leave some leeway for service being a little below standards due to the fact they were new. But they pushed the bar even lower! My wife and I booked a Club Room with a Balcony. Upon arriving at 10am our room was not ready (which we were fine with) and we were given a voucher by Frank (who was very nice) to sit in the city caf\u00c3\u00a9 and have a drink while we waited 20 minutes. That 20 minutes turned into 6 hours!! We ventured into the city and got absolutely soaked, came in dripping to find that now at 4pm (well after check-in time) our room was still not ready. So, Mandy and Frank at the front desk did the right thing and upgraded us to a Club Suite. The Club Suite was clean and came with fruit and water (minus the bottle of bubbly Frank mentioned we'd get because it was my birthday but hey ho). But from here the service just continued downward. We asked for our room to be tidied. We walked past the cleaners at 3pm expecting that they'd been. We had to call to ask for service and the cleaning staff waited until 5pm to tidy our room and once they did, they put the fruit discards and plates outside our door and there they sat for 24 hours! When they finally took the plates (after a few phone calls) they took the cutlery and set it on the windowsill outside our room. It was still out there when we checked out! May I remind you, these rooms are one step down from their super-swanky City Suites with massive balconies. You'd expect at least good service in this level of suite. I understand they are a young hotel but 4 stars is a huge reach! Excellent front desk staff, great location, poor cleaning and floor management. At 4 stars, you'd at least get a turn-down service in the evening... nothing! We did get a random guy at 10am, knocking because he wanted to inspect our minibar, I asked him to wait until we'd left for the day.

At checkin , at 6pm, the room was not ready, so after a bit of hassle and arguing, the room was suddenly declared clean and we were given a few drink vouchers for the bar at the top. Nice gesture. All in all, good hotel. (and yeah, parking costs 45per day... But that is Amsterdam!

We booked the hotel on a special deal as they were obviously trying to encourage visitors as it's such a new hotel. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly, we checked in quickly and were given a room when we arrived at 10am, which was great. The room is lovely, it felt like we were the first people to use it! Being new, it was immaculate - super comfy bed, great shower, tea facilities, bath robe, safe, etc. Views could be good depending on location, we could actually see into other rooms out of our window, which isn't ideal. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel because it wasn't included in our package and was VERY expensive (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac16 for continental, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac26 for cooked...crazy!). The location is good and bad - very close to the main train station, so excellent for coming in from the airport, but that is also the furthest north you're likely to want to visit in the city, so for the southern attractions, eg Van Gogh museum, it's quite a way. We were happy to walk everywhere, but it was a good half an hour to the southern side of the city. The Sky Lounge bar on the top floor of the hotel is AMAZING - you should visit even if you aren't staying at the hotel (which you can) as the views are the best. Brilliant at night looking out over the city. Overall, we would visit this hotel again at the price we paid, but I don't know how likely that would be! We definitely wouldn't pay more.

It felt like we were the first to sleep in our room, which was nice. We had two rooms next to eachother with a connecting door. This is far better than a regular family room, we usually get with in most cases extra beds of lower quality cramped into it. We had a quite big room for ourselves (817) and a smaller one for our children (818). The rooms had a panoramaview on the city which was very nice to just look around at night. I suppose there are rooms on the backside (where the trains pass, so ask for a frontal room). We arrived a quarter of an hour early and got a welcome drink at the bar. In the meantime they brought our luggage to the room. During unpacking room service brought over 2 bottles of water, which was very considerate considering it was rather warm in Amsterdam. Breakfast was ok, being included in the price. When I would have paid seperatly for it, probably I would be somewhat dissappointed (16 euro/person). There is a possibility to have warm extras (scramled eggs, sausages,...) for a 10 euro surcharge. I did not witness anyone opting for it. At the buffet you'll find cereals,juices, pastry, fruit, yoghurt,... The only way you can clearly see that the hotel has just opened is the different standards of experience of the staff. The fact that there is a IMac on the room that can also be used as tv set worked out fine for us. The kids (7 & 9) played some online games as we rested a bit. For Belgian clients, there are no Belgian tv-chains available (which you will normally find in the Netherlands). No real problem for us. You can follow some stuff via streaming (I followed soccer Belgium-Turkey via radiostream). For guests coming by car. Parking can become very costly in Amsterdam. We parked our car at P+R Zeeburg which is just a 10 minute tram ride to Central Station (which is litterally next door). They charge 8 euro/day and you get a return tram ticket for max 5 persons. All this would normally make me quote the hotel at least very good. Why Average? Their administration is not up to the standards of a 4-star. First I had to renegociate a rate I found on the Mint-website. But as I was open for a compromise we managed. What really is unacceptable is that after our stay they asked by mail for a confirmation that they could charge our creditcard. They said they forgot on checkout. No problem. I pay for what I have gotten. When my creditcard details arrived suddenly we seemed to have been charged two times. Ok, they paid it back with excuses but I think compensation would have been appropriate.

The only downside was the Skylounge, which despite being great to look at, the service was slow and a bit iffy.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nantwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent modern hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ELLEN130785", "ReviewID": "UR115589318", "Content": "We have just returned from a four night stay at the mint hotel,absolutley thrilled with our time there.

After having trawled my way through various hotels in amsterdam i found one which meets most if not all of the requirements. The hotel is situated just around the corner from central station approx less than 5 mins walk - easy to spot. The check in was a bit slow however they were quite busy. The hotel has good sized rooms some people have moaned there is no room between the bed and the wall to walk - this is not true. The rooms are a good size. There are the things you would expect from a hotel but dont necessarily get in Amsterdam - such as a kettle with TEA and milk (not creamer), an apple mac computer which also is a tv, a power shower, an iron and ironing board, room service, a mini bar - though i have to say some of the prices are expensive - this isnt really a problem as you can buy most things from the train station anyway (albert heijn the supermarket is also here). My room didnt have a splendid view all i saw was a corridor so i complained and was told ill be moved tomorrow to a sea view. The sky bar at top floor has a splendid view. Staff are well mannered and polite and quite accommodating. The hotel only opened in late May 2011 therefore there are some tweaks which are required. I told them i was a business customer who travelled to amsterdam every two weeks, however there wasnt much of an effort made to value my custom - i put it down to lack of experience. All in all based on my experience of hotels in Amsterdam (ive stayed in the basic to the top ones) I would definitely say this is my number one - best for location, slightly higher prices than others, however you get all the stuff you would expect from a hotel so there is nothing really to disappoint you. I would definitely recommend this.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLovely, clean, modern hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Starlight1985", "ReviewID": "UR115492963", "Content": "Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for one night on Saturday. We were very impressed with the location, the hotel is right beside the train station and very close walking distance to main attractions in Amsterdam. We stayed in a club balcony room and it was amazing, we were on the 8th floor an our balcony was huge! It overlooked the best view of Amsterdam. The room was spacious and clean with a lovely big bed, the bathroom had a separate shower and bath. Best of all the room had a free iMac to use and free wifi throughout the hotel. The only negatives I would have to say about the hotel would be that the reception were very slow on check in and check out, staff were very apologetic about this and as it is a new hotel I presume this will improve over time. The desk staff were very accommodating when ever we spoke to them and gave us use of umbrellas when we were heading out for the night as it rained all Saturday. Be sure to hang your \"do not disturb\" sign on your room door as between the hours of 9.30-11 am housekeeping came into the room twice. I would advise checking out early as at 12pm the queue was extremely long but we were in no hurry to leave Amsterdam as we did not have flights to catch. Staff offered to hold our bags and we came back to the hotel to check out once the queue had eased.

The Mint Hotel is newly constructed; located a 5 minute walk from the central tram station. And another 10 minute walk from the main activity areas of Amsterdam. The corridors to the rooms are long & narrow. There are almost 100 rooms per floor. The rooms and bathrooms are tiny but efficient. In general, the rooms, bathrooms, and hotel spaces are very clean. If you are looking at the most basic room, expect about 4 inches separation between the end of the bed and the wall. The beds are close to the ground and the sheets are rough. A huge plus is the the free wifi throughout the hotel and a free to use Mac in your room. It doubles as your TV screen and general information center. I read a review that said the Mac was difficult to use. I found it user friendly. Breakfast was included in my room rate. The variety of food provided was appropriate. Not lavish. Some Glitches: 1. Upon check-in the reception person was providing a lesser grade room than what we'd paid for and then said breakfast was not included. After my correcting, they reassigned the room and included breakfast. 2. Breakfast Area: The hotel needs a bigger area to accommodate the breakfast items, more staff, and fix the load slamming door staff goes in & out every 5 seconds. 3. Guest Services desk needs more than 2 people to man it. There are simply too many guests needing help at any particular time. Additionally, the Guest Service personnel need more training or experience. 4. On our last day, housekeeping never made it to our room. Beds were never made and had use our towels from the previous day. Also, room service trays are frequently left 24 hours in the hallway.

I heard about the mint hotel and their supposedly superb roof terrace... I must say the view is breathtaking but that is all. It took more tan 20 min for a waiter to arrive.. So we asked for a menu (why arent these on the table?) then it took another 10 minutes to get it. The first time he arrivd we asked about the free wifi, how it worked and if we needed a code... He didnt know and would ask a colleague. The colleague never came back nor did he. We asked another waiter again 10 minutes later, she didnt know and finally another colleague gave us the answer, it is free withouta code......was that really that hard to tell?!?!? Then looking at the menu, alcohol free cocktails for 10 euros, would you like champagne inn them it is 17,50 euro, these are prices for upper class establishments, i have no problem with that but make sure that the service is upper class as well. We ordered simple sodas and even in an airplane they are served with more flair. I ordered tomato juice, the bartender premixed it spicey, which was very nice, but the drink was served without a slice of lemon, no coaster or napkin etc.... It is just not what i expect looking at he prices on their menu. Also the huge amount of touists just coming up to look at the view.... Imagine you sitting their trying to be posh with you 17,50 champagne cocktail, being run over by kids, staff taking 30 minutes to come at your table.... You must admit the prices are complete out of proportion. I would advice a sign saying: entrance for guests only.... We were sitting next to a huge latino family wit kids playing all over the place.... It just doesnt mix in with the guests you try to sere (looking at your menu) and please teain the staff about the wifi for instance.... How com nobody knew the answer to such a simple question? Also some umbrellas would be nice and maybe some decoration. I do understand you just opened so i hope this is just some start up problem.... On the other hand, you re already serving guests so make sure they get a nice experience wouldnyou want them to come back.....", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Doubletree by Hilton Hotel Amsterdam Centraal Station", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1946024-Reviews-Doubletree_by_Hilton_Hotel_Amsterdam_Centraal_Station-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$175 - $562*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Oosterdoksstraat 4</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1011 DK</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> (Formerly Mint Hotel Amsterdam)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1946024", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b3/88/b388345ea37dc381ea1765cd5c63a3bd5large.jpg"}}
