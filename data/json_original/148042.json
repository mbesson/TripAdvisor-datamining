I read a few reviews of pricey food especially, YES, this is a resort, and priced accordingly. All resorts typically do not have bargains when it comes to food-service, not even breakfast! Do not expect low-priced fast-food walking distance either, although there was one food-cart vendor on the edge of the property with \"modest\" priced American type foods. The ocean-view room is furnished in modern style. Ours was a king bed and approx 400s.f. We stayed on the 8th floor with a balcony. BALCONIES ARE VERY LIMITED on this property. DO NOT EXPECT one! I had to insist on the phone to make sure I got a balcony. I booked directly with the hotel, and rec'd this way only. Look @ website, then call!!! I had none of the hassles a few reviewers wrote on getting a room type. The beach is great, the pool area can fill fast, but it's best to really experience the ocean setting, and sit on a lounge on the sand, and all still very close to the pool and bar/towel services areas. NICE staff all-over, and consistent. No big \"gripes\" and best for singles, couples, and older-families with kids 12+ years. Room-service was always quick, and good. Be aware hotel is VERY CLOSE to airport, which is good and bad. If any type of jet-noise bothers you, you might want to go elsewhere. If your room faces away from ocean, you might just look @ the end of a runway of SJU. Typically while INSIDE THE HOTEL you won't hear anything, but during the day while on the beach, you will hear and see the jets on takeoff.

The facilities and grounds are in great shape. The lobby lounge seems to be a popular evening gathering spot for dinner or night cap. The food is very good but as expected on the pricey side. I'd recommend walking a block or two to Platos or Metropol for some authentic Carribean cuisine. The beach is not overly crowded though the surf is rougher than other beaches. In fact just down a few hotels, folks are surfing. The hotel is almost located next to the airport. While you can hear jets periodically, I did not find it bothersome. It is $15 taxi ride to the airport and $20 to Old San Juan. There is Enterprise Rental Car on site. Tip, reserve the car on the internet and pick it up. If you walk up and reserve, it cost alot more. In fact, this may seem to be a hassle, if you have to reserve multiple days, it might make sense to reserve by the day.

The beach is sort of unfortunate - it is rather small, and while we were there, it was covered with seaweed. I had hoped for better. The casino is fine - small but adequate. We ate at Il Mulino, which was very good, but it is true that the hotel has no food offerings that even remotely reflect the cuisine of the area. Metropol across the street isn't bad if you are looking for more traditional Puerto Rican fare. The hotel itself is clean, rooms are fine - no real problems there. The service is average, but in no way exceptional. We also found the breakfast at Mares to be really greasy. It's a nice hotel. Nothing wrong with it, per se, it's just that we were expecting something a little more relaxing, and with better service than we received.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBeatiful property, WAAAAAY too many kids EVERYWHERE!\u201d", "Author": "Jen B", "ReviewID": "UR126763736", "Content": "I was excited to stay in one of the nicer rooms and enjoy the Club Level amenities.

DO NOT let the proximity to the airport scare you. The windows are double glazed and we only heard the airplane traffic in the quiet hours of the morning faintly. We also never heard the casino once. The grounds are some of the loveliest we have ever seen. Very well maintained. The pool area is crowded, but the attendants will quickly find you chairs if asked. The beach is great, plenty of towels, ice water and attention. The restaurants are limited and the service was spotty. Only poolside service and a breakfast/lunch dining room open to 4pm. For dinner, two upscale restaurants Il Mulino and BLT--both delicious but expensive. There are many other local places within safe walking distance such as Metropol, Mi Casita and Don Jose--cheap, tasty, local food. The public beach also has a kiosk with delicious empanadas for $1.00! There is a great spa/gym with plenty of equipment and free classes with a tough, but effective trainer named Josue--loved the spinning, total body fitness and ab workouts. Two tennis courts-free.

The beach is public, so you don't have the sense of serenity and privacy found at a Ritz Amelia Island or Grand Cayman, especially on the weekend.

The pool food was a negative - I can't recall ever having a bad meal at a Ritz until I ate here. The mojitos are excellent & prosecco is probably the best value if you are drinking wine on the beach ($18 for a glass of sauvignon blanc?). However, room service and the lobby bar had excellent food. The Lobby Bar is a gorgeous space with terrific sushi and some decent wines by the glass, and a safe place for a single woman. Can't speak to the casino, which I avoided. It seems at odds with the Ritz glam to have a casino off the lobby. But I can recommend the handrolled cigars sold by a gentleman at the casino entrance! The massage I had at the spa was fine, but again, service wasn't on par with other locations. The spa is only accessible by walking outside, so arriving during a rainstorm was not a relaxing start to my spa time.

It is literally five minutes from the airport, but the intersection leading into the hotel has about six different ways to go; it can be confusing. The hotel is directly opposite your car when you come to the first red light. The grounds and pool are pretty. The dining options, as always, are limited. There is a Denny's around the corner which helps. BLT is ok....but I was disappointed in the limited offerings. I can't eat steak every night. We had an ocean view double room. Nothing spectacular, but rumor is that they are remodeling/redecorating. Right now, it is very sunny yellow caribbean decor. They are very proud of their casino. If you have traveled to Vegas, it feels like a small vegas strip hotel. Don't waste too much time in the hotel. Get out and see the island. I rented a car and had the standard Ritz valet parking fee. But, if you have a car, then you are free to get out and explore the island. Driving to San Juan is easy and only crowded during rush hour...so don't let that worry you. It is worth getting into San Juan. Do Not miss the two castles/forts. They are a kid's dream. Lots of turrets, and tunnels, and hiding places. Back to the hotel. Decent beach for Puerto Rico. This is NOT the white sands of the bahamas. If you have limited funds, stay at the Courtyard just further east and you'll be on the same beach. It has a rapid slope, so more for sunning than swimming. I was disappointed at the service at the beach. The young staff was more interested in chatting among themselves rather than checking on us. The entire staff needs to be trained better....but again, this is Puerto Rico. This is funny: the concierge will give you printed out directions to locations/sites around the island. The directions are written poorly, are confusing, assume too much and are pretty much worthless. Although the concierge staff tried, they just don't get it! Nevertheless, go to Arecibo, the observatory, and visit the caves, and check out Luquillo beach, and the restaurants in San Juan, and drive around.

The hotel would benefit from hiring a few staff to do nothing but clean up glasses around the pool, pick up room service trays outside doors, move wet towels. And, it rains in Puerto Rico....a lot.

They service your room twice a day so it is always clean. The servers in the restaurant were all great. Shout out to the omelet chef Jeremy (at Mares breakfast buffet). He loves his job and made awesome omelets as well. The beach guys set-up a chair wherever you want one and will get you an umbrella as well. I honestly have no complaints at all about the staff. As for the rooms. I would give them just an average rating. For the price you pay to stay here you would expect a soaking tub and a larger room overall (I have stayed at many resorts for half the cost of what I was hearing people paid that are twice as big as the rooms here). The beds are extremely comfortable. Our view was just of the parking lot so nothing fancy there. For as nice as everything else is at this resort I would have expected more space.

Third, the concierge messed up our dinner reservations twice - booked the wrong time at BLK, and never made us a reservation at Il Mulino (even though we had the confirmation in writing). They tried to make up for it by seating us outside the restaurant by a very noisy casino - though they did comp us with a free bottle of wine, coffee, and desserts. Fourth, the bathrooms by the pool and lobby were a disgrace - unclean and not properly stocked. Fifth, service in the lobby lounge for dinner was extremely slow and the servers mixed up our orders. Sixth, this was not a kid friendly hotel - aside from some pretty sad inflatable water-slides outside the pool, one ping pong table, and a volleyball net in the pool, there were no other programs or activities for kids. The hotel was definitely not worth the price we paid.The only pros of the trip were - the beautiful weather, close proximity to the airport, snorkel trip aboard the Spread Eagle II, and the homemade chocolate chip cookies in the lounge..Save your money, and stay at another spot.

I have no problem with the room tax, which added around 13% to the room charge. But then there was a compulsory daily \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort fee,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd whatever that covered, which added another 16% -- even though I was attending a conference and had no time to use any resort facilities outside the meeting rooms. I always tip the bellhop and housekeeping staff personally, so imagine my surprise when I saw that the hotel had also added very generous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bellmen gratuities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and smaller daily \u00e2\u20ac\u0153housekeeping gratuities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the final bill. I suspect that the chances of that money going to the service staff who actually helped me (and whom I already tipped directly) are slim to none. Unlike most good hotels I have stayed at and even many bad ones, the Ritz-Carlton San Juan offered no daily newspaper to its guests. But when I inquired, the helpful reception staff directed me to the gift shop, where I could buy a Wall Street Journal for $4.82 (including tax) on weekdays and $$8.56 on Saturday for a slim edition strangely stripped of the usual weekend WSJ magazine section. The printed price tag on the newspapers was $2.00, carefully covered up by a gift shop mark-up sticker. Not much money involved, but still an egregious rip-off. The room was large but nothing special, with no balcony and a view consisting mainly of a nearby building across the street. The thermostat apparently controlled only the air-conditioning, so there was no heat on a cold February night. On the plus side, maid service was excellent, the reception staff was friendly, the wi-fi worked well, and the three-drawer dresser was adequate. But overall, the facilities were unimpressive despite the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beach location and beautiful ocean setting. The Ritz-Carlton San Juan is not a great place to hold a conference. The hotel did not provide paper, pen, or pencils for attendees at the conference sessions, and many of us were especially annoyed by the poor acoustics and chilly temperatures in the meeting rooms, which we were told were unadjustable. The conference meals were served by an untrained or poorly supervised serving staff, who failed to bring me one or more of the standard items (dessert, salad, beverage) at three different meals -- despite my requests after others at the table had been served but not everyone. All three times the serving staff disappeared when the after-meal programs began, so those who had been overlooked initially never got served.

The Ritz itself and the grounds are impeccable and clean. The extremely cordial and polite staff always greet you at the door, consistently offering to help with your bags, assist you out of a cab, or help you find your way around. We noticed when we paused to look around when we first entered, someone immediately came over, asked if they could be of any assistance. I was sold even before we checked in! At one point during our stay, we came back from an outside excursion and decided to sit for a minute on the main lobby couches, and a staff member came over asking if they could get us a drink or a menu. We could not believe how attentive they were! The rooms were clean, well kept, the d\u00c3\u00a9cor was neutral and calming, the bedding was down pillows and comforter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very comfortable sleep! The rooms are cleaned twice a day; once in the morning, and once in the early evening. In between housekeeping rounds, we would get a knock on our door asking if we would like additional towels or water. At one point, I had left my diamond earrings on the sink in the bathroom, forgetting to lock them in the safe. I was a little worried about the second rounds of housekeeping that day knowing we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be back until late, but when we got back to our room, everything was straightened up, including our bathroom and my earrings were placed on the glass shelf, above the sink \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could not believe the honesty of the staff member! The staff is unbelievably considerate when knocking on your door too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at one point, we could not find our TV remote, when we called downstairs to see if we left it on our food cart, they offered to send a new one immediately (at no additional cost). When the staff member arrived with our new remote, the main desk called the room and said we had our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Privacy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd note on the door (staff members will not knock if that sign is up) and let us know the staff member was outside the door. When you walk onto the beach, the staff greets and asks how many beach chairs you will be requiring, and they set them up for you with fresh towels and umbrellas. There is chair side wait service; a wait staff member will come to you at the beach chair and take a drink or food order. I did not know this when I first went to the bar to order some drinks, and the waiter seeing me place my order and pick up 3 drinks, rushed over with a tray and insisted on carrying them to our chairs. We ordered room service for breakfast and dinner; the presentation of the food itself is amazing! When you place your order by phone, they give you an approximate delivery window time frame and the food is always on time. For breakfast orders, you can fill out a menu the night before, hang it on your door before 1am with a time frame you wish to eat in the morning and the food is delivered as requested! We literally woke up and the food was delivered a few minutes later. Each time the staff brought the food in, they would personally lift each top off of the trays, stating the item underneath, always saying if we need anything to let them know and every \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on our end was always responded with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153my pleasure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

We played tennis and took tennis lessons - our pro Kamil was very thorough and our group clinic for 1.5 hours in the mid days sun was exhausting - and left us all sweating and smiling.. I had a deep tissue massage in the spa - simply wonderful. The spa is a bit small, with just a ladies and gents locker room and a shared whirlpool and finnish sauna. Not a lot of relaxation space. Exercise space was adequate with tredmill, elliptical, bike and universal. I did not take any of the classes - it appeared there were two per day. We sat at the pool, and sat at the beach, no problem having the pool staff find and set up loungers and umbrellas. We ordered drinks and light snacks from the pool waiters as well as ordered ourselves from the bar. The pool waiters were a little slow, and we had to hunt them down (after waiting quite a long time) to close our tab. The service in the bar from Robert and Elmer was exceptional. We frequented the club lounge for a light breakfast, mid day snack and pre-dinner drinks. The staff was incredibly accomodating, mixing any cocktail, including tasty mojitos. Wine, champagne, cappucino, tea, soda and water were available through out the day. Well worth the upgrade. We had a cooked to order breakfast each day in the cafe. Service was good, but the room is all tile and glass, and quite noisy. For some reason - there was always lots of breakage each day, dishes and glasses breaking and smashing on the tile floor. The casino was quite fun - much lower minimums at tables than I have seen at other upscale resorts. Saturday table minimum bet was $2. Not too crowded, the usual slot hogs in place. We had a memorable meal at Il Mulino. Expert waitstaff and an Outstanding captain (Steven). WE enjoyed the welcome treats as well as the strawberry grapa that concluded our evening. My only complaint was the incredible markup on the wine - 5x retail?? I think we were one of the only tables with a bottle. They'd sell more if the markup were more reasonable, and the list expanded more than just the \"well know\" wines. Time to add some QPR gems to the list. The location is close to the airport, but there is no overwhelming noise. A cab ride from the airport was about $15, which included some charge for luggage. It is a $21 cab ride into Old El San Juan. THe taxi's are almost all very large vans than can easily accomodate 6. One small complaint was the timing of the room cleaning. Service was provided twice a day - in the \"morning\" and then again around 5 PM. Everyday - our room was not serviced until 2 PM or LATER. So we would come back to the room - still dirty. No clean towels. I Don't understand why the rooms, particularly on the club level couln't be serviced by 12:30. But honestly, it was a small inconvenience for an outstanding visit.

It is across the street from the airport which had me worried about sound and perhaps view/ ambiance. Not to worry--our room faced the airport and the sound proofing was excellent. There were nice views of the mountains beyond. The room is comfortable--not large, but recently renovated and handsome.We had a room with a king size bed. There was a small-ish loveseat which we later realized was a fold out couch--great for families with one child. The dresser just inside the drawer wins the award for shallowest dresser in the world! The drawers are maybe 11\" deep. There is only one sink in the bathroom, there is a bathtub but not a separate shower. The water pressure was excellent. There is one small-ish closet. The TV is a flat screen but none of the channels are high definition (a big deal to my husband). (None of the TVs in the entire hotel are high def--not in bars, restaurants, casinos.) We stayed on the club level so had access to the four presentations/ day. We used it at breakfast and occasionally at lunch--on a nice day it was more relaxing to have lunch on the beach than trudge up to the club level. Some reviews comment on the high prices for food and drink--makes me wonder if these people have ever stayed in a hotel before. In my experience, the prices are what you would expect. We enjoyed BLT Steak and Il Mulino. The latter is pricey--but all Il Mulino's are pricey. The beach service was quick and friendly. The staff working the beach was very helpful and would set up a chair in the shade or the sun. There were shady palm trees and umbrellas for the sun averse. There was also plenty of sun for sun worshipers. The exercise facility had two rooms--one with cardio and weight lifting equipment. The second room was for yoga and spinning classes--also great for working out on your own with exercise balls, mats, weighted bars, steps, etc. The cardio room needs more ellipticals--there are only four and there was always a line in the morning. There were five treadmills and one recumbent bike. I had a massage--really nice. It was an easy and relaxing trip. We were fortunate to have lovely weather which was a plus.

As a platinum Marriott member I rarely have had an experience where I felt the staff simply didn't care, but this Ritz seemed to be populated by clueless staff with less than cheerful attitudes. Additionally, the setting was somewhat odd as it is about 1 mile from the airport as the crow flies and in a sketchy area. The shame of it all is that with good management and a dedicated staff, this hotel could easily get up to standards and meet, if not surpass, other Ritz properties. It has a casino, which many people might like. The spa has great potential as well and the physical plant was built to good standards. Ocean is within 300 feet of the rooms if you get a coveted ocean view, but many of these views also encompass a view of the rooftop of a part of the facility and if you have lower than 3rd floor you won't see ocean. Our room had hair in the bathtub from a poorly draining bath and when we moved to the next room we had two wet rags over the shower bar from the last maid service. The spa was tired and unappealing with no whirlpool and a bizarre steam room with a sink in it, but the masseuses were fantastic. The pool was unheated, which made it challenging to consider during the winter. On the positive side, the workout rooms were top-notch. There were some surprising restaurants around, including a BLT Steak, which we didn't get to eat at and a slew of other choices within walking distance (Chilis, Wendys, Baskin Robbins, McDonalds). The hotel shops were outstanding, including a Tiffany's and other boutiques. Good things about it included the beds, which were fantastic and the appointments in the rooms, which were recently redone.

We took a chance with the tail end of hurricane season, and we are glad we did...the weather was PERFECT. The hotel is at the very end of the strip of hotels, which actually is a very good thing---the strip leaves a little to be desired. There are some homeless and shady types roaming around the area at times, at night, but overall we didn't have any bad experiences. There are police up and down the strip constantly. The hotel is beautiful, and the staff were very welcoming and accommodating as soon as we arrived. Everything was in order regarding our reservations, and we were offered an upgrade to an ocean view room, for a small fee; the hotel was not at capacity because it was still not peak season yet. This turned out to be a great thing, because there were no crowds, and there were tons of free poolside lounges & chairs, and there was always a chair and umbrella available on the beach. There are guys working for the hotel who will set you up with a couple of chairs, a table, and an umbrella for no extra fee (just a tip). This was great, considering many upscale hotels will charge you extra for reserving a chair. We assumed it was this way because it was off season. As far as the poolside and beach drink and food service, this was one of the negatives. The service was quite slow. Although the drinks were expensive (really expensive), we would have bought more if the servers came around more frequently (hotel management take note; you could have made a lot more $$ on drinks!). The hotel has some restaurants within, which we took advantage of only once because we like to get out and explore. The restaurants on site are very expensive, as well, but the food was good. We had a breakfast package included in our booking, so we had daily breakfast at their buffet, and this was very nice- fresh fruits, juices, omelette station, cheeses, pastries, etc. As far as the room, we felt it was fine. It wasn't quite as \"wow\" as I would have expected from a Ritz-Carlton; we had never stayed at a Ritz-Carlton before, so maybe our expectations were too high, but it was a nice room; the bathroon was particularly nice, though the door didn't close properly. One negative was that we had this huge picture window that offered a beautiful ocean view- except the window was quite dirty, which made the view not so hot. This was unfortunate, given it took away from what would have been a beautiful view. The A/C unit in the room also would make a loud \"bang\" every time it would kick off.

The grounds are lush and tropical, the pool area is gorgeous and the beach is great as well. From the moment you arrive, the staff treats you like family and this is the hotels greatest advantage. Their service is phenomenal and they are all one of a kind. I promise that you will be happy you chose this hotel for the staff alone. The casino is moderatly sized and provides entertainment, the restaurants are amazing. You have to try the chicken parm at Il Mulino and the cocunut grouper sliders at Mares. The bar by the beach has the most amazing frozen mojitos and champagne cocktails. See Michael and he will make you a pretty pink drink with champgne and the local passoua liquor. He was so helpful and kind while we picked his brain about local things to do. The rooms are very clean and very modern, we loved the beds as well. They were very comfortable! The bathrooms were spacious, with a seperate water closet and a shower/tub combo. Housekeeping kept our room clean and neat the entire trip. It was worth the money to upgrade to a pool/ocean view room. We were on the 8th floor and our view was amazing. 24 hour room service as well. We had one issue with our A/C on the 3rd day of our trip and within 5 minutes there was a repair tech who fixed the problem and we were so impressed. The spa was wonderful also, I had a facial and enjoyed the products they used so much that I had to bring them home with me. The facilities (shower, sauna, lockers etc) were clean and nice as well. We were able to use these after a long day at the pool as we hurried to catch our flight. The location of the hotel is great, $20 taxi to Old San Juan, $15 to Condado and $15 to the airport. Very safe as well. We walked to Platos and Metropol for lunch/dinner and it was lovely to be out and about. There was some evenign entertainment in the lobby lounge but it ended pretty early. Seems to be an older crowd at this hotel, but this makes for a quiet and relaxing getaway. We did not want to leave. I have to mention, Gabriel Albaladejo (the Guest relatons coordinator), he was amazing! Always a smiling face, alaways remembered our names, taught me to salsa dance in the lobby and reccomended amazing places to visit in Old San Juan and Condado. Carlos, the bellman, was also such a pleasure. He told us to get yucca mofongo at Cafe Puerto Rico and we loved it! He was so kind and accomodating each day as he helped us get taxis and decide where to go.

Overall, the hotel was nice, a very solid Ritz-Carlton, no unlike those in the Carribbean or Mexico. The room was pleasant, properly well maintained, the casino was not too rowdy, the pool was excellent and beach front location was also great. The fitness center, as well as the tennis court, were also fantastic, exceeded my expectation for a small hotel. No complaints here at all (and I'm generally someone who's quite particular and picky). My issue though (recurring throughout my stay) was the service. It's not what one would expect from a Ritz-Carlton. I think it's more comparable to a Westin or a Marriott - something that is meant to be a large-hotel style service and is generally 1 to 1.5 notches below a Ritz-Carlton. Not sure if it's just different culture and expectation / definition of \"service\", but just reduce your expectation. At the pool, it was impossible to flag down anyone to serve us drinks.

(We've used this AMEX program previously and have been VERY happy with the hotels included--truly great hotel venues). I'm sorry to report that THIS Ritz, in many ways, does NOT live up to the Ritz-Carlton reputation. The first issue was upon arrival: after checking in, our luggage wasn't delivered to the room for 30 minutes. Upon trying to call the Front Desk to inquire, NO ONE answered the phone upon 3 successive calls. I eventually had to go down to the lobby only to find my luggage STILL sitting on a baggage cart directly in front of the check-in desk. I had to ask that it be delivered immediately. The accommodations: the rooms are average sized: NOT the spacious, welcoming, and comfortable rooms associated with the Ritz. The junior suite level of accommodation is certainly NOT a suite and failed to meet any pre-conception of the accommodation level.The prices of the rooms are based solely on the views......and they are certainly NOT spectacular. My \"junior suite - city view\" was a small room with the view of a local apartment complex immediately next door. Now, understand that I'd called the hotel DIRECTLY to inquire about the accommodation and was given a description that in no way was equal to the level provided. While I was supposed to be upgraded to the next level of service because of my affiliation with AMEX, the next level wasn't available for all three days--but the level of service above that one was....but , no upgrade. I subsequently learned that there were executive suites and full suites available--but the registration staff didn't offer or alert me of the options. The cleanliness of the room was average: a decent sized stain was present on the carpeting as one entered the room: plain as day. Obviously, the housekeeping staff didn't give a hoot about it let alone correcting it. Dining: The breakfast was just as another reviewer of this hotel stated: limited options and certainly not the variety you'd, again, expect from the Ritz. Lots of rolls/bread/cereals----not much else. While that would be fine if the breakfast was a continental one: but, it's spun as a \"full breakfast\" buffet. The restaurant \"BLT\" has good food: but, like a fellow reviewer, it was VERY expensive and the taste, quality and portions were average. I too felt cheated. I ordered a fruit plate from room service after inquiring about the types of fruit included: of course, the plate that arrived was nothing as described. The staff: many of the staff (particularly in the restaurants) seemed pre-occupied and seem to be \"put upon\" by having to deal with us. This seemed anathema to me given that we were guests at a Ritz-Carlton!! The SPA: to our surprise, the staffer that greeted us, after inquiring as to whether we'd been to other R-C spas (to which we replied in the affirmative), offered spontaneously that this one was not quite up to the standard(s) of the others we'd visited. Unbelievable !!! This hotel was Okay: but definitely NOT in the tradition of service synonymous of the Ritz-Carlton and definitely NOT a \"five-star\" property.

The televisions in the exercise equipment in the health club did not work and those that did got poor reception. 5. Depending on where you sat at the pool side restaurant you would get hit with an overwhelming smell of dirty dishes/garbage from the kitchen that was nauseating. 6.

The good: -Clean, newly renovated floors 7-10. They are working their way down, so if you go, request to be on the higher floors. - Houskeeping, lobby, pool/beach, and dinner service was excellent. All friendly and helpful. The Average: -The pool water looked like ocean water. Didnt have that crystal clear sparkle. -The breakfast buffet was rediculously overpiced at $55 a plate for eggs, bacon, sausage, mango juice and an omlett chef. If this is not included in your package, Denny's is a 2 in walk away. Also the service in this restraunt was lacking. I went through a whole sitting without being greeted or served, had to ask for coffee, and the bill was never presented as if I didnt exist, so I left. -There are descent water activities right off the beach. Surf/SUP boards for rental, a little rock reef to snorkle, nothin fancy. Around the corner we rented a Hobiecat sailboat for $60 and had a ton of fun. Jetski's are available as well. The Bad: - Hot water. In my 5 night stay, I had an engineer in the room 4 days to check for hot water. by the end of my stay, I just called guest services to turn on the boilers so that I could take a luke warm shower every time. They insisted that there wasnt a widespread problem, however without fail, the shower was cold within a min or two. - To add to the hot water issue, the 'hot' tub was a mildly warm tub at best most likely carrying the heat of the sun into the evening. There was nothing Hot about it. No steam, no bubbles, just bath water. -Drink prices. $14 for a pina colada. $9 for a corona, $12 for a captain/coke all served in a tiny plastic dickie cup at the beach. If buying for 2, to achieve a slight buzz will cost you dearly. On the otherhand, they do not prohibit coolers or externally bought alcohol, wink wink. -Airport noise. I didnt think I would notice it, but when a Jet leaves, you can almost feel the rumble. From our window, you could see airplanes taxi. On the beach you could hear the jets being turned on etc. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning. Recommended activities: Ingrid and captain Dan on the Erin Go Brah sailboat was amazing. (www.egbc.net) $100/each and you get to enjoy a full day of sailing with multiple snorkle stops an excellent grilled rib/chicken, rice, salad lunch, and they provide an open bar for the day. Dollar for Dollar this is the best day trip I could have booked. Highly recommended. (Rented a car and drove 1 hr to the marina) La Perla Restraunt in the El Concha hotel. $17 cab ride from the ritz towards old sj. We exhausted the dining around the Ritz and headed to La Perla at the ritz doormans reccommendation (Carlos). it was awesome. Right on the beach in a unique shell type structure, waves crashing, great menu (displayed on an ipad). Very nice upscale restraunt. El Morro fort in Old San Juan. Its a $20 cab ride to and from, but totaly worth it. Take a morning and go check it out.

Despite it being a work trip, when I was back in the hotel each night I slipped immediately into a \"vacation mode\" and had an amazing time. Different experiences await all around -- a couple of nights, you could go from a garden outside watching a big iguana eating flowers, to the hotel lobby area with has a beautifully spaced bar and lounge area -- on several nights there was live entertainment, and couples would be doing a salsa or other dancing and it was 100% alive and happy. Both I and others in my party remarked that when at that bar we felt more like we were at someone's home for a party, rather than a public venue. This is very rare for a hotel to accomplish. It also had the very pleasant effect that many strangers freely introduced themselves and engaged -- people from all over the world visiting for work or tourism, and many people living in Puerto Rico. A very interesting group of people every time we stopped for drink or quick bite of food at the bar. The pool is incredibly beautiful and there is excellent food available outside with water all around -- the ocean is simply on the other side of the beautiful palm trees and plants -- a matter of a few feet. A perfect setting. The room was very good, but I stayed in it so little as it was so comfortable to relax outside the room in many different hotel spaces and settings. And there is a great little casino which had new machines, table games and a well spaced format. And several other high-end hotels and casinos a very short walking distance. I cannot compliment the hotel service and staff enough. In 12 days I had over 50 interactions with staff regarding some item of need or information.

I thought it was very well-kept, the pool was beautiful and the layout perfect to not feel crowded by everyone. It did get busy, of course, but I was happily surprised to see it stay open 24 hours, perfect for a late night quiet dip. Service, front desk, check-in and even the on-site doctor (for a minor hiking injury) were all attentive, efficient and friendly. The rehearsal dinner and wedding night dinner were superb - but probably moreso because they were free for us. Being a member of the wedding party, our hotel was free for two nights and discounted the others - a huge cost savings. Otherwise, as expected at a Ritz, hotel and restaurant and especially drink prices were off the charts.

Not only did I have to switch rooms 3 times due to mold, but I also had billing issues. This is unacceptable for any hotel. The Ritz does not live up to its reputation. First, I have to say that I am not a \"high maintenance\" woman. The frills are nice, but comfort, cleanliness, service, and safety come #1 for me. I have stayed in hotels ranging from $15/night to $400/night depending on my purpuse for the trip. This time, I was attending a conference at the Ritz. I arrived a couple of days before the conference started. My room had odor from day #1 that just worsened with time. It was constantly humid. By the 3rd night (the first night of the conference) my room had a horrible (and increasingly nauseous) moldy smell. I asked the other attendees about their rooms. I entered another attendee's room across the hall that had *no* odor and was not humid. I complained on a Thursday night, the gentleman took my cell phone number, and he told me that I would be contacted the next day once the manager arrived around 730/8AM. Nobody contacted me, so the next day during a break I checked again, and nothing had been done. I went to the front desk again at lunch, and I was told that they could do a \"blind move\". If I packed my bags, they would move them to another room for me. I packed, and the front desk immediately called. I took my bags downstairs, got a new key, dragged my bags up to the 8th floor, and walked right into (you guessed it) another stinky room. The odor was overwhelming. I called the front desk from the room 2 times, and nobody answered. I packed my bags again, and went back downstairs. When I asserted that the stench was just as bad, I was told that the hotel was booked, so \"Why don't you just put your bags in the room for now.\" Excuse me? I told them that under no circumstances would I return to that room, not only because I'd been up and down the floors several times with my bags, but also because there was no way I'd stay in another stinky and possibly dangerously moldy room. (By now I had spoken to 4 different employees about the problem.) The front desk stored my bags for me and told me they'd call when another room was ready. No calls. After the conference let out for the day, I went to the front desk and asked again. I was told that a room was available, and I was given a key. The lady took my bag ticket and said that they would send my bags up. I went to the room and there was significantly less stench when I opened the door to room 441. The air was noteably fresher and less humid. Then I waited for 45 minutes for my bags!! I went back to the front desk and said that **I** would take my bags. Yes, you know it-- She asked me for my ticket!! I told her that SHE had taken it, I claimed my bags, and once again **I** carried all of my bags to the new room. I have to add that during the room-moving process I had several people tell me, \"But this is the Caribbean. Things are damp here.\" I replied that I am well aware of that, which is why I tolerated the dampness of the room at first. It worsened with time, and once I found out that other rooms were fresher I had no reason to subject myself to mold. I stayed at this same hotel 2 years ago with no mold issues. I have LIVED in the Caribbean and in Central America. However, I stayed in a different hotel for an annual trip to PR in March 2011, and my room there had no moldy odor. (Needless to say, I will be returning to that hotel in March of 2012, not the Ritz!) The minor, but nevertheless annoying billing issues... During the process of this, I noted that the first room had 2 Snickers bars when I left. I had stored my own food in the mini-bar since gluten makes me very ill, and I have learned over the years that P.Rico is not a gluten-free-friendly island. The front desk should have been very aware that I was storing food in the mini-bar, because during the process of switching rooms they had to store a large bag of my food in their refrigerator. After I left the first room I told the front desk that the room had 2 candy bars. I assumed that they \"replaced\" a candy bar because the first candy bar was hidden behind my food. (There were several other food items I'd removed from the mini-bar to make room for my food. I'd eaten nothing; it would make me literally ill.) I was told that they would make sure that I wasn't billed. Of course, in keeping with the empty promises, I found the charge on my bill as I left at the end of my stay. I talked to someone downstairs as I checked out, and I was told again (more empty promises) that they would make sure that I wasn't billed. Today I received my final copy of the bill via email and- BINGO!- a charge for that candy bar that was NEVER EATEN appeared on my bill. Other conference attendees at the Ritz found that after a day or two their rooms also began to stink of mold. Another colleague requested a featherless room in advance and had issues with the hotel. There were other less significant issues like inconsistent water pressure/temperature in the first room, a *maid walking straight into the room WITHOUT KNOCKING... but the mold and billing were the 2 biggies for me. I spent so much time dealing with ridiculous issues at the Ritz. No guest at ANY hotel should have to spend so much time during a business trip or a vacation dealing with stinky (and likely unhealthy) rooms or being billing for services or products you don't use. I would give the service for the front desk 2/5. They were very polite, but didn't follow through on their promises. And I spoke with probably 8-10 different people at the front desk over the course of my stay... I would give the pool staff 5/5. I give this hotel 1 star because the staff members at the POOL were polite, they DID follow through, and they were very helpful. Kudos to them for saving my filtered water bottle when I left it at the pool one day, and for bringing ice for my swollen leg. Room staff were also polite but.... (See *) An additional star for the property. Even if the next conference is held at this hotel, this Ritz is permanently crossed off of my list of possible hotels for future business trips.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201c\"Great Stay!

New paint, repairs. etc. Thats really it on the cons and belive me all the bad reviews are totally false. PROS: Excellent service 5 stars. Very close to city and many restaraunts within walking distance. (Metropol) across street.WOW!!! very safe area. 2 blocks down is Best Tour Connection for any kind of rental you need at great prices. Tell Sheila the guys from the Ritz sent you.\"inside joke\". Anyways rent a scooter and head to Pinones for an amazing experience only 10 minutes from hotel Rooms fine with very cold A.C. and beds were great! I must agree that rooms are a tad musky but after you turn on the air it goes away. I read just about every review in here and cant belive the negativity. I think people do this to keep it a hidden treasure. fine with me. Make sure to go over to The old San Juan Hotel to check out the lobby on the weekend. Everyone is dancing even the elderly with walking sticks. Cant wait to go back and Thank You Ritz for your service and to Sheila at the scooter rental place for your friendliness and passion for your beautiful country. Please do not believe other reviews.

It was our first Adults-Only vacation since our daughter was born 18 months ago. The resort came highly recommended, and we have stayed at many Ritz Carlton's around the world, so we had an idea as to what was in store. Let me first start out by saying that we had an amazing time. It was so great to be at a hotel, away from the madness of our every day lives, BUT it wasn't exactly the escape we were hoping it would be. OVERALL Pros: - Very close to the airport. You do hear planes (only at the pool/beach) but it was like 4-5 times a day. Not disruptive at all. - Service was amazing. As at all Ritz Carlton's the service is top notch. Everyone remembers your name, your drink orders...and waits on you hand and foot. They will set up chairs by the pool and on the beach for you too, which is a nice touch. - Food was delicious. We ate at BLT Steak one night, and ordered room service another night (ate at Pikayo at another hotel one night - highly recommend it). Every morning we ate at the breakfast buffet - great variety Cons (and these aren't terrible things!): - It is an older Ritz. There were some spots on the wall paper in our room (didn't bother me at all). Some tiles were missing in the pool. The rafts they offer in the pool are pretty old and worn. - The TVs in the room are older - The rooms are a little small, but nothing like a city hotel room usually is! You don't spend much time in the room anyhoo - Everything is VERY expensive. From $18 hamburgers, to $14 glasses of wine...the food and drink was expensive, but we knew that going in. Since the hotel isn't near anything else, you have to pay the prices at the hotel for food if you aren't willing to take a cab somewhere. POOL AREA (we spent the majority fo our time here so I wanted to review separately): - We decided to do it up and rent a cabana by the pool for two of the days. It cost $250 for the cabana, included in that are 4 bottles of Fuji water, chips and salsa, and a dedicated waiter (who was there as soon as you needed him). If you have the option to do this, and the price isn't a big deal, DO IT. It is worth every penny. While they aren't exactly private, they are away from the crowds, and you have your own nice big double chaises, and tables and then two chaises outside the tented area. - If you want a seat at the pool, you need to get there early. We are very early risers, so we were saving seats at the pool by 7 AM (on the days we didn't get a cabana), and then going to eat breakfast. I highly recommend getting there early as it fills up quickly! And it is nice to get seats away from the big sections. The pool is the most enjoyable from 7-10 AM, and then it is chaos. - There are many families that stay at this hotel (who brings their kids to the Ritz??). Be prepared to have kids screaming and jumping and splashing. I didn't realize it was so family friendly when we booked it, as we were looking for a getaway from our kid, and couldn't stop thinking about her with all the kids running around. - If you do go with kids, they offer you a pack n play to use by the pool, which is awesome My Major Gripes: - They need to do a better job of policing the entrance to the pool from the beach. On the weekend there are a lot of local kids and families that come in to use the pool, which is not allowed. It says that you need to show a room key, but they weren't asking for them, so random people were coming in to use the pool. This was driving me crazy. There was a group of teenagers (obviously local kids) who tried to sit in the cabana next to us, and were splashing around and talking so loudly in the pool in front of us. Finally security got them out, but then they were smoking by the pool (it is a non-smoking resort) - I was not happy. - The cabanas need to be more private. The people next to us one day got a iPod dock and were blasting their Jersey Shore club music and I wanted to throw something at them. It had been such a lovely quiet day until they started playing their music so that everyone could hear. Not cool. Or just don't offer iPod docks!! Overall it was a great experience, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are trying to do a romantic weekend away.

I have been to Puerto Rico many times but this was my boyfriends first visit to island. Room: We arrived around 2:00 pm or so and our room wasn't quit ready and they asked us to come back. They held our bags and told us that they would have them in our room when we came back. After eating a late lunch at the Metropol Restaurant, which is across they street (awesome place), we came back and went to our room. Now they did put our luggage in another room but it was no problem bringing them down to the room. The poolside room was great. Now there are rooms at this hotel that have balconies but that wasn't a big deal to us but something to consider if you like the fresh air and hearing the ocean. The bed in room was very comfortable. There was a radio/alarm with an iPod dock in the room which I really enjoyed. I also really enjoyed the shower! It had a ton of water pressure with the massage type shower heads with several settings. Very nice. I also really liked the fact that they had a really nice iron. Sometimes in hotels they have very cheap irons that ruin your clothes. Overall, I would give the poolside view room on the 5th floor two thumbs up. Food & Drink: We did have the breakfast package included in our stay at the Ritz. The breakfast buffet was great for a standard buffet. There was an omelet station, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, a variety of breads/bagels, cereal, fruit and orange and guava juice. Now if you don't have the breakfast package included, this buffet is $27 and totally overpriced. You would be better off eating breakfast down the street at Mi Casita's... We did get a chance to eat the grill by the pool/beach. It was your standard burger and fries. The drinks at this hotel are ridiculously priced. Two bloody mary's are $34 and change... You would be better off going to Walgreen's next door and buying bloody mary mix and vodka and making them yourself and taking them to the beach! We spent a small fortune on the alcoholic beverages! Tip: Metropol is an authentic Puerto Rican restuarant. Awesome food. We also ate at Mi Casita's and this by far was the best meal I had during my entire stay! The chicken mufongo was unbelievable! Plato's was another great restaurant in walking distance that was fabulous. My boyfriend had the whole snapper and he really enjoyed it! In old San Juan, I would recommend a restaurant called Mojitos... it is authentic and so flavorful! Facilities: The pool was a tad bit small but I really enjoy the ocean so we spent most of our time there! There are beach chairs and towels at both places so you can enjoy either or. I will say that the ocean in this area (Ritz) doesn't seem as nice as by the ESJ Towers just west of the Ritz.. . There is an awesome tennis court at this hotel so bring your racket if you like to play. The workout room had a ton of stationary bikes but no treadmills or other cardio machines.... I guess be prepared to just jog on the beach to get your cardio workout in! We discover the hot tub the last day we were there! Take a dip in the evenings... it will warm you up and the jets will give you a nice massage. We went into the casino one night and I play at the craps table and won close to $400... so that was awesome, especially if you enjoy craps. There is only one table and the minimum bets that I saw was anywhere between $2 - $5 so it was quite affordable to play and have some fun. Service: Overall, I thought the service was fine. It is Puerto Rico though and the islands. The staff was very friendly and accommodating but sometimes it was hard to find the staff and the service is sometimes slow... but again, people from the island run on a different pace so be patient and tolerant! The only thing I found to be annoying is that the maid service knocked on the door a ton when we were in our room (checking on the minibar, asking if we need anything, etc). Put up your privacy tag if you don't want to be bothered. We just forgot to do this sometimes. Entertainment: We took the Castillo snorkeling tour. It was fantastic. It's an all day excursion to Fajardo and you take a catamaran to an island and hang out on the beach and snorkel. They also dock the boat just off shore to do some additional swimming/snorkel in deeper coral reefs. It was an awesome time. I highly recommend this tour! We also took a quick cab ride to Old San Juan. We had an awesome dinner at a salsa dinner/club called Latin Root. Then we went on the boat ride around the pier... it was the \"party boat\" where you could enjoy the scenery, dance and drink! It was great times. I also would recommend this as well! Overall, we were happy with out stay at the Ritz Carlton. It isn't the same as the Ritz in like a New York City or Chicago so people should not have those type of expectations. I have stayed in many hotels on Isla Verde and it is one of the nicest hotels there. I would go back again and I definitely would recommend it to friends and family.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThird week in February is wrong week.\u201d", "Author": "texasyaya", "ReviewID": "UR113274521", "Content": "Hotel was dingy and dirty.

We usually stay at Four Seasons, Fairmonts, or Grand Hyatts. From the reviews I've read, I guess I shouldn't judge the chain by this hotel. It wasn't terrible or anything, but most definitely was disappointing. I wonder how much I should blame on the weather, which was NONSTOP RAIN almost the entire time I was there, and how much I should blame on the surrounding neighborhood. It was depressing, like a run-down strip-mall clad street near Hollywood Boulevard. Unlike the other reviewers, I wasn't put off by the airport; I didn't hear the planes at all. But the room did smell a bit \"funny\"...kind of like this cloying, nasty smell that wouldn't stop. The casino was a bit depressing, but then again, I'm not a gambler. Whirring and buzzing and neon lights 24/7...not relaxing and not for me. The beach was kind of dirty...not the kind of sand I'm used to seeing in the Caribbean; this was greyish/brownish, not even golden. Some employees were super friendly and great, particularly at the poolside bar, the casino, the lobby bar, and the restaurant for breakfast. Great steak at BLT as well. Others seemed irritated to deal with you. The tour desk was pretty much worthless. They didn't set up a thing for you, merely giving you numbers, unless it was one of \"their\" tours. When I asked to be set up on one of their tours, they never made the reservation and then when I asked to be put on the next day's tour (bioluminescent bay) they said there would be no tour. Also, the horseback ride they set us up on ended up being two hours earlier than they told us, so we had to cancel since we were asleep in our bed when they had the concierge call! They DID NOT believe us when we said we received the wrong information. The worst situation with the tour desk has to be the diving situation. They referred us to a dive boat which promised me a deep dive from Humacao (which is farther from the hotel than Fajardo, where they take the beginner divers). Imagine our surprise the next day when, after driving all the way to Humacao marina from the resort, I realized once we got on the boat that we were heading BACKWARDS towards Fajardo (where the weather was WORSE, it was sunny in Humacao). The divemaster avoided telling us where we were and how deep the dive was (the promotional material for the dive company emphasizes that Humacao is a deeper dive with better visibility). After a long boat ride and then an awful dive with fifteen feet visibility at twenty feet most of the time, I realized that they'd taken us back to Fajardo! I was right. So basically, we were lied to about the dive, driven a half an hour out of our way only to take a longer boat ride, then driven back out of our way. Also, the Humacao trip would have had us back to the harbor at around noon and (because we went to Fajardo to \"dive\", then all the way back to Humacao marina for a long trip back to the hotel) we didn't get back until after three pm and we had to miss our next activity. Of course, the trip desk couldn't do anything about this, as it wasn't one of \"their\" tours. The surf company they recommended was absolutely disrespectful in every way. I waited over a half an hour for the instructor, only to have a girl who didn't speak English come back and say they were going to be late. When I asked \"how late\", she didn't understand what I was saying. Turns out, she was learning to be an instructor and would be sitting in on my lesson. This meant they spoke Spanish to each other the whole time, ignoring me completely. Now, I know a bit of Spanish, although it is mostly derived from a few friends here in CA who are Mexican-American, and from what I understand, the Puerto Rican dialect is different. But I could still at least understand that they were saying some rather snotty things about tourists, and when I called them on it, they insisted that it wasn't true and said that they were talking about some party they had been to (Turistos and Gringos, sorry, but that's not about any kind of party). They were incredibly unprofessional; when the girl who was taking the lesson with me fell and hurt herself, they laughed. Again, this isn't the resort's fault, but the tour desk/concierge people merely shrugged and said \"not my problem.\" Finally, the room, while nice, had NO lanai or porch and NO windows that opened. Coupled with the clouds, it created a depressing and airless atmosphere. The pool was very nice. It was a great temperature, and I liked the lion fountains. Too bad it was pouring rain most of the time! It was a pretty disappointing trip and while I was underwhelmed by the Ritz Carlton San Juan, I was also disappointed by other factors. Still, if you're looking for a five star hotel, this is not it. More like four, maybe? I also visited the neighboring hotels for comparisons and I found the El San Juan to look like a dark, funereal, 1980s era New Jersey mall and the Intercontinental to be charmless. So if you are staying near the airport, I would gather the Ritz would be your best bet. As for me, I am not heading back to Puerto Rico any time soon. From what I understand, the best diving is in the South and West, and yet there are no luxury hotels there, and I did not like the San Juan environs at all. It did not feel like a tropical getaway in the least.

I called the Hotel and spoke with Carmen,she heard my concerns ...I was reading the reviews at Trip Advisor... And addressed each one with much care, I wanted this trip to be perfect,my husband and I have been working so much,we most certainly needed this vacation. Now here writing this review I have to wonder where those people went . From our arrival to the last minute we were there we had nothing but an amazing experience. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Daniella she checked us in and made sure we had a great room. Also during our stay she helped us with info on places to go,what an amazing smile she had. Next morning we got up and went to the pool to secure some chairs...the trip advisor said it was not enough chairs and the service at the pool and beach were awful ...we were wowed when we were asking for towels and Pablo went and set up our chairs tucking our towels in the chairs and \u00c2\u00a0making sure we had everything we needed.

Food was fantastic) HOTEL/ROOMS: Its a RITZ, in the traditional sense of it. I had a Club room (club lounge asscess I think is key) that was an upgraded size, 600+ Sq. Ft. Very nice, but very traditional Furnishings. Could be updated in the near future. Comfortable beds, and separate tub.shower (which most rooms do not have) We also had 2 windows that allowed a ton of natural light in. Most rooms only have 1.

The Pool and Mare I feel could use menu variety. Too many fried foods and no fresh seafood options. We ate Breakfast at Mare, which was very nice & included (great omelet station, with the friendliest staff) But for lunch we would opt to go to the club lounge for a simple salad and sandwich instead of eating the Pool/Beach fare. STAFF: This is what really makes this property great. Everyone is so nice and wants to help you have a fantastic vacation. Service is so important to me! So even tough the food is not the best in the world, and the hotel could use a bit of an update, the staff makes up for it in so many ways. And the convenience of its location.

I had heard mixed reviews of the hotel so really was curious to grade it myself. As a frequent traveler to nice destinations, I was pleasantly surprised with this property after a friend had told me it was \"awful\" and to change to the newly opened St. Regis. The hotel is a five minute cab ride from the airport which is extremely convenient. Aside from the sound of planes when the wind dies down, you are secluded in a beach paradise and don't feel near the airport. The hotel is smaller than most of the Ritz properties I've been to and not all of the rooms had balconies. The night of our arrival I told the manager we were disappointed with the shower pressure and that it was unfortunate the windows were dirty. He comped us very generously and had the water pressure adjusted and a new shower head installed the next morning. The employees were ALL very friendly and professional though the service around the pool and beach was sub-par - we found ourselves going up to the bar and ordering drinks ourselves - meet Elmer who works at the pool bar - he's great! The beach is a pretty crescent and the surf is calm/moderate. The sand is soft but I've noticed in Puerto Rico it's not white like on many other Caribbean islands.The food at the hotel was excellent though overpriced like every other luxury hotel. The pool was smaller than it appears in pictures and I missed an adult-only pool but it was kept refreshingly cool which I appreciated. Thankfully the resort wasn't very full so it wasn't overtaken by kids but easily could have been had we gone at a different time.

We traveled with a group of about 24 other people. My husband was there for business, I was there for pleasure. We arrived about 2 p.m. on Wednesday. Check in was quick and uneventful. Our bellman promptly showed us to our room with our luggage. The first thing I noticed were the stains on the carpet as well as the curtains. Pretty gross! We had paid for an oceanfront balcony and what we received was a view of a palm tree with limited view of the ocean. We chose to stay in this room, until the next morning. We went to breakfast (not sure the name of the restaurant where the buffet is served), it was included in our rate. The buffet is $27, and is about the equivalant to a breakfast at the Hampton Inn. The saving grace for breakfast was the chef Jeremy at the omelette station. Every morning he had a smile on his face, and was very friendly. The rest of the staff, however, was horrible. My husband asked for coffee and water. After about 15 minutes of waiting, and asking two servers for the same, we finally received our coffee. I was poured about a 1/4 of a cup, and the waitress was disgusted when I asked for a full cup. We had breakfast here each morning. Service incredibly slow! After the horrible service, my husband decided to change rooms, and get the oceanfront we were paying for. Apparently, the only room left in the whole hotel the guests chose a late check out. ONE room left?! At any rate, we called every hour, and the room still wasn't ready. Finally, 5 hours later we were taken to our new room. Again, stains on the carpet, but new tv, and beautiful view. We were on the corner with a view of the pool and the ocean. The view made the musty smell tolerable. The weather was horrible the whole time we were there. I did lay out in the clouds and rain. The staff at the pool was incredible. Every time the rain came, Elliot would run over and put our umbrella up and make sure we had dry towels. When the rain passed, he would come back over and put the umbrella down. The guys at the towel station were very attentive and friendly. The would move chairs wherever you wanted them, and if you couldn't find a chair they would find one for you. The food/beverage service at the pool was infrequent. The Ocean Bar was great! We went there a couple of evenings and had a really good time. The bar staff was very amusing and quick! I will say that the drinks were far too expensive for what you received. One of our fellow travelers asked for a glass of house Cabernet, he received it in a plastic wine glass with a price tag of $22. Maybe I am crazy, but that was outrageous! Robert was very entertaining, and he loves to play Angry Birds on anyone's electronic device sitting at the bar. Andrew from Indiana was awesome! It was pouring rain, and he ran to the hotel to find the nearest door that was unlocked for us (8 people) to get in. Robert called the front desk and several umbrellas were run out to us. We did not eat dinner at any of the restaurants in the hotel. We did, however, order room service. We ordered 2 Kobe beef hamburgers. They tasted like just an everyday burger, but were cooked exactly as we asked, which has never happened before. Upon reviewing the bill, we realized we were not served Kobe beef, nor were we charged for it. The room service was quite speedy. We did have lunch at the main restaurant (again, I don't remember the name), and the service was horrible. There were approximately 6 other guests in the restaurant, and it took 45 minutes to get 2 meals, forget about getting a refill on your beverage. The service again horrible!!! The conceriege was also very helpful and friendly. They recommended a couple of great restaurants, made reservations, and made sure that the person waiting on our party was the best. The lobby bar menu/cocktails were great, that is IF you can get service. Also, a man passed out on a couch that was never asked to leave. Really?! They just placed his bill on the table in front of him and went about their business. That is my experience...Oh, one last thing...Bar service at the BLT bar non-existent!

I have stayed at many Ritz-Carltons, and a multitude of 5 Star/Diamond properties, unfortunately the Ritz-Carlton in San Juan is just not up to Ritz-Carlton standards. If you are use to staying in nice hotels, you will be disappointed! If you are use to staying in 3 star hotels, you will be fine, but you will grossly overpay for everything! My disappointment started at check-in. At the time of check-in, the front desk clerk told me that I was in a city view room. My secretary had made the reservation, but she always reserves Ocean View rooms for me. Thinking that perhaps she had made an error, I requested an upgrade. I am at the top level of the Ritz's reward program that includes a free upgrade when available. Without missing a beat the front desk clerk informed me that the hotel was sold out. Then to my amazement, less than two minutes later, without speaking to anyone, she tells me that her supervisor had informed her that a nicer room was indeed avaialable. Then the truely amazing thing happened, she actually tried to upsell the nicer room for an additional $100.00! At that point, I dug through my briefcase and retrieved my reservation, sure enough, I had already paid for an oceanview room. When I showed the reservation to the clerk, she asked if she could show it to her supervisor. She then came back and gave us the room for which I had actually paid. No apology, nothing, just an attempted SCAM! The room was very below average, small, and without even a tiny balcony or even a window that opened. We could see the ocean, but the part of the hotel we stayed in was set back a long way from the ocean. If you are going to stay in this hotel, either make sure that you get a room with a balcony, or don't bother spending the money for an ocean view! After waiting over 15 minutes for our luggage, I finally called down to the bell desk to find our luggage. After another 15 minutes our luggage finally arrived. They told me when they wrestled the luggage out of my hands, that it would be brought immediately to our room. We had spent all day on planes, it was 5pm, and we were in a hurry to get down to the beach before the sun went down. We simply did not appreciate waiting over 30 minutes for our luggage, not to mention the 15 minutes it took at check-in to simply get the correct room. The beach in front of this hotel at 5:30pm on a Sunday was disgusting! Granted it was late on a weekend, but to me it's not an execuse. The Ritz-Carlton actually charges a 14% resort fee, which covers the beach chairs, etc. However, it is obvious by the pathetic condition of the beach chairs, that they put none of that money into equipment or for cleaning the beach. I personally think that charging a resort fee sucks, but even more so when it's a percentage of the room price. That means the more you pay to stay in the hotel, the more it costs to use the facilities. It seems like it should be the opposite of that concept. If the property does charge a resort fee, shouldn't it be a flat rate? If I am in a suite, do I use more of the beach then the guest in the cheapest rooms? Sorry, just a pet peeve of mine, back to the review. We ate dinner at the beach side restaurant. The service was terrible, the food was average, but grossly overpriced as is the food at most hotels. The chairs were suppose to have cushions, but none did. And worst of all, you can't see the ocean at all, only the pool. We then tried to get coffee in the lobby bar, they only had one waitress for the entire lobby bar, so it took forever to order and longer to just get a cup of coffee! The location of this hotel is great if you are trying to stay close to the airport. The casino is okay, but nothing special. Overall, I would avoid this hotel.

My reason for doing so this time is because I was SO disappointed in the Ritz San Juan, having stayed at several Ritz Carltons in the states, each multiple times. First of all, way overpriced (for what you get). The room: smelly, dirty/stained carpet, dusty, looked like a Motel 6 as far as in class, bed as hard as a rock, shower liner dirty (had to ask for it to be replaced), and difficulty with changing rooms. Oh, let me not forget our room's view included the roof of some small attachment and all we saw was dirty roof and pipes, surrounded by trees so we were unable to see the \"beauty\" of the back pool/patio area. And they wondered why we wanted to try another room. I also had a spa appt booked but I canceled because I wasnt sure what to expect there.

I ended up moving to a larger room with an ocean view because I wasn't happy with the original. The larger room had TWO air conditioning zones that operated the same way. The biggest disappointment to me was that after spending an additional 400 plus a night I didn't get a room with clean fixtures or carpets. Everything needed a good re-furbishing. Having recently returned from the Ritz Carlton in Grand Cayman, I was really surprised at the lack of attention to detail in the rooms. I paid the same for both rooms at the two properties, but the quality was completely different (yes, the SJ is older but still).

Basically I expected a pleasurable experience but received a letdown in several are I was taking friends and business associates away for a special getaway. All rooms were booked weeks ago and were supposed to be charged to my credit card. We sent the authorization form and called several times to verify before my arrival. 1) I was told when I called concierge that BLT and IL Mulino required jackets to be worn by the men. This was not the case and caused my guests and I to bring jackets when not needed. 2) Upon check in , I advised front desk that all charges were to be invoiced to my credit card for all guests. They confirmed , however when I checked out charges were going to be billed XXXX's room. In addition , all invoices were left under my guests doors when they were supposed to be left under mine. When I called guest services to remedy the situation it took 10 minutes to find someone at front desk because they dont pick up the phones. 3) I was told upon my first night of arrival that Ocean Bar served sandwiches and hamburgers for dinner, however when I arrived they only served sushi for dinner and we could not order sandwiches and hamburgers. One of my guests does not eat fish so it was uncomfortable for them. 4) Pool- beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lounge chairs in poor dirty condition . Bathrooms near tennis courts, dirty and need better maintenance. 5) When ordering food or drinks at pool long waits because of under staffing. Thus, quality was not good.

I don't know if it's because I have high expectations or if the service was really as poor as it I think it is. A day before my Birthday my friend & I were over at the property's beach when the hotel beach concierge approached us for small talk. My friend had mentioned to him that we were there to enjoy our time as well as to celebrate my birthday the following day. It appeared that the concierge made a note of it, even asked for my name & wrote it down. The following day there wasn't even a Birthday card in my room, nothing. Later on the day both my friend & I approached the concierge desk to make dinner reservations for the evening, asking them for a suggestion & also informing them that it's to celebrate my Birthday....they recommended a beautiful Italian restaurant with the best service & cosine I've experienced during my trip but they failed to inform the restaurant of the special occasion. The following evening I approached the front desk for concierge advise (since concierge was gone for the evening & f/d played the part of front desk & concierge) but it appeared that the front desk personnel didn't have any basic concierge knowledge. The agent couldn't provide with any recommendations. Being that it's a 4 or 5 star hotel, all of the above should have been handled better. Towards the end of my stay one of the front desk agents asked me if I was enjoying my stay with them which gave me the opportunity to express how I really felt. I informed her that I particularly took this trip & chose their hotel to have a perfect Birthday, but instead, it was overlooked even after several reminders. I have to say, it's one of the worst Birthday celebrations I've had in a long time. It took less then an hour for this kind front desk agent (woman) to organize their management team to personally deliver a Birthday cake along with balloons to my room. I was impressed. The problem wasn't entirely corrected, but it did make me feel acknowledged. Having to lay out by the pool side I expected to be pampered, but the only amenity they offered was water w/ice.

Overall, this is a very nice property and probably the nicest in San Juan. My last visit to a tropical island was to the big island of Hawaii where we stayed at the Fairmont Orchid which used to be a Ritz Carlton. I thought that in comparison, that that property was nicer and the landscaping spectacular in comparison but that is perhaps unfair. San Juan does not look like Hawaii and the nearby buildings and city appearance took me back at first. With the exception of Old San Juan, I found I needed to try and disregard this during my stay. San Juan is easy to get to from the east coast however. I liked that you could get everywhere on the Ritz property quickly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the resort is large but not sprawling. We had a corner oceanfront room with a balcony which was a bit pricey, but to us, this was worth the extra. We found that by juggling the dates a few days in either direction and eliminating a Saturday we were able to save a lot of money when booking. (We booked via whatahotel.com and got breakfast and resort food credit included). Air conditioning in the hotel is erratic and may be poorly engineered. Hallways are frigid, and even though your room can get very cool, on humid days, the A/C does not seem good at getting rid of the moisture. We had a wonderful panoramic view and corner windows (although the thermal seal in one of the windows was damaged and the window was fogged), of the beach and coastline. The bathroom was probably the nicest I have ever had in any hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very large double vanity and high enough so you do not get a backache; all marble, plenty of room and shelves to store your toiletries, separate oversized shower stall with bench, tub and separate toilet; great towels and nice Ritz toiletries; Ipod docking player included and nice assortment of teas and coffee in the room; good housekeeping service, but very poor and slow in-room wireless service Large newer flat screen was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however, we have noticed that no hotels seem to have hi def yet. All of the common areas are exceptionally nice and overall well-kept but I thought the hallways were narrow. The beach and pool areas are really quite wonderful with wonderful azure ocean but pool is not heated as others noted. There are plenty of chaises and umbrellas (part of your resort fee) even at 100% occupancy. The weather was fantastic and March is a good month to visit. Some of the chaise lounges and beach snack tables could use re-doing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they take a beating. There are a few other worn areas in the hotel but this is quite minimal and they seemed to be freshening and painting. The staff is , kind and for the most part very competent. They genuinely want you to have a wonderful stay but not all of them are on the same page. A few of the waiters at breakfast went off the air, asking if you wanted more coffee and then never returning, but, then on the other hand, was someone like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carolina\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who was exceptionally pleasant and efficient and suggested some wonderful juices for us to try. If you can ask to be at her station for breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you should! As far as being pampered, I think that at Ritz prices, one expects this and I would agree with the other posters. There was not adequate service at the beach for food or drinks. Someone we flagged down said he would be right back and never came, so my husband walked up to the beach bar and got his own drink, etc. When they set up your chairs early in the day, they say they will be taking care of you all day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but only a couple times during the week did anyone come around again to see if we wanted or needed anything. As far as food, breakfast was great and they had so many choices, omelette station and fantastic guava pancakes that actually look like they are baked in mini bundt pans. They stop serving at 11 so try and arrive well before that time. Sparkling Cava is available if you want to have Mimosas, beautiful outdoor setting also. We also ate at BLT steak house in the hotel which was very good if typical high end steak house as well as trying Il Mullino, the latter being extremely over-priced and even pretentious. A NYC Italian best reserved for those with expense accounts. It seems as if few hotels these days have 24 hour informal options if you just want to get some ice-cream or a light snack for example. This is limited to room service or in the lounge. I heard that the Marriott down the beach had an ice cream parlor which we missed. The other advantages of staying at the Ritz is that you are short walk to other area hotels that offer dining and shopping options and there is a convenient Walgreens about a half block away. You are close by to the El San Juan which has wonderful shops and a few restaurants - we tried Koco which was disappointing. (I am writing separate reviews of the restaurants). We also ate at Baru and Jose Jose both of which were excellent. If you wanted to visit San Juan but did not want to pay the price of the Ritz Carlton, I would suggest you take a look at the Intercontinental. We walked through the hotel and their public areas, beach and pool were quite impressive. I would probably not stay at the El San Juan although I would visit.

At 4 o'clock, they fired up the diesel-powered ATV to move all the beach chairs up close to the poolside fence. The smell and sound of that were lovely. Evidently, that's a daily occurrence.

This time, we were just passing though on our way to another island. Because we were arriving after midnight, the plan was to stay at the Ritz before catching an afternoon flight. It's location near the airport made it seem ideal. We had specified through our travel agent that we needed either 2 double beds and a rollaway or a King with a sofabed and a rollaway (we have two kids and one is fairly tall and hard to share a bed with). The last time we stayed at this Ritz, we had a King bed and a Queen Sofabed and that's what I figured we were getting. WRONG. On checking in at 2am, we were informed that there were no rollaways available (I was concerned that this might happen). Oh well, go to Plan B and have the kids share the Sofabed. When we arrived in the King bed room, it was clear that it was the tiniest room, barely fitting the bed, two chairs and a bulky armoir for the TV...and no sofabed. After calling the front desk, we were told that the sofabed was \"on it's way\". Really?? I couldn't imagine them moving a sofabed into this room, much less in the middle of the night. Sure enough two guys arrived from housekeeping with what appeared to be a \"chair and a half\" on a dolly which they proceeded to wrestle into the room (after removing one of the chairs). By now it was well after 3am. They opened the bed and to no one's surprise by this point, a twin mattress unfolded. It was therefore the teen's unlucky lot to get this sleeping arrangement (did I mention that the mattress was covered with plastic that crinkled all night?). The younger child had to sleep with Mom & Dad. At $700 a night, not what any of us had in mind. There was barely room to walk around the bed and one of us had to use the bathroom to open the small carry-on bag we brought. I would have much preferred that they told us upfront that we couldn't be accommodated. We were offered a meal credit, but what I really wanted was a \"sleep credit\".

Wife and I went for 5 nights and had a nearly pefect vacation for our anniversary. The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. Our room was spotless and better than I'd expected. This hotel made us feel like we were the most important guests there. Reading some of these reviews make me wonder where these people stayed. HUGE appreciation to the conseirge desk. They took the time to find us restaurants based on what WE wanted to eat and not what they thought all the tourists wanted. Made reservations for us and made sure everynight was an anniversary dinner. I recommend the package that includes Oceabfront Balcony with a $100 resort credit and the upscale buffet breakfast. The Club Level Package is probably better for people with kids but it seemed like a hassle to me as I didnl;t want to hav to walk back into the hotel and go to the 10th floor to get a fre drink. The breakfast buffet was excellent everyday. The drinks pool and beach side are about $6 for a beer and around $10-12 for tropical drinks and the food is $10-$20 and very good. To me, this was very reasonable for a Ritz Carlton and the service was prompt and easy. As others have stated, there is a decent liquor store and food store less then 3 minutes from the hotel that you can bye stuff at if you really want to save money...BUT then WHY go to a Ritz Carlton?? Casino was also a blast and the best in the area. Fun atmosphere. SO for those of you that need to know that I'm not paid by the hotel to write a nice review, here you go, My complaints - or rather, ways that the Ritz can improve: 1) The Birds: Too many aggresive birds at the pool. We opted not to eat breakfast outside in the morning because the birds would land right on your table and try to peck at your plate. I'm not a bird lover at all and I'd prefer to have them crated away. Good forbid someone left an empty plate of food a few seats over from you at the pool or beach, a horde of nirds will be all over you in a few minutes. STILL - We loved the place. 2) The Basketball Net: Some one had the dumb idea of putting a basketball net right under the wing of the hotel that has the most expensive rooms. It should be moved well away from the rooms near the tennis courts (come on people - think about). So, a couple of kids one morning decided to go out there at 8:00 a.m. and start shooting around. Even being on the 7th floor with our balcony door closed, we could still hear it. Really lame idea. BUT - I called down to the front desk to complain an they put a stop to it in under 3 minutes. I was impressed. 3) Hallways Too Cold: Yes, I'm reaching on this actually being a complaint. I love cranking up the AC but the hallways were absolutely frigid and I was shaking by the time I got to the elevators. 4) The Front Desk: Slightly understaffed - We had a bit of a wait and always saw a line of people waiting and they just need to be a little more attentive. To check out we were standing there and decided to slip over to the conseirge desk and they took care of us promptly. 5) Too many New Yorkers/New Jerseyians..... What are you going to do? I guess the Ritz can't offer lessons on how to teach basic courtesy. OK people - there are others trying to relax at the pool so keep the volume down. Hint: If I'm 30 feet away and can hear every word, pipe down. 6) Airport Noise: Yeah we heard the planes once in awhile but it was not load at all and never bothered us and we slept with the balcony doors open everynight. WE WILL BE BACK...but again without the kids.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seat 1C, Delta Airlines", "Title": "\u201cHas Great Potential, But Pales to Most Ritz Carltons\u201d", "Author": "kingofsp8s", "ReviewID": "UR96926280", "Content": "Stayed on Marriott Points; am platinum with Marriott and was hoping status would carry over, but no such luck. Reserved an oceanfront room, which I got, but the definition of oceanfront is a bit marginal as it was more like \"parking lot front\" or \"over the entertainment patio front\". If you reserve, be sure to ask for as high a floor as possible to enjoy. Also, be aware that there are heavily travelled housekeeping closets near these rooms and the doors start slamming around 9 a.m. and the half dozen housekeepers/maintenance people do not have that \"seen but not heard\" presence that I'm used to in other RC's. Having come in late the night before it was an irritant. Given that I was travelling on points, and still sucked into the $60/night resort fee, this became a big nuisance. All in all, if you need a hotel and can spend the money, get it including the club level. It's clean, good facilities overall, and very close to the airport so if you're just trying to get a few days away, it works. Some other tips: 1) Rent a car; the taxi rides to OSJ are $20 each way and tip balance of food costs greatly towards the hotel restaurants. 2) Reserve the Enterprise car (on hotel property) on-line and use your corporate discounts. Reserve for 30 minutes before the intended time as they don't keep cars on property. 3) Beware of BLT (at least). I was nervous because of the reviews on prices, but they were no different than NYC which I've frequented a number of times. However, the food quality was at whole level lower, which was disappointing...I think they retrned more popovers than were eaten that night. 4) Have patience; the front desk is understaffed and constantly has lines. They genuinely want to help, but again, compared to expectations and previous experience, not well trained. Again a bit disappointing. Now that I've experienced PR, I feel a lot more confidennt to try other options; the Courtyard looked decently located. Also, in looking to use points, would also be taking a stronger look at the Hilton or making the journey over to Vieques.

This was our first time staying at a Ritz Carlton Property and for the most part we were NOT disappointed. The Lobby is very beautiful with all of it's marble and beautiful flowers, plants, decor and shops. Their is even a Tiffany's inside of this hotel! The hotel has a beautiful pool and their private part of the beach is kept clean with a vast supply of chairs, clean towels and umbrellas. The employees their work very hard to accomodate the guests with umbrellas and chairs. We were checked into a nice room with a comfortable bed and a city view. However, our A/C leaked and caused a wet spot on the carpet. When we notified the front desk facilities came to fix it, but it still leaked. And they did not offer to transfer us to another room, so that part of their service was not above our expectations. However, the service of others was fantastic! The doorman, was very resourceful, friendly and kind. He gave us great recommendations for restuarants and shops. Our favorite resturants were Cafe Puerto Rico @ 208 O'Donnel , Plaza Col\u00c3\u00b3n AND Sofia Italian Kitchen & Bar @ San Francisco St 355 both in Old San Juan. But for breakfast we LOVED a little cafe about 2 blocks from the Ritz called Pui Bello @ Rosa Street #2, Isla Verde! Their breakfast was delicious and cheaply priced. Also, they served yummy Gelato from the morning until late at night. Personally, we did not choose to eat in any of the hotel resturants but decided to go out and eat since it was more reasonable and so we could experience Puerto Rican cruisine such as Mofongo & Tostones. The other reason I gave their service an excellent rating is because of one of the ladies at the front desk. While on one of their elevators my daughter stepped in a wad of gum someone dropped on the floor. I went to the front desk to inform them, so they could get a facilities person to clean it up. Not only did she note it, but she came around from the front desk with a tissue and scissors in hand and proceeded to scrape the gum off of my daughters shoes! I was very impressed with her assistance!! FYI - English is spoken by a large majority of the wonderful people of Puerto Rico as it is taught in their schools and since they are a US Territory. So we did not experience a language barrier while visiting. Another plus for the property is the location! It was a great location and we could walk to local resturants & shops or walk a 1/2 block to the bus stop where you can take one bus directly to Old San Juan. We felt safe walking around this part of town which is funny because I have a dear friend who lives in PR, but had never been to San Juan because her mother \"warned\" her of the \"crime\" in San Juan! So she and her son came to San Juan and stayed across the street at the Hampton Inn (I think) and joined us while we visited and she couldn't believe how nice it was...that is so funny to me!

I was going to avoid it based on the reviews here, and it was delicious as well. This is no holiday inn, and the prices reflect island life. I'm not surprised by the prices, but I wonder if the people who are shocked have just not ever been to resorts in the caribbean. This is no different than any other higher end resort you'll find in the caribbean. I am generally happy to be in the sunshine and vacation and make the best of wherever I find myself. I didn't have to make the best of it, it was exactly what I was expecting. The personnel in the club lounge learned our names and always were friendly and helpful. If you are debating, don't debate, the beach is nice, the pool is nice, service great, hotel elegant, clean, comfortable.

The reviews for this Ritz made me hesitate booking for a little bit. I researched and chose this hotel...and cannot complain! I have stayed at many Ritz (Chicago, Palm Beach, Key Biscayne, Jamaica, New York, etc.) and this is comparable if not better. I am the pickiest of travelers and a hotel has to go out of its way to allow me to give them 5 stars. Rooms The rooms were clean, flat screen TVs, big comfy beds. In fact, everytime I would leave the room it would be re-cleaned. We had double bed room on the club level (highly recommended). Yes the hotel is close to the airport but you will not hear them in your room and barely notice anything at the pool (the approach pattern does not take planes over the hotel). Food BLT and El Mulino are my two favorite new restaurants. El Mulino was amazing! Best italian hands down and worth every penny. BLT was the same with an amazing steak! Both had magnificent service! The only food that is mediocre is the food by the pool during lunch. They should have a more fresh selection (fresh guacamole, etc.) I notified the chef that they should call the Key Biscayne Ritz for recipe for there burgers. We ate lunch and breakfast everyday at the Club Level Lounge, again I stress to get this you get unlimited drinks. Casino This is a great mid-sized casino. Perfect for the ritz. It is very well kept and has great dealers! Carlos, Mimi, etc. are the nicest people you will ever meet and will teach you how to play any game. They have $10 tables penny slots etc. As long as you are seated at a table they will bring you free drinks and a selection of sandwiches. The casino is open 24/7. Staff Staff were very good! Always greeted you by name. After everything they gave us they would ask if it was to our satisfaction. If it was not, you would not need to pay. Got a turkey burger by the pool, did not like it, refunded immediately. The staff are willing to go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy your trip. They def. are the best ritz staff I have ever experienced. Spa I got a massage. Nothing special. Pool Great large pool area. Clean. Always staff there to help. Beach Amazing! Overall Great hotel.

While the Ritz has many great properties, their resort offerings fall woefully short of the level of quality, service & facilities you'd expect from a premium brand. Billed as a resort, the Ritz San Juan is something in-between a glorified airport hotel and a mid-level beach resort. The clientele was mostly cheesy Jersey types who seemed glad to be overpaying for a mediocre pool, beach & disappointing dining options. For $1000/night, you can do much better; we originally tried to stay at the St. Regis (Bahia) but the place was fully booked 6 months in advance -- after driving there to play golf one day, I could see why. For the same price, the difference in the 2 \"comparable\" resorts was staggering. If you're looking for something more in the Four-Seasons-or-better vein, I recommend looking into the St. Regis. Or, if you're looking for a more authentic vacation experience, skip the main island altogether and research some of the more charming options in the nearby islands of Vieques & Culebra.

It was earlier than check-in time but the front desk agent quickly worked to find rooms that were ready for myself and my colleague. Despite our early arrival, I entered my room to find a welcome gift on my pillow. The room was clean and modern - nothing jaw dropping, but nice enough. I had a view of the pool -would have preferred a beach view but I didn't pay for/ask for any alternate view so it was fine with me. The concierge was always willing and able to assist with my requests during my stay. The beach access was absolutely wonderful. I didn't check out any of the signature restaurants because I preferred to venture out and get local cuisine, but I did try out the breakfast buffet and it was excellent - great quality, variety, and service. All in all, I was pretty pleased with my experience. The staff was extremely helpful and service-oriented, and although I was prepared to speak Spanish, seemingly everyone in the hotel spoke English. The location for me was great because it was convenient to the airport without being next door, yet an easy drive over the bridge to the business district. Visiting Old San Juan is fun but it's tough to stay in that area with the small roads and impossible traffic. For my purposes, Carolina was a good homebase to get to everywhere I was going. If you stay here though - unless you plan spend your entire vacation hopping between the beach and the casino (nothing wrong with that!) - you may want to rent a car. Only other notable point - I got a good rate in December but when planning my next business trip, I was unable to stay here due to the crazy prices. The rate literally increased 1000%, I know we're approaching the high season for Puerto Rico but $2,000 per night is a tad over the top!

If we had to do it over again, we would have looked into renting the car fewer days, and from the hotel.)

Our room was very nice and clean and well appointed. The hotel lobby, restaurants and outside areas were all very nice. Everything was kept very clean. The beach was very nice also and the sand was very soft. The servers were all very attentive, especially at the restaurant, BLT. At night, at the outdoor patio area, the small tree frogs would perform a virtual symphony every night. I really enjoyed listening to them. One of the best parts of our stay was our Concierge, Luis. He was truly a very kind person and very helpful. He really bent over backwards to provide everything we needed, from making reservations, to providing us with information on all the areas we wanted to visit, to taking pictures of us. He was the best! And since it was our 25th anniversary, he surprised us with a nice card and a picture of us that he had taken. Guest Relations at the hotel also gave us a nice picture frame for our anniversary; totally unexpected and very much appreciated. I don't have really anything negative to say about our stay. The only thing is that if you stay at the Ritz, do not expect bargain prices on the food. The food and drinks are all pretty expensive, so don't stay there if you want to save money. Everything I had read on Puerto Rico had said that driving in Puerto Rico was a challenge. That's an understatement. The Ritz has a large parking garage with plenty of parking and it is very convenient.. It is fairly expensive as guests pay 17.00 a night. We had rented a car and the first day we were there, we drove to Old San Juan. The local drivers don't really follow normal traffic rules. A stop sign is basically just a suggestion. The streets in Old San Juan are very narrow and really crowded with cars all over. We had kind of a hard time finding the parking lots. But once we got parked, we walked all over the city and that was alot of walking, but we really enjoyed it. The next day, we drove to Ponce. As we found out later, it would have been better to go on the weekend since traffic was a nightmare on Friday with everyone going to and from work. The trip back to the hotel that day was very harrowing and we only arrived safely by the grace of God. We went to El Junque rain forest on Sunday with a tour. I would not have gone if we had to drive ourselves. We ended up getting on a tour from the hotel, so that was alot better than driving ourselves.

Upon arrival at the hotel, we were forced to wait in a very long extended line for over 20 minutes and instead of being checked in quietly, I felt as if I was at a cattle round up. It was far from relaxing. I then proceed to check into the room and the carpeting was not clean, the shower curtain was stained and for an added touch in the adjacent chamber where the commode was located was an extra bulb on the commode in case the l;ights went out. I must say it added a self service quality to the aura of the room. I then proceed to the overcrowded pool with the stained mats covering the chairs. After waiting awhile, it was self service for the towels and then a pool boy did put this on our chairs after we beckoned to him to assist us. However it was so crowded and so dirty that everytime, I got up from the lounge chair the dirtly glasses someone left on the next table would spill all over me. I figured order a Margarita. It was like an imposition and I did recieve my margarita with no cocktail napkins. After waiting 15 minutes, I was given napkins. I figured maybe the beach would work - it should be called more of a mud puddle and instead of a relaxing atomoshpere I thought I must have jumped into a muddy beach.. That everning, I figured relax - have a martini and I had to wait 15 minutes to ask someone to wait on us. After that we had what I thought would be a very pleasant evening at Il Molino. Wrong again, there were screaming children and I do not blame the children but parents who show no consideration for others The level of the restaurant was not the quality of it's New York counterpart.. Ok - the evening passed and the next day, I took a shower and reached for a towel - it was makeup stained, tried another also, makeup stained and as previously mentioned the shower curtain had stains on it too inside and out at least consuistent.. We all checked out and the best value was the La Concha Hotel that I will describe. with a hip cool vibe and excellent service.

The staff was incredible and our every need was not only met, it was anticipated. Our room had a view of the front of the hotel and parking lot and was very basic. The windows were double-paned hurricane windows so the noise from the airport (the airport is very, very, very close to the hotel) did not bother us. It rained quite a bit while we were there but we couldn't even hear the rain right outside our window. The housekeeping staff cleaned and restocked it twice a day and we always had fresh towels, coffee, tea, water, etc. Our only problem in the room was the fact that the shower curtain liner is made from fabric. When we would shower the water would leak through the curtain and drip onto the floor! The housekeeping staff replaced the shower curtain twice, but we had the problem all week. We would simply tell the housekeeping staff when we left our room that the shower had leaked and it would be cleaned up upon our return. The wait staff in the lobby lounge and restaurants were incredible. They could not do enough to make our stay as lovely as possible. I wasn't impressed with the hotel gift shop or the staff there. The woman stood behind the counter the entire time we were shopping. Not once did she offer to help us with our shopping. The spa was FANTASTIC!! My massage was SO good that I was almost asleep. That has never happened to me before. I wanted to have another body treatment but we ran out of time. The pool and beach area were gorgeous with plenty of pool attendants to get us towels, make \"pillows\" for our lounge chairs and bring us ice water. The property is gated and there is a door which requires key access. This was for guest safety as leaving the room at night was not recommended. During the day, it was gorgeous!! We ate at BLT Steakhouse which was delicious but very expensive! The casino was a lot of fun, but as we are not gamblers we didn't spend much time or money there. We did manage to win a little bit of money which made it fun!!

Despite what you might read in some reviews, this is HARDLY a threadbare, poor substitute of the Ritz standard that some have asserted in a few of these reviews. It is not an \"ultra\" luxurious hotel, but it is a well-appointed, up-to-date luxury hotel with great pool and beach, two fine restaurants and one that's fine for breakfast / dinner. The casino is \"fine\" - if you're into them. The staff is attentive and professional. What could be better? #1 Location in relation to the most popular San Juan attraction - Old San Juan It's a bit of a hike to get from the hotel to the city's best attraction. Not a huge hassle. The cab fare is about $20 - not too bad, and cabs are plentiful. Also, if you do want to rent a car, perhaps to drive the El Junque rainforest - about an hour away, there is an on-site Enterprise rental location that charges fair rates. #2 The neighborhood - not the worst part of San Juan, but not the best either When you take the (very short) cab ride from the airport, you'll probably pass the \"Cockfights\" arena - walking distance to the hotel. \"Nuff said? #3 We thought the rates were good, but you get dinged on food expense and there are not too many decent alternatives close by If you have breakfast for 4 at the Ritz, you'll be plunking down ~$100 (+ tax and tip). It's a little thing, but there is no free coffee service for early risers. #4 San Juan's \"contradiction\" a tourist destination vs. a real-life city with real stresses San Juan is partially \"built\" for tourists, but is not the vacationer pure-play that many other island are. It's also NOT the Dominican or Jamaica with the grinding poverty that is kept at arm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s-length when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sealed up in some resort. As a little example, the day before we arrived, the FBI sent in 750 agents from the States to join with the agents stationed in Puerto Rico to roundup and arrest over 130 Puerto Rican police and corrections officers who are accused of providing protection to drug dealers. Also, the total murder rate stood at about 750 through mid-October, which is about 10 times the total number of homicides in the greater Boston metropolitan area. Are you likely to come to an untimely end in Puerto Rico as a tourist (assuming you're not completely stupid)? - Of course not, but when you ride through or by certain parts of the city, or even rural areas well outside San Juan, you are constantly reminded that you're somewhere between the \"First\" and \"Third\" worlds. Bottom line: Do go. Don't worry if you're booking at the Ritz. There are some other large all-inclusive resorts that are an hour+ ride from the airport - if you don't want to negotiate the complexities of San Juan. If you go, and even if you do stay at one of the resorts, try to stay a day or two in or close to San Juan, and DO walk though Old San Juan. It's a great part of the city, with attractions like the great fort El Moro that date back to the 1500's. There are also great restaurants there (with plenty of fine and honest recommendations on Trip Advisor).", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "philadelphia, pa", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel but next time would stay at the El San Juan\u201d", "Author": "karenandsteve", "ReviewID": "UR85492654", "Content": "I read the reviews on this hotel.

The location to the airport is great - about 10/15 minutes and $11. The lobby and common areas of the property are also very inviting. Kudos overall goes to the staff (excluding front desk staff, which I'll get to). The doormen, bell staff, security guards, Club Level staff, etc., were just lovely. I especially appreciated that they went to the effort of learning our names. We stayed on floor 9 (not sure if that's meant to have nicer rooms) and the room was just average. It was very clean and the coffee machine was good, but it wasn't what I would expect from the Ritz. (I've had nicer, more modern rooms at Holiday Inn). The pillows were also very regular ... even the non-feather request I had was met with a very limp pillow. Other reviewers mention that this is an older property .... I could see that from the quality of the rooms. My biggest concern was the level of service at the front desk. It took a very long time to check in, and once we were served, it was not adequate. We were upsold a room on Club level for $150 per night for a party of three (plus $30/night in tax that wasn't mentioned!). The desk staff however did not check the reservation to realise that we had two rooms, so once we agreed and she realised her mistake, all of a sudden the charge was $300 and she didn't even bring it to our attention. When we were queried the mistake (ie, $300 instead of $150), it didn't even seem to matter that the mistake was made by the hotel. I had to ask to speak with a manager before any concessions were made. I haven't stayed at a Ritz before, but I would have expected better customer service - either the mistake shouldn't have happened in the first place, or the guest would not be made to pay for the mistake of the staff. The hotel food is expensive as others point out (that's why we upgraded to Club level), but unless you drink enough it might not be worth it.

Housekeeping came twice a day to clean up and give new towels, water, amenities, etc. Concierge would help give the best advise possible. Servers were always around and made sure you were taken care of. The beach and pool were very nice. Great place to lounge around on a warm day. The airplane noise never bothered me, especially if you get a room facing in toward the pool or beach, as I never heard a plane while inside at all. You would hear a plane take off on occasion when outside, but not really distracting. Also, keep in mind you are in a largely Spanish speaking country, so some staff may have a little trouble communicating. Especially if you are rude and pushy yourself. Some staff spoke only English. Did see a few Latin American travelers who were demanding and would not wait for answers or help, but I see that everywhere. The hotel was very nice. A little wear outside from being in a tropical environment, but expect this anywhere in the tropics. Il Molino (italian restaurant at hotel) was amazing, but very pricey). BLT Steakhouse was very good as well. The Lobby lounge had some very good appetizers (especially the prime rib flatbread special), and has 1/2 price drinks from 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm. Helps cut down on the $9 regular price. Go next door to Spice (fun bar) for $5.50 drinks at night. Hotel can be expensive (but I found a deal for 2 nights free).

The beach is fabulous and perfect if you have kids, but there were not many kids at the hotel. The beach is flat and wide directly in front of the hotel. The pool is a bit small but very nice. The patio is great. The pool servers take so long to get you a drink you would think it is an all inclusive resort. They are however very nice and always say \"my pleasure!\" I bought beers at the market 10 minutes away and got no flack for drinking them right at the pool. In fact they brought me ice for my little bucket! The rooms were very nice, but the halls leading to the rooms felt a little Holiday Inn. The beach, pool, and common areas were all very Ritz. There are two restaurants in the hotel. The Italian restaurant was bleh. BLT was fabulous! The bar in the lobby, felt like a bar in the lobby. It did not have the nice club feel of most Ritz properties. The El San Juan is walking distance. They have an fabulous lobby scene with live music. However the rooms are crappy and loud. I advise that you stay at the Ritz and walk over to the El San Juan hotel for the night life. There are also tons of great bars on the way there if you need a breather beer.

My husband, our 3-year old son and I were in the pool all the time.

We've been on Mexican vacations where the pool is so cold that I don't go in the water at all and our little boy can only stay in for a short time without shivering, but this pool was wonderful. The water at the beach was also warm and the beach attendants were quick to set up chairs, umbrellas and towels.Food and beverage service at the pool and beach was great. Room - Our room faced the pool and ocean and was spacious and clean. The bed was super comfortable with Frette linens and down pillows and comforter. It was also quiet for the most part and dark so we all slept really well. Food - All of the food at the hotel is expensive. A latte is $8 at the hotel (they don't have a coffee shop, need to go to the restaurant), a mojito at the pool was $14 and on the kids menu breakfast was $12 for 1 egg and 1 strip of bacon! I have to say I thought that was rediculously overpriced. Right around the corner from the hotel (less than 5 minute walk) is Denny's (kids meal for $3) and Piu Bello offered reasonably priced breakfast so we opted for that most days. At the hotel, we had dinner at Il Mulino (Italian restaurant) and the atmosphere and service was great but the food was only average. We thought it wasn't worth the price. We also ate at BLT (steakhouse at the hotel) and the food was fantastic...the bill was over $200 but worth it. The concierge also recommended several other good nearby restaurants. Walgreens is also right around the corner from the hotel so we stocked up on some snacks for the week. Spa - The spa is lovely, don't miss out on the complimentary seated chair massage available anytime to anyone (don't need to be a spa guest).

Stand around screaming that you don't like the bed or want a bottle of boons' farm NOW, or don't understand why your room isn't ready when you get there at 1:07 pm is going to get you butkus. Be aware that check in is 4pm and check out is 12pm. It's possible to get in earlier but don't count on it, especially in high season. This is a full service hotel so drinks are going to cost over $10, room service will cost more than going to your local diner and not taste as good as grandma's . The bar area/ living room is a nice place to get a lite dinner or snack in a casual setting. Orlando the bartender is funny and knowledgeable about the local area. BLT and iL Molino are the two restaurants. They are typical steakhouses, water will cost $7 , steaks will be $40 and if you want a veggie that will cost too, just like ate every steak house in America. That's how steak houses work. The dining spaces are fairly small and have gentlemen's club like feel. If you want a slick , white marble Italian experience then La Piccola at the Waldorf (formerly the Wyndham) is your place. If you want action with your steak the Palm is in the same hotel. Other eating options outside but nearby the hotel are Metropol across the street for PR /cuban cusine. Service is hit or miss. If you speak Spanish and don't look like a tourist your chances for good service are better but not guaranteed. There is a Denny's about a block down to the right but it's nothing special. Piu Bello is just past the Wallgreens also on the right and has great orange juice and a good breakfast selection with a cheerful staff. Pickup a local map there too. They also have lunch and lite dinner selections served all day too. Platos is also nearby for local dishes and is pretty good, not spectacular, and service friendly, competent but leisurely, I think the kitchen is tiny. Live music on the weekends. Casino is handy , but the one at the Waldorf is better. Business center is on of the best around in my opinion. Isla Verde is a bit remote, you'll need a car / bus/ cab to take you to see anything but the beach. A cab into old town is @ $20-25. You can get the T5 city bus for $.75 outside to take you to old town. It's fine as long as you don't come-go during rush hour when it's very crowded and can take an hour.

One example of the outstanding service we received is as follows: at 1:00 am our son became ill; we called the front desk for Pepto Bizmo, whereby the service agent made arrangements for security to open the gift-store, retrieve the medicine, and deliver to our room all in less than 10 minuets. Then our son heaved on the carpet, we called guest services and again is less than 10 minutes staff cleaned the mess; more than pleased we were.

Cold meats, boiled eggs, danishes, croissants and lots of fresh fruit along with all juices and coffee. No hot food!!!! Lunch was meat and veggie sandwiches with a panini press machine. Green salads with assorted toppings. Fresh Tuna and chicken salad. Assorted cheeses, breads, desserts. It got a bit repetitive after 4 days of the same or similar items. But it was great. The best was free drinks from noon to 9:30 daily. The mojitos were great and so were the martini's. Grey goose and Kettle one were available. The cost of drinks around the hotel were $17 for a martini and $12 for a mojito. Overall, the club level was amazing and well worth the price. The staff were amazing. They did all job functions from checking you in, arranging tours, car rentals , serving the food, played bar tender and welcomed you by name every time they saw you. It was absolutely great. The rooms were the same size as the lower level rooms but had several added amenities. The pool view was great. The club lounge has a living room setting with couches, tables and even a balcony over lookin the pool / beach with tables so you could eat outside. The pool area is the nicest I have ever seen.

The pool staff were extremely accommodating and set us up with chairs, towels etc and never expected a tip. But they deserved every $ I gave them. We ate at BLT....it was an average steakhouse. Go to other local options and save the steak for a local steakhouse in your town. Marmalade rated as the 2nd best in san juan was amazing. The pre fixe is awesome and the entire experience was \"fetch\". Also, metropole across the street has reasonable and good P.R food. Atlantica , a 4 min cab ride was the best sea food ever.

They even had the nerve to bring the bottle out to serve it! The lounge staff were great however, which more than makes up for any issues. If you just want to \"fill up\" on filler food and alcohol than it's a good deal, but certainly not a culinary experience by any means. Most guests did just that - piled up on heaps of pale off-white, textureless food and washed it down with cocktails and Korbel. Just adding some fresh fruit to the presentation would make it more appealing. No hot items at all in 9 days. They consider cold salads as their evening hors deurves. If you ask the staff for anything they will do their best to get it for you however. Enough about the lounge. We enjoyed most of the staff, but felt the pool/beach staff could have provided more of a luxury experience by setting up chairs/umbrellas, and serving water/chilled fruit without having to be asked. After being stung all over by jelly fish I asked for assistance and was handed a small cloth with vinegar prior to the attendant walking away - how was I to reach the stings on my back? Many, many more children than one would typically expect at a Ritz. Fine, but made the whole experience much less relaxing with Marco Polo all day in the pool. Also, the towels in the room were threadbare, and pool towels faded/stained blue with musty smell. I am talking about rags - not exaggerating here.

The trip was amazing. San Juan is a beautiful island, the people couldn't be nicer, the food is delicious, and the drinks are always flowing. The staff at the Ritz was very friendly, helpful, and attentive - welcoming us with happy anniversary wishes and complimentary champagne at our anniversary dinner at BLT. We had a city view room, which was plenty nice, that was cleaned daily and \"turned down\" each night. A quick side note, book the San Salvador Rainforest Ziplining & Rappelling adventure with Ecoquest Tours (ranked #1 excursion in San Juan), the bioluminescent bay in Fajardo (these are both physically demanding so make sure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re up for the challenge, but they will be the highlight of your trip if you can make it), and spend at least one morning/afternoon walking the streets of old San Juan As for the common negative reviews I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen on Tripadvisor, some are true but I feel overstated. The main one I see is the airport noise. The resort area of San Juan where the Ritz is located is near the airport, but so is every other hotel in this area (i.e. Waldorf, Intercontinental, Marriot, Embassy Suites), and you can hear the airplanes from all of them. That stated, the airplanes are not so loud that they affect your relaxation, and are unnoticeable once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re inside. The other main complaint I see is the staff, which I will just have to differ with. We were asked about every 10 minutes whether we needed anything while we were pool/beach side, unless we were napping or had recently received a beverage/food. The concierge, casino staff, spa staff, and cleaning staff were great as well. The only negative I can recognize is the price of food and drinks pool/beach side ($14 burgers and $5 beers). However, the food at the other restaurants seemed comparable to what I see at any nice restaurant. If you want more of a selection, try old San Juan. Or, you can go to Pueblo (the local grocery store), and stock up on beer, wine, and snacks on your 1st day and save a bundle. Finally, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll admit that we stayed at the Ritz on a professional discount, and perhaps that has slightly affected my positive recommendation. However, I must say that I think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve accurately represented the stay you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find at the Ritz.

The large marble bathroom and comfy bed with delicious linens make this a very comfortable room. We rented two movies and the picture quality was blurry and second rate. The TV is a seemingly new flat screen, so I am not sure why the picture quality was degraded. We ordered basic food from room service: 1 burger, 1 ceasar salad, 1 cheese cake, 1 glass wine, 1 small ice cream. The burger was fine, but the ceasar salad was a wedge of romaine topped with a glob of creamy italian dressing (not real ceasar dressing), and thus was disappointing to me. The cheesecake was flavorless and tasted like it was made from soy cream cheese. The room service bill was $100. I would recommend eating in San Juan, but we were just too tired to budge after traveling from Vieques that morning. The pool was not as clean as I had hoped-- with my goggles I could unfortunately see clumps of hair, wads of gum, dead bugs and other detritus on the bottom. But, It was the end of the day when I got there and also quite crowded that day -- I imagine they clean it at night. The pool is also very shallow throughout, bath water warm and lacks a lap lane. This was disappointing to me as well, however, my young son loved the warm shallow water, and copious floating water mattresses. The beach was nice enough, warm cerulean water, nice clean sand. I heard there is snorkeling but the day I was there was quite windy, and as a result the tides were high and there was a wicked undertow and no visibility due to sand. It was perfect for a dip though, and there were ample chaise lounges on the beach if I were the tanning sort. There are more beautiful beaches farther east, but for a hotel so close to San Juan and the airport, the beach was perfect. As everyone has stated, the service is impeccable and the surroundings are well groomed. Also when I checked in, I received a free necklace as a gift from the jewelry store, which was an unexpected surprise. It looks to be silver plate but it is still a nice memento of the trip. The Ritz compares favorably to the Caribe Hilton just down the road a ways, where we spent the first night of our trip. The Hilton had a smaller pool, a dirtier stretch of beach, and the rooms were not as nice. The Hilton was a tad cheaper, and overall was nice enough but the RItz is a cut above. Next time I will stay at the Ritz on the first and last nights due to its proximity to the airport. With regard to that, you can hear the planes from the beach but not from the pool or the room.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cPleased\u201d", "Author": "ams779", "ReviewID": "UR67026222", "Content": "My boyfriend and I just returned from 5 days at the Ritz in San Juan. We decided on this hotel after reading reviews on tripadvisor and discovering that this was one of the only hotels without glaring negative comments. We found the same. It was very pleasant, clean, and the service was top notch. The beach was clean, white sand with no rocks. There were ample towels, beach chairs and umbrellas for all. The pool was also lovely, but there were lots of kids making noise during the prime times. Be aware that there is a \"resort fee\" per day which was extra added to out bill at the end of our stay. It turned out to be about $70 for 5 days. We booked on orbitz and it probably was written somewhere, but we were taken by surprise. This fee included use of the sauna and hot tub in the spa and exercise classes and gym. The restaurants in the ritz are very expensive. We paid $16 for 2 bagels and 2 coffees which we took to go. I guess that is to be expected at the Ritz. There are lots of chain restaurants in walking distance and a starbucks in the hotel next door. We felt safe walking on the streets surrounding the hotel even at night. We actually parked our rental car on the street to avoid the $17parking fee at the hotel. We ended up going to El San Juan hotel next door alot, it seemed a bit younger and more fun. We found that it was more affordable to rent a car than take cabs from the Ritz. A cab ride to old san juan was $21 one way. We rented a car at the enterprise in the hotel for $25. Everyone who worked for enterprise were great and very easy to deal with. I am happy that we stayed at the Ritz our first time in San Juan. The service there can't be beat. The concierge was excellent and we received printed door to door driving directions and information for everything we wanted to see.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luverne, MN", "Title": "\u201cService & Staff Friendliness Top Notch - Expensive But Worth It\u201d", "Author": "Weather_Guru", "ReviewID": "UR67005065", "Content": "I booked a brief getaway (4 nights) for my wife and I having never been to Puerto Rico, but hearing good things about this property and the beach. It was a very good decision. We went on the expectations that we were going to just stay at the property, relax, lay in the sun, and not do much else. Immediately, one benefit is that this property is located right off the airport so the taxi ride took about 5 min. We were immediately greeted by superb and friendly valet staff and a front desk person who was also friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. We chose the city view room because of expense and it was basically a view of the property next door so nothing spectacular. The bed was soft and very comfortable although my wife had some back issues because of the softness of the bed. The room was very clean as was the bathroom. The bathroom had marble and a separate room for the toilet. The room is supplied with coffee and tea which I enjoy and utilized. It is also supplied with a fridge/bar containing items I've never seen before including an abundance of nuts, candies, soda, alcohol, etc. Prices were spendy, but it was nice to have in case you were hungry or thirsty. We utilized Room Service twice and it was one of the best in-room dining that I've eaten. The food took about 30 - 45 min to be delivered and it was delivered by continued top-notch staff who were friendly and would answer any questions you had. The food was also great. I guess we don't normally expect that much from in-room dining, but the food was good and they had a great selection. Again, like everything else at the Ritz-Carlton, it is expensive and I'm sure for the both of us we spent $75 - $100 each time. The property is beautiful. Flowers and green foliage everywhere. The grounds are kept up well. The pool area is very large clean. There are a large number of loungers although it can still be difficult to find an empty one at the height of the day. We were worried about the temperature with June being in the low to mid 90s and dew points in the middle 70s. These are stifling conditions for a Minnesotan, but we were pleasantly surprised that the constant breeze made it feel very pleasant. The beach is well kept and wonderful to lay out on. The staff will eagerly assist you with towels, setting up your lounger, and putting an umbrella up for you. There is plenty of space on which to lay around and you can even find good spots under palm trees for some shade or choose that umbrella to cool off under. Staff, from the beach-side restaurant, frequently make trips out to see if you need any drink or food. The ocean water is bath-water warm which I think is great. I love getting in warm water so it was a wonderful ocean experience. The waves were not high at all so it was fairly calm the entire time. Weather conditions were pleasant most of the time with an occasional rain shower here and there. It had been rainy the week prior and I guess it can be rainy at times, but who can control the weather? My wife made use of the spa for 2 massages. She had a standard massage and came back saying it was the best massage she has had in her life. I think that was until she had her 2nd massage (a Reflexology massage) which she claimed was even better. She told me that the staff were absolutely wonderful and pampered her in every way possible. Again, be prepared to pay at least $150 per massage which is not that outrageous since it seems like most resorts charge this amount. My wife said it was worth every penny! We utilized all restaurants on the property and really did not have any bad experiences. The BLT Steak place had good food and good service. We spent a little over $100 for the both of us. The Italian restaurant, on the other hand, was by far some of the best Italian food I have ever eaten. It is pretty fancy and felt a little stuffy, but after eating the food it was worth it. The staff are attending to you practically every second. We did have one staff member who made a slightly rude comment, but all of the other staff were superior in every way and friendly just like all of the staff at the Ritz-Carlton. My wife had mushroom stuffed ravioli in a truffle sauce that I regretted not ordering! Be prepared to really fork it out here. Prices for both of us with tips and everything ranked above $150. That did not include any wine. The beach side restaurant had good food with a basic \"beach-side\" menu. We enjoyed having something light for lunch here and watching the ocean. Overall, I have to say that the service was the best I've ever seen. I've never stayed in a Ritz-Carlton before, but it was definitely worth splurging and paying extra for all involved.

The pool was great and there is more than one and the beach was great also. Great fitness center The rooms were cool and I thought the beds were actually very comfortable with great down comforters. The air worked well and I never heard it at all. The shower pressure was very good and the bathrooms were fine. There was also a lot of closet space. The restaurants at the hotel are kind of pricey but we found ways around that as places like Palm (an expensive restaurant) had a happy hour from 4-7 with $3.50 appetizers. We ordered like 10 appetizers and were straight for dinner. The only downside that I can think of was how hard it was to find a bell hop. It took them over 40 minutes to come when we called down stairs to check out and no one brought our stuff upstairs. That sucked. Also, our last night we were fortunate enough to be a few rooms down from a room full of fraternity members who stayed up until well after 4:00am expressing themselves in the hallway.

No, the rooms were not as big as other RCs, and the bathroom was a little smaller; but it was still very nice, quiet (we never heard our neighbors, and the hotel was at full capacity for half of our stay) clean (there was no mildew smell as in other four-star hotels just down the street), and comfortable (we all slept so well). The fitness center was great, loved the free wi-fi (other RCs charge for this), the casion seemed nice and clean (we don't gamble, but when we walked through it to find an ATM, we saw that it was very clean, staff was friendly), and the onsite dining was phenomenal -- especially BLT and Il Mulino. We liked the location -- five minutes from the airport is super convenient, especially when you have to be at the airport by 10:30 a.m. It's nice to get up, grab breakfast and pack without feeling rushed. And during the eight days we were there, we only heard about half a dozen planes take off -- and only when we were outside. Also, we discovered some restaurants nearby that allowed us to just grab quick/casual bites -- Starbucks, Metropol for dinner, Pui Bello and Dennys for breakfast... Price -- I am puzzled by the negative reviews related to the cost -- what do you expect? It's the Ritz, not the Hampton Inn (which, by the way, I think is a great hotel chain -- and there is an HI right across the street -- but please, don't expect HI prices at the RC). We spent what we thought we would spend for each day. And the hotel does offer \"happy hour\" specials -- lobby lounge had 2-for-1 drink specials; BLT (awesome) had a great price-fixed menu and half-priced bottles of wine from 6-7 p.m. But still, it wasn't \"cheap.\" Yet we do feel like we got what we paid for. Service - yeah, this was the hotel's downfall. The last night of our stay, we waited 40 minutes for a waiter to get our drink order in the lobby lounge -- and they never actually took the order. I had to approach the bartender twice, and he had a really bad attitude. The manager promised our drinks would come -- but they never did. It was pretty bizarre.

The grounds are lovely but I did notice alot of wear in our room - something you would not expect at a Ritz. Some of these things may seem trivial to some - such as stains on the carpets, shabby towels, mildew in the shower, but when you pay this type of money, your expectations are high. Another disappointing factor for us was that this is a VERY FAMILY FRIENDLY RESORT! The place was PACKED with children, which could have been expected considering we arrived the Friday before Easter and kids were out on Spring Break. We did not even attempt to find a chair at the pool or even go into the pool since it was invaded by children having fun (just not our thing for a \"relaxing vacation\"). By the way, one of the children had an accident in the pool and the pool needed to be closed for hours on one the days we were there. No fault of the hotel of course, but it still happened. Another thing I noticed at this hotel was that NOT ONE of the hotel employees responded with \"My Pleasure\". We heard it often from the servers at the independent restaurants within the hotel but not Ritz employees, One night we came back to the hotel and the door man did not even hold the door open for me. Again, something you expect from a Ritz, but this location simply did not deliver on the Ritz reputation to the fullest. My complaints are only that this location did fall short on what you expect from a Ritz, but it still is a lovely hotel. We did spend most of our time on the property and enjoyed the food. Pricey, but it is the Ritz and we expected that. One night we had dinner at La Piccola Fontana in the El San Juan Hotel, one night we had dinner at BLT and one night we had dinner at Il Mulino, both in the Ritz. Il Mulino was very expensive but we were in heaven within minutes after sitting with the anti-pasto selections that were immediately placed on our table. The entire experience was pleasant to say the least. The final night we had dinner in Old San Juan at a place we stumbled upon. This was the best day of our trip - walking around in Old San Juan and having dinner at La Cucina di Ivo, a gem of an Italian restaurant. There was outside seating, but lovely inside seating as well. I literally lost myself and felt as though we were in Rome. The gnocchi's are homemade and this was the best meal for us during our stay - and the cheapest too. The restaurant was just behind Harry Winston's which our stop in this store was just a fantasy shopping experience :) All in all, we did enjoy our stay even though this location does fall a tad short on what you can expect from a Ritz.

We went there on Friday and Saturday night and it was so great for people watching. It was so crazy over there, the lobby bars were packed, it was very loud. Everyone of all ages were so drunk we saw 70 year old's that couldn't walk at 10pm they were so hammered. We also went to the dance club on Saturday night. It was ok, nothing special. It wasn't very clean at the hotel though, the bathrooms were dirty. We were happy we were staying at the Ritz, we went back there and laughed the 2 places were like night and day. The Ritz is very small and intimate, it's the perfect place to relax if what your into is beach/ pool/ drinks/ dinner/ and the same the next day. If you want more than that it's probably not the place for you. Wed did go to the casino for a little bit every night and noticed that the only people in the casino were the locals. I lost every time on slots, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see one person winning anything. My husband played in one of the nightly poker tournaments and after about 6 hours of playing won $150 in 5th place. He felt it was a waste of time since it took so long so never played again. Again, it was all locals playing. He felt out of the loop cause they were all speaking Spanish the entire time and he had no idea where they were saying. It rained a couple of days when we were there so there was nothing to do at the hotel, we asked the guys outside where to go. Anywhere you want to cab it is pretty much $15 or $20 each way. One day we went down to Old San Juan to the shops and walked there for a few hours. If you want to get souvenirs then this is the place to go. Then went to the mall later on, just like any other mall near you, nothing special. The next day we went down to Ashford Avenue- they say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like their Rodeo Drive but we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very impressed. They could make it really nice if it gets built up. We did see the La Concha hotel which looked nice, we walked around in there to dry off since it was raining. Other than that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us anything else to do so hopefully it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rain when you go there. Lol. We were hoping to just spend the whole trip at the beach but that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible for us. We had the club level which had food out for breakfast, lunch and dinner and you could also go in there for drinks at anytime, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it enough for it to be worth it for us. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to go there to eat then it might be worthwhile for you. We saw what they had at dinner time and it was nothing of interest to us. We ate breakfast at the hotel 2 mornings and both times it cost us close to $100 (for 2 of us) The food was excellent. We spend about $200 at the beach on food and drinks the days we were out there. That was just my husband drinking beer (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pregnant and drank seltzer) At the beach bar it was around $18 a hamburger and fries. Everything we ate there was very good. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 5 star hotel and we expected it to be expensive and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about it, but if you want to save money there were restaurants close by. Not sure how they were but the prices looked reasonable when we walked by. We ran into a couple from Alabama and they told us they ate at the restaurant on the beach right next to our hotel and he said that he had the best burger he ever had in his life. Overall, we had a great vacation at the Ritz, we immediately felt comfortable and like we could relax upon arriving and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to leave. We stayed 5 days and wished we had longer. All the staff we dealt with were great.

The upgrade was expensive, as was the resort fee added on. I love not being bothered with extra fees like wireless, but the resort fee is quite high regardless. We took the club level so we only had to deal with dinner. I thought the club floor more than paid for itself. The restaurants in the hotel are outrageously expensive. Whether you can afford it or not, come on! Once we settled in, the pool and beach couldn't have been any nicer. The staff was attentive but not intrusive.

Wanted to escape NYC for somewhere guaranteed to be warm so we could just relax and unwind. Chose San Juan because it's an easy, direct flight. Once we made the reservations, I discovered several friends who had been to this hotel and really enjoyed it. Let me start by saying that, overall, it was an okay stay. Would I go back? No. Why? I think you can do much better for the money...let me explain. A previous poster mentioned how close it was to the airport. That is absolutely true. Rooms in the front of the hotel overlook the airport runways. You do hear the thunderous roar of airplanes coming and going the entire time you are lounging at the pool or the beach. Side note: the cab driver overcharged us by $5...just FYI, confirm that it is a $10 fare plus a $1/bag charge before they start to drive. It's literally a five minute cab ride. We arrived at 1 a.m., so we probably didn't get the typical first impression of a Ritz Carlton guest. We dragged in our own bags, front desk guy was nice and efficient, but we had to confirm specifics of our check in...he didn't offer them. The offer to help take our bags up to the room was more of a hesitant, please-don't-say-yes question. Got the feeling they were operating with a very lean staff at that hour. While the lobby was quite elegant and classy, once stepping off the elevator on our floor it was clear that the hotel was quite old, and possibly refurbished from something that was not a Ritz Carlton before. It was clean and well-cared for, but worn doorways showed clear signs of age. We had reserved a club-level, ocean view balcony room and were quite surprised by how unimpressive the room was. It had all the standard appointments, but it was rather small, very little closet space (we had trouble fitting our suitcases in the closet), and the bathroom was nothing remarkable (one sink, shower/tub combo...did have a water closet, though). Our room clearly had some of the best views in the place, but we still overlooked unattractive rooftops of the buildings and apartments to the west. We had great views of the pool and beach, but the beach was quite far from our room. The only other rooms with balconies had a decent view of the beach, but no real views of the pool...instead they overlook the basketball court/wedding gazebo. We popped up the first morning to spend the day at the pool and were surprised by how hard it was to find two decent lounge chairs together. Obviously, even though the pool area was jam-packed with lounge chairs, people had come down early to reserve seats (and frustratingly enough, we observed that many of the \"reserved\" chairs went unused over the course of the day). We ended up stuck by the beachside restaurant that day and were subjected to the not-so-great music coming from the bar and a steady stream of traffic (made up of waitstaff, guests going back and forth the bathroom, landscapers, etc.). It was hardly private or relaxing, but we learned our lesson and went down to reserve chairs at 7 a.m. the rest of our stay. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. (Note: shame on Ritz Carlton for maintaining such a large, private cabana area in a prime location. We looked into reserving those, were told they were booked for the entire weekend, and saw that they were more than 75% empty the whole weekend. You really should have plenty of comfortable seating for your paying guests.) Somewhat surprising was the fact that the Ritz sits on a postage stamp-size property on a public beach. We preferred to hang by the pool during the day, but we were disappointed that walking the beach in the daytime or evenings was not appealing. Neighbors of the Ritz Carlton include: a rundown sports club, an unattractive condo building (which rooms on the east side of the building overlook), a Marriott Courtyard (which looked quite decent and appeared to have better ocean views than we had!), etc. Also disappointing, because of the way the beach is shaped and the height of the buildings to the west, we didn't get to see one sunset while we were there (even from the 9th floor balcony). Such a shame...I'm sure they were lovely. I could easily get bogged down with other details about the pluses and minues, but I'll do my best to sum up here. Pluses: - The people were very friendly...we generally had great service from genuinely great and helpful staff. - We had some EXCELLENT meals. Mares serves a great brunch and has a very nice lunch menu. BLT Steak and Il Mulino, while very pricey, were outstanding. In four days, we only left the property for one meal away, and I wouldn't have changed that. - The atmosphere was surprisingly casual. I had been warned that dress codes were strict at the restaurants, but was disappointed that we had gotten so dressed up when others showed up in jeans. Minuses: - Property and room were rather disappointing. Housekeeping missed a few beats by not removing empty glasses (to the point of absurdity...like 10 over two days!) and not properly stocking our towels (we only had a bath mat two of the four days). Also had a bizarre situation where a bottle of wine was errantly delivered to our room. We unknowingly tipped the guy who delivered it, only to find out it was sent to the wrong room after he had walked away. We notified the front desk, and they took the bottle from our room during turndown service without leaving a substitute or just telling us to keep it. We were out the $10 tip for that one...kind of strange. - The proximity to the airport was pretty annoying. - Beach was nothing special. Hard to walk and crowded with local surfers. - Club level lounge had a pretty lame breakfast spread and the lounge itself was small and dark. It didn't compare to other Ritz Carlton lounges we've had the pleasure of visiting in the past. - We were shocked by all the families. Could have been the time of year we were there, but we had a couple of instances were children were very disruptive during our meals. Frustrating that parents don't consider other diners when their children are running laps around the tables and bouncing on seats. I'd expect that at a hotel near Disney World, but not here. Conclusion Overall, we had a pleasant but unremarkable stay. We were hoping to come across a place that could be a regular long-weekend getaway for some late-winter R&R...but this was NOT the place. We kept saying to each other that while there were things that were very easy to nit-pick, the biggest problem was that we could have gotten A LOT more for our money somewhere else. Had we stayed in one of the less expensive rooms or gotten a great deal, perhaps we'd have felt differently. But for $900 a night (after tax and resort fees), I would hope for more...MUCH more.

I was largely disappointed. The hotel itself is nice enough but the rooms are in need of a renovation. My room was a good size, had a minimal ocean view, the pool blocked by large palm trees (on the 6th floor). The carpet in the room had several dark stains. The bathroom sink area was streaked with (I presume) other peoples' makeup -- it came off on a kleenex-yuk. The hairdryer was so dirty I didn't use it. Housekeeping was problematic -- rooms made up late -- one day after 3:30PM and early \"turndown\" between 5:30-6PM except one night when they came after 9! One time they took my used towels but did not replace them. My hotel directory was missing several pages including most of the room service menu. Are all of these horror stories -- not really but when you're paying in excess of $500/night plus resort fees and it's the RITZ, you expect a little more. The staff were all cordial and enthusiastic and the internet access was excellent -- a real plus for me. The grounds are small -- a nice (but not spectacular) pool area and that's about it. The beach area is public and you are warned that you are leaving hotel property. I\"m not a fan of Isla Verde -- the section where the hotel is located -- because there's nothing much to see or do. Old San Juan and the Condado are (an expensive) cab ride away. Shopping in the hotel consists of two jewelry stores and a vastly overpriced logo shop. No toiletries, soda, water, etc anywhere. You need to venture out to Walgreens for that. I ate twice in the BLT STeakhouse. It was quite good and the service excellent. On my last day I had lunch in Mares -- I opted to pay with a credit card so my room bill would remain closed out. Well, they charged my credit card and then at check out was told that my room was charged also. To boot, it wasn't even MY bill charged to the room. No one seemed to be able to sort it out in a timely fashion and I needed to leave for my flight. They took off the charge but still need to \"investigate\". The conference facilities were very good but they seemed to have difficulties with our continental breakfast each morning. Couldn't make two toasters for bagels work at the same time and they kept shorting out. THIS IS THE RITZ. The upshot -- I felt the hotel was below Ritz standards -- and I've stayed at a few -- and I was frustrated enough with the unevenness of service that I probably would not stay again even if my (yearly) conference is there next year.

Service was great but we found people all over the island to be extremely friendly.

The bar does have drink specials that you can and should take advantage of...what's the point of coming to the islands if you're not going to knock back a little Rum? The biggest down side to the hotel is that it's a 20 minutes drive ($20 cab ride) into SJ...on the other hand, it's beach front with a private beach and there is absolutely nothing of comparable quality in SJ itself...we checked out El Convento, one of the only other 5 star properties actually in the city, and it was nothing compared to the Ritz in terms of service or aesthetics. Personally, I thought that Il Mulino was overrated but BLT was just as good there as it is anywhere else. Another hiccup is that the walls are very thin. We had what sounded like a colicky baby in the room next to us who occasionally disturbed our peace but the walls were so thin that you could hear phones ringing...if you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs!

Anyone who says that their customer service is lacking either had a one-off bad experience or is just a difficult and demanding customer. Just one example of their service: we went into Old SJ one night to meet with a friend who lives there and upon giving the address of our destination to the bell hop (who we had befriended over the course of the stay), he proceeded to have a 5 minute conversation with the cabbie about how he wasn't to leave us anywhere that didn't look above board (we were two women traveling alone) and that he was to stay until we went in to make sure that nothing was amiss...true to his word, the cabbie did stay with us because as it turned out, we were a little early and our friend wasn't home yet.

I wheezed ,sneezed and was most displeased 2/17 thru 2/21 . This is not A Ritz!. I have stayed at Ritz Carltons in Orlando and San Francisco. Marriott needs to send these folks to Hotel School. Hospitality means service Not just say I'm sorry and do nothing to fix the problem. The grounds and the physical property are very nice but the hugh markup for food and drink is unwarranted.

Yes it always takes some time at check-in before your room is ready; we bring a carry on with a change of clothes and use the spa to change clothes. This is the best resort in San Juan, others do not come close. We tried a few and were disappointed. We always stay on the club floor and it feels like home when we arrive. The club staff is always there to take care of your needs. We have breakfast and lunch on the club and usually grab a cocktail before heading out for dinner. Many people eat all meals and desserts on the club as well. We ate at IL Mulino twice this year and the service and quality of food is fantastic. We had Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dinner there and it was awesome. Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris steakhouse is nearby at the intercontinental and Morton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a short taxi ride at the Hilton. There are many excellent restaurants in Old San Juan as well. We usually spend one afternoon shopping (Coach, Polo, Guess, Burberry and many more). I would rather use the beach instead and just relax. San Juan has a feeling of being in a city with a tropical feel; you have to know this before going. Many people are disappointed about all the buildings, the airport etc. We like looking at the planes taking off while you are swimming in the ocean, others complain about the noise. The resort has a city feel as well, many of the rooms do not have balconies. The rooms are very clean (never had a bad experience) and the cleaning staff is great. Call them when you check-in a let them know what time you want your room cleaned and turned down, they will accommodate all requests. Keep an open mind as well, many guests think that just because they are staying at a Ritz Carlton that they should be treated like royalty. Be prepared to spend money, nothing good is cheap. If paying $20 for a burger is not your thing, then don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come here! My recommendations: If you can stay on the Club level (Worth it!) and take advantage of all it has to offer, it will save your money in the long run. Tip the Club staff; they go beyond the normal level of service. Have dinner at Il Mulino. The quality and service are great. The Ritz does make you feel special and that is what vacations are all about.

I am in the process of writing to the corporate headquarters and the hotel GM to express my indignation.

I know this hotel is quite expensive, but hard for me to give exact details as my pricing was part of a larger package that included things outside of hotel (dinners,transportation,tours) so it is hard to give an exact detail on price. Hotel is very close to airport, which is a good and bad thing. It is in a bit of a noisy area, planes going overhead, and also outside the hotel at the street. The neighborhood around the hotel is not really a touristy area per se, but there are a lot of options for food and drink in walking distance. While the area around hotel was not luxury, I still think it was pretty safe and many people, both guests and residents walking around, even at night. Several restuarants around, including fast food joints, as well as small strip malls, with drug stores like Walgreens - purchase snacks or other items outside hotel gift shop. The hotel was very nice. Lobby was nice, including a seating area with a small bar. Several nice, but expensive hotels in the hotel. We ate at the breakfast buffet several times, and ate at the il Mulino restaurant in hotel. The food at il Mulino is very good, they have several locations around the world, including NYC. The casino was a nice size, with a decent crowd and choice of games. Pool was very nice, beach was nothing special. Service was so so. Getting drinks at pool took a while and the cost was siginifcant. Pool attendents set up chairs, umbrella and towels for you, but expected a tip. Chairs were nice and padded, but were often wet due to rain or people sitting on with wet clothes. I found this annoying, even when extra towels were placed on chairs they eventually soaked through. Food is expensive. Had a cheeseburger by the pool for lunch one day and I believe it cost something like $18. It was a regular burger, not kobe or angus beef, and the service by pool side restuarant was not great. After that day, we realized to eat out away from the hotel, for much more reasonable and better quality food for lunch. Our group also had an issue with the hospitality suite we were assigned. Even though we brought our own food and snacks for the group (as we were told), the Ritz charged crazy fees for ice, glasses and cleanup that made it almost not worth using.

To address the comment made by another writer about the 7th floor having bed bugs - we stayed on the 7th floor and were just fine. However, we hadn't read that review before we came and then other guests told us about it - about the review and that they had been on that floor and their room smelled funky like bug spray. We were quite alarmed upon hearing it, and at first the staff at the Ritz did/said little to appease our concerns and also could not switch our room b/c the hotel was full. The next morning, however, Ramon promptly told us that the hotel (and all hotels) are frequently checked for bed bugs and insects and that there are none, but rather, people can be bitten by sand fleas. Still, he had an exterminator come to make absolutely sure. We appreciated this measure. The good -The pool area was nice. You can have an umbrella if you like. Waiter/waitress service at the pool, though slow at times and you need to flag them down. -The spa was very nice. I had an amazing massage. -The concierge was helpful with dinner suggestions and providing menus. -The bellmen were very nice, especially Carlos. -Many people seem to love the restaurants at the hotel. I can't speak to them, as we went into Old San Juan every night for dinner. -Some people don't like the location, but I understood where the hotel was located when I booked, and it was quite good for us. We really liked being so close to the airport, and we rarely heard planes overhead. The bad -Our key cards kept not working when we went up to the room. This was an annoyance b/c then we would have to go downstairs and have the cards redone. This happened three times. Ramon was apologetic about this and said that they are fixing this hotel-wide problem. -The pool area staff are not that attentive. And, at times, the pool area is dirty with people's food or drink glasses from hours earlier. -Housekeeping kept giving us one or two towels only and no washcloths. They also did not give us additional shampoo and conditioner, when it was clear we had used up what they had given us and did not refill the coffee, which is in the room with a coffee maker. Every day we had to call housekeeping for one or more of these items. -I was told when I booked that the Ritz beach was a private beach. This is not the case; all beaches in San Juan are public.

The staff is very unhelpful and is always looking to make a buck off of you. For example, a simple activity of sitting by the pool turns into a shakedown for a $70 cabana. Another example-I was told that I could check out at 1pm (regular check out is noon. this service is often complimentary at an establishment such as this). Nobody mentions that I'd get charged $250 for this service! Apparently late check out incurs a charge between half and full room rate. 3.

The setting is gorgeous. The hotel was spotless and for a change everything worked in our two rooms. Walking into the lobby through the front door was breath taking each time. New Years Eve at the small restaurant beach side was memorable. The food, drink, and music was great. The fireworks on the beach was an unexpected plus. The lobby bar occupies a large part of the lobby. It was often filled with happy people chatting, eating and drinking. The location in Isla Verde is very good. Now for the bad news. One of our two original rooms faced the side of the Club balcony about 20 feet away. Within the first few hours I had people looking in my window. I requested a change from the Club concierge with no result so I presented myself at the front desk, told them what room I was in and they knew immediately what the problem was and moved us to a far better room. I have a good idea... how about not trying to stick someone staying for a week in that crappy room. Getting a beach chair or pool chair and umbrella required rising early and getting downstairs to lay claim to a spot not later than 8 AM. Getting the beach staff to help set up required more patience than should be expected from people paying top dollar at this hotel. They were understaffed and under supplied with chairs and umbrellas. After a couple of days of this nonsense, I started taking the chairs off the pile myself and setting it up. Housekeeping couldn't quite remember to leave us a bath mat and shampoo. The two chain restaurants located at the hotel appear to not understand that guests of the hotel should get first priority in seating. At BLT we were refused reservations at 7 PM and told there was nothing available except 6 PM and 9:30 PM. We finally got a 6:30 slot after the Club concierge called and made a fuss.

It was so much fun for all of us!", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Property, Staff Needs Customer Service Refresher\u201d", "Author": "GeekVeep", "ReviewID": "UR51668376", "Content": "First, let me say that this was my first trip to PR and I didn't like it, but I will try not to let my bias about the city of San Juan itself cloud my review of this specific property. We arrive in about 15 very short, easy minutes from the airport. This is a big plus if you are going on a trip and don't want to spend 2 days traveling. Get a direct flight and SJ can be almost as easy as driving to the beach. But with this proximity to the airport, you can hear the planes taking off and landing, but only from the outside of the resort. I never heard any airport noise in my room. On the beach, the planes take off approximately every 30 minutes. It's noisy, but since the beach in SJ has waves crashing, it really isn't annoying like it would be if you were on a quiet tropical beach with no waves. The beach is beautiful, but not a tropical beach as I expected. Shame on me for not doing more research on this part of PR because the beach was more like Jersey than the Caribbean. I understand that other beaches on the island on the south, west, and east sides are much better, but this one is on the Atlantic Ocean, so don't expect the calm, clear blue tropical waters of the Caribbean. Prior to going, I read complaints about getting service on the beach for drinks and that the drinks were crazy expensive. The drinks are crazy expensive, but it's the Ritz. If you are expecting bargains, DO NOT come to this resort! We got services just fine, but we made a point to introduce ourselves to the servers each morning, slip them a $20 and then ask them to come back every 30-45 minutes. We also tipped well with each round and service was never a problem. The pool is beautiful, but overrun with kids. This is definitely a family resort so if you are annoyed with screaming kids (even in the upscale restaurants!), you will be unhappy here. I do think that for the prices that are charged, there should be some NON-family friendly areas of the resort and restaurants (other than the casino) where business people or folks traveling without children can relax. We rented a cabana at the pool one day and it was a good deal, however we were very disappointed that we ended up beside a family with about 6 kids under the age of 10 and were unable to work. We asked for a cabana at the far end and were accommodated right away; however, if this had been a busy time at the resort, we would have been stuck beside them. The rooms are beautiful, room service was expensive but good, and the maid staff did a nice job. The staff, in general, are not over friendly. We were told that the PR folks are not as friendly as other islands; that they tend to be aloof and that we shouldn't take it personally. I have to say that when I'm staying at a hotel of the magnitude of the Ritz, I do not expect aloof service, no matter what the local culture may be. I expect far better from the Ritz and am sad to say that aside from a few servers or doormen, the vast majority of the staff at the Ritz and business folks around SJ are just not very friendly no matter how hard one tries. This reason, and the SJ beach being on the Atlantic are why I won't be going back to SJ unless I absolutely have to. I'm willing to try another area of the island, though. Fortunately, I had gotten a killer deal on the Ritz and that was why we were there. If I had paid full price, I would have been furious. I understand that there is a \"Club Level\" on the 8th or 9th floor, where breakfast and lunch and some drinks and snacks are included. Several folks we met were on this program and felt it was a great deal. Be sure to ask about it to see if it might save you money. As a point of reference, our breakfast at the Ritz each morning for 3 of us was $77 including tip, so judge for yourself about how much it costs to eat on property. Again, I can't stress enough; it's the Ritz and the prices are crazy expensive, so don't go if this will cause you stress during your stay.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellevue, WA", "Title": "\u201cTotally relaxing time and experiece\u201d", "Author": "sxs317", "ReviewID": "UR51528962", "Content": "My family (wife and young son) had a short break so we decided that it was time to get out of the freezing cold of PA and take a relaxing vacation. We picked Puerto Rico because of a sweet deal from Costco travel of on free night stay at the Ritz Carlton San Juan so it ended up being a better deal for a little more than the Expedia deals. Let me just say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we stayed at the Ritz. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed at a Ritz before an so far no other hotels have beaten the quality of stays we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been at before. Granted we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stayed at hotel chains such as the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s but we have stayed at Fairmont hotels and Westin hotels and the Wynn hotel in Las Vegas. We stayed a total of 4 nights and it was a great experience. Maybe because we had a newborn, but this trip was definitely more gratifying for me than past beach vacations. Hotel: In my opinion this is probably the best place to stay in San Juan, both from perspective and from what we have been told and the fact that we did see other hotels which I will explain later why. The pool is gorgeous and relaxing and right next to the beach. The great thing about the Ritz is that you do pay a resort fee but it covers towels, chairs and about anything you need when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there. That is totally a convenience especially since we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to other hotels where you need a sign-out sheet, or pay per hour for use of chairs. That IMO just ruins the experience. With the Ritz you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about any of these things. Room The room was an average sized room with a king sized bed. The Ritz surprisingly is quite family friendly in that they provided a crib at no extra charge. Another note with Ritz service is that if you need anything they make sure you get it as soon as possible and they have just about everything you need. They even had pack and plays for the pool. The bathroom was very nice with Bvulgari brand shampoo and soap, plenty of towels, a flat screen tv and feather bed and down comforters. High speed internet LAN and wireless are included. Our view was terrible and they wanted to charge us $70/night extra for an oceanview but that was expected since we got a package deal. Pool The pool and beach we excellent although we stayed by the pool most of the time. Service was good and there were plenty of other families. There are always snooty old couples though that get annoyed when your baby cries but who cares, you paid for the place too. Food by the pool is expected to be expensive but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at the ritz. $12 for a mixed drink, I drank a lot of Coronas at $7 a pop, but it was SOOO good in the nice weather. Slighty windy when we were there but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care. Location This was key for the hotel in that it was only 5-10 minutes away from the airport. The costco package was great in that we had a personal driver that picked us up from and took us too the airport included in the package. That was definitely a bonus\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a first for us too! We were picked up in an Escalade and they provided a car sear for us!! There is a Walgreens like 5 minutes walk we were able to pick up stuff for the baby and drinks and snacks since we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to spend so much on soda at the hotel. Restaurants: There are three main restaurants there, Il Mulino, BLT steakhouse, and OBG. The mares restaurants is the hotel breakfast restaurant. We tried all of them. We are all about food, so we like the food selections at the Ritz a lot. OBG The first night there we went to OBG for the sushi in which it seemed they were heavily advertising \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first female sushi chef in Puerto Rico,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and is sounded like it should be good. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it, probably really over rated, the sushi was just par and very little selection. It was basically the beach side restaurant that served sushi. OBG is the same restaurant that serves the pool , the food was just ok and overpriced, but what do you expect. We go nachos one day, and the chicken sandwich and the salmon wrap by the pool. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you should expect gourmet cuisine by the pool and we tend to expect overpriced mediocore food by the pool so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really complain about it. But\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re budget conscious then pool food is not the way to go. BLT We went to BLT TWICE, just because we like steak and wine so much. We saw a couple get the porterhouse for two and it looked so good we wanted to try it. BLT was nice in that from 6-7 PM they offered half price all wines, which is another reason we went there again. They had a nice selection of wine and both nights the wine was good. The steak is on the level of Morton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, they overcooked our Porterhouse on the second night (and we specifically emphasized to keep it rare) but we were enjoying the evening too much to even care. Service was excellent and the coconut bread pudding was great. Il Mulino Il mulino apparently is a restaurant from New York that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to get reservations at so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we were able to try it in Puerto Rico. That restaurant was an EXCELLENT experience. Service was great, it is basically upscale Italian cuisine, but it was great. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pricey, as are all the restaurants at the ritz but you never felt like you were over paying because they give you so much extra! If you ever ate Tappas\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the opposite of that feeling, ie tappas you pay an arm and a leg and get as little food as possible. Il Mulino started us with antipasti that was delicious and aged parmesian cheese. They a huge variety of breads and tasty garlic bread. The wine was very expensive so the wines by the glass sufficed. The menu has a huge selection but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure all the dishes are good. They have an extensive specials menu also. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure what dessert to get but ended up with the Tiramsu, but the gave is a sample of the other dessert complimentary!! They also bring you a nice liquor after your dessert complimentary. In short if I were to go again I would have eaten at Il Mulino twice, excellent service, food and experience! The price was about average too for a nice meal like that, we were highly impressed. Lobby Bar The lobby bar is really nice. Nice selection of martini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that run $14-16, and mixed drinks. They give you a plethora of snacks with your drinks like nuts, plantain chips and olives. The lobby bar extends outside to a nice patio area that really relaxing at nice hearing the frogs and the ocean. They also have coffee, desserts and tappas if you are interested in a little snack. Mares Breakfast We had the breakfast buffet twice which was great! We often got up late and just used it as a brunch and skipped lunch because you get a huge amount of selection. You can choose between the continental buffet or the hot food buffet. Contintal is often good enough in that you get coffee, champagne (which was awesome) and a selection of fruits, breads, cereals and cheeses and cold cuts. We love the smoked salmon can cold cuts. The hot buffet includes omlet stations and sasauge waffles and everything else you would expect. The price was $20 for the continental and $26 for the hot foods, and it almost seemed as though it was more worth it the get the buffet over the ala carte. Overall the food at the ritz was excellent. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re kind of lazy so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to venture out too far to get food especially with our baby but if you are on a budget there are a bunch of reastaurants outside the hotel within walking distance. What to do The only excursion we took was to the El Yuncai rainforest. But there is probably plenty of other stuff to do like visit other islands and go to old San Juan. The rainforest itself is ok, I felt it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything special but nature lovers may like it. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend a tour either in that the whole tour we took started at 830 and ended at 300 PM. I say we spent 1.5 hrs looking at the rainforest and then 4 hrs on the road picking up and dropping off people on the tour. I would recommend just going yourself if you are interested so the time there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wasted on the road. Our time was precious in that days are short in the winter and we just wanted to sit by the pool and get fried. After a majority of the day was burnt from the tour we decided not to go out on another excursion since the resort was so sweet. It was on the tour though we were able to see other hotels like the Conquistador and the Gran Melia Resorts. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look as inviting as the Ritz and were SO far from the airport, we were glad we stayed at the Ritz. Final Thoughts All in all the Ritz is a great place. There is a casino there but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have time to go because we were enjoying the rest of the hotel so much. Complaints of price I feel aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t warranted because it should be expected being at the Ritz Carlton, they gotta keep up their name somehow. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to other beaches like St. Thomas and Bermuda so the prices in Puerto Rico weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so shocking. The service, resort grounds, food and pool were great. I highly recommend the Ritz San Juan to anybody looking for a stress free and amazing vacation.

Facilities: The hotel itself is gorgeous. The garden, pool, and beach are perfectly groomed, immaculate, and stunningly beautiful. Our room was clean and bright, with large windows. The \"city view\" actually included some distant mountains, so if you could overlook the big and less attractive rooftops, there was something pretty rest your eyes on. The lobby is perfectly lovely and the spa is beautiful. I took a complimentary yoga class, which was invigorating. (There were only two students in the class, and I felt the instructor could've given more personalized attention, considering this, but other than that, it was a good class.) The treatment at the beach is first class; they will set up chairs and towels into a lovely bed and arrange that umbrella just to your liking. Very personalized, very helpful service there. Service Overall, service was a bit of a mixed bag. When we had someone's attention, they were consistently helpful and a few employees truly went above and beyond. There were other moments though when it was unnecessarily difficult to get someone's attention. Trying to order food at the beach and cocktails in the lobby took much longer than necessary. And it took 2 phone calls and 1 hour to successfully obtain extra towels in our room. But who cares? We were on vacation, and it didn't concern us too much. Didn't diminish our enjoyment of the stunning views and peaceful atmosphere. If you expect to feel like other people are bending over backwards for you every time, then stay somewhere else. But if you want to be relaxed and a bit indulged (you're on vacation!), then you will be here. Chill out. You'll get what you need, it just might take a few extra minutes. Food We ate at Il Mulino and it was fabulous. Be sure to eat here if you can swing it; it is a true indulgence. The staff was impeccable and the food was delicious. The amuse bouches were abundant, rich, and wonderful. Make a reservation! Breakfast buffet was fine. Included mimosas, which was lovely. The rest of the buffet was kind of typical. I felt they should've worked hard to incorporate local, tropical fruits and flavors. (Rice and beans, plaintains, fresh citrus, different banana varieties, fresh coconuts--any of these would've been a welcome addition.) But it was enjoyable, nevertheless. I am vegan and they did a fantastic job accommodating me at every meal. Soymilk was on hand, waiters were well informed about the ingredients in the different offerings. A+ for that extra service! People complain about food prices here, but we didn't find them shocking. They were the same as we would expect to pay if we walked into any upscale hotel in our hometown (Boston), so we really didn't think that was worth a comment. Yes, it's pricey. No, its not more than we were expecting. And, anyway, there are a dozen cheaper options if you are willing to walk 5-10 minutes off the hotel property down Isla Verde avenue. There's no shortage of food options. Location Perfect for a quick getaway. So easy to get to from the airport ($12 cab, 5 minute drive), and on the most beautiful stretch of beach. Soft sand, gentle surf, not-too-deep water for a good distance off the shore. Trip to Old San Juan is less than 15 minutes without traffic ($20 cab). 1 hour drive from the rainforest. We also visited the mangrove forest in Humacao on a Pure Adventure guided kayak trip, which was a great time.

The ritz not only had a menorah that was lit by a rabbi, but they had cookies out each and every night next to the menorah! How sweet!

My family and I walked into some other hotels we considered as well and we glad we chose the Ritz. Some advice. The cab ride is about $12 from the airport to hotel and is about a 5 min ride so don't do transfers with your travel agent. If you are sick of the $15 drinks at the Ritz there is a modest sports bar around the corner that has drinks priced very reasonable. There is also a great little gelato/dinner place called Pui Bella about two blocks away is is great for Breakfast and the Gelato is fantastic. There is also a Denny's around the corner if you need something at 2am. :) There is also a Walgreens within walking distance so if you want to buy hairspray, or sun tan lotion there you can and it will not be an arm and a leg. Plus it is always nice to fill the mini fridge with water that is not $5 each. If you are not on a plan with the Ritz breakfast alone can set you back over 30 per person. So there are some reasonable options nearby. The casino is one of the best on in San Juan. I didn't eat in the Resturants at the hotel for dinner but did eat at Taste in Old San Juan... By far one of the best places I have ever eaten. A little trendy in decor, specializes in smaller plates but fantastic and you should try it out.

From the moment we arrived, we received excellent service. We had requested a pool view room, which were told would have a balcony and it did not, but that was o.k. The rooms were spacious and the staff calls you right away to see what you need. I recommend a pool or ocean view room, to save yourself the worry about airport noise. It never bothered us, even at the pool and beach. We got the Reconnect Package, which I highly recommend, plus our kids ate free. It saved us a lot of money. You get two adult breakfasts free daily, plus $100 resort credit to use at several of the restaurants, spa or gift shop. You can certainly find deals here if you seek them out. The pool and beach were great and there were a lot of children, but we had kids also, so that didn't bother us. The hotel had movies and a kids camp for the younger children. The food at BLT Steakhouse was fantastic and our credit covered a meal there. In fact, we ate dinner there twice. My one suggestion would be that you stay on top of your bill, which we did daily. There were erroneous charges every day, that had to be taken off, and I think that was due to the fact that we got a vacation package when we booked. The staff was happy to oblige.

First of all I echo the previous review of the property 100%. This is a perfectly nice hotel and we had a very nice trip but there is nothing about the vvisit that really \"blew us away\". We are a family of five, two parents and three older teenagers. We were very comfortable in two adjoining rooms. We had pool view rooms on the 7th floor which had a decent view but no balcony. The room and the location were good. The rooms are not very large but our rooms were very clean and well maintained. The beds were comfortable and the sheets were amazing. The restaurants at the hotel were really just ok and even for the Ritz they were expensive for what you got. I am more than willing to pay for good food but the food here was less than average and way more expensive than average. We also ate at Morton's at the Caribe Hilton, The Palm at the El San Juan and the Ruth's Chris at the Intercontinental (do you sense a theme here) which were all great with very good service. At the Ritz we ate at BLT, Mares, OBG and the Il Mulino and none of them were great. We paid close to $500. for the Thanksgiving Buffet at Mares and it wasn't very good. We ate at Mares for the breakfast buffet at $26./person and that wasn't even average food. The pool food I also found less than average although my kids thought it was fine. My kids (14, 17 & 22) enjoyed the fitness center, it wasn't crowded and they especially enjoyed the (free) Yoga classes in the morning. The classes were very small and the instructors were great! Unfortunately otherwise there was very little activity at the hotel. The pool area was nice and I actually thought it was less insane than most resorts I have stayed at. The kids and families were generally surprisingly well behaved and well mannered. Of course there were the few that felt that they were entitled to get their \"money's worth\" by staking claim to all the chairs and pool floats whether they really needed them or not. (sorry for that small rant) The beach was very nice also. Despite the holiday crowds the pool and beach staff were great about finding chairs and umbrellas whenever we needed them. There is usually a bowl of oranges at the towel stand which was nice as a snack. The waitstaff also came around a couple of times with small smoothie samples and on our last day the towel stand was making free snow cones. The waitstaff at both the pool and beach were a little harder to pin down. It seemed better if we flagged them down earlier in the day (around noon time) before the lunchtime rush.

I travel to PR often for business and have stayed at most of the finer hotels on the island. While I agree with those who say that this RC does not compare to some of the chain's finest properties, it certainly stands above all the other resorts in PR in terms of amenities, cleanliness, and yes, service. I found the attitude of the staff to be very service-oriented, though execution was inconsisent. The property's public areas are in exellent shape and well maintained. The pool area is impeccable, and while there is no adult-only section I did find more privacy/serenity near the bird fountain. Ironically, I found the pool service to be the fastest and most organized in the hotel: wait people constantly asking if I needed anything, and drinks and food delivered crisply (they may have had extra help due to the busy holiday period). The rooms are somewhat small (as are the balconies if you happen to want to pay for one), but they are clean. Wear and tear is evident, but nothing terrible. The food in the hotel is generally very good (surprisingly so at the pool); yes, it is very expensive but we knew that going in and it didn't bother us. We ate at all the hotel's restauants: the prices at Il Mulino (for what you get) actually did disturb me and overall I left with the impression that it's nowhere near as good as it (and so many others apparently) thinks it is; BLT was our favorite in all regards (excellent wine list with some gems), we actaully liked the fish dishes better than the meat; breakfast/lunch at Mares was not as good as other RC's, but was fine....service here was the worst, long lines at host stand, endless waits for coffee refills, etc.; Ocean Grill is good for lunch (pool food comes from this kitchen, too), it also serves sushi Wed-Sun nights which was good-not-great but the ambience was nice (outside, ocean, etc.). The Lobby Lounge is enigmatic at best what with loud music at night, children running around, food service, etc. We did not return after the first night. Casino looked nice but honestly we didn't partake. Overall it was a fine vacation at a fine hotel, nowhere near the glitz and refinement and beautiful people experienced at other RC resorts (Florida, Hawaii, e.g.), but that's not such a bad thing because the at-tee-tude and entitlement (among adults and children) is also very much in check compared to others....to me this is a (pleasant) reality of vacationing in Puerto Rico.", "Date": "December 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Penna", "Title": "\u201cThe perfect vacation resort.\u201d", "Author": "jmldra", "ReviewID": "UR50176965", "Content": "My stay at the Ritz Carlton in San Juan was great.

I stayed here with my husband and baby (11 month). When we arrived, they gave us a smal room - with two double beds. At the time they said that they did not have a king size bed and that the acutal room accomodations were not guaranteed. I did not know what that meant exactly but they did say that they would change our room the next day. I was a bit annoyed but, we made the best of it. They did provide a crib for our baby and some toiletries for her. The next day, I reminded them about the arrangements and they promptly changed us to a suite. The lady working at the front desk was very nice and she moved us quickly. We were very pleased. What i liked most about the hotel was the service. I must say, the staff was very attentive. They provided cold water at the pool and the beach area without xtra charge, and they would sometimes even give you frozen drink samples. There was also fruit baskets at the towel stations that you could eat. They also provided us with a pack and play both at the beach and the pool which I must say, was a blessing when u travel with a baby. We were very comfortable. The service at the beach was just as good. We met the towel/chair guy Juan Ramos which was very nice and went out of his way to accomodate us. The cons about the hotel are: 1. the food is outrageously priced. I mean, $14 for a burger was a bit much and we come from NYC where prices are already high so we are used to that, but. we still found that to be a bit too out there. we found ourselves eating out of the hotel most of the time.:( which is not the best or most comfortable thing to do when traveling with baby. 2. the cost for the parking is $25 per day, which was also outrageous. We did not rent a car b/c of it. Other than those two factors, the hotel itself was great. the beach there is not the best in PR but is not too bad either.", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cNot Perfect, But Totally Worth It\u201d", "Author": "TeamTestudo", "ReviewID": "UR49070111", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from a very nice three day trip, where we stayed at the Ritz Carlton. While this is clearly not the best hotel in the Ritz porfolio, it is definitely worth booking if you head to San Juan. Pay close attention to this paragraph if you have complaints about the price of this hotel - remember that this is a top-line hotel in a resort town. My advice is to book through Apple Vacations online. We did this, and the price for a three-night stay with airfare from Baltimore was only $1250 for the two of us. That's only $416 per day WITH airfare! In fact, it was $65 less per person than the same package at the Marriott. I read a review where the family spent $526 per night and got charged for additional fees. I can assure you that the $1250 is not a misprint and the only additional charges on my final bill were the restaurant/bar charges that I put there during my stay. I tipped the doormen and the maids when I used ther services - there were NO \"resort fees\" on my bill. There was no charge for using the fitness center either. LOCATION This may be the only downside to staying at this hotel - if you plan to venture out a lot. Even though it is only 5 minutes from the airport (in fact, practically right on the airport property!), it is a $15-$20 cab ride to get just about anywhere else. This was possibly our biggest expense for the three days because all of the restaurants and other places we wanted to visit were in Old San Juan and Condado. It almost made more sense to rent a car. STAFF Check-in took about 5 minutes and the front desk person was as curtious and friendly as possible. Ditto the bar staff and the lunch staff at Mares. Casino staff was equally as friendly. FOOD The only time we ate at the hotel was for breakfast/lunch and tapas in the afternoon at the bar. The food at Mares is very fresh and well-prepared, albeit very pricey, and the staff was fantastic. The bartenders in the lobby bar were friendly as well and the tapas were decent. I did not eat at Il Mulino or BLT (although I have been to the BLT here in DC), but the menus looked great. POOL/BEACH Awesome. Pool is large and very nice. Beach area is clean as well. I never had a problem getting as many towels as I wanted or finding a decent spot by the pool or beach at any time. Beach staff was quick to move chairs to my desired location and set up an umbrella quickly if I so desired one. My only complaint about the beach/pool is that it is definitely quicker to go to the bar for drinks as the waitstaff was tough to track down. Overall this is a great hotel and again I highly recommend checking out the deals with Apple Vacations. I can see how this hotel would be extremely expensive through direct booking. Hotel staffs don't get much friendlier and if you are overly concerned about price, then you clearly shouldn't be booking a vacation at a Ritz Carlton. There's an Embassy Suites and a Holiday Inn right down the street. Bottom line - if you want a relaxing beach getaway at a classy hotel, this is the place.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cTop-notch service\u201d", "Author": "6van", "ReviewID": "UR49051879", "Content": "Third-time repeat guest and enjoyed three night stay.

I have read many of the recent reviews and have formed some of my own opinions. Arrive at the airport, collect your luggage, go to the taxi stand and in 5 mins. you are greeted with smiles at the beautiful entrance to the Ritz-Carlton. The check in process is very simple, although I had found that some of the front desk staff are not as accommodating as others. The manager was very nice and welcomed us as well. The room we booked was an ocean view with a balcony. ( Make sure you have a room at least on the 6th floor as tall palm trees block the views below. ). The room is what one would expect; solid doors, robes, slippers (by request ) free water bottles, ipod clock radio and clean! The only complaints in the room are 1. the 12\" mattress with a duck filled mattress top is out dated. For a hotel of this caliber I would expect some of the most comfortable beds known! 2. The bath towels felt old, never soft. Again, I would expect much better quality. Breakfast was the best part of the day. The staff in Mares Restaurant are the nicest bunch of people I have ever met. The food is fantastic and with most packages, it is also free! Special members of this staff include Letti, Angel, and Chef Jeremy, who made my family feel as if they were the most important people at the hotel. After breakfast, off to the pool or beach. The lounge chairs are very comfortable and the staff members at both locations are really nice and accomodating. Some reviewers complained about paper cone cups for water at the pool. They are right, it is annoying. But if you ask for a cup, the staff is more than eager to accomodate your request. We stayed at the beach most of the time. Several Hints: Go early and reserve your lounge chairs, umbrellas and tables. Bring bug spray as the beaches do have problems with sand fleas and flies. I was never bitten but my wife had numerous bites. If you have children with you like us, walk 2 blocks to walgreens. Buy pails, shovels, water boards, lotion. My kids loved the waves and clean warm water. The ocean bar restaurant serves very nice lunches and competitive prices to what I would expect in a hotel like this. A special member at this restaurant was William, who again made my family feel like royalty. For dinner, we went to BLT and Il Mulino several times each. BLT has great food but pricey! We ordered a bacon appetizer that was great, a rib-eye that was perfectly cooked and I had a great dessert; crepes with passion fruit. Il Mulino is by far the best italian restaurant I have ever gone too. Outrages food and a friendly staff made the evening complete. Hint: For my family, 1 salad, 1 dinner, 1 kids dinner and dessert was enough to feed my family of 4 quite well for approx. $70 plus drinks. Not bad for a great restaurant. If you go to Old San Juan, try Raices restaurant. Really good authentic food. Visit El Morro Fort and spend some money at the shops in town. You can find some real bargains. Oops, I almost forgot, the daily resort fee. You are charged 11% of your daily room rate for a resort fee. This allows you to use the facility and internet. If you calculate, a ocean view balcony room is approx $526 dollars so this comes out to $57.86 a day. A RIP OFF!!!! Add 12% tax per day and the daily price soars! We booked the piece of mind package so the free days were not charged either of these fees. Shame on the hotel for charging these outrages fees! But we will still return.

Overall, the grounds are well kept, the pool area and beach were great! However, I was dissapointed right from the start. At check-in, we were informed that we woule get a room with double beds as our package did not allow a room selection. We had the option to upgrade for $30 per day. My husband basically had to negotiate and plead with the receptionist in order for us to get on a waiting list for a room with a king side bed. While this may not be the biggest issue for the common person, quite frankly we are used to getting upgrades and accomodating services at most 5 star hotels. Overall, the rooms are clean and spacious. With our package we were stuck overlooking the pool. No balcony and a restricted view. At this point, we probably would have been better off at the marrriot to get a balcony, better view and settled with the so, so service. A mojito was about $14.00 and change. We spent approximately $71.00 for nasty quesadillas, a cobb salad, and two mojitos. We learned quickly and decided to venture of the resort to eat a simple lunch. Just next to the hotel is a local sports bar, Score 101. Margaritas and mojitos were approx $4.50. Sandwiches and appetizers were okay and just under $10.00. We ended up walking a few blocks down to Walgreens to get water and snacks and vacated the compact refrigerator of the overpriced Ritz snacks. Overall, the beach was great, vwey calm the first two days and thenn a bit choppy. There was was not much seaweed or coral and you can venture into the water without water shoes. We quickly found out that the lounge and most restaurants shutdown close lto midnight. We like good music and entertainment here and there. We ventured to El San Juan Hotel and Casino for entertainment. In fact, we were regreting not booiking our packege with them as they were significantly cheaper and the ambiance seemed more enjoyable. Our last day having breakfast we were completely ignored and actually asked for our check and it never came. Having left our room number with the waiter who c hecked on us once, we left.

I stayed mid-week off season and found the service to be impeccable. I were there for a 4 day stay and it was great to be so close to the airport.

Every single employee that we encountered was polite, helpful, and welcoming. Check-in went smoothly and our room was ready early. The concierge service was fantastic, particularly with off site restaurant recommendations. There was one service snafu that is a sort of funny. The iguana by the pool went to the bathroom in the pool. The poo was quite disgusting. (Personally didn't know iguana's could swim). I notified the pool shack, and it took an excessively long time for them to come clean it up, 1/2 hours. They should have been on that straight away. This said it was a really random event and I am not sure anyone knew what to do. Room: The room was nice. The room was very clean with 2x daily service. The room was on the smaller side in our opinion, but was perfectly adequate. We did notice the wear and tear on the room, which might not be as noticeable in other Ritz Carlton location. Nice flat screen television, but no Hi Def. There was room in the mini-bar for some of our own stuff. We also used the in room coffee service and it was just fine for our needs. They even left us extra water, coffee, and creamers after we asked. Food: We ate at Il Mulino one night and it was ever better than we anticipated. WOW. The service, the food, the wine. Just WOW. Probably one of the best meals we've had this year. Pool: The pool is very nice. There are plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas. Also plenty of floats for the pool. Poolside service was great. Definitely not pushy service at all, but available if you need them. Towels were plentiful as well. Beach: The beach was less popular when we were there, again plenty of sunbeds, umbrellas, and towels (separate place to get a towel by the beach). The beach and water were very very clean. The water was pretty calm when we were there. We didn't spend much time by the ocean though. Fitness center: The fitness center was quite nice. Plenty of equipment and there were classes as well (I saw total fit and zumba). Water and towels available. Some cardio equipment has individual tvs with most channels. Also tennis courts and equipment available. Casino: We had a great time in the casino. Poker tournaments nightly, and 1 poker table with as cash game. All in all not a perfect stay but we still really really enjoyed ourselves. I can honestly say we really enjoyed ourselves and would recommend this hotel. For the most part the service made up for other shortcomings of the hotel. Note for budget minded travelers. There is a Walgreens druggist almost right next door. Go out the front of the hotel and it is less than a block away to the right.

This was our 10th Anniversary so we upgraded to the Club Level. Well worth every penny and then some. The Club level concierge were attentive and knowledgeable and went out of their way to make your stay wonderful. Having breakfast,lunch,countless snacks and drinks available (Club Level inclusive) to us though out the day was awesome. I highly recommend the Mojitos! The Concierge on duty always had one \"to go\" for me after lunch to take back to the beach. Club level is only offered on the top 2 floors. The limited access allowed us to meet some great greats that we otherwise would not have. Club Level also gave us access to a computer so it was a nice way to email home and check in. We did dine out each evening. There are lots of great local fare restaurants to choose from nearby. We did eat at Il Mulino on site and had a superb meal! Enterprise car rental agency is on-site. This was so convenient and effortless. We enjoyed the morning hiking the El Yunque rain forest. Stopped at a beach for a quick swim then off to the outer Island of Vieques. A 45 minute boat ride to one of the most memorable adventures, a bio luminescent bay. This is a must do! Take the time to do this outer island tour. There are others on the mainland but you can only kayak through those bays, not swim. The swimming brings it to an incomparable level. \"Hidden along the Caribbean coast is one of the most spectacular Bio luminescent Bays in the world.

Nothing local and pretty much just burgers and heavy foods. Drinks are standard cost for all upscale hotels. Beach/water is not really pretty but lots of space to lounge. We rented a cabana and for the cost they were not nearly as nice as the cabanas they have at other RC beach properties for the same cost. Service on beach was great from guys setting up the loungers and umbrellas but any service for drinks and food was horrible.

We waited over 1/2 hour to give our order to someone - and even then, the person took it begrudgingly because she clearly wasn't our server (our server seemed to be MIA to all around).

Check in was pleasant enough, we were sent to a room, my wife did not like it and we decided to upgrade to an ocean front, which was worth it. (This was our 5th wedding anniversary, so this place would have really distinguished itself, if it had provided the upgrade at no charge.) We were traveling with our 9 month old son and they provided a crib, room was great what you would expect from a Ritz, bathroom was Ritz quality. The hotel is a on a nice beach right outside san juan, we stayed on the premises for a week, only went sightseeing one day so we found the hotel to be very comfortable and relaxing. The beach guys were awesome setting up chairs and umbrellas, the pool guys were very good as well. The only knock on this pace is the price of the food, you would expect a markup on food at the ritz, it comes with the territory, thats not why I am knocking them , I expect the quality of the food to be at that price level. For example, we ordered breakfast from room service our first day there, my wife got the fruit plate, i got an omelet and a pot of coffee. How much would you expect to pay? We paid 75 and there was no truffle oil, juan valdez was not there to pour the coffee, fruit plate was lacking...omelet was good. We also ate at the ocean side bar which was good, considering we got burger, fries and wings... The concierge was good, she mention a few places around the area we could go for lunch and dinner. The authentic PR food is good and the places around the hotel are good. Also check out Old SJ if you get a chance, many food options but is a taxi ride. We did manage to eat at BLT and the food there was good, we went for the prix fixe special and it was worth it. Staff is friendly. Hotel layout is nice, ocean front rooms with balcony are great, pool and city not so great. Casino is nice. Spa is nice, very good masseuses. Wife wanted me to mention that the railing on the balcony needed to painted, you wouldn't expect a little thing like that to be overlooked at the Ritz but it was.

Nearly everyone we interacted with was smart, pleasant to talk to, and very helpful. This is a quiet hotel, don't expect a lot of colorful Island flavor.

The room was nice, the bed comfortable and everything worked pretty well, though the water saving shower head is a drag when you try to wash off sand. I am not much for gambling so I can't speak about the casino, but it is set off from the rest of the lobby and you would have to seek it out. One thing I found slightly disappointing was that while the lobby had a bar, they didn't offer any coffee, snacks or bottled water for sale. I had to go all the way through the hotel to the restaurant to buy a cup of coffee and this wasn't available until 7 AM. Yes, they had a coffee pot and some bottled water in the room, but as expected, this is not great quality stuff to say the least. The gym is adequate, but if you are a serious workout person, you will be hard-pressed to get your workout done, due to limited equipment and a small room. Bring an i-pod since the tvs don't all work. Some other suggestions: pack some pool attire in an easy to reach part of your bag since you will likely arrive before the 4 PM check-in and you will probably want to get right into the sun at the beach or pool; buy some bottled water up the block at Walgreens and put it in the frig. in the room.

Nothing special. The staff at breakfast was less than average. They just didn't seem to go out of their way for you like other hotels. Majority of them would disappear for long periods of time and the rest of the time they would be shouting/speaking to each other in groups. Again, the staff at the beach and pool were just average. Nothing special. The pool and beach staff is understaffed. It would be awhile before we would see anyone to order drinks and food. Overall the service here is not what I would have expected at a Ritz. I believe most of the staff needs to be retrained and should show some euthusiam when speaking to guests. Besides the doorman (Rafy), Venus (Front desk) and Alexis (waiter pool/beach) every other employee needs to be retrained. No one remembered our names after 4 days there and only 1 staff member said \"its my pleasure\" Beach/Pool: The beach here is magnificent. The water is clean and clear, no waves, no rocks to worry about and no seaweed. The water is so calm and the sand is like powder. This part of San Juan is called Isla Verde and it is considered one of the best, if not the very best, beach in Puerto Rico. For this reason alone, I would recommend the Ritz. The pool is heated - very warm. It is nice and very clean. It is mostly crowded with children. The hotel offers complimentary use of floats for the pool and snorkling masks for the ocean. At both the beach and the pool there were plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas to use. Yes people reserve them with their towels early but there was never an issue finding a seat. Rooms: We had an oceanview room with a balcony (#711). The view was beautiful. The room was very clean as expected. The bathrooms need to be updated. I was surprised to see a shower/tub combo and a shower curtain at 500 bucks a night. They are not luxurious at all. The towels were always clean, unfortunately they smelled like cigerettes everyday (am not a smoker). A reviewer once mentioned a moldy smell in the room, our bathroom also smelled musty but its due to a lack of a fan. Food: We had a great meal at BLT. Just like the one in the City. Tip: if you go for dinner between 6-7 pm, first bottle of wine is 50% off price - any bottle of wine from their wine list!! If you have dinner after 7pm, 1st bottle is full price, and 2nd bottle is 50%. IL Mulino was just okay. Good service and average food. I feel its over-rated. Breakfast at hotel was below average. We had a full breakfast included with our package and the options of the buffet were limited. I've seen better spreads. Guests: The class of people that were at the hotel was surprising. I wouldn't have expected low class behavior at a Ritz. i.e. People randomly cursing while they are passing by, mothers screaming at their children from 20 feet away, groups on the beach being loud and the characters at the casino were interesting to say the least. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the Ritz to a friend. I was disappointed in everything except the beach especially for the money we paid.

My mom was celebrating a big birthday year, and since we had stayed here in the past, we recommended staying here again to the whole group. There were a total of six of us, staying for seven days. Upon arrival from the airport, which is only a 10 minute ride, it was about 4pm. Only one of our three rooms were ready for us. I believe that check in time starts at 3pm. It wasn't a big deal though..we stuck everything in one room and when the rooms were ready about an hour later, we just transferred the luggage from one room to the other. The rooms were clean, and bright...just as I had remembered them. We had a city view room, but we were still able to see the beach quite easily. On our second night there, we made reservations for Il Mulino, the Italian restaurant at the hotel. This place was worth EVERY penny that you spent there. Only four of us dined there that night, and the bill came to about $480, which included salads, apps, main course, wine, and desserts. The wait staff there was super friendly and super good. I don't mind paying for something if you are going to get something worth it in the end. On our fourth night at the hotel, we decided to do a special dinner at the BLT steakhouse. This is where the \"you don't always get what you pay for\" comes in. We made reservations for six, were seated at a table right next to the serving window, and were given menus. We ordered drinks and were given time to look through the menu. A lot of time. We must have waited for 20 minutes or so before we could grab any of the waiters' attention. My husband and I ordered a $89 steak, obviously for 2, and a bunch of sides for the table. We ordered our steak medium well (and this was after asking the waiter what they consider pink throughout the middle), and it came out like a brick. A burnt, blackened $89 brick. I cut into the very middle, thinking that it might just be the outer parts that look well well well done. But no, it was cooked so well done that when you bit into it, it was like having a mouth full of saw dust. I'm not exaggerating. Finally, after trying to get the waiter's attention for another 20 minutes or so, we told him that the steak was too well done, and that we wanted to send it back. The look he gave us! It was like a \"how dare you want to return this steak\" sort of look. He took it without a word. And about 10 minutes later, another waiter brought over a new steak. Then he mumbled something in Spanish, and then in English about taking the steak from another table. The service was terrible. Absolutely terrible. Our waiter only came by once to refill drinks, and never came back after the food was served to ask how it was. I would definitely NOT recommend going there for dinner. The only other complaint that I had about the hotel, was about our final bill. There was a charge on there from BLT for a night that we weren't there. (we didn't charge any of the restaurant bills to our room) When I went up to the front desk to inquire about it, the front desk guy just looked at me and said, \"it's a charge from BLT\"....yes, I know that. I then asked for a copy of the receipt. He came back 15 minutes later, to show me that a shrimp cocktail and two drinks made up the bill. He showed it to me. I looked, and saw immediately that it wasn't even made out to our room, but another room on the same floor. I pointed out that the person didn't even sign it to my room. He looked at it puzzingly and then said, well, do you know Mr. blah blah blah? What difference does that make?!! Like, if I knew him that would be okay for me to pay for it? It then took him another 15 minutes to take it off my bill. All he said was \"The amount has been deducted.\" There was no \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience, or for our mistake.\" And then just flipped my final bill onto the counter. I wouldn't expect that sort of service from the Ritz. I've stayed at Ritz-Carltons many times, and have always received the best service. I most likely would look for another hotel in San Juan, should I think about going down there again.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service but expensive\u201d", "Author": "cabosanlucas", "ReviewID": "UR33767825", "Content": "Stayed at the Ritz June 18th through 22nd, 2009.

Check in was easy and pleasant. We had booked a package through funjet that had gift cards and coupons. The wonderful staff at the front desk knew about our little extras and was prepared with them for us (I had read on another review that this was a problem at the Ritz - not for us). We were asked if we'd be going to the casino and were given $40 in match play upon check in as well. Our bags were promptly brought to our beautiful room. We were not facing the beach (which we knew ahead of time) and I'm going to be honest - how much time do you plan to spend in your room looking out the window? We headed downstairs to walk the grounds (which pipes in the sounds of coqui - silly and cute) and try our luck at the casino. There were tables ranging from $5 to $100 which was nice. We took advantage of the Castillo Tours \"kiosk\" in the hotel for the Rainforest hiking excursion. I highly recommend this. It was a fantastic experience and was more organized than trying to plan this independently. The tour guide was very knowledgeable. Great attention to detail by the housekeeping staff who noticed after the first night that I drink water during the night and therefore placed the complementary bottled waters next on the nightstand each night thereafter. The pool was not overcrowded and the friendly and attentive staff walked us to a spot that met our needs (sun with an umbrella if we wanted shade) and set up our towels for us. There were servers who brought cold water and fruit smoothie samples around while we were at the pool. This didn't continue on the beach - but I have to presume it is because it is a public beach. However, the staff on the beach was extremely quick in getting an umbrella set up when we moved out there. We didn't eat at any restaurants except the one by the pool (expensive, but if you go in knowing that you won't be shocked). We did some research ahead of time and found places with authentic Puerto Rican breakfasts and dinners. There is a coffee shop a block away that has reasonable breakfast and good Puerto Rican coffee. One thing to know before you go - cabs run in zones and can get pricey. It is $12 to the airport, $20 to Old San Juan, and $15 to Cornado (very good dinner at Aliji Moliji). Just know that ahead of time. I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews left here about the Ritz - but I just have this to say - it was wonderful. People can find fault in anything if they are looking for it, but they can also find the most fabulous time if that is what they are looking for.

ROOMS: a bit small but very comfortable. the beds are extremely comfortable and the alarm clock is equipped with an ipod dock to play and charge your ipod. the balcony outside of the beach-view room was comically small. POOL: we did not spend much time in the pool but it was nice. you can reserve private cabanas but i'm not sure how much that costs. the layout of the paths around the pool and to get to the beach is a bit cramped/complicated but the palm trees are absolutely lovely. the towel attendents are helpful and there are always cool pitchers of lemon/orange water that you can refresh yourself with. occasionally there were cool aloe towels. BEACH: the attendents were happy to take as many chairs and umbrellas as we needed and set them up on the beach where we wanted them. they also put the towels on the chairs including a rolled towel for a head rest. if you go later in the day you won't have a problem getting chairs but they might run out of umbrellas. FOOD: the food/drinks at the resort are very expensive, but you know that going into it. The breakfast buffet is $25 and includes unlimited champagne. outside of that we ended up paying $35 for two drinks including tip so big drinkers, beware! we opted to dine outside of the hotel several nights. the name is escaping me but if you go out of the hotel and walk about 3 blocks to the right, past the CVS there is a good cheap restaurant that does mexican with a puerto rican twist. we also took a cab into town one night and discovered many \"open air\" cafes and restaurants.

We stayed out of the casino, as we knew we would end up wasting our money :) The pool is gorgeous, but by the afternoon it was hard finding seating on our own, but don't be shy to ask the staff - they will find it for you, set up your chair, umbrella, etc. They also have floating mats available at the pool, but they get claimed quickly as well. We never had problems finding seating on the beach. The beach was nice, nothing exceptional. Don't expect the crystal blue water that you find at some islands, but it was relaxing. Other tips/recommendations: We rented a car, as we knew we were not going to eat at the hotel, so that was a good thing for us and we didn't have to pay taxis all the time. The hotel charges $20 for parking, while a block down the street (at the Denny's) is only $10. If you like cats, do the walk at El Morro which is down on the water. They keep hundreds of cats there for rodent control and they are spayed/neutered and protected by the Historical Assoc, just like the ones in the Colliseum in Rome. It was neat to see these random cats pop out between the huge rocks of the ocean. If you like Raw Oysters, go to Aguaviva in Old San Juan.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "washington dc", "Title": "\u201cSuperb for honeymoon getaway\u201d", "Author": "koteygrimes2008", "ReviewID": "UR28107883", "Content": "Took my wife for a second honeymoon in 2006.

Let's start with the location: nothing is nice around it - so forget venturing outside for a nice walk. The airport is very close by, but the noise from the airport is minimal. The property: It has some nice Ritz touches, but it is clear that this property could pass as your average Hilton or Embassy Suites. Those loyal Ritz customers will immediately notice the difference. Everything about this property is either average or below average. It is nice that they have free wifi everywhere, but I just passed a flee-motel and it has a sign that says free wifi everywhere on the property. The pool area is certainly ill equipped to handle even 75% occupancy at the hotel. You will be lucky to find a spot to relax around the pool unless you are there at 7am. There are two lonely tennis courts - no lights though. For a 5-star property, they should have invested in lighted courts. And you will need to cal in to reserve a time and commit yourself to that time. The Ritz should know that if people are on vacation, the last thing they want to be reminded of is appointments and deadlines. The spa is OK, nothing to write home about and it can use some professionally-trained masseuses. Overall, they are not too bad but don't expect what you get at the Ritz in Bali, for example. Then there is the cattle march for breakfast at Mare in the morning. Be prepared to wait in line (don't you hate this while on vacation) and be given the \"we-are-busy, you- are-hungry, and we-are-doing-you-a-favor\" looks from the wait staff. Also, be prepared to be reminded of school cafeterias - hungry guests in their not-so-clean beach cloths trying to feed themselves for breakfast, lunch, and part of dinner. I mean, people, c'mon, have you not seen food before? Can't you wait until you get to your tables before feeding your face off the buffet while walking around? Yuk! Not the Ritz fault here, but they certainly have to cater to such a clientele with matching attitudes. Then, there are the rooms. Average, and nothing special. But here is a question to the Ritz interior designers: Have you guys heard of cell phones? And if you have, do you know that most cell phones need to be charged? And, did you know that a couple staying in room will most likely have two cell phones that need to be charged? OK, so the next time you design a room for the Ritz, remember to leave some outlets handy by the desk. Gee, Howard Johnsons probably got this one figured out. Not the Ritz in San Juan. And, by the way, the last time the windows were cleaned from the outside outside was when Christopher Columbus sat foot on the island. And the casino, please Ritz, get rid of that eye sore. It is so not nice to have such a trashy place in there. Avoid if you can. Il Mulino is a terrible place in NYC, DC, and also at San Juan. Not recommended. Finally, and here is the best part: San Juan is the loveliest Caribbean place to visit. Old San Juan is so cute, so hip, and so charming, it is worth it to stay at the Ritz. There isn't a better place, anyway.

Hotel location: About a 5 minute ride from the airport. You could throw a rock at the incoming Jets...that's how close this place is to the airport Check in: Fast easy...We head up to our room to change clothing and head downstairs to get food. Our safe was broken, our phone was broken. Service to fix both were prompt...although the guy that fixed the safe stood there until i tipped him...We head down to eat. We decided upon OBG...or whatever they call the poolside restaurant. we waited about 15 minuted for our beers. The same guy that was serving drinks at the pool was the same guy that was our waiter. Food finally comes...not good at all...and way overpriced even for a Ritz Carlton. We head back to the room to nap ( we had been up since 4am ) we pull the very moist sheet back only to realize the very moist sheets have a ton of sand in them, not to mention the ketchup stains. We call guest services they send up a manager to change our sheets...which were just as dirty and had a pretty decent sizes tear. whatever...at this point we just want to sleep...We spent the night in the room only to realize that every time we leave the room and come back our allergies are pretty bad....turns out there is black mold growing in the bathroom...We switch rooms and the allergies subside...and our bed was a nice dry one ... instead of a moist one. Ground are very well maintained....very small pool area....only one pool...beach was ok....water was not very clear....tons of seaweed....and the jets taking off and landing every minute do not give this place a vacation feel...One thing that bothered me was the constant yapping on cells phones by guests. Its vacation people put the phone and blackberry away. The service on the beach is horrible...we had to flag down someone to get a drink every time except our last day. The towel service people drive around on 4 wheelers to pick up towels...so now you have sand being blown up at you every time one passes by not to mention the smell of the gas... I think there are three places to eat at The Ritz.( besides BLT and Il Milino) all three have really bland overcooked food. We did eat at Il Milino one night and i have to say the food was awesome and the service is what you would expect from eating at the ritz....too bad it wasn't the Ritz. In a nutshell The Ritz Carlton has very very very poor service, bland overpriced food, horrible location, and they really dont seem to care.

We didn't complain at the time because we wanted adjoining rooms and the hotel was \"at capacity\". Our daughters' room was okay - window was nice. The prices at the buffet restaurant were ridiculous. We felt like we were being ripped off. The New Year's Eve buffett was over $150.00 per person and the food was very ordinary. The BLT restaurant was nice - very expensive - but a nice meal anyway. The pool and beach were pretty but SO overcrowded. The pool chairs are on top of each other - the beach chairs too. If you wanted a cabana at the pool (which was still 3 feet away from the next person/not very private) it was $400. I thought that was an inflated price to say the least. I've been to hotels in Turks that didn't even charge for the cabanas. It was expensive to stay there and we don't mind if you are getting 5 star treatment.

Location: The hotel is located in Isla Verde, what I can only describe as \"Hotel Row.\" It's a lackluster strip of hotels, fast food joints and unappealing shops that I can only compare to Virginia Beach. I tend to prefer hotels set aside in more authentic areas, but if you want something in the thick of it, near San Juan but with a nice beach, this would likely be good for you.

Beach and pool attendants were personable and genuinely friendly, as were waitstaff. Maid service was quite good and room service is 24 hours and relatively prompt. The staff all made an extra effort to greet us with a smile and again, they always seemed genuine. Room: They knew we were there for a birthday and sent up a gift with balloons, and also gave us a certificate for a free trinket from the gift shop. Both were nice touches. The room itself was on a side corridor with a half-view of the ocean. Very nice, big bathroom with great amenities. The room itself was on the small side, with a big but uncomfortable chair and no room in the minibar for our own goodies. Some shabby details like a falling apart lampshade. Comfortable bed. No WiFi (surprising). Grounds: The beach is narrow and windy, but it is very swimmable. Pool area and grounds were immaculate, but hard to find a chair that hasn't been reserved at 8am by someone who doesn't plan to show up until 2pm. The pool was so cold that we never went in. I didn't want to, anyway, due to the number of kids in diapers. They need to provide a kids pool. Dining: We had room service once and ate at the beach bar once. Both were good but not remarkable in any particular way other than the price. We had lunch for four with a total of three alcoholic drinks for about $160. But dining in this area is just expensive in general - our meal at the BBQ \"shack\" on the roof of the nearby El San Juan was just as expensive. There are some good casual places within walking distance. Try Lupi's for simple Mexican food. Casino: Very crowded, but a good, fun atmosphere with locals and Ritz guests alike. Great people watching. We had decent luck on the slots and at the tables. Overall: I don't think I'd stay again, especially not at the full price.

Before leaving for this trip my husband and I were a little discouraged about some of the more recent reviews. We have stayed at other Ritz Carltons and were hoping to get the same service that comes along with the Ritz brand. We were looking for some serious R and R (I'm a stay at home mom to 3 and my husband owns his own company). We rarely get away for non-work related/non kiddo trips and this place did not disappoint. Upon arrival we were greeted immediately and our bags were taken. My husband started the check in process (no line) and at least 3 people asked me if \"I would like something to drink \"or \"if there was something they could get for me\". My first impression was really good. The decor is beautiful but understated. No gawdy fixtures, brass or overly patterned carpet. My husband asked for an upgrade and we bumped up to an ocean front room with a balcony. They did charge us an extra $100 a night but it was worth every penny, the view was amazing. The room itself was nice (comfy bed, flat screen TV, nice furniture) We were told our room was ready and went to out room to find someone resurfacing the marble countertop. The gentleman was very apologetic. At that moment the front desk called to make sure our room was ok and we explained to them what was going on they were very apologetic also and gave us the upgrade for the night free. We then headed down to the pool area to grap some lunch and some drinks. We had read the reviews and knew the food was expensive and it is. We ordered 2 chicken sandwiches, 2 beers and a \"fruity frozen cocktail\" and it was $75. This was pretty much the standard lunch bill for the week. Although it was pricey, the food was really good, we didnt have one bad meal at the pool/beach. The service was really fast too and the servers were really friendly. Beach/pool service was excellent our entire stay. The beach/pool attendants were extremely nice and accomadating. Everyday they would set up two chairs (with three towels; one as a pillow, one to lay on and one to use if you got wet), an umbrella and a little table (to put drinks etc. on) for us. We never waited more than 5 mintues for the whole process to be done. These guys hustle, zero complaints about beach/pool attendants. I do have to say the hotel seemed \"quiet\", even in the middle of the day there were several empty pool chairs and you could pretty much chose any area to sit in. The weekend of our stay was busier but my Monday things had quieted down. My husband spent alot of time in the casino and he said they had some of the nicest pit bosses he had ever met. We ate at both \"in house\" restaurants and although BLT was good IL Mulino was amazing. The service was so attentive and the food was some of the best Italian I have ever had. If there was one complaint I could make it would be the lack of water pressure in the shower. I also think for the price there should be a seperate shower/tub. These things are minor. We did go down the street and visit El San Juan hotel. As soon as we sat at the bar and ordered drinks we were reassured of our choice to stay at the Ritz..

We requested to move as the room was completely unacceptable and was basically told that we would have to upgrade to an ocean front room to the tune of another $110/night. We did so b/c there was no way we were staying in that room. The new room had a great view and was nice (albeit a little small)... The pool area was great, but VERY crowded. The beach area was lovely as well, but the water wasn't the tourquise blue you'd expect. The restaurants were good, although EXTREMELY expensive.

I was told the only option would be to get another room with a King size bed. I declined the offer as it came with a full rate $800 per night price tag. I asked to speak with a manager so I could show him all my confirmation paperwork and hopefully get some resolution. The manager was called and after about 10 minutes he appeared and I told him my situation, showed him all my confirmation paperwork. He told me he would resolve the problem, he walked in the back and returned telling me everything was resolved. I thanked him and wished him a Merry Xmas. I was given the key and told to wait a few moments while housekeeping had to do something in the room. After a few moments we walked to the room and noticed that housekeeping added a double bed into a room with a King sized bed.... it was hilarious, essentially the entire room consisted of 2 beds...

Disgusting. Housekeeping brought a new blanket immediately and it was warm and fresh. 2) We had a standard room which could be used as an adjoining room. On the third day, someone checked in to the adjoining room and we could hear everything they said, even though they were speaking in normal voices. I could hear the man whistling \"Little Drummer Boy\" - that's not right.

To the credit of the Ritz staff, we called guest services at 2:00 AM and asked for a non-adjoining room, which they quickly located for us and we were moved within 15 minutes. Excellent service. 3) The next day we had to call guest services again and ask for a new iron, since the one in the new room was coming apart and didn't work.

We wanted to order beverages so looked for a pool server walking around. No one seemed to be interested in taking our order. We had to wait a long time and finally I got up and went over to someone to get service. He did bring us one beverage but we never saw anyone else so we gave up on any other service at the pool. Had dinner at Mares which was excellent. Prices are a bit high but since it is a Ritz, to be expected. Seafood was fresh and the Sangria was very tasty! (of course it was $55.00 for Sangria so keep that in mind if you are on a budget!) Went to one of the shops and decided to purchase a copper tile of a parrot which was in the window. The girl checked the price on the back which said $30.00, which was a pretty good deal. When she went to ring it up, it rang up as $45.00....a bit more than was quoted. She was nice and said she would give us a 10% discount since we were staying in the hotel. We did buy it anyway. Went to the casino which was fairly busy considering it was slow season. Roulette was pretty fun and I actually won some $$, since my husband lost I guess we broke even. Got complimentary drinks, which was very nice since we didn't get our beverages at the pool earlier! Checked out the next day and requested a valet to handle our luggage. We waited for a long time but no one ever came so we just handled it by ourselves.

With that in mind, memo to hotel execs: two things any business hotel absolutely must have are (1) easy access to Starbucks --FAIL-- and (2) wireless internet in every room --FAIL. These are not hard to accomplish, and something pretty much every Hampton Inn has managed by now. So even as a business hotel, it misses the mark. As a resort, I would love to have been in on the meeting which informed the planning and decisions behind this property. It's as though they decided to have a resort and left all the planning to someone who had never been on vacation. First --why on earth would you situate a resort on the most inhospitably windy point on the entire island. The wind is insufferable, strong, constant, and nagging. It blows the dirt-like sand everywhere, and every chaise is coated to the point where they don't appear blue, but brown. You can't hear the person next to you, it's so loud. I'm surprised more reviews don't mention this. It is very, very inhospitable, the windiness (the staff told me the wind was typical). Another point about location -- remote from everything. $50 bucks round trip to Old San Juan. If you are going to have a windy beach and pool area, for god's sake, heat the pool. I'm here on a weekend that is jam-packed, and have seen 9-10 people use the frigid pool the entire time. It is FREEZING, and when you get out, the wind is chilling. It doesn't help that the pool is beneath a forest of palm trees that effectively blocks the sun almost entirely. The hot tub has the usual resort problems. It's not hot. It's filled with infants and screaming children. Why bother, really? The \"gym\" has a lot of decent equipment packed into a regular-sized hotel room. It's unacceptable and pathetic. If they moved the same exact equipment into a space three times the size, it would be decent and even good. They should do away with the yoga studio (and I do yoga every day, so I'm not putting yoga down), and expand the gym facility or just do away with it altogether. It's almost dangerous how packed it is. Again, it appears to have been planned by someone who does not use gyms. Nice idea, bad execution. On the upside -- great staff, good concierge, great in-house restaurants, picturesque. Rooms are nice, though the standard room has a fairly small window and it gets a little dark. The showerhead sucks but decent water pressure. Tips -- the El San Juan Hotel down the road has 2 Starbucks and a very good restaurant called Coco that was pretty empty. The hamachi appetizer is good, crab balls were good, drinks were amazing. The little gelato store 2 buildings down has cheap, decent lunch and great gelato. Walgreens next to that for snacks, cokes, and lotion. Dont bother with Ritz poolside food and drinks. Lame on all accounts. BLT Steak and Il Mulino both fine. in sum, the very, very low end of the Ritz brand. Not a good location for laid back sun, and poorly planned/designed.

The front desk agent proceeds to pull out a laminated card and try and \"upsell\" us to various rooms. It seemed a little tacky to me and she never really addressed what I had asked for which was the concierge level. After the upsell speach, she ends up giving us an ocean view balcony room for free. Why waste my time if you are going to upgrade me anyway? When we get to the room, there is no promised pull-out couch for my son. So I trek back down to the desk and go back to the same lady and she acts like I am lying about there not being any pull-out bed. She has to call someone in the front office and confirm that I am lying (I understand some Spanish). Ends up that I am not lying about the bed and she moves us to a regular room. So much for the \"free upgrade\"! After finally getting a room, we headed to get some dinner. We decide to head to the pool bar and arrive a little after 6pm. We ask the server for a menu and she tells they closed at 6pm. The only other restaurants available were not kid-friendly so we are forced to go to our room for dinner.

Obviously this is not a huge Sandals-style pool scene. The beach was very nice. If you want many shades of blue in your ocean, you will be disappointed. This is middle-of-the-road as far as Caribbean ocean colors. The added 'resort fee' pays for chairs/umbrellas/kayaks/floats/sail boat..... Airport only a 5 minute cab ride, $10.50. Yes, you hear planes when outside. No, it didn't bother me one bit. It only seemed to occur once or twice an hour. But it was not overpowering nor intrusive. You hear the plane start to rev up, so it is not shocking or sudden. The positives outweigh that negative as you are on the beach so soon after landing. Likewise, we hopped a cab back to airport less than 2 hours before our return flight. We got as much out of our last day as we could, and thus huge pluses. If you take the 1:30 to 2:30pm non-stops back to the states, you will still get a few hours of sun before you leave. Food/Drink Prices: Expensive. But if I compare to other resorts and not the States, it is closer to that reality. Mojitos $14, angus burger $18. The kicker was a fried grouper sandwich at lunch was $38 . Ouch! I'd expect to pay approx $40-50 for a steak when on an island, but a 6 to 8 ounce grouper fillet on a bun was murder. Otherwise, yes it is expensive, but so is the El San Juan and the Intercontinental and the..... A great plus is the proximity to the El San Juan Hotel.

On the walk between the hotels we hit a nice Mexican place and a nice PR restaurant Platos (concierge recommended). Dinner at Platos with 2 rounds was less than $100, reasonable compared to Ritz restaurants. Take a $21 (each way) cab to Old San Juan - worth the experience. Early Sunday evening, stumbled upon a wonderful Puerto Rican festival or such. Down on the water near the cruise ships. A huge gathering of locals listening to large Latin band and dancing, with an outdoor 'bar' and food stands. Seemed like we were the only tourists in a sea of locals, which is wonderful immersion. (cruise ships nearby concerned me, but the cruise masses were elsewhere or perhaps had boarded by then?) Was told they do it every Sunday.

Typical Ritz room, very comfortable bed, enormous bathroom. The only downside was a lack of comfortable places to sit. One upholstered chair with ottoman and a desk chair, neither was super comfortable. I spent more time sitting on the balcony however. Complimentary bottled water in the rooms both for drinking and for making coffee. Room was serviced twice a day as expected, room was very clean, no odors or anything. Complimentary high-speed internet (wired) in the rooms, wireless was available in the lobby. I must admit I was concerned by reports of the construction noise. It did not start until 10 AM on the weekdays, and there was none on weekends. It was occasionally a tad loud lying by the pool but it was not bad and did not detract from the stay in any manner. I never heard any noise in the room from construction. Pool and beach service was excellent. Staff remembered our names, brought extra towels and such without prompting and offered to bring water, coffee, floats, etc. There were cabanas available for rental but other than having better lounge chairs they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem worth money (the lounge chairs by the pool were completely adequate). Being September, there was never any problem having our pick of locations around the pool; if anything there are too many chairs. Probably not on a busy weekend in the winter. Restaurants: We had breakfast in Mares every day but one. It was excellent, ample, and the service was outstanding. On our first day my partner ordered a glass of milk with his breakfast. On our last morning, the waitress who had waited on us that day (who had not been working the days between and was not out server this day) saw us and came to greet us and offered him milk.

There were some local twists to some of the items, such as the sauce for the wagyu skirt steak I had. The only item that was not great was the Parmesan gnocchi side dish that had way too much nutmeg grated on it.

The TV was a modest flat screen TV. The bathroom had one sink. The toilet was in a separate small room with a wall phone next to it for some reason. There was a minibar which was wildly overpriced. A can of coke cost $3.50. There is a large pool in back with extensive landscaping. Beyond the pool, a door takes you to the beach. The beach seemed clean but otherwise nothing special. The restaurants in the hotel seemed very expensive. We had planned to try the casual one but found it inexplicably closed. There are other restaurants within walking distance of varying quality and cost. The ones in hotels are invariably overpriced. Probably the best bet bet is the Metropol restaurant across the street. There is little to see or do at this location. There is a cockfighting arena across the street and that is about it. A taxi to Old San Juan costs about $42 roundtrip without tips but offers considerably more nightlife than Isla Verde. We went into the rather dreary casino at the Ritz but only to use the ATM. Excursions from the hotel are handled by Castillo Tours which has a small office there. We tried the catamaran snorkel trip. Perhaps because there were only 5 people booked, we were driven to Fajardo, the hopping off point for the trip, and unceremoniously dumped on the boat of a totally different tour operator who operated on the cheap. For example, while we were told that we would receive brand new snorkels we could keep, the snorkels used were old and well worn, held onto the masks by rubber bands and when one woman asked if she could keep hers, she was told a firm 'no'. We were offered no explanation or apology from Castillo Tours. It is rare to encounter this kind of dishonesty but despite the convenience of having the tour operater in the hotel, I would strongly suggest booking elsewhere. The hotel seems to be significantly overpriced. Our room had problems which would have been a concern at any price. Beyond the public areas of the hotel there is little to do in the area.

Then we tried to order a sandwich from the bar, 45 minutes later our cold sandwich arrived. The next morning at breakfast the trend condinued. I went and ate down the street where the prices were reasonable, but my mother opted to eat a $25 fruit plate. It took 45 minutes, and we had to ask twice where it was, just for a fruit plate. The beach in front of the hotel is in good condition, and they provide chairs, umbrellas, and towels for you to use free of charge. The pool area is also very nice, again towels and lounge chairs are available. The hotel is very close to the airport, so be prepared to listen to them all day long take off. Didnt seem to be an issue at night, luckily we could not hear them in our rooms. Room was in good condition, marble bathroom, and a very comfortable bed.

Some clouds at some point each day, but overall typical tropical weather despite the foreboding online weather forecasts predicting rain everyday... did not materialize. We were nervous about this hotel being 5 minutes from the airport---not an issue at all. Never enters your mind once at the hotel. Never heard a plane in the hotel. We could see some take-offs to the right when on the beach. Actually it was convenient for arrival and departure to be so close. We were nervous because there is some renovation at the hotel right now---again, a non-issue. It is secluded and shrouded, presenting no interference whatsoever. The staff of this hotel are outstanding! They are warm and accommodating. The concierge desk (especially Jessica) went out of their way to help us plan excursions (East Wind snorkeling to Icacos, night-time bio-bay kayaking, rainforest tour) as well as dinners in old San Juan (do not miss Baru!). It was like having a best friend on site to take care of you! Also compliments to the Ritz-Kids staff where my 10 year old spent some time (better for her than the rainforest outing)---she loved it! It is very expensive on site, so be prepared. We found a Starbucks down the street at the El San Juan Hotel and brought it back---better than $20/head for breakfast buffet!

The rooms and grounds were not quite as nice as other Ritz properties, but were still very nice. Although the hotel is near the airport, we heard absolutely no noise in our room. All staff we encountered (especially the concierges) were extremely nice and accommodating. The pool is beautiful and the grounds are well-manicured. All pool chairs were already taken by the weekend afternoons, but there were plenty available in the mornings and on the weekdays. The beach is public. The sand is not the clean, powdery white sand you see in other parts of the Caribbean. The ocean, however, is much prettier and blue-er than I expected. The Ritz beach service was very nice, as staff quickly set up chairs and a little table for us. As expected, food and drink is expensive. Frozen drinks are $15, Continental breakfast of juice, coffee, and pastries is $17, and the restaurants are overpriced (we ate at Il Mulino). However, it was what you'd expect at a resort. The fitness center was clean and well-equipped. I enjoyed a pilates class. Also included in the resort fee, are free bottled water, all the towels you want for the beach and for off property excursions, internet, and beach toys (floats, kayaks, etc). We left the property to enjoy many activities. We had a great time hiking at El Yunque National Forest, took a beach/snorkeling trip with East Wind Catamaran Company, and toured Old San Juan (it is a $25 cab ride each way). You can walk to other hotels and restaurants in the Isla Verde area from the Ritz. The El San Juan Hotel has a great evening atmosphere with live music and bar in the lobby, good restaurants, lively casino, and a hip pool area. There is very casual, but authentic Puerto Rican and Cuban dining at \"Metropol\" across the street from the Ritz. There are a few other very casual dining options, but the nice restaurants are all located in the hotels along Isla Verde (the El San Juan, the Intercontinental, and the Water Beach Club). These hotel restaurants are steak and Italian. Nice seafood restaurants are located in Condado, which is a $15 cab ride from the Ritz. There is also a bike shop \"Hot Dog Cycling\" down the street if you want to join a group ride. ***Please note that there is currently construction at this property, as they are building balconies on the rooms around the pool. They did not work on the weekends, but they resumed construction on Monday and Tuesday. Hammering, banging, and drilling into concrete was audible and visible in the pool area.

But the one think that we got upset about was the extra charges for bellman ($16) and maid($2/day) gratuities. We have no problem with these charges per se but the reception did not tell us upon checkin of these fees and as a result we paid double (i.e. we also gave them cash unknowingly).

I think that may have affected a few things that happened while we were there. this review may sound like I am complaining, but I just want everyone to know what to expect. It is a standard ritz property. It is nice, but nothing spectacular. So, if you stay (and I am sure you will enjoy your stay if you choose this hotel), just know what to expect. I arrived very late due to a four hour plane delay, and was given a room on the first floor. I asked for a different room, but was told that every single room was booked. I persisted a bit more, noting that I am a preferred member and stay at the atlanta property several times a year on business. no dice. I would normally be unable to complain too much about this - I mean, I booked a standard room and received a standard room, right? well, that is true except the person behind me then checked in and received a standard room on the 10th floor! umm? When I said something, the receptionist informed me that the person behind me paid a higher rate for his standard room. So I am being punished because my work negotiated a special rate for the 150+ rooms it booked for the entire weekend? not good. Regardless, the room was nice. It was a standard Ritz room. Very nice king bed, nice large flat screen television, nice bathroom. Nothing surprising, it looked like any other ritz. I was a bit surprised - I thought it might have some special resort like touches or amenities? nope. it wasn't even outfitted like a beach hotel - there wasn't even a clothesline to hang wet swimsuits on! we were forced to throw them over the shower curtain (ick). The property is very beautiful. Contrary to other reviews, I always saw beach chairs available by the pool, regardless of the time of day. Additionally, there are chairs available on the beach. My complaint with respect to that is that they only had one beach guy on Saturday (!) and it took twenty minutes to get two beach chairs set up. My husband got frustrated and tried to set them up, but no dice. the chairs are chained together so you can't have self service. The beach was nice and the water was nice and not rocky. We enjoyed it. I wouldn't recommend ordering food and drinks at the beach. we ordered lunch and drinks and they didn't even bring a little side table! we just came back from swimming and our drinks were sitting in the sand! we had room service and beach side service. yes, the food is expensive - this is the ritz. my husband claims the burgers were AWESOME, though and never complained about the price tag. my food was good, too. nothing fabulous, but very good food. the property is far away from anything but a few other beach hotels. it is indeed about 50 USD roundtrip into old san juan. I didn't like this too much. The casino is pretty small. I don't gamble, but plenty in our group did. They all said it was small, but the workers were friendly and they had a good time. there is definitely some miscommunication on the activities among the staff. I called the front desk at 6am to try to book the snorkeling trip I learned some friends were on for that day. I knew it left at 8.30 and wanted to see if there were spots avialable. every time I called, I would be told the activity desk opened a half-hour later. at 6, it opened at 6.30. at 7, it opened at 7.30. at 7.30, it opened at 8! I refused to hang up at 7.30 and demanded that someone help me. finally, fifteen minutes later, I was called by the concierge and informed that I had tickets to snorkeling. he said he had been there since 7am and could have helped me. this kind of miscommuniation is inexcusable at a property like this! Lastly, our plane was due to leave at 4pm the day we checked out. We called to get late check out - even asked to pay for late check out - and were rudely informed that our rate was already super cheap and late checkout wasn't avaialble to us. WHAT? Once again, I complained quite a bit and was able to get late check out (2pm) for an additional 100 USD. With the money my work spent on alcohol alone at this place (!) I think they made enough money off of us to not be so rude. To sum it up, the property is standard ritz - which is of course nice! the beach is very nice. the location is very out of the way - close only to the airport (which wasn't too noisy for us. yes, you could hear planes on the beach, so don't stay here if you want the \"deserted tropical oasis\" feel). the staff was generally helpful, but at times uninformed and twice rude!

Didn't matter--the kids had a great time going between there and the hot tub (and the beach, with a parent tagging along behind them.) We had a standard room with a pool view, although it felt more like facing an inner courtyard--albeit a pleasant one. The room was clean and well-appointed, but small, and the lack of a balcony --or even a window that we could open --was perhaps the one thing that drove me crazy. I felt hermetically sealed in. I had read complaints about noise from the airport. While the sound is deafening outside the front of the hotel, at the pool, the beach, and in the rooms it is not noticeable at all, which is pretty amazing. We actually liked the proximity to the airport, made the trip very easy. All in all, the Ritz Carlton is a lovely place, and one to which we would return.", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cMost un-Ritz Ritz hotel\u201d", "Author": "Izzyandsue", "ReviewID": "UR17399214", "Content": "This hotel truly is not a Ritz, should change their name to something else as it gives the Ritz a bad name. I would not recommend to anyone looking forward to staying at a Ritz. We first had multiple calls and emails with the hotel about our basic needs, early arrival (they asked for the time), connecting rooms, and late checkout by one hour. On the phone everything was fine, very pleaseant, and waiting for us. We had 2 rooms for a week. But when we got there at 2pm, problem with the rooms, will not be ready for 45 mins. after an hour they finally told us they didn't know when the rooms will be ready. We figured we can hang out there until 4, by 4:30 our rooms where ready and we went up. No appology, no \"we are sorry\", their attitude at the front desk is more Holidayinn Express than Ritz. Room was missing a few things, like garbage can, room service menu, but where resolved by tracking down the service crew. One night (3 am) we lost power in the room, we woke up very hot as the A/C was out, that is when we realize we had no power. However the hallway was fully lit, and the outside of the hotel had full power. A call to the front desk told us nothing, some rooms where out of power and they would work on it. Power came back by 7 or so, we got no sleep that night. NO appologies, no comments, this is not a Ritz. Other things to consider: 1. Beach closes at 5:30, no chairs or umbrellas from then until the next day 2. The A/C in the rooms, when it worked, was either subzero or tropical heat, no matter what temperature you set it at. 3. Poolside restaurant has over 12 employees, good luck getting them to pay attention to you the only customer sitting there as they will be busy socializing with each other 4. We had a very undercooked burger at the restaurant, we had to send it back and they charged us for 2 of them, since they had to cook it twice (amazing!!) 5. The pool area and beach and fully open to all locals, no restrictions. So do not plan to use the pool or beach on a weekend, it will be like a free community pool/beach. Use those days to travel elsewhere. The good news is my sister and her whole family could just walk in and meet us, have full use of the hotel, the bad news is so could every other local resident. 6.

And unwind we did! This was my second time staying at the Ritz Carlton in San Juan and the second time was EVEN better than the first. Our agenda for the long weekend was beach, pool, cocktails, dinner and repeat it all over again the next day. We were able to check in a few hours prior to the check in time and upgraded to the Pool View Room on the 9th floor of the hotel, which was an awesome view. The rooms were in top Ritz-Carlton fashion and we had no problems with the room the entire weekend. The hotel staff were always accomodating and we had turn down service every evening, bottled water, chocolates, and relaxing music playing in our room upon our return each evening. We spent a considerable amount of time at the pool and beach (10am-7pm) each day :) So, we really got to know the pool and beach operations staff. They all were absolutely great! We had lunch by the pool each day and again, the service was in top Ritz-Carlton fashion. On the third day, I had an ipod disaster and acidentally dropped my ipod in the pool. I was devestated because it would not reprogram or turn back on! But, Pablo Santiago (Beach and Pool Operations) saved the day and GAVE me his ipod! It was such a wonderful and thoughtful gesture. Also, on Sunday morning, we had brunch at Madres in the Hotel and it was fabulous! Fresh fruit, made to order omlettes, Puerto Rican cuisines, and mimosos, just to name a few of the items on the menu. Note: Madres has a daily full breakfast brunch buffet for $26.00/per person and on Sunday it ends promptly at 11:00am. The Full Service Brunch is $70.00/per person which begins at 12:30pm. We had the full breakfast for $26.00 and got there at 10:30am, so get there early! We did not spend a lot of time in Old San Juan on this trip, but of course its highly recommended for those that will be traveling to San Juan for the first time. Also, we did go to the El San Juan Hotel in the evenings for drinks and music, since the scene was a lot more lively.

A quick cab ride and you are at the hotel. There was no line at checkin but I had requested a king bed (guaranteed) and they offered me either a) two doubles or b) move off the Club Level floor. I wasnt thrilled with either but went with a). The grounds of the hotel are beautiful. The issue of other posters about being close to the airport was nonissue. Inside the hotel - I never heard planes taking off. Outside the hotel, I heard thrusts of engines twice. There is so much white noise between the wind, pool, other people and the ocean, do not give the airport another thought. The Club level was nice. I always compare other Club levels to the one at the St. Regis in Aspen. This pales compared to that, it was still worth the upgrade. Club level has 5 sittings a day of food / drinks as well as champagne/wine/mixed drinks at night. Free newspapers, coffee and drinks were a nice touch. If you have a young family (especially baby), the Club Level is a must in my opinion. It is open from 7am to 10pm. The service at the Club Level was great - staffed with a personal concierge. The food itself at the Club Level was ok - you'll get the impression of \"mass production\" but the convenience was great. Onto the rooms. The rooms are nice but nothing spectular. Somewhat small, nice view (although we paid for that), mini-bar (but no separate refrigerator as adveristed), nicely appointed bathroom, robes, etc. The glaring miss was no place to hang wet clothes after a day at the beach. How much to those clothes lines cost - $5! A nice TV with dvd player was included. The cleaning people were very good - nice ladies. Free internet access (but no wireless - only wireless in lobby). Onto the beach / pool. The pool is the main attraction at the hotel. We had no problem finding chairs and the towels were always abundant. Drink/waiter service was nonexistent. The staff did a good job of turning over the chairs. Down by the beach, there are 3 hammocks, many lounge chairs and a nice beach. The beach is wide and long with low breakers. It is not the crystal blue of tahiti, but is better than ft. lauderdale beaches. If you like to gamble, the casino was nice. Craps 2x odds, $15 and up blackjack, double zero roulette. No limit with many locals playing. Drink service was good. Onto dinner at the hotel. El Mulino - my only tip is \"do not order one of the specials if you do not want sticker shock\". An a la carte fish dish cost $80. Mind you - this wasn't the rare but succulent Japanese poison fish - it was Dover Sole! Maybe if the Sole had swallowed some caviar while bottom feeding I wouldn't have minded ;-) I don't mind paying up for a good meal, but I also don't want to pay $20 for a cup of coffee either (this is an example - coffee incident didn't actutally occur). We fared better at BLT -- fully priced but at least I knew what I was in for. Mares was ok - nothing great on the food. Overall, the staff was very pleasant and the property was nice. We met some nice people. I can't comment on the location because other than dinner in Old San Juan, we didn't leave the resort.

They have a great bar, club, live music, casino, etc. Very fun and definitely the hotspot in this part of town. I have to agree with others that there were a lot of children, but on our trip it was not too much and did not bother us. The rooms were not that great. I agree that it is definitely time for an update. I did not even have a comfortable bed and the walpaper was scuffed, carpet old and furniture dinged.

While it certainly was not a bad place, It was really no different than a Hilton or Marriott that I might say at in the states.

The service was subpar for a hotel in this category, my first night I requested a wake-up call and after setting this up the woman asked, \"is there anything else that I can help you with?\" At which point I mentioned, \"why yes, in fact I have a sports jacket that needs cleaning...what should I do?\" and the woman said, \"oh, I don't know anything about that...call in the morning and they can help you.\" I know I probably sound like a snob but this is the RITZ CARLTON, I expect top-notch service, not the same that I'd get at the Hilton or Marriott. The room was also very much like staying at a Hilton...to be honest, I couldn't tell the difference. Now, let me say some good things...the pool was wonderful as were the grounds. Also, the beach was very nice...I never thought of Puerto Rico as having such a nice beach. Overall, not a bad experience but nothing that would make me want to spend this kind of money again.

We stayed in an oceanview room on the 6th floor overlooking the pool and ocean with a perfect view of both. We arrived at the hotel shortly after noon and were in our room by 1pm. Check in was a bit slow due to guests at the counter who seemed to have issues, but we just waited patiently. We were offered water and a manager helped by taking some of our preliminary info while we were in line. Every staff member that we encountered during our stay could not have been nicer to us. We had never stayed at an RC hotel and have never been elsewhere in the Carribean so we can not comment on how other resorts compare. When booking the Ritz we were a bit nervous that it would only attract the more societal elite and that we plain folk would have a hard time fitting in. We could not have been more wrong. Every guest we saw were average, working class folks. No old, nose-in-the-air, wealthy types anywhere. As a matter of fact, the majority of the guests were on the young side: 20 and 30 somethings. So if you are looking for the \"I'm better than everyone else\" type of place that you don't have to share with the less wealthy, this is not the hotel for you. We found the room to be spacious enough. Don't understand how people see these rooms as small. Perhaps they are trying to cram a family of 5 into one room??? There is plenty of drawer and closet space for storing your belongings. Housekeeping did a fine job everyday except for Thursday. For some reason, Thurs. seemed to be an off day for service all the way around. We had to ask for a bath mat and coffee. This was not a big deal. Just trying to present an accurate picture. The beds are extremely comfortable, you sleep cradled in down. If you want to nit-pick: The room is not completely spotless, some of the furniture is a bit chipped, and the carpeting is a bit worn. The windows are not crystal clear to look through, but the hotel is on the ocean. Would you really want someone hanging outside your window washing them around the clock? The pool is beautiful, but, yes there are diapered babies and toddlers that share it with you. There are also loud, obnoxious cell phone users all around. I just don't get it. Do these people need everyone to hear their conversations? Are they showing off that they have the latest gadget phone? The pool area can become untidy at times, but again, this is due to lazy, inconsiderate guests who let their newspapers fly all around in addition to not putting their lunch dishes and cocktail cups into the trash cans that are all around the pool area. I Guess they need to be waited on hand and foot by the pool attendants. Each morning, in the wee hours, a maintenance crew washes the pool decking, the chairs, chair pads, and the tables, so each day it starts off being spotless. I truly believe the staff does the best it can here. On Friday there were a wild bunch of children at the pool, drinking and spitting soda into the water, splashing people, throwing half-eaten pizza and plates into the landscaped areas, antagonizing birds, etc. while their parents sat in the front row oblivious for the most part and yelling an occasional idle threat their way. We just moved to another section of the pool, where the water spouting from the lions drowned out the kid noise. During the rest of our week, the other children were well behaved and a pleasure to watch. This is not a reflection on the hotel, it's a reflection on poor parenting. Bottom line: the hotel is kid friendly, so prepare for it. Yes, the food is expensive here. We ate at Il Mulino for Sunday brunch. It was delicious. We breakfasted at Mares several days. There was so much to eat, we didn't need lunch. For that reason alone, it was a good deal for the money. We went off-site for some of our meals and never had anything bad. We even partook of grilled sandwiches in the casino and they were quite tasty. As to the casino, we never saw any dressed up people. It's true that no one wears beach wear, but we were way overdressed in nice slacks and tops. The slot seats were all stained and a bit gross and the patrons were basicly careworn local folks. I had read on TA about how dress was very formal at casinos in San Juan. We went to four different places and saw the same type of folks at every one. No need to be intimidated here by what you're wearing. Side bar: the slots literally eat your money, we never had or saw any big wins here. We don't play table games so we don't know if the odds were any better there. Drinks in the lobby lounge are $15 each. You can get the same drinks, while playing the slots for the price of a tip. Service is quick and efficient. We walked on the beach every morning. The white waves are very pretty. The water is clean albeit a bit univiting since the water looks a bit mucky where the waves break due to the brown silty sand that gets riled up. Walking on the beach is nice once you get past what I liked to call the high turn of a car racetrack in front of the Marriott. It's very steep there and you get quite a workout, but once past that area the beach is flat and nice. There are small shells and beach glass to collect. There is also broken, sharp glass around so watch your step. Yes, you will hear planes throughout the day, but it sounds a bit like a strong gust of wind. We didn't find it to be a bothersome noise. Another thing to be cautious about: We left most of our cash in the room safe and could not account for $100 on our second day. After that we carried our valuables with us any time we didn't have the Do Not Disturb sign on the door. Use the Hotel safe. Also, we were charged for an item from the minibar that we did not take. We just let both of these incidents go. We knew we had no recourse and decided not to let it spoil our vacation. To sum, I'd like to say that for the most part we had a wonderful time at the Ritz. Everytime we returned from our ventures off site, it was like a sanctuary. Is San Juan a beautiful city? No. But it has beautiful people who treated us with kindness and repect, and for that we thank them.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cService with a smile!\u201d", "Author": "BailsBrew", "ReviewID": "UR15583282", "Content": "Although I prefer a smaller, more boutique type of hotel, this property is very nice.

The pool was also great, and the grounds are beautiful. we even saw some very cool lizards running around, and at night, if you walk around you can hear the frogs singing.

The casino (and the whole hotel) is now non-smoking, and that was great too. I think overall it is a great place to relax and get away, with very easy beach and pool access that is comfortable and clean. Complaints would be the food - on every level. For what you pay to stay there (full price or not), I think they should include a continental breakfast. The hotel restaurant options are all very expensive. We ate at Il Mulino one night and were extremely disappointed both with the service and the food. The poolside restaurant menu was really limited, overpriced, and the food not very good. We discovered a small diner a block off the property called Cafe Piu, which has fabulous gelatto and a really nice staff, and just relied on it heavily for breakfast and lunch.

The location from the airport is very convenient, although you do hear the planes departing by the pool. Room: we didn't have a balcony, which was ok, usual Ritz, marble bathroom, comfy bed, etc. Our view was of the hotel next to us, which was ugly and the ocean. Service: not bad, not great. Pool service was tricky as more people started coming in on Friday, we arrived on Tuesday and it was very easy to get a drink. Pool: worked for me, although only 3 feet deep. Big enough that you were not bumping into people. Ocean: Not really a big ocean person, we did go out the first day there and it was very windy. More or less like laying out in front of a sand blaster, well maybe not that bad. The beach was clean. Casino: Spent every night in the casino. The casino itself is small compared to Atlantic City\\Vegas standards. They have the usual games - blackjack, let it ride, 3 card poker, poker and a ton of slots. I joined their player's club, was comped a whopping $45 at the end of the trip. Dealers aren't all that friendly, ran boring games. Restaurants: We ate at all (3) restaurants at the Ritz. The Mares restaurant wasn't bad at all, one of the better meals we had at the Ritz. Il Mulino was horrible, I was shocked. I ordered the veal parm, came out looking like a personal pizza. The veal porton was very good, but the sauce was gaggingly garlicly. The service was also horrible, taking 3 hours for a table of 8. BLT Steak was good, not great. Service was very good. I ordered the filet, was a bit dry. However, everything else was very good. Forgot one restaurant, the one near the pool, great burger and turkey wrap, the wings were very good as well. Price: Obviously not cheap - one thing that pissed me off was the non-optional 10% resort fee. I hate when hotels quote you a price for a hotel, then sneak that in there. Drinks poolside averaged around $15. Lunch for two without drinks will easily run you $40-$50. Golf: I played at Bahia and Dorodo East, both were amazing. Both were approximately 45 minutes away. Greens were extremely fast, like any hot area. Other Restaurants to check out: I HIGHLY recommend Pikayo, only 10 minutes from the hotel. Excellent food, cool location, everything was excellent. We also ate at Marmalade or something like that, in Old San Juan. Was nice to have authentic Puerto Rican food, also nice not to pay through the nose. Activies: We walked Old San Juan, went to El Morro fort, which I highly recommend. Did a half day trip to the rainforest, it was ok, got boring at the end. Hotel Summary: Not bad, not great. I have stayed at other Ritz's and Four Seasons properties. I always compare Ritz and Four Seasons on the same level. We stayed at the Four Seasons in Maui and that was unbelieveable.

The rooms are nice- very comfortable. The bed is amazing, and the tv is great, plus plenty of drawer space. While the bathroom is very clean, it has the standard tub/shower together. Unfortunately not many balconies, so that is definitely a downer. we had a pool/ocean view, but really wished there had been a balcony. Maid service was great. I spent my time at the beach, and the service at the beach was outstanding. plenty of chairs, but it was windy. Not so windy that you couldn't lay out - of our 8 days only 1 day had much rain, and I spent every day on the beach and didn't mind the wind- it kept you cool. the food was good, and I didn't feel the prices were steep. Resort food is expensive anywhere you go whether it's a Ritz or a Westin, and I felt the prices to be pretty standard. Il Mulino was amazing. Absolutely fantastic. While normally I love BLT, I was very disappointed to get a well done steak. Also, the service was pretty bad, so by the time they got around to asking me how it was, we had eaten all of the sides (they were delicious, as was the wine) and I didn't want to wait for another one. They didn't charge me for the steak, but again I came there with high expectations and was really disappointed. The concierge lost my friend's spa appointmet, but fortunately she was planning to cancel it. We had a major problem with the tour desk. Extremely unhelpful and getting conflicting information. Note that the tour desk is outsourced by Castillo tours, so if you are having problems with them, just go to the concierge and ask for help, a mistake we made too late, and unfortunately resulted in us not going to Culebria as we had hoped. Kamil the tennis pro is fantastic! If you are thinking about doing a lesson or a clinic- book it! He was so much fun and gave me a great workout. All in all it was a great trip. We met really friendly, interesting people. very relaxing trip. Its so easy- quick flight, no customs or passport, so I would recommend this for a quick getaway. However, it doesn't have the ultra luxurious feel you get from other Ritz's, so I wouldn't recommend this for honeymooners.

Our room was on the San Juan facing side and looked out onto the airport runway.

We stayed at the Ritz in St Thomas in December and were very happy with our experience. When our friends suggested a short vacation in San Juan I convinced everyone to stay at the Ritz. Each couple booked an Ocean View King Club Room. We each made a large deposit and had our confirmations. Upon arriving each of us was informed that there were no Ocean Club Rooms available. Everyone had an awful experience but I will tell you just about mine. Instead of spending our first afternoon on the beach we had to argue with the front desk about getting an accomodation. My husband and I are both attorneys and we were hoping that this would be a relaxing vacation with no arguments! The front desk finally offered us a \"junior suite\" facing the Airport with Club privileges. Their \"junior suite\" is actually just a slightly larger room with a bigger bathroom than their regular rooms. It books for a lesser rate than the Ocean View Club rooms. We decided to accept the room and try to relax for the rest of our trip. The next night at 11:00pm the front desk tracked us down in the Club Room Lounge to tell us that we had to move from our 9th floor room to the 4th floor in a dingy room overlooking a roof and above a noisy party room. The reason they gave us was that our 9th floor room was a \"connecting\" room and they needed it for a family arriving the next day. Needless to say we were very upset and returned to our room to discuss our options--such as moving to the El San Juan. That's when we realized that our room was NOT a connecting room! The front desk had deliberately lied to us. When we confronted them about their lie--they backed down and told us to keep the room. When we finally checked out at the end of our very stressful stay we discovered that the Ritz had billed us the higher rate of the Ocean View Club room which we never got! In fairness I have to say that they have promised to change our bill and to make an accomodation for our troubles, however, we are still waiting to see that happen. The unacceptable booking problems at this Ritz are a terrible shame. We were not the only group that had problems with their room bookings; it seemed that the Ritz had grossly overbooked their higher level rooms. The Club Lounge and Club staff are wonderful and the pool and beach are lovely.

I have stayed at many Ritz Carlton properties before and these aspects of our stay definitely lived up to Ritz standards. The Negatives: Yes the rooms are luxurious, well kept and clean, and have all the amenities of a 5 star hotel, however, they do not make you feel like you are at the beach. These rooms are decorated as if they could be practically anywhere and don't open-up to nature. It seems that Ritz Carltons tend to do this while Four Seasons usually make their properties fit with the environment and location better. Although in this setting (a built-up beach) there isn't really anything to open-up to. The Ritz definitely feels more like a hotel rather than a resort so it depends on what you are looking for.

As soon as we wake up in the morning, we head to the beach, where we stay for most of the day, ordering cocktails and lunch to eat by the ocean. In the evening we take a taxi to Old San Juan to try a local restaurant for dinner and look out over the fort before the sun goes down. Aside from the beautiful location of the hotel on the beach and the relaxing atmosphere, one of the reasons we keep coming back is the generous and consistent hospitality offered by the staff. They really do their best to make you feel welcome.

The hotel is very close to the airport, with a $10.00 cab fare, this would be a great hotel if you had to over-night in San Juan for an airline connection. Arrival at the hotel was very typical of a Ritz-Carlton, a friendly greeting, assistance with luggage and a prompt escort to the reception desk. Front desk staff very helpful, but they do try and upgrade you away from their \"city view\" rooms, which are honestly a view of the tacky apartment building next door. We paid about $500.00 per night on a package rate (arranged by the host of the party and did include taxes), but were not interested in spending more money for a pool view (which I always find to be loud anyway). The room: Not your typical Ritz-Carlton resort room. The room was strangely very Marriott (I know, they're owned by Marriott), and didn't have many of those special touches that you come to expect at R.C. The bathroom was very R.C. with plenty of towels, mirrors, etc. All-in-all the room was very plain and not very luxurious at all. We went to Mares restaurant and sat in the outside open air portion of the restaurant (close to the pool) to get a \"quick\" bite to eat after our flight. After about 15 minutes, we were finally brought menus. We ordered two cocktails, one Cobb Salad and one order of fish tacos. Another 15 minutes went by, drinks finally arrived and soon afterwards, our lunch. Two more gin and tonics later, the bill arrived. Trust me, you'll want the extra cocktails here, because the bill total was $87.00. Okay, it's an island and things need to be imported, but salad and tacos? We almost had to leave without paying because there was no one to pick up the check and credit card after 25 minutes. You are NOT paying for service at Mare's. Also, breakfast here gives new meaning to an \"eye opener\", beacuse a buffet will set you back $67.00 for two. Two gin and tonics poolside? That's $26.00 please. I was starting to think I may have been better of just sending an expesive gift to the birthday girl and called it a day..... I also hate the standard 10% resort fee that EVERY resort seems to change these days, but you will also find a $2.00 maid fee for each night also thoughtfully included in your final bill. Each day our rooms were not freshened until way after 3:00pm, I wonder if the fee was $4.00, would you receive better service? The bottom line is that the resort is nice, but service very flawed. If you're used to the R.C. in Naples, Amelia Island, Cayman Islands or Palm Beach (all of which I have been to), you will be very dissapointed in this resort. You are simply nickel and dimed for services that any of the above mentioned R.C. would provide, not only free of charge, but without hesitation, knowing that the cost of your room is the fee you pay for an outstanding experience.

We had a great time and the Ritz was nice. Since I had read a lot of posts prior to my trip, I tried to keep mental notes during my trip so I could provide up to minute information about the property and its offerings. First of all, I have been lucky to be spoiled by other Ritz properties (along with other luxury hotel chains) in other cities. So I like to think that I have a decent sampling of properties in order to judge this hotel. Also, I spend some time each year in Las Vegas, so I have pretty good knowledge of casinos. So here it goes.... The Ritz is right by the airport. So it is nice when you are on a limited \"sun budget\" that you can roll right off the tarmac and into a chaise lounge. It cost 3 people $12(total) to take a taxi from the airport. You do not hail a taxi at the airport, there are people that will be wearing bright orange polo shirts who will call a taxi for you. They will ask your destination and tell you the cost. This was a little confusing but ended up being a nice little service. Just look for the little desk and the orange shirts. The property is smallish but impressive with a nice fountain and large entrance. It is about 100-200 yards off of a main intersection. But traffic noise and the such is never a problem. Check- in is nice and the room was ready for us upon our arrival. We were in Room 433 and had a view of a neighboring buliding. (I did not request anything special) and wanted an economy rate. So we were not disappointed with the room's view. The room was clean. The age of the hotel shows a bit through some very small signs of wear and tear but overall okay. No real complaints with the room, our safe did not work, but that was about it. The room has a nice (40\" or thereabouts) flat screen television with normal US cable programming. I had communicatied to the Ritz via email that it was our 10th Wedding anniversary and upon arrival to the room, there was a delicious chocolate dessert awating us with HAPPY ANNIVERSARY written in chocolate across the plate. Very nice! Housekeeping was very good with morning and turndown service daily. The maids were all very friendly and stayed busy. The casino is sub-par. On Vegas standards, this casino would not make it a day, but since it is one of the few on the island it gets business. It is very small despite the fact that it is touted as the largest in the caribbean. Whoover came up with that fact must not think the the Atlantis is in the caribbean. Anyway, the casino is amusing with $5 craps, $2 roulette and a number of blackjack, Let It Ride, and Stud Poker tables. Most of the machines are penny and nickel slots so if you are a big limit player, this is not your place. The casino, like all casinos on the island are non-smoking and there are no bottles allowed in the casino. All beers are served in plastic cups. One night we ventured down to the El San Juan. It is a five minute walk from door to door. This casino is much more lively and the enviornment is like a happening night club. There is a Texas style bbq restaurant on the top of El San Juan that is a nice place to grab a drink and look out over the city and airport. I would recommend the El San Juan casino for the more demanding gambler or for the younger crowd looking for a party atmosphere. It was fun. The Italian restaurant La Piccola Fontana, or something like that, was very good. It seems that the pool at the Ritz is the main attraction with less interest in the beach. We did both and liked them both. I guess I favored the pool a little more just as it was easy to roll out of the chair and cool off in the crystal clear pool waters. The beach is not a postcard beach of the caribbean. The sand is not white and fluffy and the water is greenish not the sparkling blue that you may dream about. But the beach is a little less crowded and a place where a group of 4 could all sit together. A quick tip is to get out to the pool early for the best seating. The best pool chairs, for all-day sun ,are near the entrance to the beach with your chairs facing the hotel. Get the chairs closest to the pool and you will cook all day long. Its nice. Watch out for the iguanas that may take a dip in the pool on hot days. they are really cool and great fodder for your camara. Either place the drink service is a bit slow. A few times we would get up and walk to the outside bar to get our drinks. Regardless the drinks are extremely expensive. While I was not surprised by the cost b/c other travelers had warned me, it adds up fast at 6.50 for a beer and 13.00+ for a fruity drink. Because of the cost, the slower service, and my thirst, I walked down to a grocery store , Fresh Food, that is across from the entrance to the Intercontinental (about 10 minutes) and bought beers by the six pack. A case of 10 oz cans of Coors Light was still over $30, but what a savings. I had stashed a soft cooler in my luggage and just filled it up with beer and ice from the ice machine and voila! Noone seem surprised or said anything to me while I cracked open a beer by the pool but I did not draw attention to myself by pouring the beer into a Ritz cup. I think a few other travelers were envious of my lower cost solution. By the way, if you are a beer drinker, try the Medalla. Its the home brew of PR and is very, very good. You can also easily find Coors Light, Miller Light, Corona, and Heineken. Presidente is also a very good Pilsner from the Dominican Republic. Try it! Whoever said that they could not hear the planes from the airport must have been totally deaf, or they never stepped foot outside. You can hear the planes taking off all of the time. But it really was not that big of a deal. You cannot hear anything from inside the property. We tried and loved BLT in the Ritz. This is a steakhouse chain out of New York and is kind of trendy/upscale. My group of four sat at the bar and ordered dinner. We had a blast!!! Melissa, Roberto, and another bartender whose name i forgot, were awesome. The food was very good and the portions are big enough to split. My wife and I split a filet and were satisifed. I also liked the Wedge(salad), the mashed potatoes, and the spinach. Their appetizers are also excellent with many fresh treats like King Crab claws, Oysters, and shrimp. It is expensive, especially if you are drinking alcohol. But everywhere in the tourist areas will be that way. We really liked this place. One other excursion was a trip to the parrot club in Old San Juan. It is on Fortelza street which has a lot of places for bar hopping. The P-club is touristy. The food is pretty good but the service is painstakingly slow. I am a good, paitient diner, but at one point I got up to ask our server if something was the matter (I thought he had forgotten about us). I would suggest that you hit somewhere else. Marmalade is right up the street and is a cool lounge with a funky atmosphere. We would probably go back there instead. The cab from the ritz to Old San Juan was about $20-$25 for 4 people. Cabs are abundant at all times in the tourist areas. Overall, the people of San Juan are what made the trip. The servers, beach employees, and staff all seem young and happy. They are truly glad that you are there. Everyone is kind and helpful. That is one thing that PR has going for it over some of the other islands I have been. There is noone there trying to hustle you and just about everyone speaks perfect american English. The Ritz has a lot going for it and we liked it. It is not a place that we would recommend for a final destination for a long vacation but if you are looking for a quick get-away and can spend a little extra cash, then this may be a good spot. If you are planning a trip that takes you through Puerto Rico then this would be a good spot for an add-on day.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwalk,Ct.", "Title": "\u201cA very relaxing time\u201d", "Author": "kidsandcats", "ReviewID": "UR13317102", "Content": "My husband and I just got back from the Ritz Carlton in San Juan and we had a great time.

I cannot remember being so relaxed for a long time. We stayed in a club floor room, which was WELL worth it! The concierge staff on the club floor are excellent--very friendly, accomodating and attentive--they were truly amazing. And the food that is offered in the club is wonderful, there was always a plentiful display of all sorts of great meals up there and the wine and drinks flowed freely all evening. It was a great place to grab some peaceful time out of the sun or do work on the computer (free wifi). Kudos to the Ritz on a club lounge that is well staffed and well done. The weather while we were in Puerto Rico was perfect. We lucked out as the day we left it was rainy...but we had 7 days of pure sunshine, usually no clouds in the sky and a wonderful ocean breeze on the beach. The staff at the pool and beach were very helpful in setting up chairs and umbrellas wherever you wished when you asked. The first day I just asked for towels and found my own seats but I quickly caught on that you need to ask to have them set up your chairs and then you get vip treatment. The pool wasnt heated and could be quite cool in the am, but heated up by afternoon and was very refreshing. The beach here is BEAUTIFUL--I had never been and was very impressed with the fine white sand and cleanliness and the beautiful waves. One of the best assets of the entire hotel is BLT Steak--this restaurant is SUPERB! WE ate here 4 times in one week and had fabulous meals every time! They have a great bar area--the service was immpeccable and the food fantastic. Cannot recommend it enough. Also, this hotel is within walking distance of other hotels that also have casinos and restaurants (el san juan and intercontinental are 5 minute walk) and some other little restaurants that are casual...so there are options to explore. It is also an easy cabride into Old San Juan for dinner or sightseeing (20 minutes)...dont miss the forts! The fact that this hotel is so close to the airport is a plus as far as I am concerned. You cannot hear the planes from inside the hotel at all and on the beach once in awhile you hear a plane but not often--there is such a breeze and the waves are so high that it drowns it out. But being able to get to the hotel in 5 minutes and a 13$ cab ride is great! Especially when you are trying to get to the airport the day of departure...you dont have to leave an hour before, you know. My only complaint is with the housekeeping service. Sometimes it was great and sometimes terrible, and I just expect more from a Ritz Carlton. One day they just skipped our room altogether even though we had not been in the room all day--we called and they still didnt come for a long time. The turndown service was also very inconsistent in terms of time and what they would actually do. We had to call another night because they skipped turndown and we needed towels and it still took them a half hour to get towels to us. There is no button on the phone for housekeeping which struck me as strange--you have to go through guest services so I dont know if the chain of communication is very good. Anyway, this is the only area I think they need to work on.

Our impression of the hotel, generally, is that it is quite nice, and up to the \"Ritz\" standard. We were left somewhat disappointed with our room. We requested, and received, a room on the club level with a balcony overlooking the ocean. The rate was $1900/nt. The problems were as follows: 1) The size of the room was no larger than a standard room. We knew in advance what the rate was, so there is no complaint there. We just thought that for this rate we should have a more substantial amount of space; 2) Our room was infested with ants. Don't ask me why this is not our number one complaint. Nonetheless, it was frustrating. We contacted the hotel who replied, (not joking) \"What would you like us to do?\" We asked them to send up an exterminator. They did, however, the ants returned in force; 3) The Ritz charged us a 10% per day resort fee. This meant an additional $190/nt to use the hotel's facilities. This really irked me for some reason. I would rather they simply raised the room rate by an equal amount. Does a family of four staying in a $400/nt room really use 1/5 the facilities that my wife and I used during our two night stay? This just felt like it was unnecessary gouging. I did not complain about this charge, so I do not know what the management's position is on the matter. Now for the really good. Eveybody at this property went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They are truly warm friendly people who took every opportunity to try to please us. We really appreciated their hospitality. The pool area was clean and a great place to fall asleep while my wife was out spending money ( er, sightseeing, I mean).

The pool staff was eager to help and the beach was relaxing and very clean. i don't know how people complain about this hotel.

Upon arrival in our room, I called and requested foam pillows and they came with them quickly. Then, the front desk called to make sure that we had received them and that they were satisfactory. 3. A staff member saw my husband getting on the elevator and rushed onto the elevator to ask my husband which floor and push the buttons for him. 4. At the pool, we asked a staff member to take a photo of us in the pool. Then when he had, I went to get it back with a slightly wet hand and he said, Oh no, please, let me take it back to your chair.

BLT Steak (NY) great steak and tuna tartare and finally the Thursday night seafood buffet Ritz Carlton Style fantastic. The pool area was very nice,watch out for the 3 huge iguanas that live in the brush near the pool. They don't bother you and they rarley come out plus the kids got a kick out of them.

I spoke to the front desk they assured me it wouldn't happen again and asked me when I wanted the room cleaned and turned down they never ever got it right. Not Ritz Carlton Service.

We traveled with three children (twins who are 2 and daughter who is 4 1/2). Contrary to some other reviews I read, the beach was VERY nice. Soft sand and clean water. There were one or two days where seaweed washed on the beach. I was surprised the staff didn't clean it up, but it didn't really affect our beach experience. The pool was HUGE, but we only dipped our feet in it because it wasn't heated (or if it was, it was freezing). There were WAY too many pool chairs around so it was almost impossible to get from Point A to Point B. We traveled on a non-vacation week, so maybe there is a need for a lot of chairs during peak travel time, but in off peak, it was too crowded at the pool area with chairs. Unfortunately, it was VERY windy while we were there and in fact, there was a tropical storm one day. One thing I was disappointed with was that there were no shelter areas on the beach or pool. If you were on the beach with your kids and it started to pour (which it did a few times while we were there), you had to grab your kids, your bags and run off the beach, through the ridiculously crowded maze of pool chairs and into the hotel. It's pretty far, especially with kids, to get inside the hotel for shelter. And who wants to stand dripping wet in the fancy hotel lobby? Thus, it would have been nice to have small shelters to stand under during the rainy periods. On the one day it rained, there were NO activities for kids, other than the KIdz Club. But Kidz Club is for kids 5 and up, so I couldn't really bring my twins in there, although I did for a bit just because there was nothing to do with them. I sent them in with my babysitter (who I brought from home) but was still charged for babysitting time. Kind of weird. My daughter loved the kids club, but she was the only one who attended and she sat inside the whole morning doing arts and crafts. That was fine because she loves that kind of stuff, but I was surprised they kept the kids inside so much when it was sunny out. It's possible they stayed inside because that's what my daughter wanted to do. Not sure. Other than the kids club, there are really no activities for kids. No arcades, no water slides, etc... Because the weather wasn't great and the pool was so cold, we actually put the kids in the outdoor hot tub a few times (although probably not the best thing for little kids). The kids actually enjoyed it because it wasn't too hot. The accomodations (rooms) were really very nice. We had adjoining rooms overlooking the pool and ocean. The room was clean and spacious. Large bathrooms. I would have liked a bit more drawer space, though, since I had tons of clothes for the kids. The restaurants were very good too. We loved BLT Steak (went there 3 times!). Il Mulino was a mixed bag. Great appetizers,but I didn't like my entree at all (some chicken dish recommended by the waiter). My kids had no problems finding food to eat. The buffet at breakfast had lots of things they enjoyed and we ate at the same place for dinner most nights. One night we went to the El San Juan (down the street) for hibachi. The biggest problem we had was with the management. Everyone was VERY friendly, but just not at all knowledgeable. When I checked in, I asked about signing up for the kids club. The front desk didn't know anything about the club. She didn't know when it started, how to sign up, the cost etc... No one answered the phone at the kids club either, despite the fact that it was the middle of the day. A package was inadvertently sent to our room and it took two full days for someone to pick it up. We needed milk for the kids before going to bed and they charged $5 per glass. The gym was very nice. They had exercise equipment and different classes. The spa seemed nice, but I had a stone massage for $220 and it was not very good at all. I've had hot stone massages elsewhere and this just didn't compare in the slightest, especially for the hefty price tag. I know some reviewers complained about the airport being so close. That didn't bother us at all (of course, our room didn't overlook the airport!) You could somewhat hear the plane noise on the beach, but the ocean wave sound really drowned out the plane sounds. So that wasn't an issue at all for us. We rented a car from Enterprise in the hotel one day and that worked out really well. The rain kind of put a damper on part of the vacation. The day of the tropical storm, there was NOTHING to do, except go to the casino (which we couldn't do with the kids, obviously). I tried to go to the gym, but had to walk outside to get to it, which was not fun in the torrential rain. All in all, we had a nice time, but I think next time we'd go for a hotel that was a little more kid friendly and that had a heated pool. I think a lot of our disappointment was more with the weather than with the hotel.", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel experience to date\u201d", "Author": "kimspokane", "ReviewID": "UR12196869", "Content": "We were at the Ritz five days prior to christmas in a concierge pool view room. Our stay at the Ritz made our subsequent christmas cruise all the more underwhelming. The most impressive part of our stay was the genuine helpful attitude of the staff. Every single staff member that we encountered during our stay made a point of saying good morning and greeting us, often by name. Our two teen daughters were attached to us for the first couple of days. One of the managers, Ramon, took us and our family on a personal tour of areas of the hotel that may be of some interest for our children to hang out. Anticipating the fact that families were traveling together for christmas they set up two large rooms for the kids and teens. One showing christmas movies with bean bag chairs, big screen tv, pop, chips, popcorn machine and an adjoing room set up with play stations, wi games, xbox all with big screen tv's. They had these rooms staffed and the staff gave the kids 1:1 time showing them how to play the games and actually playing with them. LaLa was incredible. She was able to engage our teens and even asked if we wanted her to keep them occupied for a certain amount of time so the adults could have some kid free time. This program was a no cost extra and not part of the kids program. Just one example of how the hotel went to extra lengths to ensure family holiday stays were enjoyable for kids, teens and adults and another example of how the Ritz goes a step beyond. The food was incredible and we are very picky about good food. The food and service in the concierge lounge was a perfect 10. In the afternoons the pool staff delivered complimentary fruit smoothies while we layed in the sun. Food and drinks are expensive but on par with any 4 and five star resort. The grounds are very beautiful. The beach was cleaned daily and there was pleanty of space for chairs, umbrellas, shade or sun. Plane noise was only noticed one afternoon for about 5 min at 2pm on the beach. Must have been a bunch of planes landing or taking off. You can't see them as their path must be away from the Ritz. I walked to the Marriott a ways down the beach one day just to check it out. The plane noise was very noticeable there. The ocean is not the blue blue that you see at the Ritz in St. Thomas or eagle beach in Aruba but it was just right for us and there were pleanty of people swimming. Surf lessons are offered just to the right of the ritz on the beach where the waves have a bigger break. Nightly music was offered in the lobby. Some excellent local music. The spa was not crowded and spa staff very helpful. A couple more examples of service; Our kids wanted to watch a dvd movie in the room. They could not figure out how to get the dvd player to work. My husband called for assistance. I walked into the room and thought there had been some sort of incident. Two uniformed men were in the room to show the kids and my husband how to work the dvd player. The following day one of them called us to see if we were having any further problems or needed any additional help. My daughter was horsing around in the pool and her face met the bottom of the pool causing some scrapes to her nose, forehead and lip. She was embarrassed and immediately wanted to go back to her room. A janitor saw us enter the room with her crying. He was concerned and called for help. Staff responded and two first aid people came up to fix her up and see if I wanted a doctor. Her injuries were to her ego more than face. The staff repeatedly asked me if there was anything they could do to help her feel better, ice cream... and they were genuine. She was embarrassed about being in public and so we ate dinner in the concierge lounge. Wanda went to her mother's house the next day and brought in a large fresh stalk of Aloe Vera plant. She even cut up individual peices and put in a baggie on ice for individual application. This really helped the scrapes heal fast. Even the janitor in the hall asked me how my daughter was doing. My husband usually gets a little stir crazy staying at a resort but he had an excellent relaxing time as well and we did not look forward to leaving for our cruise. The casino offers poker with a $100 buy in no limit bets. He had a lot of fun playing with the locals who were very friendly. We did not leave the resort prior to the cruise. Post cruise we stayed in old san juan which was a lot of fun. We wish we would have seen more of Puerto Rico but now have more exploring to do upon our return. Other guests during our stay were vacationing with family and extended family. It it seemed to me to be a holiday destination vacation for the majority of guests. A good majority of the children were accompanied by a nanny, or more than one attentive nannie and so unruly kids were not running around. The cost of the rooms was much higher due to christmas vacation but I feel that despite the much higher cost, the Ritz was by far the best money and value for our vacation dollar because they delivered exactly the kind of vacation we were looking for. We spent far more on the christmas cruise than we did on the concierge room stay at the Ritz and in retrospect wish we had never left the Ritz. We will definately return to Puerto Rico and stay at the Ritz. When on vacation we typically spend the extra to stay at a four or five star resort. We also typically book a suite. We opted for the concierge level room vs. a suite for this stay. I think the suites ran around 6k per night for holiday stay. Despite the fact that we did not have a balcony or suite we still had the most enjoyable tropical stay that we have had at any resort. This was due to the service. I think when we return we will stay off season when we can afford a suite. The Ritz in St. Thomas and Maui are also great. The service at the San Juan Ritz is what sets this resort apart. My daughter's face and ego have recovered. We returned home last night. We were excited to get home to our own house and beds after 24 hours in flights and airport time. The min. we walked outside the airport to 16 degree temps and snow we all quickly agreed that we wished we were still in Puerto Rico and the Ritz.

We were able to get into the room around 3:00 pm. To our surprise, we were upgraded to a very nice garden suite, which was valued at $1500 plus the 10% resort fee. The room we booked was an ocean view room for $409 per night plus the resort fee. The garden suite was on the first floor and had a living room, dining room, kitchenette, guest bathroom, master bathroom and master bedroom. In addition there was a private terrace and pool access directly from the room. All this space totaled 1200 square feet. The bed was very comfortable and had frette linens with a goose down mattress cover and blanket. The bathrooms had Bulgari toiletries. I only have one negative comment: the dinning room window was very very dirty and should be cleaned promptly. If I were paying full price for the room, I would be extremely disappointed at that. The pool was very nice and had excellent service. The attendees offered to set up your lounge chair each morning and also provided food and drink service from the Ocean Grill. In addition, there was complimentary water, coffee (in the morning), cold towels and smoothie samples provided throughout the day. I was a little disappointed with the beach, which is mostly due to Mother Nature rather than the hotel. There was seaweed on the shore and the water was not bright blue like some of the other Caribbean islands. Nonetheless, the hotel still offered beachside service, chairs and water sports. The hotel has a number of dining options for dinner: Il Mulinos, BLT Steak and Mares. We only ate at the first two restaurants. Il Mulinos is a nice, expensive Italian restaurant. While the restaurant received high ratings, we found the food to be standard Italian fare at inflated prices. Ravioli was $40 a plate and was nothing special. You should only eat at Il Mulinos if you have exhausted the other options provided by the hotel and IslaVerde/San Juan. BLT Steak, on the other hand, was excellent. I ordered the American Wagyu steak, which was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and was very tender. Prior to the main course, an excellent puffy cheese popover was offered with butter and sea salt. For the dessert, we had a crepe souffl\u00c3\u00a9 which I would highly recommend. Overall, I would rate this hotel very highly. The staff went out of their way to make our stay special.

And you can't beat the poolside pack and plays! Great touch. The hotel overall was the perfect choice for us - just five minutes from the airport (huge plus when traveling with a baby) - with an amazing pool and easy access to a well-kept beach. There are babysitting services as well although we didn't use them. Hotel is in walking distance to a Walgreens and other stores if you need snacks, prescriptions, baby supplies or food, sunscreen, etc. The food at the resort is very good, and we are picky picky eaters! Due to the operating hours, we ate at Mares, lobby lounge and the Ocean Bar only; all were great. Room service though was our favorite - loved the seafood pasta and banana trifle so much we ordered it for three nights! Overall, service was outstanding, and we really appreciated the warm smiles and helpful attitudes even on Christmas Day when I'm sure the staff would have preferred not to be working. We have stayed at several Ritz properties over the years and this property certainly lives up to the reputation. My only suggestions (very minor) would be to put in a railing on the stepped entrance to the beach (a little slippery, especially when carrying baby), offering more local spices/coffee/arts&crafts for sale in the gift shop, and expanding the hours of BLT and Il Mulino (starting dinner times of 6 pm were too hard with the baby - would have loved a 5 pm dinner or a more casual lunch option so we could try those places).

We wanted to stay for 4 days ashore before flying back to the UK and as the cruise ended in San Juan our pals booked the Ritz Carlton assuring us that we would be mightily impressed with the service and facilities, but that did not quite work out. The room and the room service was fine - we particularly liked the tea and coffee box in the room which allowed us to please ourselves when and how we started and finished a day. The rooms (and even the building) seemed dated although this did not affect the stay and of course there is only so much you can do to modernise a hotel before you have to start again! The pool was fine however unless it was toward the end of the day when most people had left we had to chase waiters to get a poolside drink as they only made very rare trips poolside and usually only if someone (often me) had walked to the pool bar/restaurant to order drinks in the first place. This seemd odd as there were plenty of staff in, around and by the bar chatting and joking while a handful of guests had chosen to eat/drink there. Beach was fine but I don't like the concept of various surfboards/rafts/dinghys etc being included in our 'resort fee' when we did not want to use them. The restaurants were all good although the Steak restaurant by the casino was very confused. We were shown to our table and my wife requested a cushion as she is only 5 ft tall and her seat was too low to be comfortable when eating. The head waiter said that they had none and he was sorry so I suggested one be obtained from the nearby lobby/lounge but I was ignored. So i fetched one myself and explained that it really did not take much and I was surprised that no-one was prepared to do this for me. Shoulders were shrugged and it seemed that I had asked for the impossible. By this time our table had been descended upon by what seemed like a dozen people to bring us water, bread, canapes, menus, wine lists, specials, olive oil & balsamic vinegar and so on. By this time we had to remove the table decorations to get it all on the table - no, seriously! When the food was served the portions were simply immense and one meal could have fed us all. I am used to large portions in the States and her islands but this was ridiculous and I felt embarrased at the waste. The cost was $600 for the 4 of us and we had just a starter and main - no dessert. The wine we ordered was not expensive and by experience we all thought that it was unduly expensive and could have cost much less with reduced portions. The other 2 restaurants were far more sensible and overall we enjoyed the experience very much. In my opinion the hotel could do with another bar where there is more seating and perhaps a pianist as the lobby bar is a little impersonal and usually full of conference delegates.

Yes, the drinks and food are expensive but the quality is outstanding. Go to Denny's down the street if you want it on the cheap. The concierge at the Ritz is happy, happy to recommend other, less pricely restaurants and they have a huge book of menus at the desk for restaurants around the city. But the BLT Steakhouse was phenomental and if you think about what you spend on cab fare it isn't that much (I had a Kobe beef cheeseburger for $22 that included pre-dinner bread and rosemary infused french fries).

The rooms at this hotel aren't all that special, but the service is 5-star. You will often be greeted by name. All of our requests were taken care of. Room service was on time and exactly as ordered. The coffee is great. I like that each \"department\" in this hotel asks what other kinds of services you need. For example, when you call room service at night for coffee the next day, they ask if you need a wake-up call. If you set up a wake-up call, they ask if you want room service for breakfast. Club Level: Club level cost about $200 extra per night during our trip. Because room service, hotel food, and drinks are quite costly, $200 for us to have access to the club lounge was well worth it. Brandon, the concierge, was absolutely incredible, as were Wanda and the rest of the club level staff. He took great care of us, and the personalized service was really nice. It's good to have a place right on the same floor as your room to get good coffee, read the paper, check email, and, of course, drink and snack at five daily food presentations. We met a lot of great people in the club lounge, too. The Beach and Pool: Well-manicured. The pool was clean. There were enough chairs and umbrellas to go around, and the staff take care of setting you up with chairs and towels. The beach was average--not perfectly white sand and clear water, but nice. They also have hammocks. We took a Hobie Cat ride (included in the resort fee) with their captain, and that was a lot of fun. They have bartenders that come around to get drink orders, plus staff that offer cold towels and small cups of lemon ice when it's hot out. I found the experience of hanging out by the pool and beach very relaxing and stress-free. The Spa: We did not get any treatments, but did use the indoor whirlpool and sauna, which were great. Other reviewers mentioned staff coming in and out of the area. We only saw one staffer come in to make sure we had what we needed and throw water on the coals. The locker-rooms are very clean, well-stocked with towels and toiletries, and the attendant is nice. The Gym: Small, crowded before dinnertime, but fine. The lobby: Fairly small and understated compared with the Vegas-style El San Juan nearby, but hopping on weekends with Latin music and dancing. Attentive bartenders. Drinks are steep--$14-$16 for mojitos. Casino: Typical of San Juan. Fairly small. Plenty of low-stakes machines and tables for gambling wimps like me. BLT Steak: Excellent food and service. The best bartenders anywhere. Check-out: Very easy. A note on the crazy mini-bar lady: A prior reviewer's comment that the mini-bar lady is obnoxious did ring true! She barged in immediately after knocking, and did this to another guest that we met. She did this to me after I told her less than an hour earlier that we did not need her services. Ask for a Do Not Disturb sign upon check-in. The staff will honor this the entire time and no one will knock; this is the best defense! (In case hotel staff read this, we actually met two mini-bar people. Only one was actually intrusive.) Other reviewers have commented that this property does not live up to the Ritz name. In terms of service, staff got it right and went above and beyond to make us happy. I can see how some might not feel the rooms are posh enough, but then the price for standard rooms ($239) was actually very reasonable.

There were dirty glasses in the room when we checked in, the door was very difficult to shut (the door trim was misaligned), the bathroom lighting was very dim, the water pressure in the shower was very weak, and the beds were soft and lumpy. Room service was offered 24 hours a day - but the selection was very limited. We stayed for 3 nights, and had housekeeping service on the second day. We had used one of the glasses for coffee, and noticed that they simply rinsed it and put it back in its original place, rather than replacing the glass! The safe was an odd shape - tall but not very deep. It reminded me of a bathroom medicine cabinet without shelves. So, we had to stack things carefully and close the door quickly, before everything toppled out of it. On a more positive note, the complimentary bottled water was a nice touch - very convenient.

Please forgive my delay in posting but upon returning home on 11/04, I caught a bad cold. My stay was absolutely fantastic. I wrote the GM 'before' I left to advise it was the best trip of my life - and I travel personally at least 4 times a year. All staff were very helpful, courteous and friendly. They were informative about the hotel, the city and the Island. This trip was a graduation present to myself for 2 MBA's. Staff at the Ritz pampered me - correction - they made me feel like a queen. I felt as if it was my home away from home and I was sad to leave. Never have I been on a vacation and been 'sad' to leave. Kudos to 'all' staff and I do mean 'all'. Of special note are staff I consider my friends - Ramon, Frances, Ivan, Roberto, Rafael, Hosea, Isis and Benjamin. I cannot wait to return. This hotel is absolutely gorgeous and I have posted some (of the 200) pics alone I took inside and outside of the hotel. Note - these pics are dated correctly but the time is off. I was upgraded to Concierge level - if there is anyway you can afford it, I highly recommend this floor and level of service. It has five food presentations a day, drinks, computer with Internet access and a breathtaking view of the pool and ocean as you relax on its balcony. Although I don't drink, one of my newfound friends made me several rum punches without the rum daily. He not only gave me the recipe, but took it one step further and allowed me to watch him make me one so that I'd be sure to know how to do it. You also must eat at BLT. You also must eat at BLT. You also must eat at BLT. Excuse me, have I said you must eat at BLT. Your stay at the Ritz will not be complete unless you eat at BLT. I had the bacon appetizer, ribeye and potatoes augratin. I tasted the crabcakes, braised short ribs and grilled asparagus. Everything was the best and this coming from someone who has eaten at more than half of the top 10 steakhouses of America on both polls. Chicago is known for its steakhouses, we had Magnum's and continue to have Gene & Georgetti's, the Chicago Chop House, etc., Morton's, Lawry's, Ruth Chris, Keefers, etc. Yet I still say, you 'must' eat at BLT. During my stay, I went on tours daily arranged by the Ritz via Castillo Tours. I loved that all three days I had the same driver, Tony. He was absolutely wonderful, 'extremely' informative and has a great sense of humor. By the end of the third day as we said goodbye (he dropped me off at the cruise terminal), I'd found another friend. Tony subs with Castillo so I asked him for his email address because when I do return, I want him as my driver/guide regardless of whether he is still subbing with Castillo.

We tried to book a night at the Marriott, but they were full. Thank goodness, because it allowed us to try the Ritz. We arrived at 1:00 on the 2nd and were immediately greeted. Bags wisked away while we went to check-in. We did not expect our room to be ready (a garden view - the least expensive) because of the time of our arrival. What was surprising is that they apologized the room was not ready and gave us a free lunch food voucher at the Ocean Bar and Grill. We went to the wrong restaurant and were not directed where to go - but WALKED directly to the restaurant where they immediately seated us at the location of our choice by the beach. We were told to order as much food as we wanted - it was free except for alcohol. We split a shrimp cocktail and a dessert + we each ordered a main course. I had the Grouper Sandwich and my hubby had a cobb salary with lobster. Our total lunch bill was $89 and it was FREE!!! The food and service were wonderful and we would have happily paid the cost of the lunch, but it was very nice that it was free. They called me on my cell phone when the room was ready. We were upgrated to a ocean & pool view with balcony. Room nicely appointed - very comfortable bed and pillows! Since this was a one night stay over due to our cancelled flight, we did not experience much of PR. One thing I did notice that was scary and comforting all at the same time - the number of police on the beach on horse back and ATV's. I wanted to walk the beach in the morning and asked at the front desk if it was safe. I was assured it was. As soon as I hit the beach I noticed an officer on ATV staying close enough away, but at the same time, watching to ensure I remained safe. He rode ahead of me and checked tree's and other wood structures to ensure no issues. I really enjoyed the walk knowing he was close by. It is a shame a tourist cannot walk the beach safely without police, but at the same time - I was very glad he was there. Typical in Ritz style - they remember your name and address you by it. They bring around nice cold snacks at the pool and beach. Someone was always available to help and assist. The service was by far more than we expected at this PR location. I can't close without commenting on our dinning experience at Mares. Exceptional dinner & service. We didn't order alcohol - and our total food bill was $78 - worth every penny!! In fact, we thought it was low compared to mediocre meals we've had at other locations. Hubby had lobster tails and I had the grouper with mango salsa. Off the charts! From the moment we arrived to the time we left - this was a wonderful experience. For the price, in PR, you will find no other resort with this type of service and property. A comment on the Marriott - we went to the Marriott to check it out. It was definitely more crowded and loud. We didn't feel the property was up to the caliber of the Ritz; however, it was a nice property. We enjoyed the visit, but were very glad to get back to the Ritz. I wouldn't chose to vacation in PR, but since we travel through PR for other carribean islands - I would definitely book a night before and after our vacation at the Ritz. In fact, we pondered rescheduling our flight Friday to stay at the Ritz another night. My recommendation would be to spend 2 -3 nights at the Ritz to experience PR and to include this as a stop over on the way to or from another carribean island. One comment about the plane noise.

The room was a dissappointment. Light bulbs out, hole in the wall, toilet wouldn't flush completely and stains on the ceiling. We called and asked for the toilet to be repaired at a minimum which took 4 hours for somebody to show up. The gentleman said they were saving on pay so he was alone!!!!

I wanted to get this down while it was fresh in my mind. I just stayed at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ritz Carlton\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd San Juan for a week. To be fair, there were some good things about the hotel. The noise from airplanes that is often referred to on this site was not an issue. I heard one plane the whole time I was there. The grounds were amazing too. Tree ferns, beautiful fountains and palm trees were all over the place. It looked the part of the tropical get away. Now to the not so great things\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I want to let you all know that this hotel, while nice, should not be listed on the roster of Ritz Carlton properties. I found out during our stay that it is a privately owned Ritz Carlton and is franchised. The Ritz Carlton is supposed to be all about friendly world class service, at least the ones I have stayed at previously. This hotel is service with a scowl at its worst. On arrival, usually the staff at a Ritz Carlton will greet you and offer to take your bags. If the check in line is long, usually they will stow your luggage. No such luck here. We were forced to lug our 6 pieces of luggage into a line that almost stretched out of the door and the front desk person who was (the rudest person I have ever encountered at any hotel front desk, except at a little out of the way Howard Johnson at midnight in a snowstorm) took one look at my group of sweaty tired travelers and promptly told us that our rooms would not be ready for a while and that it was hotel policy to not let guests check in until the room was ready. If you want to know what she was like think the stewardess on Ben Stiller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plane ride on Meet The Parents. Yes, she is that bad! We asked for the manager and an equally rude individual reiterated her statement and then they started talking about us in Spanish not thinking that the stupid people in front of them could understand. I was very upset by this time and asked what other hotels were in the area because we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure that we wanted to stay at the Ritz any longer because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel welcome. True to his rude demeanor, he started listing other hotels for us to go to and even offered to call a cab for us. I felt that this reaction was another slap in the face. He should have apologized and offered to correct their initial disappointing reception. When we finally got checked in the nightmare continued. As soon as we opened the door, we were hit with a strange smell in our room that was very similar to vomit and several stains on the carpet that were suspicious. The shower curtain was mildewed and there was a large crack in the window of our room looking out to our view. The carpet was soaked too and the internet connection didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that I had paid three thousand dollars for this room. Also, the internet is not wireless in the rooms. It is an Ethernet connection that requires a plug. You have to sit at the desk to use it. Sort of inconvient but once again not up to what the Ritz is usually about. I called the front desk, housekeeping and the management office for help with the smell and room issues. Both hotel managers were on vacation, one until August 6th, over two weeks from when were to leave! I was equally disturbed to discover that the only manager on duty was the rude person mentioned above. What a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd start to our long anticipated vacation. I was able to find, after much searching, the guest relations manager who is a lovely woman named Flavia. She is such a sweet person. She listened to my concerns and offered to send an ozone machine up to our room help get rid of the smell. She also offered to move our room if we wanted but we had already unpacked. In addition, she gave us a credit to be used towards food at the hotel which was very nice but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for it. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like someone cutting you and then offering to pay for the stitches. Nice offer but why did it have to happen in the first place? The ozone machine didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help much but I was done by this point and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try to persue it any further.. The food at the hotel is not the best and drinks are outrageously expensive. A normal strawberry daiquiri (that pink drink that we all dream about while waiting to go on vacation) is $15 a pop! A Mojito (the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signature drink) is $16. The food at the main restaurant called Mare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is bland and extremely expensive too. Trust me! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan to eat or drink there if possible. There was a nice girl named Rosanne at the Mare restaurant that helped us and showed us around the hotel the first day. She was also a bright spot in the otherwise disappointing staff at the hotel and gave us some good tips about where to go for good nightlife. The hotel spa is very small. Get this, there is a staff entrance leading right into the area where the steam room and jacuzzi are located. It is used at least once every 30 seconds by the staff coming and going. When you are trying to relax in the spa, staff members are constantly coming in and out and have no concept of quiet. They are often talking loudly and rolling carts right through the Spa! I could not believe it. Not relaxing at all. The pool is 3ft. 6 inches deep at its deepest point. This makes for tough swimming for adults but good for kids I guess. The beach was nice but there were several homeless people on it begging for food and money which was disturbing. Keep in mind that most of Puetro Rico is very poor and the Ritz is one of three \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upscale\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotels in all of San Juan. I do not have any clue how they managed to get their 4 \u00c2\u00bd star rating. I have stayed at 3 star hotels that were better. Overall, I would say if you have low expectations, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about service and like the smell of vomit in your room or just want to get away, the Ritz is a good place to stay. It is a Ritz Carlton in name only. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s similar to a good looking Holiday Inn or a nice Best Western.

The staff here makes it so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to lift a finger. They set up your cushioned beach chairs, towels and umbrella wherever you like. The beach was never too crowded, even on the weekend. They even bring around cold wet towels and frozen lemonade samples from time to time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c these little luxuries definitely stood out!! LOCATION: The hotel is 10 minutes ($10 taxi ride) from the airport. I was a little concerned about the airplane noise after reading other reviews, but it really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us. There is not too much to do in the direct vicinity. We went into Old San Juan a few times, which was a gorgeous old city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice to just walk around. The only downfall was the high cost of taxis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 20 minute cab ride was $20 each way, which could get expensive. There is also a bus stop very close to the hotel. For 75 cents, it drops you off right in Old San Juan (the last stop), but does go through some not so nice areas. ROOM: We booked a city view room, ended up having a partial view of the ocean and the building next door. Regardless, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really matter because we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in our room all that much and there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a balcony. The room and bathroom were standard (on the smaller side, especially after staying at El Conquistador), the Bvlgari toiletries were nice. Nice, large flat screen TV! SERVICE: From the front desk to the housekeeping staff, to the beach and pool staff, to the restaurant staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the service at the Ritz-Carlton was 5 stars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we really felt pampered!! FOOD: The food at the hotel is very expensive, but very high quality, so totally worth it. We ate at both BLT Steak and Il Mulino in the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I HIGHLY recommend both places for both delicious food and wonderful atmosphere. Il Mulino is perfect for a romantic dinner. Being from NYC, we were very impressed with both. The breakfast buffet in the hotel was delicious \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth the $25. We ate in the Isla Verde area a couple of times \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once at Metropol (Cuban) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c popular local place, food was just okay. We also ate at Lupi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (Mexican) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the only thing good about it was the convenient location. In Old San Juan, we ate at Tantra \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they lured us in with the promise of a performance by a belly dancer, who never showed up (total scam!) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unfortunate, because that was the reason we chose that place over a few other cute places in the area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c food was just okay and rather expensive. We also ate at El Jibarito, which came highly recommended and had fantastic local Puerto Rican cuisine for a bargain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very casual, a must try. Overall, we found the food in Puerto Rico to be just okay (a lot of fried food)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they are known for their cuisine. ACTIVITIES: We went to the larger fort in Old San Juan, which was very cool and had beautiful views \u00e2\u20ac\u201c highly recommend. We went Scuba diving and to the bio-bay in Fajardo when staying at El Conquistador (prior to arriving at the Ritz).

We booked through my travel agent who went through Apple Vacations. We decided to upgrade to the Club Level that we had heard so many wonderful things about. So, ALL was prepaid before we even left on July 9th arrival..checkout on July 14. Upon arrival we were greeted very nicely..good start! So, now we are checking in and there was a problem. Somehow, there were two rooms booked...one for me and another for my daughter. Nope..we only booked one room. So this gliche took about 15 minutes to resolve..I gave them the vouchers that stated the room was PAID in full..one room!! Then, they asked for my credit card for \"incidental charges\". Thoughtout the 5 night stay we only charged 2 lunches and one sightseeing tour that amounted to a $175.00 charge to my credit card. Imagine my surprise when on the morning of checkout there is a bill for over $3000.00!!! I immediately went to the front desk asking for an explanation! Thank goodness I had brought the duplicate set of vouchers (receipts). They had to make copies of the duplicates Uh..where were the originals they took from me when we checked in? I was then told nothing could be done until 10am when the \"billing office\" opened. Three and a half hours later...the club lounge manager, Brandon, checked on this and said it was remedied. I checked out with a receipt for ONLY the $175.00 correct charge to the credit card. Imagine my surprise when I got home and was checking my credit card statement....uh huh...the Ritz Carlton had CHARGED my credit card for 5 full nights on the day of my check-in for the over $3000.00 charge. Even though the \"charges were pending\" I was outraged that my card had been charged for 5 nights AND it was a prepaid trip. This morning I called the RC and spoke to the finance department who was going to call my bank to have the charges reversed. As of my writing this...I am waiting for her phone call.

You can also get to 2 large malls within 15 minutes and the Belz outlet in about 30 mins (all dependant on traffic) I had a very good rate, though my company, which for the price I paid made the hotel very good value. I stayed in the normal room, facing the car park area. For about $40 a night I could have upgraded to a pool view, and if I had been on holidays there, I might have done it. Positives - Most friendly and helpful staff I have ever come across. Everyone from security, cleaners, front desk, restaurant staff are all friendly. Actually this seemed to be the trend in San Juan - Room had a nice large flat screen TV - Room was large, clean etc - Room ammenities were from Bvlgari and included everything you could want from shampoo, conditioner, sewing kit etc - great restaurants, especially BLT. Fantastic steak (but you pay for it!) - pool was really nice, easy to get a deck chair. - Right at the beach front Negatives - not really many. the only one (minor at that) was on weekend afternoons by the pool it is quite crowded. So not a lot of free space in the pool and a lot of noise depending on the crowd. I have read complaints about others about the airport, but this is not that distracting, you get use to it.

Then when you do get some informatoin you feel so happy that you don't realize they neglected to mention the most critical item that later comes back to screw you. In short, don't use them! Can't recommend BLT Steak highly enough - what a fantastic experience. Also liked Il Mulino though the Italian food is just a little too heavy for me and the wine list is quite a bit more expensive than the BLT menu. We did the rum tasting in the lobby lounge and the gentleman who helped us there was lovely - highly receommended if you want to learn more about rum and taste some great ones too.

I had been reading every review written here on trip advisor for the past 6 months. I figured most of the bad reviews were overexaggerated because it sounded like a wonderful place. I was expecting all the great things that all the other reviewers were raving about...but got none. Let me preface this review with the fact that I am in no way frugal about spending money. I do not cut corners and try to save a buck. I knew that this place was spendy and we were prepared. BUT... when you have the option to spend large amounts of money on something advertised as this I would expect this \"exceptional\" service and \"5 star treatment\" that was promised. We got to the hotel about 7pm with not even an offer to load our bags for us. Checked in and was given a room on the 7th floor. By the sound of the other reviewers, it seemed like the Ritz likes to accomodate celebrations with free upgrades or special perks upon arrival. Since nothing was offered, I just figured I'd ask if there were any upgrades available, and that we we're just married on saturday. (It was 7pm, how many $450.00++ /night rooms were gonna be sold after 7pm?) She told us that we could upgrade from our parking lot view to an ocean view for $100.00 more a night...or to the club level had many rooms available for an extra $250.00 a night. We said no thanks and carted our bags upstairs on our own. The room was nice and clean. Very nice room. Big plasma screen tv, computer desk and a loveseat. Large and very comfortable bed. Marble bathroom with bulvgari shampoos, soaps and shower gels. Two waffle robes in the closet. Room also had a mini bar, $3.50 for cans of pop, m&ms, $5.50 for mini liquor, $27 mini bottle of chardonnay ect. In room safe, coffee maker, ect. Was impressed by the room and the housekeeping staff. Only thing I was not happy with housekeeping about was that they came at 7am and knocked twice and on the 3rd they just used their key to come in. I am sleeping in on my vacation, so when it says 'privacy please' on my door I do not appreciate you barging in. Especially when the past few days we had gone over this already! However, they did a very nice job and always came back and cleaned while we were gone. Skip the room service if you can. We used it twice and I dont think it was anything special. (Stay away from the seafood linguini alfredo. Trust me!) There were 2 steakhouses, II Mulino and BLT. Didn't eat there, but they looked and smelled nice. I read other reviews on the exceptional guest service and how the staff was all 'my pleasures' and knew your names. The only people who remembered our names and used them while we were there were the parking attendants. Did not see any of these personal notes and little gifts that are talked about. I was lucky if they remembered to leave bottled water. Also, there are some extra fees... the hotel charges you a 10% a day resort fee. Then you also have to pay either $17 (self) or $25-$28 (valet) a day for parking. When you order room service there is a $2.50/person fee plus the 17% gratuity added on. Like mentioned in the other reviews, there is noticeable plane noise. It was not constant, and not extremely disturbing, but you can hear it and it could be distracting, I guess, but it did not bother us. The pool was beauiful and so was the beach. No problem finding chairs anywhere. There were no kids overtaking the pool durning my stay... but I did see the $18 kid's pail and shovel that another reviewer was talking about. (LoL) I didnt hear or see planes taking off while lounging on the beach. The casino was exceptionally clean and accomodating. There was no smoke (I think there is no smoking in PR anymore) and the servers were quick to refill you if you tipped enough the first time. At night it got a little busy and sometimes the locals weren't too happy to share a table with you. Most of the dealers didnt bother to speak with you or really interact with you unless you spoke spanish. I can honestly say that these employees were really interested in doing anything other than dealing cards. They spent alot of time looking around and talking to each other from table to table durning the game. My best advice to you is to buy the insurance on the rental car if you get one. There is apparently no rules or regulations on the roads. (I only got stopped because I was driving unbeknownst in the bus lane LoL) but the officer barely spoke english so he just told me to do a U-turn in the middle of the road (which is common) and continue on my way. AND... beware if you drive into old san juan. Very tight squeezes and alot of odd one ways... All and all if I was ever to return to PR, I would stay here...only beacause everywhere else looked like the ghetto.

If you want something beach side then this is the place. You can hang out by their large pool and then walk a few steps to access the beach. It's easy to hang by the pool for a couple of hours and then walk to the beach for a while then go back to pool. My husband and I managed to do this for a couple of days. It does not get old. We were there for \"R&R\" and thats what we got ! This hotel is not near Old San Juan. You can catch a cab to Old SJ for $20 each way. Hotel Food - the food was good but --be ready for the price. It is expensive. First we ate at an outdoor cafe/bar. It's near the pool and beach. Our lunch consisted of 2 sodas, a chicken wrap and a hamburger with fries. This totaled about $40 not including tip. We had to remind ourselves this is the Ritz. It was good food though. We also tried room service. This was great. I ordered a pizza for myself (It is enough for 2 people) and it tasted great. Casino- This was always crowded. It had tons of games to play. cha-ching! Spa - We had to try this. My husband and I both had a swedish massage at the spa. This was great. We didn't know it at the time but you can request a couple's massage. Cost $150 PP + tip.

This is my first review I am ever writing, that's how good it was to stay there. On our arrival at 10:30 in the morning they had our room ready for us which was amazing in itself! We could then freshen up before heading out again. When we walked down our hall they were painting it and there wa an oder of paint in the hall (note that later in the afternoon prior to regular check in time they were done painting and the smell was gone). We thought we would see if we could get another room away from the painting although there was NO paint smell in our room. They hotel immediately found us another and two people escorted us there to see it first. We decided to keep our original and told them we thought it would be fine later and we were right. It totally was fine a couple hours later. We left the room at that time to go down to the beach and pool. It was a little rainy that day so we had some lunch at the bar at the pool. While there I asked a server where the closest restroom was. She pointed in the direction but said, \"may I escort you there?\" . I was a little taken aback by a waitress stopping what she was doing to WALK ME TO THE RESTROOM but I thought it was also extremely polite. Later that day we returned to our room to see that the manager of housekeeping had left us a Oil Fragrance Diffuser in our room as a present because of our concern for the smell. We actually did not have an odor in our room but for the our entire stay when we walked into our room it was fantastic to have that new smell waiting for us and was a reminder of the thoughtful gift (see photo) On the beach they not only give you towels ( regular thing) but set up your chair exactly as you want it. We watched as they \"made our chair\" and dug holes in the sand to put umbrellas. We were holding coffees so he ran off and got us a table to set them on. One morning we asked a hostess where we could get a cup of coffee and instead of sending us away she went and got it herself, free of charge. While at the pool we were offered iced towels and Evian mist to cool us off. Every thing at the Ritz was \"my pleasure\". So much so it became a huge joke between my friend and I. Our rooms were extremely clean and orchids and chocolates were left for us at night. Also- about breakfast in the hotel- HERE IS A HINT: If you go to the main bar which is a coffee bar in the morning (great iced mochaccino's) you can also order individual breakfast item's for $3.50. On the day we were going to the rain forest we could just grab a bagel and coffee in a to-go container. They packaged it beautifully for us to take. If you get the continental buffet it is $17.50. My guess is that not many realize you can purchase individual items if you just ask. I mean how much can a person really eat for breakfast! The location was ok but we had absolutely no problem taking a taxi to Old San juan. This did seem like more of a family/married couples hotel but also as two single 30 year old women there is the El San juan Hotel two doors down that has fantastic night life! Some of this stuff may just be what a hotel should do any way but it was a constant pleasure to be here. And in today's world the service we received is NOT the norm.

Let me tell you that we were upset at first but then one of the managers, Carlos came over to us and was genuinely concerned and only wanted to make us happy. Eventually the problem was rectified and I have to say that he handled it incredibly professionally and made us feel like he actually cared. Next, we stayed on the club level. I don't think I can even begin to describe how incredible the cub level was. The staff on the club level just couldnt do enough to make us happy. Everything was \"my pleasure\" and the funny thing was I really felt like they meant it. Rita, Venus, Rey, Robert and Brandon, the manager would have gone to any length to please us and all the other guests on the club level. I seriously felt like royalty as did the other people who we met who were also staying on the club level. They were just unbelievably incredible and I must say it made the vacation even more enjoyable. When I booked this I noticed many people commenting or asking about the club level and for those who are curious I will elaborate a little bit on the club level. They had 4 food presentations per day. Breakfast, lunch, hors d'oueveres and deserts and after dinner drinks. The food was so delicious and presented so beautifully, the staff was so nice and the room was so nice with the outdoor balcony overlooking the pool and the beach that you could stay there for every meal if you wanted to. We had made dinner reservations before we left New York and everything changed when we got there. I can't even tell you how helpful the club lounge staff was. Every time I changed my mind they changed the reservation. It was unbelievable. And, every single request I made (and I made many) their response was always \"My Pleasure\". I can't even begin to say how wonderful they were. The beach was absolutely beautiful. Never ever had an issue with getting a chair (or four) wherever we wanted them on the beach. The pool was a little bit harder but just harder to get a chair where you wanted it if you didnt come early in the morning but I NEVER had a problem getting chairs at the pool in fact one day I really wanted to be in the first row around the pool and the pool person actually moved chirs closer to eachother to make room for 3 chairs for me in the first row around the pool. Also, we never, ever had a problem getting anything at the pool or on the beach. There were always waiters and waitresses coming over to us. that was never an isue. Also, by the pool for the kids they made snow cones for no charge and always had cold bottles of water at the pool and at the beach and they weere free. Also, they would come around the beach and the pool and give you cold washcloths which I thought was very nice. The rooms were beautiful. The resort was beautiful immaculately maintained. The water sports on the beach were great, totally accessible and most of them were free. I could go on and on. It was a fabulous vacation, a fabulous, beautiful resort and the staff really set the Ritz Carlton apart from other resorts.

We dined outside and there was a giant iguana walking around\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had relatives that had them as pets but I have never seen them out in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wild.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Service was slow and of course it was pricey. We did breakfast in our room both mornings and wasn't impressed. The food was blah, and our potatoes terrible. We dined the first night at Marmalade. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. It was amazing! My husband said it was easily the best meal he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever had, and since he works at a restaurant he knows what he's talking about. We had the 10 course tasting menu for $100 a person. This included the wine pairings, so we thought this was a great deal. The wines the courses weren't cheap wines so it was a bargain considering the amount you'd be eating and drinking. They had the most amazing pasta with truffles I have ever had. I wish we had more time we would have gone back there for another meal. The following day we spent at the beach. The pool was very crowded and we didn't want to wasted time trying to find good chairs so we went to the beach... no shortage of chairs there. We did take a dip in the pool later, but the pool itself is pretty chilly, considering how warm it was outside. I went jetskiing for the first time ever, believe it or not. It was interesting to say the least. You can sign up at a shack right on the beach at the Ritz, but they pick you up on a jet ski and take you over to where the esj towers are. It was something like $60 for a half hour. We went to Metropol that night for a quick meal before our scheduled biobay tour. I guess any restaurant would have had a hard time living up to our experience at Marmalade the night before\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but even if I had dined someplace else the night prior, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I would go back to Metropol. There is this amazing Cuban restaurant in our hometown so I thought the food would be as good as that. Not the case. I was very disappointed in my shrimp cocktail (I wanted something light as an appetizer). The shrimp was rubbery and the cocktail sauce came out of a heinz bottle. When I make my own shrimp at home I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use bottled sauce so I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to have that while dining out. My husband enjoyed his cerviche very much though. For a main course I ordered the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cuban style\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd peppersteak. It was basically just peppersteak you could eat anywhere with rice, beans and plantains. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember what he had but he enjoyed it. We then went on our biobay tour. We had booked our trip well in advance with Castillo tours, the company that has a desk located right at the Ritz. We received a phone call at 4:00 PM as we were getting ready for dinner that our tour was cancelled as the other two couples booked cancelled and they needed a minimum of 6 to go. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if this really happened as earlier when I was confirming our tour I had heard that one of their desk agents accidentally told people the tour was at 4:45 instead of 6:45 and then they tried to get me to switch to the newly created timeslot. So when they called at 4 saying that the tour was cancelled, my options were to go at 4:45 (45 minutes from that moment) or go tomorrow. We had planned our trip in advance and had plans the following night so that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. I suspected that they really got those other people to switch to the earlier time to please the large group in house that had accidentally been told the wrong time, so I was not happy. Luckily, they called another company who was able to accommodate us that evening, so we did the tour through E & B tours. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I would recommend dealing with Castillo Tours as any time I was near the concierge and observed their desk, they seems to be overwhelmed and disorganized. So the biobay tour itself was an interesting experience. It was a long drive to Los Croabas, where the actual trip itself started. After a quick kyack 101 lesson, we were off. Since the point is to see the dynoflates, you kyack 25 minutes through an extremely narrow canal\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 IN THE DARK. The only light you see is the glow stick circle of the kyack in font of you. The bay itself is quite amazing to see. My husband took advantage when they said it was ok to take a swim, but I had read that it only caused harm to the ecological setting of the bay so I decided against it and waiting in the kyack for his return. We were so exhausted we could not wait to get home. We finally mad it back to the hotel and were ready for bed. That evening my husband was well enough to grab a quick dinner so we were able to make our dinner reservations at Baru. This restaurant is considered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153creative Caribbean\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and is very good. Definitely better than Metropol, but not as good as Marmalade. Service was great and like Marmalade, this can be found in Old San Juan. The Casino is extremely smoky. I live in NY, a state that has abolished smoking in public places, so I'm not used to being around that much smoke anymore.... it got to me pretty quickly so I left while my husband played. Service at the Ritz is great of course, just not as good as a Four Seasons property. And seriously, I absolutely hate resorts that charge a \"resort fee\" and if my husband wasn't so insistent on staying at the Ritz I would have looked elsewhere just because of this. I absolutely agree that she should take a cue from the Four Seasons and not charge this. Why should I pay for all the services that I may not want to use. I didn't do any of the \"water sports\" and the one I did, the jetskiing, wasn't included. On the beach, not once did someone offer to get me a drink, even though everyone around me was getting served. It took me a while to flag someone down when I wanted to have lunch sent over. You can order off a very minimal menu and they will bring you lunch on the beach. Food overall of course is overpriced. Overall for the price you pay and what you get, I will stick to visiting places that have Four Seasons properties. I just felt like we got more for our money there. However, it was still a lovely stay and we did enjoy ourselves.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!

The highlights: Beach: well attended, and plenty of chairs, umbrellas, etc. They also have a few hammocks about which I fell in love with. Nothing beats sitting in one, listening to the ocean with the tropical breeze blowing over you. LOVE IT! Pool - open 24hrs! The water can get a bit cool at night, but there's always the Jacuzzi to warm you up. Also, you can get a drink at the bar at Mares and they'll let you take it to the pool (in a plastic cup, of course). Food: Speaking of Mares, they have a great seafood buffet on Friday's. Well worth the price. Besides that, we didnt really do a whole lot of eating on the property. We opted for trying local tastes of the island. If you want great local food, hope across the street to Metropol. VERY good. Rooms: all you would expect the Ritz to be. I feel obligated to make a comment about the noise, since so many reviwers mention it. We had a room facing out to the airport, and I gotta tell you the noise was not an issue. The only time you really noticed was maybe once an hour or so when a big 747 would take off. Honestly, I noticed the noise from the A/C more than the planes! Funny, the place I actually noticed it was on the beach...it's *really* loud there. Service: The housecleaning staff were very attentive. They leave you a couple bottles of water in the room each day, but I get so thirsty in the humidity so each day I would write a note for the maid to leave a couple extra, and she would leave like five more. Every morning when we left our room, if she was in the hall she would greet us by name. Room Service was also wonderful. What can I say...this property lived up to the Ritz reputation.

Rooms: The rooms were very nice. Housekeeping did an excellent job. We had a pool view which in reality could have been a partial ocean view. No complaints, other than that none of the windows open. (Digressing for a moment, this seemed to be a common theme in Puerto Rico. Beautiful weather, beautiful scenery, but most of the restaurants, etc were all indoors, with the A/C cranked up to the mid 60's.) Gym: The gym was nice for a hotel gym. Great treadmills and other cardio equipment with individual TV's. Spa Facilities: I didn't get a spa treatment, but did use the locker room. The steam room was nice, the sauna was very spacious (but co-ed, which I thought was odd to be sweating buckets in front of the opposite sex). Food: The breakfast buffet was so-so. They could have used more varieties of fresh fruit and another guy working the omelet station. Service was spotty and was downright horrible one of the mornings. The lobby bar was good because they had live entertainment at night which was nice to come home to. There was a seafood buffet on Friday night that wasn't very good. They had raw oysters, a rarity for a buffet, and I quickly figured out why after I spit the first one I tasted out. I hope that they had been frozen first, and they were horrible. There was an Il Mulino in the casino and a BLT Steak. I highly suggest that you avoid them both and come to NYC if you would like to try either. San Juan isn't Las Vegas, and the restaurants were very overpriced and were hollow shells of what they should have been. It's sad that Tourondel has attached his name to BLT Steak in PR and I plan on writing a letter to let him know how bad it was. It was foreshadowing when I sat at the bar for a cocktail and asked what kind of bourbon they had and was told \"Jack Daniels or Canadian Club\" (neither a bourbon) and then was mocked when I asked that a glass of red wine be poured in a wine glass meant for red wine (they had given me a narrow white glass). They apparently thought I wanted a bigger pour (it was a bigger glass). Someone at a dive bar should expect better, much less a Ritz where their motto should be to serve it to me in my shoe if I request. Pool area: Crowded, but you could always find chairs. The pool service was horrible. Final thoughts: I'll try not to rant, but I really wish resorts like the Ritz Carlton would take a cue from the Four Seasons and STOP CHARGING RESORT FEES. Please, just increase the price of the room. It's not fair to business travelers, who may not use the pool, and not fair to people who expect some decent service out of their 10% ($60+). The pool staff could not be bothered to set up a chair, no one came around to give water much less drinks, etc, etc. Please, just charge it as part of the cost of the room, and then make your workers actually work for the possibility that they might get tips for doing what should be their jobs. Everyone just feels ripped off, and no one wins. The service at the Ritz could have been much better. It wasn't bad, except at the restaurants, but it wasn't 4/5 star either. They need to get better food and/or get the backers of their 'name' restaurants to give their brands a little bit of attention. In the end, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a Ritz Carlton and a good hotel.

We stayed from May 5 to May 12th. We This was our second time to Puerto Rico, the 1st time we stayed at the \"Westin Rio Mar\". When we arrived at the airport, we took a taxi to The Ritz. The hotel is about a 5 minute drive from the airport. Upon pulling up, someone greated us with a \"welcome\" and picked up our luggage. We then went straight to the front desk to check-in. I was not impressed with check in, we were told our room would not be ready for another few hours. We had no choice but to wait which, was fine. After all, this was my vacation and I wouldn't let one minor thing upset me. After waiting about 1 hour, we had a room, no big deal. Now, one to the whole review. This will be broken down into sections: ROOM :Our room was a Pool View, located on the fifth floor. The room rate was roughly $285 a night through our local travel agent. After a few days, we quickly learned that just about everyone else staying were paying $400 and above. The room was excellent. A good view of the pool, and grounds of the resort. The bed was nice, the bathroom was very clean. Our room had a Plasma tv and free internet. I can't think of one bad thing about to say about the room. FOOD: The food was great. We had at least one meal at the resort every day. However, the food was expensive. A hamburger was $15. Now, don't get me wrong, it was the best $15 burger I've ever had. Not to mention, you are staying at a Ritz. So, the prices weren't going to upset me. The Prime 787 was OUTSTANDING! I can not say enough about the level of service I received from our server. Our first time eating there, we received a card from our server when we got back to the room thannking us for celebrating our anniversary with them. Needless to say, I called the server back when we arrived to our room requesting him again for the following night. We also ate at The Palm next door (El San Juan). We had a good dinner there and for some reason, were given a $60 credit to our bill. The manager asked my wife and I if this was the first time eating at The Palm. After we told him \"Yes\", he gave us a $60 credit saying, order anything you woud like. The pool bar had typical bar food (burgers, pizza, salads). The service at the pool bar was good. Everyone was very friendly and the Madelia (local beer) was a lot of fun every weekday. About a block down from The Ritz (if you walk out of the lobby and turn right, walk down one or two blocks and this place will be on your right hand side). there is a little cafe, ice cream shop. We ate breakfast there as well. It's nothing special but good breakfast food for an inexpensive cost. SERVICE: \"Our Pleasure\" was the theme for our stay. No matter what I asked, that was what I heard in return. The customer service was the highest I've ever received. Now, this was the first time that I have stayed at a Ritz but, I have stayed in hotel rooms which cost $3,000 a night. I didn't receive that level of service at any time at those hotels. BEACH: The beach at The Ritz is amazing. It is probably one of the nicest beached in Puerto Rico. The water isn't crystal clear blue but, it is nice. The sand is nice as well. They have hammicks, beach chairs, and such. Bar and food service are provided at the beach. Other reviews have mentioned that the service is somewhat slow. I didn't time how long it would take for me to get a drink at the beach. I didn't feel the service was slow. SAFETY: I've read reviews where people said SAN JUAN is not safe. At no point did I feel unsafe. We walked around the surrounding area, talked to locals, walked around Old San Juan. It's all what you make of it. Life in San Juan is the same as anywhere else. They have good parts, and bad parts. Don't go to the bad parts. POOL: The pool was a lot of fun. They had raffs and tubes to lay on and relax. Not to mention the service of the cool wash cloth to cool down! SHOPPING: A few shops are located inside the hotel. For the ladys, yes, they do have a Tiffany's inside the hotel. The other store was ok but, I don't remember the name of it. My personal opinion is the shops at the El San Juan are a little nicer. Airplane Noise: Yes, if you are laying on the beach, you will see airplanes taking off. Yes, you can hear it. Now, I think EVERYONE complaining about that is nuts. At no time did it bother me or upset me. Look, if you want to be in the middle of nowhere, then go to the middle of nowhere. It is fine, the noise is barley hearable. All in all, this was an excellent hotel. The customer service was top notch at all times. Like the name of this review, everything was \"My pleasure\". I had made some high demands (rose peddles in the room for my wife) and it was taken care of. Nothing was to big for them. All of the staff at the bar was friendly.

We ended up booking Friday night and Saturday night at the Ritz Carlton. First the good: The grounds are beautiful and the staff is great. Everyone greeted us, and were very friendly to my infant son. The food was exceptional and the service, as usual for the Ritz, was great. Also, I believe the beach was private which is unusual for Puerto Rico. Most hotel chains share the beach with the general public. Our room was a standard entry level room with partial view of the ocean. The room was somewhat small as we couldn't fit the crib in there comfortably so our son slept in our bed for the two nights. The bed was a California King and had plenty of room so it wasn't a big deal. Overall, I feel that it was above average. Now for the bad (which really isn't too bad), I didn't feel like the Ritz catered to families. There was no kiddie pool and the one and only pool was 3 feet deep all around. Unless you have an inflatable toy for your kids, you will be holding them the entire time. I also don't think the pool was heated. I know it's 90 degrees, but it felt cold when you first got in. My son did not enjoy it at all and we had to spend the morning by the pool while my husband visited with family. We paid almost $600 per night, at that price, I would have liked to have a heated pool. There were no playgrounds for the kids to play or an area where you can let them go wild. There was one saving grace and that is at Mares - their casual restaurant. It turns out they lend hotel guest a DVD player with Disney movies so the kids can be entertained while the adults eat. It was the first time I can remember having a hot meal in ages. Overall it was a good stay.

Upon check-in we were offered a choice of the standard room we had originally booked - with two doubles and a view, or a club-level room with no view (well of the very nearby airport and mountains) and a king-size bed - at the same rate. We chose the club-level room and we were glad we did! The \"club\" was just down the hall from our room and seemed to always be open for a different meal or cocktail or snack. Each day there were four services: a continental breakfast, lunch, cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, and desserts and cordials. The meals were buffet style and were light, healthy and delicious. It doesn't get much better than your boyfriend handing you a glass of champagne during your shower because there were two chilled uncorked bottles at all times in the club room down the hall. The club staff members were very friendly and helpful. The club room had a beautiful view of the pool and ocean and there is a balcony with seating if you want to have your meal outside (this more than made up for the airport view). There are also books, iPods, and a computer for your use. Considering the price of the meals in the hotel - according to other reviewers -(we wouldn't know because we never had to pay for any of them) and the price of drinks - Club Level is the way to go if it's an option for you. We checked-in late - around midnight - so maybe that had something to do with our luck. Our room was beautiful and roomy and room service was impeccable. A fresh orchid along with chocolates and fresh bottles of water were bedside each day. Plenty of fresh new towels in the bathroom - along with robes and slippers. Other reviewers complained about the water pressure but I thought it was fine. If you want lots of water pressure go stand under one of the lion spouts in the pool! The hotel is lively - yet quiet and elegant at the same time. One night there was a live bongo performance in the lobby that was fun to see - but for the most part it was quiet. We were fortunate to have beautiful weather each day - around 85 and sunny and breezy. The ocean water was very warm and the sand was soft and clean. We never had to wait for chairs or towels at the beach - although chairs by the pool were a little difficult to negotiate. If you know how to sail, then definitely take adavantage of the catamarans available - and included in the resort fee. Fortunately my bf is an expert sailor and handled our boat effortlessly - however we saw a couple of peeps have difficulty turning their boat around and coming dangerously close to drifting upon the sharp coral that is just below the water surface in some areas. Ouch! As far as other activities at the hotel - the spinning classes run by Francisco were challenging (I'm told) - although I would pass on the beginning yoga class (Jackie) - unless you have never taken a yoga class before. It was basically 45 minutes divided into 10 minutes of light stretching, 20 minutes of ab work, then 15 minutes of lying on your mat (I guess that was supposed to be shivasina). I heard Francisco has a fantastic hatha class, but I opted to sleep-in instead. I highly recommend Evelyn if you are going to have a massage treatment at the spa. I chose the 50 minute deep tissue and she was excellent. It was a perfect massage experience. The padding on the table is heated and feels amazing. They also use heated and scented towels and pillows on your eyes, legs, and under knees - usually considered \"signature\" treatment at other spas. The casino is super-fun, although a little more low-key than the one at the Hotel El San Juan which was absolutely packed. At least at the Ritz you never had to wait for a spot at the table and you didn't feel like a loser for making $2 bets on roulette! The other casino was a little more intimidating in my opinion. At the Ritz If you get a players card, then make sure the dealers know you have it and give you credit accurately for your time and average bets.The dealers were very friendly - although it took a little while to get a cocktail. The pool area at night is beautiful. The lights, palm trees, pool, fountains, flowers and warm breezes are amazing. You can hear the coqui \"frogs\" - although I'm told they are not really frogs - throughout the grounds. They sound like chirping birds. I was also told their little chirp means \"I love you,\" but maybe they just say that to woo tourists. Old San Juan is beautiful both day and night. During the day check out the grounds of the Fort El Morro and Fort San Cristobal. In town there are many shops, restaurants, and art galleries. Also - outlet shopping including Coach, Polo, Dooney and Burke - and a few others I can't remember. For our one night in Old San Juan we had dinner at Barrachina. It seemed a little touristy but we decided to stay for dinner for the hour-long flamenco show. The food was ok, but the show was fabulous. Not only was there a spanish guitarist, but also a singer - in addition to the three flamenco dancers. Service was a little on the slow side but the drinks were stiff. If you go there make sure you keep your receipt. We were half-way across Old San Juan after dinner in an alley on our way to the New Yorican, when one of the waiters from Barrachina tracked us down saying we didn't pay! After producing our receipt the thankful waiter returned to the restaurant - but it could have been a not so pleasant situation. After dinner we went to Marmalade for a digestif. Marmalade is a jolt of contemporary and chic compared with the more romantic Spanish atmosphere of Barrachina that included candles, wrought iron and other Spanish decor. If you are in Old San Juan and need taxi service back to the Ritz, then call Ana Figueroa with Island Taxi Service (787-450-3242). She is a taxi driver/ tour guide and is super -fun and hilarious (and informative). We laughed with her the entire cab ride back to the hotel. We spent one night hanging out at the Hotel El San Juan. I mentioned their casino above...They also have a few restaurants - including The Palm - where we had dinner - and a nightclub and an additional live music lounge with dancing if you are in the mood. I had probably the best mojito I have ever tasted at the bar along the wall next to the tobacco shop. It was a fabulous trip. The Ritz was amazing. I would go back in a heartbeat! One last tip though would be to carry-on your luggage if possible. The SJ airport was nuts on the way out and United still doesn't know where my suitcase is.

Unfortunatley, rain for three days and cloudy weather on the fourth \"dampened\" our experience, but the one and a half glorious sunny days, of our five, were spectacular. Quite simply, the Ritz in San Juan is an \"elegant\" hotel with all the good things that implies! The grounds are spectacular -- like visiting a botanical garden. The pool is elegant, the beach is superbly maintained and spotless. There's a sense of graciousness and quiet throughout the hotel. The lobbies are superbly maintained, and all the staff is quick with a \"good morning!\" which quickly extends to the guests making things so very pleasant here! At the pool and beach areas there are more than a sufficient number of people to help you with chairs, towels, drinks, and so on. Each is friendly and eager to help. But this IS an expensive hotel! Our ocean view, balcony room was large and most comfortable. The bathroom almost larger than some hotel rooms I've stayed in. Beds are comfy and cozy, and there's a huge flat screen TV. All this was for a room rate over $750 per nite, with a 10% charge added on for \"accessories\" like beach towels, use of the gym, etc. It's pretty much impossible to eat for less than $25 per person for breakfast, and a simple lunch is in the $35 per person range. Dinner is even more. All this is without liquor. BUT: the food is superb, the service excellent and the prices are what you would pay in any similar restaurant outside the hotel. Some other small annoyances: Room service was slow, and breakfast took over an hour, althought they promised 20 minutes. The food arrived cold. We were scheduled to go off for a day of touring, so this was quite inconveninet. In response to our dissatisfaction, though, the $55 breakfast for two charge was \"removed\" from our account. While the \"people\" in the hotel are incredibly friendly and helpful, many of the \"systems\" in the hotel, such as the one designed for check in, failed them. We waited all afternoon to get our room, which was a disappointment as we had paid extra on our air fare to get to Puerto Rico early. A promised upgrade, for which we were paying an additional $150/nite (club level), never materialized. A few mechanical problems also cropped up, such as the door handles falling off the balcony door, and the airconditioning thermostat failing on the first day. BUT: Puerto Rico is WONDERFUL!

The pool was beautiful but we opted for the beach since there was more of a breeze from the ocean. There were a large amount of children there but I think most of them were in a day camp and even the ones that werent..were no bother. If you like to workout..they offer some good classes which are all included in your resort fee. I ran on the beach one morning which was kinda hard since the sand was so soft but nice nonetheless.

Its located at a hotel in Ocean Park (about 5 min away) called Numero Uno. It is just like Pamelas but less known and you can eat directly on the beach. Food was great and it was very romantic. All in all the Ritz was great and coming from NY..it was the perfect getaway weekend trip.

We took the advice of others here and booked a room on the club level, which was worth the extra $$$. We had a partial view of the ocean, and despite our room facing towards the airport, it was very quiet. (The complaints about the airport, being someone from NYC - are not warranted. You hear a plane every so often but it doesn't take away from the experience). The great - room is beautiful, huge bathroom, housekeeping did a nice job. Gym was nice amenity to have. Pool is gorgeous and grounds are well-kept. Il Mulino and BLT Steak (both on the property) were wonderful dining experiences, and we have both of those restaurants in NYC. They were better in San Juan! Casino was a delight to have nearby, and the dealers were all nice, friendly, and clientele was nice as well. Very easy to get to the hotel from the airport. The club level lounge was perfect. Had breakfast and lunch there every day, and appetizers as well. Breakfast at the regular hotel restaurant is $50 per person for their buffet, so that difference alone is worth the club level! The needs improvement : 1) the spa. Their upstairs quiet waiting area is directly over the lobby where you enter for the gym as well, and it's noisy. The sauna and jacuzzi are co-ed, something I am not comfortable with nor did I expect for a hotel that's a minimum of around $400 a night. I had a swedish massage and it was as if the therapist was giving me tickles and not massages. I asked for a little more pressure but it wasn't great. 2) The pool staff. Before 11:30AM, not a single person came around to take drink/food orders (we wanted fruit and/or bottled water). You had to go to the little tiki bar behind the pool to help yourself. I went around 11AM and waited a full 15 minutes at the bar for someone to help me b/c he made himself look too busy with others and by going in the back. As a side note to the pool staff - there were many of them standing around where you pick up towels, not helping anyone. When you DID get someone to help, you had to flag them down and yell to be sure they wouldn't just rush past you. I've been at other Ritz and other 4-5 star hotels, and they stop in every so often to check on you. Here they did not. Since you are paying a 10% resort fee (around $40-$70 a day) I'd expect more. 3) Mares - Ritz's restaurant with a Friday night seafood buffet. Who serves stone crab claws with NO small seafood forks? Not a single one on the property. Seafood was not well prepared (a buffet with a station to get pasta/seafood to order) and it was an apprentice chef cooking our food. He cranked out 1 dish in the time the chef next to him did 4. ALSO - at Mares, our waiter literally disappeared (we watched him leave the restaurant) after we ate dessert, and waited 20 minutes before getting up and asking another server for our bill. Lastly, that same night -- a hostess from the restaurant staff tracked us down (wrongly) because she said we signed the wrong restaurant bill. it turns out they gave our wrong bill to someone else.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel...

This time we went with our now 2 1/2 year old and our 8 month old. Here is a breakdown (I like to write, sorry): Room - We stayed in a Standard room which we were a bit worried about, but got an excellent corporate rate (I would ask for one when you book) for the room. The room was very nice with plenty of towels, flat screen tv, plenty of towels and drawer space. It was a bit smaller than I am used to but that becuase e got 2 double beds, one for us and one for our daughter plus a crib. We found out later that a King room has a pull out twin sofa and more room. They supplied us with a nice Crib at no charge. This really impressed me, the maid came in a knew we had a toddler, next thing I know we had bed gaurds set up. They store your empty luggage too. Pool - Nice pool and only 3 ft deep. I guess this is the only non kid friendly part since there is not shallow 1 ft area for kids, but it was fine since we broght a floatee. Staff always there to set up chairs. Get this, they have pack-n-plays that they will set up for you. Tons of rafts to lie on in the pool. Only other drawback, its a bit chilly when you get in but gets to be refreshing afterwards. Ocean - Probably the best part of the hotel. Clean, great sand, very warm. I didnt expect such a nice beach on the atlantic but it was great. I dont care what anyone says, Ritz has the best beach location in Isla Verde. Plus once again staff there to set up chairs with umbrellas, set you up with pack-n-plays, buckets and shovels, fruit. Plenty of boogie boards, sail boats too. Food - Food was eh. Breakfast buffet got a bit boring after a while, expecially for $25 a pop. Coffee was very weak (I like my Coffee) We ate a few nights at Masa which was also overpriced for the quality. Sushi was good though. Didnt try to gourmet places so cant comment. Casino - Was nice. Fri and Sat nights they have poker which was a good way to spend time. Get a comp. card if you go, I got $50 added to my bill when I left and trust me, i didnt spend that much money or time there. Staff/Service - Excellent! Everything was \"My pleasure\". Had an issue with a food delivery, got $100 knocked off my bill. Went to breakfast and dinner with my daughter, had portable DVD players brought to us each time with Dora the Explorer, toy balloons..one night they brought her ice cream on the house. I asked for a to go box for breakfast and some water to go, I got a big bottle of Figi water and 2 containers to fill up for the day (one way to save money). They definetly made you and your children feel welcome and pampered. I expecially likle to nightly turn down service with chocolates and more free water. Resort - The nice part of it is that everything is right next to each other, within 2 minute walk you can get from your room to the pool then to the beach. Everything was very clean (I saw them cleaning at 4AM when my daughter woke and I had to roll her back to sleep). Hallways and lobby were always clean. BTW, all of the above amenities were free of charge although you pay a 10% resort fee for it but its nice not to have think about that :) Overall great experience, keep up the good work Ritz!

The workers for the pool and beach area were always very helpful with the exception of the waiter staff for serving up drinks. They were in short supply and we frequently went to the outdoor bar ourselves for our drinks. The spa and fitness center were very nice with full days of scheduled workout classes by the hour starting at 7:00am.

We heard only muffled sounds from the airport in our room. However, we heard our neighbors kids and conversations quite clearly in the connecting room. The hotel was very accomodating and moved us right away into a new room. At the Ritz, we dined at Il Mulino which we would highly recommend. The food was good and the service was exceptional. We also dined at Mares which was ok but expensive. The service was not very good. We also dined at the 3rd restaurant, a NY Steakhouse, BLT.The food was good, the price was high, and the setting was not nearly as intimate as Il Mulino.

The staff really goes out of its way to be friendly and accomodating. We had a few lunches at the beach/pool restaurant and ate dinner at the Mare, the Ritz Carlton's seafood restaurant and these were very good experiences. (There is a good casual restaurant across the street called Metropol, as well as one a few blocks down in a strip shopping center.) At the Ritz-Carlton, there are plenty of available beach chairs, both poolside and on the beach. We booked an off-site catamaran trip through the hotel, which sailed (with about 35 other people) to a small island to snorkel. That trip was well worth the $83 price (about 6 hours on the boat) and included unlimited food and drinks (with rum, if desired). The R-C offers a full day of varied exercise classes, if that's your thing. Francisco's abs and gluts class was a really challaging workout. My only complaint was with the concierge, who only called our room at 7:10 p.m. to let us know that our requested 8:00 pm reservation at the Palm Restaurant at another hotel was unavailable. I made the request at 10:00 a.m. that morning; there was no excuse for hearing back so late of the unavailability of the requested reservation. Also, while it's true that the hotel is right across the street from the airport, I was not bothered by the airport noise, which I thought was minimal. We never ate breakfast at the hotel but walked to Denny's (out the door, to the right, about 1 block down) or to Starbucks (inside the El San Juan Hotel - out the door of the Ritz,, to the right, about three blocks down, but in the hotel.)

They have thought of everything you could possibly want and did that and more. The staff will cater to your every need and give you a smile every which way you turn. We got lost when we first arrived finding the elevator, so instead of being given directions, we were escorted to it. The staff truly sets a Ritz-Carlton apart. Rooms/Housekeeping: We had a junior suite and double room. Both were spotless and had the most comfortable bedset I have ever felt at a hotel, and I travel often. They were both ocean view, so the view out into the Atlantic was fascinating and serene. The rooms come with a huge flat screen TV and include little amenities like slippers and bathrobes. The bathroom is amazing; they are huge and again have really comfortable towels. The lotions are all European, and the showerhead is also like a massage. Housekeeping is done twice daily, and whenever you need them you can call. The turndown service is great before you come back to your room. I accidentally broke a glass one night at 1am, and I called for them to clean it up, they were in my room 10 minutes later sweeping. Pool/Beach The pool is a freeform pool with spitting lions and it is huge. They provide rafts for their guests in the pool. The only problem during the stay however was getting chairs poolside; you had to be down by 7:30am to get chairs together, which was annoying. However, the resort was full. When you do get a chair however, they are really comfy. Again little touches make the difference here, they bring around cold towels and provide iced water with oranges for your convince. The pool boys also bring around dry towels in the afternoon. The ocean was super clean and really warm water. Dining Like most nice resorts, food is really expensive here but you expect it. I ate at all three of the restaurants in the hotel, the Caribbean Grill, Il Mulino and BLT Steak. Caribbean Grill is mostly seafood, I had the ravioli and the portion was really small but really good. Il Mulino is some of the best Italian food that can be ordered and the staff there is extremely helpful and friendly. BLT Steak is opening November 28, but we were of a selected test crowd for a soft opening, the food was again out of this world, and the atmosphere is great. Casino The Caribbean is great as the gambling age is 18. Casino here is again really nice. Lots of table games, ranging from high limit to some low limit. However, be forewarned the slots pay AWFUL here (as they do in most of the Caribbean.) Free drinks, grilled cheese, chicken sandwiches and soups in the casinos for players.

Spoke with security 5 different times (head of security even came to my room) and they would assure me but house keeping would still come in. They tried to say there might be some kids playfully removing the sign but I never saw or heard any children. They never offered any gift of apology for all the times it happened. I am glad I was there each time (at least that I was aware of) and none of my jewelry came up missing.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cI wish I could be a mystery shopper\u201d", "Author": "bartleby2006", "ReviewID": "UR5985287", "Content": "Some background - My girlfriend and I booked a 3 night trip on Expedia after changing our original destination, so we were offered a special room rate that included a pool view and breakfast buffet for $313. This is the off-season. Off-season runs from September to November. It's only natural to list the complaints. At the end, I'll list the positives. 1. The initial check-in offered some confusion as the front staff did not recognize the free breakfast buffet. To correct this, it required a call to Expedia and then a return to the front staff. 2. There was some initial confusion checking in. Bell boys would just rush up to you and ask if you were checking in. There wasn't really any attentiveness; it just seemed more like aggression. For example, I stepped out for a second to answer an important cell phone call and the same bellboy that took my baggage initially rushed up to me again without any awareness that I was on the phone and asked if I needed any help. And then while I was talking on the phone off to the side, I was aggressively approached by another bell boy and again asked if I needed any help. And then when I walked back inside, I was rushed at once again by a third worker and asked if I was checking in. It was all strange behavior. There was also some confusion about my luggage. I was told that it was in storage because we had arrived early but when I went to answer my cell outside I noticed that it was left outside on the side where it could easily have been stolen. 3. There was a large stain in the carpet outside our room door. It was there when we arrived. It was never cleaned up. 4. The mattress in the room had a bed that sagged very badly, especially on the right side. You could see the bed sagging severely. This bad mattress hurt our backs (we tried switching places). 5. The casino is a bit on the cheap side. We had to wait two hours so that we could get refunded on a $27 ticket from the auto-cash machine. Apparently, they just installed new auto-cash machines that will refund your money for tickets but they were having problems with the software. One machine wouldn't take my tickets because I had folded them. The machine in question did not give me $27 -- and just flashed over and over that it was out of order and that I would have to wait for the operator. We ended up waiting 2 hours for the manager to refund us (You can't just leave the auto-cash machine, you have to stay near it.) The manager said that they had many complaints about the machine not working but they only put up an out of order sign 2 days after the incident. No compensation was given to us for having to wait, except for a sweet sandwich. The manager said that the only person allowed to offer compensation was the CFO of the hotel; so good luck to anyone that has any issues in the casino. Don't just ask for the manager, ask for the CFO! 6. This is the off-season, but there does seem to be some cheating going on by the taxi drivers who service the Ritz. For example, we were given a ticket by the taxi dispatcher at the airport that said the trip from the airport to the hotel would cost $10.50. However, when we got to the hotel, the taxi driver tried to ask for $15.00. Even after we showed the driver the ticket, she attempted to argue that we still owed her $15.00. She tried to say that she did not speak or read English. We only had 1 piece of luggage with us. I know this sounds strange but I wouldn't have mentioned it unless there were two other instances of overcharging. We had asked the concierge how much it would cost to take a taxi from the hotel to the Bicardi Rum Factory and the concierge told us $20 to 25. However, when we took the taxi, the driver asked us for $35 when arrived at the factory. And when we took the taxi back, the only available drivers asked for $40. We didn't have much of a choice, so we paid the fare. We reported all the above incidents to the Puerto Rico transportation department. I have a feeling that the overcharges were due to us staying at the Ritz so be careful. We've stayed in Puerto Rico before (4 times) but never at the Ritz and have never been overcharged on taxi rides before. 7. The Ritz-Carlton accidentally revealed the industry rate that the charge Expedia when they charged us $244 in our folio. You can check your account through the tv -- I would strongly advise anyone to do this staying at any hotel. We disputed the fees as soon as we found out, rather than waiting until we checked out. Remember, we had originally booked this vacation via Expedia, so Expedia charges us, not them. The front staff took the charge off but they also revealed what they charge Expedia ($244) and the difference that Expedia profits in the markup ($69). This didn't help us out in getting any type of discount (we were on the phone with Expedia for at least an hour) but it does reveal that there's a lot of cannabilizing of hotel rates going on -- not only for the customers who pay the full $500 rate directly throught he Ritz but even for the Expedia customers who think they are getting a good deal. One Expedia rep told us that 50% of the 500 rooms at the Ritz went through Expedia. The same rep also acknowledged that the Ritz in San Juan was under close watch by Expedia due to \"billing irregularities.\" 8. The food is average and overpriced. But that wouldn't be so bad if they offered some healthier choices -- including low-fat, low-cholesterol, or diabetic-friendly foods. Diabetes in particular is a national epidemic; especially among Latinos. So it's strange that the Ritz isn't health-conscious in this regard. Positives: 1. Rooms are nice. We got a nice room for a great rate (or a better rate than initially expected). Nice flat screen thin panel lcd televisions. A little discrepency in that there are more channels offered on the tvs in the gym than in the hotel rooms. Housekeeping is great. Nice front staff, nice casino staff, nice food staff. Everyone tries really hard. There are a lot of good bell boys to make up for the other ones that are mindless. 2. Food is overpriced but not that overpriced. You can get a Caeser salad for $11; a burger with fries for $15. We're from NYC so those prices seem within line. 3. Casino is bright and clean and slot machines seem new. 4. A lot of really great shells can be found on the beach. One of the best beaches for shell collectors anywhere in the world. 5. The entire hotel is very romantic and beautiful at night. It really shines then... the pools, the beach, etc. 6. Gym staff is alert and attentive and friendly. You can get free complimentary bottles of water, menthol-infused towels, and headphones. Gym equipment was great. And like I said earlier, you can get more tv channels in the gym than you can in your hotel room. 7. Business center with Internet connected computers is free.", "Date": "October 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cFun and Relaxing\u201d", "Author": "texashookum", "ReviewID": "UR5957931", "Content": "Well reading the reviews about the Atlantis in the bahamas made me look for a alternative vacation, so I thought why not puerto rico its non-stop from chicago no change of planes no hassles thru customs but I have never been.

It was beautiful. There is staff EVERYWHERE, willing to help and open doors, and let you off the elevator first, and get you whatever you need and call you by your name. We came over after staying at Embassy Suites, which was a great great great hotel as well. I believe that the atmosphere here is a bit stuffy, with a lot of roaming business people who tend to make the ambiance pretty tense. When walking into the $22 p/person breakfast buffet (which was pretty good), we were sort of looked down upon. The stares we got by other guests were not at all friendly. Being from New York, it was very easy for us to laugh it off though. But it was still a very uncomfortable feeling for both my boyfriend and I. Anyway, the pool is absolutely breathtaking. Those chairs will put you right to sleep. Fresh citrus water and fruits were always available to keep you cool. The Ritz's private beach is a few steps from the pool and is just as beautiful. Since its a private beach, it is one the best places to relax. Go Kayaking or sailing. It is included with your stay and since you're on vacation, make the most of it. Don't forget to relax on the hammoks too. Although food is expensive, you have to expect it when you stay here. We ate at the hotel only once for the breakfast. We also ate at Denny's 1 day which was just around the corner. Plaza las Americas was a 15min. ride and perfect if it happens to rain. Some of the staff is friendly, while some offer their services with a fake smile...we tried to joke around to relax some of them, but I guess they are just not used to it. All in all, I think I would stay here again but only for an anniversary or special occasion.

We heard the airplanes but, even though our room faced the airport, they never woke us up or bothered us.

Others we traveled with said the same thing. If you want better (but still not great) shower pressure, use the shower in the spa/fitness center. Yes, drinks and food are expensive.

The room, the pool, the dining rooms were absolutely mangificient. We were treated like royalty by each and every staff member we encountered.

We went to dinner at the hotel which was unforgettable, but we mostly stayed right in the pool area and only went to the rainforest, Casa Baccardi and Old SanJuan. That took us two days and the rest of the days we stayed right at the hotel, never wanting to leave. The hotel staff made if very comfortable and exciting to be there. The hotel itself was very condusive to relaxation. Why would you want to leave paradise to go anywhere else. The staff on the concerige floor could not be more helpful. Anything we needed or wanted was at our fingertips. They even helped us in making reservations for dinner out of the hotel and they printed our boarding passes for us. What else could anyone ask for.

I've also stayed at several other fine hotels including the Four Seasons, St. Regis, etc. If you are used to staying in these type of hotels then please read this review VERY carefully. 1) The hotel is located smack under the main airport. This means 2 things - noisy airplanes taking off over the beach while you relax and dumping jet fumes all over you it also means that \"city view\" rooms are \"runway view\". Even the double pane glass does not drown out the noise completely. 2) While the staff is incredibly friendly, they also act as if they are on vacation. Don't expect to be asked for a drink more than once per hour at the beach and dont expect any sort of real service at the lobby lounge bar. The table next to use had to go flag a waitress after waiting 20 minutes. She said she would be right there. 10 minutes later she still was not there and the couple go up and left. The best service is at the beach side grill, but don't expect too much. 3) While you expect to pay a premium for food and ammenities at the Ritz Carlton, this Ritz has taken it to another level. $18 for a \"Ritz Burger\" which tasted like a frozen beef patty. $7 for 2 pieces of sushi at the sushi bar. While the sushi was fresh they cut very small pieces that barely covered the rice...COME ON, for $3.50 per piece you could cut some fish!! 4) The concierge is not knowlegeable. We asked to book a trip to a neighboring island. It took about 45 minutes for the lady to find out that there were no travel tours because it was \"off season\". We also asked which restaurant would have a sunday brunch. The concierge pointed us to the Ritz Carribean Grill which of course did not have a brunch when we got there. 5) We returned to our room the second night and our entire floor including the room smelled like a bathroom. Very gross. Also, the room next to ours had a party going on at midnight which was very loud and the smell of marijuana poured through the door between our room and theirs. When we brought our issues to the attention of the staff they changed our room from a pool/beach view to a runway/city view. I asked if this was their normal way of doing business - to downgrade their disatissfied customers. I was simply told that they were sold out, which I did not believe judging by the number of hotel room lights that were on at night. 6) The casino is very stingy. Our friend was playing $25 chips on blackjack for almost 2 hours and she never got offered a drink once. When I tried to flag down a waitress she pretended not to see. 7) One day there was a parade outside the Ritz (a city organized event). About 2/3 of the hotel staff decided they were going to go watch.....I'm not sure who was on vacation, the guests or the staff? Conclusions - if you are used to staying at 5 star hotels then stay away from the Ritz. If you are not but want a true 5 star hotel experience then also stay away from the Ritz. All the marble and friendly staff in the world cannot make up for their disorganized and poorly run hotel My recommendations - If you want to be near the airport, we looked at the Hotel San Juan, this hotel was much nicer and much more classy. The pool was very impressive and the beach does not face the runway. If you want to stay somewhere nice for vacation in puerto rico, and don't care about the airport being near you - stick with the Westin", "Date": "September 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY, NY", "Title": "\u201cLove going there\u201d", "Author": "My_Visit", "ReviewID": "UR5783955", "Content": "We've gone twice in the past year for 3 and 4-day weekends and loved it.

It's a beautiful property in an area that could use some upgrading. We arrived for a long overdue anniversary trip and were greeted at the front desk with complimentary champagne and best wishes from the helpful staff. The room actually consisted of two rooms separated by French doors. One was a living room with a flat panel TV on the wall across from a sofa bed, a desk which became a computer desk with high speed internet and half bath. The bedroom also had a flat panel TV, dressing area, double sink, private toilet and a separate tub and oversized shower. Our next interaction with the staff was the night turn-down maid. She called me by name even though we checked in only an hour before. She got ice and took a can of pineapple juice we bought on the way from the airport to open it so we could drink our Bacardi Coco. The second night when we came back to the room, the bed was turned down and rose petals were left on the bed in the shape of a heart. What a touch! Needless to say, service was impeccable.

The staff always-attentive taking orders for restaurant. Beach is accessible from pool with chairs and umbrellas although beach water is not clear with some seaweed. Hotel is close to airport so expect noise from planes landing and taking off. The restaurants are expensive but there are fast food restaurants walking distance away.

In short, if this isn't a 5 star hotel, I don't know what is. Let me get the negatives out of the way first, so I can focus on all the positives: -Location: It's near the airport, you will hear planes while outside and probably if you have a room not facing the pool or beach -Beach: The water isn't as blue as Cancun or Aruba, but you can't blame the Ritz for that, it's combed every day, but there's some seaweed in the water -Price: Food and drink is priced at a resort rate...expensive. Breakfast buffet $17 per person, lunch by the pool consistently cost $75 for 4, a Vodka tonic $9...this added up over a 7 day stay. Now the positives: -The Staff: In short, they are the nicest bunch of people, always trying to help make your stay a nice one, always doing extra to assist you -The room: House cleaning 2x a day, thorough, willing to leave extra waters and chocolates at turndown service -The concierge: Efficient, never steered us wrong, understood how to direct a family to the best possible dining and attractions -The pool: Clean, not crowded (even on a weekend with the hotel full) All the little details were great. Complimentary fresh squeezed orange juice in the lobby, water and fruit by the pool, refrigerated washcloths in the workout facility. This is a first class hotel. I walked thru the Intercontinental Hotel and cannot believe the Ritz is not rated higher than that place. A few other notes: -I was not charged a resort fee even though AAVacations said I was subject to one...this saved me at least $200 -We ate every breakfast at a place called Piu Bello...it was a 5 minute walk from the hotel, excellent food, and very reasonably priced. They also served lunch (very good) and had GREAT Gellato. In short, I would go back to the Ritz, but probably for a long weekend or without the kids.

The hotel grounds were beautiful! I was prepared for the food to be expensive (from reading other reviews), and yes it was! Unfortunately, it was only average tasting food. The cost.......$45.00-$55.00 for lunch for 2-3 people. I went across the street to THE METROPOL restaurant (a recommendation from reading other reviews) and ate there our last night in San Juan.

That was probably the highlight of the trip (due to the weather) It was fun walking up and down the cobblestone streets, and shopping. (Girls.....if you like Coach and Dooney & Burke...there are outlet stores there, with good prices.) We also toured El Morro Fort which was nice. The view of the bay is great from there.

I had been to Puerto Rico numerous times prior and had yet to stay in San Juan. We stayed for four nights/five days and overall the stay was just OK. The lobby was nice, yet small, compared to the other hotels I've stayed at in Puerto Rico. The pool was lovely as was the beach. The proximity of the rooms to the beach was convenient. The rooms were rather boring, nothing special. First we had to switch out of our first room because it smelled terrible. We later learned you could hear nearly EVERYTHING going on in the rooms next to us. This was problematic. There wasn't even a balcony which I've had everywhere else while visiting Puerto Rico. This was disappointing given the lack of seating in the lobby. There really wasn't anywhere just to go and read a book if all of the pool and beach chairs were taken if you had an hour to kill. Given that we visited mid-January there were typical mid-day rain showers every day. It would pour for about 30-40 minutes and then the sun would return. We were irritated because maid service would be cleaning our room during this time and they were doing construction around the few chairs in the lobby so we weren't allowed to sit there. There was literally no where to go during these brief showers. Unlike other hotels who have tons of indoor space and seating just to relax and possibly go if it is raining the Ritz Carlton doesn't have a back up plan for their guests in case of rain. The food was pretty good yet overpriced as one could imagine. The night of my birthday they delivered a special birthday platter to my room containing birthday cake, chocolate covered strawberries, and sodas. Several nights we walked to neighboring hotels which seemed to be more happening at night. Granted there was live music at the Ritz casino but it didn't seem to attract the locals like the Westin did. We had so much fun watching the locals dance to the live band at the Westin.

Second, the food options at the pool/ beach could be improved/ expanded, as it's basically just sandwiches and salads. We couldn't get our perennial favorite of guacamole and chips, which I'd suggest they add, plus some other nibble-type food. Third, the pool and beach drinks and food service was average. We felt that we had to keep a sharp eye out for a waitress and sometimes it would take 20-30 minutes to get the drink you had ordered! A few more staff when it's busy would help. And servers should let you keep the tab open rather than expect you to close it, every time you order a drink.

We've stayed at other Ritz locations about four times; this was our first visit to San Juan. This particular location seems to have, what I would call, siginificant leadership problems that affect the day-to-day quality of service being provided to the clientele. This is compounded further by managment lack of involvment when issues are called to their attention. The Ritz brand has an impeccable reputation and deservedly so, but this does not apply to this location. Prior to committing to our trip at the Ritz we read the reviews and were hesitant after reading the many so-so and negative reviews. The Ritz being so expensive in itself establishes certain expectations that are hard to meet and I believed that perhaps the reviews were affected by the cost of the Ritz and not the service. Based on my stay, I feel that this RItz location cannot provide a complete level of service commensurate with the expense. Our experience was that the front desk service was marginal at best and that the concierge service was almost non-existent. There were numerous occasions when I would call the concierge to be placed on hold for ten or more minutes, promised a call back, or never had the my phone call answered, or was given wrong information. On one occasion I went down to the conceirege desk to get in line for ten minutes to be helped as my calls were not being answered. While waiting along with about 5 other clients waiting to be helped by the sole concierge, I noticed the Guest Services manager instead of helping the clients waiting in line, was off to the side just standing there shooting the breeze with one of his buddies. An absolute disgrace! This manager could have cared less and that was the sentiment that many people staying at this property observed. The front desk has similar problems. We booked our hotel directly through Ritz back in December and paid top dollar. We were shocked to meet others staying at the hotel who paid almost half of our rate by going through a discount travel agency instead of directly through Ritz. When I called this to the front desk's attention asking for them to meet that rate, they gave me some nonsense excuse that they DO in fact provide rooms at much lesser rates to discount agencies BUT would not tell me who they were or meet the same price. They agreed that there is no benefit for loyal Ritz customers to book dirreclty through RItz as opposed to going through some discount agency. Management refused to engage on this issue as well. This location needs a change in senior management as it seems that the mediocre level of performance and service of the front desk, concierge etc., come right from the top and there's nothing filtering down. Fortunately, the mid-level and junior level staff personnel are admirably attentive, professional, and helpful. The problems when things come together or are supposed to come together organizationally. Because they do not in most instances in spite of the heroics of the junior staff. Unfortunately one expects AND PAYS FOR excellent service at the Ritz. One probably will not get it at this location. In fact, I'm kind of \"Ritz'd out\", i.e. paid a bundle, had a so-so vacation, the senior staff could have cared less (or it seemed that way). If it weren't for the junior staff, I'd have rated this hotel as terrible. BTW, the housekeeping and the restaurant/dining service, staff and facilties are excellent in spite of senior staff. P.S.

I had mistakenly believed that the extremely bad reviews were simply written by high maintenance or difficult guests and that the reviews were most likely a reflection of the reviewer not the hotel. I am pretty laid back, no frills, and I tend to be very personable, and appreciative, so I thought I wouldn't have any major problems. My college roomate and I were staying at the Ritz for 3 nights to celebrate our 30th birthdays. Over the course of our short stay, we thought the service at the club level lounge was great, had no problem with the pool attendants and thought the spa was fantastic. But the service at the front tesk was so terrible that it ruined our entire stay. 1. Check - in - yikes! If the hotel is full - as it was during our entire stay -there is always a long line and the rooms are never ready on time. Not a big deal, but the problem is that they are rude to guests as they tell them their room is not available. Example - when they told me our room would be ready in an hour and I asked what time it was (as I didn't have a watch on), the person at the front desk sighed, showed me her wrist and said with a LOT of attititude - \"I don't have a watch.\" There was a clock behind her and she was at a computer which I assume had the time on it. Also, I had requested via e-mail and confirmed by phone a room with 2 double beds on the club level, and when we checked in it was obvious that they had given all those rooms away. Rather than apologizing for their inability to honor the reservation, they said they had a record of my request, but no record that that my request had ever been confirmed - ...huh? When I said that I had called a few days before to double check on my request for double beds, they insinuated that I was lying by stating that they had no record of the call ever having taken place. I can understand that things fall through the cracks when it's busy, but that's when you apologize and try to fix things, don't accuse the guest of lying! I got so personally offended and upset I asked to speak to a manager (which I never do!). The front desk manager did not apologize for the unprofessional manner of the front desk clerk - she simply said, \"Well, we have no record that you ever called so I have no choice but to give both of you the benefit of the doubt...I'm sorry but we have no proof that the call ver took place.\" Wow, so much for 5-star customer service. They ended up placing us on on a non-club floor but gave us access to the club lounge through an additional key - no big deal. However when we called to request the complimentary in-room coffee service given to club guests, they said that we did not have club privileges. I explained that we did have privileges even though we were staying on a different floor, and could he check in the computer to verify? The person said, \"No you don't have privileges\" and angrily hung up on me! Seriously, hung up! - who hangs up on people in a hotel? I mean c'mon, it's not that hard to call back - they are the front desk! I later learned that the system was down, and therefore the person I spoke with was unable to look us up on the computer and because I was calling from a non-club floor, he assumed I was not a club guest. But then why didn't he explain that the system was down, and they were unable to confirm my status? Note: when I called later and learned what had happened - no apology - they never apologize, sometimes explain why they are rude - but rarely an apology. There were many other outrageous experiences/run ins with the front desk - but I think these give a pretty good picture. One final example was our wake up call the day we left. I called the night before and asked for a 8AM wake up call with coffee. They called (and delivered the coffee) at 6AM. Since I'm not a morning person I didn't realize that they called 2 hours early until I had my coffee, took a shower and then looked at the clock. So I decided to go back to sleep and called back down to make sure that they would still call us at 8. The person who answered said rudely \"Yes, we already have it in our computer, an 8AM wake up call.\" I said back pretty sharply at this point, \"Why do you think I'm awake right now with a cup of coffee? They already called at 6.\" Silence, then no apology, just \"we'll call at 8 - click.\" (I wonder who missed their flight that morning because they didn't get a 6AM wake up call...) Outrageous! So, I would advise anyone to stay away from this hotel, but if you must go to this hotel my advice would be: 1. Don't go at a time when it's full. (I am hoping that they're a little nicer when it's less busy) 2. Keep a journal/log of any correspondence or telephone calls you make before your trip, who you spoke with, when, what they said. - you may need it later for \"proof\". 3.

If superior service is implied in the Ritz-Carlton hotel name, then it should be delivered. Following is a letter we wrote to Ritz-Carlton after our visit - we have yet to receive any response: Dear Sir/Madam: My partner and I were presented with a Ritz-Carlton gift certificate as a Christmas gift. As we had plans to visit friends in Puerto Rico during the period from 17 to 24 March 2006, we called the Ritz 800 number and asked if we could use the certificate to spend some time one afternoon at the San Juan Ritz-Carlton pool, to order drinks and lunch - we were answered affirmatively. Shortly after our arrival at the pool at the San Juan Ritz on Thursday, 23 March 2006, we asked one of the pool staff for an umbrella, given our fair skin and the strong sun that day. We were asked immediately for our room number, upon which we explained that we were not staying at the hotel, and showed that we had a gift certificate we intended to use poolside. The umbrella was never brought, but a poolside manager was shortly sent instead to again ask us for our room number. We showed again our gift certificate and explained that we intended to use the gift for poolside drinks and lunch. The manager told us that the Ritz-Carlton gift certificates are only allowed to be used toward the price of a room, at the restaurant, spa, or gift shop. I responded to the manager that we had specifically called the 800 number in advance to ensure that we could use the certificate poolside, and further showed that there are no indications on the certificate regarding special limitations on how it could be used. The manager responded that I was wrong, that the certificates can only be used in the manner she already explained, but that she was going to \"nevertheless let us stay by the pool that day\". Instead of the pleasant experience we had expected, we were made to feel like churls who were trying to sneak into a place we were not allowed. And the pool staff refused to bring us the umbrella we had originally requested, as we \"were not room guests of the hotel\". As a VP for a Dow 30 company whose brand value is also largely defined by its promise of superior customer service, I invite you to please provide an explanation as to how our experience fits into the Ritz-Carlton definition of customer service, and how I should convey our experience to our friend who had given us the Ritz-Carlton certificate, which he believed was an especially thoughtful gift?

Having read the reviews, we knew what to expect, the good and the bad. Checking in on Sunday afternoon, a male front desk clerk said our room with two double-beds was not ready, took down my cell phone number and promised to call me in an hour and half. He did not call so I returned to the front desk at the appointed time and was told by a female desk clerk in an unpleasant, testy tone that there were absolutely no double-bed rooms available in the entire hotel and the prior desk clerk (who was no longer on duty) must have been mistaken. She also asked me what he looked like and what his name was (as if he was an imposter desk clerk??), questioning me that he had ever promised me a room. After about 30 minutes standing at the desk, instead of being outside in the sun on the first day of my vacation, (during which I overheard other recent arrivals having similar check-in problems, and people who had checked-in the day before coming to the front desk to get lunch vouchers in payment for the check-in problems they had on the prior day so there was a common problem), a \"supervisor\" suddenly was able to locate an available double-bed room, but that it wouldn't be ready for another hour so could I please give them my cell phone number? I mentioned that they already had it but they could not find it. We did finally get the promised room at around 5:30 p.m. The check-in snafu was typical. Most the staff was pleasant and helpful, but it was clear that some had not fully completed their Ritz-Carlton training class and supervision of the property and its operations seemed to be minimal and inattentive. We asked for two blankets and only one arrived. The make-up mirror in the bathroom was broken. The trash can by the desk in our bedroom was never emptied. Several of the over-worked wait staff from the outdoor grill serving the pool and beach area were noticeably not happy about their jobs. The nice young women assisting with the buffet breakfast in the lobby ($18 for Special K and a banana) were always overwhelmed. Used towels and the remains of served meals in the pool area stayed un-picked up for far too long. The beach was littered with cups, paper and other debris first thing in the morning. One mid-afternoon we went to the spa and found all 3 bathroom stalls had no toilet paper. (Something that might be seen at a turnpike rest stop but should never be a problem at a luxury hotel.) The front desk told us on the first day that the hotel was full. That should not be an excuse for mixed service and a consistently overwhelmed, over-worked, under-attentive, attitude. A well-run hotel should be able to serve a capacity crowd with top service, especially at the prices we paid. On the plus side, the food (except for breaktfast) was good, if wildly over-priced. The airplane noise was not bothersome at the beach. And the doormen and other staff in front of the hotel were uniformly helpful.

Got a great rate through my company. I was first put off by how close to the airport the hotel was (I could see it out of my window when we landed). These first jitters were immediately put off by pulling into the beautiful motor entrance at the Ritz. It was just after sunset and the entire hotel was lit up. The huge fountain in the front courtyard was very inviting and set the tone for the rest of our experience. Upon pulling up, we were greeted by the most friendly doorman I have ever come across (and I stay in a ton of 4-5 star hotels every year on business). We were escorted to checkin and were addressed by name by everyone in the lobby. Checkin was quick and efficient. Even though I was paying well over half off the going rate (my company has a killer corporate rate with Ritz Carlton), we were upgraded to a huge garden suite on the ground floor. At first I was a little concerned with a ground floor room, but was told that it was one of the few balconies in the entire hotel, and it was a very nice room. Sure enough, it was alot more than a simple balcony. It was an enormous garden area with two lounge chairs and table and chairs for four. There was a large entryway to the suite, with a half bath and small kitchen. There was a full dining room and on the other side a large living room with flat screen TV. The bedroom was a little on the smallish size, but the bed was comfortable in Ritz style, with desk, minibar, flat screen TV, its own entryway, and very large closet. The bathroom had a separate room for the toilet, one sink with tons of amenities. The only big complaint about the room was the fact there was no separate shower. This is something I have come to exspect from staying in many RCs and Four Seasons, and I was a bit put off not to find one here. The property is very nice. Because of our limited time, we did not dine in the big restaurant on property, 787 Prime, but did have drinks in the bar which was nice. At first I thought the service was very slow, but this was my New Yorkness coming through, and through the week we were down in the Carribean, I realized that life just moves at a slower pace down there. Drink prices were ok, about $14 for a top shelf cocktail. There was an ok wine list, I was exspecting a little more variety. We had breakfast in the lobby lounge, which at $17 pp was a bit pricey for what it was. The food however was very good, but it would have been more fair in the $13-14 pp range. We did have lunch at the Oceanfront grill, which was very good, and while the prices were on the high side here, it was worth it. You are overlooking a beautiful beach. The pool and beach facilities are where this property really excels. The pool service includes restaurant style pool chair seating by an attendent, which eliminates the ever annoying fighting for chairs that is so prevelent at too many resorts. The casino was nice, but I didnt bother gambling. Did not use the spa---simply not enough time. Overall, this was a very relaxing start to our vacation. Would I stay a whole week here? Id really have to think about it. There are a ton of very nice resorts in the Carribean Id try first. Dont read that as a knock against the Ritz San Juan, but I have a very been there done that attitude towards places Ive stayed. We went all over San Juan the night we were there (its a $20 ride each way into Old San Juan). After seeing a bunch of other hotels, we were very happy we stayed at the Ritz--it was by far the nicest we saw. ALot more calm and relaxing rather than in your face gambling and activity. The only hotel that caught my eye was the El Convento in Old SJ. We had dinner there and it was very nice and very special.

Ive stayed in Ritz-Carltons many times...mostly on business trips to Atlanta and many many times in New Orleans, where I travel for work all the time. The best: The pool is beautiful. The gym and the spa are also very nice. The beachside restaurant was delicious, and the bar was very nice as well. As far as amenities, this hotel is typical RC. Everything is beuatiful and very organized, the service is, in my opinion, just as it should be for 6+ bills/night for a room near the airport with a view of the ugly hotel next door. The worst: The main problem with this hotel is the constant nickel and diming and the crime situation in Puerto Rico. I felt like every time I turned around, there was another bill to sign. On our third night we took a cab to Old San Juan to check out some of the clubs, listen to some music, and feel some of the local flavor that everyone raves so much about. Very very shady. I live in freaking Jackson, MS and work in New Orleans, the street violence capital of the US. I even felt uneasy. On our cab ride back to the ritz. the taxi we rode in had a bullet hole in the front windshield (NO JOKE) It was nuts. The New Year's party at the Ritz was pathetic. Not fun at all. After paying the price for entrance to the party, we had one glass of champagne and bolted to the Hilton, which had a waaaaaaay better party, including people actually smiling, plenty of free drinks, and music that didn't sound like a broken Harry Bellafonte record. THE ABSOLUTE WORST: On our second to last day, my girlfriends diamond stud earrings and two bottles of cologne were stolen from our room. The earrings and one of the bottles of cologne were gifts that we had exchanged on our arrival. We filed a police report and a report with the hotel security. The earrings, which were $4000, were supposed to be replaced by the RC's insurance company (I had receipts). It's been months, and I haven't even been able to talk to anyone about this. They just blow me off and say that it is still \"Under Investigation\". The Bottom Line: PR is a hell hole of crime. Go somewhere else. For the same price as the RC in San Juan you can go to Caneel Bay or Nevis.

It was a quick trip, but the Ritz is a perfect place to stay for a few days in the sun. For starters, the service at this hotel is spectacular, which we have often found to be rare in \"the islands\" where most things are done on \"island time\". We received anything and everything asked for, and most of our requests were followed up by a phone call asking if everything had been taken care of satisfactorily. The only area that needs some help is the concierge desk. I was put on terminal hold a number of times when I called, and not once did they call me back with the information I was looking for. Basically I just had to leave the beach and go to the desk and get the attention of someone to help me if I wanted anything done or questions answered. This area is sorely overworked and service is lacking. Otherwise, our hotel rooms were very comfortable and quiet....ours had a fantastic view of the pool and beach (definitely worth it as the rooms on the back of the hotel face the runway of the airport). The beach and pool are lovely, although the pool can be a bit cramped, but there are chairs for all who want one. The beach is beautiful, although you do hear the planes arriving and taking off from the nearby airport which could be a problem for those looking for total peace and quiet. No problem for us. The service is good at both the pool and beach (better when these areas are not too crowded). We ate lunch on the beach or at the pool which was very convenient (good, quick food although expensive for what you get). The exercise classes (lots of them all day long) and the exercise room are great and the spa is wonderful. We played tennis a couple of days and the courts are adequate but the tennis clinic (lessons) are not really worth it. You need to stay somewhere else for better athletic facilities if you plan on playing lots of tennis or golf. This is really a \"city\" property and they are limited to a small amount of space. We only ate dinner at the hotel steak house, Prime 787, which was delicious and the service was very good. We also ate at 2 other restaurants that I can recommend, Pamelas in San Juan on the beach and at Dragonfly in OSJ....quite a scene with fantastic food. Loved them both. I think the Ritz should have a place to just pick up coffee and a bagel for breakfast (something for on the go....) but rather they only have a place to sit down and eat a full breakfast.

We found the hotel to be pretty nice. We stayed in a standard room with a pool view, and the room was comfortable and certainly large enough. The staff were very good and very nice, but the hotel was perhaps a little understaffed. We arrived at 1 pm, and our room still wasn't ready at 3 pm check in time, and we had only fair service in the restaurants. Speaking of the restaurants, they're probably our biggest area of complaint: the food (except for the sushi bar) was only fair, but prices for all food (including the sushi bar) were very high. The cold buffet offering at breakfast (includes bread, cereal, fruit) cost $17/person; a la carte two eggs any style cost $10 (toast cost extra). As for location, the hotel is walking distance to the runway at the airport, so when you're sitting out by the beautiful and otherwise tranquil pool or on the pleasant beach, you can hear planes engines roar and take off periodically. Inside the hotel, however, you can't hear a thing - the windows are well insulated. Still, I wouldn't want a room facing the airport. The area around the hotel is a bit grim. I think it must have been quite posh twenty or more years ago, as the neighboring hotels the El San Juan and the Intercontinental both look like they date from the 70's. But now the area looks a bit run down and there's not much in Isla Verde where the hotel is located. There's a Denny's next door and some divey restaurants and stores. If you don't want to eat at the Ritz (which I suggest), then it is a $14 to $19 cab ride to a decent restaurant, or a brief walk to either of the neighboring hotels which have some better offerings though no Puerto Rican food. The concierge was helpful making recommendations and reservations, but there often was a queue. One of the guys working at the pool told us to rent a car and drive to the rain forest rather than doing a tour arranged through the hotel's trip desk for $70/person. The concierge arranged the car rental for us ($36/day) and we drove there and had a great day. As for other facilities, the hotel's spa appeared to be quite nice and the gym was well equipped, and classes were offered throughout the day. When we were there, the not-very-fancy casino had open about 4 blackjack tables, one or two craps tables, some other assorted card games and two roulette tables, plus a slew of slot machines.

We had a 3rd floor room with really no view for about $800/night. The room was very standard but clean. We didn't expect to spend a substantial time in the room anyway. We just wanted to stay in a nice hotel with such amenities. Unlike the other premium hotels on the strip, the Ritz was overall quiet and only frequented by the guests of the hotel. Intercontinental and El San Juan had too much going on for my taste because of all of the attractions in the hotels. Also, the Ritz provided every service that you can possibly imagine. This allowed the guests to retreat in the hotel for the duration of their stay if they liked. The casino was nothing to write home about but if you are a gambler I guess it will be ok. I am not a gambler. The spa services were ridiculously overpriced. I am unsure if the prices quoted to me were holiday prices or everyday prices. I just believe that a manicure and pedicure for $160 is absolutely RIDICULOUS. Although it was extremely pricy for the holidays, I definitely enjoyed the Ritz.

We arrived at the hotel on a Thursday afternoon. As we stepped out of the taxi we were warmly greeted and our luggage quickly collected. In the short check-in line, tropical fruit juice and cold hand towels were waiting for us. We stayed in a standard room on the 3rd floor, which was spacious enough for myself, my wife, and our 14-month old daughter. The room had the standard comfortable beds, nice sheets, and quality bath amenities that you could expect from a Ritz, along with newly installed flat-panel TVs. We had a nice view of the gardens and some of the pool area, but had to crane our necks for the ocean view. Our requests for a refrigerator and a crib were met soon after we settled in, with an unsolicited offer from the porter to try and get us an upgraded room. Be aware that the hotel is close to the airport, so it is not a resort in the middle of nowhere, but rather an oasis in the city that might be subject to some runway noise. The beach is ok, with large hammocks and beach chairs available. The pool area is lovely, with plenty of available lounge chairs. The pool attendants were great, laying out towels, moving umbrellas and setting up the playpens/portable cribs that are available. One thing that surprised us was the number of people that went to the pool desk, got towels and avoided the attendants. Another surprise was the number of kids under 5 that were there over the weekend. We thought we'd be one of the only ones, but for those first few days, the pool area was full, with a good number of small kids. Throughout Sunday evening and Monday morning, many of the weekenders with kids packed up, and the hotel transitioned to a decidely more business, less leisure guest mix. This left the pool area more sparsly poulated and quiet for the remainder of our trip. Throughout our stay, the hotel was 95% full, but you could never tell. We found that the hotel did not nickel and dime on the whole, although there were some exceptions. For example, the hotel provided free bottled water in the rooms, with extra bottles available on request. Some items at the pool like soft drinks and fries were actually reasonable for a luxury hotel. On the other hand, the $6 ice cream bar was a bit excessive. Breakfast was $23, expensive if you are eating at home, but what you might expect at a quality hotel with a fairly comprehensive buffet. You can also order specific entrees like 2 eggs, toast and hash browns for $10, but order anything additional (juice, cereal, etc.) and it starts to make sense to pay for the buffet and have all the variety. The concierge was helpful in arranging babysitting, dinner reservations, and providing general travel information. What really made our trip was the responsive service level provided by the entire staff. We were always greeted with a warm hello or good morning. Virtually no request was refused, and service was delivered promptly and always with a smile and \"my pleasure\". To put it simply, much of the staff knew our daughter by name, and seemed to genuinely enjoy playing with her, and seeing to our needs.

We asked for late check out at 2 PM, so that we could enjoy the pool, and relax, the response was \"no problem.\" We walked the beach the afternoon we arrived, which we enjoyed. The day of departure we enjoyed the pool area, which is beautiful. I had run along the coastline, leaving the hotel after taking a left, and passing the airport. A nice option for those runners visiting the hotel. This was recommended to me by the attendant in the gym. She said that it would be fine by day, although not recommended after sunset.

We didn't make it there until about 2:30 pm and by that point, people had already long-ago staked their claim, which is fine, but the chairs that were available were unorganized and scattered.

The staff was well trained and we had no problems. The bed was very comfortable - we booked a room with pool/ocean view. The bathroom is large with lots of marble. What did upset me was that we had to wait to check in until 3pm, the room was not ready until then and we arrived around noon. They offer you the opportunity to change and hold your bags if you don't want to wait to get on the beach. I liked the beach, it was never really crowded and it did seem that a few locals went there on the weekend. The pool was beautiful, it was never really packed even on the weekend. We never had to stake a claim on a lounge, there were always plenty and very comfortable like mini-beds. There were as many towels as u needed, and the staff came around for drink orders on a pretty daily basis/ bringing chilled towels, etc. The hotel is very pretty and to me is the perfect location because its close to town. When we visited old san juan, there are a lots of places to walk around, drink and eat. The night we went in for dinner/drinks there was a definite police presence, it seems they make their rounds often in the areas that are filled with tourists. Everyone we encountered was very nice and friendly. Every restaurant we ate in was good. I would recommend Ruth Chris's, The Parrott Club and there is also an intalian place in san juan right by the main square that the cab drivers seem to bring everyone. The Metrople was very good cuban food, and its very reasonable, casual place. Its right up the street from the hotel. The Caribbean Grill for breakfast was good, a little pricey though. Restaurant out by pool on the beach was good too for lunch/drinks. Most of the reviews I read on this site were pretty accurate as far as restaurants. We discovered on our last night a lot of nice restaurants/clubs/shops - an overall nice area by the Wyndham Condado. We had dinner in an italian restaurant there that overlooked the ocean, a cute place. It seems they are really building that area up and I wish we had found it sooner. Dont be afaid to rent a car and go on your own, we took a trip to the el yunque rain forest and then to loquillo beach.

If we went back i wouldnt hesitate to go there again. Yes you can hear the planes since its near the airport but it really doesnt happen enough to be annoying. Even though youre still in the U.S., it definitely felt like youre really away, and with such a short flight its worth it.

The Ritz Carlton, however, has kept up with the times, and you'll find typical Ritz Carlton rooms (nice fabrics, clean carpets, up to date amenities and services, nice fixtures, etc.) and privacy. The hotel's pool is kept clean, the food served at the hotel is typical Ritz (not Micehlin star level, but decent resort food) and the attitude of the staff is pleasant and easygoing.

My corridor smelled oddly like cat urine (believe it or not) 3. $15- $20 each way cab ride from business district 4. Very expensive parking 5. No coffee maker in room Overall, this was a very pleasant experience. This is definitely a quality hotel; you can see that from the courteous and numerous bellhops at the front door, to the detail-oriented and attentive staff behind the check-in desks, to the top-quality/high-thread count linens in the spotlessly clean room. The hotel restaurants (as most are) are very expensive ($15 for a hamburger, and $15 for a continental breakfast). However, numerous other options are readily available. I usually ate dinner at a wonderful local establishment calld 'Ediths' (I believe). It was about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. As you exit the hotel's front door and reach the street, turn right...there are at least 5 reasonable restaurants within a 5 minute walk, as well as a well-stocked pharmacy. Ediths (in particular) had wonderful Cubanos, as well as many Puerto Rican specialties, most for well under $10. They also had $2 Coronas that you could take with you. The hotel grounds are immaculate and beautiful. Plenty of flowers, fountains, and birds. The pool was amazing. Large and temperate, it is open 24 hours, with big fluffy towels availabe at the cabana immediately next to it. There is also a nice jacuzzi in the poor area that looks out onto the beach. The beach itself was very well cared for, and in the evenings is watched over by security (we had a security gurd named Matos who was excellent, friendly and helpful...great staff all around). The ocean water is rather silty, but fine for swimming. The room was a 5-star quality room. King size bed, with great sheets and pillows, large well-equipped bathroom. The only odd lapse was that the maid forgot to give us washcloths on 2 of the days we were there. High-speed internet access is free and convenient (Take a note Hilton - If I can choose between a Hilton and the Ritz, the fact that the internet is free at the Ritz WILL make a difference to me). For some odd reason, the hallway outside my room consistently smelled like cat urine. It wasn't overwhelming, just disquieting and surprising. But that was about the only negative. Overall, this was among the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. I got a good corporate rate, and it was worth more than what I paid.

The phone was missing a filter (they couldn't explain why it hasn't been installed), the ice bucket had been forgotten, the robes were \"forgotten\" (which I am glad we said something b/c I would have likely been charged if they thought I had taken them) and as for the toilet, no explanation was given. The next day, we expected all would finally be right. Toilet again clogged, the concierge didn't do much to assist us (she was on the phone with someone who did not appear to be a guest, so we had to wait for her to finish her conversation-the other person at the concierge desk ignored us and just talked to another staff member while we stood there), and even though we called for turn down service when we headed to dinner, no turn down had been done when we returned from dinner 3 hours later! I called to complain and they apologized profusely and sent someone over...30 minutes later! Then, on our third day, my family member wanted to buy a robe, priced at over $100. After 3 phone calls requesting assistance on this matter, no one bothered to tell us that no bath robes were available. We only found that out when we proactively went to the hotel shop to find out about buying a robe. The pool was clean on the first 2 days (Friday and Saturday), but was filthy by Sunday. The oil from sun tan lotions was gathering at the edges of the pool. Since we were there during the July 4th holiday weekend, I think that the pool staff did not do enough to clean the pool throughout the day. Moreover, of the four days, on 2 days, we had towels with holes in them. There are two nice things that I wish to commend the hotel on: we were celebrating my family member's birthday and they sent a small cake to the room on our first day, free of charge. In addition, based on our nightmare experiences, they discounted our room by 50 percent for two of the four nights and permitted us to check out late afternoon (3:30 instead of the usual noon check out). Note, however, that even though the manager let us check out 3 hours later, the hotel staff did call us two times to confirm that we were leaving. Both calls came in one hour before our late check-out, around 2. So, yet again, the management does not communicate with its staff to ensure that the guest isn't inconvenienced. All in all, I would never go back. I felt like I was there to serve the staff. At least 3 times I called Guest Services and no one picked up. Although I appreciate the discount, I would have rather not gotten the discount but instead gotten excellent service. I have read many reviews of this hotel and I do see a mix. Some people absolutely love it and some hate it. I wish I could say I loved it, but my experience left a lot to be desired.", "Date": "July 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cnot impressed\u201d", "Author": "mj1234567890", "ReviewID": "UR3635683", "Content": "This is a late review, but I just found your site.

The food, the room(which had a balcony and a wonderful view of the court yard where the pool was), room service, house keeping, the casino..EVERYTHING!! The floor we stayed on was a private floor. The only way to this floor was to use your room key on the elevator... this floor had a beautiful concierge lounge that had wonderful food and as many drinks(fountain as well as alcoholic beverage) at no price. This was also a highlight of our stay because we could fill ourselves up with the goodies from the lounge and be alright until lunch, or dinner. The lounge hours were great and the hosts and hostesses were very polite and very attentive. The view was also gorgeous from the balcony too! Oh and one thing we absolutely loved, was that we never had to wonder how we would get around. There was always a taxi ready and willing to take you anywhere you needed to go and it was normally a very good price! The Ritz Carlton is the place to go if you ask me!!

And San Juan is not Oahu. There are not pretty flowers on the corners of pedestrian friendly streets, no high-end shops to pick up a Hermes bag or Burberry suit. San Juan is a gritty city. You will walk past drunks/peddlers/homeless on the way to find dinner/lunch outside the hotel. That being said, San Juan really is a fabulous city and we had a great time during our visit (just got back last Saturday after a week's stay.) San Juan is a little like New Orleans...a bit raw, but still a lot of fun. On the Ritz itself: Our room was a nice, normal hotel room. Nothing fancy, no balconies (there are very few at this hotel, and none of the windows open), nice bathroom, decent view (partial ocean, partial parking lot.) Staff was great. Lady in the lobby kept giving our son a balloon when we came down to watch the bands in the lobby, hang out before dinner, etc. They also have board games, which came in handy during the rains we got. Beach is average. The water is SANDY, not dirty--the water's just a slight bit choppy where the waves hit, and it kicks up a lot of sand. Once you go past where the waives break, it's not sandy anymore. We thought the pool was great, and spent most our time there (when it wasn't raining). They did have to close the pool for cleaning when it finally was sunny, because flooding had dirtied it all up. Use the concierge service, they recommended almost all the places we ate at outside of the hotel. They have a big book of menus that comes in handy for browsing. The area: We loved Old San Juan, great places to eat there everywhere, and parking is easy in the two main parking garages. There is some high end shopping in Old San Juan, and locals selling all sort of things. Places we ate in Old San Juan: lunch at The Parrot Club was great--a casual, yuppy atmosphere. Had dinner at a GREAT Italian place called Fratello's. A bit more formal, we felt slightly uncomfortable in jeans, but the food was fabulous. Also had dinner at El Picateo in the El Convento Hotel. It's a great tapas restaurant in the courtyard of this beautiful little botique hotel. Other places by the hotel where we ate were equally great. Everything is walkable, but again, it's not really set up for pedestrian traffic. We ate at the Metropol, which is across the street practically. Was delicious. Also ate dinner at Lupis, a local Mexican chain. Ate lunch there too, a great (relatively) cheap place to go, away from the hotel. We walked to the Wyndham down the street for dinner on the top floor at The Tequila Bar and grill. Great views of the city/beach from there. Ate lunch at Ciao Mediterranean at the InterContinental, also within walking distance. We had a bit of a hard time finding it within the hotel at first...it is literally on the beach. The place we ate our last night in San Juan was Pamela's in the Numbero Uno Beach House. It's a 5-8 minute drive, but well worth it. It's in a gated community in this little house on the beach. You park where the road dead ends, and the house is on the right. You feel like you are in the wrong place, but you're not. We brought our 1 1/2 year old to all the places we ate, all were child friendly, even the more \"fancy\" ones. Our son loved all the fruit punch served in PR, all actually mixed on request, no bottled, pre-made. And usually came with cherries and/or pineapples which he though was pretty cool. We ate a few times at the Ritz, but lunch for two adults and one child was $70. So most times we ate elsewhere. Also stopped by the local Pueblo grocery store down the road and bought milk for our toddler (kept it in the minibar), and Corona & tequila and margarita mix for the adults. (Drinks at hotel range from $10-$14 a pop.) If you are looking for a more natural setting, you'd be better off on the east side of the island, by Luquillo beach (we didn't get to go, but is supposedly THE most beautiful beach on the island.) El Conquistador and the Westin Rio Del Mar are over in that area. Downside to those places are there aren't as many fabulous places to eat outside of the pricey hotel restaurants. Next time I'd like to split our stay between both areas. If you like outdoors, definately take a trip to El Yunque Rainforest. Don't bother with the tour groups if you have a car, its very tourist friendly and the visitors center has maps, etc. and you can then drive to and choose which trailhead you want to hike. You can also look up the trails on the website for the park.

We are frequent Ritz Carlton vacationers so I do have a good basis for comparison. Some of my disappointments could have been avoided by doing a better job of assessing the whole san juan situation. THe Ritz sits on the ocean and you can look out certain windows of the property and see the landing strip of the airport. We never heard planes while inside our room but did hear them outside by the pool area. The sound varied depending upon the traffic route. I think I was expecting Isla Verde to be a little bit more like Cancun- I knew it would have more of an urgan 'strip' hotel feel but was really disappointed by the neighborhood the Ritz is in. Tons of litter in areas outside the Ritz, sidewalks not easily navigatable. We walked to the El SAn Juan and my 9 year old had to literally step over a drunk guy whose feet were sticking out of an alley. (and this was 10 am) I will never return to SAn Juan, although it is convenient in terms of travel and timing. The beach is not stellar. It is not a 'walkable' beach and the sand is brown and the water not clear. Just not a pretty beach. This does not compare with other beaches we have been to. The pool area was okay, but actually not as impressive as others. There were always seats to be had, although the seats themselves are packed pretty tightly together and in rows. I thought the water temperature in the pool was fine. We had booked an Executive suite at $975 a night. Our view was really high rise (and often) run down apartment buildings or other resorts. The bedroom area was beautiful but the living room area was not as attractive. Only in picture and the rest bare walls. A low level cabiner holding a TV, so that the top of the TV was no higher than the top of the coffee table. Why didn't they just use the taller units that are found in the bedrooms. The sofa can convert to a sofa bed, but was not comfortable at all if using as an actual sofa. We asked to be switched and booked 2 adjoining oceanview rooms for a bit more money. The front desk staff handled this very well. However, when we checked out they had continued to charge us $975 plus $489 for the second room. The King bedded room should have been $600. This took a while to manually rectify at checkout. Our cleaning and turn down service was fabulous. We also tip every day and I think that makes a big difference. So I had no issues at all with the housekeeping staff. I am really picky about restaurants- the food at Prime 787 was wonderful and the service was really some of the best I have had. It is expensive but really made our stay. We ended up eating there 4 or 5 nights. The service at the outside pool/beach bar was not good. The bartenders were not that helpful or friendly. Often we would be there for opening at 10:30 am to get sodas etc and they would tell us they needed to find ice, couldn't open for another 20 minutes. Others said they got great service by attendants pool-side but we didn't see much of that during our stay. Again, I am comparing this to other Ritz properties. The sushi was pretty good but the Chinese food was really terrible. Outside bathrooms by the pool were dirty and not maintained throughout the day. The Spa was fabulous. The only downside is there is no inside route to the spa, you have to leave the hotel and walk outside. Over 7 days of huge rain this became a bit annoying, but the service was outstanding. Great workout room and hourly exercise classes etc.. Our son is 9 years old and although the Ritz Kids club is supposed to be for 5-12, the activities were not age appropriate. The staff is delightful however. So I think if your kids are younger they would love it. Our son didn't want to go after the first morning. When he went there was one first grader and two 3rd graders and when I arrived they were making paper native american head dresses. My son thought that was a little 'baby-ish.' But I want to reiterate, the staff there was wonderful. The casino was fun but people weren't tripping over themselves to provide food or drinks. Through no fault of the staff at the Ritz, we had horrible weather during our entire stay. Unusual amount of rain and flash flood warnings. Many times torrential down pours. Roads in Old San Juan were flooded. You couldn't spend the afternoons by the pool or on the beach. By the end of the stay the pool area became flooded and they had to close the pool entirely. I think given the fact that the rain there was front page news and the forecast was projecting 8 or 9 straight days of rain, they could have tried to creatively come up with other activities. Keep in mind, noone wants to sightsee outside when it is thunder and lightening. Even employees were telling us to stay on property. There was bingo and salsa dancing lessons but these are held inside the casino, so kids can't join in. There were also large groups of convention folks, who were traveling at rates of $200/night. This created quite a bit of congestion in the breakfast dining room. One morning we were told it would be a 20 minute wait for a table. We went down the street to Denny's, lol.

We decided to slurge on a room in the Ritz Carlton Club and paid 865.00 per night, 85.00 p/d in resort fees(total BS if you ask me) and then the tax for a whopping amount of almost 1,100.00 per night. We had a late flight coming in and were told by the conceirge that the club would be open until 11;30pm that night serving drinks and snacks. When we got there at 10;00pm it was closed up like a drum. So we were relegated to the lounge bar and spent 100.00 on 2 glasses each for some cheap rot- gut wine. Now off we go for a snack... We were told a Chinese restaurant was open in the casino. We were seated by a surly chinese MaitreD' to see 18.00 for a bowl of won ton soup and 9.00 for one eggroll. I mean--we are sports when traveling but COME ON! Needless to say, we got up and walked out. Casino was nice but the machines were fixed that you never received ANY coins back to play. 20.00 literally went in 5 minutes. This happened the next night as well and to all the people around us and to those with whom I spoke. Look...I expect to lose, but usually you get a few coins back here and there to keep you playing for a while. Forget it here! The greed of the Casino is overwhelming. So we did not go back for the rest of our trip. Too bad too, because my husband and I enjoy playing a little bit each night after dinner. Got to our room and A/c was broken. Men tried until 3:00am to fix it to no avail. Hotel had no where to move us so we literally sweat it out our first night. They fixed it the next day but we could not used our room until 4:00pm cause it was filled with workmen and saws and ladders. The main window was so dirty that you could not tell if it was sunny or rainy outside. The terrace was never cleaned of all the bird droppings,our plasma Tv sound remained broken for our stay, the toilet overflowed and the shower flooded the bathroom if you did not stand a certain way. Maid never replenished our towels and soap even after we asked our dour faced maid nicely for a bar of soap. Turn down service left all dirty towels in our room and maid left candy wrappers for us to throw away. The Club presentations were nothing like the Club in Cancun. Breakfast was just some buns and fatty cold cuts. Lunch ws the nicest food display of the day with beautiful fresh salads, cold cuts etc.. Cleanliness was an issue here in the club as well. Glass was ridden with childrens sticky fingerprints never to be cleaned. Tables not wiped down after use. The men in the morning wore the same filthy uniform siuts with dried crusted food on them for our entire stay.Also they both had head colds, and one of then kept wiping his nose with his bare hand and then going around handling all the food displays. Needless to say, I caught a vicious brochial cold and it cost me 210.00 to see the hotel docteor. Many people around us at the club began sneezing and coughing as well. Spa was very poorly maintained with the shower, jacuzzi and steam room remaining broken for half our stay. Notice they did not reduce our resort fee for lack of services. And all employees expected tips from opening doors to laying down a towel. On the plus side, the gardens, lobby and public aresa were beautiful. Beach was nice as was the service. They came around with cold towels and frozen fruit to enjoy. The only problem was they came to take your beach umbrella away at aound 4;00pm and if you were napping as I was, you realized you had no umbrella until you awoke with a sunburn as I did!

Pros: Finest hotel in Puerto Rico, without question. Service is fantastic, Resort has very nice outdoor area with pool and lush gardens. It is the first hotel out of the airport, which makes for easy quick getaway. Lots of activities and tours daily. Kid-friendly, in Ritz-Carlton style. Very nice spa facility with a great gym, many classes daily & tennis courts. An oasis in Isla Verde. Cons: Puerto Rico is not the finest island in the Carribean. The resort understandably attracts lots of families and is not a great romantic getaway for a couple. Many people are there on a corporate rate of $210/night. Casino attracts more locals than tourists. Beach & pool area can get very crowded on busy weekends. Rooms are very nice, but not as high-end as you might expect. Resort fee and taxes will run $100 additional/day. Be aware, there are many aggressive travelers (read: New Yorkers) staying at this hotel (of which I am one with a bit of self-awareness).

The intercontinental hotel, which we walked to from the ritz (~5-10min walk) houses ruth's chris steak house and momoyama japanese cuisine, both very good. The 101 lounge is a nice little hole in the wall type bar right next to the ritz. Great for grabbing a drink at about 1/8th the price of the ritz, literally. lupis is a mexican/sport bar restaurant about two or so blocks from the ritz, again, good food and great price. They also had a cover band playing when we went and seemed to have good music other nights when we walked by. Walking to these areas we felt safe as there always seemed to be a police presence.

Although I rate the hotel five stars (excellent) on the rating scale, I did so only because the four star rating is for above average and in my opinion the hotel is closer to excellent than above average. Prior to arriving at the Ritz, we stayed two nights at the Marriott in Condado Beach. Although the Marriott now owns and/operates the Ritz Carlton chain, there is no comparison between the two properties. With that said, we did have an oceanfront room at the Marriott (which allowed us to sleep with the balcony doors open) and were unable to get one at the Ritz. However, that turned out to be a blessing in disguise. With the exception of a few rooms at the Ritz, none of them have balconies and the windows do not open and we were on the so-called garden-view side of the hotel at $550.00/night and the rooms facing the water were even pricier with no real added benefit. Some reviews talked about the hotel's proximity to the airport which is great when arriving and leaving any really had little, if any, effect on our stay. Although you could hear the occasional airplane taking off when at the pool, it was not a negative. Everthing that others are writing about the hotel is pretty accurate. The staff is as friendly as can be, the hotel and grounds are immaculate, the bathrooms and rooms are very nice and meals at the hotel are expensive. We were somewhat disappointed that our room (612) had a large coffee stain in the middle of the carpet and the carpet in general was somewhat dirty but after pointing this out, someone from the hotel quickly came and scrubbed out much of the coffee stain but truth be told, the entire carpet really needed to be cleaned. We had dinner two nights in the lobby restaurant which also allows you to order from the Chinese restaurant in the casino which we could not eat at because the kids are not allowed in the casino. The first dinner was great but the dinner order the second time was completely messed up (after waiting almost an hour to get it) and the hotel insisted on not charging us for the dinner which was nice. My only real complaint is that the pool did not appear to be heated and was very cold. In fact, the only people in the pool were kids and most guests (including the kids) simply used the jacuzzi. Perhaps in the summer a heated pool is unnecessary but not so in February.

We decided on it because she is 3 months pregnant and we wanted something easier to get too. GOOD POINTS- Easy access. From the mainland US Puerto Rico is an easy flight with a great deal flexibility. It is a very easy trip to the airport, just a 5 minute ride(watch the cabbies we were informed it shoul dbe an $8 cab ride but we were charged $18 going and $14 going back). Easy to keep in touch. My Blackberry worked and US cell phones worked there. If someone wants to go away and be able to easily keep in touch with work, this place is great for it. The hotel also gets all US TV stations so you can even keep up with your favorite shows. Nice Pool area- The Pool area was really nice and very realxing. The chairs are those nice ones with the padding. On any given day many people were taking naps and it was a mellow relaxed atmosphere. There is a great deal of shade in the pool area between the palm trees and the hotel itself. When we wanted more sun, we went to the sunnier beach. Service- The concierge was great. They recommneded restaurants, made reservations etc.. In general the staff was great except at the restaurants. They were clueless and slow for breakfast and lunch. We did not eat at the Vineyard(the fancy restaurant) it was closed while we were there. Bad Points The beach- In general the beach area was just ok. It was not the nice exotic looking beaches that one sees in other parts of the caribbean. My wife and I enjoy taking long strolls on the beach and it was just not that nice. Value- We had a very nice time but I did not think the cost of the trip was really worth it. We go the caribbean every year and I tohught we got better value in everything from the trip to dinners elsewhere. Good to know- Location- The hotel is literally next to airport. It is convenient but you hear and see every plane take off. That diminishes from the ambiance a great deal. This is also not an exotic locale by any means. The hotel is in an urban area close to the airport that just happens to be on the beach. The El San Juan is a 5 minute walk and the interconital a 10 minute walk. The EL San Juan has an interesting scene on Friday and Saturday nights. While the hotel is an an urban area outside of the restaurants in the hotels, there are no restaurants recommneded by the hotel within walking distance(there is a local one but anywhere you can get a steak for 9.99 makes me scared.) Anyway cabs can add up from there, we spent over $130 on cabs while in PR and that was just trips to the airport, Condado($14), Old San Juan($16) and a few other local ones. Restaurants- In general were good but not great. My favorite was Pamelas. We also went to Baru in old san juan good, Ajili-Mojilio my wife liked, I thought just ok. We went to the Italian and the Japanese in the El San Juan both decent but not great. Spa- seemed nice but we did not use it, Casino beat me up too much. The Casino was nice and they either had entertainmnet in the Casino or in the Lobby Lounge. In general we had a great time but I like a more exotic locale and I thought it was not the best value for the $$$.

Ate at one of the hotel restaurants, Carribean Grill, for lunch. It was ok and the cost was silly. lunch for two was $60, I had a burger and wife had a salad. Two great restaurants to go to in San Juan are Pikayo (in the musuem of art). It is amazing, i compare it to Jean George in NYC. The other is Tangerine in the Waterclub Hotel.

First of all, the hotel itself is quite pretty, with the lobby area greeting you with full views of the pool area through floor-to-ceiling glass windows about two stories high. The pool area was very nice and we didn't have any problems finding 4 lounge chairs on our own ,or on saturday and sunday with the help of one of the pool attendants (never neglecting their gratuity, of course). My husband and his best friend really enjoyed the beach and commented how clean and pleasant it was. We celebrated my husband's 29th birthday on sunday and found the Sunday Brunch at The Caribbean Grill excellent, and our waiter even made us a special array of desserts with a candle and a personalized birthday wish. We also got a chance to have some services at the spa, which was fine but not what you'd expect from The Ritz Carlton chain. As far as food is concerned, we ate at both the restaurant by the beach (can't remember the name) and The Caribbean Grill and found the food well prepared and delicious. Previous reviews have mentioned prices to be high, which may be somewhat true if you don't keep reminding yourself that you are on vacation and that these prices are somewhat expected for any high-end resort. If you are in San Juan you really have your pick of some really good food, we visited several restaurants and found La Piccola Fontana (in The Wyndham El San Juan), Ajili Mojili (in Condado), Casa Borinquen and Dragonfly (both in Old San Juan) all to be excellent, and all with such different flare!. Apart from housekeeping which was somewhat inconsistent , the service at The Ritz is excellent. The staff from the bellmen, front desk, conceirge and wait staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Now on to our only problem with our stay, from our first walk into our balcony room (# 354) we noticed an awful mildew or mold-like smell. The room was very well appointed and of a nice size, and this lingering smell seem to be coming from the carpet. On our second day we called housekeeping to ask if something could be done about the smell and because we noticed that the carpet had not been vacummed since we got there. The lady on the phone was very polite and apologetic and within 10 minutes there was a housekeeper at our room, vacum in hand and with a very strong but pleasant room deodorizing spray. The smell persisted and on our last night there we were awaken by a big leak in the ceiling in the entrance area. Engineering came to our room about twenty minutes after our phone call to Guest Services and without even coming into our room, which obviously shows that they were previously aware of this problem, informed us that it would be taking them a very long time to deal with the problem and that we should call the front desk and have our room switched. After packing, we were moved to the 7th floor and our room (# 757) was spotless. We were allowed a 3 o'clock check out after reminding the front desk of our switch, but no one offer any apologies furthermore.

The previous reviews of this and other San Juan hotels left us puzzled, so I thought I'd try to provide the straight scoop. This is a very fine URBAN resort hotel, with a pleasant beach attached as a bonus. There is no question that this is the finest hotel in San Juan, and the staff is well trained and generally eager to provide a lovely experience. As an added bonus, the hotel is a pleasant five-minute walk from the El San Juan, which has fabulous nightlife in its elegant lobby. BUT: This is not the Caribbean resort of your dreams -- it is basically urban. If you need or want to stay in San Juan itself (as we did) this is beyond any dispute the finest choice you could make. (The closest competitors in San Juan, such as the Marriott or the Water Club, are pale imitations of the Ritz and nowhere near as nice.) However, Puerto Rico does offer many other high-end \"beach resorts\" some distance away -- typically, 1-2 hours drive outside of San Juan. If you're looking for a typical luxury Caribbean resort, you may be happier at one of those choices (Horned Dorset, Wyndham in Farjado, etc.). If you have already decided in stay in San Juan itself, howver, the Ritz is absolutely your best choice.

We saw many of the negative write-ups and were frankly nervous about our stay, but in our opinion they were completely unfounded. Our room was ocean view, without a balcony. It was great, what you would expect for $400 a night. The staff was extremely courteous, no matter what I asked for they would respond It will be my pleasure and they delivered time and time again. While it was not over run by children, it was very child friendly (2 of which were ours) and the staff (especially the concierge and their staff) were fantastic. The rooms were cleaned and turned down perfectly. Yes you can hear and see every airplane that takes off from San Juan International but that is because you are 20 minutes from the airport and there are no large buildings blocking the coast. The beach was very clean (the sand is brown not dirty), when there was high winds or heavy rain seaweed would wash ashore but it was always clean the next morning and in clear weather the water was crystal clear blue. If there is one thing I would say is that the Caribbean Grill (on the beach) was a little slow but with that scenery, the wonderful sunny skies, cool breeze and ice cold Pina Colada- who cares.

We found all the staff to be very helpful and friendly, always greeting us with a smile. The property was beautiful, especially the pool area and lobby. It is true that the rooms could use some updating - especially new carpet - but our room and bathroom was large (at least for our NYC standards), comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. We had no trouble getting a king size bed, and another reviewer put it nicely, it was \"like sleeping on a cloud\". On the weekdays, housekeeping was a little slow to get to our room (twice it was not done by 4pm), one night we did not receive turndown service, and I had to call to get new bathrobes when housekeeping removed them and forgot to replace. This didn't bother us too much since we were rarely in the room during the day, and during the weekend the housekeeping staff was much more on top of it. The pool area was indeed crowded, but we were always able to find chairs (even getting there late morning/early afternoon). There is some airplane noise on the beach, less at the pool, and we never noticed it inside the hotel. The beach is beautiful, but windy - at least when we were there - and they have nice hammocks set up under the palms. We did not eat dinner at the hotel restaurants, preferring to head into Old San Juan, but the breakfast at the Caribbean Grill was always delicious. Also had very tasty Cuban food at Metropole (5 min. walk from hotel) - and for $35 for two people, dinner, beer, and dessert, it's a great deal for a casual meal. The nightlife at the Ritz is pretty quiet, except for the casino on the weekend. However, a very happening bar/nightclub scene is only a short walk away at the El San Juan. That was a fun place to spend an evening, but I don't think I'd want to stay there as a guest. Overall, the Ritz was exactly what we were looking for - a peaceful, beautiful place to enjoy the sun and be pampered. For us, the few problems were merely momentary annoyances, and did not affect our enjoyment of the vacation.

If you like looking at air conditionier units and repair men on the roof then this room was great. When the manager tried to accomodate me with a king bed with a mountain view, I viewed the room and saw that I was basically looking at the airport with planes landing every 15 minutes. The property is small and there is not too much to do. The only benefit is that you are close to San Juan. Do yourself a favor and do not stay at this hotel. for 400 a night you can do much better.

My summary is that the accomodations are first class, service by front desk, concierge, bellmen and housekeeping are excellent but not without some problems. The only place I found average service was at the ocean/poolside restaurant staff...they were ok but not up to Ritz standards. You will find certain things annoying for this class of hotel like...I went to the fitness center and two of the open treadmills were not working (apparantly broken)..so I told the guy and he could not get them working so he said he will get them repaired...after several other people tried to use them until I told him he needed to put a \"broken\" sign on them. I promised my kids pasta for dinner at the poolside restaurant..come dinner time we ordered and they told us it would take over an hour so I convinced my kids to get a hamburger and they could have ice cream but later...no ice cream. I made a valentines dinner reservation a month in advance at the signature restaurant at the hotel \"the Vinyard\"..come 5:00 on Valentines day I go to find out if my reservation was for 7 or 7:30...they tell me they don't have me listed and there is no room. I was livid but I must say, they tried to do all they possibly could and they got me in someplace else, gave me transportation, etc. All in all, don't expect the same great Ritz service everywhere in the Hotel but mostly it is very good. The pool is great, especially for kids (only 3- 3.5 feet deep and they give you pool floats) One thing is to get up a reserve your pool chair early since it gets crowded. The beach is also nice...great sand and shallow water..but while we were there a little windy and shallow waves. The Ritz will get you a beach chair and umbrella and offers sailboats, kayaks, etc. for free use (included, among other things, in the 10% resort fee surcharge they started charging in 2004). The spa and fitness center is very nice...bring your wallet...but good things cost $ ..right?? Almost everybody uses it, especially for the signature messages. The casino and lobby bar is faily quiet during the week and gets busier on the weekend. You will see tourists and locals in the casino on the weekend. Over at the El San Juan hotel that place is really hopping all the time and you will see lots of locals, hear spanish bands and people are dancing in the smokey lobby. The csino is also more crowded and smokey than the Ritz. I recommend a visit to the El San Juan but its nice to visit and then come back to the Ritz. Since food is very expensive at the Ritz, Denny's for breakfast is great and right around the corner. What we paid at denny's for 3 adults and two children bought one breakfast buffet at the Ritz (22.50). However, the Ritz does not have any other outside restaurants closeby.. you will have to walk or take a cab to get to other restauarants. The El San Juan/Intercontinental are farther down and accross from some fast food places (pizza hut, wendys, burger king) and a grocery store (where you can buy some water/soda/yogurt/cereal etc. for the room, otherwise you will pay $$$ at the Ritz). These hotels are maybe a 10 minute walk from the Ritz. The restaurants at the El San Juan are very good and more to our liking than the Ritz. The Italian restaurant Piccolo is especially good. The Intercontinental has a Ruth Cris steakhouse but with the Kids we went to the Outback at the Embassy Suites (15 minute walk from Ritz/ 5 minutes from El San Juan hotel). The Ritz is very close to the airport and although at times the planes taking off are very loud, you don't notice it when out by the beach or pool and at night the sound is very muffled by the soundproofing built into the hotel...all in all.. the noise was not an issue. The El San Juan and Intercontinental hotels are further down the road so I imagine noise is less of an issue. The Ritz rooms are very, very nice (especially the bathrooms) and small/average size. Great bed and Frette linens for superior comfort. The Intercontinental is an older hotel and rooms not nearly as nice. If I was going back, I would still stay at the Ritz (even with the Valentines day fiasco). The only way I can see people bad mouthing this place is because they are used to flawless service (usually found at the Ritz) and anything else is a disappointment....but if you can overlook some service issues and the price of drinks and food, you will have a wonderful time!!", "Date": "February 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cWe were extremely impressed!!\u201d", "Author": "gerryjets", "ReviewID": "UR1625355", "Content": "Me and my wife were very nervous about coming here after reading the reviews.
