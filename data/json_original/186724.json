{"Reviews": [{"Content": "good choice near the airport My husband and me stayed in the Holiday Inn for one night. We chose this hotel since it seemed closed to the airport and we arrived in the night and had to take the next flight early next morning. It was a bit diffult to find the bus shuttle. Look for the office of the holiday in in Terminal 2 in the lower floor. If the shuttle bus is not there, they will call it for you and you can wait in the office. The good thing is that it is 24h and on the way back, it drops you at the gate you want. Calculate approx. 20min time with the shuttle. The hotel itself was very nice, friendly staff and the restaurant was open 24h. The hotel is a good choice if you arrive at Mexico City and have to take another flight the next day.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR547603859", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Terence_Hill"}, {"Content": "Very good for the price Very good service, very clean, very safe.

The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly, but it is not at the airport, which is very disappointing if you are looking to sleep a couple of hours and have to spend probably 15 minutes each way on a shuttle at 2am. The area is not for tourists. We do not have complains of the hotel (not had that much time) the only thing was that we booked it as an airport hotel and is not. Better choice inside Mexico City Airport is the Hilton, and right across the street we saw the Camino Real and a Fiesta Inn.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR563456814", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "miralta"}, {"Content": "A Great Place to Stay       Buffet", "Date": "Sep 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR639651903", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Robojoe"}, {"Content": "Excellent option near airport I was in this hotel for a one-night stopover.First, let me say this is not exactly an airport hotel. It's a kind of ugly concrete building in a non-descript area of Mexico City, next to a big supermarket. Definitely neither a tourist zone nor a major business district. It's further from the airport than the other 'airport' hotels - but that's not really a problem with the free shuttle (10 or 15 minute ride) and it's much cheaper than the on-airport hotels.The rooms are not particularly modern but are clean and comfortable. I also had a room with a big jacuzzi tub with the jets deactivated, and a notice in English and Spanish to inform me of that fact. Maybe they are trying to save electricity, but this did rather mystify me. This hotel must have huge water bills. I just took a shower as I could see the tub was going to take a long time to fill up and I was short on time.I really like that there was an iron and ironing board in the room. That's something other hotels in the price range (like Fiesta Inn Aeropuerto where I have also stayed) don't offer. Instead they (Fiesta Inn) offer free pressing but you have to call in business hours, wait for someone to come, be hassled for tips etc which is going to take at least half an hour. Much easier just to iron out the creases in your own shirt in 2 mins in the middle of the night before you go to sleep.But what is really outstanding about this hotel is the service. I was really impressed by how friendly and open all the staff I experienced were. Although I didn't meet the manager, he or she is obviously very attentive and pays attention to those small details that matter. It seemed like a we're #2 so we try harder situation.In particular they were very accommodating on a special request/service we asked for. Full marks for excellent service.There was wireless internet available free in my room, though the signal was a little weak and disconnected from time to time so if you specially need this (I didn't) I would ask for a room close to wherever their base station or repeater is.One warning: in the airport arrivals area, taxi touts told me that this Holiday Inn does not offer free shuttle service and tried to confuse me that there were 5 Holiday Inns in Mexico City and the one I had chosen did not offer transport. This was a lie which fortunately I didn't fall for but others might. I mentioned it to the HI transport girl but she didn't seem very interested. If I were management of this hotel, I would be complaining to airport security about this little scam.Anyway, I will definitely return to this hotel. I travel through Mexico City quite frequently and this is a convenient and good value stopover hotel.", "Date": "Mar 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR690649632", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "nico_mbe"}, {"Content": "Very convenient, clean Great location just 10 minutes from the airport.

Have stayed there three times in the last month. Not too far from the airport, the hotel's free hourly shuttle is a big bonus for me. You may meet the hotel greeter at the Mexico City airport at Door #2 ( look for the young lady holding the Holiday Inn Oriente ( East ) sign.Rooms are very clean and comfortable.

A Mega food store is across the street, and nearby are a Vips and the ubiquitous Wal-Mart.I'll stay here again.", "Date": "Jul 8, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR609088994", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Good service; hard beds Very nice, clean hotel. The service, especially in the Hacienda Restaurant, is excellent. At least one member of the front desk staff speaks english. They offer a free shuttle van to and from the airport.
