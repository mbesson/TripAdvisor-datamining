Being in a more local neighbourhood also meant that there were plenthy of cheaper bars and places to eat (handy as we didn't have breakfast included with the hotel). The staff spoke good English and were alway very helpful, and the room was very clean. Although the bedroom was small, it did have a TV and a good size bathroom. However, there were unfrounately two main issues, which have been highlighed in other reviews. THe first problem was that we had one of the dreaded \"courtyard\" rooms. This meant no outside light, or air. The room was always pitch black and felt stuffy - we had to set an alarm as it was completely black in the room at 10am! The other problem was also the door slamming. It is impossible to close the door without slamming it, and this went on throughout the night. Although we did get used to it, it made the first night's sleep very difficult, and this together with the dark room did put a bit of a dampener on an otherwise very pleasant hotel.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Shields, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood, Very clean & friendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "Southshields_DAVE", "ReviewID": "UR83149682", "Content": "This is hotel is in a good location if you are travelling into Barcelona by air as it is only 10 mins walk from the main train station in Barcelona, Estacio Sants, In which you can get the renfe train direct from the airport Terminal 2 into Barcelona Sants, Train takes about 20 mins and only 3.00 euro's each way, Yes, As per other reviews, The hotel is out of the city and about 25 mins walk from the main tourist areas, Las Ramblas, Passaig de gracia, Placa de catalunya etc.., However, This reflects in the great very favourable online rates, Although the walk into the city is quite pleasant as it is along a main road with stacks of bars, cafes, eateries etc...., However, Rocafort metro station is only 2 blocks away approx 5 mins walk which from there is then only 3 stops into the main city metro Catalunya, 2.40 euro's each way or T-dia ticket is 6.00 euro's and you can have unlimited travel for one day in order to sweep up all the tourist sites and the metro's run until 2.00am,This hotel is at the right end of the city for Font Magica and the Olympic stadium which are only 10 mins walk away, Overall, Very clean, Friendly and very competitive online rates, Very much reccomended and would definately stay again if in Barcelona.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cClean and Friendly, but not in the heart of the city - not a bad thing!\u201d", "Author": "KimbK", "ReviewID": "UR64211525", "Content": "We had a great stay!

Unfortunately we got an interior room on the first floor, depressingly dark, looking onto some sort of covered courtyard almost devoid of natural light. It was not exactly the world\u2019s biggest room either, with barely enough space to walk around the bed, and just one bedside table. The bathroom was a more decent size, oddly fitted with two separate sinks (perhaps too pretentious for such a small room, we thought). Sound proofing seemed a bit of a problem too: from our bathroom we could hear a pin drop in the bathroom next door. Not a pleasant experience. Ouch! The cold buffet breakfast was definitely the highlight of our stay. There were cereals, yoghurt, cold meat and cheese cuts, a selection of freshly cooked pastries (delicious), fruit and fruit drinks (lovely peach juice), plus tea or coffee on request, and free newspapers.

The hotel was easy to reach from the Arc De Triomph bus station (which connects to the Barcelona Girona airport) and it is less than a 10 minutes walk from the nearest Metro station. There are 3 Metro stations close by, along with Sant railway station. From the nearest Metro station, it is about 10 minutes to Las Ramblas (on the Metro) and about 20 minutes walk.

The pics shown are accurately descriptive of the hotel, and the receptionist staff were all very friendly and instantly provided us with bus timetables when requested. The best thing about the hotel was the breakfast which came included within the price. It was a buffet breakfast, and consisted of pastries, croissants, cereals, yoghurts and drinks, juices, fruits, cold meats, scrambled eggs and chorizos.
