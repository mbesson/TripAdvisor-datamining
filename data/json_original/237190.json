They didn't have any safety boxes for us to leave valuables in so took the chance of leaving money and gear in the room when we went out. Beds made when we came back and everything in its place.

Trying to make the best of a bad situation I entered this hotel with an open mind. Unfortunately this was just the continuation of my nightmare, The hotel was very old and not well kept in the slightest, the toilet was broken, there was wires hanging out of the walls and the shower was flithy. At this stage all I wanted was just a good nights sleep and to start fresh in the morning... this however was made impossible by the camp style beds, it felt like sleeping on a mat on the floor. I imagine this is what 1 room shacks must look like after they have been abandoned. We decided the next morning that we would look for another hotel after breakfast (which we had paid for but did not receive). The bright side of this hotel however is its location we were ten mins away from a train station and in the city so we had some nice bars and restaurants around us. When we returned to our hotel that evening to check out and retrieve our bags we were HORRIFIED that there were guests already settling into our room before we had even checked out. Our bags and personal belongings including passports could have been damaged or stolen, and the hotel did not so much as apologise. Unprofessional is too light of a word to use.

My wife went down to get some but the young guy in the lobby, now alone, said he could not leave his post to get towels. I had to dry off with my clothes.

The bathroom flooded, with horrible faeculent material coming up onto the floor. The smell was nearly unbearable. We had to be asked to move rooms. The staff were not as helpful as you would hope, when you have young kids. The breakfast room was miserable in size, and could not cope with numbers. The photos on the website are very misleading. In fact, I see on another website that they use photos from a DIFFERENT hotel in the same building. Awful place overall! Prob one of the worst places I've ever stayed, and I've stayed in rough places!

Dark and dingy, miserable rooms, lacking reasonable hotel comforts such as decent towels, plug sockets that were securely fixed to the walls, a remote control for the TV. This was truly like a basic hostel rather than a hotel costing 120 euros a night for a double room. I know it's Rome - but still felt ripped off.. First night had a cold shower due to the \"pilot\" light going out on the boiler. The second evening - same cold shower, but this time the disinterested staff couldn't even be bothered to come up with an excuse. Following morning, a lukewarm shower, presumably because a few other guests got up earlier and beat me to it!

Good points of the hotel include: Central location Cleanliness Friendly and helpful staff However, some bad points as well: The place needs some serious re-docration, there was plaster peeling of the walls in lots of places (although there were guys doing plastering whilst we were there!) Our room looked like something out of the 1970s - furniture, curtains, all bathroom furniture including a shower hose with no hook on the wall (annoying when washing your hair) Not enough blankets on the bed - we were cold but the receptionist did get us another blanket from one of the empty rooms The breakfast was just croissant with tea or coffee, however the waiter was really friendly every morning.

We rented 2 rooms for 3 nights from December 30, 2006 until January 1, 2007. In the room my wife and I were assigned it smelled like a sewer or rotting garbage. The towels were very dull, dirty and dingy looking and the shower stall was so small I literally could not fit into it. The t.v. set had a 10 inch or smaller screen, and even though it was hooked up to a cable antenna most of the 10 channels it received were of very poor picture quality. When we complained about the smell the desk person gave us a can of air freshner. It helped a little. When we went to bed one of thebeds had broken springs to the point that I couldn't sleep in it. My wife traded beds with me and she made herself a sleeping bag like area out of the blankets and was able to sleep wrapped up for the 1st night. Between the smell and the bed we requested another room the next night and fortunately we were moved to another room. My kids room had roaches which they killed several. The room we were moved to had a roach crawling around in the desk drawer, little to no heat coming from the small radiator located next to the window that was blocked by the curtains so even if it came on you wouldn't feel it because the heat would all be behind the curtain. Since it never got really hot there was no need for constant air conditoning but the hotel has none. Our last night was very humid outside which made the room very stuffy so even in the winter the ability to have some a/c to help in situations like that is helpful. While I realize that we were staying in Rome during a holiday weekend there is a premium price to be paid, I strongly feel we paid a premium price for a lot less then premium sleeping quarters.

To our shock, horror and amazement a cockroach fell from a ledge in the bathroom into a bin! One of us bagged it and took it to show the receptionist who showed no alarm whatsovever! we told the receptionist that we refused to stay in the room.

After viewing rooms and pleading for the room shown on the Internet, we were finally given a room that resembled the rooms shown on the Internet. Why did they not give us this roon in the first place? Why did it take 3 hours of pleading adn viewing to get what was advertised?

Also, be aware there is a bird flying loose in the breakfast area, take your own towels or buy them in Rome and leave them there!
