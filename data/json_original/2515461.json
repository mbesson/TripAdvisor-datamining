Comfy beds and decent bed and bath linens. We had a two bedroom, two bath suite with a small living area and full, if somewhat tiny kitchen. The hotel grounds are very good; we used the pool and the spa tub which were both kept up well with pool towels and lots of comfortable chairs and tables. The hot breakfast was great with slightly different selections every day and the attendant Frank took good care of everybody, even our little kiddies! All the staff, front desk, housekeeping, facilities were friendly and professional and service was always very prompt. The hotel is walking distance to lots of restaurants, grocery stores and shopping (Marshall's, Ross) and there is also a golf course nearby. Parking is free. I have just a few complaints/suggestions: There is not wifi throughout the complex. In our room (on the ground floor) there was only one wired internet connection. We inquired about getting another cable, but learned the room had only one port, so we were unable to both work on our computers at the same time. (There is wireless in the lobby.) There were no luggage racks in either bedroom so you have to leave your bag on the floor of the closet or room or unpack if you don't want to have to squat everytime you want to get at your stuff. My bathroom had only a shower and it was *tiny* and had only a soap dish; no where to put shampoo, razor, etc. The other bathroom was better with a full tub.

The lobby is smaller than most of this type, but hey, you aren't there to sit in the lobby, right? The staff was friendly, efficient and professional, from front desk through to housekeeping. The business center is basically a computer on a shelf with a b + w printer, next to the convenience center coolers. The breakfast area/lounge was claustrophobically crowded on this holiday week, but the Russian woman who takes care of the area kept everything clear and food available. We had a one-bedroom queen bed unit. It seemed to have been recently redecorated in a very pleasing Tuscan red, greyish green, and cream color scheme, but sadly there really was no place to lay a suitcase out for a short stay. We might have been able to get a luggage rack from the desk, but made do by placing one case in the living room. Overall the bedroom was a bit tight. The mattress seemed a little soft to us; we have had wonderful sleeps at other Marriott Residence Inns. The bathroom was nicely done but we had to stop using the fan/light combination by the tub since the fan was extremely loud. The living area features a sort of fainting couch and desk, with an ottoman for extra seating. For a single long-term stay user, probably sufficient. The kitchenette is a fairly normal setup with a two-burner stove and microwave, a tiny dishwasher, and fridge. It would be nice if they also provided manual dishwashing soap so that the entire dishwasher doesn't have to be used for a few cups and glasses. The exterior space by the pool and tennis court was very pleasant and shaded, with excellent and comfortable seating, with a barbecue grille available to use. The hotel is in a shopping center across from a couple others, and just a half-block or so from the 15 freeway, so it's very conveniently located for travel and business use.

Each bedroom had its own bathroom which was really convenient! This was cheaper for us than getting 2 separate regular rooms at another hotel (comparable to to a similar safe, clean hotel, that is!) and also cheaper than staying in a 1 BR suite at any other suites properties that I researched. The room was beautifully decorated, very modern, and very clean. The kitchen almost looked as if it had never even been cooked in! Very nice full-size fridge, stove and dishwasher......the kitchen itself is a little small, as are all the rooms, but because of the layout, we did not feel crowded at all! The rest of the facility was really nice too, especially the recreation area. We enjoyed being able to eat our breakfast out on the patio under an umbrella-table (they have a really nice indoor eating area as well)......and the breakfast was very nice! Lots of variety......better than most hotel buffets I have had! Also, we were not there to take advantage, but saw that they have complimentary dinner-time meals Monday through Wednesday, and the menu hanging on our fridge looked pretty yummy, including a BBQ on Wednesdays. We only wished we could've stayed longer! They had lots of amenities for familiy activities, such as a ping-pong table, basketball/tennis court, pool & jacuzzi (pool was a nice depth for kids.....shallow on the ends and just slightly deeper in the middle). There was also a dog park, and a really nice outdoor sitting area with a pretty fountain and comfortable, cushioned chairs. Also wanted to mention that the hotel is in an excellent location.....just off the 15 freeway in a beautiful residential area.....great restaurants nearby; we walked to an Olive Garden and had a delicious dinner. We were exactly halfway between the San Diego Zoo and the Wild Animal Park (Safari Park), which is what we were on vacation to do (20 minutes from each park). Parking was safe & free, and wifi was free too (There was a hook-up cable in the room, but I was also able to pull up an open wifi connection on my smart phone).

At $ 83.00 plus taxes per night, I decided to take a chance and book a reservation for three nights (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). Location: I think that the location of the hotel is very good. For us, it was short drive (under 30 minutes) to Legoland, San Diego\u2019s Wild Animal Park and Sea World. There are several restaurants, shopping centers, grocers (Ralph, Trader Joes) and etc. that are located within a mile (several across the street; several under \u00bc mile; etc) of the hotel. There is a gas station across the street which makes it easy to fill up the rental car. Service: I have to give the hotel a good mark in regards to service. I received an e-mail from the hotel before my stay asking me if there is anything that they could do for me. When I asked for information for some local attractions and it was waiting for me when I checked us in at the hotel. Also, I sent back an e-mail requesting a room in Building 1 to 5 to avoid the highway traffic noise that has been reported in some of the reviews. Since my wife is allergic to dogs, I requested a room where no dogs were previous \u2018guests\u2019 since pets are acceptable at this hotel. We were given a room in Building 1 and we didn\u2019t smell \u2018dog\u2019 in our room. The front desk employees were friendly and smiling when dealing with them. The breakfast room \u2018hostess\u2019 was constantly busy and working hard in getting the food out. Room: As reported in the other reviews, this is an \u2018older\u2019 Residence Inn. As a Marriott Rewards Platinum Member, I have stayed at several Residence Inns and this one has the smallest room\\space. The bedroom had a queen bed instead of a king bed. Instead of a separate kitchen table with four chairs, it had a kitchen bar with two chairs. The d\u00e9cor was dated. It had the same kitchen cabinets that I had in an apartment in a brand new apartment complex that I moved into 1985. It had Formica countertops instead of fake granite\\stone countertops that I have seen in other Residence Inns. The door to our room wasn\u2019t properly framed (see picture attachments). At the top of the door, it fit pretty close to the frame. However, at the bottom of the door, there was nearly an inch gap\u2026when you lock the dead bolt lock, the gap was large enough that you could see the carpet in the hallway. Due to this gap, you could hear every guest that walked past our room. I saw other doors with this same \u2018framing\u2019 issue. TV: The TV was old (no ports to attach our digital camera or digital camcorder to review pictures and movies that we took during the day). It was small (guessing it as 25\u201d or 27\u201d). It was no flat screen. We like to review our pictures and movies. We only watch 15 minutes of TV per day to catch the news so that wasn\u2019t an overall issue for us. Bed: It was very comfortable. It had luxury bedding. Desk: The hotel\u2019s website stated that each room had an ergonomic chair at the desk. The chair at our desk was not an ergonomic chair\u2026it was an old wooden chair that I have seen at several hotels throughout North America. Hotel Guests: It seems like this hotel attracts a lot of guests on the weekends that are there to see the attractions in San Diego. It seems like most of these guests go to breakfast at the same causing a shortage of seating. There are only eight tables plus three to five tables outside. If you come early, there were seating available inside. If you come at the rush, there is a probability that you will eat back in your room, standing up, waiting for a table and etc. On the Monday morning that we were there, the breakfast room was pretty empty. The set up for the breakfast room was different on Monday compared to Saturday and Sunday. Breakfasts: Due to the large influx of guests on the weekends, they removed the waffle maker (it was there on Monday) from the breakfast room; therefore, instead of having \u2018hot\u2019 waffles, they made waffles in the back, cut them in quarters and place them on a plate\u2026they were not \u2018hot\u2019. I like my waffles to be hot to soak in the butter and syrup. They didn\u2019t serve \u2018meat\u2019 (i.e. bacon, sausage links or sausage patties) for the Saturday and Sunday breakfasts. It is my guess that this was done to save money since they had pretty have more people eating breakfasts on these days. On Monday, sausage patties were served. They ran out of food quickly on Saturday and Sunday and it took some time for the food to be replaced. It wasn\u2019t the lack of service from the breakfast room hostess\u2026just too many people eating at the same time. Value: At $ 93.43 ($83.00 room rate plus $ 10.43 in taxes), it was a very good value.

There are steam trays full of eggs and pancakes, and various pastries. The location is convenient, with two reasonably good restaurants practically in the same parking lot.

We have a very lovable 130 lb. Great Dane and had a hard time finding a hotel that would allow a dog that size. Residence Inns allow dogs and don't have a weight limit. They informed us at the time of the reservation that there would be a $150 one-time cleaning fee, but when our bill came out, they actually only charged us $100. The staff was wonderful. Very friendly and really went out of their way to accomodate us. The rooms were very clean, nothing fancy, but more than adequate. Pets do not have to be crated but they do ask that you have the pet out of the room to allow the housekeeping staff to clean, which only makes sense. We only had them come every 2-3 days and would just get fresh towels on other days if needed. Free (wired) high-speed internet is also included. There was even a fireplace that you could purchase fire logs at the front desk to burn. The kitchenette had a microwave, upright fridge, and two-burner stovetop. One great feature is that you can leave a grocery shopping list at the front desk and they will do your grocery shopping for you. There is no fee for the service and they only charge you the actual supermarket price for the items. The free breakfast was above average and included scrambled eggs, make your own Belgian waffles, cold cereals, oatmeal, granola, pastries, rice, sausages, and potatoes. The food was pretty good but the eggs and potatoes did have a bit of an artificial flavor (like cafeteria food). We didn't take advantage of it, but there are also free social hours on weekdays and free managers dinners several nights/week. The surrounding area was very safe with some (but not a lot) of grass to walk dogs. Lots of shopping options in the neighborhood. There is a lot of traffic so you had to be very careful if you went for a walk. There is a small gym in the hotel but your room also includes free access to a health club that is about 1/2 mile away. There is also a small pool, hot tub, basketball/tennis court. For anyone with pets, especially for an extended stay, the Residence Inn was wonderful. We were on the go quite a bit so didn't take advantage of the food as much as we should have but it would be a significant cost savings for families with children or on a limited budget.

I booked through arestravel.com which allowed me to pay only a deposit of $15 up front - the rest was billed to me at the end of our stay. I booked a one room suite. We arrived late on a Friday night - we stayed in Building 6 - I had read the previous review about the higher the building number the closer you are to the freeway (and the noise) and I was happy - I could definitely hear the freeway, but it wasnt enough to keep me awake at night, although I assume if you are in Bldg 10 you would definitely run into this problem. The hotel is convenient enough to the I-15 freeway (it is right off the freeway) and is in the middle of a great shopping area - you can walk to the Olive Garden, Carls Jr., Subway, Chevron, etc. and is literally a 2minute drive to the Calif.Pizza Kitchen, Chevy's, Marie Callendars, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, etc. There is also a Ralphs Supermarket and Rite Aid right around the corner...VERY convenient. I loved the location! The room itself was kept very clean by housekeeping and I found nothing that I could complain about. Also, FREE high speed internet connection in the rooms! At the main office you can use their computer in their business center if you need to print out boarding passes, admission tickets, etc. I used it to print out our Sea World tickets - they charge your room $.10 for every page you have printed. The pull out sofa bed in the room was adequate - my kids brought their own bedding for the sofa bed, which was totally my preference, there were sheets for the sofa bed and extra pillows provided. My only complaint (which had nothing to do with the hotel) was the mosquitos - they were everywhere! I was going to ask to switch rooms as I thought it was a room problem, but my husband found a mosquito swatter in the closet and we guessed that this was a San Diego problem and not a room problem. I may be wrong, but we didnt let the mosquitos ruin our vacation! The morning breakfasts were great, but take everyone else's advice and get there early as tables fill up fast. There was a party of six that came to breakfast every morning and then leisurely sat at the tables chit-chatting while people waited for tables to sit at. Nothing wrong with that but common courtesy I guess would be to continue conversation elsewhere where the seating is not so limiting --- literally maybe 6-7 tables to sit at. The breakfast buffet always had dry cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, doughnuts and pastries, toast, bagels, fruit, scrambled eggs and fried potatoes. They alternated the hot entree offerings by serving hot croissants, french toast, pancakes the first day; french toast, biscuits & gravy the second day; and sausage patties and tortillas the third day, along with a rice-cooker filled with steamed rice. There is also a waffle maker available all days, but it only makes one belgian waffle at a time.

Call ahead to see if there is any construction near by, and it wouldn't have been a problem except our building was near the freeway. If you book here, try to get a building closer to the main area. We were in building 8. They have 1 through 10 buildings and the closer to 10 the closer you are to the freeway. The FREE breakfast in the morning was very good. Cereal, oatmeal, bagels, toast, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, donuts, coffee, juices, soft drinks. The eating area is a bit small though and had to wait each morning to find a spot to eat with a family of 5.
