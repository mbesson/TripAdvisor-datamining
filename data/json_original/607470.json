You can imagine that if the room itself was small ( it was for double occupancy by the way), the bathroom was miniature. When you took a shower, you had to orchestrate your movements carefully otherwise the water might over run to the room. Besides, you hardly had room to maneuver. To think that I am a petite 5' person. Of course, I was travelling on a budget so I suppose I got what I paid for which I understand for Singapore was quite acceptable. But I still can't get over how small the room was so that when I met a Russian ( he must have been at least 6'3\" tall and a bulky build) I could not help but ask him how he managed to fit himself into the room. He replied humorously, \"with much difficulty\". On the plus side, the hotel was at least clean and breakfast passable. The service was o.k. perhaps because the front desk personnel were all Filipinos. I got the surprise of my life though when one of them, who looked like a Chinese, greeted us (my friend and I ) with a British accent. It was only when she overheard my friend and I talking in our native language that she informed us that she was a Filipino. Location of the hotel was in the \"Indian\" area of Singapore, walking distance to places of interests and shops ( if you like to walk long distances which I did ). But the hotel area had a lot of \"sidewalk places\" where one could enjoy Singaporean food, which I did. So if you are budget traveler, which I am most of the time, the hotel, was OK even if the room was a closet.

(Check-in after 3PM, check-out before 12noon) Room was clean. Bed was not soft but sleep-able. (though I didn't sleep well on the first night) Bed sheet was clean but has holes. The air-cond works too well, with some water noises and 'whooosh' sounds. Bathroom was clean. Has water heater. Room lights works. Toilet did not smell fishy. Provides electronic water boiler. Provides hair dryer. Provides 2 hangers. Flat-screen TV with workable remote controller. Free luggage room where you can put your luggage in for FREE after you checked out. Cons: Room was small, it was hard to open my medium sized luggage. Broken mirror. You might hit or gang the wall while trying to move around or changing clothes. Small, very very small toilet. (you might wet the toilet paper if you are not careful enough and once you bath, you will wet the whole toilet/bathroom/washroom) Bed was short and small, if your height is more than 5'9, then your foot will exceed the bed's end. WIFI / Internet is chargable. (refer to my photos for the fees) Breakfast is terrible. One of the workers, I don't know their names but it was two of the aunties, very rude and very insensitive and very impatient. They thought we don't know how to speak English. I don't know, maybe they have hormone imbalance or something? Even the auntie outside the Old Chang Kee selling curry puff also behave the same. The wall/room is not soundproof, you can hear people talking/walking/pushing luggage/slamming doors/taking bath/hair drying in the night or middle of night.

(max 5 nights) . The room service food was very nice, we just had a fried rice, but was lovely.The best thing about the hotel is its location. The train station is around the corner and the train system very easy to use. China town is 2 stops away. little India is down the street. Tip- go to china town first ( before little india) and wait till you get to the shops at the end before you start buying things. Most things are 3 for $10. We booked Universal studios with oneway transport from the hotel for the standard ticket price. The Sky way from sentosa is free when you are leaving. I still cant beleive how simple the train system was to use. 1 touch the screen to indicate destination. 2 pay fare( change given up to $4).3 a smart rider card is given for you to tag on and off the train. 4 at your destination, put your smart rider card back into the machine and you will get $1 refund.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood clean great location worth the money\u201d", "Author": "Stathos", "ReviewID": "UR118847051", "Content": "Recommend it on low budget.Very close everything.Pool is great for swim.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cSmall Room, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "erryfp", "ReviewID": "UR118698022", "Content": "This hotel is one branch of Fragrance Hotel chains. The location is very good, near Little India, Bugis, and Orchard area. The closest MRT station is Little India, I think, only 5 mins walk across Tekka Market. Dhoby Ghaut MRT isn't too far also. Just 10 - 15 mins strolling down south to the crossroad of Prinsep Rd and Orchard Rd. Bus stop is in the front of the hotel. Taxis are plenty too. Right beside the hotel, there's 7-Eleven store and a local foodcourt. About the hotel itself, checkin was fast. I only needed to sign a confirmation letter (as the payment was already paid before). There's only one lift in the building to serve 10-storey building. But I rather disappointed with the room. It was so small there's barely floor space to move around and put luggage. The bathroom was also very minimalist. Only a square room consisted a wash basin, a toilet, and shower mounted on the wall. When I took a bath, floor quickly became wet and it took a long time to dry up. Nice thing about the room was the comfortable bed, cool air conditioning, wall-mounted TV, and an electric water boiler. You could boil some water to refill your drinking bottle as mineral water in Singapore is so expensive. Breakfast was quite good also. The capacity of the cafe (place for having breakfast) isn't too big, so you have to queue if the tables were fully occupied. After you got seated, you could choose one of three set of menus: 1) Sunny-side eggs served with hashbrown and choice of chicken ham/turkey bacon/chicken sausages; 2) Noodle soup with same choice of meat as 1); and 3) Cereals with mlik.

For us it was pretty much just a place to sleep, bathe, have breakfast and leave our things because we were busy sight-seeing the rest of the time. There are many places of interest nearby like Little India (LOVED the 24-hour Mustafa Shopping Centre!), and MRT stations at walking distance. The room is itsy-bitsy at 3 x 3 meters and the bathroom, 1.5 x 1 meters. There was just enough space in the room for a bed, a small dresser and a chair. The telephone and TV are mounted on the wall. In the bathroom, everything is right there with the showerhead also attached to the wall so the toilet would be wet after showering, but there was strong water pressure and it didn't take long for water to heat. For such a tiny room, they still had amenities like complimentary coffee, electric teapot, shower caps and a few other items, and a body-wash dispenser in the bathroom. Despite its small size it was a comfortable-enough room, except that the walls were thin and anyone passing by outside could be heard, including wheeled luggage clicking/rolling away on the tile floor. The room was always very clean. Staff service was not consistent, some of the Front Desk staff being extremely helpful with our touristy inquiries, and others being a little bit clipped in their responses. I appreciated that the Front Desk staff informed me there was an international payphone a few steps outside the hotel where I could make calls for 1/4 the rate that it would cost if calling from inside the room. The staff at breakfast were always very nice with prompt service. Breakfast is also not amazing but it was filling for someone of my appetite, at least it wasn't just pieces of toast with jam. There was the toast, with two eggs (or you could choose noodles instead of the toast and eggs), and one of your choice of three breakfast meats (turkey ham, chicken sausage, and I forgot the other one). It was helpful that there was a tour desk (tour operator was called RMG) from 9 AM to 6 PM everyday and there were plenty of brochures in the lobby to help us maximize our sightseeing, which we needed because it was our first time in Singapore. Side note - be careful which tour packages you take. Some of them are very good value for money (we took the Sentosa afternoon tour) and others are a bit of a rip-off; we got suckered into the Night Safari, which as it turned out would have been much cheaper to go on our own AND we got left behind by the bus home even though we were at the meeting place on time.

We asked for a room with a view and we got it!. The staff at front desk were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The room was kept very clean. The swimming pool was just wonderful after coming home from a tiring day on the go!!!The breakfast isn't filling but the portion is enough to get you through to lunch. One negative comment would be the size of the breakfast room. When we had to eat early (7.15am) to be ready for an 8am departure to Malaysia, we found that seats were minded by patrons for their friends. We complained at reception and got immediate attention and seats for breakfast that morning. Overall, I would give Fragrance Hotel - Selegie a 4 out of 5. The one mark was lost due to the small room. I would stay there again and do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any couple that wants to discover Singapore.

After I did (in their business center), the front desk told me they could not confirm the booking b/c their business office was closed (6 p.m.) and asked me to pay a cash deposit or charge my MasterCard. After I refused, the front desk asked me to print out my reservation (FOR A FEE) from the computer. I also refused to pay this fee since I was not told about the office closed complication. Finally they printed out my reservation from my e-mail account. The front desk did not apologize for the inconvenience. The check in process took 30 minutes. -After check in, the front desk checked us into the wrong room w/ one bed after I specifically asked for the exact same type of room (two beds) from the night before. **The front desk did not apologize for their error.** -The following morning, after I requested a 1 p.m. check out b/c we went to sleep at 6 a.m., we were called no less than THREE times starting at 11 a.m. in the morning, advising us to check out at 12 p.m. Imagine the frustration when you are running on very little sleep and the front desk is constantly hassling you to check out before the agreed upon time (also put in writing on check in). Again, we were called THREE times in the same morning after telling the front desk we needed a late check out. Room: -The room is small, but for the price, there is no reason to complain about the size. I am curious how big the rooms are at a similarly priced hotel/chain such as Hotel 81 (adjacent to Fragrance Selegie). -Expect to be woken up by your neighbors in the morning due to thin doors and many rooms next to each other and narrow halls. Recommend ear plugs and unplugging phone for good night sleep. -Expect the sun to wake you up through the curtains. -Wi-Fi is available in the room but you must pay to use it. The business center is $1 SGD for 15 minutes. Location: -The location is in Little India. There are many excellent, affordable restaurants within walking distance, especially if you are vegetarian. This was a big plus for our stay. -It is very difficult to get a taxi outside of the hotel b/c the taxis do not want to stop at the bus stop outside of the hotel. You have to walk a few blocks away to hail a taxi. There is a reservation fee for the front desk to fetch you a taxi. -There are shopping centers within walking distance and the main subway hub is about a 5-10 minute walk away. Amenities: -Rooftop pool is a big plus. You can use this pool even AFTER you check out. The adjacent toilet has a shower so you can wash up before you catch your evening flight or what have you. -The cafe services included breakfast up to 11 a.m. This is great if you need to sleep in and still want to eat a light breakfast. -The cafe does not allow outside food which I find ridiculous. You pay a hotel for a home away from home and you should be able to eat outside of an EXTREMELY tiny room which is uncomfortable to eat in. Miscellaneous -There is no storage closet/locker for bags, although you can leave your bags in the lobby after check out which I do not recommend if you need any level of security. Conclusion -I do not recommend this hotel, check out Hotel 81 next door (or other value hotels) as a possible alternative (although I did not stay at Hotel 81). -If you MUST stay here, go to sleep with the phone unplugged and with ear plugs in and eye mask, and book your reservation at least 24 hours in advance (print out your reservation if possible).", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "wien", "Title": "\u201cSmall Room\u201d", "Author": "EdithEdith", "ReviewID": "UR65127578", "Content": "negative: very small room, toilet=shower (hence whole bath room wet after shower), we were downgraded i/o upgraded, TV was broken in our room, air condition was very loud, breakfast was very basic and not charming at all positive: swimming pool, 5 min to next subway station (Little India)", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pekanbaru, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cBad HOTEL..

We were on our way to Bali for a short holiday, and had to stay a night in Singapore, to catch an early-morning 6:20am flight out. After checking out the hotel-group's website and reading some of the reviews on Tripadvisor, we zeroed in on the Fragrance Selegie. Sure, every reviewer had mentioned the small size of the room - but I guess nothing had quite prepared us for just How small it actually is.... I mean, its TINY !!!! So... anyone reading this review, get this into your minds guys! - the room is TINY! the beds are TINY! (if you are 6feet tall and well-built, you won't fit. if you are in the habit of rolling over in your sleep, you WILL fall off - but only on one side, the other side of the bed is bang against the wall). The loo is TINIER still! There is no cupboard, only a few hooks for the clothes-hangers. There is No place to really open up your suitcase and leave it that way - you need to take out whatever you need, and then leave it upright (unless you intend to jump over it!). Overall it is spotlessly clean, the AC works well, the room has all the basic amenities in terms of TV, electric kettle, mineral water and even a chair! LOL! You may feel that such a cramped room is really not worth paying 99 Sing-dollars for... however, what you cannot find fault with is the location. This place is located just 5 minutes walk away from Little India with its myriad offerings and interests, and about 10minutes walk in the opposite direction from Orchard Rd. There is a tube-station nearby. Taxis are easily available at all times of the day and night. (We were a bit worried initially whether we would find a cab easily at 4am and thought of pre-booking a cab, but the hotel staff assured us there was no need to do that and pay the extra booking-fee). Can't really comment on any of the other amenities, or the complimentary breakfast that's part of the room-rate. We had checked in at 9pm and checked out at 4am, so skipped the breakfast. To sum up, if you are looking for a nice spacious well-located holiday hotel to laze around in, this place is not what you're looking for!... however, like us, if you are merely looking for a place to crash for one night (maybe two!) then consider this hotel for its great location.

If you put your suitcase lying down, you will take up a lot of room on the floor. You will have to step over the luggage to get around the bed. The bathroom is super tiny as well. I thought the other reviews were exaggerating when they said that you could go to the toilet and have a shower at the same time, but its true! Although the room is small, it is VERY clean and if you just want to use the hotel for sleeping, then it serves its purpose very well. The bathroom has a soap dispenser for showers, so there is no need to bring your own body soap. They also provide you with plastic sealed cups of water daily, as well as crackers, and a tissue box. The pool is nice and clean and when we used it, there weren't many other people (or anyone for that matter). The hotel charges you if you want an extra towel for swimming though. Breakfast is simple to kick start your day. We stayed there 6 nights and had complimentary breakfast there every morning. Each person gets 2 eggs (sunny side up or well done), 2 pieces of toast and jam, a hash brown, a piece of lettuce and a piece of tomato, and coffee and juice. I didn't get sick of it, but my friends did. The location is superb. It is located thin 10 minutes walk to Bugis Markets, 5 minutes walk to Little India and Little India MRT which takes you everywhere and 15 minutes walk to Orchard Rd.

They quickly obliged and that was a relief. For breakfast, we had American Breakfast for 4 days straight as our stay was for 5 days. As Asian, I guess my taste is more for Asian cuisine though I did not mind the American Breakfast. The location of the hotel is very strategic despite the tiny room we were put into. Little India is just a stone throw, Orchard Rd is just a few minutes walk form the hotel and there are plenty of food stalls and restaurants in the area in case you go hungry. For a quick bite, you can go to 7-eleven that is located next to the hotel. They have a variety of sandwiches up for grab. Going around is also easy. At the lobby, there is a travel agent desk ready to take you around to interesting places in Singapore. The service provided was good and the guides are well-trained. There is a public bus right in front of the hotel and we tried getting on that one too. It cost us a dollar each to get to the hotel from the Singapore Flyer.

The bed was basically a hard foam slab - and it has a vinyl cover over it. It was extremely uncomfortable and we had two nights of horrible sleep. The room was exceptionally noisy with the sound of water flushing around. The corridors are very noisy and the cleaners kept insisting on shouting and dragging equipment around at 10-11pm. Why so late? On the positive side, the location of the property is excellent, is very clean and tidy, the staff are very friendly and oblivious to their guests pain. The combined TV/DVD player is a nice touch - but only if you've got DVD's to play. The range of TV channels is like 5 channels, mostly in asian languages and with terrible reception. We booked on Wotif and paid SGP$171 per night for a 'superior room' which was cheaper than the rack rate. For this price, this property has no right to call itself a Hotel.

And, I have already reported it. Nobody could speak proper English at the reception, I asked for directions to the Rendevouz Hotel..I get told 3 times..'sure we can do your laundry'..oh well. I look for a bath to soak in, nothing. Ask reception where it is..and find out there is a shower right above the toilet. So, you end up removing towels or anything you dont want to get soaked. Great! And if you are a person with long legs, try sitting on the toilet sideways. helps not to squeeze your legs against the wall. Bed bugs! Galore! I am still scratching. If you smoke, you might need a mask, no ventilation, cant open the window. Three good things, you have a phone, a TV, and an air-conditioner. Space..hahahahaha! Quietness, nothing, kids running up and down the room above you or your corridor, and my most pet peeve..the breakfast service! Get cold toast and no butter..get coffee 10 minutes later..20 minutes, screaming for breakfast only to be told..oh sorry..we are busy! Thanks..but guess what? Me very hungry and want HOT food! So, bring me HOT everything RIGHT NOW!!! So, if you choose this hotel..good luck to you!

I am yet to figure out how the house keeping guys would have cleaned the room with luggage on the floor - No considerations given to families with more than 3 members and the rooms are given for them in different floors - Deposit money of $5 collected for a tiny item like a multi pin adaptor and even that the guest is expected to pay at the reception and collect the item. - No bell counter to carry your loggage. Even senior citizens are expected to lug their luggage along with them. - Complimentary tea provided is not good for your palate. - Some of the reception staff are rude and uncourteous. - No feedback form or stationery kept for the guests - TV with no international channels other than HBO Positive features - Nothing found Tips to the tourist - Even if you have no other choice, do not opt to stay in this hotel, unless you enjoy tiny rooms after paying big bucks.

I did a little research on the net before we were due to leave and only found a few reviews all saying the rooms would be small, but the rooms were tidy so I was kind of resigned to the fact that it couldnt be that bad...surely! On arrival the lobby looked quite pleasant and they had a computer room hooked up to highspeed internet for $1 for 15 minutes, which was quite reasonable. On entering our rooms we received quite a shock - the rooms are absolutely tiny. There is little room for baggage to be placed on the floor and there is no cupboards or drawers to store things, only one drawer in desk/bedside table. There is one telephone, one kettle, two packets of water (which were incredibly hard to open without a pair of scissors or sharp object) and two small biscuit or cake bars, one sachet of coffee and tea. One LCD TV with HBO which has a DVD player built into it. Two small towels are provided each day along with disposable toothbrushes and one shower cap. A liquid soap dispenser is attached to the bathroom wall. The bathroom or \"wetroom\" as I like to call it is the size of a small wardrobe or hallway closet. You can basically sit on the toilet, brush your teeth and shower at the same time! Good points: - handy location. Only a 2-3 minute walk to the nearest MRT station, Little India. And a 15 minute walk to Orchard Road. - tidy hotel, staff at reception are pleasant. - cafe is pretty average, staff are nice. - roof top swimming pool is quite nice. - rooms have air-con. Bad points: - rooms are tiny. - very noisy at night - ashtrays on each level next to each lift meant that at night smoke filled our room so had to use a towel to block the space under the door. Not very impressive! My advice: if you can afford better book elsewhere. If you have already booked, please take earplugs! The noise from the hallways is terrible so my earplugs were a saviour every single night. Apparently there are rooms in the hotel that are cheaper and do not come with windows. Be aware of this. And zip up your bags and lock them. I had an article of clothing go missing while staying in the hotel and although I am not accusing room staff of stealing, I have my suspicions.", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thailand (Via UK)", "Title": "\u201cClean, good location, very noisy and tiny room.\u201d", "Author": "Richb2004", "ReviewID": "UR5924887", "Content": "I booked this hotel at the last minute, but did get chance to read the reviews. However, it was not what I expected. First let me emphasize the size of the rooms. If you imagine a Japanese Pod room and expand it a little then you are thinking about right. The walls of the room are no more than 20 inches from the bed on two sides and on the others the bed is against the wall. The bathroom is also tiny. If you are anything other than of average size you may have problems. That is not the main fault. The worst irritant is the noise from the corridors. The corridors are very narrow and are tiled. This coupled with the fact that all residents seem to wear clogs produces a constant noise! Wheeled suitcases seemed to have amplified noise. We moved room after the first night, but there was no escape. The second room had water constantly flowing through one of the pipes in the wall. I didn't have it in me to ask for another change, as I felt a little sorry for the staff. That\u2019s the bad stuff, which was enough for me never to skimp on hotels again. The good points are the location and the cleanliness. The Little India MRT station is a two minute walk. Orchard road is a short walk too. The room, although tiny, was clean. The room also has a TV with built in DVD player and a small selection of channels including CNN and HBO movies. The room is also equipped with two towels of modest size. A kettle is also in the room with a ration of coffee etc, but no spoon or cups that I could find. The leather bound (anti-pee) mattresses added to my discomfort. Breakfast is just about adequate, consisting of a tea or coffee, orange juice, two fried eggs, leaf of lettuce, two slices of meat and a potato thingy. However the breakfast area is extremely overcrowded with a queue of people constantly waiting to be seated. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and did their best to help. I felt sorry for them as I saw two other guests asking about changing rooms, whilst I was there. So, the hotel is clean, cheap, and in a good location. If you can handle the noise and don't mind very small spaces then this is the place for you, otherwise steer clear. I was tempted to give the review one star, but after reconsidering I figured that if you are a deaf midget then this might be ideal.", "Date": "October 7, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fragrance Hotel - Selegie", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d607470-Reviews-Fragrance_Hotel_Selegie-Singapore.html", "Price": "$79 - $133*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">183 Selegie Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">188329</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "607470", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ea/45/ea45ea2edadfc9895459887bd67fc4576large.jpg"}}
