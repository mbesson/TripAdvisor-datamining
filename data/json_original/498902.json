I stayed at this hotel since it opened and I never had a problem here. The last three years I haven't been to Ocean City MD but I decided to returned and book to stay at this Hotel for seven days. The seven days i was there My room was never cleaned. I called the front desk and I was told by the Owner that the rooms were only cleaned every three days. I wasn't ever brought toilet paper, clean towels, and my room wasn't ever vacummed. My beds weren't made and sheets wheren't ever changed, YUK!!!! Everyday i had to go to the front desk and ask for Clean towels and toilet paper. The person who identified himself as the owner must live there because he works day and night at the front desk. All he knows how to do is make up excuses for his staff not cleaning. I asked if the pool was ever cleaned and i was told it is cleaned daily. REALLY!!!! I checked three times a day and it was the dirtest pool i ever seen in my life. Bugs on top of the water, sand that looks like it was poured by buckets. Dirty Dirty Dirty. Ohh and the pool out coach was a night mare with stains all over. One thing i can say is that neither me or my family would ever stay inside of this dump again!!!!!!!

So I asked if this was the manager to whom I was speaking to and to my surprised it was. I understand that sometime hotels can't make any discounts or adjustments, but just the attitude he replied to me with said to me bluntly, \"I don't care for your business\" when there's other ways to approach with a good attitude. We really were wanting to stay here, but his attitude just said to us that we wouldn't be able to count on the manager of the hotel if there was to go something wrong during our stay.

It's a very convenient location, with a bus stop right outside the door and a doughnut shop across the street. The beach is about a block away and you do not have to cross any streets between the hotel and beach. There is a lifeguard stand and a place to rent beach umbrellas right on the beach.

We got bumped from our first choice hotel and decided to take a chance on this hotel. After reading the reviews, I was hesitant, but thought we could stay anywhere for only three nights. Well, we stayed, but it was not in any way a relaxing get away! BELIEVE the reviews - it is certainly not a family hotel in any way. Each floor has a lobby area, which to me, invites people to gather. Not a bad thing, unless your room happens to be off the lobby area; which ours was. Why they would ever put a family with young children and an older person here, I cannot understand. I had to ask a group of adults to be quiet the first night (this was at MIDNIGHT). They were camped out around the lobby -literally with camp chairs set up - playing cards and drinking. They had the courtesy to leave when I complained, but they were then replaced with a group of tweens just screaming and running around. Translation: Mom and Dad didn't want them in their room so they sent them to the \"lobby.\" After asking them twice to quiet down, we had to call the front desk. They did immediately address the issue, but in the morning I noticed the lobby area was open to the downstairs front desk, plus they have cameras everyone, so they clearly knew what was going on and chose to ignore it until I called. When we asked to be moved to a quieter area we were told they were full. Also, there is a young boy working the front desk - not sure why a child that looks about 12 is working, but he was there almost the entire time we were. It seems odd to complain to a child. The older lady everyone mentioned was also there - she was ok; but no one is at all friendly. Again, to those with family, don't do it. If you're there to party, you'll be ok. Almost forgot - the indoor pool area is filthy. Full of sand, and there was actually a pigeon roosting above our heads when we laid back in the chaise.

My day began as follows: Checked in March 29, 2008. Walked into the hotel, their were two mexican women sitting in the lobby, looking funny-eyed at me. The reason why they looked at me all funny-eyed, because I was the second one coming into the hotel. I walked to the front desk surprisingly no one was there. I kindly said hello really loud.After that a man came out with his dog, a cute one I might add. He greeted me as though the hotel was jumping. After checking my credit card information, I found out that he had overcharged me, but we got that straight. I started questioning him about the pool. He stated that the pool was cool, because the heater stopped working. He stated that the Tech would be there in the morning. That was the 29th. After that he gave me my keys and I kindly took my things to my room. Once I entered the room, I started checking everything. The bathroom did not look clean to me. The freezer had food particles in it including a \"BIG FAT GRAPE\" and I don't mean pretty hot and tempting. My balcony door was open. When I walked outside for the ocean view, to my surprise I saw another hotel. In order to see the ocean view, I had to bend my neck like donkey on Shrek. The first night I decied to take my chances on swimming because I am a water-baby, of course the pool was cold and the hallway was cold. The second night was the same. I called for some coffee because it was so cold, the heat barely worked. The gentlemen told me to come and get it. He only wanted to give me one small package. I had to beg for another one. To top that off, he was drunker than the man on In Living Color. He stated he drinks whisky and some other drink. While he was talking I was pushing the elevator button. The third night I just couldn't take it any more. I had to get away from that hotel some way. So while I was driving down the road looking for a nice place to eat, God allowed me to see the Carousel Resort Hotel, which was my first choice in the beginning. I went in to look at the rooms, and they were nice, and you know I went to the pool room, and it was awesome. The pool was heated to 89 and the whirlpool was heated to 101.

There are only two slight negatives about our stay. The air conditioner was extremely noisy! It actually woke us up a few times in the middle of the night. The other negative is that there are really not many restaurants within a short walking distance. There is a take out pizza shop and a high end restaurant right across the street but really no family places nearby.

We were not greeted by anyone, but had to call out for someone to check us in. We had to pay up front for our entire stay. We were put in room 511, however the room did not even have a room # sign. The room was very plain, not at all like the pictures and empty. There was one bar of soap in the bathroom. No shampoo, no coffee, no dvd player. First night we waited 30 min. for someone to bring up extra pillows, keep in mind we only observed about four other in the hotel. On the second night 5-7 men were placed in the room right bedside ours, again keep in mind the hotel is empty. About 10:30 pm the men were on the balcony being very loud, we called down to the front desk and there was no answer. We ask the men to please quite down. We called the 800 # in the book to advertise and its an answering service speaking only in spanish. I called the phone number in phone book and still no answer. At midnight the men were still being very loud, sounding like they were right in our room, my friends and I got dressed and walked to the front desk after no response by phone. The front desk was empty and the front door unlocked. There was a sign taped to the front dest \"Lobby will reopen at 7:00am please call # for service.\" Phone at desk did not work so we went to our room and called. A man answered and said he could be there in five min. to ask them to quite down. I demanded he come now and refund our money, we were leaving due to lack of security, he hung up the phone on me and never showed up. At 7:00am we were ready to leave and at front desk.

To get service, the child needed to call out to \"grandma\" to come up front to attend to the guest at the front desk. We then had to \"fight\" with the bathroom lights...we were told that the lights needed time to warm up, which meant that if we were in a hurry...forget it. In an attempt to locate an iron, we were told that the hotel did not have irons (not one single iron). I couldn't believe that in the USA, in this day and age, we had to deal with such issues. The bed was very uncomfortable, and overall, the room furniture was a \"mess\". To top it off, the hotel's management onsite (which I believe consisted of \"grandma\" and another female) was very rude. Be fully aware that the payment policy for this hotel is unlike that of a \"regular\" hotel. Once you check in, you will be charged entirely for the nights that you've reserved, regardless of whether or not you stay at the \"hotel\". In other words, if you hate the hotel after checking in and wanted to leave, and you had planned on staying there for 5 nights, you WILL be charged for the 5 nights (no exceptions). Also, the advertisement for the hotel mentions a kitchenette suite. Well, look for a microwave and refridgerator located right at the entrance to the room, which make the room very cramped.

Sure enough, when we walked in our room, they were doubles. We asked the front desk about it and were told they are queens. We then asked about switching to a king, and of course they didn't have any. No one seemed to get, or care, that had they not falsely advertised their business, we would have stayed elsewhere. They already had our money, what incentive did they have to be nice? We got very sunburnt Friday and Saturday morning, so Sat afternoon, we returned to the room for a nap around 2:30. The room was still not cleaned, which was no big deal - we'd just get towels later. At 2:45, housekeeping knocked on the door, and I told the one girl we didn't need any service today. 2 minutes later, another housekeeper comes, banging on the door like she was gonna break it down. When I opened it up, she looks at me with an attitude saying \"We HAVE to clean the room\". I told her \"thank you but no thank you\" and she simply would not accept my answer. So much for \"hospitality\"! Check out time is 11:00. On our day of checkout, we were 95% packed by 11:00. At 11:05, housekeeping was knocking on the door. I told them 5 more minutes and we'll be gone. No lie...at 11:07, there was a call from the front desk \"kindly reminding\" us about the 11:00 check out policy, and failure to comply would result in additional charges. This hospitality is amazing!! I don't know where the hell they bought their sheets for these \"queen\" beds, but they NEVER stayed on.

I made reservations only 4 days in advance and spoke to young man on the phone (call was made direct to hotel, not a booking agency) and told him we were to arrive on Thursday evening and stay Friday, Saturday, Sunday nights, to check out 4 pm on Monday. I asked several times if they would allow a late check-out, 4 pm, on Monday, Labor Day, and that if there was an additional fee that I would have no problem paying the fee. And several times, this young man (sounded early 20s) said it was no problem for a 4 pm check-out, that most of their customers would be checking-out Monday morning Labor Day and the Hotel was not booked full for the rest of week, meaning they wouldn't need our room. I asked that me reservation be noted for a Monday late check-out and the young man confirmed it was noted in my reservation. Because they agreed to a Monday, 4 pm check-out is the only reason I reserved with Bonita Beach Upon arrival, a man in his late 50s, checked us in and from the way he presented himself, I took him to be the husband of a husband/wife/kids family ownership of Bonita Beach (his wife was there too and from their conversations, it was apparent they owned Bonita Beach. Oh, also upon arrival, this owner man saw me at the front desk waiting for service to be checked- in and he remained in a back room involved in a personal phone call for about 15 mins., all the while the wife was there too in the back room and did not acknowledge us or offer to assist us in checking in.) How rude. Anyway, upon finally checking in, I reminded the owner that I reserved a late check out on Monday and that I would pay any additional reasonable fee for this accommodation. He said he was not aware of this but did not indicate it would be a problem. I asked that he put that note on my file so that all staff would be aware of this. He said, \"okay, fine\". Labor Day Monday, morning, I go to front lobby and the wife is working the desk. She said checkout is 11:00 am. I reminded her of that upon making the reservation the young man informed me that a late check-out was okay because they were not 100% booked for the balance of the week, AND I further reminded her that upon check-in her husband did not indicate a problem with the late check out and he agreed to note my reservation and I again stated that I would pay a fee for the late checkout. We haggled for a solid 20 minutes all the while she kept stating, \"we do not have a late check out\", and all the while I'm reiterating that the only reason I chose to stay at Bonita Beach was that I was reassured several times during the reservation process via telephone direct to the hotel, and, at check-in that a late check-out would be no problem AND that I was amenible to any reasonable fee for a late check out. Then out of the blue, after 20 minutes of haggling/disputing/arguing, she says, \"well, we will have to charge you a fee if you want to stay until 4 pm\". I nearly lost it at that point. I agreed to the $50 additional cost and the kids got another afternoon on the beach. It really irked me to no end how I was treated by staff while my children watched and waited patiently. I will not return to this hotel until it is owned by someone else more amenible to customer service. BTW, Bonita Beach has their own web site and on their web site the lobby is depicted as this spacious, huge, wonderfully big lobby. And upon entering their lobby for the first time, I thought I was in the wrong hotel as the front lobby is uncomfortably small and if you have a luggage trolly full and a few people in the lobby, you will be very crammed to the point the luggage trolly becomes a major feat in order to negotiate to the elevators AND if someone is exiting the elevators with a luggage trolley while you're waiting to board, you're both in big trouble. One last note, I did have the names of everyone I spoke to: the reservation's person and the check-in man and upon haggling with the front desk woman Monday morning, I gave her the names of the persons who agreed to the late check-out and she remained totally unaffected.", "Date": "May 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cSeptember Beach Getaway at the Bonita\u201d", "Author": "greenteanj", "ReviewID": "UR3928949", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Bonita Beach for our vacation in September.

I would definately reccomend this hotel to anyone who likes to stay in Ocean City Maryland.", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cPlan to stay here again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3812598", "Content": "with reading all of the reviews for this hotel and many others, i couldnt make up my mind. so, i chose this one, unknowning what was awaiting us. i was actually pleasantly surprised. **Good points** the room is spacious and the view from the balcony was great. on the right, the bay, an on the left, the ocean! we spent a lot of time sitting on the balcony and watching the city life. it is in the middle of a lot of restaurant areas and shopping spots (81st). **Not so good points** we had to drive a way to get to the boardwalk, but figured that much from any hotel. you can actually ride the bus all day for only 2 dollars and there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel. the air conditioner is noisy (as someone else had mentioned) but if you're in the right company you wont even notice it! =) the restaruants we went to were great. for breakfast we went to the bayside skillet (twice), and the little house of pancakes. we also loved billy's sub shop, ledo's pizza, bonfire (a little pricey, but worth it), panda china buffet and rita's for dessert. all of these places were great and i highly recommend them!", "Date": "August 28, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bonita Beach Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g41298-d498902-Reviews-Bonita_Beach_Hotel-Ocean_City_Maryland.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">8100 Coastal Highway</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Ocean City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MD</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">21842</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "498902", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ac/e2/ace2093b2cb54b259f06a24f5ed24daa1large.jpg"}}
