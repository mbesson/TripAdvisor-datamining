The staff is indeed friendly, and since we don't expect or ask for much in the way of \"service,\" the opening of doors and a chorus of \"good mornings\" was about the extent of it. We did use the quite good bikes one day, and the simple reservations for them was handled quickly and easily. A personal perspective is that I can't imagine spending $17 per person for breakfast, but I noted more than a few guests did, and the breakfast room and business center are very nice, as are the terraces with the pool and several outdoor sitting areas. There are a multitude of cafes and hole-in-the-wall coffee shops within 3 minutes walk, and the grocery store on the corner (same building really) is plenty nice, too. As other reviewers do mention and as we experienced over the 5 nights, the street-front rooms can be noisy, especially if you want a little fresh air, so if that matters to you and you have the option, definitely take the rooms on the terrace side. The traffic on that street does taper off pretty well overnite, then starts picking up again around 5-6 am, so unless you want to sleep in, it's not too bad. The neighborhood is on the fringes of the serious downtown (5-10 minute walk) and the trendy warehouse district (Yaletown) is 5 minutes as well.

A fridge was provided too, which was great for storing milk for our daughter. We took breakfast in the hotel as the buffet was good value at $17.50 for all you wanted. The choice of foods was good and of high quality in my opinion. We didn't use the leisure facilities but I had a quick look at them and they seemed to be of high quality. The Italian restaurant attached to the hotel was very good on the night we ate there and we got a 15% discount as we were hotel guests. The location of the hotel was very good, with most down-town sights within walking or short taxi ride distance. We were able to walk to Chinatown in 15 minutes or so, to the boats for Granville island in under 20 minutes and to the main down-town shopping malls in less than 10 minutes.

It\u2019s true it was nearly 2:00 a.m. and we were the last guests of the night, but still. Awesome staff at this hotel. Awesome! In town for a full week to attend a large conference, we elected to stay in this sweet boutique hotel rather than one of the big impersonal chains surrounding the convention center, and we made a brilliant choice. The walk to meetings was easy, and L\u2019Hemitage was divine. We chose the solarium room because of the full kitchen and washer and dryer. Updated and fitted with Bosch appliances, the kitchen was a welcome oasis after a long day. Wine glasses, espresso machine, creamer in the fridge, linen napkins in the drawer, and a gas-stove top. The IGA on the corner of Richards and Robson was well stocked with all the gourmet items we could want to snack on, and the liquor store just around the block had a fabulous selection. We had everything we might possibly need in our room, including the proverbial chocolates on the pillow each night. The bed was an absolute cloud. Even though our sixth-floor room was on the street, and during this particular stay major construction of a large tower was occurring across the way, little noise entered the room. Plenty of closets, a deep bathtub, terry robes, slippers, the solarium, an extra meditation room, and a gas fireplace are some of the appreciated amenities in the room (#603). Each day, I visited the outdoor lap pool and relished the warm salt-water and arching spray. The hot tub was well maintained and so was the steam room in the woman\u2019s restroom. The fitness center is small but again had everything I wanted. Breakfast in L\u2019Orangerie was worth the $17 charge, especially the salmon, croissants, terrific coffee, and fresh fruit. Every day, I intended to borrow one of the hotel\u2019s free bicycles and ride along the seawall walk and down around Stanley Park, but I never got to it! So much to see and do in this beautiful city, and the hotel\u2019s location is close to it all. All in all, L\u2019Hermitage is a Vancouver treasure.

After doing some online research on Vancouver hotels, I was going to book through CAA, but then discovered the \"Trip Advisor Travellers Choice Award Pkg\" on the hotel website which seemed to be a better deal as it included breakfast, valet parking and 15% off in the the hotel restaurant. In hindsite I would have paid the same, as Valet parking is already complimentary to rooms with 2 guests (this according to the front desk staff when I asked them to explain the discount), and the restaurant was closed so couldn't take advantage of the 15%discount. So, the deal, isn't really a deal, but the price is still good for a downtown Vancouver hotel. The valet parking is the way to go, as the car is put in a secured parkade and you can walk pretty much anywhere you want to go. We booked the Boutique Room with the Fireplace. It faced the street so we didn't have much to look at (parkade), but didn't have a problem with noise as reported by some previous reviewers. I would imagine once construction gets underway across the street on the new Telus facility, this will become more of an issue. I would have preferred a room on the pool/garden side but was told there are no Boutique rooms on that side. I think that is the only way we would have used a balcony had we had one. The room itself was nicely appointed. Nice linens and comfortable bed. We did actually use the fireplace even though it was April! The staff in general were very pleasant and requests for extra wine glasses and pods for the Nespresso machine were handled very promptly. The large ensuite was nice, especially with 2 people getting ready at the same time. We didn't realize there would be a little fridge in the room, which was a nice bonus. The wood furniture was a little dusty, which didn't give me the warm fuzzies. The breakfast room was very nice, and the buffet had a nice variety, but the kitchen seemed to have a few issues keeping up with the supply the hot items, even though the room wasn't that busy. It was appreciated that the breakfast was available until 11:30am. Serving staff in the breakfast room were pleasant and attentive. Overall, although it met my expectations, it didn't exceed them.

Breakfast. Spacious room. Quiet. CON: Internet didn't work. Found some hair on the bed when we arrived. This is not a traditional hotel. It is a shared building with residential units. Still, it was real quiet. I felt safe and overall enjoyed my stay there. When we arrived, there was no one at the Valet. After 5 minutes, we went inside - bad first impression - but they sent someone right out. The check in was fast and staffs were friendly and super helpful. We stayed in a spacious 1 bdrm w/ no kitchen. Didn't use the tub, but the shower head can use better water pressure. We found multiple hair strains on the bed though ... gross! We stayed Sunday night so the restaurant was closed. We went shopping and asked the front desk on our way out for an extra rope in our room. When we returned, the rope was hung inside the closet along with the rest, but no extra sandal. So one of us walked bare-foot to the hot tub. The turn down service was lovely: they folded out the sofa bed , turned on the fireplace, and left out chocolates. It was relaxing to come back to that after shopping on Robson St (which is located around the corner). Hot tub was great. The pool was not deep and is narrow, but we were alone, so it wasn't an issue. There were some kids from couple of floors up that was whistling and screaming at us, so that was kind of annoying. I wish we could order some drink at the hot tub, though. On our way back from dinner at almost midnight, one of us stopped at the concierge desk and chatted for a while (his name starts with a C ...?) and he gave some cool local advice about how to order alcohol the Canadian way :D Breakfast was SUPER SUPER yummy and fresh. Totally worth $17.50/person even if I had to pay -- so go eat there!!! Our main compliant was that the free wireless internet didn't really work. We all have different cells, plus an iPad, and none of us could connect. We mentioned this at check out and were told the service was down last night. The gentlemen didn't say sorry or anything .. just kind of moved on to checking us out.

We opted for the latter on the basis that we would most likely need a siesta later that day to catch up on the sleep we had lost. He also deducted $30 a night off our rate and arranged for a bottle of wine to be sent to the room. This all seemed fine, but we were a bit disappointed when we got to the room. It was actually much smaller than our first room and it was missing both a fireplace and a similar seating area (just had a table and chair). It was also next to the pool and ironically we managed to get awakened by kids playing there! We also had to endure groups in nearby rooms banging on each others door and chatting outside our room (I suspect these cheaper rooms lent themselves to cheap group or family bookings).

I knew to expect the construction because there was a sign when I checked in. The construction was supposed to begin at 7:30, but I was woken up by noise before that. I mentioned that to the front desk in the morning as I was borrowing some umbrellas for the day. I wasn't super upset about it, and I didn't make a fuss or anything, but the manager bent over backward to make up for the inconvenience. He gave us a discount and breakfast vouchers. He went above and beyond, especially since the construction was not under his control in any way. Breakfast was wonderful, and a table was waiting for us when we went down that morning. The concierge was also wonderful. He gave us several tips on where to go to eat and when we told him we were going to the aquarium, he gave us coupons. He was also very helpful the next day before we left for Whistler. He gave us coupons to use at the Capilano suspension bridge and in Whistler.

The decor and ambience are classically elegant. The rooms are extremely comfortable and luxurious with a stunning and well equipped kitchen area and in suite laundry. Valet parking was very handy and it was an easy hotel to find when driving. I almost would give a 5 rating but there were a few things I look for that were not quite perfect. The floor of one of the kitchens wasn't entirely clean (old raisin or something trodden on),the bathrooms felt a little cramped with limited shelf space, some of the linen was a little worn, and there is no view. We looked onto Richards St, which made the rooms a little dark. Admittedly it was cloudy and raining throughout our stay which would have exaggerated the dark, so that may not usually be an issue. Please bear in mind these are very minor considerations, just enough that I have gone for a 4 over 5 rating. The lounge, kitchen area are a great asset and make the suites a wonderfully comfortable base from which to go out and explore Vancouver.

The room was modern, clean and spacious. The bathroom was huge and very swanky. Bed was heavenly. There was even a good size balcony. Only room disappointment was that the fireplace seemed like it was more for show and didn\u2019t really have the ambience/warmth we were expecting. So don\u2019t feel like you have to splurge for the fireplace, I didn\u2019t think it was worth it. The pool and hot tub on the roof are FABULOUS (and romantic!), definitely a huge bonus and one of the reasons we initially chose to stay at L\u2019Hermitage. During the early part of our stay, the valet damaged our car (apparently we were only the 2nd guests this had ever happened to, lucky us I guess!). What could have potentially ruined our entire stay and been handled in a thousand wrong ways, was in fact handled the one right way, beyond what we could have imagined. We were so impressed by the customer service and I only wish other hotels could take note. I need to mention Glenn and Jean-Michele, who were so prompt and sincere in following up with us and making sure everything was taken care of \u2013 your kindness and generosity did not go unnoticed!! And thanks also to Raymond, a fabulous concierge \u2013 the hotel is very lucky to have you! Despite the hiccup, we would not hesitate for a second to return to L\u2019Hermitage.

There are equally excellent luxury hotels in Vancouver, such as the Shanghai. But what is nice about L'Hermitage is that the service is a little more personable because of its size. We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay. It might not seem that significant, but I was impressed that the hotel designed its suites with everyone in mind, and I mean those with disabilities. All doors, including the bathroom, were wide enough for wheel chairs, and the bathroom with ample space for wheel chairs to move around. That means to me that all guests are well consider and accommodated for. The other thing I found was there was the service was a bit more personable. When I had booked our stay I ordered a few things for our room. After registering, when we arrived at our room a staff member was there waiting to bring our requests in, and politely asked for permission to place them in our room. Nice touch. L'Hermitage is in a great location as well, close to restaurants, theatres, Roger's Arena, and BC Place. One very, very, minor point I would advise the hotel about for the smaller boutique rooms is about the kettle you provide for boiling water, such as for tea. In the boutique rooms, at least, you need to find a plug in. There was none obvious on the furniture piece with the fridge and T.V. We had to use another outlet with the kettle on the floor.

There was a sizeable dining table, and an adjacent kitchen, with a 4 hob cooker, a microwave, dishwasher and possibly the largest refridgerator I have ever seen. The bed room was also large, with an exit on a balcony, and with a massive walk in wardrobe. Both the bedroom and living room had flat screen TVs - I could only get the one in the living room to work, but there was a massive choice of channels. The bathroom was surprising small - but the tub was very deep so a good soak could be enjoyed, There was no seperate shower - you had to stand in the tub to shower - but the quality of towels and amenties was excellent. My gripe with the bathroom was the size - the room was small, and there was no storage space for toiletries, razors etc. WiFi was available across the property and was free of charge. Location is good - 2 blocks from the Skytrain, Gastown 4 blocks, and half a block from Robson Street. The only gripe I had was breakfast, which cost C$17.50 plus tax. This is ALOT of money and I would have expected a top notch buffet for that money. What there was available was good - excellent scrambled egg, but for me, it simply not value for money. I had breakfast each day, largely to catch up with my colleagues ahead of the days activities, but if I had been on my own, I'd have been in White Spot around the corner! 4 blobs as a rating seems harsh for such an excellent - but for the price paid I needed more space in the bathroom, a working TV in the bedroom, and a more sensible price for breakfast. Otherwise - excellent.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cThe service, the service, the service!\u201d", "Author": "Nicole F", "ReviewID": "UR123715720", "Content": "We have just returned home from a 3 week family trip to the US and Canada.

The lounge area on the 5th floor is great, and the breakfast served at L' Orangerie is well-done for a small buffet. I could go on and on...I just didn't find any flaws with the hotel. But above all, it's the service that really makes L'Hermitage shine. Everyone is incredibly attentive...for lack of a better way of saying it, everyone is just really well-trained. They anticipated every need before I even had to ask. If I was near the elevator and any staff member was nearby, they would immediately swipe in their card for me so I didn't have to look for mine; at L'Orangerie, they brought extra napkins when they saw that I had a baby with me; the concierge reminded us to make reservations for dinner since we were there on a Friday night during Dine Out Vancouver, and he thought it would be hard for us to find a table with a group of our size (7). Speaking of the concierge, we asked so much of the concierges that we thought they would ask us to leave and never come back! But they were always gracious with every request.

They also all appear genuine, as in not overly friendly in a fake kind of way that sometimes make me uncomfortable. - Outdoor heated salt water pool. Long and narrow, 3-feet to 4.5-feet in depth. - Outdoor Jacuzzi. - Fitness center looked nice. It had two treadmills, two elliptical trainers, and some weights. We didn't use it but everything looked clean and new. - Pet-friendly. - Hippo, the friendly and cute French Bulldog that works during the day in the lobby. Cons (very minor): - \"Going green\", meaning missing some basic toiletries like toothbrush, which none of the three hotels in which we stayed had them by default. - Had to request a toothbrush three times. - The bathroom facet, though beautifully designed, created a thin wide stream of water that kept splashing towards my body when washing my hands. - Shower water pressure could have been stronger.

The room was surprisingly large - particularly the bathroom with separate shower and deep tub - great quality furnishings, and nice touches like Nespresso coffee and a kettle for making tea. I'd describe the king-sized bed as one of the most comfortable I've slept in, better than big name five star hotels like Westin, Hyatt, Intercontinental and Sofitel. Nearby you'll find great food for dine-in or take-out and the Marketplace IGA. I recommend eating at Japadog and Guu nearby, Cafe Medina a bit further afield for brunch, lunch or coffee, or Pourhouse for smarter dining and drinks. My only criticism of L'Hermitage is that the air-conditioning was almost the noisiest I've encountered. As the room (653) had a opening window, I mostly kept the A/C off. The Wifi was slow and patchy, with repeated requests to login each day. The gym is small and suitable for those who like the idea of working out in a hotel gym, rather than fitness training.

(If we'd opened the windows, that probably would have solved our problem). The fan/vent in the living room was surprisingly noisy, and what little noise there was in the hallway was a bit too easy to hear. The coffee from the in-room espresso machine was yummy. We brought our small dog with us, and he was made to feel very at home by the staff. The hotel has a no-dogs-left-unattended-in-room policy, so we made use of the services of nearby WOOFection dog-sitting, who did a great job of looking after him while we were out for 5 hours in the evening. I would not leave this particular dog alone in a room even if it were an option (he's a barking risk - too much danger of him disturbing other guests), but our previous dog was a fantastic traveler and I prefer to have the option of leaving a good dog in a room.

We were on the 7th floor overlooking the pool area. There was a small balcony that was just off of the living area. The step up to access it was quite high though, it almost felt like climbing out the window. It would be a little difficult for someone with any mobility issues. But that could be easily fixed, with a small wooden step perhaps, (just in case mgmt is reading this) However, once out there it was wonderful. It was a quiet oasis from the city bustle. Loved the large soaking tub. Such a nice change from the usual, barely adequate hotel tubs. The location is very central. Only about 5 blocks from the harbor.

The adjoining restaurant, Q4 was exquisite as well. My wife and I made two trips, once for dinner and the other for drinks and dessert. Dinner was very gourmet and mirrored the bravado of the hotel. Drinks and dessert at the bar was of the same caliber. Our experience of the restaurant was very solid. Finally, the surrounding area gave us little time to spend in our room.

Street in front was under construction and we could not drive to the door of the hotel and the bell staff had to unload our suitcases in the middle of the street, we had to walk through construction and rain to the front door, (we did not have unbrellas and the bell staff did not provide them) and when we walked out the door to go to the ballet, it was a noisy filthy wet construction site. Construction was not their fault, but there was no acknowledgement on anyone's part that this was awful for guests. Hotel dreadfully short staffed with almost no help anywhere. The concierce recommended a restaurant for lunch which turned out to be a 45-minute walk, was a tourist trap with huge busloads of tourists, and mediocre and expensive food.. The waiter asked us who recommended the restaurant, we told him, and he grinned. I suspect the concierge gets some kind of a kick-back. The hotel bar was closed the whole time we were there. The front desk sent us to their breakfast/lounge area on the 5th floor to wait because our room was not ready when we arrived and said they would send coffee up. The area was dark, no lights but the gas fireplace, no staff, no food, no coffee. Very grim. Our room was large, but had old and stained upholstery on the furniture and worn towels.

The service is outstanding and attention to detail second to none every positive you read about this hotel is spot on. The staff makes this place and were always professional, helpful and polite and the concierge Raymond was brilliant. Hotel Facilities- The Hotel itself is in a great location downtown and close to everything, I actually damaged my passport and needed regular trips to the consulate and this would not have been possible if I had stayed further out. Close to Steve Nash Gym and Robson shops cafe etc location was just great!!! The attraction for me booking this place was the rating and the 'boutique style' which I am becoming more accustomed to now as the service is better than the larger resort chains and this place oozed quality service. I actually felt at times that I was being over serviced if that makes sense and that the staff was trying too hard. This is no fault of the Hotel but highlights the attention to detail the guests are given in a smaller boutique style hotel. The rooms are spacious and very well maintained; I booked a Boutique Solarium room and was upgraded to the signature suite at no cost. The room itself was large and well equipped with full kitchenette and washer dryer etc and large bathroom. Soap products were of a very high quality and these are the types of details I note. The sun room was awesome and was used regularly for an office to check work emails etc. Beds were comfortable and had awesome pillows again an important element to any hotel stay. IPhone docking station on the bedside drawers!! (Another simple but very thoughtful touch) Bathroom was large with twin shower heads and a bath. Kitchen was a great addition and fridge had ice maker and there was an expresso machine also. Internet was complimentary Dining - Q4 Restaurant downstairs was open every night and served quality Italian fare. I ate there twice and could not fault the meals at all. Room service was quick and served a varied menu, zero complaints at all with the food at this Hotel. Hotel buffet breakfast was cheap at only $17.50 and served a combination of hot and cold food. Recreation facilities - Very good, outside pool I did not use due to the average weather when I was there, did not use the spa either so cannot comment on either of these. The hotel gym was simple but basic with 1 'Multi Station' gym and some free weights and cardio machines. I did not use this but instead used the Steve Nash gym one block away. (5 mins walk) Transport/Parking - The Hotel has free push bikes fir use and undercover valet is available but I am not sure of the price as I did not use it. The place is so central you do not really need transport. All in all an enjoyable stay and will definitely stay here again when next in Vancouver.

We stayed in a solarium room with a king bed and loved it so much I hated to leave for our next destination Seattle and our stay at a Westin there (read Westin towers review). What makes this place so great? The over top accommodating staff that you have to be a celeb to get in LA but is just how they do things here. And if you haven't been to Vancouver yet its clean, green and the people are friendly although it has the big city issues all big cities have like; pan handlers, drug addicts that ask for food or change on Robson Street where people of all types walk around at night. Things to do while visiting: Stanley Park: is a beautiful green park with wonderful views of the harbor that you can bike, drive or walk around and it would be perfect for a picnic too! It's my new favorite park! Capilano Suspension Bridge: fun walk across a long suspension bridge and several other smaller suspension bridges but pricey at about 35.00 each! Take your triple A card for a discount and yes, they have Triple A in Canada but its called something slightly different. The Farmers Market: there's an area on Vancouver Island where there is an ongoing, small farmers market that also incorporates spaces for other artisans showing & selling they're works. You can find gourmet cheeses and breads and lots of lovely things to buy & take back to your gourmet kitchen at L'Hermitage including some lovely flowers for your room! Drive to Whistler: I like to drive around, so we kept a car while in Vancouver but you could do without. So, when our seaplane to Victoria was grounded for fog in the am we drove to Whistler instead which is a modern and well planned out ski area that was a fun little day trip after a 2 + hour drive, which gave us some lovely views along the way. Victoria Island: fly over on a sea plane as we did and have a new adventure + save yourself the long ferry lines and time it takes to get there. Keep in mind the planes are prop, smaller and rock while docked before taking off in the harbor. So if you are claustrophobic and get seasick easily, take the ferry instead! Bonus, there's a lovely little park and walking area very near the seaplane docks if you'd like a nice walk after or before your flight! Buchart's Gardens in Victoria: lovely, but small in size as far as I'm concerned and I was underwhelmed but we enjoyed it. We got a packaged deal through our hotel and walked to the bus that took us to the gardens which were around 30 minutes from downtown Victoria. Whale and killer whale watching in Victoria: a great way to see more than just parts of island is to get on a small plane (which we did) or out on the water. So, we enjoyed doing this although we didn't see any whales killer or otherwise and only sea lions and some dolphins. I have to add that it was very surprising that our tour company was so apologetic and kind for of our not getting to see the whales, that they offered to let us come back again for free. Only in Canada have I even been offered anything like that! Canada your manners rock! All in all we had a lovely time & I know you'll enjoy your trip to Canada too:)", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLoved our stay\u201d", "Author": "JetsDad", "ReviewID": "UR118117380", "Content": "This hotel is wonderful; I would highly recommend a stay here.

The \"fireplace\" in the room was nothing more than a dancing light, no real flames or romance with this feature. We stayed in the Loden Hotel last year but feel the L\"Hermitage was better simply for room size and a place to relax in the Cosmo but cozy lounge called L'ORANGERIE. Business centre\u2019s in hotels are important for us and they again scored well with this upstairs modern centre however the wi fi in the room was a BUST- as it kept losing bars or signals and simply could not use it.

This place was perfect! We stayed in Room 704, pool view room, very quiet. I can't sleep with city noise so normally need fans and white noise, but it was remarkably quiet. We stayed in a 1 bedroom signature suite. The bedroom was closed off from the main room consisting of a couch, chair, kitchen with better appliances than most peoples' kitchens, a cute little Nespresso maker (delicious little cappuccinos every morning, if I didn't have a Keurig, I'd buy one of these...well, I want both). The bathrooms were clean and I actually walked in on a maid at one point CLEANING the toilet very thoroughly. This was just surprising to me since you see so many stories about how dirty hotel rooms are and that the maids just make it look surface clean. Anyway- that was a biggie for me:) My husband and I tried to make it back before 10 every night so we could get in the hot tub. It was very hot but awesome - and since the hotel is small, it was always just us or maybe another couple with us. We actually went to a larger fancy hotel just to get massages and they shared their locker room with the hotel guests and it was pretty nasty and chaotic in there. I was so glad we picked L'Hermitage. I picked it based on other Trip Advisor reviews and luckily, it was right on for us. Now, the royalty comments I kept reading about - that's a little extreme, but they were courteous and we had great service if we ever needed anything - exactly how I'd act if I knew someone might turn around and write a review about the experience for the whole world to see. The location was such a nice central spot. If we had realized, we'd have taken the sky train the whole time rather than taxis or that hop on/hop off tourist bus. The sky train was WAY better, we took it back from the airport and should've used that much more often. L'Hermitage is small enough that you have to have the address for taxi drivers, or just say Richards and Robson. Rent a car one day and drive to Whistler in the morning and go Ziplining with Ziptrek- we're so glad we did that - wonderful company as well. I would also recommend biking through Stanley Park - L'Hermitage is nice enough to let you use a couple for free for 4 hours, but we were too scared we'd kill ourselves riding in the streets to get there- so we rented bikes and had a nice lunch at Tea House. Spent a lot more money on bikes that way but it was worth it! Anyway, fantastic hotel, wonderful city - you have the city, mountains and ocean all wrapped up in one.

We arrived early and had requested a room with a balcony online before our visit, and it was ready for us with a smile. From check in to check out, we could not have been happier with this hotel. The desk staff was polite and helpful with any request. Our king boutique room was on the fifth floor - room 553. It was alongside the pool...only downside for some folks would be children having fun in the saltwater lap pool, but not a problem at all for us. The hot tub alongside the pool is a must at night - felt wonderful with the cool rain coming down. The steam room was clean and very user friendly. We did not use the fitness room, but it looked very clean and had whatever one would want to stay fit while on vacation. The patio is small, but it works well and is private enough fro drinks and light meals. Shower is nice, did not use tub although it could have been a nice place to soak ... toilet separate from bath area. Bed is firmer than what I am used to, but comfortable nonetheless...my wife loved it. The room had a refrigerator which was a nice place to store beverages or snacks as well as chilled beer and wine glasses, which were replenished daily by staff. We did not eat breakfast there, but there are many less expensive options blocks away. Room had espresso coffee maker and a Cuisinart hot pot in room for herbal and regular teas, but there are many coffee options nearby. The room had an IPod connection as well as free WIFi connection if you want to use it. Nice TV with more than adequate channels. Baths have soft water and very nice toiletries. We felt the hotel was in a safe area - didn't feel afraid to walk at night. We were greeted every time we walked in the door and needed our room cards to access the elevator or anything in the hotel, which made us, feel safe as well. The room had an in-room safe too. We usually don't eat hotel food, but found dinner to be most excellent...we ate there twice even without the discounts that will be mentioned next. We took advantage of a 15% discount on dinner if you stay at the hotel, plus they have a card in their literature that gives you a free dessert for lunch or dinner. We found their food some of the best for Italian...we enjoyed the beef carpaccio twice and the penne amatriciana twice (which was fantastic) and mushroom ravioli pasta, and a great rib steak special. The wine selections were very good - beer selections were limited local and international brands but very good. The local Stanley Park beer was very good. Staff was wonderful and accommodating...very good service. We used their bikes with helmets twice. - a good idea to reserve in advance for up to four hours. They will give you water for the road. We returned after dinner to have our radio playing, dim lights on, and chocolates on the bed. We would like to extend a thank you to Sean who took good care of us, and is a very genuine, personable guy. We told him we were going to a certain restaurant, and when we got there they had a free appetizer for us...impeccable customer service; staff genuine and not sterile.

Second, their breakfast buffet that you have to pay about $20 a person should not include powdered eggs, hashrowns from a box, and extremely ripe fruit. The Hampton Inn provides a much more excellent breakfast and for free - I'm sorry but for $20 a person I shouldn't have to toast my waffle, I should get to put the raw batter into a waffle iron and cook it.

Comfortable, free wi-fi, good coffee maker and (much to my other halfs delight) free slippers. She also enjoyed the pool though found the 8 or so water fountain jets along the side a bit off-putting if trying to put in a serious lap swim. They look nice but dont actually help swimmers. Breakfast was really good. Due to being 8 hours ahead body clock wise we went early and the scrambled eggs are delicious. Breakfast staff very attentive (and I thought very cute but dont tell my other half) and efficient. It was never a mad scramble to get seated, very very relaxed as it should be. Though they do need better toasters but we found that across Canada toasters just dont cut it there. Maybe its the 110v power or something but properly toasted bread takes like 5 minutes or more, but I digress. We were not in a hurry. We would definately stay there again. It made a great start to our three week holiday.

When we asked the lady at the front desk ( maryann) abt places to dine in Victoria she said that since it's a ferry ride away she doesn't know what to recommend. I was baffled. Isn't that what a concierge is supposed o do!? And she passed me a brochure and told me to read it myself. She recommended 2 restaurants and both left us puzzled. The food was mediocre and nothing to shout abt. They are Kirin in downtown and the Dining room in Butchart Gardens. I felt that I was wasting her time as I asked her and she appeared arrogant and busy. I would like to say thanks to Kimberly and Jason as they are sincere and helpful at the front desk. The ladies at the lounge were also very personable. All in all, looks gd but if you stay long like us faults appear.

Hence, we decided to try something different and decided on L'Hermitage. It certainly met our expectations in this regard. The rooms are roomy, quiet and elegant and the small touches such as the gas fireplace, teacups, provisions for wine, and separated toilet area are much appreciated.

There is a long thin heated swimming pool mainly, I suspect, for those athletic types! there is also a gym. We originally booked a One-Bedroom Boutique Suite and i asked for a King size bed - the Hotel e-mailed me back and said that, this standard of room had either a queen size or king size bed but that we could not book this in advance. When we arrived only a Queen sized bed was available. This was disappointing but the lady behind the desk offered an upgrade to a One-Bedroom Signature at a reduced rate. We accepted and had no regrets. This room was really a small apartment with a full size kitchen with everything you need to cook and serve a meal also a great coffee machine with complimentary cartridges replenished each day. A nice sized lounge, balcony, two bathrooms (both with excellent showers one with a bath also) a reasonable sized bedroom and a study room which was perfect as a dressing room. Beautifully clean, modern and comfortable I could not imagine anything better. Canada is at present (to those who use the pound anyway) very expensive- food and accommodation. Wine is particulary expensive even in supermarkets (3 X that of the same wines availalbe in the UK). With this in mind the accommodation is good value in comparison to other hotels. We stayed in the Pan Pacifc waterfront also which was of comparable price (and lovely) but the accommodation was a single room without a kitchen or balcony. The concierge was brilliant, we had an unfortunate meal at a restaurant he had recommended (it has since shut down), a sign of his commitment was evident when he then rang the restaurant with our comments he followed this up and later informed us that he would not send anyone there in the future, we agreed to go to another suggestion of his (Cin Cin's) It was again an indication of his and the hotels calibre that we were treated as VIP's and had one of the best meals we have ever had. Although without sea front views the locaion of this hotel has very many other advantages, this end of Richards street is a much better place to stay than the other. Each side of the downtown waterfronts are within 10 minutes walk. there are many restaurants within a couple of minutes (Yaletown, Richards, Granville). There are a couple of supermarkets nearby.

The Hotel also has Gym/Outdoor Pool facilities which we didn't use. A Restuarant was about to open on the Ground Floor. Perhaps even more impressive than these facilities was the attention and support from the Staff. Staff on the front desk & in the Breakfast Room were always attentive, polite and helpful.

To compare this hotel to any other I\u2019ve stayed at would be unfair. You need to understand, this hotel is far and away something very special and unique. For starters, this is actually a condominium property with a segment of the building dedicated for this hotel. Staff is very friendly and more than happy to assist with any question you might have. An example, when I checked in my room wasn\u2019t ready so I was shown to a cool lounge area upstairs (half of which doubles as their restaurant). The one bedroom suite is just that, a huge one bedroom condo with high end touches throughout. The deep soaking tub was a real bonus. As for price, I\u2019m blown away it\u2019s not much more. I\u2019d expect this to go for $400-500/night, it\u2019s really that good. As for location, it\u2019s hard to find something better than this. You\u2019re a few blocks away from the main downtown area and still a few blocks away from the waterfront and Yaletown. The subway system (called the Skytrain) is only two blocks away and I\u2019d highly recommend it coming from/to the airport (same speed as a taxi and way cheaper). Side recommendation, if you like sushi, walk 10 blocks south to Kaide Sushi and be blown away. Other reviews were correct that there is no dedicated restaurant for room service but they are beginning construction on a new restaurant. My only wish (mind you this is a stretch) is they had a higher quality shower curtain and rod. The rest of the room was so high end that the rod and curtain looked so cheap in comparison.

On the last day, I discovered too late that the fixtures were reversed in the washing machine in my suite, so my attempt to wash clothes in cold water resulted in a hot wash and hot rinse, which anyone knows can damage delicates and cause colors to bleed. Finally, a temporary charge (which I was told was for \"incidentals\" - but which was well over $1,300) was placed on my credit card when I checked in and after I paid in full for my stay using another means, I am still waiting for this to be released one week later.

There are dozens of restaurant options nearby, and a grocery store and liquor store just at the end of the block that are easily found and that both have a wide selection. There's no need for a car - two blocks from the SkyTrain and just off of Robson Street it's easy to grab a taxi or hop a bus, and everything downtown is close enough to walk to in under 30 minutes - even Granville Island and the aquarium! The staff were very friendly and non-invasive, adding to the feeling that this was MY place. I kept the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on almost the whole time and yet every time after returning from my adventures no matter how long I had been gone for, my room had been picked up and tidied, with appropriate lighting for whatever time of day it was. The fireplace in the room is flame and heat-less, and very enjoyable at nighttime with the screen-less windows open to waft the smell of rain in to combine with the cozy and modern living area. I had a wonderful experience here - no surprises or let-downs at all except that my iPhone wasn't compatible with the iPod docking station so I couldn't play my own music - easily remedied by the fact that their satellite TV had over 40 music stations for me to choose from.

I would like to say that the elevators are probably the quickest ones we have EVER used! The room was immaculate and spacious. There was a fireplace, but too warm to give that a whirl this time. The front desk staff & conceirge were MOST accommodating. Raymond at the front helped us a few times by booking a Grouse Mountain Tour for us and finding out bus times/locations for our departure. The location of the hotel is perfect! A five minute walk to BC Place, a block to the Robson Street shopping & restaurants galore! It was a bit of a hike, but we walked from the hotel to the Seawalk down by Canada Place and then the whole way around the Seawalk through Stanley Park and back to the hotel. It was a beautiful day but by the end, we were pretty exhausted! The Kingston Grill directly across the street was very nice and also recommended by hotel staff. It was a 'perfect' location for our tired feet. It is a bit 'pub-ish' but exactly what we wanted. Had good service and great food. We sat outside upstairs, which was very nice.

Not only was the room the best room I've ever had, even compared to other fine hotels I've stayed in, it is by far the best value. I broke my review into key points, so you can focus on whatever interests you. Booking the room: I did this on Expedia and it was so easy. The rate was really great ($120), especially compared to Whistler, BC, where I just spent a foretune and got nickeled and dimed for so many things, and it really felt like I was paying extra for every tiny thing. Getting there and the neighborhood: It is in a nice neighborhood with restaurants and just off of the intersection, easy to get to. The building seems to have condos and hotel rooms. The sign is kind of hidden, so keep your eyes open and look carefully for it. There is an IGA grocery right on the corner about a block down. It is an easy 10 minute walk to a Japadog stand and downtown. There are bus lines close by and just lots of people walking around in this area. Room: We had a suite with a king sized bed, bathroom with garden tub and shower and separate toilet, wet bar, separate living area, outdoor patio with a nice view of the street and two tvs. Although there was a kitchen-sized sink and a mini fridge in the wet bar, there really wasn't a kitchen set up at all, but we didn't request one. I'm not sure if other rooms have a kitchen. They had premium cable with two HBO channels and lots of movie channels. They also had a 99 cent pay per movie option. The room was spotlessly clean with plenty of towels, extra pillows and blankets and newish furniture. There were three closets in the room, the most I have ever seen in a hotel room. The view onto the street was great and made for nice people watching. There is also a dining room table with four chairs where we could eat or work on the computer and watch tv or look out the wall to wall windows onto the street below. The only thing I wish they had more of were electrical outlets, but my hotel in Whistler had the same scarcity of outlets, too. Pool, Hot Tub, Steam Room, Gym and Lounge: I just looked at these but ran out of time to go swimming. The pool and hot tub are outdoor, but they are heated. They looked very clean and there were plenty of towels stacked nearby. They said they have a steam room and locker room, but I didn't have time to check it out. The gym equipment seemed pretty new and up to date. They had everything, including elliptical, treadmill, weights, etc. The lounge is large and on the fifth floor behind a locked door, as was the pool and hot tub, so the security seems pretty solid there. It has wifi, a fireplace, ice water, apples and comfy chairs and tables where you can work. That is also were they do breakfast. Other Stuff: The wifi in the room was free, but a little slow sometimes. Free premium cable. Not sure if parking costs extra, but I imagine it does, because it seems like I saw signs for parking prices everywhere in the neighborhood. You might want to check on that if that's important to you. The breakfast came with the room, but I didn't try it. Service: The front desk has someone there 24/7 and although they don't make you use your card to get into the elevator, the security seems ok. The staff was wonderful. They helped us find Japadog and suggested so many fun things to do around town. They also helped us look up ticket prices for activities around town. When we decided to extend our stay a little longer, they let us book a half day extension over the phone while we were out on the town, which was very nice. I would have definitely stayed longer if given the chance and will definitely return here the next time I'm in Vancouver.

Don't let the #20 fool you...I guess some people prefer to pay less for an average stay, or just prefer to stay at large hotel chains. We stayed for the long weekend in May 2009.

Cleanliness: Cleaning staff did an amazing job keeping our room neat and tidy every day. Even the gym, pool, sauna and library was clean and tidy. Rooms: Very clean, modern, chic. Comfortable bed and couch. Lots of room for storing clothes, shoes, etc. Service: OUTSTANDING! Very friendly and knowledgeable. Not one single bad experience with any employee. They really helped make our stay an enjoyable one. Value: For what we paid and what we got, we have no complaints!

It's a great building with a very friendly staff (with the exception of the manager). The studio we stayed in was great; with a huge bathroom, balcony, WiFi etc. We had rented a car in Seattle and drove up so we paid $25 a day for valet parking below the hotel. The day we checked out we called down to have our car brought out. We checked out, waited outside for a 5 minutes and then went back in to see what was taking so long. Apparently there was a break in with our rental. The manager started rambling how they can't control the parking because a third party manages the garage, there are drug addicts who break into the lots of cars, when it's happened before people left expensive items in plain sight..basically he listed every possible excuse....all I wanted to do was to see my car. He takes me down to the garage which turns out to be very well lit and gated. Turns out my little Nissan Versa was absolutely fine but a Lexus and an SUV both had their driver side windows smashed in. They confused my economy rental with a luxury sedan because they were both white. The hotel was nice enough to refund our parking for the trouble and we were on our way. My concerns: 1. It may have been a while but this has clearly happened before, adding a surveillance camera or two could help deter this type of petty theft. They currently do 3 walk-throughs of the garage during the day/night but apparently it's not enough. 2. How dismissive the manager was of what happened. They had comp'd our stay and started listing off all theses excuses of how there was nothing they could do to prevent this before I had actually seen my car. 3. We didn't check out very early so had this actually been my car, when was someone going to tell us. We had already called down for the car, checked out, were waiting patiently outside and then had to go back in before anyone said anything. Thankfully it wasn't my car but that was a bad way to end off an otherwise great time in a beautiful city and in a great hotel.

First, I inquired about a good place to eat and she suggested a place about 7 blocks away. When I wondered about needing reservations she said she'd call over and find out what their wait time was and then ring my room. I never heard anything from her so I made arrangements to go somewhere else for dinner. (Griffins at the Fairmont Hotel was excellent!) Secondly, when I came back to the desk to advise them my schedule had changed and I wouldn't be staying for as long as I had anticipated, she ignored me for well over 5 minutes as she played with the dog who belonged to either residents or guests booked at the hotel. Working in tourism myself, a common courtesy would have been to acknowledge another guest and let them know you'll be with them in a moment. It doesn't take much. I was also disappointed that there was no doorman or bell hop, no assistance with luggage and the internet cable in the room was by the bed.

On our first two nights in the city (before making the trek to Whistler), we had a deluxe king room and our last night in the city was spent in a standard studio king. The location of L\u2019Hermitage was wonderful; nestled between Robson and Georgia streets. It is a $7 taxi ride from the Amtrak station. L\u2019Hermitage has a courtesy car \u2013 a posh, luxe Mercedes Benz wagon \u2013 which was available to take us on two occasions to Granville Island and Stanley Park; eliminating the need for us to negotiate mass transit. The courtesy car was a great service that saved us time and potential hassles. We were able to walk everywhere else. Check-in was smooth and efficient. We had to check our luggage twice with the front desk; once because we arrived ahead of our room being ready and once after our final check-out before our late train back to Seattle. Both times our luggage was swiftly tagged and securely kept for us. The front desk personnel were helpful with our inquiries about dinner delivery options and directions to various stops on our itinerary. One staff member, Bobby, was particularly delightful with his warm welcome and his info on the city as he drove us to Granville Island. Both rooms we stayed in were a perfect blend of luxury and comfort. The king size bed was the most comfortable of all the hotels we booked, with soft linens and comfy duvet. The balcony, with its city side view, and the extra square footage in the deluxe room were nice touches, but we were perfectly happy with the standard king studio. We didn\u2019t expect the king studio to have a fireplace like the king deluxe room. That was a nice surprise. The view from the standard king studio of the recently opened pool & terrace was lovely and tranquil. The bathrooms in both rooms appeared to be the same size, just laid out differently. The marble surfaces and beautiful fixtures were great touches. My only disappointment was with the towels and robes. The terry cloth was not as soft and plush as I was hoping. And the both towels were standard size; not true bath sheets like other hotels of this class. There is a small refrigerator in the credenza of each room. This held chilled glasses and a bottle opener/corkscrew. The attached condo complex also holds an IGA grocery store which was very handy for purchasing beverages and snacks. We found ourselves grabbing drinks from the IGA and ordering dinner in on two occasions after a long day out in the city because the rooms were so comfortable and relaxing. We didn\u2019t want to leave! We stopped in at the continental breakfast on the 5th floor for coffee to go and were amazed at the variety and quality of the items available. I can imagine that enjoying breakfast in the dining room would be a beautiful (and economical) way to start your morning in the city. The workout room featured state-of-the-art equipment and the adjacent changing facilities were a nicely furnished. I agree with other reviewers that the hotel needs to either move the existing internet connection, add another line, or go wireless in each room. The complimentary wired connection was super fast but oddly located on the nightstand. We had no problems with this as we were surfing casually for info on the city while laying on the bed, but this set-up would not work for business travelers. I also agree that the air conditioning in each room is louder than it should be. The vent is located above the door in the hall and I\u2019m sure the hard surfaces in that section help accentuate the noise. However, given the high temperatures during our stay, I\u2019m very glad we were in a hotel with a/c. There was no issue with noise from nearby rooms or outside.

The first two levels are for the hotel patrons and shoppers while the lower levels are reserved for the residents.

The bathroom is BIG with independent shower, tub, sink and W.C. very confortable for a family because you can use simtaneously different bathroom facilities. The hotel is minimalistic with many details that show quality (the walls, the marble, the big closets, etc) Location has been quite confortable for us, we've been to all the tourist attractions (Victoria, Grouse Mountain, Stanley park, etc) We\u00b4re sourranded by restaurants, cafes and boutiques. At night you have your bed turn over with delicious chocolate and they leave a soft light with music. The breakfast is very simple: yogurth, pastries, bread some fruit, enough to start your day. If you don\u00b4t like it you have many options in a minute walk. Staff will really try to help and solve all your needs. Air conditioning is noisy but i solved it unscrewing the front pad.
