The beach however most often holds only guests staying at Hale Mahina. Most of the people we met during our almost two week stay, were extremely nice, and since we were staying at Christmas time, we were even asked to join for Christmas celebration. The beach is nice, you can choose from either hanging on the grass or in the sand. Often sea turtles crawl on the beach and you can go in the water to swim with them. Snorkeling can be done right outside. On specific times of the year you can see whales dancing in the water straight from your terrace / the beach. And the sunsets are to be enjoyed with a glass of wine from the beach as well. They are amazing. There is a barbecue next to the beach, adn people gather there in the evening. The pool is quite nice and especially the jacuzzi section of it is in frequent use. If you are eager to get to know others, in the evening there are usually other guests hanging in the jacuzzi as well. The condo we had was very clean and nice, but the noise from the outside street was overwhelming. We chose to sleep in the living room, since it had a big bed sofa, and it didn't bother us to do so. But the noise from the passing cars was way too much. When sleeping on the other side of the condo, you got to fall asleep to the sound of the ocean waves and wake up to them as well. Strong recommendations to have a morning picnic by the beach to enjoy the beautiful sunrise. You might be surprised with double or even triple rainbows while doing it. The view is magnificent! While staying in Hale Mahina, you will need to have a car or other transportation, since it is quite some miles to get in to Lahaina. There is a small, organic Farmers Market close by (which will even serve you any gluten free things if you happen to need them), absolutely great fresh fruits, smoothies, and anything healthy but delicious. The public transportation offers rides from the Farmers Market to Lahaina, but doesn't go often. You can also rent surfboards and snorkeling gear from the shop next to the Farmers Market. If you stay at Maui, go and see Haleakala, take a trip with the car in the north of the island for excellent views & small hidden waterfalls, visit many beaches in the Kihei/Wailea -area and enjoy the cozy atmosphere in Lahaina city in especially at dinner time.

There are so many special touches: wonderful bedding, books to read, wi-fi, widescreen TV, nice toiletries in the bathrooms, a laundry in the condo (and laundry detergent is provided). No air conditioning means you have the windows open for the cooling ocean breezes, and you can always hear the surf. The sunsets are spectacular, and the turtles are often swimming just off the beach. The condo has a great location-close to Lahaina, a farmer's market, and grocery store. Linda, the owner, is so gracious and accomodating, and everything is spotless (thanks to Rose, the cleaning person.) So often, I arrive at a hotel or condo, only to be disappointed when the photos look much better than the reality, and the items that the owner promised would be there aren't there.

My mom loved her bedroom so much and never once felt too hot.

Now the best part, the view. I can't even begin to describe the sunsets we saw right from our lanai. Plus the turtles swimming in front of the private beach everyday..this really was paradise. The ocean was so beautiful and my daughter loved swimming right until sunset in it. ( make sure you have water shoes, there is coral and rocks out there!) We met Larry the caretaker a few times and he was so sweet and friendly, so I'm not too sure what people are complaining about. You have to realise that some people live here, this is their paradise and some have worked hard to earn this sanctuary and you have to respect that and keep the noise down. I wouldn't recommend this to a family that has a lot of children just for this reason. Better off staying at a resort that is ok with children splashing in the pool with water noodles, screaming at the top of their lungs. The location was perfectly central for all we had planned, and the grounds were immaculate. We hit the hot tub a few nights and really enjoyed the sounds of the surf while doing so. I could I would love to return one day, it truly is a wonderful place to stay while on Maui. It might have spoiled me for hotels now! If your even considering this condo, just book it!

Unit B206 at Hale Mahina seemed to offer the amenities and location I wanted. It turned out to be a great choice. The unit was really comfortable without being overly modern. Even without any refurbishment we found it catered for all our needs. The washer/drier was excellent, the stove had a halogen hob , which was very welcome as I hate the old fashioned metal rings. The oven worked well, as did the microwave and dishwasher. The bed was really comfortable, as was the living room furniture, which includes a bed settee. I noticed the sound of traffic on the first night along with the sound of the waves, but from then on I only heard the waves. I also found that the fabulous breeze blowing through the slats, rather than having air conditioning, improved my sleep hugely. The balcony is really large and we spent many happy hours looking out at the ocean and spotting the whales. They don't come in very close but can still be watched easily through binoculars and decent camera lenses. There are, however, plenty of turtles to watch as they live just off the beach and can meet you face to face if you snorkel there. We really liked the fact that the unit is at the end of the building and was very quiet and private because no-one walked past it on the way to other units. The one problem we had was the fact that the toaster wasn't working but we emailed the owners and it was replaced within a few hours. If I could change one thing it would be to be able to pay the rental by PayPal or Credit Card, but that is a minor quibble. The swimming pool has a hot tub attached, which is not the case in many local resorts, and was another factor in deciding which resort to book. Although there are 4 barbecues on site, only two have their lids. At least one more barbecue with a lid would be helpful, as there was often a bit of a hiatus waiting for the early birds to finish their cooking on the two BBQs with lids, and a lidless BBQ is not ideal. However, we sometimes just ate a little later than we might have done. There are plenty of shops within striking distance, including 2 large supermarkets within 5-10 minutes drive, and with the facilities available we ate in nearly every night. As far as the residents and guests are concerned, we found people very charming and friendly and were invited to a Friday night get together when we had only been there a few days. I think it helps to make an effort to speak to people and then you are more likely to get a friendly response in return. There are great beaches within a 15 minute drive. Try Honolua Bay for fabulous snorkelling, or Ka'anapali and Black Rock for great sand as well as fishes and turtles. About 50 -60 minutes away past South Kihei is Makena State Park with a dreadful approach road and no facilities but with a sheltered black sand beach off which is beautiful coral and turtles. Suffice it to say, it is not our habit to go back to places two years in a row, but it is a measure of our enjoyment and how much we loved everything, we have rebooked the unit for next January to relive the wonderful experience we had this time.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable - we would stay again\u201d", "Author": "JL5627", "ReviewID": "UR90631049", "Content": "Owner Jackie (Arizona resident) is professional, friendly, and helpful.

It seems like 1/2 the units are for vacationers and the other 1/2 are for owners. The condo manager Larry was very intolerant of noise. Granted it was our first night there and we being loud on our balcony playing cards. At 10:01pm, 1 minute after quiet time Larry was pounding on our door. Instead speaking to us in a calm and collected approach and asking us to turn it down and bring it in, I'd describe Larry as hostile and confrontational. Apparantly he had been trying to call us to turn it down but the unit's phone didn't work. - The electrical wiring in the unit leaves something to be desired as light switches didn't always turn lights off and on, it was a game of hit all the switches multiple times until a light finally came on. - Being on the 4th floor in the upstairs master bedroom it was very hot at night and sleeping was difficult without the fan on high all the time.

I stayed in unit A106 and booked directly thru the property owner. I recommend doing this, When you book thru an agency, they do not know all the details of each condo and you may be disappointed with what you get. This condo was beautifully maintained, decorated and equipped with everything you need for a pleasant stay. I cooked all my meals in the well stocked kitchen, with a mirrored wall to bring the outside in. This is a first floor condo, so the access to the oceanfront if perfect. The beach is very close, with green sea turtles visiting and resting every few days. Also, the location is perfect for whale watching during the season, with a view of the islands of Lanai and Molokai. Also included at this beach resort is a swimming pool and jacuzzi.

It's condos, and we were maybe 50 feet from the beach. Overall, the experience was wonderful, couldn't be better for what we wanted, which was a quiet, relaxing time in Maui, the first trip for us both. Sleeping: Ours was a ground floor condo, and was equipped with a single bedroom and a hide-a-bed in the living room. My sister took the master bedroom, and said the bed was very comfortable. I just slept on the couch, rather than fold out the hide-a-bed; I've yet to sleep on a comfortable hide-a-bed, but the couch was quite comfy, with the added bonus that I listened to pounding surf all night and had the breezes coming through all night. Bliss! View: we had a lovely view from our condo and from the green in front of it. The condo sits on a kind of embankment, and the beach is below that. We had a patio, made sort of private by the plants and flowers planted around it, but still providing a lovely view. People in the upper three stories had balconies to sit on and enjoy the view, which included the island of Lanai on the left, and Molokai on the right. Every morning, the sun would come up behind us, and Molokai, which always got some morning rain, had gorgeous rainbows. And of course the sunsets were lovely. Location: Hale Mahina is listed as being in Lahaina, but it's actually several minutes north of it, in a quieter, more residential, and less tourist-schlocky place. Yet, not too far from Lahaina, should you want to go there for restaurants and the aquarium or shopping, and only about 45 minutes (along some lovely coastal scenery - mainly beaches) in to the airport at Wailuku. An easy trek to the famous Highway to Hana. And beaches galore for swimming and snorkeling, all along that area. Amenities: we had a full kitchen, a nice bath with separate vanity/sink area, a washer and dryer, and in the kithcen, a completely equipped kitchen with all we could need to cook meals, including a microwave, toaster, blender, dishwasher, cookware, silverware and plates, cups, glasses, etc. There were even paper towells, scribbies, dish soap and laubdry soap - pretty much all we could need except the food, which we picked up at the Costco on the way from the airport. Flat screen TV and cable, DVD, etc. When we needed staff, we found the manager very friendly and helpful. The Hale Mahina has a pool and a hot tub, and it seems to be a place more suited for people who are not looking to party, but to relax in the sun or shade, read a book, swim in the ocean or the pool, or barbecue (outdoor grills provided). The pool has a sink and a shower, but it there's a sign that indicates no rowdiness at the pool permitted, so if you're looking for a place that your kids can play loudly, as kids like to do, this may not be the best place for you. Swimming, snorkeling, etc: The beach is nice - the tide does come pretty high in, and the surf is roughish, but you can touch the bottom for a very long distance out, and so my sister and I, and lots of others there, swam a lot quite safely. There's rocky areas here and there, and the BEST purchase we made before going there was reef shoes. Those rocks are lava, very abrasive, and I cut my toe the very first time I went out (having not bothered with the reef shoes yet - mistake). We didn't get to go snorkeling, sad to say, but lots did - though we were told better snorkeling areas were to the south and north of us. But in the rocky areas, sea turtles come in to feed on the algae, and we saw some. Altogether, it was a wonderful place to stay!

The only thing that I would prefer Hale Mahina to have is a new coat of building paint. The cluster of condominiums in Lower Honoapiilani Rd are dated, so a new paint would make Hale Mahina a standout. Other than that, my unit was well kept, clean and it has all the things that i needed in the kitchen. We seldom ate out. We bought groceries from the Star Market and cooked all our dinners except for our dinner luau. The unit has folding chairs and beach umbrellas which became handy when we visited all the other beaches.

We were threatened with eviction, unjustly accused of using foul language, and constantly felt we were walking on egg shells.

Our first family trip to Maui and after reading the last post, I feel a bit guilty for not posting after our trip. Here are the pros and cons during our stay- Pros of the Unit A205- Ocean front, water was 40-50 feet away, gorgeous unit, completely remodeled, granite slab kitchen counter, new SS appliances, new bathroom, new W/D, nice new hawaiian ratten furniture, big lanai with gorgeous ocean views, beautiful sunsets. We rented thru chasenrainbows and they were great to work with! You can see pictures on their site. Cons of A-205- everything was nicely remodeled but the comforter on the bed was so old and grungy. I threw it off immediately and wondered why? Everything was newly remodeled and a comforter is such an easy, inexpensive thing to change. Bathroom was really small- 3'x4' in front of 2 sinks and 2'x2' by the tub and toilet area, and not much ventilation so the mirrors really fogged up when taking a shower or drying laundry. The lanai only had a small table and 2 chairs, it would have been nice to have a bigger table with more chairs to eat out there and a chaise as well to lounge on listening to the waves. Biggest Con is NO AC which I thought I would be ok with but I was wrong! There were a couple nights were the trade winds were low and it was muggy hot and hard to sleep. It would cool down if you left your front door open and lanai screen open but we only did it for awhile as this isn't safe with a 2 year old. Pros of Hale Mahina Resort- Gorgeous private beach/ small cove, maybe 25' deep and 80-90' wide, you must stay at Hale Mahina or Lokelani next door to have access. There is a gate and it is locked so you need a key. The beach had grainy sand, it steeped quite a bit and the waves were rough when we went. At night the beach is entirely covered at high tide. Grounds are well kept and beautiful. Great location in Honokowai- 5 min. to Kaanapali, 10 min. to Lahaina, 10 min. to Napili and Kapalua. Cons of Hale Mahina Resort- No shade on the beach in the afternoon, only in the morning is there shade from the palm trees. The ocean does steep quite a bit after only a couple feet in so I did not feel safe with the kids boogie boarding there. We only played on the beach twice in our week stay and went to other beaches. The pool is pretty small and the manager did not want my kids playing with their beach ball in the pool and they were the only ones in the pool! He was pretty strict and we were stunned since my kids were behaving well and just wanted to throw a beach ball around. We also stayed at the Grand Wailea for 4 days after, so we thought, \"whatever, we'll just get our fun pool time there.\" This happened on the 2nd day so after that ,we realized that this was not a young family friendly resort and we just explored Maui all day and came back at night to sleep. There is a quiet time after 10pm and there were a couple nights were there were some people bbqing and having a good time outside but I knew, once 10pm came, the manager came out to tell them all to be quiet and go take it to their rooms. For us, there wasn't enough amenities at this resort for us to want to stay here again. There is an abc store and farmers market to walk to but other than that, not much. You do have to drive to go anywhere which it was a great location, pretty close to everything. We could tell that there were many older owners who lived there and they must want the resort very quiet and have the manager making sure of just that. It would have been a better time if he wasn't so strict and I do remember seing another review complaining about the manager but it was taken off. I hope my review stays as I am being honest about the pros and cons ...you spend a lot of money and time researching for a trip to Maui and you want to make sure where you stay is the right place for you. The resort and the unit we stayed in would be perfect for a couple. The views were great but we were excited to move onto to GW with AC and awesome pools! Places not to miss- Snorkeling at Kapalua Beach, Napili Beach, ocean view lunch Aloha Mix Plate, Brunch at the Hyatt Kaanapali, Torchlighting at Black Rock, Free hula shows at KBH and at Whalers Village, Iao Valley, Maui Ocean Center, Wailea Beach, Keawakapu Beach, Alexanders Fish, Chicken and Ribs, Local Boyz Shave Ice and the Barefoot Bar at the Hula Grill for Lava Flows!

First of all, Hale Mahina is located in an excellent area, and is one of the few condo complexes that has a small, sandy beach. The pool sits in the middle of a lawn surrounded by palm trees on the water's edge. Larry the manager does a fantastic job of taking care of the place. The lanai views are amazing for all units. For the first week we stayed in B402, and WOW! What a spectacular place. They have thought of everything, and it was just lovely, it really made for a heavenly stay. The second week we stayed in B302, an older unit that was definitely in need of renovation. The slider door took 2 people to open, the kitchen and bathrooms were old, there was no deadbolt on the door, to name a few issues. Also, in all units the second bedroom by the entry door gets a lot of road noise - I used earplugs. Loft bedrooms in 2 bedroom units also get a lot of ocean noise from the waves, but who can complain about that? However, overall, I have to say that Hale Mahina was great. Many times we were the only ones in the pool, and there were at most maybe a dozen people in lounge chairs on the lawn at any one time, much better than the resort experience of swimming in crowded pools full of kids. When I return to Maui, I wil DEFINITELY stay there. My advice to anyone seeking a unit there is to look carefully at the pictures, make sure that the kitchens and bathrooms are in good shape, as there is a wide range of accomodations there. As for the surrounding area, there was an outdoor fruit market 3 days a week just down the street, and you are 2 minutes from the north end of Kaanapali beach - there is free parking and beach access at Kahekili Beach park, with GREAT snorkeling in just a few feet of water (as good as Black Rock, we thought).
