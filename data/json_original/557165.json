I really recommend staying here if on a budget! Excellant location, 2min walk to U bahn and near loads of cafe/restaurants. Great for getting around by public transport. Room was lovely, cleaned daily, amazing shower, spacious room with ample storage, huge wardrobe a safe deposit box and free wi-fi if you ask at reception for password. Had breakfast one day here- usual spread of breads, meats, cheeses, cereal, juice and coffee. Nice enough but a bit pricey at 8 euro pp when you can eat far cheaper outside of hotel. The hotel itself was clearly being renovated at the time so I expect it will be far more modern soon. The only points that are a bit down is 1- a dodgy lift. Very small and old and creaky- I took the stairs when I did not have luggage. 2- the staff on desk. Do not stay here if you want helpful friendly reception desk staff. We stayed 5 nights and none of the staff over this time were anything but rude to us even when asking simply for a map of area or even the nearest post box!! Having said that though the hotel room itself is the perfect base for exploring Berlin.

The hotel was a bargain at 40 euros per night. It is very basic, with outdated decor, but it was absolutely spotless, which is the most important thing! The hotel location was absolutely amazing. It is just off Kurfurstendamm, which is great for shopping (any designer you can think of has a shop along there!) and is about 20/30 minute walk to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. It is close to the Adenauerplatz train station, which is just 1 stop along from Charlottenburg Palace. It is also pretty easy to navigate your way around to areas such as the Brandenburg Gate and Museum Island. Overall, for the price I don't think you can beat it.

We paid an incredible \u00a313.50 per night each on a room only basis-obviously! The hotel is charmin.Yes it IS a little dated,but it's fine.Our room was on the first floor at the front of the hotel,we used the old lift -as we had our cases -but used the stairs the rest of the time. Our twin room had a long mirror just inside the main entrance door,to the left and opposite this was the bathroom-with a frosted glass door( a tad unusual!) then there was another interior(glass door ) into the bedroom. We had lovely beds with fresh laundry,a wardrobe,two easy chairs and a desk.Also a flat screen tv. If I'd have remembered I would have packed a travel kettle as there were no tea coffee making facilities( but in fairness to the hotel-none are mentioned in the description) The bathroom had a white suite,a smallish bath,with an adequate shower,also toileteries(for men?!) and a hairdryer. The very neat and quiet,parquet floored lounge area had two comfy settees next to the tv and Internet point.One criticism-I wish the hotel had provided free wifi - we would have stayed in to use our laptops and had a beer or coffee,instead we went out to The Hard Rock cafe(a good 10 min walk away) The staff were very helpful and quite pleasant. Outside there's a sign saying that the hotel offers bike hire.Turning left out of the hotel and 200 yards up the road,was a supermarket (Netto) turn right and there was a very nice cafe almost next door,we had pastries and coffee here for just under \u20ac4 as we were on room only tarrif. \u20ac8 for breakfast we thought a tad expensive. Within a 5 min walk is one of the shopping streets.....be warned....they are all the top brands,with security people on some of the door entrances!! You can catch a tour bus on this street...there are lots to choose from.We bought a \u20ac20 ticket from on of the newspaper stands for The Yellow tour bus,which takes approx 2 hrs to get around this very large city and lasts 24hrs. if we was to return to Berlin,we would stay at this hotel again,but would allow extra spending money for taxi fares or be prepared to hop on the metro to get to more popular areas at night time,as it was quiet in the location of the hotel. Oh and one last thing,we flew from Manchester with Easyjet into Schonfeld airport-we thought we'd read that we could catch a 109 bus almost to the hotel....we were wrong,the 109 runs from a different airport! As we had arrived on a Friday night after work and at 21.20 we decided to plump for a taxi which cost just over \u20ac40 (\u20ac35 going back to the airport on Sunday)", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGood value, excellent location.\u201d", "Author": "Allthingshorsey", "ReviewID": "UR118415994", "Content": "We stayed for four nights, the rooms were clean and comfortable, some small cosmetic repairs were required (ceiling paint in the bathroom dropping off, broken wardrobe locks).

While not a 4 star hotel by any means- there's no chair in the bedroom and the TV shows only CNN, for a tourist they probably don't come any better. We have stayed in 4 star hotels at double the cost and you still have to pay for breakfast on top of that! The bathroom and linen were spotless. 8am seems the busiest time for breakfast so it's much more relaxed between 7and 8, or after 9 if you are feeling lazy. We used the S line much more often than the U as that goes North and South, while most sights are East of the hotel locaton. Although you can take the Adenauer U up to Wilmersdorf, which onlt take one minute, there is sometimes an 11 minute wait between trains. It takes only 10 minutes to walk directly , on level ground, up to Charlottenburg station for the S train [Wlmersdorf and Charlottenburg adjoin] We arrved and used the U as Adenauer was so near but realised that not only is the airport express faster [38 mins v. 1hour] but you can see the countryside as it is not underground. It is a few minutes walk between the terminal and airport but no need to catch the bus as you do to the U at Rudow. The location means it is excellent for a trip to Potsdam-less than half an hour, with some nice views and a rest for weary feet on the journey Probably the only gripe is the 8 euro an hour charge for wifi in the hotel. It costs only 40 cents per half hour at the internet cafe on the main sqaure by the U, 50 cents elsewhere. Although there is free access to the net on the hotel PC it is on a first come first served basis and is very very slow. Any time we were lost and looking at a map we were offered assistance to find our destination We saw all major and many minor sights of interest without organised tours, and with the ABC card, there was no extra cost for Potsdam and Sashenhausen Concentration camp.[ we spent 4 hours there- it is a 'must-experience'. The area of the hotel is a 'comfortable' one for walking out in the evening. A good choice unless you want to go quickly back to your hotel from the major sights during the day. It takes about 20-25 minutes to get back from Friedrickestrasse station, which is quite central. Do walk a lot.

I found the staff to be helpful and friendly - they tolerated my poor attempts at German with good humor and fair English. We arrived quite late, well after midnight and found that the night clerk had been on the lookout for us as he walked out to meet us when I pulled up in front. The downstairs lobby is small but functional and the hallways are spartan, no extra money was spent on furnishing/decorating - my boyfriend wanted to know if we were staying in a barracks. However, once in the room, we were comfortable with feather comfortors, platform beds, a squeaky clean bathroom and shower gel provided by the hotel which I liked so much, I have been seeking to buy it for myself. The buffet breakfast provided is very good - a full buffet with a variety of hot & cold food items - and an excellent value, especially if you consider the price of the room. If you exit the lobby to the street, turn left and proceed one block, you will find a convenient, well stocked little grocery store which should have just about anything you require at a reasonable price. Just before crossing over to the store, you will see a bistro/restaurant on the left - I don't recall the name but the food smelled wonderful and everyone inside appeared to be having a good time.

The hotel is located in the Charlottenburg area, which is a 40 minute train journey from Schoenefeld Airport. The Hotel Agon has a three star rating, which I found to me a bit misleading. The hotel has seen better days, and is need of a complete refit. It has a tired, '70's Eastern Bock' feel about it. The rooms are large, and basic. Bed, table, television, wardrobe and a chair. There are no tea or coffee making facilites. This said, the room fitted its purpose, just someplace to sleep and get ready. It was clean, tidy and warm. The bathroom had a bath with shower above it, and no shower curtain or screen, which meant that if you took a shower, the whole bathroom was soaking wet. Breakfast was pretty good. There was a selection of meats, cheese, bread and fruit as well as eggs and juices, tea and coffee. All this said, I feel that this hotel makes a good base to go and explore a city. If you see a hotel as just some place to say and keep warm, sleep and eat, then it will suit fine.

The hotel's proximity to the bus and subway lines was a real plus. Our room was small, but this was made up for by other amenities such as the recently remodelled bathroom and generous closet space. We stayed in November and the room temperature was quite satisfactory. The reception area was brightly lit and the breakfast room was easy to find on the first floor of the hotel. There was free internet service available near the lobby area. Although the broadband connection was a bit slow, at least there was internet service available and we rarely had to wait in line to use it. The breakfast was served at 7 AM, which was a plus since we had a busy schedule planned each day. There was a plentiful variety of food and an excellent choice of beverages. The morning receptionist was quite helpful and she was familiar with our name right away from the reservation list when we checked in the first day. We were able to check into our room by 10 AM, which was an unexpected plus. The evening guest clerk wasn't as friendly and felt compelled to correct any mispronunciations of our broken German. We would definitely stay at this hotel again based on the value for the money and the excellent location. A bit of quick advice on the bus service: You can buy your tickets in the subway station at Adenauer Platz. Use bus #109 which will take you a mile or two east to the Zoologischer Garten (Zoological Garden) transportation hub where you can get off and catch a bus or use the above ground S-Bahn rail system to travel practically anywhere in the city. Bus #100 takes you to most of the popular sites such as the Reichstag and the Brandenburg Gate. Bus line #200 takes you to the Potsdamer Platz area and other sites to the south. There are plenty of free maps available that show the bus, subway and rail routes. A Tageskarte (one day ticket) works for all three transportation services.", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat base\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5343555", "Content": "This hotel was great as a base if you are wanting to do all the sightseeing and nightlife of Berlin. It is a 4/5 min walk to the nearest tube station and main bus stops and the tube network in Berlin is excellent and works the exact same way as London but is much cleaner, safer and generally more pleasant! (Oh and really cheap - the tickets you uy on the tube also work for the buses - but no one checked ours once over the whole 3 days we were there! - ut buy one anyway just incase - there are machines on the platforms and outside at the main bus stations) The Hotel itself was fine - what you would expect for a 75 pp hotel, pretty basic, very large room to single beds to make a double, but serioursly weird pillows so Id ask for an extra one on arrival as u are bound to need! Also no ironing facilities and it looks like they only have one iron and board for the whole hotel so if you know you are going to need it ask for it in good time! Admittedly becasue we had such good nights out in Berlin we embarassingly didnt manage to get up for the included breakfast - but from what we saw it looked fine - dining room very traditional , clean, no problems. Theres a mega slow PC in the lounge area if you need to check email or anything. Be warned that the room we were in had no shower curtain - the shower was fab with really high pressure and good temperature at all hours but it was very easy to flood the bathromm first time round so be careful! Overall though the hotel was absokutely fine as a base, very clean, comfortable and in a good location, Id stay there again. Onto Berlin itself, a few tips we would like to have had beforehand that we can now pass on!; - The tube network runs througout the night which was excellent and they come about every 20 mins after 11pm and constantly througout the day so dont worry about paying for a taxi if you go out (and there didnt seem to be the usual weirdos you get on tubes at 3am in the morning!) - To get to the hotel from the airport get the bus to RUDROW and then the tube to ADENAUERPLATZ (the light blue line on the map U7 line) - Theres a relaly nice Italian resytaurant a little further uo the road from the entrance to ADENAUERPLATZ tube - You can get the bus 100 from Zoo station (major station you will see on tube map) and the 100 will take you around the whole of Berlin so you dont need to pay the sightseeing tour prices if you are happy to go to the places by yourselves - a weird one.. dont be surpirsed if shops dont put your goods in a latic bag once you have paid - we asked for one and told we had to pay! - BEST NIGHTCLUBS!! (If you like rnb & hip hop ) you will be in your element at H2O CLub [-]h2o-club[-] and 2Be [-]2be-club[-] - none of the ususal London attitude it was brilliant and SO cheap to get in as a female I didnt have to pay either nights!
