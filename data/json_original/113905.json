Our check in was smooth and friendly, and we were helped to our room on an SPG floor promptly and efficiently. The room was spacious, airy and very clean with all the amenities you would expect from a Westin. We had a bay view which was great. We visited the bar for dinner and drinks and were greeted by a very friendly waitress who couldn't do enough to help us. We had cocktails and appetizers - both were fantastic!

On the plus side it's a Westin, rooms of the normal 4 star standard, staff helpful when required and most things are as they should be in a hotel of this status. Location is excellent and the Trolley is just steps away as is fifth avenue and the Bay Area. On the minus, pool was closed for over 3 months for renovation and we only found out by accident through trip advisor a few days before we arrived. (we booked hotel 8 months in advance). We received written confirmation from travel agent that the Westin had Not informed them of pool closure and the Westin confirmed this and belatedly apologised for any inconvenience and said the pool of thei sister hotel 4 blocks away was Available (not my idea of fun having to drag my 4 year old a few blocks for a bit of fun in a pool when I Believed I booked and paid for a hotel with a Perfectly functioning pool) !!! So an apology after the event and nothing more not even a complimentary day or two of wi-fi or breakfast ??? Couple of Patchy days also in relation to the daily replacement of amenities such as Tea, shampoo etc where they appear to have been completely forgotten. Wouldn't lose sleep over this but still mildly annoying in a hotel of this standard and price.

It was great being close enough to walk to the waterfront and the Gaslamp district to check out a few of the scads of awesome restaurants where we had some amazing meals! We did also eat in the hotel often enough, so I got to know the a couple of the bartenders at the hotel bar. Particularly Mark D: a friendly, approachable bartender with a wealth of knowledge of everything on the menu as well as San Diego in general. A co-worker and I came down for a late lunch during a break and wanted to sample a few things from the menu that Mark had described in colorful detail. The spicy fish tacos, California club & calamari were all amazing! He also let us customize our meals so that we were able to try more than we would have otherwise. We really appreciated the flexibility he offered us. Later, when I was looking for something refreshing to drink, he suggested his one of his concoctions, what he called a Michilada: beer of your choice (I went with Modelo), lime and some tangy seasoning around the rim. It hit the spot! And so did all the food. I told him I wanted to take him with me to make all my food decisions with me on a daily basis!

On New Year's Day Thi (pronounced 'tee' - a lovely young woman) helped me personally by allowing me to stay on the line to British Airways for a very long time (and many other passengers too). Eventually Thi 'saved the day' for all of us by speaking to a supervisor/manager and insisting we be given accurate information and be kept informed (everything was conflicting info before this). Thi was instrumental in the passengers being bussed (around 4 pm) and eventually being taken to LA for a flight the following day to Heathrow - arriving into the UK on January 3rd instead of January 1st! Thi took everyone's names and made sure the list was checked and anyone who'd gone for a walk and hadn't returned to the hotel in time for the bus that eventually arrived (only due to Thi - no BA representative ever appeared) was told how to get themselves to LA. I was very, very lucky to have booked the last leg of my trip with air miles and managed to fly out 24 hours later (after being told there was 'no flight'; then there was a flight 'but no seats available' etc -- all very untrue). I hope the Westin San Diego give high recognition to a wonderful young woman who deserves a platinum medal for her patience and compassion!! And the hotel was lovely too!

Pretty much walking distance to everything. The hotel is also very clean and the beds were very comfortable. It wasn't crowded at all so checking in was a breeze....I sometimes even wondered if there were any other guests staying at the hotel?! A couple of things bothered me though. Realizing how close the hotel was to the train depot, I knew there would be a lot of train and trolly noise throughout the day and nights. I had specifically requested a room that was facing away from the tracks, but was given one that was facing the main street (Broadway) so could hear the train horns very clearly at nights. The next day I just decided I wasn't going to bother requesting a room change as I'd already unpacked everything and had settled in. Another issue that bothered me was that I had called the Westin reservations number to enquire about a lower rate I found on their website (where I had originally booked my room a few weeks earlier). The reservations guy told me that I had pre-paid my hotel stay and that that he could try give me the better rate. He couldn't access the system to do anything that evening so suggested he send the hotel a message to assist in making this adjustment upon my check in. At check in I mentioned this to the guy at the reception, but he said he didn't see any message and subsequently summoned another guy, whom I'm assuming may be the manager. He did a little checking and informed me that they never received any message from Westin reservations, and besides, my booking was pre-paid so there was no way it was changeable. This is not what the reservations told me, and I've known of other instances when they would give the best rate possible even though the room was pre-paid. They were polite about this, but didn't seem too friendly, but it was late and I didn't want to bother arguing about it. I would stay here again only if I was sure I'm getting a very quiet room as requested.

He gave us a bit of history, answered all of our questions and made us feel at home. I was in town for the ACN international training event and am extremely glad that I booked this hotel. The staff was wonderful and made everyone feel as they were the only guest in the hotel. When we arrived there were a lot of people checking in from ACN so it was like a party meeting and greeting old and new friends.

This works great as long as you don't need in and out privileges. They have happy hour 4 to 6 in the bar, but I didn't get a chance to try it on Saturday. The location is fantastic, about 10-15 minute walk to the gaslamp, Little Italy, or the harbor. The number 7 bus to the park and zoo is about 2 minutes away and the trolley is around the corner. Housekeeping checked in with me about 2 hours after I arrived and asked if I needed anything which was nice. Because of the burst pipe (and I imagine reading some of these posts) upon checkin I was given a letter explaining what had happened, and apologized about the inconvenience. Since wifi is free in the lobby, and it was in such a mess, wifi was free in my room. I would've given it a 5, but the pressure in the shower was REALLY low.

I called the front desk to inform them of the mess. Five minutes later, this very professional, sweet, and caring gentleman by the name of Nathan Nichols from In Room Dining came with a tray containing Sprite, an assortment of teas, and bread to help me get through this thing. What was even more impressive is he sat with me, went in the bathroom and got me a cool wet towel and placed ut on my forehead. He told me he will stay with me to make sure I am cared for. Never in my 20 plus years staying at a hotel have I had this kind of service, especially nowadays when customer service is pretty much non existent. This gesture truly shows that customer service still exists, one just has to go to the right place. Nathan came back around noonish, and brought me chicken noodle soup complimentary while on HIS break! I offered Nathan a tip for his time, but he declined stating,\"we here at Westin assist our clients for the pleasure it gives us, not to get tipped.\". I am forever a Westin client now.

Second-Expensive rooms and on top of it extra charge for internet.....extra charge for parking your car......30 or 40 dollars a day. Third- Food is terrible! I had room service and it was unedible. So I tried the bar area and the food was also so bad that I took one bite and couldn't eat it. The bartender said he agreed and brought me something else. Fourth- The bathtub faucet dripped all the time, I tried to turn it off but could not fix it. The bathroom was out of date and completely difficult to get in and out of the tub and shower! The Westin in Pasadena could teach this Westin how to treat their customers and also how to cook food that is edible. I have stayed at the Westin in Pasadena at least 10 times.

It was walking distance to the train station and many restaurants. The lobby area was airy and nicely decorated with plants. The room was spacious and included a desk, lounge chair, and refrigerator. However, we ended up having to move to another room because of a leak in the bathroom and the room was smaller than the first. We felt they could have given us some kind of bonus for the hassle and nothing was said about it when checking out. Therefore, we would have to say the service was just adequate. We have had mishaps at other mid range hotels and were given a discount on the room for a night or a discount coupon for one of their restaurants as well as an apology again when checking out. Nothing was said about it at the Westin. In addition, the cost of parking was outrageous. Since the daily self-parking service was not affiliated with the hotel we ended spending $80 just for parking for only 2 nights. If we knew or had the differences in the parking services more thoroughly explained (the 2 options were just mentioned) we would have chosen the hotels valet parking instead. Daily parking meant that anytime you left and came back you ended paying the daily rate twice and more if you left the hotel more than once. Another negative is that WiFi access was not free in your room. If you are spending as much for the rooms as you are, you should get free access at least for a specified period of time.

They were able to answer all of our questions and reccomend attractions and restaurants. The king-sized bed in our room was amazing, we slept very well each night of our stay. We were very pleased to find starbucks coffee and tea in our room as well! The roof top pool certainly looked better in the pictures on their website. The pool and hot tub are in need of repair and cleaning.

The only thing that kept me from rating this hotel with 5 stars was a bad night with a loud party next door--even though that has to do with the guests and not the hotel, it marred my experience of an otherwise perfect stay--more about that later. About the hotel: From the first, all the Westin staff were fantastic! Be aware that there are two Westins only a few blocks apart. Not reading the address carefully, I arrived at the other Westin -- the staff there offered to cab me to the correct Westin, but being a nice day, I wanted to walk. A staff member walked with me, suitcase and all! At the correct Westin, the staff throughout the hotel were fantastic with every interaction every day for all 5 days and nights. My stay was marred only by a large noisy party next door to me on Saturday night. The hotel staff did their best to quiet the group, and eventually, just before the last chance before eviction, the group quieted down. There's no way to know that a group in a hotel will be inconsiderate...but it is nice to feel supported by the hotel staff in attempting to control the situation. The hotel location was great -- just about 4 blocks to the water and in direct line with the ferry to Coronado. Just 2 blocks to the trolley station. For those who enjoy walking, a brisk 25 minute walk brought me to the convention center. At the hotel, the bar has a great happy hour (4-7 pm) every night with good appetizers. The business center is open 24/7 -- a real plus! Outdoor lap pool and nice fitness center. Very clean and neat all around.

There were some disappointments. I suppose I shouldn't complain, I just have come to expect more from the Westin: - the \"complimentary\" internet access in the lobby is really only for 30 minutes at a time, and then they kick you off. I found this out the hard way while trying to send an important e-mail!! I don't care if they only give you 30 minutes, but they should tell you that!! - the bathroom door wouldn't stay open unless propped with something, and since there was no fan in the bathroom we had to use a shoe to prop open the door after showers. just not something you expect to have to do at a nice hotel - the ironing board was covered in some specs of dirt or something. got my nice white shirt dirty before I noticed - the gym. It was fine, a basic hotel gym with a few new-ish machines and free weights, but when you advertise a \"Reebok fitness center\" or whatever I expect something nicer than what you get at the Marriott or Hilton garden inn. It wasn't. All in all it was a great stay, it was comfortable, and it was much cheaper than some of the other options. I guess I just got my hopes up too high.

This was my first stay in this particular property as I usually stay at the nearby Westin Gaslamp (Horton Plaza). When I couldn't get a room at the Gaslamp property, I reluctantly took the room here. I should not have been worried. Of the two hotels, the staff at this hotel was the better of the two. From the valet to the bell person and everyone in between, the staff was exceptional. We were down in San Diego for my son's first birthday (zoo trip!) so we had a lot of \"gear\" for him. The bell staff was extremely helpful in getting everything out of the car, bringing it up to the room and helping us get things like ice to keep his food cold. The valet staff also was very gracious in retreiving toys from the car that this dumb dad forgot. We didn't take advantage of a lot of other services since it was a short trip, but I will definitely consider going there again. If you go, try to get a water view. We were on a Preferred Guest floor and the views of water were amazing, especially at sunset and daybreak. There are only two slight drawbacks which prevent me from giving it 5 stars. First, the room, while an acceptable Westin room, was not as updated as other properties I have been in. To whit, there was no minifridge. There was a space in furniture for one. Second, it is slightly on the outskirts of downtown. Granted it is not a far walk (or a cheap taxi) to the Gaslamp district, it is farther out than the other Westin at Horton Plaza. If you don't walk to walk far, Karl Strauss brewpub is a short stroll up the street from this hotel. A great option for either a business traveler or a family guy.

Service was top notch, everyone was very friendly, gave out great tips for places in the city. My family all loved the fruit flavored waters in the lobby, it was very refreshing and coming in to the hotel after a long day was instantly relaxing, it's a beautiful building. Very happy with the rate I got on Hotwire (and I dont think we were punished by that rate with our room choice, we had a great view). More than anything though I can't say enough about what a perfect location this is for exploring the city on foot. You go a couple blocks west and you are at the bay and it's boardwalk, can see all kinds of interesting ships and aircraft carriers. About 10 minutes walk north of the hotel is Little Italy which had some wonderful authentic restaurants and gelato and is worth checking out. Two minutes walk from the hotel is Karl Strauss which if you've had a long day and dont feel like walking is very close and a cool very good place to eat (their mac and cheese choices are great). and about 10 minutes west of the hotel is the gaslamp district with great restaurants and good architecture. Took us about 15 minutes drive to get to coronado beach and less than 10 to the zoo. Seaworld was about 20 minutes away, farthest drive we had while there. Never having been to the city this is a perfect place to stay and walk around. The Bad: 1)Valet Parking. $32 a day, they will justify this by telling you this is the standard for the city. Then they will drive your car across the street to the clearly marked $15 a night lot (really, stay and watch them do it, it's very insulting watching you pay an extra $17 a night for someone to walk a hundred feet). It will actually take you less time to park your car in that lot than to have them walk over to get it and drive it over to you. I saw quite a few Valet options walking around the city and they ranged from $10-$15 so I'm not sure when the last time they checked out what the standard was. 2)Prices in general for anything else. The buffet is VERY overpriced for how simple it is (good but something like $25 a person for bacon, eggs, hashbrowns. maybe 8 different things to choose from).. Still charging for wifi that most hotels include these days (even those charging much less to stay). The parking I've already mentioned. I know there is a slight premium to staying at a hotel but it was definitely overboard and there are plenty of choices to avoid it once you know the city even less than 5 minutes walk from hotel. 3)Dream bed. We had our kids so we had two doubles. I don't know if you dont get the dream bed with two doubles I'd be curious to find out if thats the case. But if that really was the dream bed then it's very disappointing. The sheets were nice but the bed was pretty hard to sleep on. The dream shower however I loved. That said the positives very much outweighed the bad, we had a great time here and I would recommend it to anyone as long as they understood to never eat here or pay to park here.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey City, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel with walking distance to Gaslamp Quarter\u201d", "Author": "RajSip", "ReviewID": "UR116539332", "Content": "Enjoyed a very comfortable stay with family at The Westin in San Diago.

We decided that myself and son would come down a few days later to enjoy the weekend in San Diego and take our son to Legoland. I am a Travel Agent. I do my research on hotels very thoroughly. I have been in this business long enough to know that there are some times where bad things happen, and one review is just one review. I am hoping that our experience was just a fluke and won't happen again. But we were HUGHLY disappointed in the Westin San Diego. Enough to know that I will not be staying there again and I will not put any clients there! I did like the location. Very close to a lot of things. If you are looking for a nice family place, I'm not sure this is the place for you. The pool is small. Only goes to 4 feet. Our son could spend all day in the pool if we were to let him, so the 4 ft pool was a little disappointing for him, but is something we can deal with. Not a big deal for me. Rooms were nice. Our room had a pocket door that separated the tub & toilet from the sink and the rest of the room. I noticed that the pocket door was only half painted. Like when someone went to repaint the room, they didn't bother to take the pocket door off the hooks and paint it fully. They didn't even bother to shut the door all the way. So there was a good 2 inch spot on the right side of the door that was a completely different color. A few times, our room wasn't made up until we were on our way to dinner. The thing that topped it off was on our last night, Saturday night. We had gone to Legoland, spent the day there. Came back and had a bad dinner at one of the local restaurants. We were tired, cranky and wanted to just get a good nights sleep. Came back to our room at 10:30pm. We noticed that the room right next to us had the door cracked and there was a party going on. At 10:45pm, my husband called down to security and told them about the noise. Security came up and told them to quiet down. We fell asleep until about 3:30am, when something woke all of us up. It was the banging of doors as people went in and out of the door and into the East Stair Way. They were SMOKING in the stairway! In a NON-Smoking Hotel!!! Again, we called to Security. In the morning, we went down to talk to them about our bill. They charged us $20's more than the rate we thought we were getting because my husband added me onto the room. Ok ... even though I wasn't there the whole time, we decided to pick our battles and just pay the extra $100's that we weren't expecting the room total to be that much. My husband also brought up about the 2 times that we called security to have them come take care of the party next door. Not necessarily to get compensation but just to bring it to their attention that we did not pay $200's a night to stay at a nice hotel to hear a party and smell smoke all night long! That is when the little customer service that we already had been dealing with went out the window. They started to say that there was NO record of any noise complaints all night. We were just dealing with one of the girls at the front desk. She kept going back to ask her manager what to do. The manager approved her to take $40's off our bill (very nice and we would have been happy with just that) and as she did that, she completely IGNORED my husband as he asked her other questions. Wouldn't even look at him \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 dead stare at the screen. My husband then asked for the manager on duty. The manager came out and proceeded to argue with us that because there was no reports on the security log that we were lying. My husband even told the manager the conversation the security guard had with the people in the room next door, and that he should be able to track the phone calls that came from our room to security. The manager said there was no way he would be able to do that. But then went to get his business card and was gone quite a long time. When the manager came back out, he did offer to comp our room for the one night and then even offered us breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby. That was nice and is very appreciated but I thought very sad that we had to go thru that whole ordeal. We were not staying at a Motel 6 but we have had better service at one. We paid $200's per night for our room and we expect to get a $200 a night service. I don't believe that we got it at all. Also, the manager did state that the hotel noise policy is that the 1st time security is called for noise, that is the final warning. If it happens again, everyone is supposed to be kicked out. And they are in complete violation for smoking in the stairway. (We do have photos of the cigarette butts in the stair way also.) Obviously that didn't happen. Someone screwed up.

I'm about 7 mths pregnant and so didn't want to travel very far, so we settled on San Diego for our getaway. We had stayed at the Westin Princeville in Kauai last year and had the best time so I was really excited to stay at a Westin again. The smell of the toiletries definitely made me reminisce about Kauai. But of course, this was a totally different experience. For starters, we knew about the $32 valet parking, and so parked in an open lot on C street for $5/day. We had a very warm welcome from Kayti Koelln at the front desk. I asked her for a fridge for the room and I don't think she was able to get me one, but sent up really great cookies and a couple of bottles of apple juice instead along with a hand-written note. Nice! Already more hospitable than Kauai. She also asked for my SPG card and reminded me the waters were free and gave us a Preferred floor room. Nice! The room was average for a 4 star hotel, nothing spectacular. You could tell it was an older building that went through a renovation. And our view was of the skyscraper next door that was under construction. Not that I cared so much since there was no balcony to lounge on anyway. A balcony facing the ocean would've been nice, I guess. Some good things: 1. Being 7mths pregnant and forgetting all my pillows at home, I still had a great night sleep in the Heavenly Bed. The bed was comfy and had this long thin pillow that was great for supporting my belly and between my legs. 2. The fitness area was new and nice 3. The pool was nicely heated to almost body temperature, loved it for easy lap swimming 4. There were towels next to the pool 5. 5 block walk to Gaslamp Quarters 6. 1/2 walk to Seaport village 7. Guest services very responsive when you call them. Some bad things: 1. There was hair that was not mine in more than one place in the bathroom. I know it wasn't mine because I saw it there when I first walked in. There was some on a white towel and some on the tub. I used to camp a lot, so I still used the towels. But man, this is supposed to be a luxury hotel 2. There were flecks of black stuff on the hand towel. What are we cleaning, housekeepers? 3. There are these three things of fruity infused water in the front lobby but every time I tried to get some they were empty! It doesn't help to have the things there to tease us. Put some water in them! 4. Walking back from a movie late at night (around 11:30), there are some weird, crazy people who lurk right outside the hotel and talk to you or the air.

I booked the Westin weekend escape package which offered, complimentary breakfast (nice hotel breakfast buffet which included an assortment of warm breakfast items like eggs benedict, potatoes, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, fresh omelets to order, French toast, and assortment of breads, and fruit) and an extended check out time of 4:00 p.m. My only gripe was the $32 a night valet parking fee, but aside from that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the hotel to others. Great for families, couples and friends! Stayed in room number 1618 great view of the city and bay with Coronado off in the distance. Thank you Westin!!! Tips for the traveler: Give valet a call 5 minutes before heading down for car. -Search for Westin coupon codes before making a reservation. -Become starwood rewards member for free. Provided for two bottles of drinking water each day ($10 value) and a complimentary appetizer with the purchase of a drink in the hotel bar.

My husband & I checked in at 11pm, after a late flight, only to find that our prepaid Deluxe room had in fact NOT been prepaid due to an \"error with the system\". We booked the room several weeks prior, but were not ever informed of this (even after I called to confirm the reservation 3 days prior to arrival and was told everything was all set). We were unexpectedly charged $450 on the spot with no apologies from the staff on the error, and no explanation as to a breakdown of the charges. The desk clerk simply swiped our card, mumbled something inaudible, and then handed us the room keycards, without even pointing us to the elevators. Not a very impressive welcome for a supposedly upscale hotel chain. This particular trip was to celebrate my husband's birthday, which the reservation rep put into the notes when I called to book our room. But no one at the hotel ever took notice of this. I've never been to an upscale hotel for a birthday event where the staff didn't go out of their way to help us celebrate the special event, or at least SAY happy birthday. Additionally, we booked the Westin Deluxe room, as we were told it would be nicer than the standard Westin room. We did have a nice view, but the room looked very outdated, and it had NO minibar! Only a gigantic empty minibar cabinet. I am not sure how any property can call themselves \"luxury\" when the only in-room amenities offered are shampoo, coffee and water. I'm pretty sure the Econo Lodge offers it's guests more than this. We were very disappointed. The wall insulation in the rooms is appalling. If you are like me, and don't enjoy hearing your neighbors gargle, brush their teeth, and blow-dry their hair at 7am on your vacation, then DO NOT STAY HERE. My husband and I travel quite a bit, and we value more upscale properties and spend quite a bit of time choosing more reputable, luxury brands.

I loved the price I paid, I loved the Heavenly bed and the dual-headed shower, and the shampoo/conditioner scent. The location is conveinent to most areas of San Diego and I only used my car to take someone to the airport. and to head out to Shelter Island for the SailUSA11 tour. Used the ferry, 4 blocks away to get to Coronado Island and my feet to get to Gaslamp and the trolley system next door to get to Old Town. I was in a weird room at the end of the hallway and there was an extra exterior door that my room and another shared. Well that door closed when I went for ice. No worries as I had my room key. However, it was missing the complete inards to have the key work. I called the front desk for help and they sent up a room attendant. He promptly realized there was nothing he could do. Another call to engineer and to get someone up to open the door. 20 minutes later., I'm in....no follow-up call from front desk apologizing or anything. Moving forward 2 days....I return from the airport only to find that my key is not working in the door. I go down and have it re-keyed, get back to the room only to have the key still not work. This time I call the front desk and they send security up. He tries several times and he tries to use his pass key, and still it doesn't work. He again calls engineering. Apparently the doors electronic locks run on batteries and when they die, they have to get 'shocked\" into working and then the batteries have to be changed. So after 30 minutes this time, still no phone call apologizing, nothing....not a sorry for the PITA this was again.

I would reccomend if this is your first time in SD as you are close enough to everything and in a pretty safe area (lots of other hotels in the vicinity). As a solo female traveller I felt perfectly safe. The hotel did have a restaurant and a bar which I didn't visit as it looked expensive. The hotel also featured a 24 hour fitness room and pool (not 24 hours) which I checked out and it all looked very well kept, and a massage studio. I paid $350USD for two nights for a room with a King Bed, my room was very well kept, extremely clean, including luxurious toiletries and a robe, I didn't hear any noise and was very comfortable. The only thing the room didn't include was very internet which was a shame however it is available in the lobby area (you have to resign in every 30 minutes). There is a great cafe which appears to be attached to the hotel but is actually an independant business - highly reccomend going there for breakfast - yummy and 1/3 of the price of the hotel.

It is very clear to me that whoever made the room took them and no one is taking action to get them back for me. I don't expect any of you to understand my grief. I lost the love of my life and I wanted to wear the pajamas that he gave me for the rest of my life. I need for you to conduct an investigation and recover my pajamas.

When I called the hotel, they said \"our records show that you asked us to change the reservation to this other name\". I made them fix it on the spot, and thought all was well. Then, the day I am leaving for the airport to fly out there, I get a bunch more E-mails confirming my reservation -- with this other guy's name on the E-mails again! Very frustrating. I had to show up blind, because when I tried to E-mail the reservations E-mail address, I got back a response that my E-mail was \"not forwarded to an agent.\" \"Thank you and have a nice day.\" Really?

I'd heard good things about the Westin chain and decided I'd give it a try. I find it difficult to believe that there are that many hotels around that don't have enough parking to accommodate their guests. Every night I got a different story upon returning from a long day's work. The first night was normal, arrived back at the hotel, self parked and that was that (keep in mind when booking, you'll be paying $24 a day to self park). The next night I came back and the gate to the self parking was closed. I pulled up to the valet area and asked if it was full, and they said no, there are just certain days of the week that the gate closes automatically at night (the building is shared with other businesses). They had someone go over and open the gate, done deal. The next night, same story with the gate. I pulled up to valet and the guy looked at me like he had no idea what I was talking about. I asked if the lot was full and he said yeah. I said that I had a bunch of equipment I needed to unload, could I just pull down to the elevators and unload it / take it up to my room? He said sure, as long as you come back out. I got down there and saw that there were in fact a few spots. I unloaded my gear and tried to leave the structure. The gentleman that takes in money for parking asked where my ticket was, and I explained that the guys had let me in the valet ramp to unload and I didn't have a ticket. He didn't seem to get it, so I explained again. Eventually he said it'd be his butt that would get in trouble, and I said talk to your valet guys then. He let me out. The next night, when I had an assistant with me in her car, we were told to park in the public structure across the street from the hotel, as the hotel was once again full. Now I have to park in an unsecured, open-air structure that isn't even connected to the hotel. A block or two from the city jail. Nice. The next evening, I was told I should park on the street a block or two down from the hotel, seems every other day one side of the street gets cleaned, and I'd be safe if I left before 8am. That was the case, and while inconvenient, it worked out. All in all, not the best experience in terms of parking. I guess the idea is that I should just spend more money and use the valet services. The food at the hotel was pretty good. Issue being, their restaurant closes an hour earlier than it says it's supposed to in the guide book that was in my room. I was busy working till usually 9 or 10 every night at a hotel on the water covering some events. I'd return to my room bushed and ready to relax / have a good meal. Unfortunately for me, dinner was already done being served. Their late night menu sufficed, but still, how about thinking of the people that work a bit later than everyone else. One night I got back earlier, and decided to eat at the restaurant. Got down there, and was told that they had closed at 9 (book in my room said 10). They advised that my room service menu offered pretty much the same items that they serve. Still, sometimes it's nice to not eat from a tray in front of your tv. I was kind of amazed that I had to pay for internet in this day and age. Would be nice if they offered wired for free, wireless for a charge. They definitely don't seem to be catering to business travelers. Lastly, when my check out day arrived, they slipped my invoice under the door. I was given two separate sheets, with similar totals and a difference in charges. When I went down to the front desk to discuss the charges with them (discrepancy in laundry fees, etc) I was greeted by only a trainee. Another couple that was waiting at the counter was amazed as well by this, here it was check out time, and the only front desk staff was a new guy (no issue with him or being new, but that's a hell of a way to get someone to learn their job). He couldn't properly explain what the fee I questioned was, and said it was probably internet related. I said no, this feel (marked internet!) was the internet fee. He took the copies and said a manager was available, and disappeared. He returned sans manager, and sans one of the receipts, and still had the same answer, that the totals were the same and not to worry. At this point I gave up, as I had to be working about 15 minutes from then. Oh well. On the plus side, the heavenly bed was really nice. The air conditioning worked well.

The person who checked me in really didn't seem that he wanted to be working there. My first impression was that I was a bother to him rather than a customer. Having just come from a fabulous week at the Westin in Palm Desert, the first impression here was a real let down. I confirmed that the room that I had booked had two queen beds.

Shortly after we left for dinner with friends for a couple of hours. When we got back to the room there still were no towels or blankets. She phoned again and it took over half an hour for them to arrive. I won't comment much on the room, except to say that the angle of the outside wall made things fairly tight with four people and luggage in the room. Room was okay - a standard hotel room - nothing special. Definitely has been renovated at some point in the past, but not a great renovation to say the least.

My expectations are high when traveling, but I have to say the staff at the Westin is five star in my book and exceeded my expectations.

When I called to speak to the manager, he however was not very understanding and just gave me the canned response about the fridge and how most rooms were the same size as ours. Our closet door was next to the bed and about 12\" away, and we did not have any room for our luggage. One bag had to sit on the armchair/ottoman. Ours had the long narrow cooridor at the entrance and most of the other rooms did not. When I booked (at least one month prior) I mentioned we were a family of four. I would have thought they would have put us in a larger room. Valet was a little expensive, about $30 a day, but this is downtown SD and the lot next door is $25 a day but no in-out privileges so not too bad.

Although some incident are smaler than others, I just noted them because they are exemplary. 1. on entering the BF room, 2 staff members were chatting away. One literally with his hands in his pockets like he had nothing else to do. 2. We entered the buffet area at 8.30am on a weekend. Missing was: bread (really), Plain yoghurt (empty and not available anymore), pancakes (empty), butter (really). I noticed this one at a time and asked for these one at a time. Staff hadn't even noticed it before I asked. Once I got to the bread (4th item missing) I exploded and threatened to file a complaint. Suddenly, everything changed, I got my yoghurt which miracolously was found, we were given a extremely good service, which we enjoyed and thanked for and which is how it should've been in the 1st place. The guy with his hands in his pocket, who had earlier said \"There were so many guest, you guys cleaned out all the food in this place\"(really! those awful guests!) was suddenly helping out too. Just to be clear, I don't mind if something is missign or goes wrong (if it is not too much!) but what I do mind is a total lack of commitment to make things work in the first place. 2. The concierge was keeping it deliberately short to help other guests (understandable, but wrong in my humbel opinion because he made me feel less important than the guest waiting behind me), instead of answering my questions, which were not beyond anything normal a tourist would ask 3. When asked for quarters for the parking meter, I got 4 from a new rol or quarters (really). I asked for more, but he said he needed them in case more customers asked. When I said, that maybe they should stock for more quarters in a centrum district with paid parking, the atmosphere chilled to an unprofessional level, especially in a 4 star hotel.

The Ironworkers start work around 6:30am, so if you have the opportunity to sleep in it will be disrupted by construciton noise.

I truly can say this is the best overall experience I've had at a hotel in my travels. From the time I was picked up by their complimentary hotel shuttle to the time I checked out the service was great. I used the Concierage service many times and all of the people who I encountered gave me great service and info, but there was one employee who worked at the Concierage desk that provided me with \"outstanding\" service and also went beyond the normal call of duty. Her name is Sopia. I dealt with her more than anyone else, but that is not why I'm writing this review. It's because of the extra things she did to accomodate me for my dining needs. I asked her about places to eat on several occasions and each time not only did she suggest a nice place, she volunteered to make the reservations. My last night there I told her I wanted to go to Coronado Island for dinner. It's across the bay from San Diego and I was taking the ferry. She suggested a restaurant named \"Peohe's\" that sits on the water and has an fantastic view of the San Diego skyline. She suggested if I got there by 5:30 pm I should be able to get a window view table. She told me she would call and make the reservation. Well she did make the reservation but did much more than that. Unbeknowing to me she asked the restaurant not only to seat me at a window table with a marvelous view of San Diego she also asked them to give me VIP service. When I arrived they seated me at a table with a breathtaking view of San Diego placed a vase of fresh flowers on my table and gave me a personalized menu that had a welcome to the restaurant from Sophia of the Westin welcoming my party with my last name on it. This was truly a nice touch & something that has never happened to me before. But it didn't end there the waiter informed me that Sophia would like to buy me an dessert on her after my meal if I so inclined. I was really surprised to say the least. She went far beyond her normal duty to make my dining experience a truly memorable one. I also must admit the dinner at the restaurant Peohe's was excellent and was the best meal I had during my visit to San Diego. Not only did she have a wonderful spirit she was a great person, with great insight. My visit at this hotel goes to the top of my list and I would recommend anyone to stay there.

So much for four star service. Although the breakfast buffet was OK, we absolutely hated it when the wait staff came up to us at the end of our meal and gave us a card with their names on it. Text on the back of the card explained that if we mentioned the server by name on TripAdvisor, they'd get a bonus from their employer, Westin Hotels. They directly asked us to write a positive personal review on this site. Sorry guys, but that's not how it works in our books. First you want a tip for a breakfast buffet...where guests serve themselves...and THEN you overtly ask for free advertising and more perks? Having stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years, I have never seen anything so tacky. I'm not sure where pride in doing a good job, a positive customer service ethic and professionalism comes in - but at the Westin San Diego, the staff''s 'it's all about me' attitude ensured that the guest always came second during our stay.

We went to the restaurant for breakfast on both mornings of our stay and the service and food was terrible. The host, manager and servers were completely unaware that there were guests in the restaurant. We had to actually get up and make a request for a server on several occasions. The food on the buffet was cold, stale and unappetizing. My husband and I ended up ordering off the menu on the second morning. We also had dinner in the hotel and that experience was much better.

I wondered about The Westin as I first took the elevator to my room. A group of business ladies commented that they would not stay here again. Before I begin on the negative issues, I would like to report that the Valet personnel were excellent. Though I usually don't use this option, I found all Valet personnel to be friendly, courteous and professional. Most hotels I stay at will ask in advance how many pillows I would like and do I prefer foam or feather. This was not done at your hotel. I felt that the maid must have been ordered to carefully look at the lotion and shampoo bottles to see if a drop could be squeezed out. 4 days with two of us in the room and the lotion and shampoo was never replaced. Towels and wash clothes that had been placed on the side of the tub were left by the maid. Though she did replace them, I didn't understand why she left them. The room usually wasn't made up until mid-afternoon and to be honest, the first day when I returned to my room, I didn't think the maid had been there yet because the bed appeared to be unmade. I then realized she had been in the room, she just didn't do a very good job at making the bed. My wife had left for a run while the made was in the room and when she returned she found that the maid had turned off the A/C. Since it was a fairly warm day in San Diego, she felt this was inappropriate. On our second day, we found that our keys were inoperative when we returned to our room in the early evening. Upon going to the front desk, we were told that they had to reset all the keys. If this was the case, I would have expected someone to have been by the elevators, informing guests of this before they ventured 23 floors up. The front desk clerk didn't offer an apology for the inconvenience. The workout room was very much like a sauna.

They were smiling and friendly and quite different than some of the snooty staff i've seen in some hotels. The 2 groups of people I had most interaction with was the one in the Breakfast Restaurant( I think they call it \"400 West\") and the ones at the Bar in the evening. The breakfast staff had lots of really nice people with whom I used to love chit chatting in the morning , especially Zulema who was a wonderful hostess and always friendly , Juan who used to like talking Sports(the Giants!), Kelly McNorton , Jessie , Omar , Marites and Ramon . It was a nice crew and they ensured that the breakfast there was a fun start to the day. Because I was there everyday , I know that a few times they had to work long shifts, and once even a back to back shift from late last night to morning the next day but they were still patient and attentive. I used to also hang out at the bar for a wine or drink in the evenings. Melissa was the main bartender there and was very courteous and made some nice cocktails too. Jeanine, who manages the restaurant and the bar, was like my San Diego guide and had great suggestions for restaurants and things to do in the city. During my time there, I also noticed a few other guests who mentioned their appreciation of them. The only unfortunate thing in this hotel is the overnight parking charge.

To start with location: the hotel is right in the city centre, close to the Gas Lamp Quarter, or the seaside. Thanks to the very well organized public transportation it was no problem to get anywhere, the train station being just approx. 5 minutes by walk from the hotel. It is quite easy to get to the Sea World, or to go for shopping \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very practical, when your husband is at the conference and you have the whole day for yourself! Although being close to the sea, this is not the place where you could actually swim \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is no beach nearby, just the port. So if you really wish to go to the beach, take a ferry to the Coronado island (from the port being just 10 mins by walk from the hotel). You can have a nice 20 mins walk accross the island to get to the Coronado hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c do you remember the movie \u00e2\u20ac\u017eSome like it hot\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 with Marylin Monroe, Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis? Did you know that \u00e2\u20ac\u017ethe hotel in Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 was actually in San Diego? So, if you love the movie (as much as I do), take a trip to Coronado \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you will love it! As regards swimming \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I am not sure what the weather usually is there, however, despite we were there at the end of August, the wind was quite cold and we did not feel for swimming at all. Perhaps we just had bad luck... The hotel itself: the rooms were nice and spacy, very clean, with all the comfort. The only thing that we were missing was a minibar. Initially I thought that I might use the hotel swimming pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however, the weather was not very nice (it was foggy every morning) and the pool was just above a very noisy street and I did not feel this would be the best way for me to relax... So I did not try it at all... Food and service: very nice food for a reasonable price, very professional service. One thing to mention \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down at the reception there were 4 tanks with water (all complimentary) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one had slices of lemon in it, another had slices of oranges, another one with melon, another one with grapefruit. Great idea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c again something I could recommend for other hotels to introduce! Overall experience: pleasant and convenient for the stay during the conference.

Overall the hotel is a usual Westin and in a nice location. I always prefer paying a little extra for the Starwood experience knowing I'll get something nice and luxurious but this time that wasn't the case. It started at 4am. I was only in town one night but at 4am for some reason an alarm, or what sounded like an alarm, went off for about 30 seconds waking me from my sleep. I couldn't find the source and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fire alarm loud, but way more than a simple phone or alarm clock alarm. Every 45 minutes or so this I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d hear this noise and it completely killed my sleep. The worst part is i couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out what it was or where it was coming from. I admit I didn't call the front desk at that point because the noise was so intermittent and I really didn't want to change rooms at 5am. Finally after really getting up for the day I called to report the problem. The next problem was in the bathroom. The shower had hair from a pervious guest in it and so did the towels. I am usually understanding about these things, but it felt like insult to injury and was simply gross. I did tell the front desk person about both incidents and was comped breakfast/lunch but the only thing open was the bar. I was fine with that but the service at the bar was horrendous. It was a Sunday afternoon and there were probably 3 other parties there yet our service was terrible. Again, usually I love my westin experience and count on receiving it. That is why I'm willing to pay such a premium to stay there. However, based on this experience I could have received the same treatment for much much less.

The food at the hotel restaurant was good. The breakfast buffet had a good selection and was a good value (eggs were under cooked, but otherwise no issues). When I checked in the front desk could not find my reservation at first. Even though I spelled my name, the woman looking it up obviously didn't listen and was looking under a different spelling. Minor issue. The keys I was given did not work and I had to get replacements. Those worked without problems. Minor issue. The room was generally clean. However, there were a couple minor issues where the cleaning should be more complete. Around the shower there were a couple minor issues where there was \"water damage\" that looked less than inviting. Some of it may be a bit of pealing paint because of the water. Minor issue though one that makes me concerned when thinking about such things as molds. It seemed to be around areas (for example, the ceiling) that the cleaning staff probably doesn't get to. While a minor issue, this would be one that I would consider conditional to being able to recommend the hotel to a friend. No venting for the shower. Takes awhile for the steam from a shower to go away which might be part of the cause for the issue mentioned above with the ceiling. Minor issue. Maid service did a good job of cleaning up every day. I was surprised the hotel charged for wifi. Minor issue, but makes the hotel less attractive. Check out was quick. Problem with the billing. I had asked that the entire bill be charged to my credit card and nothing be charged to the other person's credit card. This was not done and I had to call the hotel after I got home to fix it. This was resolved quickly and without too much trouble. However, I was told that the person working the billing dept was not in at regular times and I had to leave a message to get a call back at some future time. That is not even close to being acceptable. A billing problem should not be something I wait on. I asked for the manager and got Steve Kelly (I believe I have the correct name). He was able to resolve the issue quickly (at this point all charges are on my credit card though it will apparently be 7 - 10 business days before charges are removed from the other person's credit card so I don't know if its completely resolved -- I am assuming it is). Besides being an annoyance to have to fix this, it put me in an uncomfortable position because I had promised someone I was taking care of the bill and that person had to let me know that wasn't the case. For that reason, even though I will answer yes to the would you recommend this hotel to a friend, I have to say that its a conditional yes. Lastly, something that the hotel probably could not control was the construction across the street that started at 7:00am sharp every morning. Minor issue since this is outside the control of the hotel.

The building is sort of oddly shaped, heavy on the hexagonal theme, which means that the rooms are also oddly shaped, but it also means that it's easy to spot from wherever you are downtown. Our room was very clean, if not large, and the bed, bedding, and furnishings were all nice. The lobby is very pretty, and the lobby bar is convenient, if expensive even for the area. We visited the pool once, which is fairly small but was heated to a comfortable temperature, and the hot tub was relaxing after a long day of touring the city. The hotel is within walking distance of many great places to eat and drink, as well as the trolley line, which meant that we didn't need a car for the four full (and busy) days we spent there. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was friendly. We had a late flight out, and the front desk gladly held our luggage after we checked out and scheduled an airport shuttle for us later in the day. Other reviewers have complained about the homeless population in the area, which is evident, but not any different than any other large city I've been to, and I never felt threatened or uncomfortable by anyone on the street.

To make it unberable, it was the slowest internet I've ever experienced since dial up! I tried calling the 800 number which handles their internet and got nowhere. I tried the front desk and as I was explaining the problem and the fact I had already called Tech Service they rudely stopped listening and transferred by call back to overseas tech service. I had to call the front desk TWICE and loudly say \"Don't transfer me\" just to get them to listen. Very frustrating! Adding to the fact the buttons on the phone for front desk and concerige did not work -- I could not dial out even to call the tech service...I had to use my cell phone. It was a miserable experience. I was there on business for 6 days but could never connect my office effectively unless I took my laptop to the convention center and used the free wifi. The hotel's own front desk staff told me \"we've been having problems.\" Still I had to pay for it.

I had reserved two rooms under my name, and I also added my SPG number to the reservation. When we got to the hotel, they only showed ONE room under my reservation. Unfortunately I had not brought my confirmation email to show the information indicating there were two rooms reserved. The reservation also showed that I was staying through Friday. I informed them that I had contacted the reservation number the week prior in order to change the departure date. All in all, it was not a big issue, as the manager made the appropriate changes, and added the second room. I did call downstairs once I was in the room, in order to request being moved farther from the elevator. They informed me that since I had requested double beds, they were not able to move me. I had not, in fact, requested double beds, but they apparently had a note in the system that someone had talked to me and noted a request for double beds. I informed them that they had not talked with me about the double beds, and I was told that the note must have been put on the wrong reservation.

The housekeeping was fantastic during my entire stay. Any questions we had were quickly and nice answered by the staff throughout the hotel. The gaslamp district and plenty of restaurants were within walking distance. Parking was steep at $32 per day. It's amazing to me how so many of the hotels charge such high fees for parking your vehicle. There was a parking lot up the street, where parking was $15 for 24 hours with in and out privileges. When we were ready to check out, the front desk informed us that they had us staying through until Friday. I informed them that that had been changed already.....twice.

The price of the room was super reasonable and the appetizers at the bar $5.00 each (which I ordered to go and just took up to the room) were good enough for dinner one of the nights and added to our savings. My only word of caution if your watching your budget is the parking which comes in at $24.00 per 24 hour period and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really per night, so you have to watch your trips in and out as the $24.00 per 24 hours can escalate quickly in your bouncing in and out as the clock restarts every time to head out.

The lack of a charge for my pet and the exceptional breakfast offset, in my opinion, the fee for the parking.

There is free wi-fi but if you want to print your boarding pass it will cost you $6.95 (say what?).

This hotel was on the organiser's recommended list and was one of the nearest priced to a government allowance. We noted it was NOT in the gaslamp quarter, but a colleague with previous knowledge of the area knew the proximity and it was only a short walk to the gaslamp district. This frequently involved passing vagrants but none of them ever verbally asked for money or harrassed us, I guess because verbally requesting money is either illegal or tantamount to admitting vagrancy which may be illegal in the US. Written signs were the most prominent form of request. This is not to detract from the hotel but explain the location and the experience of going to and fro the gaslamp quarter. On arrival at the hotel check in was swift and efficient. As a diabetic I enquired whether there was a refrigerator in my room to preserve my insulin supplies. Unfortuantely this was not standard in my room but the guy at reception promised to see if any were available. Within 30 minutes a porter brought one up and plugged it in. Job done. Thank you. The rooms are oddly shaped due to the buildings octagonal construction, so consequently you cannot complain that they are typically box shaped, well not quite anyway. The room was clean and well presented with coffee machine (Starbucks normal and decaff) plus a selection of teas. Note for Brits: Bring your own tea.. there is probably only one tea of \"traditional\" blend. Although well stocked the pots of milk are \"half and half\" which is okay for coffee... not so good for traditional tea, still I got by by using 1 pot only. Supplies are replenished daily. There is a large flat screen TV as promised with many claimed \"HD\" channels, although I think that is mainly hype as most of the broadcast material is definitely SD. I didn't try the movie service but would imagine they shoudl be proper HD versions. I tried to connect my laptop to the TV and stream videos instead however I had only brought a VGA cable and even if the TV had a VGA port, there was no acccess with a screwed on back plate and cover. However, on one side the TV did have a mini-DIN pin input + Red + White + Yellow... plus a few others so if you have cabling for those S-VHS style inputs I suspect you could be more successful than me. No free WiFi access, but wired and WiFi available in the room at a charge. I used it to Skype video conference back home to my wife. It worked brilliantly the first day (Sunday) but only partially for the others. Whether this was my home PC/home bandwidth or that the hotel WiFi is a shared service and hence there may be more competition on the week days, reducing my percentage of shared access to the internet I could not prove. The bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows and clean cotton linen. The air conditioning was effective and very quiet... I like to sleep cool so this was very beneficial. I did hear the rumbling of trams as mentioned by other patrons (presumably up to about midnight) however whether it was the effect of a modicum of alcohol consumption or pure jet-lag tiredness they didn't disrupt my sleep. The bathroom was clean and tidy and well managed with fresh dry towels when required. The double headed shower was very effective although I needed to ignore the wall plate which suggested turning clockwise to get hotter, when in fact my shower was anti-clockwise... perhaps the inlet pipes were switched on original installation? I used the free gym everyday usually 0630-0730. It is small gym for a hotel of this size but very well laid out in two sections. 1 full of aerobic machinery (Mainly LifeCycle/LifeStyle brand).... 2 x cross trainers, 2 x bikes (1 upright/1 sitdown) and about 4 running machines, sadly no rower. Some had the more modern touch screen LCDs (with integrated TVs or virtualised hill climbs) others are the more traditional red LED readouts. Of the 4 machines I used they were all in good operating order, although toe straps for the bikes would have been nice, but guess that's another nanny state health and safety risk! FYI, when I was there, maximum occupancy was probably 4-5 people. The 2nd section is more of an aerobics studio with free weights in the corner and Aerobic balls, the rest of the area is open and ideal for stretching. with floor to ceiling, wall to wall mirrors. There are a limitless supply of towels in both rooms and a water cooler in the nearby corridor. Both rooms have a view onto the pool and jacuzzi. I didn't use either. The pool is really very small and no good for serious swimmers (which I am not anyway) and more than 3 people trying to do lengths would be it, but it's nice and well kept as I spotted the staff checking the chlorine levels 3 times in the week I was there. Sadly when I may have wished to use it, later afternoon/early evening, the sun had been eclipsed behind neighbouring tower blocks... so perhaps best to use it up to and including lunch for a \"dip\" only. We didn't use the restaurant(s) at all but preferred to take breakfast via the onsite Starbucks franchise where you could get coffee (obviously) but also juice, cereals, pastries, muffins, granola bars etc, certainly enough for a modest every-day breakfast We used the hotel shuttle (FREE) bus to take us back to the airport (it's only about 10 minutes) but make sure you get dropped at the right terminal. Although we were flying back to the UK we were taking a domestic flight to LAX first and not a direct International one. The two terminals are actually quite a distance apart and involve getting on a shuttle bus... also if you've self-serviced and checked in mistakenly at the Intl. terminal but are then informed you have to board at another.. having suitcases tagged but in your posession between two terminals is quite disturbing to the check in staff at teh domestic desks. LOL In summary I'd say this is a good value for money hotel in a pretty reasonable location and if you can manage to save a few bucks and maximise use of the facilities it's probably a relative bargain. Why pay extra for what you may not use?", "Date": "July 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, California", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel.

Evidence: 1) Called after making my reservation online to reserve a crib... was put on hold and nobody ever came back. I called back and reserved a crib via a 2nd call. 2) When I arrived at the hotel there was no crib in the room.. even AFTER calling back a second time to confirm (or really a third call overall after the debacle in my first point). UGG!

This is just somewhat annoying, not THAT big a deal, but when you mention on the phone that you have a family and would like two rooms together... it'd be nice to have the front desk put 2 + 2 together. 4) Finally... on Sunday I called down to see if I could get a late checkout... and again got put on hold and the person never returned!?!?!

We got to the hotel at 5pm and couldn't check in until 6 because they said our room wasn't ready so they asked if we wanted a map or a few drinks...duh! We took the drinks and the map. So they call me when the room is ready and we don't have a refrigerator or a microwave! We called the operator to ask for a refrigerator and they said they were all taken. If they hadn't made us wait until 6pm to check in, I wouldn't have had a problem with that, but since they were all taken and we had to check in at 6pm, I was very upset, but sitll didn't complain. The parking situation is horrendous! To valet it's $32 a day or you can self park for $24 a day. There are a few parking spots with meters, but good luck. Your best bet is to park your car in the lot behind the hotel (the street parallel to braodway) for $17 a day and take a taxi or walk where you need to go (It's $5 a day on the weekends and holidays). Needless to say we did that and never paid for valet or self park. After finding out the parking siutation, I complained to the manager, Jen, and she apologized and gave us breakfast tickets worth $45 a day for the two mornings we were going to be there. The food was WONDERFUL. I would pay for it if we didn't have the tickets. She also told me they would put us on the list for the next refrigerator and see what she could do about parking. After we got our free tickets, we never heard from her and never got a refrigerator. So this morning, I look at my account online, and they charged me $32 for valet when we never used it! I called and the receptionist said she'd take it off but it would take 10-12 business days! This hotel should not be a 4 star hotel.

We were picked up from the airport by the free shuttle, which was very convenient. Check in was smooth and I did ask for a large rom, however the girl insisted all room sizes were the same. I am not sure if they are or not but it didn't really matter as we were there to sightsee and wouldn't be spending a huge amount of time in the rooms. We had a couple of problems with the safe and a problem in the bathroom, but these were resolved promptly. The beds were comfy but the decor was quite dated. I noticed that the powerpoints in the hallway were falling off ,which isn't ideal if you have small children around. Everyone raves about the shower, but I couldn't really see what all the fuss is about. It was an average bathroom. One strange thing was that housekeeping kept leaving clean towels but never took the dirty ones. By the end of the stay we had quite a collection of towels!! The hotel was centrally located to the train depot, the wharf and within walking distance to Little Italy. Wehad no problems getting around without a car which was why we chose a central location. There seemed to be quite a few homeless people around the hotel. There were more homeless people than I anticipated. I was usually with a group when walking back to the hotel from dinner so didn't feel afraid. However, on one occasion when I had to walk back to the hotel alone someone tried to follow me. I did feel a little threatened as it was quite a few blocks to walk from the main shopping area and not alot of places to get help if needed. The Westin was pricey for what it offered although I did get a reasonable deal from Expedia. Would I choose this hotel again.

The location was great and we could easily walk to all the venues. The train depot is nearby and the highway entrance/exit is less than a mile away so it makes getting around the San Diego area very simple. The hotel itself was very clean, felt freshly decorated and comfortable. The room was spacious and everything worked properly. The bed is enormous and we slept very well. There were two 'comfy chairs\" of different styles. We got some noise from the train depot and the ships coming into the harbor, but nothing to inhibit rest. The staff anticipated us running out of shampoo, etc, and left more when they saw we were running low. On my birthday, I came back to the room to find they had set my birthday card from my husband( --which I had just opened that morning )on the bed and surrounded it with chocolates! We attended parties for the festival at different venues and met up with groups staying at the nearby W hotel, and both my husband and I agreed we preferred the Westin for comfort and serenity . Our room overlooked the bay and we could watch the sailboats and cruise ships come in. It is well worth a little extra to us to get that sort of water view. All the employees from the front desk to the valets, housekeeping and restaurant staff, were friendly and helpful. Every single one. They gave us directions and answered questions. No attitude or rush. What a refreshing change after a recent stay at a factory-feeling hotel in Vegas! The breakfast buffet at the restaurant is a little expensive ($18--for me who usually stumbles around at home in the morning with tea and toast) but has a great selection of fruits, yogurts, breads and hot dishes. You can also order a la carte off the menu and there is a coffee shop in the lobby so you can just grab a quick bite. My only caveat would be that despite the convenience of the location, some people might not enjoy the area as there are many homeless who may approach--and did ---even just inside the hotel doors one evening. There is a Greyhound bus station a couple of blocks away and the people you meet on your walks can seem a bit dodgey. I'm from LA and used to that, but I know my family from Wisconsin would be uncomfortable. Area parking is also expensive but worth it to keep one's car safely indoors under guard. Again, coming from LA I find it is a false economy not to pay for parking in a downtown area.

Staying here again would certainly not be the worst thing, there are definately some niceties, but the little things started to add up enough that next time we go to San Diego we will very likely try another hotel as this Westin did not \"sell us.\" The good: 1) We asked for a high floor and received a room on the 20th floor. 2) Great view of the water and sunset. 3) Great shower. 4) Convenient location (close to a brewery; Gaslamp Quarter; Petco Park; WAMU ATM; bagel shop; Seaport Village etc.). 5) Staff was very friendly, helpful and accessible (but not always successful). The not-so-good: 1) The air conditioning either didn't work the first night or has such a high setting of temperature to be useless. The next day we asked for both the air conditioning to be looked at and for a good old fashioned fan. We were advised both would be handled within a short time. When we came back to the room several hours later, there was a note that the air conditioning was fixed, but there was no difference from what we could tell. Also, there was no fan. I called downstairs to the front desk and asked again for the fan; was told again a fan would be delivered to our room; but no fan was ever delivered to us as promised. The bed was very comfy, but because the room was stuffy we got little sleep. 2) We left the room around 10 a.m. the 2nd day we stayed, and when we arrived back around, ballpark, 5 or 6, no housekeeping had been done (we're pretty low-maintenance, but were expecting at least clean towels and the bed made so called down for towels and TP and let the rest be as was). 3) Couple small things: Would be nice if there was a phone book and a TV listing guide in the room as there was neither and... 4) There's no place in the bathroom to hang a wet towel. 5) The day we left, I went downstairs to print out our boarding passes. First, I was unable to access the door with my room card as it indicated to do, so I went to the front desk to get assistance. She also had trouble till she realized they decided not to lock the door any longer so you really didn't need a key (although it did not indicate this on the door but rather the opposite). When I tried to print the pass, there was no paper in any of the 8 drawers of printers or copy machine. Back I went to the front desk where they had to call an engineer for paper as that dept. was the only one who was allowed to load paper. Went back to the front desk about 15 minutes later. They called Engineering again. Engineering was there in about 5 minutes after the 2nd call, but he only loaded paper into 2 printer drawers so I did let them know the copier & other printers were out as well (to hopefully avoid frustration for both engineering and customers later that day). Ultimately, the Jet Blue site would not print out the pass after all my repearted attempts (it was asking for some kind of code for that particular computer that was not supplied or I didn't figure out) so the whole process proved a frustration. 6) I filled out a review card at the hotel before I left AND also an online form sent to me a couple weeks later. I have, as of yet, NEVER received any comment from the hotel regarding some of the frustrations we experienced (it is now 7/27/08 - almost 2 months later - I waited to see if they would send me some consolation - even just a few words - but nothing).", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood example of a Westin\u201d", "Author": "AstroJunq", "ReviewID": "UR18243961", "Content": "This hotel has a great downtown location, a beautiful lobby, very nice rooms and pleasant staff.

The bed was the best we slept in during our 2 week stay, makes it worth it. Westin is in a good location, walk a couple of blocks and you reach the gas-lamp quarter. There are a lot of one-way streets in San Diego, beware of that to get to the hotel garage you need to do a detour when arriving at the front of the hotel. Plus the breakfast buffet was very expensive compared to anything else we ate for breakfast during 2 weeks (including breakfast in Vegas...)", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cRecommended, I guess\u201d", "Author": "WLand", "ReviewID": "UR12106997", "Content": "Perfectly good business hotel.
