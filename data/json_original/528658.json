We were very pushed for time. The room was reduced from \u00a3600-ish per night to \u00a380 including breakfast as part of the deal hence we booked. Seemed like a very good deal however \u2013 key points for us were: Reception is located the Hotel next door where we were met by efficient staff and the adjoining restaurant seemed very to be very popular. We were shown to our room about 50m down the street. The first thing about the room was the overpowering stale smell and badly stained carpet in the room. The bed appeared to be clean. The tap in the bathroom (small wet room cubicle) was broken and got sprayed by the shower (no way of tuning it off) The light in bathroom flickered on and off and was partly hanging off its mounting (safety hazard?) What furniture / room fittings there were were broken Walls were marked stained as was the paintwork Big damp / mildew patch on the ceiling Door handle on the outside of the room was loose. I had to screw it back on my my fingers to stop it coming off in my hand We had a very early start and so did not bother with breakfast On the plus side: Location is good, about 200m from Victoria stations (bus / rail / tube) The bed was clean and did provide a good nights sleep This isn't the best deal we've had from late rooms. It is difficult to see how the original price shown when we booked could be justified.

Oh dear we thought and started to panic rang late rooms back up to say hopefully we could cancel due to the negative reviews they have had. Lateroom's got straight onto the case but called back five minutes later to ask that the manager was not in until tomorrow so we MAY end up paying even if we didn't stay. So I blamed the poor old husband and he took the ear bashing. We went and had a great day out then decided to check in to see what we had let ourselves in for. Firstly we arrived to see a notice on the front door to check in at Tophams Hotel no 28 instead of No 50 which annoyed me as we had walked back and lets face was this place was never going to stand a chance especially as when we walked into Tophams what a lovely bright, clean and shiny reception, so we negatively checked in for Belgravia Mews then to be told that Tophams was not fully booked so they had upgraded us to for the same price, I honestly saw my husband's shoulders lift about a foot with relief so went happily to our room No 4 which was in the basement opened the door and got a really pleasant surprise considering what we thought we would be getting!! then on closer inspection...... there was a really bad odour of damp/drains in the room, the shower lights were not working, a HUGH bath but the shower attachment would only work with the bath taps on, sealing and grouting missing in the bathroom, chips on the woodwork and the carpet could have done with a good clean, the mattress was so soft you sunk in the middle and then the air conditioning seemed to have a mind of its own. However remember we got this at a bargain price of \u00a362.16 including breakfast so should we be complaining probably not! The next morning we remember the clonking noise as people walked through the reception area above but we had things to do so didn\u2019t want a lay in (good job really). We also then noticed no milk or English tea in the hospitality tray so ventured to breakfast. English breakfast luckily for us was included in the price although again I think this was because we had been upgraded as I heard someone enquire if they could have a cooked breakfast. The waitress obviously says yes but it was \u00a319.95, thank goodness she declined. The breakfast was buffet style and when I got there they had run out of eggs and bacon, the rest was all being kept warm under not very efficient chaffing tins. The Danish pastries were excellent though so probably best to stick to continental breakfast. Summary: We did well in the end for \u00a362.16 in the middle of London and were grateful for the upgrade despite the maintenance issues. The reason why I am publishing this on both hotels is to warn others not to pay TOO much for the Topham\u2019s hotel as it does have its downfalls and perhaps try and get an upgrade if you are staying at Belgravia Mews which we could not fault as we did not stay there. All staff were polite but when we pointed out the smell issue not much notice was taken so overall ok but wouldn\u2019t pay over the top for this hotel.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFalwty towers without the humour.\u201d", "Author": "breen9", "ReviewID": "UR123757919", "Content": "arrived no room available, said they would find another then couldn't find key, staff all seemed very confused and pissed off with one another.Eventually after an hour and a half they said our room was ready, led us outside the building down the st 2 a dingy dirty room, no main light working got stuck in bathroom, handle coming off the door.

For example even though I had a double bed, the headboard was actually built for a single :( and I had not 1 or 2 nightstands but 3!!

He trekked back to reception, which was situated 3 buildings away and informed them of the problem in that room. They gave him a third key for another room which he found had clearly been vacated in the morning and not cleaned etc by room service. At approximately 05.10 in the morning he was eventually given a room that was not flooded or unmade but it was foul smelling and cold. However he was too tired and frustrated to do anything about it this time and decided to try and finally get some sleep. However the stench was too much and my colleague had to vacate his room at 06.15 and ended up having to upgrade his train ticket so that he could seek refuge in the First Class Lounge at Euston Train Station. Since then I have been desperately trying to obtain the manager of this hotel to lodge an official complaint and get a refund for the horrific night my colleague spent there. However, it seems that Mr Ali the hotel owner is constantly \"on his break\" or \"in a meeting\" or \"off sick\". I have emailed the complaints email address and called everyday since to no avail. I would never book this hotel every again nor any of his other hotels such as the Topham Hotel in London. Nor would I ever recommend this place to anyone else.

This was substantiated by the surroundings outside our room where there was a huge expanse of ceiling that was hanging down which was full of mould. My husband suffers with asthma and I was worried that this may instigate an attack. After leaving the house at 6.30am that morning, and enduring a tiring coach journey, we were ready to have a wash and change on arrival. Unfortunately we could not do this as there were no toiletries. I had not taken my own as this has never been a necessity in any hotel I have stayed in, particularly a 4* hotel. Also following a long journey, we were ready for a cup of tea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel was advertised as having \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctea and coffee making facilities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Unfortunately this also was not possible as there were no provisions, and had there been, we would have had to make drinks separately as there was only one cup. I tried to use the internal phone, pressing two buttons that showed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcReception\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPorter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 without success. The phone rang but no one answered. Eventually a message said the call was being transferred, but still no one answered. I looked on my booking confirmation for the land line number and again rang the hotel, but there was still no answer. We went back down the road to the Tophams Hotel, noting on route the telephone number on the plaque outside the premises of 50 Ebury Street to check we were dialling the correct number, which we were. At the Tophams Hotel we notified the receptionist of the lack of provisions, and she promised to send someone up with the necessary items. We returned and waited but no one arrived. We then left the premises and went to a nearby caf\u00c3\u00a9 for a drink, then went out for the day, expecting that the room would be replenished on our return. We returned to our room 5 hours later, tired and in need of a shower and a hot drink, but still no one had dealt with our request. We also discovered that we had no toilet paper. We had to go back to a local caf\u00c3\u00a9 for a drink, and then on to Victoria to buy provisions to enable us to wash etc. In addition to the inconveniences outlined above, there were further problems. The tap over the bathroom sink was loose. The tap was also far too large for the sink, and poorly positioned so that even when we had finally bought our own soap, it was almost impossible to wash as we could not get close to the sink bowl. Also the handle to the bathroom door was loose, and had there been only one person staying in the room, there would have been a great danger of being locked in the bathroom without means of escape. The light in the bathroom flickered continuously which was very uncomfortable visually. We checked out of the hotel about 10.30am the following day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our supplies had still not arrived. Whilst dealing with another client; the receptionist asked our name, and without showing courtesy to ourselves or this client, she waved a piece of paper at us which was the receipt for our stay at the hotel. I explained that I was not happy with my stay and requested a refund. The receptionist told me that she could not help and that I needed to speak to the manager. Unfortunately the manager was not in the hotel, and not expected back until after we had left London. The whole experience was totally unacceptable. The premises of 50 Ebury Street are merely a set of rooms and cannot even be considered a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, let alone a 4* hotel.

Definitely would use again and recommend to friends who like reasonably priced B&B's.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cJust fine\u201d", "Author": "HarryfromLA", "ReviewID": "UR8604337", "Content": "I chose the Harcourt Hotel based on its price, its inclusion in Rick Steves and the fact that the TripAdvisor reviews were decent. My one night there met my expectation. At 85 pounds, it wasn't cheap but it was a bargain compared to other places in London. The location on an attractive street close to Victoria Station is extremely convenient. I got in late an was surprised that there weren't more restaurants and places open outside of the train station. I had to walk up a few flights of stairs to my room which wasn't a problem for me but could be for others. When I walked inside I was pleasantly surprised by the acommodations - clean and not tiny with a satisfactory bathroom, though the shower was typically small. Compared to the two star budget hotels I stayed at in Paris and Rome, the whole experience was a cut below but not much. Breakfast was included and was not bad - poached eggs with ham and fruit and bread. The staff was satisfactory. In total, I wasn't looking for much and the Harcourt Hotel served my needs just fine.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cAdequate\u201d", "Author": "marilynvan", "ReviewID": "UR4721127", "Content": "I was a little disappointed in Harcourt. The hosts were not very friendly & didn't seem to be around to help with any questions. The breakfast was average, but they did not let us order scrambled eggs. When we asked we were told they had prepared poached. The tomatoes were canned with thick sauce on top & the sausage was tasteless. No wash cloths in bath. The new drapes could not be closed at night. Would not choose it again even though it is very near Victoria Station, its main redeeming quality.", "Date": "March 21, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Belgravia Mews", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d528658-Reviews-Belgravia_Mews-London_England.html", "Price": "$160 - $1,441*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">50 Ebury Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW1W 0LU</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "528658", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/23/7c/237c51c77e6b60196c5886133d0a73951large.jpg"}}
