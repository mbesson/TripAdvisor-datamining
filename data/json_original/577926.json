Having read some of the reviews on here about the hotel before we went, I was a little concerned but this turned out to be unfounded. We weren't expecting luxury, just a basic, comfortable hotel and as such we weren't disappointed The hotel is in an excellent location for the public transport with a tram stop just around the corner and the Rosenthaler Platz U-Bahn just a few minutes walk away. Many of the major sights are within 10-15 mintues walking distance Our room (109) was on the top floor at the front of the hotel. The room was spacious, light and airy and came equipped with comfortable beds, TV (the only English language channel was CNN), two armchairs, desk, wardrobe, plenty of drawer space, and rather suprpisingly a fridge, cooker (but no pans!) and sink. The bathroom was toilet, basin and shower, complete with hair dryer. Breakfast was excellent everyday with an \"all you can eat\" selection from cereals, fresh fruit, eggs/bacon/sausages etc, freshly baked bread rolls, cheese, cold meats, yoghurts, pastries and as much coffee as you want! There was evidence of recent (but incomplete) refurbishment in the hotel, particularly on the staircases, but this posed no problems for us. In the same street as the hotel there is are a couple of Italian restaurants/bars, an Indian restaurant, a chocolate/cake shop, and a couple of small grocery stores. We enjoyed our stay here and found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. So if you're looking for a reasonably priced, \"no-frills\" hotel this place fits the bill!", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Churt, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBasic hotel in good location.\u201d", "Author": "TravelmanMaidenhead", "ReviewID": "UR16517013", "Content": "The hotel is well located for general tourism. We stayed in room 102 which is on the first floor overlooking the (very quiet) main street. The room is a large double with very basic furnishings including a fridge and cooker(!) This part of the hotel is being renovated but there didn't seem to be any active work. The room and general ambiance did not in any way match the description and pictures on the website, however it was clean and adequate, and everything worked. The breakfast was excellent.

Eventually we were put in a tiny twin room instead of the double we had booked. We complained and were shown to a double but it was nothing like the standard of the rooms on the website and even had an old hob in the corner. The staircase to the rooms had bare splintered boards and the lift only stopped at intermittent floors so we had to carry our bags. The staircase also led onto the street which is a major securty issue. The hotel reception is round the corner in the courtyard so no-one can vet who enters. We were told the door to the street would be shut at night but it was stil open at 12.20am when we returned. The breakfast redeemed itself but I would definitley not advise any-one to visit this hotel in its current state.", "Date": "October 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cUndergoing renovation\u201d", "Author": "cathablom", "ReviewID": "UR10429597", "Content": "This hotel seems to be undergoing renovation, the stairs and floors are stripped bare and some wall work was needed in our room.

Ackerstrasse is a really nice quiet street in Mitte within a short walk to Rosenthaler Str and Kastanien all\u00e9e. Opposite the hotel you find the Italian restaurant Locanda pane which I can really recomment. Also Papa Pane on the same street is good.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "berlin", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "jwfp", "ReviewID": "UR7725549", "Content": "Close to U bann station, TV tower,jewish quarter, and within walking distance of wall and watch tower.

No lift meant a very long haul for a heavy suitcase (even with wheels) and no phone in the room meant a message was not given to me. The breakfast was fine, though... but the restaurant was always about to close whenever I wanted to try its acclaimed dishes. The room itself was big enough, but very noisy - from above, below, and all sides - I really do not like hearing other people in hotels! So for me, that was a great no-no! The area is rather grim, if handy enough to trains, trams etc, but former East German grunge holds no appeal for me. Too many skinheads, too many huge menacing dogs, too much grafitti etc etc. Next time in Berlin (I adored Berlin!) I will be in former West Berlin.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cWould never return to the Andechser Hof\u201d", "Author": "Sorcha1", "ReviewID": "UR6127455", "Content": "This was booked on a recommendation from a guide book. It was like staying in a youth hostel but at hotel prices! The rooms were very, very basic. They were all twins with thin duvets and no extra blankets. There was no proper wardrobe in the room not to mention anything as sophisticated as a phone or a minibar and in some cases hair dryer. There were holes in the ground and the place looked half renovated with no intention of finishing it. The reception was open very odd hours e.g. between 8.00 and 10.30am in the morning on Sundays and did not follow the hours printed on the door so we could not check out when we needed to. There was also no hot water in the morning. I would not have minded too much if this hotel was cheap but it was not and there were many 4 star hotels inner around the same price i.e. 95\u20ac per night.
