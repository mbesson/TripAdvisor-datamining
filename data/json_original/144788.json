Our last visit was April 18, 2012, they offered an exceptional internet deal that included a free overnight room! The rooms have been upgraded and the Jacuzzi Room is spacious, and very relaxing. If you have not treated yourself to Golden Haven, you have not been good to yourself!!! Let me also mention, the massage was GREAT! I have a back, neck & shoulders of steel and Steven did an awesome job of relaxing \"well-overdue\" muscles. One of the many great points of Golden Haven is that as a couple you are together through every step of the treatment - we love it!!!

I have to say that the person who wrote the review titled \"We thought this was a joke... where's the camera?\" gets the prize for writing a review that perfectly summed up our \"spa\" experience. (If you want a good laugh, read her review). We stayed in one of the jacuzzi rooms, which was actually bit better than I expected (having read many reviews that said the place was really run down). Our room and bathroom were not run down at all - quite the contrary... the room looked like it had been redone within the past couple of years. The \"soaker\" jacuzzi's in the room are kind of old and a little funky looking, but they were clean and the water is great, and being able to soak whenever you want in your room was a nice luxury (if you can get past the rotting egg / sulphur smell of the mineral water in your room, which some people complained about, but it didn't bother us at all). I would say the room was very \"average\" considering it's high cost (over $250. a night). Here's the \"mixed bag\" part -- the \"spa\" experience. It started off well with us waiting in a nice foyer, while someone got us glasses of iced lemon water. But once we were ushered in, the experience began going downhill fast. First off, there are signs everywhere asking people to \"be quiet in the spa areas\" but the staff seems to be on auto-pilot and oblivious to the level of their voices, door slamming, etc. We were schlepped into changing rooms, handed ridiculously small bags to hold our belongings, and handed thin bathrobes and flip flops of \"standard issue\" one-size-fits-all, that in no way was going to fit my 6 ft 5 in partner, who was trying to figure out how to fit his sized 14 feet into flip flops for a size 9 woman. : ) Our attendant seemed slightly baffled when we asked for a larger size. Things went further downhill when we were turned over to a very nice young man in jeans and a hoodie - who seemed as out of place in this spa as an eskimo in a swim suit. He was very nice and polite, but not the right vibe for a \"spa\" attendent. Things got really ugly when we were taken outside (nothing but our flimsy thin robes on a cold and wet February day) to stand outside waiting for our \"mud bath\" room to open up. The room itself was scary, dark, dank, smelly, and reminded me of a basement. The mud baths were not what I expected at all -- they are mud mixed with some other substance (reminded me of peat moss), and they just seemed really, really gross. All I could think about when I was sitting in them was how many other people had sat in these same baths since the last time the mud had been changed! Our teenaged attendent returned to the room with such frequency to ask if we were \"okay\" etc., that we only got maybe 2 min. at a time to \"relax\" which was hard to do because he also kept turning out this incredibly obnoxious window fan that sounded like a small jet engine. Our total time in the \"mud\" bath couldn't have been more than 15 min. and that was after we gave up some of our \"hot tub\" time to stay in the baths longer. Midway through our \"treatment\" the teenager appeared with some sort of goo in a bowl and asked us if we wanted the face mud - which he then awkwardly rubbed on our faces, making the whole experience seem even odder. We then were expected to share one shower head, which was ridiculous. The shower was pretty scummy looking, and the entire time we were showing, the teenager was on the other side of our flimsy shower curtain hosing down the mud bath room with a hose. Totally bizarre. We were then taken to another room for our \"heat wrap\" which was the biggest joke of all (I was expecting heated blankets at least), but no such thing. They have you lay on some old massage tables and just wrap you up in some old motel blankets. In fact, the teenager wasn't even going to do this for us (he thought we'd be too hot), but I insisted since we were paying for it! Being wrapped up in the blankets in the dark room might have been relaxing had the teenager and other employees not been standing a few feet away from the room chatting while we were trying to \"relax.\" We then went for a massage. I was holding out that maybe I would FINALLY get a chance to \"relax\" since we were away from the teenager, but no such luck. Within minutes of my massage beginning, and small toddler began shrieking in a nearby room. This went on for at least 5 minutes. The massage therapists seemed amused, but I wasn't, since I was there to RELAX and this was the least relaxing experience I've ever had relaxing anywhere! I had upgraded to the one hour massage, but the quality of the massage itself was below average. I was so frustrated by the time our \"spa\" experience was over that I was actually in tears. Because we stayed for 3 days, in the end our overall experience was decent. I give it a 4.5 for the mineral water quality, a 3.5 for the room, and a 2.5 for the spa experience. Would I go back? Yes, but only during the week when it is quieter, and I'd skip the groady mud baths entirely.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walnut Creek, California", "Title": "\u201cFamily Get-Away\u201d", "Author": "L2meH", "ReviewID": "UR124935218", "Content": "I have been going to Golden Haven for many years.

We found a coupon in our bed and breakfast nearby, and Golden Haven was very highly reviewed and seemed to be a legend in Callistoga. We are not by any means snooty spa-connoisseurs.... but this was the most ridiculous place we've ever been. Highlights, (or should I say lowlights...) *We were escorted into a room that looked like an old YMCA pool changing room that had a HUGE hole in the ceiling and asked to undress and slip into the mud bath. Instead of being given a locker/robe, there was one plastic lawn chair in the room for us to put all our winter clothes on, boots, bra, underwear, coats, etc. A nice guy who looked to be maybe a high school kid in jeans and a TShirt knocked to come in before our naked selves were even down into the mud.... so we hurried things up and plunged down and covered up our dangling bits. The kid in jeans then brings me a face mask that he asks to paint on to my face. I was trying not to laugh because he looked so uncomfortable! He then goes over to my husband and shows him the paintbrush of face mask and says, \"Dude, you want some too?\" We were then supposed to get out and shower after 10 minutes or so and then soak in a hot tub. The kid in jeans told us that the shower was a little tricky--- which we soon found out meant BOILING or FREEZING. We were trying to scrape the mud off ourselves and shower off in literally ice water (while naked under florescent light) when the kid in jeans comes back in and decides to hose down the room while we're showering together in the ice. (The shower has a curtain about as thin as notebook paper and about knee-level... no bending over is recommended!) Meanwhile, our clothes are still hanging off the lawn chair. After the kid in jeans leaves, we run over to the 'hot tub' which is water that has not been changed from every other couple that day. We were sitting in naked-couple-mud-water. Seriously. In extremely open view of the door, which the kid in jeans is hovering behind. Finally, still partially covered in mud and grossed out from the 'hot tub,' the kid in jeans puts a towel in the corner, so we hop out and wrap up in a towel, pick up all our winter clothes and personal belongings in our arms, and then make our way to another room where the kid in jeans says we're going to be given a heat wrap. He pulls the sheets apart of two cots and tells us to jump in. (We're wet, naked, and covered in a bed sheet when he comes back in.) He then puts a hotel blanket.... might have been velour in 1978, but now it's a matted old hotel blanket... and wraps it around us, puts a cold cloth on our eyes, cranks up some music, and tells us to relax. The music was hysterically bad-- so bad that we were CONVINCED we were on candid camera. Finally, after our 'wrap'... (a BLANKET wrap...!)... we were shown into the 'dressing room.' It was a SHOWER. like a YMCA shower!!!! Still wet, still covered in mud, and laughing so hard we were crying, we made our way back to our bed and breakfast. We have honestly NEVER laughed so hard together in our marriage... I guess that's a plus.

What spa doesn't have a dedicated changing room with an area to keep your belongings? All we got was a green mesh bag to hold our things and we had to carry everything from room to room. There was also renovation going on with about 10 construction workers working right out in front of the spa, which is fine, except that we hadn't been warned. We also weren't warned that we would have to WALK OUTSIDE in nothing but our PAPER THIN ROBES and walk THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, up a flight of stairs in order to reach the massage room. This was apparently only because of the renovation, but again, we were not told this was going to be necessary until they came to get us for the massage portion.

To hide the pool deck condition, they have put down heavy plastic mats all around the pool that hurt your bare feet. The actual pool is located inside a steel farm building with exposed columns. It was cold inside the area and they had put up clear plastic tarps on the open wall to try and keep some heat in. Everything in the rooms was very old including the rusty portable electric heater. The staff was not very friendly and was actually rude when asked about a AAA discount. The very next day we stayed at the new Ivy Best Western in Napa for about $80.

I recommend The Golden Haven Spa experience to anyone who lives life like us or to anyone else who is just looking to unwind and reconnect with mind, body, and spirit. Because it's such a jungle out there we frequently put our own health & wellness on the low priority list by taking care of others most of our working lives. A visit to Golden Haven at least 4-6 times per year allows us to continue taking care of others at this pace without going insane. So when you think about it for a second, taking care of others can only be acheived by taking care of yourself periodically. That's where Golden Haven Spa comes into play. You check-in, you're under their care from start to finish. No matter if you live local or far away, Golden Haven is the best place to go to de-stress and recharge your batteries. My wife and I live an hour away and don't have much time for long vacations, so we go to Golden Haven for our \"stay-cation.

Nice and private at all times, the gals were always respective asking if she can come in. The mud was hot and stinky but sooo soothing. Lime Iced water was all over to remind us to keep hydrated. The massages were great especially my 2nd day, Anett was superb concentrating on my areas I mentioned as my stress holding areas. We loved the pool area and were there for hours as all 3 pools were needed! A swimming pool set at 86, a hot tub with normal water set at 102 and a natural spring water hot tub at 108, SWEET!! We talked to a lot of interesting Americans and Canadians and enjoyed that relaxing time...The Golden Haven is great at what they do. I don't mind some young girls being happy at the desk or anywhere for that matter and laughing is great to hear so I can overlook others commenting on the loud desk area. It is the front desk! Our room was quiet and nicely decorated. We had our own parking space right in front of the room. We had a room with the jacuzzi and aside from the mineral water changing colors of the tub it was spotless. We almost cried at the thought of leaving this place. Enjoyed the neighborhood it was in, gave us a chance to walk in a neighborhood like at home and everyone was so friendly as we walked....must be all that mineral water they soak in!!! I liked that little envelopes were left out with the attendants names on it for tips that could be dropped off at the front desk at our convenience. I asked for a extra blanket for the room and got a comfy warm one delivered. Morning coffee was served at the office which kept hubby happy as I slept in a bit more.

We were taken to our room with 2 mud tubs, a large shower off area with curtains and 2 sprays and a little hot tub. Our girl told us how to get in the mud and left us alone to get in in private. After we were ready, she knocked on the door and came in to put the mask on our face and mud on our shoulders. She left and came back a few minutes later to put cold cloths on our heads. Then, she told us to scrape off and go into the showers to clean off after about 15 minutes. The mud was very hot by then anyway. While we were showering, she cleaned up the mud in the room. Then, she left so we could get into the hot tub for a few mintues. We didn't last very long in there, because we were really hot. We toweled off and put on our robes and waited for her to come get us. She then took us to our \"nap room\" where she let us get under a sheet then she came in to tuck us in with blankets and put cold compresses on our head and neck. We were left there for about 20 minutes to relax and nap. Neither of us feel asleep. After our rest, we went to the mineral pool and hot tubs for a little bit and showered and changed in the pool area. It was a fun experience and while I don't think I'd be dying for a mud bath again, I'd go again if someone else wanted to and would recommend this place.

The feeling of being suspended in hot mud removed all of the tightness in my muscles! My husband could only take about 10 minutes of the treatment, but I stayed until I was instructed that it was time to hose down. After hosing down with a mineral water shower, we sat in a mineral water jacuzzi and drank the cold cucumber water solution, which we found refreshing.

Neither one of us has been to the Napa area and we definitely have not been to a resort where you lay around in mud! =) We arrived around 11 in the morning after driving from SF, our room was ready when we arrived so we checked in. Since we booked last minute and were staying 2 days, the first day we just got a room (without any treatments) and the second we purchased the \"ultimate getaway\" package. The only room left was the cottage room so our rate was $150 and the second night @ $160 per person. Upon checking in, the woman who helped us was friendly and nice; very informative about the grounds and taught us how to adjust the water for a non-scalding temp. Our room was right in front of the pool area so we were able to look out to see how busy the pool and sun deck were before actually leaving our room; but we were also right in front of the 10 minute parking area so we heard every time someone parked and open/shut their car doors. Once in the room, the fiance headed to the complimentary water and the candy jar! Excellent choice of candies included gobbstoppers, twizzlers, taffy, etc. We decided to do some wine tasting around the area for the first day so we were out and about. The bed was comfy but was a bit too soft for my liking. Our TV was not working and once we told the lady at the front desk, she was prompt in fixing our problem. We had the mud bath and massage on the second day. The mud bath was interesting.....in a very good way but different from anything I've tried before. The mud is very hot like previous reviewers have said and the nice touch is that they allow you to take photos without being charged. If you do not have a camera, they can take a photo and you have the option to buy or not. The hose really did help with rinsing the mud off, and the whirlpool tub definitely added to the cleaning process. After that, we were shuffled out of the mud room and into the blanket wrap...I almost fell asleep. My massage was absolutely fabulous! It was my first massage and the masseuse definitely put me at ease with her gentle touch and it was helpful that she was describing what steps she were planning to take. My skin was so smooth after and I just felt like a noodle. Luckily, we had our room just steps away so we both went back to the room and took a nap.

We went a little out of the way to Golden Haven Hot Springs, and we could not have chosen a more beautiful eperience! We started with a dip in the pool, which is filled with heated mineral water. We were called in to our appointment by our attendant, Isabel, who helped us into our tandem mud bath treatments, and then applied a mud mask to our faces. We lay, suspended in hot mud for about an hour, and then rinsed off and spent some time in the private mineral spa in our room. Isabel brought us ice water with lemon, which we sprinkled on our heads as well as drank. After that, we were wrapped in warm blankets, while a cool cloth was applied to our foreheads and necks. We both left the spa absolutely refreshed, with all of our joints loose and relaxed. I have arthritis in my lower back & hips, and I felt completely pain free and loose for the first time in days! Even though it was hot outside, we were not overwhelmed by heat. The way the mud works, it is cooler on the surface, so you are never exposed to more heat than you feel comfortable with. This experience was just HEAVENLY! We couldn't believe that we were pampered and spoiled for an entire afternoon for the price of $75! What a treat! When you go, ask for Isabel to be your attendant... although I'm sure the other employees are really good, she goes above and beyond to make it an amazing experience.

Instead, if you get multiple treatments you will have to carry your things around with you as you move through the spa. You will not get a plush robe.

They do provide a blue-colored hair and body wash in the shower. However, you might consider just bringing your own. You'll need to pack the other things, anyway. Also, I thought I was getting a deal by printing out a coupon off their website. However, when I showed up, the price of the service I got was the same as on the coupon. I had three services at Golden Haven: the mud bath, hour massage and hour facial for $225. I never had a mud bath before, and Calistoga is renowned for them. It is a unique experience that I am glad I tried. The mud is hot and it smells bad. You literally hose yourself down afterwards with mineral water, then sit in a mineral water jacuzzi. Next you lay in a quiet room, where the attendant will throw a blanket over you. They call that a \"wrap.\" Next was my massage. Marvis was my masseuse. The massage was mediocre at best. I was surprised that Marvis was also my facialist. The facial was a complete joke. She slathered on a few masks, and was not even in the room for most of it. They will NOT do any extractions!

It would also be nice if there was a game room with video games, fuse ball, ping pong or pool tables. A soundproof entertainment room of course, so that the guest will not be distracted or disrupted by the noise; but to be at peace and quiet environment. I highly recommend this resort to all people.

Sadly, althought I can say we have now experienced a mud bath it is not something I would do again nor recommend as a \"spa\" treatment for anyone. Our attendant was a young man who was polite but after our mud bath/shower/mineral bath we realized he had been sitting outside the door the whole time hearing our conversations. We also we very disappointed with the spa facility, it was old, smelt moldy and was just overall dingy. We were both also shocked that while we were hosing the mud off the male attendant was drawing the mineral bath and hosing the floor down while we were a foot away only hidden by a flimsy shower curtain. Not very private at all! Then the \"spa robes\" we were provided looked like they had been purchased from the local thrift store. No soft fluffy thick cotton robes to snuggle in and like others have noted you are given a mess bag (the same ones used by public swimming pools) for your clothing and you carry them around with you during your treatment. The massage after was ok, but not the quality I expected for a facility which seem to have ranked well with Tavel and Leisure. Also, I was very surprised that my daughter was assigned a male massage therapist without being asked if she was comfortable with that. Although she originally did not seem worried after the massage she stated how shocked she was at how far he massaged her hips and thigh and the fact he got on top of the table to do part of the massage. I have seen that done before on individuals who are larger but my daughter weighs maybe 120 so did not need any extra pressure to massage her back. Our room was ok, but again not the level of quality I expected. We had what they call a 2 room suite which is really a basic hotel room with king size bed in the living room and a small room off the side with a queen. The second room did not have heat nor a TV so we both ended up sleeping together anyhow. This was the same room, we found out, that they advertise for a \"girls weekend\". Very disappointing. We also asked to view the \"couples hot tub room\" since we were hoping it may have been a better quality but NOT! The hot tub is a old dingy soaking type of tub with 4-6 jets and due to the mineral water used stinks up the whole room. No romatic in the least. I have to say overall I would not return to this facility but would consider staying in a local B&B or vacation rental and having a spa treatment at Lincoln Spa which seems to provide more traditional spa treatments.", "Date": "December 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Home Base\u201d", "Author": "tlpumpkin", "ReviewID": "UR11125123", "Content": "Given that the prices at the Golden Haven are so much cheaper than everywhere else, I have to admit I was a little wary about what we would find.

Here are the reasons why I keep returning: 1. Location: 3 blocks to Lincoln (the main street) but in a very quiet neighborhood. Easy access to Hwy 29. 2. Price. The internet specials offered on the web site are a terrific value for the wine country. Check the room & spa packages online. On my last visit, I stayed at GSH while my friends stayed at other hotels. For $304, I received a room (queen bed) with a sauna, mud bath, mineral bath, blanket wrap, 1 hr. massage and 1 hr. facial. 3. The room is very clean and comfortable. Rooms have been refurbished recently. 2 bottles of water, a jar of candy, and a winery guide on a table greeted me on arrival. Most rooms have a parking spot for your car right in front of the room. A/C, coffee maker, TV with lots of cable channels and refrigerator in each room. 4. The staff may not seem super friendly, but I think it's because they always seem busy. I was stuck in traffic driving up to Calistoga and was going to be late for my spa treatments. They could have charged me, but instead allowed me to move it to the next day without a penalty (even with less than 1 hr. notice.) They also let me have a late checkout so that I could go back to the room after my treatment and shower before leaving. What to expect: - water will smell like sulfur because they come from the mineral springs - the facial included in the package is done by the massage therapist right after the massage, so don't expect extractions or a fancy facial from an esthetician. It's still nice though. - no telephone in the room. These days, who needs one anyway when everyone has a cell phone? -wireless internet is pretty weak, so you have to sit in the lobby or just outside of it to connect. General Tips: 1. Best time to visit: late September, October when the fall colors are everwhere and the grapes are ripe. Also, come Sunday through Thursday when it's less crowded and room rates are less. 2. Use the hotel's winery guide provided in the rooms to receive discounts and complimentary wine tastings at wineries. The list has lesser known wineries that are not as crowded and touristy, but have better wines overall. 3. Brannan Grill on Lincoln is great for a nice dinner. There's a grocery store at the end of Lincoln. At the end of Lake Street, where GHS is located, there is a good pizza place where the locals go- called La Prima Pizza. 4. If you like deep massages, ask for Pat. Don't pay more for the deep tissue massage...she has strong hands!

I wasn't sure what to expect, having heard tales from others of attendants shoveling hot mud over you while you lay in the mud, and then being sprayed w/power hoses to get the mud off. Nothing could be further from the truth! The attendant tells you what to do, and then leaves you to get in/out of the mud while she's out of the room. She puts cool towels on your forehead, applies a soothing face mask, and explains what the mud is all about and answers questions. After around 15 min in the mud, she returns to tell you to get out, rinse off (there's a curtained-off area, with 2 showers - one for each of you, with a stone bench to sit on if you like) and then you hop in to the jacuzzi, where you relax while drinking cool lemon water. From there, go to the cool-down room, where you're swaddled like a baby in a room with candles, a gurgling water feature, and new age music (which I would normally hate, but didn't mind becuase I was so relaxed). We had 30 minute massages, which were fabulous! I recommend Marcia - who massaged my husband. I think he got a better treatment than I did... though I was happy w/my masseuse (forgot name). We were given a mesh bag to keep our clothes/shoes clean/dry, and flip-flops to walk around in. This seems contrary to what a previous poster mentioned.

The reception staff were unfriendly and unprofessional. They acted as if they were exasperated and seem inconvenienced at having to wait on us. We felt exteremly unwelcome. We had signed up for an hour mud bath and an hour massage at a promotional rate. Because we were 10 minutes late, our massage time had to be cut in half. Thankfully, we were charged a pro-rated promotional rate. However, the relatively inexpensive price was no consolation for very poor service. In fact, after the entire experience we still felt as though we had been \"ripped off.\" We did not know what to expect with the mud bath, as it was our first experience. This part of our spa treatment seemed very rushed. Our attendant seemed somewhat friendly, but seemed to push us through each of the stages of the mud bath, mineral soak and blanket wrap as though we were in a race. The actual soak time in the mud was about 10 minutes, which we heard, after some research, is probably the shortest soak time alloted amongst all the other spas in Calistoga. During the blanket wrap, we were supposed to retire or even nap in relaxing silence. And despite a sign posted right outside the room requesting quiet, we heard loud laughing and talking the whole time, which made it extremely difficult to fall asleep let alone relax. Our half hour massage was probably the best part of our experience, although that is not saying much. The massage therapists greeted us and bid us farewell very hastily. However, the massage was fairly good, but definitely not near the best we've had. (Perahps we are a bit biased in this opinion because we were already pretty upset by this point.) Overall, we had a very disappointing experience, especially since we had been looking forward to it for a while. We both felt a lot LESS relaxed coming out of the spa than we did going in! We kept joking that what we needed now was a massage since we felt a bit stressed! We would definitely not recommend this spa to anyone. It is much more worth your while to pay a little extra to get much better service. After our very disheartening experience, we went shopping around at several other spas in Calistoga. It seemed like common knowledge among the locals that Golden Haven has a reputation for providing rushed, unfriendly service and for \"herding\" their large numbers of customers through their spa experiences. In some cases, all we had to mention was that we had an extremely poor spa experience and people guessed exactly where we were talking about. That is pretty bad! If friendly, welcoming, accomodating service is essential to you to have a good experience, please do not waste your time here! In spite of the many positive reviews this spa has received, we definitely encourage you to shop around and get a feel for what the locals' opinions are.

Again I think the complaints on other reviews about Golden Haven are completely wrong. The Mud Bath room was very clean and the tubs, shower and Jacuzzi were all inviting. While in the blanket wrap room we did hear a few voices now and again from outside, but it wasn't bothersome at all. All in all, it was just an incredible experience. I think anyone reading this, who may be thinking of Golden Haven, should feel very comfortable with the establishment. I know my girlfriend and I are already thinking of going back as soon as we can.", "Date": "March 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cGreat spa-reasonable prices\u201d", "Author": "wmheike", "ReviewID": "UR2868817", "Content": "A short 5 minute walk to the heart of Calistoga, this spa is off the traffic route that other spa facilities are on.

We were a little worried about the quality upon arriving on the street where the resort was located. Once we drove onto the property we felt better about the location, and only the neighborhood looked \"iffy\". The rooms were nice and the Jacuzi in the room was HUGE!! The natually heated water from the hot springs in your shower, tub, and sink was a treat. We sat in our big jacuzi tub and watched TV for hours. We did the couples mud bath, spa, facial, blanket wrap, and massage. THis experience was heavenly and a much needed stress reliever. It was great that we could go through the whole experience together and not be apart for any of it. The room and property were not what you would call luxury or five star.

We were excited about experiencing a mud bath as a \"COUPLE\". I had seen there website and the pictures looked like it was a nice spa & resort offering a wonderful experience, but looks can be deceiving!! We booked our mud bath and upgraded our spa package to include a mini massage and facial (big mistake). At six o'clock we were greeted by our attendant. A nice girl but not very professional. Once in our robes, she escorted us into our mud bath room. It was awful!! It smelled VERY bad, the room was run down with old mats, old pipes and old everything else. We were told to hurry in to our mud baths so we can be in there longer. Our attendant kept coming in and out and telling us what our next step was. No privacy whatsoever. After our mud bath, she had us get into a shower which was surrounded by old hanging curtains. She came back in and started her clean up duty, as we showered. Then we were told to get into the mineral bath tub (old rusted jacuzzi) as she re-entered our room and proceeded to hose down the shower curtain. Not very romantic. My husband and I were so anxious to get this over with we did not even have a chance to enjoy each other. Once we were in our blanket room she turned off the light and closed the door so we can have some quiet time. But needless to say, right out side our room they have signs that says \"Quiet Please\" it was everything but that. Everyone in the hallway was laughing and talking so LOUD that we had trouble relaxing during this time. Finally we had 2 nice massage therapists take us upstairs to a room where we finally had a nice massage followed by a FACIAL. Beware: Do Not have a facial as you will leave with a BAD Sour Milk Smell on your face for hours. They used some kind of rose/whip cream treatment that left a horrible smell on my face. I could not wait to warn others NOT TO COME TO GOLDEN HAVEN SPA & RESORT for a \"COUPLES MUD BATH OR ANYTHING ELSE!! You will be sorry!! I was hoping for a wonderful anniversary experience but this ended up being a cheap motel spa experience...

I had a week off before I started a new job, so this past week I went to Golden Haven for several days. The staff is very helpful and courtious, the accommodations are very comfortable, and the cost is very fair and reasonable. I especially love the pool and spa. On a warm day it is great, but it is extra great if it is cold or rainey as it is covered and protected. They also have excellent massage therapists.

Its a lovely spring day so why not treat ourselves! We went to 3 different spas with no luck. Our last stop was Golden Haven. Not only did they fit us in they had a room! What a room it was lovely! The french doors to the entry of our room was just the start! We had 2 double beds, high ceilings a complete kitchenette! Sky light that led to the bathroom. The room was gorgeous! That evening we went for our treatment for our mud bath and massage. Now I must tell that I have been a therapist for 20yrs. The gentle and loving way they catered to me was unbelievable! They where right on time. My mud bath was out of this world! All my tension just faded in the heat of the mud. Followed by a whirl pool soak. Then came the body wrap! Oh My God! I thought I was in Heaven! When Paul took me up for my massage I got on the table. Paul was terrific! Not only was he curtious with the draping it was one of the best massages I had recieved in a very long time! I believe Golden Haven has the best staff most nurturing people I have met in a long time! It is nice to know that there are people out there that still care for the humane race.

Well almost. March 27th, 2004, I took my 72 year old aunt, my sister and myself on a day trip. We found ourselves at the Golden Haven Reception Counter, we were \"walk-in\" customers but we were treated like royalty. Barry, not only found a suite for us, we received every service available at the times we wanted. This was absolutely amazing, as we had already stopped at three other spa resorts and could only receive one or none of the services we wanted. I have always been a skeptic as to mud bathing, however my assistant, Theresa, made the experience comforting and secure, to my surprise like floating on warm fluffy clouds. My aunt, Minda was a first timer as well and she was so pleased with the transforming therapies that she will return every year with her visits to California, her words,\"I've found the fountain of youth, the best gift anyone could ever receive.\" The massage therapists, the staff were very courteous and caring, making sure to provide us with every comfort. Our facials, unbelievable, what a service, more like a circular body massage, so impressive. I am a WorldMark/Interval International/Trendwest Owner and I must say this has equalled if not surpassed the personal care and courtesy we received at Golden Haven Spa.
