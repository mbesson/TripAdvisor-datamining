The 'ensuite' is tiny - in mine and my husbands room if you ran the tap in the sink 'water' would come bubbling up from the shower and fill the room with the most rancid smell. In my sister's room the hot water tap had come off and the shower dripped all night.

First impressions were not great as my En-suite room turned out to be about 4ft X 12ft with a 2'6\" bed. The room was filthy to say the least, with an accumulation of dust and dirt in the corners and a worn out and stained carpet. The window sill was black with dirt and water marks and the only working light in the room was a bare bulb (the bedside wall light didn't work) The shower room was so small that one could sit on the toilet, wash your hair in the sink and wash your feet in the shower all at the same time! You would need to be a contortionest to use it and god help anyone who has impaired movement. The shower was either a freezing drizzle or a boiling torrent, the fixed head only showered the oposite wall and the mixer came out of two large, ungrouted, holes in the tiles. The water in the wash basin was a mere drizzle and never got hotter than about 20 degrees C. The bathroom extractor fan barely worked from being clogged by filth. The sheets, at first sight, appeared to be clean, if not the rest of the linen. However, looks can be deceptive and I left with several septic bites on my person and developed a rather nasty rash on my face. Wheather this is from the obvious infestation or from their detergent I don't know. I suspect the former! The only way to sleep was with the aid of ear plugs due to the snoring from the room next door. I cannot comment on the \"continental\" breakfast, which, as far as I can gather, consists of toast and orange juice. I concluded that, given the standard of cleaning in the public areas, the same care and attention to cleaning was not likely to be lavished on the private kitchen. Yes, this is budget accomodation. BUT there is budget and budget! The room I was in was \u00c2\u00a335 per night. Not a great deal of money, but considering I could have had a large, clean and comfortable en-suite room at somewhere like travel lodge or premier inn for about \u00c2\u00a356, it's put in persective. Which is why I suspect that they insist on full payment for the duration of your stay BEFORE they show you your \"room\".

Curtains only just fit windows and are never pulled right making the room look sightly instantly, Never any lamp shades on main lights on the wall lights if there is a shade then it is dirty and scorched! Fridges are dirty in room. They use the furniture in the rooms to store their spare linen. Breakfast is a joke! the orange juice is a watered down contcentrate, tea, coffee and toast with butter and jams.

I do realise that you get what you pay for, in London in particular, and for \u00c2\u00a335 per night you'd be silly to expect too much. The thing that put me over the edge, however, was waking up to bedbugs scurrying away over the sheets and up the walls and after feasting on us all night! When you do the research on bedbugs, which I've now done ad naseum, you discover that once you've been exposed to them, they have a tendancy to follow you home. Unfortunately they did and so we've now had the bug man in to spray our place, which wasn't cheap. We've also done five gazillion loads of laundry and will need to dryclean whatever can't be washed. All clothes, shoes, books etc had to be removed from the house, sealed in plastic bin liners and can't be brought back in until they've been hot washed or sprayed.

I also had my 10 year-old son with me and I wondered if the bed had bugs (although I didn't see evidence of this). We got our luggage and expected that now we were out the $220 Canadian. The staff person was very nice and appeared apologetic and offered the refund form to us before us really asking for it. He did not know whether the owner would authorize it but we filled it anyway. I am just hoping the money has been refunded to my credit card. We headed into London at 10 o'clock at night to find a different hotel. Luckily we managed to find a fairly decent one, but it cost a lot more money.

It was so bad by the Reception Desk, it was like walking through fog. Our room was opposite said desk, and that filled up with cigarette smoke as well. The room or should I say box; housed twin beds pushed together, squashed in with a bedside cabinet, a large fridge(?), a minute wardrobe, and an ensuite - I use the words lightly - the ensuite was no bigger than a cupboard - to wipe your bits you had to stand outside. The dirt, cobwebs, and filth was undescribable. The carpet was never hoovered, and God knows what the black sticky mess was. There was scuff marks on the walls; the curtains and the windows didn't fit, and the wind kept on blowing in. The headboards were underneath the windows, so there was no getting away from it. Housekeeping was to change the towels from 4 to 3 to 2 and nothing else on a daily basis. No beds were made, no bins emptied, no basins/showers etc were cleaned - it was a disgrace. Electric plugs sellotaped over, wires hanging all over the place - even in the ensuite - we honestly thought it was a joke. The car park was filled with dirty, smelling water?, old beds, bed bases, smashed cupboards/wardrobes/sinks/ gym kit, amongst other unmentionable items. This was what the guest saw first on arrival, and constantly at breakfast. The icing on the cake was a pubic hair in my husband's saucer on the second day, and cigarette ash on the table. We fully appreciate that this was at the lower end on the price/market range, but there's no excuse for any of the above. It doesn't take a great deal to empty bins, etc and keep the place clean.
