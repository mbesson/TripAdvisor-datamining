On arrival at 11am we knew that we were too early to check in and we acknowledged that to reception but asked could we leave our suitcases in reception. The receptionist agreed and told us to come back at 12.15 when our room would be ready. When we arrived back (after 1pm) another individual was covering reception, who informed us that actually our room was not ready and he could not tell us when it would be ready!!!! This was despite my reservation confirming checking in available from 1pm. So, off we went wandering again did not arrive back to the hotel till after 4pm. Finally, we were checked in. Based on the positive reviews and the price paid for a standard room with breakfast I expected a small, basic but clean room with a reasonably comfortable bed to enjoy a good nights sleep before our cruise. Unfortunately the grim reality fell some way short of that. On unlocking our door the room was certainly small as I had expected, but was also badly in need of redecoration - the wall paint was filthy in areas. The view was abysmal - not so much 'internal courtyard' as a tall wall and fence blocking out all light. The room was also a weird layout - imagine if you will a square divided in four - top left hand is bed, bottom left hand is desk with TV, top right hand is wardrobe, bottom left hand is small sofa. It was not possible to watch TV while sitting or lying on the bed. I guess I could have overlooked these things if I had managed to get a good nights sleep, but unfortunately much of our night was disturbed by music, shouting and yelling from some function room nearby, and this went on into the early hours. Our bed was also hard as a rock, with one pathetic thin pillow each. It was not possible to sit up or to prop oneself up on the bed comfortably either, hence the TV issue. In summary, I spent the most uncomfortable night of my life at this place. I thought that at least we would be able to enjoy a decent breakfast before we set off for the port. There too I was mistaken. Breakfast was a collection of singularly unappetizing items such as a burnt and congealed mess of scrambled eggs .... Bacon which was 90% fat and 10% bacon. Etc. etc. Even the cereal was revolting - cheap stuff saturated with sugar. Thankfully we were only there one night - if any longer I would have had to move to another hotel.

We arrived on Monday and after being ignored by the woman behind the desk were allocated a room in the older part of the hotel. We went up to the room and as soon as I walked into the room I felt like crying. It was extremely dark, boiling and tiny. The bed was barely a double and was pushed up against the wall at one side, over the top of the other side was a shelf which meant that you couldn't at anypoint sit up in bed. When we sat on the bed it was rock hard and when my partner lay on the bed I was left a small area. This would have meant I would have lay on my side all night to fit, this is rather worrying as my parner is an average size man - not overweight. The rest of the room was grim to say the least, no space to move and extremely tired looking. At one point my OH attempted to open the wardrobe and the door basically came off the rails. There was almost no natural light, just a small window which opened on to a lightwell which looked out onto a wall. I stood trying to look out of the high window and commented about how it reminded me of prison scenes. At this point my OH decided to go downstairs to complain. He said he was dealt with quickly and the woman on reception didn't seem too suprised. We were then allocated a room in the newer part of the hotel and told thats all they had available. To get to the new part we had to go up 2 floors in 1 lift, go along another corridor into a newer bit, go up 8 steps (dragging our cases), then along another winding corridor and then into a tiny old fashioned lift for another 2 floors. We then eventually found our rooms. No one at any point offered to help us to our rooms or to carry our cases, despite the fact there seemed to be a doorman and it was a maze. When we got the next room it was still small but was brighter (still with a window out to a lightwell and a view of walls), the lay out was better in that the bed was slightly bigger and not pushed up against the wall. However it was boiling again, so we left our stuff and asked reception to sort out the heat (I was bright red at this point from the excessive heat in the rooms). They did sort the heating out, but we had to leave the AC on all the time, which was noisy and spat out stone/ dirt throughout the day/ night. The new room was okay, however it was extremely noisy apart from the AC - there were 2 building sites either side of the hotel which meant that you needed to leave your room from 9am-5pm. It was just as bad and at night. You could hear everything, the noisy lift, people walking and talking, none stop banging, etc. I could hear the people next door using the toilet and the lady must have been very ill because she was throwing up each morning we were there. I have concluded the walls must be made of cardboard! We paid for breakfast when we booked our room, which was grim and was meant to be 15 euros each...lets just say it wasn't worth it and I actually felt sick after eating, we didn't even bother going one morning as we couldn't face it. All in all a terrible hotel, the staff never asked if we had enjoyed our stay as we checked out...hopefully because they were too embarrassed!!!!!! If I could have got some money back from the hotel I would have happily gone elsewhere, even a hostel would have been better!

The thermostat had a sign above it stating that it was NOT a thermostat but a switch. Turning it one way turned on hot air from a vent in the ceiling - the other way turned off air from the ceiling.

As other people have mentioned, once we'd checked in we were offered a lovely glass of champagne. My hubby was more in the mood for a cuppa so declined. We were seated in the bar area although the room was ready and I mentioned to the waitress about my hubby fancying a cup of tea so she kindly brought this and that was his welcome drink. We had a pleasant wait and relax for 10 minutes or so and then called to finish check-in and get our key. We had room 411 on the 4th floor. Seemed very satisfactory on first glance. I had had some trepidation about the double bed being small but was pleased to find it was massive! At least king and maybe queen-sized. Sofa in room, good wardrobe and massive sliding window. The bathroom was small but adequate. The bath was tiny! There was the usual telly with, for us, BBC world news and a couple of film channels. All spotlessly clean. As it happened, the location of the hotel turned out to be perfect for us, near but not on the Ramblas, and a Rock club just round the corner! Coming out of the hotel, doing a left and then another, the street - Carrer Tallers- which leads to the Ramblas has loads of alternative music and clothes shops and some bakeries. There is a tapas bar on the corner of the little street the Grupotel is on but we found 3 really good veggie restaurants not too far away from the hotel - the big Organic on Junta De Commerc, Juicy Jones on Carrer del Hospital (fab, vegan, and really cheap!) and Biocenter on Pintor Fortuny. Hotel is very close to the metro and the bus 'station' (all the buses sit round a massive square), where we were able to catch a cheap bus back to El prat airport (make sure you get the right bus for the right terminal!). So, location of hotel was brilliant we thought. We had breakfasts included in our deal and the breakfast spread did not disappoint! Everything possible to choose from in the way of food, a selection of fresh fruit juices, plus a rather impressive partitioned box containing a great selection of teas including green, red and mint! The only slight mishap in our stay was that the shower fitting was completely loose and one day the whole thing just fell off and the heavy shower head fell very painfully on my husband's toe. I let them know at reception and someone came to fix it sharpish the next day. The room was very well heated, could get too hot if you didn't have window open but wasn't a prob, we like window open at night so temp was perfect and I must say, medium firm mattress was perfect for me, pillows were perfect I wanted to take them, so I slept well throughout our stay. I'm a fussy so and so but would happily recommend this hotel.

The hotel is in a good location and is easy to find from the bus stop from the hotel at catalonia plaza. The room was a good size, the bathroom was a good size too, and the shower was nice and powerfull. we stayed on the 4th floor in a room at the front of the hotel with a balcony. The main downside I would say at this hotel was that the rooms were boiling hot, we had to sleep with the doors open all night which was ok most of the time, but they do empty the bins at night for some reason! this only lasts a few minutes though so not too bad. After coming back from an evening out we wanted to stop in the bar for a few drinks but soon found out that the bar closes at 11:30pm, the bar staff though were very friendly and asked if we wanted any more drinks before they closed and they were quite happy for us to buy another round or 2 and sit in the bar area. the hotel is a 2 minute walk to las ramblas and close tot he metro which makes getting around very easy, we bought a T-10 ticket which gives 10 single trips, there were 4 of us and we used the same card for all of us. We were slightly concerned as most people we spoke to warned us about pickpockets, we had no problems, as long as you keep your bag/wallet in front of you and dont flash any expensive items i dont think you have much to worry about - its just something to be aware of. A couple of our group wanted to go to a barcelona game whilst there and were surprised when the hotel offered us tickets - with good seats. they were slightly more expensive than getting them at the ground but it saved the hassle of going to the stadium to pick them up, and risking wether there were any left. Breakfast wasn't included in our room but we were given a 50% off voucher for one day, which we took advantage of.

Fortunately, we were so tired from all the walking we didn't get our sleep interrupted too much, except when guests arrived back from the clubs and were unable to talk quietly. The other big negative is the rock hard beds, which we've found before in Spanish Hotels. The hotel has been modernised and, though small, was pretty clean. The reception staff were excellent, well turned out, polite and helpful. We only ate in the restaurant for breakfast, which was continental buffet style, and was OK, with a wide range of hot and cold food & drink. Barcelona is a great city to visit - very easy to get about on public transport or the hop-on, hop-off tourist buses, loads to see and do (we didn't fit everything in over 5 days). There are some very good restaurants - we would recommend Las Quinze Nits in Placa del Reine off las Ramblas, TapaTapa in Port Vell, and the Hard Rock Cafe (Placa del Catalunya).

Our 'family' room had a double bed and sofa bed which had been made up into a bed. The bathroom had a full bath and shower over. The room was clean and tidy. The hotel has free wireless internet which is great, international TV channels and a trouser press in the room. The breakfast was 15 Euros per person, which seemed a bit pricey, but we were offered 50% discount vouchers for the 1st day which we used. It was the usual buffet style affair with cooked eggs, bacon, cereals, toast, croissants etc - oh and pizza if you fancy it! On the 2nd day we had breakfast in a nearby cafe, there are plenty around if you prefer not to pay the 15 Euros. The only negatives about the hotel was that it seemed rather noisy at night - with people banging & knocking on doors and generally making in noise (what is it with some people!?) Of course this isn't the hotel's fault. The plumbing also seemed to be quite noisy too, after having a shower and when others did the same - not a major problem though, and didn't really impact on our stay.

This hotel and all our other places we found were offering exactly what we needed. After traveling in 9 other cities in Spain, we wanted to drop our rental car to our last destination, Barcelona. Staying at Grupotel Gravina, we didn't need a car. We were close to the heart of the city, Plaza Catalunya and Las Remblas. We bought the Barcelona card before the trip, but didn't need to. In fact we could have bought it at the Tourist office in Plaza Catalunya, just walking distance from the hotel. Travelling in Barcelona is really easy with the metro and the bus. There are buses every 8 to 10 minutes weekdays. We travelled the city for 3 full days with our 10 year old son, going everywhere, without problem. When leaving for the airport we even took the train to the airport, included in Barcelona Card. The hotel was not luxurious, the room not that big, but it was clean, quiet, the staff was nice and there were 2 computers with free Internet access. They were fast too and supply a printer to print reservations. The PC was fast too. I was able to backup my 2000 photos on my usb key, much rapidly than at any Internet coffe all around the country. When arriving at the hotel there was a welcome sparkling wine. Plus we were given coupons for half price breakfast for the next morning. The breakfast was ok but not the best we had, compared to other hotels, and it was in a room without windows. So we decided the other days to go to McDonalds.

The general walkways were tidy, but a little shabby. To get to our room we had to take 2 very small lifts. My wife took the stairs sometimes to avoid them. Our room was very small and we had to pack our suitcase away to move around freely. Generally, the room was clean, although the bedding was basic. There were no dressing gowns and only 1 additional blanket. The bath was tiny. It could not fit even 1 small adult. The room TV was basic with poor signal reception and although the hotel was advertised with Wi-Fi available, it was impossible to use anywhere but the lobby. it is a shame the management of this hotel are driven to exploit the Barcelona conference calendar.

We had booked a standard room through hotels.com, but I think we god a petit room \u2013 it seems though (from the floor plan) that there are many rooms in this size. THE ROOM The room was very small, but sufficient for us. I recon it was about 4 by 3 meters, but there were enough space for our two suitcases. There was a small double bed, which was a bit hard but I think this is standard in Spain after haven stayed on several hotels and expirenced the same. The room had a minibar, a safe and a small flat screen TV with cable-tv (two English movie channels and CNN in English, which is quite good in Spain \u2013 normally there aren\u2019t any English channels to my expirence). Also there were a music speaker in the roof, quite nice to be able to listen to music without the TV on. The bathroom had a good size and was functional. LOCATION The location is great! It is located right in the center of Barcelona, if you as we do like to take a stroll thorugh the city you will find anything within walking distance. The rambla is just three minutes away with life 24h/day. If you anyway want to take the metro, it is 1 minute from Universitat station, and 3-5 minutes from Catalunya station with many connections). SERVICES The hotel offered a complimentary glass of Cava on check in, which was nice. Check-in and check-out was quick and without problems, and the staff was helpful in explaining about the city. We didn\u2019t have breakfast as this was 17 EUR \u2013 in the caf\u00e9s around you will get breakfast for 2-5 EUR. The free WI-FI is kind of a laugh. There is a network on every floor, and you are supposed to use the network on your floor. Often there was no internet connection on the network on our floor, and the only way forward was trial-and-error trying each floors WI-FI until we found a working connection. This is not very professional \u2013 I guess it is because there is no security activated on the networks so all kind of people in the area must be using the network. ALL-IN-ALL All-in-all we found the hotel to offer great value for money. We paied 75 EUR/night which was a very fair price compared to other hotels with a similar location.

Secondly, the hotel told my wife and I that it was impossible to give us more than 1 key (between the two of us) for the room. This is possibly the most ridiculous claim I have ever heard from a hotel \u2013 but they were adamant that they could not give us a second key. Thirdly, the hotel is arranged across two adjoining buildings: floors 1 and 2 in the first building and floors 3 and upwards in the other building. The adjoining building faces out on to a very busy main road and not the \u201cquiet side street\u201d that the first building is on. The road is busy not just with traffic but through much of the night, also busy with revellers, due to its proximity to Las Ramblas. Expect noise. On the plus side, the staff were friendly and helpful. (They also appeared to be genuinely apologetic about the shortcomings mentioned above.) Furthermore, the bed was comfortable and the breakfasts were excellent. Another nice touch was the free internet access provided by the hotel \u2013 WiFi was available throughout, or a couple of PCs in the lobby were dedicated to internet access.

The Port Vell area is easily reached by a pleasant stroll down The Ramblas, and you can find many nice restaurants, shopping and The Aquarium. The best way to see the city and its attractions is via the Bus Turistic. This service was on strike when we visited but was replaced by Barcelona Tours who did a marvellous job. There is so much to see and visit in this city that it is worth doing your homework before you travel. For instance, the location of the cable car that runs from Avenue Mirimar (Montjuic) over Port Vell to Barcelonetta is not greatly advertised, but is worth finding as the view is spectacular.

It was catered with a wardrobe with hangers inside, really good air conditioning, a room safe (which you need to buy a key for), a television, room bar, wooden flooring, desk and chair, marble bathroom with a shower and flowing hot water ready for use. If you need an iron, you can simply as reception. The location is very quiet, and is just a 4minute walk away from the Las Ramblas.

The Grupotel Gravina Hotel (not H10 any more) was a great 3 star hotel. The hotel is situated a three minute walk from Pl. Universitat and five minutes by foot to Pl.Catalunya at the top of the Rambla. The room included a minibar, a big bathroom compared to other European hotels, a kettle (although you had to buy your teabags or coffee at the hotel bar if you did not nick any at breakfast), and a wardrobe. We had a double bed that was a bit hard, but I slept very well. Our room was in the newer part of the hotel, Gravina II, but you had to walk a long way to get there. First into a lift, up two floors, turn right, up a small staircase, turn left, then right, another lift up two more floor and then to the right again. No problem for us, but not great if you are carrying a lot of baggage, a pushchair or whining children. The staff was very helpful. They spoke good English, recommended good restaurants (Celler Tapas one block up was a good choice) and the room was very clean. Breakfast also very good with a good variety of hot and cold food and cakes. Conclusion; A very good experience. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and colleagues. A tip: Always check all hotels official website for prices before booking on the net. (\u201cGoogle\u201d the name and you will most probably find it). How to get there from the Airport (copied from a mail the hotel sent me when I requested directions): The best three ways to arrive from the airport are: Taxi: It costs about 25 \u20ac. It takes 20-30 minutes. Bus: There is a special bus called Aerobus (blue bus with yellow writing on it). It leaves from the airport every 15 minutes. It costs 4 \u20ac per person. It is comfortable and fast (it will also take 20-30 minutes). You must stop in Gran Via - Pla\u00e7a Universitat (which is the third stop). The hotel is 150 meters from that point. (get of bus, walk down Pelai and turn right when you are opposite the Jazz Hotel) Last Bus is at 24hs. Train: There is a train that lives from the airport every 15 minutes. It costs around 2,5 \u20acuros per person. It takes around 25 minutes. You must stop in Catalunya; the Hotel is 5 minutes walking from Catalunya Square. Last train lives around 23.40hs.", "Date": "February 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Etobicoke, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cCharm and Character, with a classy lobby\u201d", "Author": "rro", "ReviewID": "UR6803450", "Content": "When I arrived at this hotel, I thought it was quite elegant.

We'd recommend a visit to the Sagrada Familia and the Magic Fountain - they were amongst the highlights of our trip. Also Pi square was pretty cool and a great place to chill out. Avoid - the Port Olimpic area for food, unless you want to get chaved up and watch Brits abroad! This wasn't our taste, as was the paella down there!

Removing the bedspreads and blankets also makes sleeping more comfortable. There is air conditioning but in the height of summer do not expect artic temperatures. Spend a whole day at the Montserrat Monastery. Public transport is clean, efficient, and cheap. We saw no evidence of the reported crime, but with as with all major cities take precautions. There are some great, mediocre, and terrible restaurants. We had three great dinners at the El Rey De La Gamba fish restaurant on the Olympic Marina front. It would have been four but they close on Mondays. That night we had the misfortune of experiencing our only truly terrible meal of the trip. We had returned very tired from Montserrat and ignored our rule of never using restaurants that use sales people to drum up business. Visit the food market half way along the Rambala.
