Also, the Wi-Fi Internet connection was not working in our building then. We had to use the one at the reception area. And the hotel being fully occupied, there is usually a wait to use the shared toilet in the morning. We stayed for 3 days and explored the main island only.

It's a great location, 10 mins from the train station and Piazzale Roma (bus station), and 5 mins walk from campo Santa Margherita which is one of my favourite squares in Venice, with its many bars and restaurants (and there's a supermarket there too). It's a slightly less touristy area of the city and quite studenty as it's close to the university. We had a room with a shared bathroom as it was cheaper and we were travelling on a budget. I think this is one of the best budget hotels I've stayed in! We stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of September, 83 euro per night for a double room, which is very good value for Venice. Bear in mind that Venice accommodation is expensive so budget in Venice may be more than you might expect elsewhere. We asked for a room with a canal view, and we got it - the room was in the adjacent building next to the hotel, with 3 windows that looked out onto the canal, every day gondolas would go past and we'd get seranaded by gondoliers singing traditional songs. The room was basic but huge, with a table and chairs, handbasin, and a shower; the shared toilet was right next to our room, and always clean. I found it a bit weird as the shower cubicle in our room was right in the middle of the room (!) but as a couple it was fine and it was nice to have a shower in our room - in any case there was a shower in the shared bathroom too. The only bad point was that as the rooms are quite close together and the doors thin, sometimes you can hear other people in the corridor and closing doors, but on the whole I didn't find noise to be a problem. The breakfasts at the hotel were good value as breakfast was included in the room rate, we had tea/coffee, orange juice, and each table is given a basket of bread, pastries and croissants, which was plenty. Staff were very helpful and we could leave our bags at the hotel after check out as our train didn't leave until the evening.

It took us 10 mins with luggage to find the hotel from the bus stop. We got a little mixed up on the way, but accidentally stumbled upon it anyway. Here's how to get there from the bus station (Piazzale Roma): facing east (towards most of Venice), take the walkway in the middle. (You can see a large bridge to your left - don't take that one.) After passing by a few stalls/carts selling souvenirs and food, go over a medium-sized bridge with stairs (there are a lot of these in Venice). After the bridge, continue straight ahead; the sidewalk will curve to the left, and there will be a rose garden to your right and a park to your left. Continue straight over the first bridge over the canal you come to, and you will see the Sofitel hotel to your left. Turn right, and then follow the sidewalk when it turns to the left (don't cross again). After a few hundred feet, you'll see the sign for Hotel Dalla Mora pointing down a small side street. We booked a double room with ensuite bathroom. At the hotel, we met a kind gentleman who spoke good English. We were early (it was around 11 am) and he offered to have the room cleaned and ready in 10 mins! The room was a great surprise. We climbed up 2 flights (he offered to help with luggage but we were ok). The room was large. A big double bed with thin closets on either side. Across from the bed was a large closet containing a double murphy bed. The floor was clean wood and there were many windows facing the canal. The bathroom was small but clean and adequate. The shower only had enough room to stand. A large person might have trouble moving around because it's so small. We didn't see any air conditioning but it was generally cool during our stay. Later in the summer it might be a problem. Having to have windows open means some noise at around 7 AM as the boats come in with merchandise. There was also some construction across the street. Not a problem for us as we woke up early anyways. Breakfast was nice--we got a small carafe of hot coffee and a small carafe of hot milk (you could also get tea). There was also orange juice. Everyone got a basket with 2 croissants and 4 rolls per couple. There was an assortment of jams/jellies/nutella. Also some packaged cookies and toast. I personally missed water but I didn't ask so maybe they could have provided it. I also noted that skim milk is hard to find in Italy. I've gotten so used to skim milk in the US that whole milk tastes weird now. All in all, a great stay on a budget. Clearly, if you can spend more, it would be nice to stay on the grand canal. This hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to a vaporetto stop which was fine for us but may not be the best for everyone. People have mentioned smells in the room, which we did not notice. There were many different smells in Venice itself, one second you'd get a whiff of a tasty meal, the next second a whiff of garbage/sewage and maybe the third a smoker would blow a whiff in your face. Luckily, the breeze is nice, and within the next minute you'd be smelling something good again. A tip for people staying here: for going in the direction of San Marco or the Accademia, it's usually faster to walk west to the San Toma' vaporetto stop, but it is very easy to get lost coming from San Toma'. To get to San Toma', turn right out of the hotel and then right on the larger street (I think it's called Calizada San Pantalon). Take it to the end and turn left - you'll go through a very narrow street and end up at a small canal with a little red fire hydrant at the end. There is a bridge a block to your right; go right and then over the bridge. Then turn right where there is a sign \"Al Vaporetto\" and you'll end up at San Toma'. One last thing: they had a laptop in the lobby that was free for guests to use, which was nice. They also had free wifi, but the signal was fairly weak and it did not make it to the second floor. It's possible that rooms on the first floor would have signal, but we had to go down to the lobby. Also, when we came back around midnight on a Friday night and wanted to look up our train arrangements, the laptop was gone and the staff said that not only was the laptop not available but the wifi was also \"closed.\" He did not explain why.

Just 5 minutes walk from Piazzale Roma where we dropped off our rental car, the hotel sits in a very quiet area with few tourists compared to the areas around San Marco Square. The walk and water bus ride to San Marco are both lovely. The first few times we tried to navigate the narrow streets and canal bridges to find San Marco Square we got lost, but that was half the fun. Our favorite piazza was close to the hotel - Campo San Magherita. This was a popular hangout for the locals, especially the younger crowd and there are many cafes that line the square. Our favorite was Pier Dickens Inn - fantastic pizza and pasta at very reasonable prices and a free glass of Persecco (Italian sparkling wine) to start your meal.

Hotel Dalla Mora is nothing flash but it is comfortable and welcoming, convenient to the train station, and our room overlooked a major gondola route. For 100 euro a night we felt like we had million-dollar views. With the windows open we could lay and listen to the bells pealing or sit and enjoy the gondoliers singing as they passed by. The balcony was right next to our room and one evening we enjoyed a lovely dinner of pizza and red wine as the sun set. Booking directly via email was hassle-free.

Although its just a 1 star hotel and the picture shown on the net doesn't looks impressive but its far more better than you think. The hotel is just a 10 minutes walk from train station and we have no problem of locating it. Its of a small alley thats make it very quiet at night. We were placed at the annex just exactly opposite the main building and were given 2 keys, 1 for the main entrance and the other for the room thats make us feel very safe as only the hotel guest have the access to the hotel. Our room comes with a sink which is very handly and the bathroom is just outside the room. This is my first experience of shared bathroom and i was quite sceptical about it but it have change now. The bathroom is very clean and well maintained and although the hotel was fully booked, we have no problem at all using the bathroom. Tha same goes to the room, its clean, tidy and of course , canal view. Its an enjoyment siiting next to the window with a beer overooking the canal. The breakfast is one the best we have in our trip to italy this time. Its consist of freshly brewed coffee, a basket of breads and on buffet table comes with cheese, jams, biscuits and orange juice. Just outside the breakfast room, there is a small lobby area with some latest travelling guidebook thats allowed you to have some reading while having breakfast. This is our first trip to venice and together with this hotel have make our trip here very memorable. The only negative point is dalla mora is quite far from St. mark square, its about 30 minutes walk but even that is an experience. Walking thru the alleys is one of \"the must\" in venice .

We sat outside one afternoon and took in the views. This also seemed to be a bit of a meeting point with some of the other guests. The staff were quite nice and provided us with directions to a nearby laundry which was very friendly. We were able to walk to St Mark's Square without getting too lost from the hotel.

Our room was four walls with a shower stall\"stuck\" installed between the windows, not visually pleasing, but functional. Just outside the door was a shared bathroom with another shower and a toilet. We were busy enjoying Venice, so we were in the room very little and had no prob with the arrangement. From the train station, if you do it right, you will only cross over 1 bridge with your luggage. You'll also go up and down the steps of another bridge, but won't cross it. Great location. It's in an area that we would not have explored otherwise, not too touristy, near the Friari Church. It is about 15 minutes to Rialto, but we rarely made it straight there without stopping for pics, pastry's or coffee along the way. It's about the same distance to the Accademia Bridge.
