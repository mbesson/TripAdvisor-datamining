I stayed in and have breakfast each day and found the serving team isnt as professional as the front desk. Like they ran out of milk or butter at the buffet table without refill for 2 days out of 3 days that we stayed..the breakfast food isnt hot neither warm at 9am when we had it..which is a little bit disappointed. and we could find no one to assist sometimes at the breakfast section. Wish they could make sure there is enough manpower to serve us next time if we visit again.

We arrived at around 7am due to an overnight flight and decided to see if we could leave our bags at the hotel whilst we waited until we could check in. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful - they checked us in immediately and gave us the room free of charge for that day. They also upgraded us to the next sized room. The entire hotel is absolutely beautiful and very clean. It is situated in the 'old' Singapore area Kampong Glam, which is just off North Bridge Road. Easy to walk places and we could get almost anywhere we wanted by taxi for under S$20. This area also comes alive after dark with heaps of bars and restaurants. We had breakfast included with our room rate. It was a very simple buffet breakfast with choices of cereal or museli and fruit or toast/hash browns/baked beans/scrambled eggs/sausages for hot breakfast. Not elaborate, but it did the trick. As others have mentioned, the hot water did not last very long, but with the humid climate in Singapore, even I found the lack of hot water was not an issue. We enjoyed the room design, however I guess the low bed is not for everyone, however it does describe the different rooms on the website, so there was no surprise that this was the design of the room. I had expected computers, however there was free wifi on the ground floor. There is a 24 hour cyber cafe right around the corner if you need to use a computer very cheaply.

I was pleasantly surprised upon arrival at this charming boutique hotel to find a small boutique hotel with minimalist design, great service, mid-size rooms and modern in-room amenities. Clean and well kept. Bed linen is of good quality and there is ample closet space. Rooms come with a coffee machine and an ipod docking station. Eventhough wifi is not included in the rooms, i managed to connect as the signal was pretty strong from the 1st Floor! Bar upstairs has a nice vibe/ambience and music is not too loud. A bit strange having to walk past the outdoor bar area to get to your room though! Especially on a Friday night! Room areas are restricted with automated metal gates ensuring privacy and security. Location is a bit far from Bugis MRT station and a few blocks from Arab Street and Haji Lane, but worth the hassle to walk.

We booked one of the atticrooms via their own website, only to find out upon arrival, all atticrooms were fully booked and we received a free upgrade to one of their Sultanrooms. After being taken to this room, we were very dissapointed, Despite the higher roomrate, the Sultanrooms are very small and have a \" suffocating\" feel to them. We did not feel comfortable staying in one of these rooms, even just for 1 night. So we turned back to reception to ask for another room, prefering, the attic room, as chosen by us in the first place. There was a new reception staffmember, being on one of his first days, who was very helpful and smiling all the time, making us feel very welcome and giving us the idea that asking for a different room was no problem what so ever, which was nice. The guy, telling him what to do, however, did not seem very content with his job and gave us the impression he was very tired and not happy to provide us with another room. Going up in the elevator to our atticroom (which somehow was available after all??), he even rested his head against the wall, making me ask him if he was upset with us and making us feel really awkward. Fortunately, the new guy did continue to stay calm and friendly (despite of the rude behaviour of his co-worker). During our wait for a clean atticroom, we enjoyed a drink at the Sultan bar (unfortunately not complimentary), where they play Buddhabar loungemusic and you can enjoy a very pretty surrounding (loungetents with cushions, nice lamps, wooden flooring etc.) The atticrooms are very pretty and atmospheric. They provide bathrobes, a brandnew espresso machine, a lovely rainshower and the most wonderful fluffy/soft towels ever. Also the mattress on the platform bed is wonderful, as are the pillows. This was the first room in Asia where we found an ironing board and iron in the dresser. The white wooden decorated room divider, wooden beams on the ceiling and Arabic rug, give the room a homely feeling. You definitely have a good night of sleep in this hotel! Breakfast is provided in the lobby area, until 11.00 (nice!!). There's a set menu with a choice of eggs&bread, yoghurt&cereal or a salmon/egg sandwich plus coffe/tea and orangejuice. I ordered cereal, but received oatmeal in a bowl of milk instead. My boyfriend ordered the salmon/egg sandwich, only to be served a chicken and egg sandwich, without telling him. After one bite, he found out to be eating chicken instead of salmon, so he asked the staff what went wrong here. They told him they were out of salmon, so they decided to give him chicken instead, without consulting him first. This was not very considerate, I believe (I was lucky they did not do this to me, since I do not eat meat). We had to ask for our juices, which arrived after about 10 minutes. In the end, we left without enjoying our breakfast and went for a bite outside. Another very positive thing about the Sultan (besides the gorgeous atticrooms), is the showerroom, they provide before you take off for the airport. This enabled us to enjoy a full day in the various neighbourhoods of Singapore, without needing to bother about where to change into travellingclothes later on in the early evening. All in all, yes, the rooms are not very big, so I would not stay for 3 nights, but who does when in Singapore??? For a maximum of 2 nights, it's a wonderful place to spend your Singapore nights and I would reccomend booking the atticroom instead of the Sultanrooms, because of the atmospere and space. If your looking for lots of space, you maybe better book one of their suites (this will cost you an extra 90, 130 or 160 Singapore dollars). Besides this, the Arabic area around the corner, provides you with a lot of eateries with delicious mezes, so the area is also very nice! I would book here, before they are mentioned in Lonely PLanet, which I am sure they will be in the future.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, uk", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money for Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Shelley L", "ReviewID": "UR125241953", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights and were very lucky to receive a double upgrade free of charge.

Whooshing noise of aircon over head, moved room. Accepted a very small room 119 overlooking courtyard on understanding it was a quiet room at 4.30pm. Gary told us window opened for light, but it was covered by fixed curtain, didn't explain other windows did not open. No luggage rack. Didn't notice that door to wardrobe was actually a connecting door to next room. 6pm mentioned this to Gary on reception who said he would try to see no one in next room. Also told him air con leaked and nearly broke my neck as I slipped on it exiting bathroom. No mirror in bedroom, no electric in bathroom could not see to dry hair, No iron or ironing board, no wardrobe, cupboard with hanging space for two shirts! Still got the coffee machine and flat screen though! Show Gary room who suggests that room not big enough for ironing board and why don't I send out my ironing. At 9pm notice light on under connecting door and of course at midnight gone a man enters room turns on his tv loudly and proceeds to have a shower. Tell night manager I am checking out next day, eventually she says no stay, I will find you a quiet room for tomorrow Next morning we dress and go to breakfast without shower or waking man in next room who is still loudly snoring at 10am!!!

After breakfast 11.30am receptionist shows us room 320 which is larger, quieter and has wardrobe . Say we will take it then Gary after all our problems asks us for an extra 100 dollars ++ . ++ means plus service charge and tax! I would have stayed if they would have let the room to us at our rate of 200 dollars plus plus but not prepared to have such awful service and pay extra for the priviledge. Room 119 is the disabled room, bathroom fittings but you cannot access the bathroom with a wheelchair. There is only about 12 inches between the bed and the door and you cannot move the bed. Badly trained staff who are inexperienced. Mostly hotel is clean but ladies in public area on ground floor is filthy, look at fingerprints all over door. Whilst we were at breakfast inspite of a do not disturb sign on our door, our bedroom was entered.

No internet, no hot water, noisy.\u201d", "Author": "lifeisbeaut", "ReviewID": "UR124141198", "Content": "We often like to stay in boutique hotels that have some character. This place is a nice building from the outside but that's all that is going for it. The location is OK but not great for Singapore as 15 minutes walk to metro. We stayed in the attic room which is really not good for the price paid - there are no windows in the room, so it feels claustrophobic. The noise insulation is terrible - we stayed two nights and it was noisy both nights from music etc. The facilities in the room are poor - there are no mirrors in the room, only the bathroom, no bin in the bathroom. The towels are poor quality. Although one is given water bottles on first night, they do not replenish it on the second day. Same with the tea, not replenished. The worst part was there was no hot water - there is a switch we kept on all night but hot water lasted for about one minute - and we tried four times. The hotel advertises itself as boutique but has all the luxuries - I don't know how they can say this when there is no hot water for more than a minute. We booked it at a time before other reviews were written and now notice many people are saying the same thing. The lift going to the room was terrible - it was a dodgy lift, light fittings not finished, no proper doors etc. We didn't really like getting the lift so thought we would use the stairs - the stairs from room go straight down to the outside back door which is a fire exit - we went down only to find the exit was blocked with chairs etc so one could not get out the door - this is a fire hazard!! On the day we were leaving the lift had a sign saying it is having minor upgrades being done but it was 4am in the morning! On questioning further we were advised that the lift had broken down so we rang someone to get our luggage as we didn't want to carry it down the stairs. They turned up with a lady wearing high heels which is totally inappropriate for them to be able to carry bags anywhere down stairs. The breakfast was terrible, the service was terrible. Additionally it advertises free internet. Our room apparently had LAN connected internet, no wi fi which is not exactly hi tech. It didn't work on the first night so we rang to ask, they said it was down and being repaired. They rang back at 10pm to say it was fixed but we did not check that night. We checked the next morning it did not work, we told reception, they said they thought it worked and would look into it and let us know, they never came back to us. The second evening we tried again, it didn't work, when we rang they said it should work, but it didn't!! Another example is the bathroom - they have one soap only for shower and sink. Additionally there was a hole in the wall for where the toilet paper roll should be. Seriously, this place is not boutique. We payed less money to stay at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Marina Bay a week earlier which far surpassed this. For the price they are charging this place is a joke.
