We stayed 5 nights in a premier grand studio. The first morning we had housekeeping staff moving trolleys and talking loudly outside our room at 7.00am. At 9.00am we had housekeeping trying to get in to service the room! The balcony area was covered in dirt and grime. The heavy glass sliding doors to close off the bedroom from the living area were almost unmovable and after 3 reports to reception a maintenance man came on the third day. He said that one of the doors was \"dangerous\" and could fall if moved because of missing parts in the ceiling runner. The uneven floor level betweeen the passage and bathroom meant a \"step up\"to avoid tripping and falling. Plenty of dirt and dust clearly visible on either side of the washing machine and the glass topped tables all had permanent looking cup and glass bottom stains on them. We realized after leaving that we had been hit with a credit card surchage. No warning and no mention by the receptionist. To top it off we asked reception if they had contact with an airport shuttle bus company. Yes, they do the bookings. He was at least 15 minutes earlier than the agreed time and not happy we were not standing out the front. The small 8 seater was at least 20 years old, had no seat belts, and looked a bomb. The driver drove like an absolute maniac out to the airport frightening everyone onboard including a couple with a baby. Medina need to use another shuttle service urgently.

We arrived at the hotel a little early, around 1.30pm, though we were still able to check in at this time, which was appreciated. Check in was quick, although the girl who checked us in was a little stand-offish and did not look very happy to be at work. Our room was on the 8th floor which we very happy with considering the cheap rate we booked the room with through Wotif. We had a view of the city and the Aquarium, and a balcony, though we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend any time out here during our stay due to the poor weather. Our studio room was small but this suited us fine, as we were only staying for one night anyway. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice and spacious. One thing that put me off a little was that the toiletries provided by the hotel (shampoo, body gel etc) were half empty, meaning they had probably not been replaced from earlier guests by the housekeeping staff. We slept well despite being located right next to the busy main road; the double glazing works well to ensure guests a good night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep. The location of the hotel is excellent; just a few minutes to Darling Harbour, and about 15-20 minutes into the CBD/Circular Quay. The City is very well set out and we found it quite easy to navigate with a very basic map. We did not eat at the Hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant nor did we use the pool, so I cannot comment on those facilities. One more thing worth mentioning is the lifts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they were very quick and arrived almost immediately everytime we used them.

The apartment block is not on the actual harbour, it is surrounded by another apartment block and the aquarium. For me it was worth paying the extra money for the premier apartment as I wanted to be on a high floor. The apartment was very spacious. The bathroom was large and had a bath with a very powerful over-bath shower. The bathroom also housed the washing machine and tumble dryer in a cupboard. This was a fantastic addition to the apartment and was free to use (washing powder was available for a small charge). The sofa and chair had some stains, ie probably ready to be replaced or cleaned.

On checking in we asked for directions to the place we were meeting friends on King Street Wharf for dinner and the woman at reception didn't seem to be familiar at all with what was available on King Street Wharf.

I'd read there was a convenience store and bottle shop nearby so asked for directions to these - they're literally next door to one exit from the hotel which is very handy. There are heaps of bars & restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel, but as it was pouring with rain & cold during my stay, I decided to make use of the kitchen in my studio room. The studio room was great and had heaps of space, plus flat sceen TV in the lounge room & bedroom, oven, hotplates, full size fridge & microwave in the kitchen, balcony overlooking Wildlife World, and a good size bathroom with a shower over the bath & washing machine & dryer tucked away in a cupboard. It was also very clean and in good condition. The bedroom's separated by Japanese style sliding screens which use the space quite cleverly, and although it wasn't the comfiest bed in the world, it wasn't too bad and I had no noise issues. Overall I thought the hotel was very good value for money and I'll definitely stay there again.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWhat a let down\u201d", "Author": "HolsandG", "ReviewID": "UR115684073", "Content": "My partner and I were really excited about this stay but were sadly let down.

In this case however the Medina was actually not a bad choice. We were attending a conference at the nearby conference center. Its about a 10min walk away, there are closer hotels than this, but its a pretty easy walk . The hotel itself is pretty nice, my room, was very quiet despite being close to a busy road, but there was no noise to speak of, the room itself was reasonable size, had a little kitchen type thing , and a desk area and table and chairs. It was more than enough for 1, The bathroom was nice and the shower was Great! - it had one of those roof mounted nozzles and the pressure was exceptional and hot . Very much enjoyed that. A couple of small improvements that could have been made 1) the safe was totally dead, first time I had encountered that 2) The tv, is a little small for the size of the room, and distance from the bed, a bit bigger would have been a lot easier to watch . The internet is ok, but its a ripoff price, $12 an hour, $25 a day or 60 for 3 - I cant really see the justification for that apart from profiteering, it also makes it clear you cant have more than 1 device per payment - which sucks - its 2011 !! People have multiple devices - I had a IPHONE an IPAD and LAPTOP, if im going to have to pay what is top dollar, restricting me to 1 device is very annoying. The magnetic swipe cards are a pain to , mostly in the lifts, they make you swipe to get to your floor - but very annoying, if you get it with someone on say level 5, and your on level 4 - he swipes first and if the elevator moves, it wont let you swipe your card, it just flashes, so you get a ride with him, then you have to stop , swipe again before someone else calls the lift otherwise you get another ride - happened to a couple of us a few times. I didnt have a lot of chance to interact with the staff - however one morning I left the do not disturb sign on the door, and went for the day, it was actually a mistake, but my mistake. What was nice, was the fact that they didn't go in, but did leave a bag of towels at the door, a nice and helpful touch, something I cant remember happening before - So thats pretty good. The other thing was the Fire Alarm sounded at 6am, which is a bit of a pain, thankfully using the speaker system they didnt make you go out onto the road, like other places I have stayed where they make you jump out of bed, go down the stairs in the cold and stand in the road. , they actually just asked you to stay in their rooms and then let everyone know about 5 mins later it was a false alarm.

My partner ordered the Battered Fish & Chips & I ordered Spaghetti Bolognaise. The battered fish & chips were obviously straight out of the supermarket freezer, no flavour, terrible. The Spaghetti Bolognaise was terrible no sauce in it, no garlic, where was the cheese, again another frozen meal straight from the supermarket freezer. I had to ask for some parmesan cheese and sauce to give it a bit of ooomph, but nothing would improve the terrible flavour and it had no texture, actually it had nothing at all. What a disgrace, we were so disgusted that these frozen meal dishes could be served in a so called cafe/restaurant in Darling Harbour.

Good location, 1 bedroom apartment setup, 4 star rating. Some very strange things though to make you aware of. The only rooms they had available for us were wheelchair accessible (apparently as they were replacing carpets on one floor during our stay). While it's commendable to have such rooms available, they weren't actually built that well for those confined to wheelchairs or otherwise. The first issues were with the kitchen setup (really low cabinets making the cabinet and sink very awkward when cooking and very limited counter space), and the bathroom (very high toilet, to the point my wife's feet wouldn't touch the floor - she's 5'6\", not terribly short). The first bathroom we got also didn't have any lip in the shower, which resulted in the coating the bathroom with a couple inches of water unless you built a dam with towels (unfortunately also no extra towels available so this wasn't effective). The bed we had the first night (before switching rooms) was the absolute worst I've ever slept in at a hotel. Mattresses were soft, as were the boxsprings. They weren't really boxsprings, just pieces of foam that sat just above the floor. The mattress must have been really old and worn out, there was no support whatsoever. We switched rooms on the second day and the bed went from terrible to barely adequate. The fridge in the room went from having cracked shelves in the first room that wouldn't support any weight, to having a door that wouldn't close, so we'd wake up to water on the floor every morning, and our food would be covered with water from the condensation. On the positive the service was excellent. Felt like a case where the hotel owners were nickel and diming on materials and the management was working with what they had, but didn't have capability to replace/repair things that needed upgrade (beds) or repairs (fridges).

One problem was that Ben at check-in did not explain why he held onto $1,900.00 on my credit card, when my total bill was under $1,500.00. This made me angry as I understand $100 fee but $400 left me without $300 of my own money towards spending. This is my ONLY complaint. However after talking to a very helpfull lady on the desk named Charlotte, she manage to fix my request. She was outstanding & a credit to the hotel. After a lot of searching reviews online I chose this hotel as I just didnt want to spill straight onto the city street with noise, cars, smoking etc. The hotel is city side of Darling Harbour so no long trek just to cross the bridge to the city. The views were awsome of Darling Harbour & due to being in Shelley St, which vitually had no traffic our cab could always pull up outside with no drama. The rooms / studios were great very clean, spacious and with a balcony I could open to for fresh air, instead of aircon which affects my sinus. They had a kitchenette with large fridge and microwave. The bathroom was lovely and had a washing machine & dryer (very handy). As well as a TV in the lounge there was a TV in the bedroom. This hotel offers excellent value for money along with a fantastic location. Next block down is a 24 hour 7/11 store And literally 1 minute to cross the street & you hit a row of resturants, cafes & bars at King St Wharf. Also the ferry connection to Circular Quay. Walk the other direction & 1 minute later you have hit the Wildlife & Aquarium worlds not to mention more resturants & bars. Five minutes walk & we have hit Sydney Imax. Keep walking & in 5 more minutes more resturants along with shopping centre joining the other hotels opposite side of Darling Harbour. Keep walking south 5 minutes & you hit the Chinese Gardens then Paddys Markets. All without having to cross busy streets with traffic & I felt very safe walking the whole Darling Harbour precinct. Again excellent value for money and excellent location.

Our room was upgraded from a studio to an apartment free of charge and it was a welcomed suprise and probably made our stay much more enjoyable. The room was lovely, very spacious and modern and we could have happily spent more time here. The hotel positioning doesnt really give amazing views, but you can get some views of darling harbour. For location the hotel is good, it is located right in the hub of darling harbour, literally next door to the aquarium, so there is plenty of choice for dining and evening enterntainment close by. Its a little bit out from some of the other city attractions, but if you dont mind a stroll or using the transport system in Sydney then its a great base for a stay. There is a monorail station next to the Aquarium. The pool at the hotel was small but nice, we didnt really get to use it due to bad weather, but it looked nice. As a few other reviews have mentioned, we also had curdled milk in our fridge, which when mentioned to the staff, they werent very apologetic. The staff slighlty let this hotel down.

The bed had a very thin doona which made it chilly over night as the weather was bad, and when I went to use the iron, I found it had exposed wires and the base of the iron was badly damaged and unusable. My other complaint was that the main living area of the apartment only had net curtains, and faced the street whereby people could look in.

We were caught up in the flight disruption due to the Icelandic volacano so had to stay another 10 nights, we were equally delighted with all aspects of the Grand Harbourside. My advice would be to go for a premier view as some of the apartments are at the back overlooking the road and some on the side overlooking the aquarium. We were on the fifth floor with a large balcony that caught the sun and great views overlooking Darling Harbour. Yes, it is next to Cargo bar and nightclub and Friday and Saturday nights do get a bit mucky but the sound proofing is great and when the windows were closed we hardly heard a sound. The apartments are well furnished with balcony tables and chairs, dining table with 4 chairs, sofa and arm cair etc. Bathroom is fine and the kitchen facilities in the one bedroom apartment more than adequate for cooking in or just snacking and using the many restaurants in the vicinity. I couldn't fault the staff, they were attentive, polite and friendly so I am not sure about some of the other reviewers' comments - we had no complaints at all. We could have our room serviced every day if we wanted or for more privacy, just put out the rubbish and wet towels for them to be replaced. The best of both worlds and it was always service with a smile. The location is very good, you literally walk onto Darling Harbour with a whole array of bars and restuarants and the ferry stop is next to the hotel. It is a 5 minute walk into the centee of Sydney and all in all the Grand Habourside has lots going for it. On our first night return to Sydney we stayed at another central apartment but we couldn't wait to get back to the Grand Harbourside and as soon as they had a room available we moved straight back to the original apartment we had on our first visit. The restaurant Lime is part of the hotel and serves drinks and light meals and these can be charged to the room account. The fitness suite looked OK but I didn't use it and the swimming pool, despite being small was always clean and had a grassy area for sunbathing. We were fortunate to catch the Anzac Parade on the Sunday and it was most impressive and showed the pride Australia has in its armed forces. I lasted 3 hours and was meticulously managed - Australia can show Britain a thing or two about pride, national identity and respect for its armed services! There are lots of restaurants to choose from, our favourite was Zaffran which is the other side of Darling Harbour, about a 10 minute walk. Modern Indian cuisine which was stunning, particularly sat on the balcony. The attitude of 'The Malaya', almost next door to the apartments, highly rated for food was not good and after confronting a haughty manageress we walked out before ordering and went next door to Kobe Jones, an upmarket Japanese which was great. For cheap and cheerful there is Wagamama next to the apartments which serves good food in a fairly basic setting but it doesn't break the bank. Hurricane's, also the other side of Darling Harbour serves ribs etc. Food was OK but not spectacular for the price. If you want a drink and pub style steak, Cargo is literally 15 seconds from the apartments but best used lunchtime or early evening in the week - avoid at weekend evenings. Also just along the wharf is Bungalow 8, again very busy at week-ends but pleasant for a drink but the food wasn't that good. Probaby the best deal we found was at 'The Argyle' in The Rocks, just abouve Circular Quay. On a Tuesday you have 2 steak and chips for 16 dollars - this was fillet steak and a really good meal and all it cost was about \u00c2\u00a35 a person- well worth a visit on a Tuesday (served all day). If you want fish and chips get a bus out to Balmoral Beach where the take away serves the freshest fish and chips, we preferred it to the fish market where we had lunch one day. You can sit on a bench to eat it overlooknig a stunning beach - fabulous! All in all, despite the frustration of being stuck in Sydney because of cancellel flights, staying at the Grand Harbourside made up for it and ensured that our extended stay was as painless as possible. When we return to Sydney later in the year we will be heading for the Grand Harbourside in hopefully the same apartment.

The apartment allocated to us was on the first floor, which was a bit disappointing view-wise, but was sufficiently insulated from road noise through double glazed windows. We had a bit of a water view and didn't spend much time in the apartment anyway. The apartment had a balcony, lounge, kitchen and dining, with separate bathroom and bedroom. We requested, and were granted, two single beds (I love my sister, but I'm not going to share a bed with her!) which were not plush, but not uncomfortable either. The pool and surrounds were nice for the location - you don't often get outdoor pools in the city. Towels were plentiful but the shower room adjoining the pool area could have done with some toiletries. I paid $230, which was OK value for money. If breakfast had been chucked in, I would have felt better about the cost. If you want to be close to Darling Harbour and King St wharf, I would recommend this hotel. For Circular Quay and shopping, I would recommend something located further toward the centre of the city. Oh, and parking will cost you an additional $30 per night.

On arrival the check in staff appeared to be very efficient, attentive and used initiative, suggesting he should enable our room key cards access to the different floors on which our entire group would be staying. Unfortunately we had to return to reception numerous times throughout our stay, as access to the different levels and even access to our rooms was never consistent. There appears to be a huge lack communication between staff. Our freezer wasn't working on arrival, which was essential in order to provide ice cubes to cool our baby milk. I called down to reception twice before they finally came to fix it. 2 days later, a porter came to the room to ask 'if our freezer was working yet?' The television in our 'living room' would not even turn on, and we only had the 'old' remote control. A member of staff came to the room and said 'i don't know how to work these things either' and promised to pass the message onto the day staff. The next night we called reception again enquiring after a working television, having been out all day, and another member of staff arrived to announce 'these tvs are new, we haven't been trained' Our 'pedal bin' in the bathroom had a broken pedal, which normally wouldn't be in issue however, we have a small baby, and hence had to throw away alot of nappies, and found it inconvenient and unhygienic to have to keep lifting the lid of the bin by hand. (it was a very small bin, so also hard to reach esp when holding a baby!) On reporting this to reception, they promptly asked housekeeping to remove the bin, and a porter returned some hours later to replace it...with a light bulb?? (I still don't understand the logic behind that?) We never did get a replacement, and had to make do with a carrier bag we put out ourselves each day. We also had to be very careful with what was left out on the kitchenette top, as our microwavable steriliser bag for baby bottles, which were clearly labelled (by Lindam) was thrown away by housekeeping. Luckily our last bag was safely left in our suitcase! The room itself was spacious enough, however the decor was very 'tired' looking. Faux fur seats were worn right down to the lining, sofas almost threadbare. The only new thing, the tv, wasn't even functional. The location was very useful, a stones throw away from Darling Park monorail should u need to use it, and just a few blocks from chinatown, which is an easy walk even with a baby. It is also right next to the harbour, and the aquarium. They advertise 'a fitness gym, sauna and heated pool'. The fitness gym comprises of very dated one exercise bike, cross trainer and some free weights. The pool is slightly heated, barely noticeable, and cleanliness is questionable. (leaves in the pool and the water was salty) The sauna barely heated up at all. Again access was variable, as was exiting! Liked best: Location Liked least: Poor service and decor.

They are no security chains/privacy locks on the door either to prevent this kind of thing happening. In addition, room service seems a bit over zealous. If you put the do not disturb sign on the door, they call you to ask if you need anything.

As a wheelchair user I did not wish to fight my way through the crowds from any other area of Sydney. I will concentrate on disabled friendly aspects of the property in this review. There is good ramped disabled access at the front of the hotel. The only apartment type available with a walk-in shower is the standard 1-bed apartment. This must be booked specifically as an Easy Access Room to be certain of such a shower. This cannot be done on the hotel website, the property needs to be contacted directly via email or phone. An Easy Access Room means this is a fully adapted disabled room. It is also means it is situated on the motorway side of the hotel. It is not possible to reserve such a room with a Darling Harbour View. I did not need a fully adapted room, only a walk-in shower, but there are no other choices here. I do not usually reserve adapted \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisabled\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rooms as they are generally in the least favourable area of a hotel and I prefer a good view. Many hotels in Sydney do not have any walk-in showers at all. As this is an adapted \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisabled\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room, the shower is a level roll in area with one glass wall and a curtain rather than a door. It has an integral shower seat and grab railings around the walls, with a floor to ceiling pole also. The floor is non-slip tiling. We found that at many popular times the water in the shower was only luke warm. The sink is a very small unit which can be used from a wheelchair, but there is very little stowage space on the small shelf. The hairdryer is attached to the wall here. The toilet is in the corner with a long grab rail attached to the wall on the right hand side. Any disabled guest who needs to transfer directly from a wheelchair would be able to do so from the left hand side only. There is a washing machine and a tumble drier in the bathroom. The directions for using the washing machine did not actually match the machine and we needed to ask for assistance. The bed was comfortable enough without feeling luxuriously so. There is a television in the bedroom as well as one in the living room. Although situated next to the motorway, our sleep was not disturbed at all by traffic noise, however we chose not to use the balcony, so as not to encourage traffic fumes into the room. It had no worthwhile view anyway. The CD player in the living room was broken on arrival and we needed to request a change, which was carried out the following morning. We also had problems with a persistent noise emitting from the dishwasher, although we had not even used it. This required visits from a technician on 2 separate occasions. I have to mention that although we had several different problems with equipment in the apartment, all issues were resolved courteously. The $30 daily charge for broadband is a downside of this hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I would say the same about all properties that make such a charge. There is no ethernet cable actually in the apartment, it needs to be requested from Reception if you do not have your own with you, with a $5 deposit. The hotel key swipe cards were too sensitive, which proved a little irritating in the lift. Nearby convenience stores were very expensive (due to the location) for those wishing to self cater. More positively, a take-away delivery service gave access to a large number of local take-aways which we used one night. Very convenient. The menus are displayed on the fridge door. Our daughter, who lives locally, parked her car in the garage over the evening of New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve. The charge of $30 was reasonable for central Sydney, particularly as she did not retrieve it until the morning of 2nd January. This was much appreciated. The apartment was cleaned, with beds made, every day, when we had expected it might only be twice a week as it was an apartment rather than full service hotel. The dirty dishes were even washed. This was a very good service. We found that this property was perfectly serviceable as a city centre apartment hotel. Clean, comfortable and convenient for Darling Harbour. All staff were friendly and polite. This type of property is most useful for anyone staying in Sydney for longer than a few days, whether on business or for leisure. We appreciated being able to do our laundry. I am happy to recommend this property. For luxury full service hotels we went elsewhere (the Shangri-La, and the Sheraton on the Park are excellent choices of full service hotels having standard rooms with both bath and separate shower). For any potential disabled or reduced mobility travellers who have found this review useful, I advise them to also consult the website www.wheelie-easy-hotels.com which offers information on hotels world-wide.

It's more like a self-serviced apartment. It's very comfortable to stay here, and considering the price I paid, I'm very happy with the overall experience. I think I'll come back again. The only thing not very smooth is the way they charge your account. I booked the room on Medina's website, and I thought I paid for the accommodation already (cause I provided my CC details online). But it turned out that the money wouldn't be deducted until arriving. I had to re-check my CC statement online to ensure I hadn't paid for the accommodation before I provided my CC details again. There is a computer nearby with the access to the Internet. After I checked out and fully paid for my accommodation, the hotel still withheld certain amount of money and release the amount after 5-7 working days. It's quite confusing and takes me a while to understand. But overall everything is cool.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cWhat a fantastic Hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "reviewinsyd", "ReviewID": "UR18897066", "Content": "We booked via the Medina webiste and got a great deal, it wasn't last minute either so it was great to get a good deal when we planned ahead.
