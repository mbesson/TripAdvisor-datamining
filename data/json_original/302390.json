{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Functional This is what I could call a big and boxy, ordinary Japanese urban hotel -- catering to the Japanese traveling middle class, some foreigners and, especially it seems, flight crews. My very expensive room was not ready until mid-afternoon on check-in on New Year's Day. This was irritating after flying in from South Asia. But I understood that the place had been fully booked for New Year's Eve. The rooms are modern with good amenities supplied. There is in -room high-speed broadband, which is free.The hotel is an easy walk to Shinagawa station.My only major complaint was that when I ordered an ala carte breakfast I got cold eggs but they were replaced quickly with profuse apologies. I don't know that I would stay here again, however, unless there were absolutely no other choices in this category (which is how I ended up here in the first place).", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR195089354", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "7J1AIL"}, {"Content": "Heated in Chilly Tokyo!

The location is extremely convenient to the station and worked as a good central spot to go around town. By subway, nothing was more than 190 Yen (about 15 Min) away, and making the connection to the N\u9225\u6a62X was very easy. The station isn\u9225\u6a9b too bad to navigate through either.Onto the room. I stayed on the Pacific Level floors and in a double room and it was very tastefully redone in a modern style. Everything was new, and even included full personal kits for two people with high line products and a CD/ DVD player  LCD TV. Although not huge, (It\u9225\u6a9a Japan, remember) the bathroom was very large  had everything in it. After being in hotels all week with \u9225\u6de2odule Bathrooms\u9225? it was a very nice break. I\u9225\u6a87 put it level with the better Westin  Marriott remodels found in the US. Spend the extra to get this room type, it\u9225\u6a9a worth it.The hotel is older but appears that they are updating areas quietly, as I didn\u9225\u6a9b see any construction but there were signs of new items around the place. The gardens are very nice. Also, if you are extremely homesick for mass produced US food, they have a TGI Fridays as part of the hotel. But there are many better options directly across the street in the plaza attached to the Sony building. Service I found to be great and the breakfast buffet was quite large, at 2350 Yen it did give all the items you would expect at that price. At breakfast, I left behind a guidebook in the restaurant and went up to my room. Before I got there, they had already taken the book to the front desk  called my room to let me know I forgot it. And they were very accommodating about a late check out request. The hotel does cater to international travelers, so language was not an issue, especially at the front desk.", "Date": "Jul 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR592891755", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MFRoadWarrior"}, {"Content": "Great Location.

I stayed at Le Meridien Pacific for three nights in September, 2007. I found the accommodations to be more than adequate, but not the same as Western hotel accommodations at all! I'm not sure what rate my company paid for the rooms, but I know they weren't cheap. The room contained two beds; I'm guessing twin size or something pretty close. They were nothing like the cushy beds we've come to expect in American hotels. Very hard and not particularly comfortable. The room was very clean. The shower in the bathroom was wonderful; great water pressure. (although it took me a few minutes to figure out how it was supposed to work!!) As in most offices, restaurants, and hotels that I experienced in Japan, the toilet was a bidet. Most interesting in contrast to the Japanese-style toilets that are basically just troughs in the ground! If you visit Japan, be sure to look for the signs that point towards the western toilets!There was a fairly well-stocked mini bar in the room, although I didn't use anything except the coffee (included water, beer, wine, liquors, snacks). No coffee maker in the room; however, there was a ceramic stove eye of sorts that you could use to heat water. There was a sort of drip package of coffee available on the mini bar which cost approximately $3 US.(made one cup). Not too bad if you need caffeine before you face the world!I had a very nice view out of my window, especially at night.I'm not sure if the hotel offers bell service ; it wasn't offered to our group but it may be because the company told them we'd take care of ourselveslThe breakfast buffet offered more than you could possibly want. There were many Japanese offerings as well as traditional Western foods. There was a salad bar; Japanese rice porridge; Miso soup; and a few other Japanese items. There was also an omelet station where a chef would prepare your omelet to order(fascinating to watch him with a small saute pan and only two chopsticks as cooking utensils; made an absolutely beautiful omelet!) There were also several fruit selections, several types of cereal; bacon, ham, scrambled eggs, fried eggs, boiled eggs, and a great assortment of pastries (NOT cheap doughnuts; there were croissants, chocolate croissants, and an apple pastry made from croissant dough that was to die for!) You could also make toast if you wished; and I believe pancakes were offered at least one of the mornings I was there. Again; not sure of the cost, as my company paid for it, but it was extremely good.If I were traveling to Tokyo, I would probably check out all the options as far as cost; but there wouldn't be any reason not to recommend this hotel if the cost was reasonable.", "Date": "Oct 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR532547129", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "JMRN"}, {"Content": "Only an OK Shinagwa hotel If you have business in Shinagawa area, this hotel is perfectly located next to the station and the Takanawa shopping and restaurant wings. That's probably the best thing about it, with exception of perhaps rather lovely garden and man-made waterfalls one overlooks from the buffet breakfast room.Hotel is dated, service (for Japan) is somewhat average, not too clean, not too anything. Cups not cleaned away from previous day, supplements not replaced. Breakfast is also very average, but you get vouchers, and that's better than having to wonder around looking for something in the morning, or relaying on its average room service menu. There is no fitness room.Add to that the fact that there was absolutely no internet connection on the 21st floor I stayed in, it's not a flash proposition for a business stay. The so-called 'business lounge, consisting of 5 chairs randomly assembed in the lobby where people with no business as such hang out or loiter and is useless.

It was very limited with mainly American-style selections such as scrambled eggs, bacon, pastries, juices and cereal. I got tired of it after a couple of mornings. I was hoping to have more Asian foods in the buffet. The room was fine, comfortable bed and nice room decor. The bathroom was motel-like with a standard tub-shower and tiny surface area to put bathroom things like toothpaste or a shaver.
