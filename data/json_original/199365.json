Do not be put off by this small area around it, its a short walk. The hotel rooms were spacious with sofa and chairs, also TV and mini bar. The shower is again 10/10 as is the room and the rest of this hotel. Take in the many sights of Berlin and one part of the wall is a short walk back down past the station. As well as the usual tours DO NOT FORGET to take the U-Bahn to Gesundbrunner station where the Berlin Unterwelten is situated, it is a 90 minute under ground tour of a Berlin bunker. We took the English tour guided by \"Sean\", it was informative and very funny but this gives you a close look at one of Berlin's air raid shelter. Back to the hotel, all eight of us gave this 10/10.

It's typical of a 4 star German hotel - clean, compact, efficient and serves an excellent buffet breakfast. The location is very good, although it's a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest trains and trams, so you might not want to take pubic transport to/from the airport unless you don't have much luggage to carry. A taxi from Tegel Airport cost \u20ac29. As well as easy access to central Berlin on the S Bahn, there's plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants a short walk away on Simon-Dach-Strasse, as well as the East Side Gallery (a part of the Berlin Wall which is now an open air art gallery). Supermarkets are conveniently located on R\u00fcdersdorfer Strasse (for Aldi) or Gubener Strasse (for Kaiser). There's also numerous kebab shops in the area if you want a quick, cheap snack. I found Antalya (corner of Kopernikusstrasse and Warschauer Strasse) to be the best tasting. The hotel staff were helpful, very familiar with the area and happy to answer all my tourist questions. The hotel bar wasn't great, as it was lacking in atmosphere and overpriced for drinks (\u20ac4.50 for a large beer), but being Berlin, there are plenty of alternatives. As others have said, no free in room wi-fi is a shame, and so is the lack of air conditioning, but I'm sure it's not a major problem apart from the hottest months. There were also some reviewers who commented on the beggars not far from the hotel on the walk to the train station. Simply do as the locals do and ignore them.

The room was huge and still had plenty of room for a \"living room area\". The breakfasts are fab, with as much choice as one could wish for. They even had Earl Grey Tea! The only bad thing about this hotel is no air conditioning - and boy is it needed! (Berlin was very hot when we were there). I would stay here again! My top tips to see Berlin: 1)Get the Welcome card (It is available at the airport tourist information) and it will cover all your trains (including the one from the airport into Berlin). It also allows up to 3 children (under 15) to travel with you. It gives great discounts on various things to see and do so it really is worth the inital investment. 2) Go up the TV tower. You can see all of Berlin from there (and get a discount if you have the welcome card) and they do the most fab cocktails! 3) If you want to go to the Reichstag - book online in advance. It is free entry but too busy to just drop by (We learnt this the hard way!) 4) Research where you want to visit in advance - and include resteurants in that research. We found ourselves walking for an hour to find a decent place to eat! 5) Visit the Wall and Potsdamer Platz. It gives you a chance to really see the changes that have taken place over the last 22 years. 6) Go on a boat cruise. It is a beautiful way to see the city.

We were very happy with the high standard of cleanliness, pleasant decor and lovely breakfasts (I know everyone says it, but they really do set you up for the day!) and we were able to watch Columbo in German on the TV with a very reasonably-priced local beer from the minibar when we felt like it. The hotel was within walking distance of a cool flea market and a cheap and delicious vegan/veggie (& meat) cafe called Hot Dog & Soup, and just down the road from a gorgeous-looking pub that we never quite made it along to - next time! Everything else we wanted to visit (Reichstag, TV tower, Schlossgarten etc.) was just a short Ubahn ride away and we found the public transport system very efficient and easy to use. Which reminds me - to get there from Tegel airport, if you don't want to shell out for a taxi, you just need to buy a ticket for zones 1&2 from the yellow machines by the airport bus stops, get the X9 to Zoo (Zoologischer Garten), and a Ubahn to Warschauer Strasse or Frankfurter Tor. By the way, if you're veggie, there are plenty of places serving excellent falafel around Berlin, so don't worry about it all being sausage and sauerkraut! If you want to treat yourself, I'd also recommend Cookies Cream for more imaginative veggie cuisine and they work very hard to make you grateful you were permitted to experience it! (see restuarant reviews) Back to the hotel - the 'gym' was very small, and we didn't get a chance to try the sauna as we were never around between 6.30 and 10pm when it was open, but we had a look at the roof terrace, and tried out a solar room thing that was quite fun. So, altogether it was perfect for our needs - if there was anything to moan about, and there isn't really, it was a shame that wifi was only free in the lobby area, which meant that we had to spend time uploading our photos in the functional, but rather soulless, entrance area rather than in the comfort of our room.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cOK IF YOU REALLY NEED THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT OTHERWISE I WOULD LOOK ELSEWHERE\u201d", "Author": "StealthySteven", "ReviewID": "UR82588335", "Content": "Booked two nights at $120 per night. As quality hotels in Berlin are often less expensive than in other large cities, I expected more from the Upstalsboom. First of all, everything seems very clean and in good condition so I have no complaints about that. I had a corner room with a panoramic view and the room was fairly large, but laid out poorly. The very small flat panel TV was about the size of a computer monitor, and the only English channels were BBC news and MTV. Good blackout drapes certainly help for those who like to sleep late. I liked that there was a second closeable door leading into the bedroom which kept out almost any noise that might have come from the hallway. But the bathroom was extremely small with only one tiny halogen light in the ceiling which really didn\u2019t light up the room enough. No light anywhere near the mirror made it difficult see while shaving. Small stand alone wash basin with only an extremely small glass shelf above which could barely hold essential toiletries. Shower (no bathtub) in the corner was just part of the normal floor of the bathroom separated only by a shower curtain. When you use the wash basin, you are partially standing on the shower floor. Combination soap/shampoo was dispensed from squeeze bottles attached to the wall in the shower area and next to the wash basin. No separate bar soap or small shampoo bottles provided. I forgot to bring toothpaste and the reception provided me a kit containing a small toothbrush and toothpaste free of charge so I appreciated that. Furnishings were functional, but certainly did not give a feeling of luxury. The one telephone was on a desk completely across the room from the bed. So if you want to make or receive phone calls while in bed, it isn\u2019t possible. No clock in the room\u2026. Good thing I always bring my own small one with me. Wifi is available free in the lobby, but costs a whopping 8 Euro PER HOUR if you want to access the internet from your room. Parking: 14 Euro per day. Room service menu extremely limited. No complaints about the front desk staff. They were extremely helpful with requests. The hotel is in a very quiet area of mostly apartment buildings and offices and I could not find a lot of good dining choices in the immediate area.

The rooms are on the small side accompanied by small bathrooms but the space is large enough for you to crash at the end of a long day's sight seeing. One small note -the very comfortable king size beds are pushed up against the wall meaning that you have to climb over your partner or slide down to the end of the bed to get out for that visit to the bathroom. You could do what I did and wait for your partner to get up first giving you that extra 10 minutes that you deserve in a warm bed. Another quick point - expect two single bed covers and a single square shaped pillow - very traditional and can be romantic if you want to share otherwise no need to fight for who gets the quilt. House keeping have lots of extras if you need them. The bathrooms are modern with endless amounts of hot water and all the space that you need but again be warned its a walk in shower only unless specified. The hotel provides quality soaps and creams etc and house keeping does a good job of cleaning everything and providing fresh towels etc when requested. The room includes a small table and arm chair, a telephone, a small flat screen TV with about 25 programmes free of charge (mainly in German but there was BBC World News and a few music channels to occupy you if needed). A sky package in English at 12 Euros per day gives a few move sky channels including films and adult entertainment but I already pay sky enough at home for this and the thought of paying them again at these rates sends me spare! Wifi is present and free of charge thorughout the building. A standard mini bar provides you with all the usual temptations but surprisingly (or not given where this hotel chain comes from) Jever beer in the fridge compared to the standard Berliner beer. Prices are at the higher end of reasonable. Location wise the hotel stands in a residential area covered with graffiti, which in Berlin is a very good thing. At first glance you may find this off putting but look deeper and you'll see some excellent shops and services sit behind what would otherwise be a dull concrete wall. As stated earlier the hotel is readily accessed by S-Bahn at Warshauer Stasse. It's also very close to the continuous 1.3km length of original Berlin Wall still standing in the city. Ironically during my visit this month parts of this wall were being demolished and rebuilt presumably for health and safety reasons after so many holes were made in it. I was lucky to speak with one of the original artists who was busy repainting his original artwork from a photo taken in 1989 on the newly repaired wall. This section of wall is well worth a visit. The hotel provides a good quality breakfast in an all you can eat affair from very early in the morning to 10:30 am weekdays and 11 am weekends & public holidays. I didn\u2019t use the hotel restaurant or bar / lounge area so can\u2019t give me verdicts for these two areas. My main reason for this is because there\u2019s a fantastic bar on the door step (out the hotel door turn left and across the road) call \u201cHirsch\u201d, the German word for Deer. At Hirsch you can eat and drink is authentic southern German style. The food menu is small but offers fantastic quality and very reasonable prices. The cocktails are good and the bottle beer choice stretches to some 29 different bands in various strengths and sizes. To sample the entire bottle beer choice would equate to about 8 litres of beer for approximately 40 Euros. The staff are a friendly and helpful sort with good English and other language skills. The Hirsch bar comes highly recommended. Other local eat include a fantastic \u2013 high quality \u2013 kebab shop on the Warshauer strasse which you pass to get to the S-Bahn. The shop is called \u201cSaray\u201d and they provide great home made meals for very little money. They have a good selection of food and speak a blend of English, Turkish and German. The eatery is very popular with locals and again is highly recommended. If you won\u2019t try it you\u2019ll never know just how good a meal it was that you missed. All in the hotel is easily recommended. Go ahead and make you booking worry free. It\u2019s a no brainer.", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haywards Heath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location, lovely room\u201d", "Author": "Vokon", "ReviewID": "UR45586216", "Content": "Stayed here for 4 nights to explore Berlin.

Totally loved it. Had a quiet room that faced an inner courtyard. Good-sized wardrobe with safe. Huge bed. Recently renovated, largeish shower/bathroom with huge mirror and decent lighting. The breakfast buffet is a real hit -- massive choice, both sweet and savoury. Everything very fresh. I particularly liked the varieties of smoked and pickled fish on offer, alongside the cheeses, meats, jams, cereals, juices. Lots of different types of bread, rounded off by cakes. Breakfast ran until 10.30am (11am at the weekends -- very civilised). Basically, if you fill up in the morning, you won't need lunch. Excellent breakfast service -- trays refilled v quickly and attentive staff. They also do room service of sorts: you order something from a menu, they make it for you and then you take the tray up to your room. Wasn't too sure about that though and felt that room service should mean room service. The roof terrace is another wonderful feature, esp. in the summer. They often do barbecue buffets up there, and you can eat while watching the sun go down over the rooftops. The hotel has a nice restaurant too, and a bar, but I also liked the little cafe round the corner (great mojitos!), the fondue restaurant on the corner and the pancakes in the cozy kneipe across the road. The location is quiet -- you can't hear Warschauer Strasse round the corner, but the hotel is very close to the happening restaurant district Simon-Dach-Strasse. Friedrichshain is fast taking over from Prenzlberg and Kreuzberg as Berlin's food and fashion hotspot. Wuehlishstrasse, with its many fashion boutiques, is not far on foot. Restaurant-wise, Simon-Dach-Strasse is excellent value for money. Another reviewer felt the area looked tatty -- but this is Berlin's East so not everything will have been renovated yet. Because rents are (still) relatively cheap, artists and designers can afford to live, create and sell here. And some Gruenderzeit facades are absolutely fascinating as is the Zuckerbaecker style in nearby Karl-Marx-Strasse. To get into the centre of Berlin, the S-Bahn is maybe 5-10 mins away on foot. Expect joyous crowds there drinking from beer bottles and moving on to the next club at 2am in the morning -- to zero aggro. That's how it should be. A tip: Volkspark Friedrichshain offers open-air cinema in the summer. Pick an English-language film (look for \"OmU\" -- original version with subtitles), pay 6 Euros, buy a bottle of beer and a sausage and enjoy the show.", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "giddalause", "ReviewID": "UR32476497", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel with our baby girl who is 9 months old.

This was my sixth or seventh visit to Berlin and first stay at the Upstalsboom. The Good: The hotel is very clean. It is fairly new construction which is something I like in a hotel. It is located in a residential neighborhood, about 10 minutes from the nearest train and there are some convenient local food markets and restaurants. The staff is fantastic. They answered all my questions cheerfully, made dinner reservations for me, called taxis, gave directions and never hesitated to help out. I have stayed in luxury hotels where the level of service wasn't as good. The hotel has a beautiful roof garden where you can relax and have something to drink or just sit and read. The breakfast buffet was good and the dining room was pleasant. There is a computer for free high speed internet access. The not so good: My room was an attic room with a sloping roof. There was a large widow on the sloped roof and it was right over the bed. Since it was unseasonably warm and there is no ventilation in the hotel rooms I left the window open the first day and there was a severe rain/hail storm. The water poured in and onto my bed. The next day I closed the window when I left. Once again there was a severe storm. When I got back I found that the cleaning staff had left the window open and the water had once again poured onto the bed. Both times the front desk attendant came up to my room and very cheerfully changed the bedding and carried away the soaked blankets and pillows. I would suggest that if you are given one of these top floor rooms during the warmer months you might ask to be changed to another floor. Also, with no air conditioning the rooms in this hotel get very, very warm. I would probably choose a different hotel were I to return between May and September. Another negative about the room is that it had a door to the adjacent room. There was absolutely no sound proofing so the first night I had the very loud sound of the tv next door booming through my room until 1am.

Overall, value for money, not in a great part of the city (at night), and not in my opinion 4 star.", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "TEESSIDE ,United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Base\u201d", "Author": "Garyn", "ReviewID": "UR6088033", "Content": "Dont let the surrounding streets make you think you've made a mistake.Once you see the foyer you realise the quality .Fantastic service ,lovely room ,nice breakfast what more can I say.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in an excellent location. To begin it only takes five minutes walk from the hotel to either the S-bahn and the U- bahn. The S-bahn can have you back at Schoenenfeld airport in 35mins and only takes 10mins max into the city centre. The area around the hotel has a lot to offer. Literally across the road is an excellent bar called \u2018Hirsch\u2019, which I recommend and a five minute walk away on Simon-Dach Strasse there is an uncountable amount of bars restaurants and take aways available. The bars around hear where also very good, especially Dachkammer Bar, that I did not need to go into central Berlin to find nightlife as it was already on the doorstep. There is also a flea market in Boxhagener Platz on a Sunday which if you stay in this area should not be missed. The stuff on sale is amazing. The hotel is clean and functional and the hotel staff are very friendly and speak excellent English which is good as my German is pretty poor. The breakfast provided by the hotel is excellent and should not be missed. On the weekend if you get down late it may be hard to get a table. So that must be a good sign.
