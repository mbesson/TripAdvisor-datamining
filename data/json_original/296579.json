It is right in the middle of the Sultanahmet Square and Beyazit area which is very close (5 min. walking distance) to Grand Covered Bazaar, Blue Mosque, St.Sophia, Museums etc. I can say we only walked to reach anyplace we wanted to go. In addition, public transportation is only 100 yards away from the hotel in case you want to go to the public boats and other main transportation center. It was all convenient for us. Many restaurants, super markets are around there like you fell yourself at home. I don't think I could find a better location than that to spent my entire 10 days holiday. Hotel rooms are great, clean and in decent size. Breakfast was awesome! I could find different kind of cheese, olives, pastries, cakes, fruit juices, breads, traditional sesame bagels (simit), good quality coffee, tea etc. Service was great, Front desk, restaurant service and bellboy staff were very helpful and friendly. You can't beat that! We got all the answers from front desk for the questions we asked. They offered us Bosphorus and Princess Islands tours which were great and very enjoyable! I recommend them. Room was cleaning everyday by maids and they change the towels and sheet if you requested even everyday. Ohh I have add this; hotel lobby was gorgeous! It was very comfortable, stylish, well decorated! There are some chair and table you can sit front of the hotel and enjoy your drinks at night!

Staff: Absolutely friendly and helpful and very kind. When my money was stolen I was invited to have lunch with staff- see thats Turkish hospitality:-). 5 star staff. Room: I do agree that some rooms might be very near elevators and the noise they make. Same thing for rooms in lower floors- might be noisy- you are in the middle of everything:-) My room was on 5th floor- smallish as normal for this type of hotel. Clean towels and change of bedspread was done a couple of times during my week there. For a 3 star hotel I found it to be fine. Telly: no english news channels. Breakfast: I was pleasantly surpriced of selection for breakfast- very good for a hotel of 3 star.
