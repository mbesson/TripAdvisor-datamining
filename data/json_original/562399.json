We heard that due to the constraction site, the other hotel can be noisy, so wanted a hotel not far from the airport, just to sleep through the night. The location was not bad, walking distance to the metro and bus stop, so this was convienient, however the hotel was dirty and the furniture so used and old, that I was surprised they were not embarassed to be still using it. There were tea and coffee facilities in the room, but they were so old and worn off, we wouldn't touch it. The aircontitioning was only in the room, but not in the corridor??? The bathroom floor was dirty behind the door, which tells me, the room has not been cleaned properly. The hotel was next to the petrol station opened 24 hours, which played the music, the whole night. Also not sure why there was a step in the room. You had to be aware of it all the time while walking to the bathroom. In the summary, we survieved that one night, but I would never go back there, rather pay more, and go to a better hotel.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ludhiana, India", "Title": "\u201cCHANGI HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "bainicovijay", "ReviewID": "UR121970628", "Content": "New changi hotel located on the out skirt of singapore.New changi hotel location suitable for Changi airport Singapore.Its a economical ,well maintained having four star features.But it is far from the main business area of singapore. it is paradise for tour operaters to lowest package.Rooms are very good for comfort having modern bathroom .construction wise not so old. having facilties of swimming pools lifts,views are good,food quality very good, hospitality is too good.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kangra, India", "Title": "\u201cOverall good for its price\u201d", "Author": "paulanant", "ReviewID": "UR120156524", "Content": "Have stayed at this hotel twice upon my travel to Singapore. Considering its Singapore the price is the lowest once you start looking for decent hotels to stay in. However the rooms are quite nice and spacious for its price. Location is also good considering you can walk out of the hotel and find a 24 hours store next door and couple of decent hawker stalls to eat a decent meal at cheap price at a 50 meters walkable distance.

They must have been mad !!! We arrived late at this Hotel with a terrible review from the taxi driver. Had it not been so late at night I would not have stayed. Dirty everywhere - lift, carpets, room. Furniture old and full of cigarette burns as was the carpet. Torn curtains and no pillowcases. I spent the night half asleep continually scratching. Lighting quite dim which was a bonus so we could not see how disgusting the whole room was until the following morning. Bathroom dirty - splash marks over mirror, hairs in sink.

Pro's: * Very cheap. * Location was fine but not perfect. * Surprisingly big rooms, considering it's a budget hotel. * The beds were adequate and we both slept fine without any problems. * The sheets were changed daily and we never had any problems with dirty sheets. * Two free bottles of water daily, along with free tea/coffee. * Rooms were nicely air conditioned. * TV worked fine. * Bar fridge of an adequate size, certainly compared to the shoebox size that some more upmarket hotels have these days. They were also adequately clean. * Supplied us with a hair dryer and extra pillow when asked. Con's: * The corridors aren't air conditioned, which I guess isn't that surprising. * The carpets are quite heavily stained; even with some stains on walls and ceiling. * Bathroom wasn't very clean, although the toilets were clean enough. * The shower heads are water savers and let out a woefully inadequate amount of water. * The sheet that you lie on isn't big enough to tuck into the bottom of the bed, which you'll notice if you're 6 foot/180 cm tall like me. Oddly, though, it never disturbed my sleep. But if you're sensitive to that, and you're tall, then it could be a real problem. * The bar fridges are quite old and take a good day and a half to cool down to a reasonable temperature from being first turned on. * Some of the wall sockets and fittings really do need replacing, and could even be dangerous. Overall, this is very much a budget hotel - cheaper than the majority of other budget hotels in the area - and that shows. It's also passed it's prime. But other than the lousy shower, we never had any real problems with the hotel and was always able to get to sleep without any trouble. So would I recommend this hotel? If they didn't have luxury, or mid-range, hotels in mind and was willing to settle for something that wasn't pristine but good enough to get you to sleep, then yes, I would. But if you really do like all the comforts and luxuries of home then... to be honest, why are you looking at a budget hotel? P.S. During the two weeks, we stayed in 2 different rooms, because at one point we checked out to visit Malaysia for a couple of days.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWhat is worse, pubic hair in the sheets or the dirty wee in the toilet\u201d", "Author": "kath84", "ReviewID": "UR77433652", "Content": "this hotel is terrible! I travelled with my mother and thought this hotel would be ok because it looked clean enough with the online pictures....We were in transit in singapore for one night. OMG! we arrived so late into singapore that we had no choice but to stay there. I decided not to have a shower as i was put off by the wee that was in the toilet, (i had to clean it myself with my detol hand sanitiser) and the shower looked like a bidet that had been moved to the bath. The towels had a weird smell. There was no toilet role holder so the paper was just sitting on the wet bench in the bathroom and had half soaked up the water. The bed sheets had pubic hairs in them and although we had a good laugh of disbelief we were forced to sleep on top of the blankets and try not to think about the pubes. The pillow cases were disposable as well. They even looked pre-used so we had to get our sarongs out and put them on the pillow case. The funny thing was that when we arrived the girl at reception told us that we got an upgrade....we dare not imagine was a basic room would be like!", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney Australia", "Title": "\u201cDiscusting, dirty, run down hotel\u201d", "Author": "JanSydneyAustralia", "ReviewID": "UR74723761", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel as my husband booked me in while I was travelling to Asia.
