We showed up very late (11pm) and the hotel was 24 hours, which was nice. We were escorted to our room and shown how the keys work and wished a good evening. The gentleman spoke english well and we found everyone else there did also (which was good, because our Italian was very poor). The FREE included breakfast was nice. A good selection of a mix between continental and full breakfast. They also had proper coffee. Security was very good at this hotel, almost over the top, but not a bad problem to have right? The room was honestly beautiful that we stayed in. Beldes has two buildings and we stayed at the second building. The room was slightly small by USA standards, but you have to recognize where you are. The room is actually large for Rome. It has everything and the bathroom was great with a wonderful shower. The room and the whole hotel for that matter was very clean with daily maid service. It was also very quiet at night. We didn't stay in the main hotel but where we were had a great view of a really beautiful church and was quiet. I'd ask to stay in the second building I suppose if your worried about noise. I did notice however that the main hotel rooms looked just like our room when we would walk to breakfast. Again however, Location and price! Cheap and close to what you need. There were a few restaurants in the area but they all seemed pretty much the same with the same menu, so search around for a good place to eat, Italy has many of those.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel within walking distance of everything\u201d", "Author": "Fornuftig", "ReviewID": "UR127850130", "Content": "We visited start april and stayed for 4 nights.

I would recommend it to people who were visiting Rome. So when I happened to be revisiting Rome (I must have thrown my coins in Trevi fountain), there was only one place I wanted to stay -Beldes. Well, what a difference a couple of years makes. Perhaps absence makes the heart grow fonder.....but I have to say I was very disappointed. The first time I stayed the room was spacious, the bathroom was AMAZING and impeccably clean, breakfast was fabulous with a large selection of cakes, meats, tarts, fruit and barista worthy coffee on offer. This time the the room was pokey, the bathroom was laughable and breakfast was average. Our room was on the top floor. 6b if I remember rightly. Instead of the solid silver room numbers that adorn each room, our room had '6b' scrawled in pen on piece of curling masking tape. Not a good first impression. The room has been painted in dark chocolate brown paint, which has a nice effect apart from the fact it hasn't been repainted in years and it's chipped and cracked and really makes you feel as though you are staying in a dormitory. The bathroom is a flimsy add on. Meaning the bathroom has obviously been added on but done on a super tight budget, or maybe a DIY knock up job. So apart from being TINY, it's not very well ventilated. Just look at the walls in the bathroom...mouldy (shudder)! Also the bathroom fixtures are pretty second rate. I flushed the toilet and the whole flush plate mounted on the wall fell off with an almighty crash. My final gripe would have to be in regards to service. Having an early morning flight we booked an early morning taxi to the airport (4:15am). To me that means at 415am the hotel will arrange a taxi and it will be waiting downstairs at 415am. To the Beldes this means wait till the guests have checked out and are waiting on the curb (at 415am) and THEN call for a taxi which may or may not turn up for another 30 minutes. Perhaps we were just unlucky and got the short straw on this stay. Perhaps management need a lesson in maintenance and service. Perhaps there has been a change in management since I visited last. Unfortunately I won't be returning to find out!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ankara, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cNot good enough for the price.\u201d", "Author": "elifsy", "ReviewID": "UR125741329", "Content": "Hotel is very close to a metro station and walk distance from vatican.

Always ready to help out. Cons: 1) Although the hotel did look remodeled, you could still hear people through the rather thin walls, ie. walking on the hardwood floor, flushing their toilet or draining their tub next door, and one of our walls had a tiny hole, as if an electrical outlet was supposed to be there but was placed elsewhere. These were minor details that we had lived with, but it would be great if these were addressed in the long run. 2) Be prepared to stay in a room that doesn't look exactly as advertised, as each room is decorated differently but basic amenities remain the same such as en suite bath/shower, etc. For the price, I would still recommend this to those wishing to stay in Rome.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Donegal Town, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cLocation,location,location...\u201d", "Author": "Susied60", "ReviewID": "UR124051073", "Content": "Stayed here last weekend in Jan.

First initial greeting was warm and welcoming,was given maps and explanations where everything was etc..

The room was spotless and stunning,french style black and white theme,and the bathroom was beautiful,but what I really loved was the large rain shower shower head !! So relaxing,good water pressure! The other fantastic point was free wi-fi ! Just asked them for a code and I was online 24/7 for up to 7 days..that was really convenient and a nice touch compared to paying extravagant internet prices. Breakfast was lovely, there were definitely FRESH danish pastries every morning,selection of cheese's,ham's,tea cakes,breads,cereal's,boiled eggs,fresh juices and made to order coffee. Tip..get in early for breakfast,the breakfast room fills up around 8,30-9am. The rooms were cleaned daily to exceptional standard, possibly the cleanest I've come across,even the shower's were cleaned daily,and fresh fluffy towels.,mini bar was always stocked. Staff were so friendly and helpful. Nearby there are quite a few choices of restaurants,bar's and gelateria's, and 5 minute walk away you will find all the main leading shops,a large supermarket and it's also the way leading to the Vatican which was only 10 mins away. I saw all the sight's on foot,so it was a great location. Upon departure, I asked for a late checkout and was told 12pm,which meant I didn't have to rush, I then left all the luggage in storage at reception and then a lovely limousine transfer was booked for me for only \u20ac55 to the airport (a taxi can cost up to \u20ac60 ) fantastic service.

All the details were missing, like buttons off the bedheads and tops off the taps in the bathroom. Also the tiny safe wasn't bolted to anything so what was the point? Breakfast and proximity to the Vatican was good, however the location was a little seedy at night and restaurants were limited. The staff were not pleasant and rather dodgy, wanting you to pay before you'd seen the room. We stayed here twice as we had to return to Rome a second time before departing Italy. I would have found something else but unfortunately didn't have the time. On this second visit they put us in a totally different hotel. It was twice as far as the original annex and the decor was in a very shabby traditional style, nothing like the pictures.

What can I tell you? Well as a former Hotel Manager I am a bit picky about the properties that I stay in. In other words I know too much. I got the Hotel name from Tripadvisor and looked at all the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised by this property. It is spotlessly clean , with very friendly staff and a good quality breakfast. The room both my partner and I had was very adequate for what we needed and very clean. The bathroom is a bit on the small side but serves its purpose. This property is located in an area that is busy during the day and very quite in the evening. It is a bit off the tourist beaten track , which believe me is not a bad thing. It is located on the west of the Tiber river and is close to the Vatican City, about two metro stops away . There are some lovely Restaurants in the area and it wont cost the earth to eat out. The Hotel Beldes is newish and full of Modern art on the walls of the corridors leading to the bedrooms. Even though this property is newish it has some old world type furniture in the bedrooms and to me is a hidden gem. It is a boutique style hotel and it makes the property a little bit special, better than a large impersonal hotel. The breakfast is lovely . There is the usual continental fair of sliced meats and cheeses, juices , cakes and fresh coffee. One word of warning is get to the breakfast room early . Its small and located on the 2nd floor . It does get busy , so if you don't want other tourists eating everything like a plague of locusts get there, Monday to Friday 8am ish. Weekends I'm not sure. The Reception staff are very knowledgeable and have tourist maps to hand and can recommend local restaurants to you . Great Value. There is a Metro station \" Lepanto\" to the rear of the hotel and you are between one and three stops away to the east of the Tiber to all the tourist attractions , Spanish steps , Trevi Fountains etc. Overall couldn't recommend this hotel enough , if you want a very good base at an easy pace with the city on your step. Another tip is buy the Roma Pass if you are going to spend three days in Rome \u20ac25 and it covers all your metro , bus and tram price and get you into two major tourist attractions.

This trip was booked as a surprise for my partners 30th Birthday; I wanted to choose a unique boutique hotel instead of a multinational chain hotel to make it extra special and more romantic. I had seen the hotel on splendia.com and on the hotels official website and was impressed by the descriptions and photos. However, when we arrived we were told that we were staying in a separate building away from the hotel, which was two blocks away by foot. On arrival at this building it was in fact in a residential apartment building with no general facilities. Once inside the room, the decor and overall condition of the accommodation was good, the furnishings were stylish, however maybe a tad worn, but the bathroom was of a high standard and was clean and welcoming. I called the reception to clarify why I had been put into the separate building as on my initial booking I had paid a seperate amount and requested a non-annex room. The staff were very abrupt about this questioning and said that the rooms in the separate building were of a higher standard and much bigger. They seemed uninterested to answer my question of why there are two different prices for each building and insisted they were the same, they thought it was best we stay where we were. We decided to stay in the separate building and although we enjoyed our stay, the constant going back and forward for breakfast each morning, the use of Ironing facilities (which seemed to cause confusion and a lot of drama when asked about using an iron) and the use of the terrace was very annoying. If I had been travelling alone, I would not have been impressed staying in the separate building as we never saw any one else over there. You have to open 3 sets of main doors to access the rooms which would be quite daunting to some. Also the rooms do have a safe, however this is not attached to the wall and can be lifted and taken away very easily...some what pointless! I feel the photos displayed on the official website and on most promotional sites are very misleading as the rooms displayed are actually of the ones in the separate building and not of the main hotel. The main hotel rooms are plainly decorated and small in comparison. One major complaint would be the attitude and service of the staff who were rude and unwelcoming. Apart from the lady who served breakfast, the manager's and reception staff were abrupt and unapproachable, overall seemed very uninterested in customer satisfaction. On the whole I do feel that although the hotel has nice decor and good location for the sites of Rome it is let down by many basic fundamental facilities and attitude of staff.

We asked to change to a room with a bath and we're told they'd get back to us but never heard anything else about it and didn't see that member of staff again. We therefore decided to make do and not worry too much as the room was ok and clean. I wish however that we had moved as this room was very noisy. We could hear the toilet and the shower from next door but worse, we were right next to the breakfast room and were woken early every morning by plates, people and the TV. If you get put in 4B, move! I was also disappointed with the service. Again, nothing too terrible but i felt like no one made any special effort and it could have been so much better. Also whenever I went to the bar (which is the breakfast room) no body was there serving drinks even though it's meant to be open all day. I did like the breakfast and the breakfast room. If you're are looking for the pool table it's under the main table top! The roof garden looked lovely but too cold to be in use. It's in a resdiential area so away from the hustle and bustle but only a 10 minute walk to St peters Square and 10 minutes in the other direction to Piazza del Popolo. Make use of the Metro as it's only 1euro and so close. There are a few local resturants very close to the hotel - we ate in these are were impressed with the food and the price - plus it wasn't far to walk home!

The hotel is located in a VERY safe, friendly section of Rome. We walked around at 10 -11 pm without any fear or complication. The Metro (A line) is two short blocks away, Lepanto stop. It took us two minutes to walk to it. Better yet, most sights are within walking distance! (If you do stay for more than a couple of days, buy the 7 day pass, you can hop on and off Roman buses and trains without limit.) The hotel is tastefully decorated in French Provincial styling. (While refreshing in its own right, it's extremely welcoming after a day of sight-seeing the opulence of Rome.) I was tickled to see the attention to detail in the accouterments, including the whimsical and revolving artwork. One feels like they are staying at the house of a hip, young Roman, versus a stuffy, mass produced hotel. The room was very clean, with hard wood floors. The bed was comfortable and an extra pillow can be found on the top shelf of the armoire. Each room is equipped with a thermostat to control the temperature, a refrigerator (with mini-bar), safe, and hair-dryer. The rooms are average-sized in European standards. The bathrooms are spotless. The towels are thick and of excellent quality. (Italian hotels do not typically provide washcloths, so if you don't feel complete without them, pack a few of your own.) A glass-encased shower (which enables you to avoid the icky-hotel-shower-curtain-cling) with excellent water-pressure and bidet complete the bathroom. The Breakfast Room on the top floor is sunny and cheerful, stocked with good-quality linens and pastel-colored Italian china. The complimentary breakfast (served buffet style) includes: cold-cuts, cheese, rolls & croissants, fresh fruit, yogurt, several cereals, and a variety of delicious pastries. Say hello to Suzanna, who will bring coffee and tea to your table. After reading TA reviews, I was concerned about being \"relegated\" to the annex and emailed them requesting to stay in the main building. I spoke to a 50-something couple from Canada and a 20-something couple from France who both told us that they actually PREFERRED it. They both told me it was similarly decorated and maintained. Furthermore, the rooms appeared to be LARGER and QUIETER. So either way, don't fret, your stay at the Beldes will be enjoyable! Because of the wooden floors, sound does travel. But I'd prefer wooden floors -- which can be mopped and cleaned easily - over rugs - which trap vasts amount of bacteria and dirt - any day! If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs.

The hotel is situated just a few moments away from Lepanto metro station, so we found the hotel easily from Ciampino airport. (just take the bus from Ciampino airport to Termini rail station & jump on the metro line A and get off at Lepanto). As mentioned in a previous review the hotel plaque is very small, so it would be quite easy to miss the entrance unless you had the full address. On arrival we were welcomed & taken to our room, we were in room 6A, which was a good size pretty room with a \"French Boutique\" feel to it. The room probably could have done with a lick of paint, and the hot & cold taps on the shower/taps were round the wrong way!! but other than that it was fine, especially for the price we paid. The breakfast room is upstairs and is served until 10am, it was a continental breakfast, including rolls, cheese, meats, croissants, cereals, yougarts, fruit and some AMAZING cakes mmmm, we really filled up on breakfast and rarely felt hungry again before the afternoon. The rooftop terrace is a really nice place for chilling out, we did not really use it, but I can imagine in the Summer its a great place to spend the evening with a few drinks. The small reception area always seemed to be manned, and the staff were so friendly & helpful, they gave us maps, directions, resturant reccomendations & information whenever we needed it.

John Paolo, one of the owners, was on site each day and very pleasant and helpful. The combination dining room/living room had the feel of being in a home. We enjoyed the many small attentions to detail of the decor and the feeling of being home.

Most parts are true, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the place is pretty much spotless, however, there are some inconsistencies. I was enticed by the description of 'stylish bar with pool table', 'roof top garden' and 'experienced cocktail barman'; there is no bar, just a breakfast room which is completely unmanned except for when breakfast is served, and there is no pool table. I walked up the stairs to the top floor to try a cocktail on the roof top garden only to find a completely empty space, except for a pile of building materials. I know the place has recently opened but I would expect them to hold back on the advertising until it's actually finished. It's also pretty hard to spot from outside as the entrance boasts the name of the hotel next door - when you look through the entrance, there are two doors, their's has an A4 piece of paper stuck on it that says 'Beldes HR' . Other than the false advertising, it was a nice place to stay.", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coral Springs, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLoved this Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ikey626", "ReviewID": "UR10426893", "Content": "nicest little boutique hotel we've stayed in in Italy!
