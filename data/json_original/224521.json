Rentals are also available. We stayed in a two bedroom unit with friends that we enjoy traveling with. The unit was very roomy with full kitchen, eating area and full living room, along with a nice balcony overlooking the pool and water. The master bedroom is very large and comfortable, while the second bedroom is much smaller and quite basic. All in all, the unit is extremely comfortable with a number of amenities including a washer and dryer. The several story building has elevators with parking available underneath on ground level. The property is in good repair. This resort is a rather laid back, low key, relaxing property. It has a pool, hot tub, Tiki bar/simple meals, with live entertainment (vocalist) in the evenings. The pool is very attractive, though it can get crowded. The property also has a very small beach on site, large enough for a few lounge chairs, but a beach none the less. The property offers two welcome barbecues a week with low cost burgers/chicken/hot dogs and raffles of services/discounts in the area. Attending is a good way to mix with fellow guests and share notes about restaurants, activities, etc. I found the staff at the reception desk to be extremely pleasant and a wealth of good suggestions regarding restaurants and activities. Elaine, the activities person and pool attendant is a real sweetheart. She gave us great suggestions regarding restaurants to try. The absolute best feature of this property is location, location, location! One could not ask for more. It is located right on the marina with beautiful views from the sun bathing decks. One can watch the boat activity, fishing activity, water sports, bird life, etc. Very pleasing! From this property, one can walk everywhere. Located on the marina, it is adjacent to where the Harbor Walk begins with a multitude of restaurants, bars, entertainment, water sports, boat excursions, and shopping. It is also wonderful to walk this area in the morning for beautiful photography opportunities and to see all the activity begin. Key West is a walking town. Get a perspective and a bit of knowledge by taking the Conch Train Tour upon arrival. It is well narrated and it will set you in the right direction for all of your walking excursions. Mallory Square, the gathering place from which to view sunsets and see street performers do their thing, is just a few blocks from the Galleon. The start of Duvall Street, known for shopping, restaurants, bars, and entertainment begins just one block from the Galleon. Many tourist attractions are just a few blocks away as well. When walking on the side streets, roosters, chickens, and cats are abundant. They add to the color and flair of Key West. The tropical gardens of the individual homes that one passes by are a lovely site. Key West is filled with a great variety of restaurants in all price ranges. One just needs to walk and look at menus as one passes by. You can even get glimpses of diners and of food being served at the various outdoor sitting areas. The thought, \u201cThat looks good\u201d might lead you in to sit down and place your order. Restaurants where we had a great meal: Abbondanza Italian Restaurant, Blue Heaven, Mangia, Mangia, Duffy\u2019s Steak and Lobster House, and Fogarty\u2019s. There are several beaches in Key West, all man made. Port Zachary Taylor State Park has a nice beach where one can spend the day. Lounge chairs are available for rent. It is within walking distance from the Galleon - a longer walk, or a short cab drive. Higg\u2019s Beach, Rest Beach, and Smather\u2019s Beach are closer to the airport and a cab ride from the resort. An enjoyable/educational activity to participate in while in Key West is kayaking through the mangrove creeks. We did the two hour guided tour for $35 through Lazy Dog Kayak Guides located at the Hurricane Hole marina. This is a very professional operation. When arriving in Key West, one can fly into the Key West Airport or fly into Miami and rent a car in order to drive the Keys. Each has its appeal. Allow 4 hours for the drive from Miami to Key West. We have done both for variety. Driving offers a good perspective on how the Keys are situated. We had a good week in Key West at the Galleon. The Galleon is a fine resort in a happy, colorful town.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richardson, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNice Timeshare at Galleon Resort\u201d", "Author": "krempert", "ReviewID": "UR125209725", "Content": "My wife and I had a great week at the Galleon resort in Key West last weekend.

A&B's- fantastic dinner overlooking marina (pricey) Alonza's-Happy hour 1/2 price drinks ($2 beer) and appetizers (1 pound shrimp $12!)

The bathroom door on the inside looked as if there had been a leak from the toilet as the wood was coming off the bottom. Ironically, the closet was large. Our room had only one window, no balcony or other source of light. Unfortunately we had to keep the blinds closed as the view we had was the garbage. That's right, in the E building where we were, literally right outside your door are the recycling bins for paper, plastic and bottles. And right outside your window is a large garbage bin. Anytime someone tosses in their garbage or bottles, you can hear it - at 3:00 a.m. Check out is at 10:00 a.m., we left at 8:00 a.m. Couldn't wait to get out of there. Manager was useless. When we complained about the room, the only thing he could do for us was to offer us a more expensive room. Believe me, this room was $275 +, double the price of the fantastic hotel Pegasus International on Duval. Yup, that's what you get at the Galleon for $275 - tiny, dark room with no view in a timeshare that is not kept up. I will never go there again.

We do have to agree with the other reviews that are here that the location is the best part of the resort. A short walk to the north end of Duval, around the marina to the multiple day cruises, or to the best part Mallory Square for the sunset. The checkin process was easy with the very helpful front desk staff. The female employee that checked us in gave us a map of the area and pointed out some recommendations for places to eat. Parking is a bit tight if you have a larger car, but it is an island where there is not a lot of space to park in general. The options for places to catch some sun were nice. It was nice to have the deck area off the tiki bar if you didn't want to sit by the pool where there were more kids and families playing or the midweek games of bingo were taking place. The Tiki bar is a good stop to grab a quick drink and on site food options were adequate. The unit was clean on checkin, the furniture a bit dated, but the bathroom update was a nice treat. We had a unit with a marina view (E building) and noise from the marina was never a problem. There were many nights after we had worn out our legs walking Duval that we rested on the deck and could enjoy the music from the local places on the marina that never went too late. If you didn't want to venture to Mallory Square with the crowds for the sunset, the observation deck was a nice option. The other residents up there were even nice enough to exchange picture taking responsibilites to get a couple's picture. There were many options of activities leaving from the marina in the area of the Galleon. Rent a waverunner, go parasailing, charter a fishing boat, day cruises, sunset cruises, etc all you had to do is take a short walk to find it. A nice option for the sight-seeing is the city trolley tours that left from just in front of the custom's house. They take you by all the major spots and you can jump on and off all day.

This side of the resort also has quite a bit of noise from the tiki bar below and from the surrounding units. The beds were very uncomfortable, the furniture dated and worn and a strong odor of urine on check in. The pool and spa were great but it was pretty much a day care center from 9-5. There was a sign with an age limit for the spa but it was invariably filled with the swim diaper set. The deck overlooking the water was a top feature but the lounge chairs were the worst I have experienced. On the positive there were very good bloody mary's at the tiki.

The two men working at the front desk were rude and had obviously not been trained properly by the corporation. No one told us that check-out was at 10:00 am and we had no idea considering the fact that check in was at 4:00 pm rather than the usual 3:00 pm of other hotels. At 10:00 am sharp we heard a banging noise on the door and to our amazement it was the man from front desk, yelling that we had to leave since check out was at 10:00 am. We asked if there was a late check out since we were not ready and he yelled \"No, you have 5 minutes!\" 15 minutes later as we were walking out he came back to tell us that we had to leave.

Located at the end of Front Street (617) with a marina and spectacular gulf views it is only a couple blocks to the wild scene of Duval Street. My girlfriend and I stayed at The Galleon Resort and Marina with a few friends over Memorial Day weekend. Everything went perfect and to plan from making our reservation with Faith in mid March to the friendly check in. We arrived on the Thursday prior to Memorial Day and immediately began to enjoy our suite and have fun on the rock called Key West. The resort offers several floor plans, has a decent pool with jacuzzi, small private beach, expansive sun deck, a fun Tiki Bar and grill and has a marina with slips if you bring a boat. You can even fish right off the resort desk. We did some 3:30 a.m. fishing and the tarpon were biteing! The private beach area has an enclosed portion of the gulf for resort guests. We snorkeled and were able to get up and close to schools of squid, abundant conch, crabs and a small baracuda that was ziping in and out from under the deck. The enclosed gulf area has a floating dock for sun bathers and the beach area has chairs and chaise lounges. The pool area manager rounds up guests to play in games of bingo. I couldn't believe how serious the pool area gets when bingo is being played. Inside the resort you have a sauna, changing room and shower area. Pool towels can be picked up at the front desk and exchanged at the pool daily. The Galleon Resort has a series of buildings, most of which are connected. We stayed in building C which is far and away the best location as it offers the closest and best gulf and sunset views. Our room was a corner room which was great because the master suite has its own private balcony and a view of the pool. If you can not book or buy into C, then I would suggest buildings B or A which offer pool view as well as gulf view. Building F offers a nice Marina view. I would avoid building G as it only offers street and parking lot views. Take it from us, try The Galleon. It is a top 5 place to stay at in Key West and it has the best location.

The positives.. you cannot beat the location. Located right on the water (with a very small private beach), the pool and tiki bar (both nice) overlook the water. The sunsets are beautiful from the pool area. It's about a block away from Duval Street, so walking to most places is very convenient. It's also a short walk away from the wharf that many of the touring companies depart for watersports or sunset cruises. The concierge is helpful in arranging activities, and the staff is friendly and helpful. There is a bike/scooter/electric car rental right at the entrance of the Galleon, which is convenient for areas that you cannot walk. If you plan to book any activities, see the concierge as you many be eligible for a better rate as a guest of the Galleon. The gym is pretty decent and never crowded while we were there. The negatives.... the pool gets very crowded (we went during busy season) and pool chairs are very hard to come by. Most patrons arrive early and reserve a chair with their towel for the entire day (even though signs specifically prohibit this), so get out early if you want a chair. Also, the food service at the tiki bar is questionable. Our appetizer took 30 minutes and was not even warm upon arrival. Free Internet, but the wifi signal is weak. Our laptop had a hard time acquiring a reliable signal. Overall, pleasant experience and a good value compared to other options in Key West.

We picked Sebago over Danger Charters because Sebago is cheaper by $20 p/person and are awesome; both companies offer same excursions.

The noise comes from other rooms where drunk people reside as well as from the Harbor Walk (boardwalk), which is close to the hotel where drunk people walk around at night. It was hard to sleep as a result. In particular, if you plan to sleep past 7 a.m., forget about it. Other residents, especially those with children, will make sure you are up bright and early every morning. I was very disappointed with the resort's \"private beach.\" Yes, they have one--if you consider a twenty foot by 20 foot swath of sand to be a private beach. In addition, the area of water you can then swim in is also very small. It is sectioned off about 50 feet from shore. I would guesstimate you can swim in the ocean for about a total of 100 square feet. It is very shallow in this area, however, so you can't really swim. I should have more properly said you can WADE in the ocean for about a total of 100 feet. Plus, every morning, there is a ton of seaweed washed up on the private beach. It takes maintenance about 2 hours to clean all of it. So, you can't really use the \"private beach\" until about 11 a.m. Then, it is populated mainly by small children who make a lot of noise. So, if you are an adult who just wants to lay out there and relax, forget about it. The rooms were of average cleanliness. I found 2 hairs while I was there (that were not my own)! This is a condominium complex, not a hotel. Therefore, maid service is very limited. All they did for us was exchange towels and put new sheets on the bed every day. They did not clean the shower or anything else. And, when they dumped out our trash, they didn't even change the bag. So, all the stickiness from the trash stayed in the bag, and by the end of our week's stay, the trash really stunk. Furthermore, they charged me for a pool towel I never used. I tried to explain that there was a mistake, but the staff was unwavering. Speaking of the pool, however, I will say that the highlight of my week at the resort was pool-side bingo (yes--that was the highlight at that resort if that tells you anything). Everyday, there is bingo that starts at 2 pm and which is played by the pool. It is $5 for five games, and you win $30 for the first 4 games and about $150 for the final black-out game. I won once all week, but it was fun. This resort has a good location insofar as it is right on the marina. It is a \"good\" location if you like looking at boats in the water, but not if you want to swim or snorkel. For those things, you will inevitably have to find a public beach or pay a private charter to take you out to the reef. There were other resorts that had much larger private beaches that would have allowed us to do those activities on resort property. This resort, unfortunately, did not. The resort has a concierge who will make reservations for you for any activities you want to do on the island. However, there is just one of her and many guests who want her attention. Therefore, you have to wait a long time if you want to talk to her. If you have a busy day planned and expect to be in-and-out to see her and then get on with your day, forget about it. Allocate at least half an hour for every time you want to talk to her. And, the discounts she can provide are not that substantial. Furthermore, she will pressure you to buy a time-share there. Even if you tell her you are not interested, expect to be told about it all week, every time you see her. There are lounge chairs on a private boardwalk belonging to the resort that you can relax on and look at boats in the water. Unfortunately, most of this boardwalk is right in front of their \"Tiki Bar.\" So, you have drunk men staring at you for most of the day if you sit out there, and it is loud. The Tiki Bar's patrons tend to be over the age of 60 and, especially at night, it tends to be frequented just by men who seem like heavy drinkers. It was not an amenable place to socialize.", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longwood, FL", "Title": "\u201cExcellence in paradise\u201d", "Author": "pairagators", "ReviewID": "UR27045288", "Content": "We thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of our stay at the Galleon Resort.

I wanted to rent a small boat to run out to the reef and snorkel and then head to the sandbar and relax and have a cocktail. The winds were blowing hard at 20 to 25 on Sunday and were scheduled to lay down a bit on Tuesday. My sister and I were referred to Galleon boat rentals and visited their kiosk at the marina at Galleon Resort. I explained that I had my own 21 ft boat and I had been a Coast Guard captain for over 15 years and I was concerned about taking their 22 foot rental out in these winds; however, if the winds laid down I would be interest in renting the boat on Tuesday. Keith, the person at the Kiosk, agreed that being safe was the best course of action and he joked that keeping his customers safe increased repeat business. Tuesday morning that winds were already at 20 by the time the marina opened. We showed up 10 minutes after they opened and advised them we would not be renting the boat due to the winds. Keith, the person in charge, agreed the winds were too high and we agreed to shoot for Wednesday. Wednesday morning came and the winds were again at 20 by 9:00am and forecasted to increase to 30. No one in their right mind would take a 22 ft boat out in 30MPH winds. When we called to explain we would not be taking the boat for the day on Wednesday due to the winds, Keith immediately began yelling at me saying he had \"reserved\" the boat for two days and we were obligated to take it. \"reserverd\" is hysterical because there was not one other reservation for the entire day for ANY of his boats for Tuesday or Wednesday. Additionally, why did he agree that 20mph was too much on Tuesday but suddenly 30mph was fine on Wednesday? I think he just got up on the wrong side of the bed, or perhaps he works on commission and realized that the winds were ruining his check for the month. I have no idea what prompted his outburst but it was completely unprofessional and innappropriate. My main concern is that he would send some unsuspecting tourist out in his rental boats in high winds just to make a buck with NO concern for their safety. Fortunately I knew better but what about those northerners who take their lake boats out once a year and think they can handle Key West sand bars and breakers in 30MPH winds?", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, but poor service.\u201d", "Author": "scoop312", "ReviewID": "UR26753575", "Content": "We had one of the penthouse suites.

Overall - if you want a nice clean place to stay in a perfect location, go to the Galleon and have the time of your life.", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay in Key West\u201d", "Author": "FlashOhio", "ReviewID": "UR11509494", "Content": "The Galleon is a gem!

There could be some small updates with the units, but overall we were pleased. The big problem was the night before we left. We came in around 11:30 and the airconditioner was not working, and by this time there wasn't anyone at the front desk. I called security which was listed for emergency. He basically told me that no one would come that late to fix the airconditioner. It was 80 degrees in the room and climbing. It was miserable. We didn't sleep, and my 3 year old coughed all night because he was so hot. I kept calling and finally somerone came an hour before check out time the next morning, and looked at it and left. We were sweating trying to pack our bags, and then they had the nerve to call and rudely tell us that it was ten minutes after ten and we needed to get out. This was the final straw. It is a nice palce to stay with a great location, but beware if you have an issue or problem; don't expect it to be addressed in a timely manner.", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Galleon Resort And Marina", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34345-d224521-Reviews-Galleon_Resort_And_Marina-Key_West_Florida_Keys_Florida.html", "Price": "$287 - $287*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">617 Front Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\">Key West, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33040</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "224521", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/1d/b9/1db9e11832bc281953b54ebae8cd13231large.jpg"}}
