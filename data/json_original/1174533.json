I couldn't believe that others in our group who stayed at the W, actually paid only $10.00 more than we did. It was freezing in my room and because the hotels infracture is so antiquated, maintenance has to physically come into your room to switch the heat on if the guest before you was there during warmer weather. The hotel it's self looks pretty new, but according to maintenance, it's just \"a pretty mask over an old and wrinkled face.\" And then the alarm clocks. I was there during the time change to daylight savings time and wanted to set both the time and alarm on the alram clock before heading. Well I couldn't do that because maintenance has to come up and do that too. I've never had an alarm clock where I wasn't able to change the time or ever had heating/cooling that required a strange man at10:30 PM while in my pajamas to come fix it. And don't even ask me how long it took for him to get to me. He left at 11:00 PM so I had to trust my wake up call which I surprisingly didn't get either. To top it all off, the Front Desk manager Dawnita, didn't even seem to care about my concerns and wasn't the least bid interested in her dissatisfied guest that beat me to the puch. I believe the solution to us both was, \"I know it's frustrating but it's just one of those things that is what it is.\" WOW!!

I requested a quiet room and they found me a room on the courtyard side that was just fantastic. The staff was extraordinarily friendly and during my 4-day stay they frequently greeted me and inquired about my adventures about town. They were quick to answer questions and accommodate a few requests. They even provided SUNSHINE on a couple of days (oh wait, that may not be able to take credit for that....). The location was excellent. I was able to take the light rail from the airport (40 minute ride for under $3? yes please), and then walk 5-6 blocks to the hotel. I rented a car one day from the Hertz counter a block away, and jumping on the interstate was a breeze. The iconic Pike Street Market is an 8 block walk down the hill, and if you walk a few blocks east you're in the heart of the Capitol Hill District with all kinds of food and shopping. The convention center is located next door, and a very unique urban park built over the interstate provides a fantastic place to escape is integrated into the landscape with remarkable precision. A delightful bonus that I enjoyed several times. If you aren't familiar with the Homewood Suites brand, not only do they serve a hot breakfast but also a light dinner Monday-Thursday evenings that is a great deal especially for weary business travelers who might not feel like venturing out at the end of a long day. One last thing for people who ARE familiar with the Homewood Suites brand. Many of the properties I've stayed at have a more \"country home\" feel to them in terms of decor and layout..this place is very classy and reminded me more of their \"Hilton Garden Inn\" sister brand within the Hilton brand family.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sierra Vista, Arizona, United States", "Title": "\u201cnot one complaint\u201d", "Author": "Nathaniel B", "ReviewID": "UR125208812", "Content": "Very clean, polite staff, decent food, comfortable beds, big bathrooms.

We have been on the side street, which had the best balcony of all the rooms. This room has a tiny balcony and essentially no view, only of the small court yard and the apartment next door. It was necessary to keep the curtains closed because we concluded that if we could see the people in the apartments, they could see us as well. This is the first time I have been disappointed with the breakfast. There is usually some type of egg dish and this was a breakfast burrito. I am not a picky eater, but the burrito was dried out, the wrapper crispy and the sausage and egg mixture was greasy and inedible. I gave up after several bites and had the hard boiled eggs and a banana. The coffee is consistently good and I love the flavored creamer as an option.

Very quiet and relaxing. The staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was typical hotel complimentary buffet style. Ok, but mostly a means of sustenance. The cut fruit each day seemed kind of old. Fortunately they also put out bananas and apples. Location is good. We found it close enough for walking to a variety of attractions and restaurants (we like to walk). The farthest we went was the Pike street market for lunch one day which was probably a 30 minute walk. Parking is pricey, but typical of a downtown metro hotel.

Everything was clean and nice, and our suite had plenty of space for our toddler to run around. Having a kitchen in the city was great as well. For the most part I would recommend the hotel, but there were a few things that irked me: 1. The do no offer self parking and charge $32/day for valet parking in a garage that is directly attached to the hotel. I don't understand why they can't allow customers to park themselves, but if they have a good reason then they should not use this as a means to take advantage of customers and charge such a high rate. I'm not a valet fan as I don't feel I should have to make a phone call ahead of time to access my vehicle, or wait around for it. Further, the valet was in such a hurry to get our car parked that he drove off without asking us if we had everything, and I had to then call to have groceries (!) and my cell phone charger brought to the room. So I paid $32/day plus taxes for alot of inconvenience. If you're brining a car you may want to consider another hotel. 2. Upon check-in, they asked if I had a room preference. I told them I was not familiar with the hotel and asked what they would recommend. The girl, who was new, checked with someone else more knowledgeable and they put us in a second floor corner room near the freeway. To correct from other reviewers, the noise issue is not the freeway but is from Pike Street. In the living room portion it was very loud and we considered moving. We ultimately decided not to, however, as our bedroom has a tree outside which made a big difference in noise. 3. The refrigerator was stuck in an area not quite larger enough, so you could only open the door about a foot. Otherwise the hotel is nice, but the valet parking thing really irks me and I do think they should address the noise issue in certain rooms better as it appears to be a regular complaint. They did add the nice touch of leaving ear plugs in the bedroom, which I appreciate as it shows they are willing to think outside of the standard chain procedures to satisfy a customer issue.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane", "Title": "\u201cSide street quieter\u201d", "Author": "xterrared", "ReviewID": "UR118885248", "Content": "We have 3 prior stays with this hotel, all on the street facing the freeway.

Great location, groovy room, low price, helpful staff, yummy breakfast...dude, just book this thing already! You can walk to just about everything from here: Pike Place Market; the monorail to the Space Needle; nice stores (and Ross!); cool restaurants; the waterfront; and the art museum without having to walk through any janky neighborhoods.

My wife and I are in our fifties and, after a full day of walking around town, we freakin leapt like gazelles back up to the hotel. It's uphill but not a big deal at all, certainly not worth mentioning unless someone is terribly out of shape (might be time to get a Rascal). The rooms are BIG and full of great stuff! (get it? \"Big\" is in caps to emphasize the big-ness) By great stuff , I mean free wi-fi, big flat screen, and a kitchenette that has everything but the....wait a minute...INCLUDING the kitchen sink!

Oh my, the bed was so comfortable I was down and out quicker than Old Yeller. I can't really comment on the noise factor as we actually enjoyed throwing open the windows and letting that cool Seattle air and the hum of the city lull us to sleep. That's how we roll. A free breakfast buffet,(delicious and nutritious) and a free dinner Monday through Thursday, including (you're gonna love this) free beer and wine. Ahhhhhh. Check this out. On the day we left to board our cruise, we didn't realize all the cabs in the city were booked, as several ships board and depart on the same day. The guy at the front desk says, \"let me see what I can do.\" He makes some phone calls and gets us a stretch limo for the price of a cab! Five minutes later, it arrives and we're on our way.

The sofas all come with a pull-out full-sized bed, and there is always a separate room with a Queen or King-sized bed.

As a side note, on the fourth time, I complained and was offered 5,000 HHonors points as a courtesy. I welcomed that offer, however, I have not seen the points credited to my account of this writing.

One night they had cod, veggies and breadsticks and another night they had pulled pork sandwiches, potato salad and corn nuggets. They always have a little salad bar, the fixings for PB&J sandwiches and tasty cookies. The food isn't top notch but what can you say, it's free! The rooms were as expected and the beds were sufficiently comfy. It's nice to have the little kitchen with full-size fridge and freezer. You can borrow a DVD player for free for the TVs. There is also a pool which is ICE COLD, so you can't use it too many days, but there is a Jacuzzi to make up for it, and a billiards room which we didn't get to check out. The location of the hotel is very convenient, it is only a short (downhill) walk to Pike's Place, and there is a Subway and Cheesecake Factory just minutes down the street. It's also right in the middle of a huge shopping district, so you don't even have to take the car to go to GameWorks, American Eagle, Gap, Old Navy, H&M or any of the other big stores there. We returned our rental car a day early and walked to the shopping area on our last day. It was nice not having the pressure of \"we have to go back to return the rental car\"! My only complaints other than the freezing pool is that about 3 or 4 times during our stay the keys for both our rooms (aunt, uncle, cousins, grandma and immediate family of 4 require at least 2 rooms) didn't work, so we had to go down to the lobby to have them re- validated, and since both rooms were reserved under one name, there were some mix-ups and confusion over that.

We were on the 9th floor so maybe we were above the noise. The rooms (full kitchen including dishwasher, living room, bedroom and bathroom separate from the bedroom) were all spacious and nicely appointed. Lots of storage with two full closets and two dressers. A full breakfast is available every morning with plenty of hot and cold choices and good fresh fruit. The hot entrees changed every day so you don't have to eat the same thing each morning. Also the free dinner Monday- Thursday was substantial, well balanced and pretty good. Did I mention free wine or beer is also available with dinner? As for location, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a three blocks up-hill from the downtown action but we saw this as a plus - it's only three blocks to lots of stores and 9 blocks straight down the hill to Pike Place Market, yet away from the chaos. The convention center is in the next block down from the hotel. Another reviewer said they didn't think this was the best neighborhood, but as two women traveling by ourselves, we felt perfectly safe. In fact, we thought that crime is probably low around the convention center because it's not in the city's interest to have conventioneers be victimized by crime. The only negative thing I can come up with after a 7 night stay is that one morning one of the two elevators was broken so it was an adventure getting to and from the lobby. But again that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one minor gripe during the course of the week, while I have high praise for everything else. I will definitely book here again. By the way, you can skip renting a car if you stay here unless you want to drive out of town. The light rail link from the airport stops about 5 blocks away, and it's a breeze to take to and from the airport. If you go down-hill two blocks you can catch the busses for free through most of downtown from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. Just Google the free bus zone and print out the map to see where you can go for free. Also bus 99 runs for free all along the waterfront, near the Space Needle, to the Art Museum, Pioneer Square and China Town, so you don't even have to change busses to get to most of the places on a tourist \"Must Do\" list.

I paid it and as soon as we finished checking out, the valet returned on foot saying he could not get our car started. At this point, I was a bit irritated. So I grabbed the keys and hauled our stuff out to the car myself and we left. When I installed the club on the steering wheel, the wheel lock had engaged which also locks the ignition.

I immediately called to get a different room as we need two beds, and I prefer a tub. I was told that there was a U2 concert and there were no rooms available to me so they sent up a roll-away. I was going to make the most of it and went on about my vacation. The next morning my daughter told me the bed was very uncomfortable with ha huge spring right in the middle of her back.

It is literally street level with all the noise of trucks, cars, emergency vehicles, and tourist running up and down the street. There is a door to a patio that had a paddle-lock on it.

Within 5 minutes of arriving and 30 minutes of leaving the hotel my daughter realized she left her wallet in the nightstand drawer. I called and was put through to a voicemail, I left a detailed message with all my contact info. Never got a call, never had anything acknowledged, nothing.

We used the shuttle extensively (another hotel even told us NO Seattle hotel has shuttles) and the two shuttle drivers were helpful, friendly, and went out of their way to help us. Don't know if it's because we tipped every time, but I have a feeling they're just good guys. The food was wonderful - not haute cuisine but for a family on a budget with three little children and a grandmother, it worked out well for us. Gave us a portable crib when we asked. Took care of our luggage. Beds and sheets and pillows were very comfortable. The sofa bed was very uncomfortable but I've never slept on a comfortable one before. The windows did seem like they were open because they didn't seem to seal well but we did not hear outside noise, just a sort of hum from life outside which actually helps our children sleep better. A couple nights we heard sirens for a few seconds. One morning we got an apology for the fire alarm going off the night before but we were never disturbed any of our nights (and my husband is a pretty light sleeper) and certainly never heard a fire alarm. Even higher end hotels like the Hyatt have kept us up with noise from the hallway and other guests but we never heard a thing. Coffee is wonderful. Wifi worked well and no other place we stayed at during our trip in Seattle, Vancouver or Alaska had free wifi and the wifi you paid for was much worse than Homewood's speed. So many of their amenities are free as well, that it took a little adjustment with our other two hotels on our trip. Probably the best endorsement came from my children who kept asking us to go back to the Homewood, even after staying at a higher end hotel in Vancouver (snobby, not so helpful, more crowded) and a cruise ship! This is the place we'll stay at if we ever are in Seattle again, and we've recommended it to my sister to recommend to her friends as she lives in a suburb of Seattle. I like businesses that aren't afraid to ask people to give feedback on public sites and their own surveys because they are truly out to be a good hotel. None of the other hotels we stayed at cared about what we thought. This hotel did while we were there and when we came back.

We arrived midmorning and were pleased to have our suite available. Nice views from the 9th floor (have to change elevators at the 8th floor and find the elevator to the 9th down the hall a bit). We were impressed with the room layout: one bedroom with a king, white duvet, wall-mounted tv, separate bathroom with the best showerhead ever, living room with a sofabed for me (pretty comfy), large flat-screened tv mounted over the fireplace, desk with ergonomic chair, kitchen with dishes, as well as coffee, tea, popcorn. The closet in the living room is huge. There was a balcony as well... though the weather didn't make it that inviting while we were visiting. Loved the 5-7 pm reception with wine, beer, and much more food than I've ever experienced at such a venue. There were even fresh baked cookies besides the meatball sandwiches and salad bar one night. Morning breakfast is varied, with fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, hot food selections (one morning it was scrambled eggs, sausage patties, potatoes, make your own waffles with fresh strawberries and whipped cream, as well as the usual juices and coffee. Several employees are constantly refilling and cleaning, all very gracious and helpful. Brandon, the food service manager was working as hard as everyone, making sure guests were satisfied. Kudos to the front desk, too. Scotty the driver dropped me off at Westlake Center where I caught the light rail to SEA-TAC for my flight home.

I choose this hotel because it was near the Convention Centre, could offer a suite for the week, had breakfast, a workout room, and high-speed internet. In essence I was looking for a little 'home & office away from home' for a week. My experience was okay but I am by no means blown away by this place. It was comfortable and clean, and the front desk staff were consistently very cheerful and helpful. The food was not to my particular liking... the breakfasts were substantial but offered extremely limited 'healthy' options. Lots of eggs and bacon or sausage. Waffles were always available. Bowls of fruit salad and (during the week only...why?) yogurt. But for healthy options there was only cold items... yogurt & fruit, cold cereal and (to their credit) skim milk. There were 'some' packets of regular oatmeal available, but these disappeared quickly so if you came down after 7 am on weekdays, all that was left was the sugary flavours. Coffee was prolific, some herbal tea offerings would have been nice. Weekday Dinners were clearly pre-packaged. I had looked forward to having salmon one night, only to find prepacked salmon 'blocks' on display. Ugh. Salad was offered every night but it was the bagged, grocery store kind that was very bland. Some different greens would certainly have helped because other vegetable offerings were very, very limited. Having the beer and wine available was good, though I didn't try any of it myself. In general, I found the food clearly catered to those wanting to 'bulk up' on lots of breads, potatoes and meats, with very limited healthy options provided at either the breakfasts and dinners. For me, this was a disappointment. The workout room, though small, was great! After the first day, I didn't try to go any time during the morning as there was no way to get on a machine. It was open 24 hrs, which I liked as my jetlag allowed me to get there early (5 am!) on some days. However getting on a machine between about 6 and 9 am was iffy. For cardio there are two treadmills, two steppers, and a recumbant bike. There are also balls and weights. I liked that there were individual tvs for each machine. Water, towels, usual cool room were very welcome. I had no need for the business centre as I was pretty self-contained. But they did have a couple of terminals and a printer available. It was in quite a public area, so probably would not be suitable for someone wanting to work for more than a few minutes. I stayed on the 9th floor - they called this the ``executive floor`. I am not sure why. To get there you had to go up to the 8th floor, walk down the hall and around the corner and take another elevator up to the 9th. It seemed a long and convoluted walk for nothing. Running downstairs to grab a cup of coffee turned into a frustrating process. There was also no way to access the lobby from the stairwells. So I couldn`t even run down the stairs for a break. Instead I ran down to the second floor, then had to take an elevator. I suppose that there are some security issues behind this... but it just seemed odd. The room was spacious and well equipped with full kitchen amenities. My room had a breakfast bar but no dining table, which as fine for me but others might not like that. Bathroom was well appointed, clean and updated. The bedroom was small but adequate with a very comfortable bed. The pillows were plentiful - would have been nice to have had some soft vs. hard options on the bed as all the pillows were exactly the same. The heat in the room was somewhat strange. Heat only came into the living area, so the bedroom got very cold if you didn`t leave the door open. I like cool rooms so again this was okay with me but others might not like this. I liked the location of the hotel because it was in walking distance of everything. They offer a shuttle around the downtown but I didn`t use it. It was only a 10 minute walk up to the grocery store, 5 minutes to the convention centre, and another 10 minutes down to the central downtown. So I liked being able to take a break and go for a walk. It was also very close to a major bus station so it was easy to catch an express bus anywhere in the city. The downside of the location is that it is noisy. Very, very noisy. I faced away from the freeway but could still hear it. And on Friday & Sat nights the sirens were incessant. I barely slept at all. While the hotel does provide earplugs, they didn`t much help. The building just seemed poorly soundproofed and I don`t know how you can fix that. But it did sound like the emergency vehicles were parked right outside my window over and over, all night long. So during the week the sound was acceptable, on weekends it was a nightmare. Finally, when I got my bill, it seems that the hotel charged me a lot per night for the first few nights, then less on the weekend. Very confusing! Perhaps it was a discount for the longer stay, but it seems that I paid an extra $25 per night during the week for the dinner. To me, this is absolutely not worth the money. Overall I would recommend this hotel, but only during the week and suggest that the dinners might not be worth the extra cost unless you have young men or teenagers in your party that can take advantage of the bulkier food offerings.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocean Shores, Washington", "Title": "\u201cAnother nice stay\u201d", "Author": "dmills1956", "ReviewID": "UR103658490", "Content": "We stayed here April 7th to the 10th while attending a conference at a nearby hotel.

I returned to my car to find the three kids outraged and angry over comments the valet made to them in our car. He asked my kids if they smoke weed and if they had been smoking it in the car with their mom! My kids were shocked and more than a little put out. They denied it completely.. my kids DO NOT use drugs. He then insistently asked them again, and again. They were very mad. We parked the car and I spotted the valet in the garage. I asked him why he was talking to my kids and accusing them of smoking pot.

We had a king suite for our family of 5. My 3 young kids shared the sofa bed in the living room. We found the room spacious and well appointed. The bathroom is good sized with Neutrogena bathroom products. The kitchen has a microwave, stovetop, fridge and dishwasher and enough kitchen supplies to cook and serve a basic meal. You can hear street noise, but not enough to be bothered. The hotel provides ear plugs if it is an issue... it wasn't for any of us. The location of the hotel was great for exploring the city. It was about a 10 minute was to the Pike St Market and first Starbucks. Just up the hill (within view of the lobby) is Victrola Cafe which was a favorite coffee stop of the locals we were in town visiting. Up another 10 minutes was Molly Moons Ice Cream, and a great Capitol Hill park (did not catch the name), and some other neat local shops. The monorail is about halfway between the hotel and Pike's, making it very accessible for visiting the Experience Music Project/ Sci Fi Museum. We drove out to explore other areas such as Wallingford, Ballard, Greenlake, Queen Anne and did not find it hard to navigate the city starting from the hotel. The locals we were visiting recommended not hanging out in the area of the hotel at night, which was not an issue for us as we had both young children (making for early nights) and a car (which kept us off the street when we were out at night). But for people looking to enjoy the nightlife and planning on walking vs. cars or cabs this may be a consideration. During the day the area was fine and you will see a mix of tourists, families and business people. Continental breakfast was comparable to other Homewood Suites and better than many other chains. Instead of just cold cereal, pastries and fruit, you can expect eggs, bacon or sausage, french toast, waffles and potatoes in addition to the usual staples. Breakfast can be crowded, and it took a few minutes to find tables, but the staff was great about bussing tables quickly and keeping food restocked. I am not a huge breakfast person so I stuck to coffee, but it was a great value to have all 3 kids start their day with plenty to choose from to keep them happy and full bellies. Parking at the hotel was around $28 after taxes. This may seem high but coming from CA I am used to the $30-$50 parking prices that come with SF and LA hotels, so it didn't bother me. Overall I felt the value was great. We did the prepay deal on the Homewood Suites website which gave us a 20% discount off the room (no cancellations or changes however). So our total including parking, taxes and fees was still well under any local comparable hotel for a suite for a family of 5. The one negative was that signs were posted in the hotel advertising a grand opening of the hotel pool. We went up to the 5th floor, saw the pool and people enjoying it, confirmed the hours with staff in the lobby, and promised our kids we would enjoy it in the afternoon after touring the city. When we went back in the afternoon (dressed in our swimsuits and the kids VERY excited to swim) the pool was closed (and remained closed the rest of our stay) and the hotel would only say they had not meant to open it. This caused a slight meltdown among our already tired children, since we'd been talking about the pool all day. Once the pool is truly open this will add additional value to what is already a great hotel. I would stay there again easily.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBest of the Best\u201d", "Author": "crosbieclan", "ReviewID": "UR70819568", "Content": "If you want service at a great hotel for a reasonable price this is the place to stay in Seattle.

It would have been nice to buy fresh crab, fish, fruits, and vegetables from the market . There is a fitness center with a stationary bike, treadmill, elliptical machine, and benches for free weights. The billiards room is fun and has a leather couch with tv. They serve a generous breakfast, so the dining area was bustling around 9:30 am. The business center has two computers and is in the dining area. They provide free rides in the Homewood van, which is a Ford Flex. There are several drop-off points, including the International District and the Public Market, but they pick you up where they dropped you off. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk down to the Public Market. There are lots of shops and Starbucks along the way. The hotel provides umbrellas if you need one.

He handled many different tasks and guests, sometimes several at the same time and always with a smile on his face. He went the extra mile to make sure as guests were well taken care of. He is a jewel and the hotel is so very fortunate to have him. This man will go far in the hospitality business and will be a definite asset to the hotel. Phala at the front desk was amazing and I watched her handle the many guests arriving or leaving all at the same time with a calm, professional and friendly manner. Never did she look stressed or anxious. She also is a definite asset to the hotel. I also want to mention Danielle, Terry, Scott and Timmy who were outstanding in their jobs. This hotel runs very well and their employees work together as a team, something you don't see very often anymore. I thanked as many people as I could for helping our family reunion be the special event it was.

Our room faced I-5 which didn't bother me. It was actually kind of nice to have a little white noise to sleep with. If vehicles drving at high speed bother you, bring some Ambien. I rarely heard sirens and was never woken up by the street noise. It was very comfortable to sleep here. We were by the elevators and I never heard a sound. The happy hour was a nice snack. I wouldn't really want to eat a full meal here. Seemed like Trader Joe's frozen food and salad in a bag. But not bad for a hotel happy hour. Beer on tap was Miller Lite. I went to The Pike at Pike Place Market for beer instead. They had a couple of wines but I didn't look at the selection. Breakfast was what you would expect from a hotel breakfast.

About a ten minute walk to Pike Place Market. If you're in town for a convention, the convention center is about a block away. The monorail station is four or five blocks away so it was easy to get to the Space Needle and EMP. The hotel shuttle took us to a Marniers game so we saved on transportation to the game. Lots of restaurants a few blocks away. My only complaint about the location is that there seemed to be a large amount of homeless in Seattle. This is obviously no fault of the hotel. Pretty much anywhere you stay around here, you will encounter them. I also noticed a shocking lack of police presence. Even saw a drug deal go down outside the convention center.

I plugged in the price I wanted to pay and where and Priceline gave me Homewood Suites on Pike St. The hotel was very easy to find from the I-5 and valet immediately parked my car. Check in was at 4:00 pm but I arrived just before 2 and didn't have a problem. My room was amazing: it was literally bigger than my current apartment. It had a full kitchen, full living room with work space, large bathroom and nice size bedroom with a king size bed, not to mention two flat screen tvs. I didn't have much of a view, but I didn't really spend that much time in my room. Some people may have found Boren St a bit noisy so you might request a quieter part of the hotel. It didn't affect me. The suite was updated and the hotel lobby was quite stylish for a 3 star hotel. It looked like it had been renovated within the past 3 years. There was a note in the bathroom saying if you forgot any essential toiletry item they would be happy to provide you a complimentary replacement, which I thought was a nice touch. As well, after I had been out for the day, the front desk called my room and asked if everything was to my liking. It seemed like everyone who worked here really liked their jobs. I used the shuttle service a few times and it was quick and reliable. But downtown Seattle is small enough that you can pretty much walk everywhere. Breakfast was much more substantial than I think most guests are used to: cereals both hot and cold, a variety of pastries, bagels, bread, fruit as well as some hot items. I would have liked to see a bit more on the lighter side of fare, but they are appealing to the masses, not to special dietary needs. I was fine. I didn't leave hungry. As well, the Welcome Home reception was a nice concept. It was nice if you didn't feel like trying to locate a restaurant in the area that appealed to you.

Homewood (now a Hilton after being called Pike Place Suites and Summerfield under previous nameplates) quite simply was the best overall value we could find, and WE really knew where and what to look for. Its location is outstanding for walking, exploring and being right in the thick of the things most really want to \"see\" in Seattle. And if you need to go further, it's ideally situated to do it from. \"Top Marks\" for: Front Desk friendliness/knowledge, Engineer (we had a door lock glitch, so they gave us a quick upgrade 'til getting the room back open), Location (They are easy off I-5 and away from a lot of the one-way hassles of downtown) besides their valet during the week you may get lucky like us and find free parking across the street - from late Saturday through Sunday when meters are off) they're one block from the Wa State Conv Ctr if that's of interest, and only 3 blocks or so from the Regal Theater complex and literally scores of great local and chain restaurants and shops. Finally, it's a straight shot right down Pike about 9 easy blocks to the Pike Place Market \"pig\" entrance. \"Good Job\"s for: Rooms (a bit tired, but nice kitchens, baths, furnishings and comfy Hilton beds), Exercise Room with water cooler, towels, TV and some weights, plus 2xTreadmills, 2xEllipticals, 1 Recumbent Bike - all NEW Precor with Cardio Theater TV's and near-pro gym quality) \"Hot\" Breakfast (better than Denny's but not quite up to Embassy Suites standards - but the price- Free - was right!), Shuttle Service (we didn't use but it was a great itinerary and they were flexible about pick-ups until around 9 pm. Great if you are tired after walking all over the city. Biggest Surprise: The price, just over $100 incl. tax for an admittedly quiet night, just after New Year's. The Last Words...This is a great place to stay if you want a quiet and close-by hotel to kick back (even play pool in their lounge!), with a weekday manager's reception, and to keep some food, drink around your room (big fridge, a microwave and a stovetop, plus a coffee maker and the bonus - Starbucks coffee always hot in the lobby, incl. real creamer. You can buy munchies from their quick selection but there are markets everywhere, including a fairly close QFC supermarket up on Capitol Hill, a mini mart by the Conv. Ctr. and a nice IGA with decent wine prices right down on 3rd Ave. off Pike. If you want to work out and not pay extra, it's a 24-hour fantastic value - so pick the \"off-times\" to avoid any crowds and get a real workout incl. in your room price. Or just head down the hill, to Pike Place, Pioneer Square, or the waterfront. You'll be walking lots, especially back up the hill to the hotel, but there's lots of food and drink along the way to cure what \"ales\" you... \"Top Tips\" nearby from a Local \"Tourist\": Pike Place Pub for beer and magnificent crab-stuffed Salmon filet. Everything's wild, food is best quality, beer brewed there has won awards. McCormick and Schmick's...great drinks, consistently better seafood, reasonable wine list values. Key Lime Pie that is more like cheesecake but puts others to shame!

We were told to call back and find out if the room gets done sooner. I wish he had offered to call us instead as we were brand new in the city. However that didn't stop us from spending our entire day exploring downtown, walking down the Pike place market and also did the duck tour. When we got back we were greeted with smiles by 2 young ladies. Our room was clean, spacious, facing the street ( as we requested) and had a crib for our toddler. They served breakfast every morning which was really fresh and tasty and I am talking about 'real' breakfast. They had scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, milk, cereal, fruits, yogurt, coffee and more. I mean do we every go in such detail every day to prepare our breakfast at home. I thought that was great. The staff was super friendly right from the maids, to front desk, to shuttle driver to managers themselves. They have a laundry and a suite shop. They have a reception light dinner every evening. My husband and I thought the light dinner every night with wine and beer was the best touch ever. We loved how managers would interact with guest and be there for dinner. It was a different meal every day. After working all day my husband loved to unwind with a glass of cold beer. It worked out really good for us because with a toddler we couldn't venture out for dinner every night for 6 days. This was a fun way for us to enjoy ourselves in the comfort of our hotel. The hotel had a shuttle service which took guests to main tourist spots. I used it a few times during the day when my husband was gone to take my baby to the aquarium and children's museum. Our 5 day stay at Homewood suite was one of our best stays ever in any hotel. We travel a lot both domestic and international but never have experienced such great service. I may be wrong but one night for dinner reception the GM Greg was hosting it. He was very nice and friendly and we talked about some restaurants and cupcake shops. I thought it was very nice of a GM to be a part of his hotel team that way ( that is if he was the same Greg) My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the hotel and even my super friendly toddler felt at home, She got smiles and compliments from all the staff members and I thought yes this sure is a kid friendly hotel :) I would recommend this hotel to any friend or family and can vouch for it.

We had a beautiful suite with stunning views of Seattle. Add to this the gracious and superb staff to get a truly WOW effect. The front desk staff greeted us by name when we left the hotel and when we returned they greeted us by saying \"welcome home\". The staff recommended great restaurants, not just any restaurants but ones where they had eatten which really made it even more inviting thanks so much to Priscilliana, Selena, Anthony, Jay, Jeremy, Megan and Belinda for all the great recommendations of restaurants, places to shop and even directions to the post office. And a great big thanks to all the other staff who we may not know your names but we will never forget your smiling faces and the excellent service we received during our stay. During the times when we just did not feel like walking down to Pike's Market or other areas of downtown Seattle all we had to do was let the front desk know and wait in the lobby for either Kelvin, Scott or Pete to let us know when it was time to go. Thanks guys for all the rides. A great big thanks to the entire staff for truly excellent services which has become almost extinct except for Homewood Suites by Hilton on Pike Street, Seattle, WA.

I was staying on points so I needed to stay at a Hilton so I said, \"Ok, so it won't be perfect.\" But what a surprise. The location of course is great. I asked for an inside room, I got a huge suite with a deck and full kitchen and balcony overlooking an inside courtyard. Must have just been remodeled. Granite counter tops, seven pillows on my bed, fireplace, flat screen TV in the living room, very modern. The weather was perfect in Seattle but the room so nice I just wanted to hang out in the room. I didn't - but almost wished for a rainy day. Plus, this was the only hotel in the world that I have stayed that the valet parking actually worked well.", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cLove this hotel and location.\u201d", "Author": "VikeFanFJ", "ReviewID": "UR40134609", "Content": "This was my 2nd stay at this hotel and it was great.

It was about a 20 minute walk to Pike Place Market and about 15 minutes to the Space Needle. So, if you're looking to be right in the thick of the city with enless options right outside your door, this may not be the right place. However, being a little off the side, this neighborhood, which is near trendy Queen Anne, is a slightly more relaxed, neighborhood-feeling location. The room was good. It was large, roomy, and pleasant but unremarkable. Definitely a good value in what tends to be a very expensive city for hotels. The most outstanding feature of the hotel was the staff! When I arrived, the room I was supposed to be in was not ready. So, the extremely helpful front desk clerk not only worked very quickly to resolve the situation but offered a significant room upgrade. And, most importantly, I felt that he truly took pride in his business establishment and was willing to work to ensure that my needs as a customer were met.", "Date": "August 16, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Homewood Suites Seattle Convention Center Pike Street", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60878-d1174533-Reviews-Homewood_Suites_Seattle_Convention_Center_Pike_Street-Seattle_Washington.html", "Price": "$135 - $261*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1011 Pike Street</span>, <span class=\"extended-address\">Corner of Pike Street and Boren Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Seattle</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">WA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">98101</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1174533", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/80/9a/809a4fb343ed0b54d7cb65c81ef996fd5large.jpg"}}
