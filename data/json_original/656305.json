{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Newly Renovating But Great Stay. I recently stayed at this inn and I was happy to say that even though they were still renewing some of the furnishing  things around the 90 rooms, that the room I stayed in, was perfect for me  for my stay. Also with the advantage of the 24hr lobby that was great as my flights  luggage were delayed due to weather, so I checked in, in early morning with no problem.The staff were really excellent . The room I was in, was clean, tidy  with fridge ,micro wave and air con, ( all which were clean also )all worked. The Bed Linen was clean, bed was comfortable  I have a bad back so it was comfortable for it. The room was freshly painted too  carpet was clean, also no critters running around either. Cleaning of room was done every day.The Inn is situated close to everything I would have liked to see but was unable to do or see due to health at the time of visit. Most things with in a taxi distance or a car if you have one.I would stay again if the opportunity came up for me definitely. For the price I paid it was definitely worth the stay. Besides you only sleep at night in the room and do the business or touristy thing during the day.", "Date": "Jun 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR738492633", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "aussiestranger"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d656305-r17023238-Americas_Best_Value_Inn-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "656305", "Price": "$47"}}
