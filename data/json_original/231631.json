I am an engineer, but appreciate good looking design. This place is definitely designed for form and not function, this is evident mostly in the bathroom. The ultra modern shower made it difficult to take a shower. Ha, there was also a shade covering a completely transparent window between the shower and living room. The kicker is that the shade is operated from the living room, where the window looks out to... I guess you have to trust your roommate! The thing that most surprised me was how large the room was. Maybe I've gotten used to European rooms, but the make pretty good use of the 35 square meter superior double room. We also had issues with our A/C, however the staff addressed it right away, and it was a little better after that, but still not frigid like some places I've stayed. The location is great, we walked into the city several times but also took the Metro (about a minute from Diego de Leon). The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again, however there isn't a pool which was a bummer in Madrid in the summer.", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hillsborough, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cSpacious room - great for a family\u201d", "Author": "A2ZNJ", "ReviewID": "UR128051123", "Content": "The hotel was in a very nice & quiet area of the city - but convenient to get around using the Metro just around the corner.
