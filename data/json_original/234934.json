It's located near the U-Bahn in a great neighborhood that makes you feel like a local rather than a tourist. There's lots to do in the area and what must be the best bartender in Berlin is just around the corner at the Green Door. The rooms have hardwood floors, high ceilings and wonderful old functional (!) windows. While not fancy, they were very nice and certainly worth the price - maybe more. Breakfast was very good and Simone took care of every detail. The owners seemed like old friends - very helpful and actually concerned about our having a good time, not only in their hotel but in the city itself.

I wish my entire German visit had been at the Gunia for 60 euro/night instead of having to transfer after one night to a first class American hotel (to be with my family) which was sterile, sterile, sterile. The Gunia, on the other hand, has a memorably wonderful owner, Simone, (the Hilton provided us with an inept and mendacious concierge) and rooms with 12-15 foot ceilings strung with classically beautiful chandeliers. The breakfast room had a lovely authentically old and Germanic feel to it with delicious German breads, pancetta, ham, cheese, etc. My room was a good size, furnished simply, and sparling clean. My plane arrived at 2 am. Simone, aware of the hideous arrival time, kindly greeted me close to 3 am. The next day, she provided me with an excellent subway map and very precise directions getting me to Sans Souci.

Having been to Berlin a few times I prefer to stay in the Shoneberg area and the hotel is perfectly located near the intersection of Eisenacherstr. and Motzstr., about 10 mins walk to Nollendorplatz U-Bahn. It is fairly typical of a Berlin pension, with rooms coming off a central corridor around a main, shared dining area. Each room is self-contained with its own TV and bathroom and while basic, perfectly comfortable. Breakfast is a highlight; copious and delicious, served by the ever-cheerful Simone and a great way to start the day. Simone is also a very helpful source of assistance and information, providing maps, public transport tickets and guidance on sights to see.

As soon as we arrived Simone spent an hour with us explaining all the important sites of the city, how to get around with the trains, and as it was our first time in Berlin and had arrived without much preparation, her friendly dedication helped us to get the most out of the trip.. her restaurant recommendations were perfect too! One detail which touch touched our hearts is that the owner put flowers in my mother's room, as she knew of her birthday. This hotel is not five star, but it is in a great location, the rooms are basic with charm and very clean. There is TV in the room. And breakfast each morning in the main dining hall is a treat. The house in itself is a charming example of Berlin architecture that has been preserved in excellent condition and adds to the experience of being in Berlin. Nice quiet street. but still centrally located and walking distance to main shops and transport. We enjoyed our stay and if we would have to return, we would stay at Hotel Gunia again, without hesitation. The owners of this hotel live their hospitality for others, they don't just talk about it!

The Hotel Gunia is not the Ritz, nor is it the Dorchester or the Langham, but for what it is you would be hard pushed to beat it. For a clean, comfortable and most welcoming hotel/pension, The Gunia really delivers on all as well as being great value for money. It is on one floor of a quaint and interesting building c1900. Our room was huge with an easy to use shower, washbasin and toilet located in a spotless and efficient unit within the room, towels supplied. Don't worry, oodles of space left. The bed was very comfortable with a new mattress and spotlessly clean linen, an extra pillow was supplied immediately upon asking. The breakfast was produced within 2/3 minutes of arriving in the dining room. Beautifully served by our delightful host Simone, more than enough to set one up for the day. When we arrived. Simone told us that while we were here 'this was our home', it didn't take us long to realise that she most sincerely meant this. Several other guests told us that this was the 3rd, 5th etc time that they had stayed and that they woud be back, well, all we can say is ----- so will we. Located just a few minutes walk from the U-bahn it is easy to get to from Schoenefeld airport and, with our booking confirmation, Simone gave us precise details of just which trains we needed to take to get there and which ticket was the best to buy. This was most thoughtful and, as this was our first visit to Berlin, saved us ages figuring it out for ourselves. A good, fairly central location just a few minutes from the famous Kurfurstendam. Lovely, interesting city.

I chose it because I had stayed there 10 years ago on my only other trip to Berlin and had really enjoyed it. Fortunately nothing had changed, except the hotel had been updated. The undoubted star of this hotel is Simone, one of the owners. Simone does the front of house and she is a natural, speaking a variety of languages, including excellent English, and having the real knack of being both friendly and professional. She is just a delight. The hotel itself is an absolute bargain. It is a two star hotel and so not packed with facilities but it is very clean, the beds are very comfortable, the rooms are spacious, with lovely high ceilings and breakfast is great. I paid E65 a night including breakfast. I stayed in a 3 star hotel in Paris which had only the advantage of a bar fridge over the Gunia, with smaller rooms, and it cost E135. I've stayed at many comparable hotels throughout Euorpe and the Gunia is the best of its type I have found. The hotel is away from some of the action, now that the centre of Berlin has noticeably moved eastwards, but it is well placed for shopping in the old west Berlin and is just 5 mins from the Nollendorf Platz U-Bahn station. The very efficient Berlin public transport can get you everywhere quickly and efficiently. Nollendorf is a pretty gay area and if that is an issue for you then this may not be the place to stay but like all gay areas it is cosmopolitan, has quirky shops and good food. The hotel is on the 1st floor of its building (they are moving into the 2nd floor as well). There are some steep stairs to negotiate and no lift, so do take this into consideration if you have any mobility limitations. I love Berlin. It is a great city and if you have not visited it, then do so, there is so much to see and so much history set against a great and vibrant current culture. If you do go and you are on a bit of a budget, do yourself a favour and stay at the Hotel Gunia!", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cWhat a wonderful way to experience Berlin!\u201d", "Author": "luckyangel", "ReviewID": "UR56584340", "Content": "We had never been to Berlin and originally we were going to book into some chain hotel like the Ibis but I am so glad that we went to Hotel Gunia instead. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed by our lovely hostess Simone. She knew our flight had been delayed in Dublin as she was worried that we had gotten lost. As it turns out we had no problems whatsoever finding the hotel due to her clear directions. She was fantastic at telling us where to go and what to see (as we had done virtually no research before heading to Berlin). Her directions were clear and easy to follow. She even made sure she had given us the right information by checking the local newspaper in case there were changes to the trains or buses (as we discovered is often the case with Berlin public transport). No matter how many questions we asked she was always bubbly and enthusiastic. This friendly service really makes all the difference when you are on a city break. The hotel building dates back to the 19th century and is beautifully restored with respect to its previous design. Apparently it belonged to Freemasons and is therefore decorated as such. The rooms are large and very comfortable. The bathroom was decent and the shower worked well. The breakfast consisted of cheese, ham, a boiled egg and a variety of bread as well as Coffee and Juice. It certainly sets you up for the day. The location was very good. Just a couple of minutes walk from Nollendorfplatz station. Around the corner on Maassenstrasse (I think) were a variety of different restaurants varying from Indian to Greek. I must say the Amarit Indian restaurant was one of the best I had ever been too, Very reasonable and the portions were collosal. Berlin is nice but very different, its not everyones ideal city but we liked it.
