We paid 98 Euros per night, including breakfast. Location: The hotel is located next to the main railways station of Rome. In case you are going to the cruise port (Civitavecchia) or airport, the location of the hotel could not be any better! Please note that the airport busses both to/from Fiuminico and Campiano arrive right in front of the door of the hotel (being roughly half price of the express train to Fiuminico and taking about 1hr and 10 minutes). You can\u2019t have it more convenient. The trains to Civitavecchia and Fiuminico leave from Termini, right next to the hotel. Please be aware that mentioned trains leave from the \u201cfar\u201d train track. Walking with all your luggage, we could make it in 20 minutes. But I would suggest to calculate at least a 30 minute walk if you in average/good condition and have luggage. For sightseeing, you may want to consider taking the metro from Termini. We took the metro from Termini to St. Peter and walked our way back to the hotel from there. Reception: Friendly, helpful and spoke English well. Room: We were here for 2 nights before and after the cruise. The first night we got room 111, which was a large room, very clean. We were very pleasantly surprised. It has a mood light, you can adjust yourself. Comfortable bed and pillos. The 2nd night, we received a room on the 4th floor, which was really small. As we were on a continuing trip, we had 2 large suitcases with us you really have to figure out how to store these in the room. The only possibility is having them on the ground, which decreases the already limited walking space. We booked the same room category for the same price, but wound up with totally different rooms. You may want to communicate with the hotel beforehand in order to secure a larger room. Breakfast: Was very good.

The airport express bus is across the street from the hotel, as is the taxi stable. I would still recommend you contact the hotel about getting a limo to/from the airport. As far as the hotel, nothing special. It is busy, the Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines had a check in desk during our stay. It is more \"American\" than is standard fare in Europe. We stayed here since my wife was a new International traveler so I did not want to be surprised by a classic European hotel, and it was just what I expected.

The multi-colored mood lighting was fun to play with, but all of the walls in the washroom were frosted glass, making turning on the lights for a late night visit feel as though a spot light had been turned on.

While you sit and wait you watch people off the street check in. If you want to feel like a 2nd class citizen then this is the hotel for you! We have never in our lives been treated like this at any hotel. Granted this is a best western so its not a real 4 star hotel by American standards but the service even for a best western from the check in staff was a nightmare and was the worse part of our two week vacation. We booked this hotel as a package with our cruise line. We had two options this more expensive hotel and a lower star cheaper hotel. Of course after paying 12k already for this trip, flight, cruise, and tours we wanted this more expensive hotel for our special vacation. What a joke! The service and treatment you get for this hotel is not worth it. It was so bad we tried to change our 2nd stay at this hotel with our cruise line but couldn't as it was to late. Yes we had to indure the rude check in staff twice! Had to sit in the lobby and watch people check in before us twice! We stayed April 17th and April 29th. My husband asked the first time we checked in why others where being checked in and not us (and the other tourists mostly American from the cruise line) while Italians came in and checked in no issues. This rude RUDE lady named Paola at the front desk told my husband that it was the contract with the cruise line. NO check in till 2PM. First off no one sees this contract till you get to the hotel. They give you the contract then from a rep from the cruise line in the lobby. When he argued with the desk lady Paola saying how he saw others checking in she responded with they had more expensive rooms! Surely this woman was joking as all the rooms are either singles, double, or triple. We had a double (two twins pushed together to make one double size bed) with breakfast and a photographic view room being the 2nd most expensive per night room they have! Not everyone checking in before us Americans where triple bed rooms! My husband called her out and told her she was lying to his face as rooms where obviously open but we where forced to wait after our 15 hour flight. She didn't care no room for us.She didn't care we knew she was lying. She didn't care that rooms where actually open. Finaly as we threatened the cruise line rep stating that we wanted to leave and find a better hotel the cruise rep called her boss to call the hotel and talk to the rude hotel staff. So at 1230 over two hours of waiting we got a room. I don't know of anyone that has ever gone to a hotel and had to endure crazy strict check in times if rooms are open! No hotel does that! I have worked at a hotel before and if a room is open or dirty you call to get it cleaned and get people checked in. Especialy tourists. Well not this place! And dont expect to check out with the other guests at the hotel at 12 PM. If you go with a cruiseline check out is at 10AM! This is per Paola who works the check in desk in the mornings. She doesnt check if you ask to check out like the other people at 12 but just says NO. She must have special powers that allow her to know those things without looking at the computer to see. Just knows how to be rude and say NO and argue with guests. We waited till she left and talked to the nicer men working at night. The night manager looked stunned that we where asking to check out at 12. He kept saying this is normal check out you don't need anything special to check out with everyone else. They let us check out with everyone else at 12. All the information in the hotel, in your room, everything says check out is at 12. Paola of course was sticking to a contract that didnt even match our paperwork from the cruise that had it at even a different time. In her world we where tourist 2nd class citizens that needed to be out of her hotel at 10AM. Wouldnt it make sense to treat everyone the same? EQUAL! Not this place. They seem to have it backwards and treat the tourists like dogs. I have never in my life been treated this way at a hotel with such rudeness from the check in staff. We figured the room cost us atleast 300 if not more with breakfast a night in US Dollars. And this is the sevice we got both times at check in for our money. We spoke to the other cruise group on the bus to the ship about the cheaper hotel they stayed at and no one at the cheaper hotel was treated like that or forced to wait hours to get a room. So basicly I paid more to be treated worse at this hotel. Breakfast if your from the US is not what you would think. Its GROSS. The bacon is like some soggy strange bacon that was not eatable. The eggs not good and the Orange Juice and Milk where bad. We ate the pastrys. Only thing you would want to eat after tasting the other stuff. That was it for breakfast as that was the only non cheaply made bad tasting food. This hotel is located in an area close to everything. You can grab a taxi at Termini station right across the street and take a 12 euro ride to the tourist spots you want to see. That was the only plus at this place. Typical small european rooms. Walls in rooms have scuff marks on them all over. Oh and if you go when its colder like we did no heat! They turn the heat off for spring at this hotel so expect cold mornings. You can turn the AC on in your room but can't make it warmer at night or in the morning. Not a 4 star hotel by American standards. I did leave a comment card and did tell the night manager of the check in rudeness with the staff and issues. So this hotel was left writen comments from us about this. I would suggest from how I saw Americans treated that best for US travelers to stay at a real four or five star by US standard hotels. You might pay more but you wont be left in the lobby waiting all day to get a room, rushed out like your scum in the morning per the attitude of the check in staff, and wont be treated over all like 2nd class. We wont be staying here next spring when we go back. You don't need us Americans at your hotel then you don't need our money! If we are such a bother to you when we go to ask questions at the front desk or check in then don't worry we wont be seeing you next spring!", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cperfect location to termini station\u201d", "Author": "valuetrav", "ReviewID": "UR103258182", "Content": "The Royal Santini was a great place to stay.The room was a perfect size for me and the mrs.modern and stylish decor,helpful staff and breakfast was spot on. it's an ideal location near the termini and although its earmarked as a little unsafe my group and i had no issues over the weekend.its best to have your wits about you at any case in all parts of the city so use common sense and all will be fine.we don't mind walking so getting to the various sites of interest from the hotel was no trouble for us.taxis are cheap so use them as an alternative and public transport is fine also.I would recommend getting a tour of the vatican over any other landmark.we were lucky and just made it on this particular tour(3.30ish) and had the vatican halls almost to ourselves so we ended up getting a very informative and fulfilling afternoon.You get to skip the line if you sign to a tour also and finally there is no point doing this in the morning as you won't get any satisfaction with the masses of people behind you.The area of the trevi fountain is a complete rip off for food and drink.avoid drinking imported beers anywhere as its a license for these bars to charge extortionary prices.i wouldn't recommend eating food after 9pm in certain areas as restaurants tend to morph into cocktail bars/nightclubs so standards slip.our holiday was firstly a disaster but ended up being a great break and i'll explain why.i recommend travel only with hand luggage as the bag handlers went on strike.this effected one of the people in my group.secondly the taxi drivers are a little pushy in front of the train escalators trying to look for business.we got a taxi when heading for home and paid 50euro(4 people) from the hotel so pay no more than that.our intention was always to get the train however so went down the escalotor after receiving a bit of abuse from the taxi rep.be careful when you buy train tickets at the counter.thankfully we had a receipt but the guy sold us out of date tickets so when the inspector came around there was a bit of explaining to do.we were absoulutely disgusted and the inspector said he would investigate this further.in honesty though i believe they are all in this scam.i'd hate to think what would happen if we didn't have the receipt.A bad start to our break but this was soon overshadowed by the hotel and beauty this city has to offer", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redondo Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, convenient location\u201d", "Author": "tamacnab", "ReviewID": "UR100089267", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here last week for five nights.

We are frequent Best Western hotel stayers so, we are used to their usual ammenities. We had to show up about three hours before regular checkin, they were able to give us one of our rooms right away. The room included a video game package which they promptly set up for us. The rooms were really great. They were large for Rome standards. They adjoined by a hallway, which we could close off from the main hallway. One room had a large king bed, the other a king bed with a good sized sofa/couch (not a foldout). Both rooms had minifridges, with items you could purchase if you wanted-they check it daily if you like this option. The bathrooms were very clean and modern. The larger room's bathroom had a tub and a glassed shower. Both rooms had in room safes in the closets, good space in both closets as well. The kids loved the neon color lights which you can change to fit your mood, four choices. At night you can look out to the center patio of the hotel and see all the colored squares it is really great! The location at the termini is fabulous, you can get to the trains, subway or buses in minutes! There is several great kid friendly restaurants in front of and inside the termini, and a grocery store as well. We bought a lot of snacks for the kids there to keep in our room, they have a hot food counter as well. The noises of this area did not bother us in the slightest. There is a terminal in front of the hotel for the SIT buses, which run to both airports, so no need for a taxi or to fight to figure train schedule, January 2011, it was 8 euro per person. It does take about 45 minutes to get to fumicino from the hotel. The breakfast which was included in our rate was great!.

Due to our family requirements, we had requested via direct phone call to the hotel for two connecting rooms and the hotel confirmed the availability accordingly. 2. Booked directly via Best Western web site upon hotel confirmation for our requested room arrangement. 3. Upon arrival, was informed by a RUDE girl at the front desk that the connecting rooms were not available and that they would try to have this sorted out the following day. We were given two rooms located a couple of doors away from each other (we could not accept this as we needed to attend to our two children. Furthermore, it was extremely inconvenient). We were subsequently given a junior suite (that I saw could only just fit two adults and some luggage, much less a family of four with seven luggages) as a compromise for their mistake. I did not accept this. 4. I refused to accept this unreasonable behavior and demanded to see the manager on duty. However none was available. 5. The rude Italian girl could not even express herself in English, she should not be working at the front desk! Imagine working for an American hospitality chain and struggling with BASIC English language. She even insisted that no phone call to the hotel ever took place and glared at me as if it were my fault. So was the phone call just a dream?! 6. Eventually we were attended to by a very helpful guy (Chua) whom spoke perfect English and was also very professional and apologetic due to the situation at hand, which he mentioned was no fault of theirs but did express that the reservation team could have better handled this matter. 7. While all this was happening, some \u201cguys\u201d took advantage of the situation and walked up to our family members and started to distract them by pretending to ask for directions. 8. Meanwhile, we decided to leave this hotel immediately due to the very bad, poor and unprofessional handling of the situation and REALIZED THAT ONE OF OUR BAGS WAS GONE! In summary, beware of this hotel due to the non-existence of neither security personnel nor security control monitoring system, as well as limited staff to adequately serve guests, and is also very vulnerable to undesirable elements due to its close proximity to the train station that ultimately attracts lots of human traffic outside of the hotel entrance (via Marsala).

Can't get any more convenient than that! Also easy walking distance to major tourist sites. Breakfast was standard. Only complaint is that coffee comes from a machine so milk isn't fresh. Instead use the milk intended for the cereal in your coffee. For homemade and good food just around the corner is Trattoria dell' Omo. Restaurant is family owned and run. There is no sign. Look for the menu posted on the door. Try the spinach and cheese ravioli and splurge on the parma ham & cheese appetizer.

I went back later on in the day when we had moved to Milani and asked if a shirt had been found. I'm sure it was just a case of someone checking the room or the lost property and I was quite willing to go to the seventh floor and check the room myself if necessary, as it was my own fault. He was full of excuses and it definitely appeared that he just couldn't be bothered. We went back the next day and there were no problems.

Rooms at the front noisy due to the Airport Coaches arriving and departing at all hours. Ambulance and Police sirens don't help either. Rooms at the back better but only on the higher floors as the air conditioning pipes are around the 2nd floor. 6th floor has coffee making machine but not lower floors. Rooms clean and all linen changed every day (choice of 5 kinds of pillows on offer). Housekeeping and porterage staff excellent. Reception staff really could do with lessons in hospitality - not a greeting or smile between them all week (except for the man with a bad leg - apologies to him for not remembering his name). My wife lost a gift bag in Reception and received absolutely no help whatsoever from 3 reception staff who claimed that there was no Lost Property Room and just checked Reception area. However, 3 days later my wife found the bag on top of the cleaners' trolley. The cleaner explained the policy that anything found was put in Lost Property Room!!! for one day then placed on travelling trolley until claimed. A lot of upset caused by lazy Reception staff who, it appeared, only dealt with problems behind their desk. Breakfast staff left a lot to be desired, too. One of our party had to ask 3 times for coffee machine to be replenished. The rest of us had to contend with some stale bread; no bread; lack of choice of bread; meats and cheese not topped up; tables not cleared nor places reset. A pleasant surprise was the presence of scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage albeit lukewarm because guests insisted on leaving lids up. Rome City Council ought to be ashamed of themselves in not keeping clean the Termini, the main artery Rail, Metro, bus and tourbus station. Bins overflowed at all times of the day. Homeless and drunks throughout the day were even more scary at night. Keep to main streets at night even if it takes a bit longer. The 110 Red Bus is a good system in that you buy a ticket for a day and get on and off anytime you want but be prepared to push and shove. DO NOT take the tour which includes Castlegandolfo and Frascati wine tasting. There is a stop on the tour at a lakeside cafe and this is the only point from which to see Castlegandolfo, the Pope's summer residence. Take your long distance photos at this point as it is the last time you will see it again! You then drive thru the TOWN of Castlegandolfo to Frascati where you will be made to walk up a steep hill to a bar for a glass of Frascati wine and that's it - no tasting, no chance to buy. 39 Euros a head!!!!!!!! Rome itself a delight and not to be missed but take the advice of a previous reviewer and take stout walking boots as the famous cobbles take their toll on your feet. Take in the cinematic 3-D exerience of 2 thousand years of Rome in one hour and be prepard for surprises! Look out for differing coupon leaflets - ours was 9.90 Euros plus free tour book. Trevi by night brilliant. Spanish Steps better by day than night. Don't miss, like some do, the 500-y-o sundial in the Church of Our Lady of the Angels - at one time all the clocks in Rome were set by it. If you want to see a specific site or area then get a taxi as nowhere is that far except sometimes the drivers don't know the way!!!!??? Use State controlled taxis and avoid private hire (sharks). Otherwise the 40 Express to the Vatican a cheap and cheerful trip but be sure to stamp your ticket as there is an instant fine whether you have a ticket or not! When we were there the ticket machine beside the CasteldeAngelo was broken all week so we took a chance and had a thrill ride home! Public Transport timetables are available at the Termini for the confident. If taking in the Papal Mass and Blessing - no Tour needed (40 Express) - make sure you take hat and water as you are a long time in the sun. You can also refill bottles at running water fountains nearby, not fountains with reused water. Lunchtime in Rome is just that - lunch. If you just want a beer then some places serve you inside and reserve outside tables for lunchtime trade. So ask first to avoid the embarrassment of being moved on - like us!!! All food tastes are catered for including McDonald's. You pays your money and you takes your choice! Don't forget the inevitable bowl of bread which is charged for whether you eat it or not! Just ask them to take it away to avoid this. All the other sites are well documented but be prepared to queue. The Vatican queue is extremely daunting but you can be inside in half an hour! All in all, an unforgettable experience. I wish you safe journeys and happy holiday.

The air conditioning was not adequate for the heat of the day--in fact, it seemed it was turned off during the evening hours even though the fan remained on. The staff was fine, but a few were a bit testy when you tried to speak Italian and didn't quite say it correctly. The area was a little seedy by the termini. A great bakery was just a block over and it was easy to walk to a few Piazzas in the evening. The food at the hotel was good.
