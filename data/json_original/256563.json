The showers are cracked and mouldy. Some of the rooms are so hot because the air-conditioning doesn't work too well. There's no mini bar in your room. There's no room service for meals. I went down to the restaurant for dinner and was told that they were only serving meals at the bar, however I could then carry my meal and sit at a table in the restaurant!

My company was charged $330 for my room - daylight robbery - when the last time I stayed in Sydney, it cost $250 at the Radisson for a stunning room. Firstly, the rooms do not have curtains, they have horrible rattan-type blind things that look like they've been pulled out of someone's garden shed. The night light pours in so the room never gets sufficiently dark. The duvet on the bed was a threadbare excuse for one and in the cupboard was a hard old-fashioned blanket that could have been my Grandmothers. I had to try and choose between hanging the blanket over the blinds to block out the light or put it on top of the duvet to keep me confortable. In the end I chose the bed and spent the night trying to sleep in semi-darkness. Over and above this you can hear everything that goes on in the corridors, which incidentally are a horrible, dark, purple/brown colour and the room doors deep red. There is no room service and the 'restaurant' downstairs closes at 9pm.

The good points of this hotel are the proximity to the conference centre and Darling Harbour with the many bars, restaurants etc and pleasant views. A short walk to the Sydney CBD too. This is where the good ends. The staff were also quite friendly and attentive. The hotel seems to charge a WAY TO HIGH cost per night considering the style of hotel it is, if it was cheaper then i would rate the hotel higher. I know Sydney is an expensive city, but while I was in the hotel I found a couple of better places nearby with similar rates - including a huge serviced apartment! Too bad my room was prepaid. Here is the low down: The rooms are tiny, this is quite normal for Ibis but for this price you expect a bit more in width as you could barely get past the bed. The only space for your bag - and it better not be a suitcase as it would not fit is the built in pseudo \"seat\". The mattress is one of the most uncomfortable mattresses ever. it needs replacing. There are two pillows, one hard as a rock and the other flat as a pancake. There is no duvet- it is a sort of \"mattress protector like\" material stuffed inside the sheet - cheap and nasty, you are cold at night if the aircon is on, if you leave the aircon off you can't breath as its too stuffy. There is a dusty blanket on top of the \"cupboard\" - but who wants to use that. Needless to say my sleep quality was poor, I had trouble sleeping every night (see also \"noise\" below). The \"cupboard\" is really a space near the window about 25 -30 cm wide where you can hang your clothes - NO DRAWERS anywhere - they could easily fit under the built in desk by the window - i hate not having drawers, there is no where to put your stuff. The bathroom although small is adequate, it has lots of shelf space but there is a stand alone sink with no space around it when they could have put in a small bench. My toilet cistern was not working properly, I had to keep fixing it by opening the back. I think the worse thing of all is the paper-like quality of the walls - you can hear it very loud when someone above or to the side of you has a shower, watches TV or coughs. You can hear it really loudly when people walk down the hallway. Oh yes - the cleaners - they begin cleaning by 7.30 -8.00 am - they don't care that guests might be sleeping - they bang doors, the vacuum cleaner on the walls, they talk loud.... and they bang on your door if you don't have your do not disturb sign up, and since there is no chain on the door, you freak out they might come in so get up anyway. But you can't sleep anyway if the racket is going on outside. The internet charges are ridiculous! I \"thought\" I was signing up for 24 hours to use as I like over my stay for $24. But this was only 24 hours full stop. What a rip off! I had to hire a locker to store my luggage after checkout for $7. It was so cheap and nasty - yet it was not cheap as I paid! Never seen this before in a hotel. It leaves a nasty feeling inside. I never had breakfast here - why should i when there is no view... I took the short walk to Darling Harbour and dined by the seaside every morning.

Upon arrival the receptionist asked for my debit card so they could take the details as payment insurance. Went upstairs to find that instead of the twin room we had asked for they had given us a double bed. Upon informing the receptionist of this, she informed us that there was an electrical fault in the room we had booked and so they had moved us to the room next door, and that we would be moved the following day. She did not ask if my collegue and I minded sharing a bed, which I found highly inapproriate. As compensation she told us we would not be charged for the first mornings breakfast, and that we would be moved to a twin room the next morning. So they gave us $30 of scrambled eggs in place of a nights stay in a twin room that cost over $200. The next day we spent out of the hotel, and upon returning in the afternoon we found our room had not been changed. We went downsatirs and asked to be moved to the room we had booked. It appeared the woman who we had spoken to the previous night had made absolutely no note that we had requested a room change. The gentleman at the desk who served us and gave us new key cards actually rolled his eyes at my collegue when she asked when we should return the old room key cards before answering. On the morning we checked out, I went to check my bank balance and found that the money for the hotel was not visible in my account, so I presumed they had already charged me. Upon checking out however, I was informed that my money was simply frozed to insure that I was able to pay for the hotel but had not been withdrawn. I was then told that the money could not be unfrozen for three business days and that I had to find another way to pay. At no point during the booking of the hotel or upon checking in was I informed that they would freeze my money and require another payment, and when my card was taken upon check in I was told they were just taking the details of my card, not actually accessing any money. I paid using a family members credit card and was told that the hotel would contact their bank and my funds would be unfrozed by the following day. The following day the frozen money was not released to me. Instead they were taken from my account by Ibis, meaning they have now taken two payments for the one booking, leaving us over $500 short. It has been four business days since check out and I am still waiting for my funds to be returned.

We booked our 3 rooms through their online reservation at their website. When we first made the reservation, we were notified that there was an error in their system and our booking was not finalized. We tried again using a different card and the booking was finalized and confirmed. Upon receipt of the credit card billing, we were shocked to discover that we were charged TWICE even though we only received 1 confirmation. We contacted the hotel but was told that the package we took was non-refundable. Therefore, even if we did not receive any confirmation for the other booking due to the hotel's system error, we will not be refunded for the booking. In short, we are being forced to pay AUD$1,836 for a booking that was NOT confirmed. They offered to extend the credit until June 2011 but we only go to Sydney once a year for the exhibition so we tried if they can extend it until June 2012. Again, our request was denied. All these happened BEFORE we even left for Australia. During the trip, the reservations manager offered to look into the matter but after explaining the whole thing again, we were only told that it is non-refundable and cannot be extended until 2012. Makes you wonder why they even bother asking you if they will not do anything about it. We also tried to talk with the hotel management but we were being passed from the front desk to the reservations department with no one offering to address our situation. Even if the location of the hotel is good because it is close to the exhibition center, it is not worth paying AUD$3,672 for three rooms where there is no disposable slipper and 2 TV remote controls were not working. If we do not get any consideration for refund or extension of credit until June 2012, we will be filing a formal complaint to the Manila office of the Australian Trade Commission at the Australian Embassy and sending a complaint letter to the Australian Tourism Board.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cPyrmony Darling Harbour\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR112008526", "Content": "Very convenient location.

If McDonalds can offer free WiFi to all its customers, then surely it's time that all hotels do the same. $5 for 30 minutes is unacceptable, and before you pay it I would suggest visiting the Harbourside Shopping Mall which has internet stations at $2 per hour - far more acceptable!

We took the tram from Central Station but it was damn hard to find the tram terminal (no signage from the line we arrived on, and even the station staff didn't know how to get there!) and when we got off underneath the Ibis, there was no signage to get us to it! We had to pay full room rate as we used Accor vouchers to pay for the stay. At $249 per night (via their website) the rooms were very expensive in our eyes. The Brisbane Ibis, practically in the CBD also, has rooms twice the size with two queen beds, for half the price in our experience :-O I have never before faced the problem of paying for the location, but had to suck it up this time. We had just one suitcase between us, and even for four night, we found the room very small for two people. The bathroom was incredibly cramped, if attractive.

As I had a 7am arrival after an overnight flight, I called the hotel to ask if they could provide early check-in. The answer was no, so I agreed to make the reservation to start from the day before. They took my details but suggested that I book on their web site as that offered a cheaper rate. I booked the pre-pay rate for 5 nights on the Accor web site. So on arrival, I experienced the following: 1. I didn't have a reservation! After a 10 minute delay and the clerk disappearing into the manager's office, they found my reservation but said that check-in was from 14:00! 2. I showed my copy of the reservation confirming arrival the day before and explained about the phone call. After another 5 minute trip to the manager's office I was told, 'there are no rooms available at present but I could change in the lobby toilets'! 3. I said this was completely unacceptable as I had pre-paid for the room, with their knowledge, to guarantee early check-in. Another 5 minutes away with the manager and I was offered a room to change in, but I would have to change rooms later as there was 'a problem with the shower'. I accepted this under protest. 4. When I returned later in the day, I was told that I could stay in the room after all. On the first 2 nights the hotel was extremely noisy from midnight with people shouting in the corridors and banging doors. I (and other guests as we came out into the corridor to see what was going on) called the front desk to ask them to intervene, but nothing was done and the noise continued until 3 am. The restaurant in the evening was a further disaster, with just one girl serving and attempting to cover 20 tables! I arrived early and had a slow dinner with disappointing food. Most other people who followed me didn't stay but left when they were either not seated or seated but then abandoned. I complained in writing to Accor about these problems, to which the reply from the front desk manager \"I am sorry to read that your experience did not meet your expectations. It is disappointing to read your comments and it is clear that we have let you down in a number of areas across our operation. As a fairly new management team currently operating in this hotel we have a strong focus on guest service and we really do value your feedback. We hope to see some major changes with some of the wonderful new staff we have hired and the training courses we have put in place. I do hope that you will return and note these changes yourself in the near future.\" The IBIS offer a '15 minute satisfaction promise' which they claim that if they can't sort your problem with 15 minutes, your night's stay is free. Apparently this does not apply to problems with reservations... The hotel itself is tired and in need of refurbishment. The room carpets are stained, and the walls scuffed. My window was so dirty (on the outside) that when the sun was on it, it was impossible to see out. The bedding and bathrooms are clean, although there was a musty smell in my bathroom if I left the fan off. On several days only 1 of the 3 elevators was working, resulting in queues and delays. Even teabags are not replenished in the rooms - you have to ask for more at the front desk.

It was small and Spartan, with starkly modern styling. Our travel agent said that the hotel was completely refurbished in 2007. We would not have guessed that any major maintenance too place that recent. The room Our room was about 166 square feet, including the bath. Every square inch is put to good use. A bulit-in desk is situated in front of the window, and is sandwiched between a bench on one side, and a door-less closet on the other. Bed The Queen sized (60\" x 80\") bed was on rollers, and would scoot across the room if bumped. This may have been a good thing since in its normal location, there is only an 14\" passage on the side nearest the wall. The mattress was of medium firmness, but comfortable. Bedding includes a bottom sheet which pulled out when the very light comforter sandwiched between two sheets was untucked. There is no bed spread. An additional blanket was provided, as well as a total of three bed pillows, and two small decorative pillows. Bath We were supplied with 2 good sized (30\"x55\") light weight bath towels, two wash cloths and a bath mat. There were no hand towels since, as the houskeeper advised, this is a 3 star, not a 4 star hotel. (If we were awarding the stars, we might not be quite so generous.) There is a shower, with a very good shower head and sufficient water stream. There is no tub. For some unknown reason, a digital timer was affixed to the shower wall. Shampoo, conditioner, and two extremely small bars of soap were provided. The sink is free-standing, without a counter. Toiletries can be placed on a nearby shelf unit. Power Australian power is 220 V with angled socket slots like so: \\ / The bath power outlet has one 110 V. socket for US style plugs, but it did not accept polarized or 3 pronged plugs. We could find only one other power source in the room--a 220 V Australian style socket on the desk. All outlets are switched, so one has to be sure that the outlet is turned on when charging batteries. Fortunately, we had packed a multiple plug adapter in addition to Australian to US plug adapters. Since all of our electronic devices can operate on 110 to 240 V, we did not need a power converter. Room lights may be turned off from a switch above the built-in nightstand--a nice touch, even though we felt as if we could probably touch any part of the room from bed. A/C The single solid pane window did not open even a crack. Fortunately the air conditioning system worked well. The analog thermostat provided excellent temperature control for both heating and cooling. The fan had three settings and was reasonably quiet on the lowest speed setting. Amenities There are no ice machines on any floor, but ice is available from the bar. The room had a tiny refrigerator, an iron, ironing board, and a coffee maker with coffee, tea, and ceramic cups. A combination phone and clock radio did not function to call our friends in a nearby room. It was able to connect to the front desk, and two days and two repair requests later, it became fully functional. A 20\" flat panel (not HD) television was affixed to the wall opposite the bed. As small as the room was, it still managed to make the television appear miniscule. Location The hotel's strongest feature is its location adjacent to Darling Harbor. If one exits the hotel from the harbor side and turns right, the Harbourside Shopping Center is a very short walk down a ramp and through the parking garage. The center contains food court with a good assortment of fast food restaurants (including McDonald's). Many full service restaruants line Darling Harbor. If one turns to the left when exiting the rear of the hotel, a monorail stop is a short walk away, and a stop for the hop-on hop-off bus is just a bit farther. Luggage storage before check-in If you arrive before your room is ready, you may leave your luggage in an unlocked, unsecure luggage room. You may chose to put your luggage in a locker for $7 for 24 hours. The locker will hold 2 carry-on bags, plus a couple of smaller bags.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "suzytony", "ReviewID": "UR59252126", "Content": "All you can say about this hotel is that it is clean and well situated for the sights and sounds of Darling Harbour.

We wanted to leave after 5 mins in the room but we had prepaid our accommodation. We booked directly via hotel website for 'stay 4 pay 3 nights' deal in a superior queen bed harbour view room. I'd read the TA reviews beforehand but still booked here thinking it couldn't really be that bad for an Ibis Hotel (being part of the Accor Group). Here's the good stuff. The hotel reception area looked pleasant, clean, well maintained and vibrant. Lots of tourist information/brochures available. Three computers are available for internet access (there are charges). Lounge area with TV to the right of reception. Locker room (charges apply). In our experience the staff were pleasant.

There is a taxi rank right outside the hotel and easy access to Darling Harbour, shopping centre, light rail and monorail, ferry to Balmain/Luna Park/Circular Quay and easy walking distance to Star City. Hotel is in a great location which makes it a shame to say that the room we had (814) was absolutely shocking. Ok so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ugly stuff!! Upon check-in we had to pay a fee of $50. This was not mentioned at the time of booking. Apparently it's for any charges that you may accrue during your stay (not charged to the credit card but held). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never encountered this before at a hotel so was a bit apprehensive about it. Both electronic key cards didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work even after several attempts. Back to reception and all sorted. Opened the door to the room to be smacked in the face with the most awful stank. Tried to open the window for fresh air but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open. At this time I did notice the view over Darling Harbour but I was trying hard not to throw up in my hands from the smell. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even describe the smell because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never smelted anything like it. Even my husband had a hard time dealing with the smell. The room is very small and would not be suitable for long stays not that you would want to even stay here anyway. We found it hard for 4 days with 2 small suitcases having to shuffle around. There is a small hanging closet. Has a mini-fridge that contains milk for the tea/coffee, and of course the kettle. Walls are thin and you can hear the doors slamming shut which was a bit annoying particularly late at night or in the early hours of the morning. LCD TV on the wall is small and not in a good position - glare from the sun and room lights. The afternoon sun blared into the room and blinds weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t block out (for two days of our stay the temperature was 35c). The carpet was damp and sticky and felt awful. So much so that we wore shoes the whole time in the room. Pulled back the bed covers and the sheet was dirty. Had some sort of sticky stain that looked like the residue of chewing gum. Bed covers consist of a sheet, doona (with no cover) and another sheet on top. Apart from that the bed was comfortable. We woke up in the early hours of the morning to find that the toilet had leaked in the very small bathroom. Hubby used the towels to mop it up.

Housekeeping barged into the room just before one of us had time to open the door (remembering it is a small room). We exchanged the sopping towels for new ones so we could have a shower and go out for the day. We had assumed that someone would return later to clean the room and hoped the sheets would be changed and the toilet leak fixed. Come back late in the afternoon and no sign that anyone had been in the room to clean it or to check the toilet leak. Fortunately we didn't have any more issues with the toilet leaking.

It was in many ways a mixed experience (both in terms of service and quality of the room). To summarize for those of you who do not want the details; good location, clean, reasonably comfortable, decent value but do not expect anything special (neither from the room nor from the staff). Looking at the location it is however a rather central location at Darling Harbour. It is easily walkable across the bridge to the CBD. There is also easy access to the monorail and the tram (personally I prefer walking but from what I understood it was 2-3 stops from the central station). It is however not the best location since it is sort of on the edge of the central parts of the city so while Chinatown and the CBD are close it is a bit further to Circular Quay, Paddington and Kings Cross but it is still a good location. We had the standard room, with the so called City view. Not an exciting view facing the street but we did not select the hotel based on the view. We had a queen size bad that was reasonable comfortable. The room was equipped with LCD-TV (not great quality but still ok) with a sufficient number of channels. The standard things were available (iron, water kettle, hair dryer). The bathroom was also ok, no tub but a shower. The overall impression was that everything that should be there was there and it was clean. It could have been less noisy (no noise from the street but from people out in the corridors) Most of the furniture etc felt a bit cheap (as usual at Ibis hotels) but worked as expected. The service experience was sort of mixed. We arrived early in the morning (7 am) so we did not expect the room to be ready (specifically considering it was such a busy time of the year) but we could check in at once. There were however some other parts of the service that was not as good. They managed to miss handing messages to us (a change in pick-up time for a tour - we received the message two days later when we checked out) and there was also a general lack of knowledge of rather basic information about Sydney. The personnel at the front desk were never rude although not very friendly either. Cleaning staff were slightly disorganized and showed up at odd times (one day they opened the door at our room around 7.30 am. We should of course have put the 'do not disturb'-sign up but still did not expect cleaning that early.

The shower room is minute but actually quite serviceable with lots of hot water but of course the soaps and shampoos are not of the highest quality. There are not enough power points so one is constantly unplugging and plugging to charge phones and use the computer. This is all well and good and would be tolerable if it were not for the noise! One wonders if the IBIS rents rooms by the hour as the noise in the corridors and constant slamming of doors all night long means sleep is impossible.

On arrival at the hotel at around mid morning we found that we had to join a very long que at reception to check in as ther was only one member of staff on the desk! After a lenghty wait (30mins) we were greeted by the less than friendly receptionist with a\"Yes\" . We stated that we wished to check in and gave her our names, to which she replied that could not find booking, we presented our confirmation details and they were taken and she left the reception area and went into a room at the back and then came out to say that it was ok!! She presented us with our room key and then proceed to ask the next person in line what did they want. We had to ask what floor room was on and were lifts where. They did have 3 lifts but it appeared that after a 10 minute wait that only 2 worked. The main corridors of the hotel are dull and grimey and the carpet stained, so we did not hold much hope on the room. The room, well what can I say, it was a shoe box, that overlooked the main road, 2 people could not pass by one another and so my husband had to sit on the bed if I wanted to pass to go to the bathroom or vice versa. The wardrobe had only enough room for you to hang 2-3 items of clothing and had no door! and the ironing board and iron had to be storted in it also so then it left no room for your clothesand as there was no drawers we had to keep our clothes in our suitcases, that we had to stack ontop of on one another on a chair as there was no room for them anywhere else!!! The general cleaniness of the room was ok. Again the bathroom was clean but very very small, you could stand and touch the walls with both arms outstreteched, and after a long fligh I was looking forward to a bath and there was none, just a shower cubicle which was very small as my husband learned when trying to shower as he is 6ft 4 and the showerhead was too low and he could just about turn in it. It did have tea and coffee making facilities and a small fridge, the air con was very noisey and when we tried to turn if off it was broken. We went to reception to report the fault and they advised us they will have it checked out. We deceided to escape the confines of the room and whilst at reception again joined the que to ask the receptionist about safety deposit box, things to do,restaurant times etc and we were pointed to a large display in a corner of the main entrance that held leaflets for things to do, the restaurant /bar did not open until 6pm and had a very limited menu and again service very slow and had only one staff member that did the orders, bar and served the food!! The cost was very expensive for a meal for 2 people and 2 drinks considering it was only burger and chips and fish and chips ($90). On a good note the safety deposit box was free and was in a room behind the reception area but you had to carry a large key around with you and ask at reception to access it as they also had a key and you had to fill out a form each time. Our air con problem was not sorted out, they sent the person cleaning the rooms to look at it and he told us that we needed to report it again to reception as he said that it was broke and sounded like a toilet cistern filling up!!! So I went back to reception and reported it again, now 10.30pm and was told by the receptionist that he would be up in 10 mins to have a look, after a 20 min wait they phone rang and it was reception asking if the air con was ok, i advised no and was told that would be up in 10 mins, after a further 15 mins wait they rang up again and asked the same question, then after a further 10 mins the receptionist came up to the room and stood on end of the bed and took the grill of the air con and started to poke at it with his pen, he then asked if anyone had flushed the toilet as he said it sounded like a cistern filling up! I advised no to which he replied that air con broken and that a main water pipe serving the hotel must run through this room and so he would move us in the morning to another room, no apologies given and told us to enjoy the rest of our night which at this stage was now into the early morning!!! The following morning we asked at reception and were moved to another room, with air con that worked, but beside the fire escape that had work men using it as maintenance was being carried out on the stair well, it was just as well that in Sydney there was lots for us to do during the day. The hotel is ideal location wise to the city centre which is a ten minute walk from the hotel over the darling harbour bridge, you can also access the city/darling harbour/mono rail and the aquarium/wildlife world etc via the back of the hotel. There is a very good shopping centre /bowling alley and lots of restaurants/bars around the darling habour area that cater for all tastes and pockets and can be accessed from the back entrance of the hotel and across the footbridge. The pyrmount hotel which is down the road from the Ibis hotel offers excellent food and drink at a very reasonable cost and the staff are very friendly and helpful and it is opened 24 hrs. A Thursday night was excellent as you can join in the crab racing for $4 a crab and the have such a good laugh and make new friends!!!!! The ibis had a vending machine in the hotel entrance if you got the muchies but the price was almost double that of the supermarkets nearby, the supermarket across from the hotel is very expensive and the staff are not friendly, I would use the Seven11 at the corner of the street as it is open 24 hrs and the staff are very friendly and it is much cheaper. When checking out we asked if the hotel would store our luggage and we were advised that they could not and that we could put our luggage in a locker for $7 in a room at the side of the hotel reception, the lockers will just about hold 1 small suitcase and only takes coins and the machine to get coins was broken and reception staff were not very nice when you asked for change.

As they failed to do so \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I am putting my honest review here. So \u00e2\u20ac\u201c first complaint: The rooms no longer have a feedback for in them. Instead there is a card that you put your email address on and they promise to email you a feedback form. They never did. I requested one from their website 2 weeks ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c still no feedback form. My booking was for 6 nights in February. Initially I attempted to book via the Accor website (which I have done many times before without issue) in early January. The system kept crashing after I entered credit card number. Eventually I rang their call centre and made the booking over the phone. I was told I would be upgraded to a top floor room on the harbour side \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on one of the newly renovated floors. I was told over the phone my credit card had been approved and debited. Upon check in I confirmed that I was definitely being put in a newly renovated room. It was confirmed that was the case. My room was 519 on 5th floor. It was May 2005 when I last stayed at the Ibis and I honestly couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any difference in the look or furnishings. The room was miniscule. Nowhere to put your suitcase once it was unpacked. The doorless wardrobe was 10 to 12 inches wide and that included the space the ironing board was taking up. I hung 3 tops and 2 jeans in there and it was already overcrowded. Bathroom: tiny. Shower stall only. Rust all around the bottom joins. Two very small towels provided \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no bigger than hand towels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thin and sandpaper-like, far from plush. When I first washed my hands the sink retained the water. I looked everywhere for a lever or knob that controlled the sink plug (which was a smooth silver circle). Eventually I rang reception and asked for assistance. They said they would send somebody up immediately. 30 minutes later I rang again. They stated they could get it fixed the next day. I advised I wanted to use the sink that night. Eventually someone came up at 11.35pm. He plunged his hands into the dirty soapy water and twisted and twisted the silver circle until it came undone. He advised it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new style plug\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. TV: No complimentary TV stations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just the free to air ABC, SBS, 7, 9 & 10. No volume control available so you could barely hear it. TV was a flat screen wall mounted LCD approx 14 inches wide (my laptop is bigger!). It was viewable only when sitting in one position on the bed. It could not be seen from anywhere else in the room. No security lock or chain on the door so if you succeeded in sleeping through housekeeping knocking on your door (or if you were in the shower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the bathroom door open due to lack of ventilation), housekeeping were able to stroll right on in. The door frame was crooked (or else the door had way too many coats of paint) and needed a good elbowing to open it. Judging by the sounds up and down the hallway - everyone had the same problem. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd door signs do not actually say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Just to be different they say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shhhhh I am sleeping\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This advice however did not stop housekeeping from banging down your door every 30 minutes from 8.30am onwards. Even when I got a texta and wrote \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I really truly am sleeping PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they still knocked. Bedding: Pillows were the $2 variety from a market stall. Soft and so floppy it took four of them to get my head 2 inches from the mattress. I noticed a tiny smudge of what appeared to be old hair dye on one of the spare pillows upon checkin. At the end of the week that same pillow case was still there. I gathered my sheets and pillow cases had not been laundered at all in 7 days. Curtains: I had a view of Darling Harbour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which also meant I faced the rising sun. The curtains were simply 2 woven mat screens to pull across. My photos show that the city lights (and the rising sun) blazed through them. I mentioned this on several occasions to the front desk. I first asked if I could swap to a Pyrmont view room but the hotel was fully booked. I next asked if could get a blanket to peg up across the window. I was told there were no spare blankets. (Linen supply was clearly an issue as three days in a row I had to ring and ask for face clothes and towels as mine had been removed but not replaced!). Finally on day 5 I yet again mentioned to reception (when they asked how my stay was going) that I had not slept all week due to the lights and sun. The guy said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oh haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you found the secret hidden rubber curtain yet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all the rooms on that side have one. You should have been shown how to find it when you checked in.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oh ??????? Why on earth would you have a curtain that is secret and hidden ??? So he advised he would send housekeeping up to help me out with the curtain. About 4 hours later housekeeping knocked on the door. A shy smiling man stood there and handed me a small box. I wondered if it was a special key or remote to would reveal the secret location of the curtain. I asked him if he was here to help me with the curtain. He nodded and pointed to the box and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153curtain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I opened the box and found 3 cotton buds (Q tips to some). I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I need help with the curtain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, pointing to the window. He nodded and smiled and pointed to the box again and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153curtain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I smiled, said thanks and closed the door. Something tells me there is somewhat a gaping hole in the language barrier between the indian reception desk clerk and the Mauritian housekeeping that would never get beyond the difference between CURTAIN and COTTON ! After much searching and climbing on not so secure looking desk tops, I finally located a chain hiding behind a lip in the window frame, tugging it revealed a rubber curtain that did indeed block out the sun. My suggestion to the Ibis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c put a freaking sign on the desk that tells people about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret hidden curtain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Also on day 5 of my stay I received a message under my door that stated my credit card booking had not been processed in January when I made my phone booking as their computers had been down. At no time in the next 5 weeks did they attempt to contact me by phone, email or mail (all provided with the booking), and at no time did they bother to re-input my transaction. Very unimpressed. Breakfast: is not included in your room price. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an exorbitant $17 extra. To say it was a standard buffet breakfast would be insulting to all the standard breakfast buffets out there in the world. The hot food was stodgy and cold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if there was any. Most of the baine maries were empty. People were knocking on the kitchen doors asking for refills. Finding staff was basically impossible. The coffee/tea machine had so many knobs and buttons and controls you needed a pilots license to operate it. People stood and stared at it before again knocking on the kitchen door and demanding assistance. Honestly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my suggestion is head out the back doors and walk along to the monorail station where you will find an elevator down to Harbourside shopping mall. Head to the food hall. Plenty of breakfast choices including Gloria Jeans. All more filling and cheaper than the Ibis. Broadband (not wireless): As with so many Australian hotels (who lag behind the entire world in this regard) the cost is ridiculous. 50cents per minute or $27.50 per day. When you consider the average person pays that per month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I cannot fathom how hotels are permitted to charge this per day. Its overpriced for its quality (or lack there of). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 2 star pretending to be a 3 star but charging the same as the infinitely better quality 5 star Star City around the corner. You are paying for its location and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all. Its convenient to Pyrmont, Star City, Darling Harbour, the monorail, and Harbourside shops. Would I stay here again ?

The room we stayed in was on the tenth floor, but our view wasn't the best as we faced onto the street to the front of the hotel. The rear faces onto Darling Harbour and I'd imagine the view from those rooms would be tremendous. The room itself was small with two single beds. An absolutely tiny wardrobe area which could only hold about four hangers. Needless to say our suitcase remained packed for the 5 days we were there! The bathroom was also small. Breakfast was available, but we didn't use these facilities as Darling Harbour is only a two minute walk away and provide plenty of options for eating. The location of this hotel made up for it's basic facilities. Darling Harbour is a fantastic area. It's full of bars and restaurants and has a ferry terminal which takes you to the bridge and opera house. At night it's beautiful with the lights of the skyscrapers and around the bay turned on. The hotel is easy to get to too. From either the domestic or international airports a train connects to Sydney Central. A tram then connects you to the Convention Centre which is directly at the rear of the hotel. Transfer from airport to check in took about 50 minutes.

I was in for a bigger shock when I opened by room door and the smell of damp carpet and cigarette smoke (for a room with a large no smoking sign on the door, this was not a good start). I then discovered that the toilet had paper in it and that there was a large damp patch on the carpet. I rang reception and explained that it was unacceptable and wished to be moved to another room and was told (with no apology) that the hotel was full, so my choices were limited. I unpacked, then called a friend and decided to move to his hotel. I grabbed the phone book to call the other hotel and then discovered it was mouldy from damp! At reception I advised them I was leaving and I was told I still had to pay for the room for the night! To add insult to injury, I asked for a cab to be called and was told that they pass the hotel all the time!

The smell was so overwhelming that we requested a new room, even if it meant waiting all over again! The other party that was waiting for a room when we checked in was still there, and finally left for another hotel because they were so fed up with waiting.
