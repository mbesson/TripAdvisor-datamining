The weather was fantastic and Key West is full of fun things to do. It took a while to sort out where we wanted to stay as none of us had been to Key West before. After weeks of searching on line it became apparent that there are no cheap places to stay in Key West and our focus came down to location. We wanted to be close to the action on Duval Street but not close enough to be disturbed by it. We also wanted to be centrally located to the beach areas and restuarants. Our other criteria was that we wanted to experience some Key West charm with the older style buildings and neighborhoods. After a long search we came up with the Lighthouse Court. The building is full of Key West charm and sits directly across the street from the Hemingway home, which by the way, is well worth the price of admission, An historic lighthouse is visible from the property. Lighthouse Court is one block from Duval St. but sits in a quiet, scenic neighborhood. Many great restuarants and bars are in easy walking distance. If you walk a short distance north from the Lighthouse Court you can see Mallory Square and the cruise ship docks. If you walk a shorter distance south you will come to the Southernmost Point in the US and a great little cafe on the beach that serves a great, inexpensive breakfast. Our room at Lighthouse Court, a suite, was very roomy and clean. We had a King Bed, a large bathroom, and a separate sitting room. A small deck out front overlooked a nice pool area that featured a small pool bar and an area that served a continental breakfast every morning. The only complaint about the breakfast was that there was no fruit, only cereal, bagels, toast, etc. The only negative about our stay, and it's not a huge one, is that there was a rooster roaming the property. This seems to be a regular occurance at many Key West properties. This particular rooster was very noisy and set up camp directly under our bedroom window. He could be heard at all hours of the very early morning and I would suspect that is why there was a basket of earplugs in our room. Having said that, our stay at the Lighthouse Court was very enjoyable. The property was beautiful, well kept, and the location couldn't have been more perfect for what we wanted to do in Key West. I would recommend it to anyone looking for old Key West charm instead of a large chain hotel.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "clearwater", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel right off Duval\u201d", "Author": "vpsales", "ReviewID": "UR125460673", "Content": "Cute little hotel that is a group of old buildings that have been remodeled along with the surrounding property.

Needless to say we booked four nights and stayed one, had we been able to leave right away we would have. But it was President's Day Weekend and Key West was packed and the very unfriendly staff knew it. The first room we were given had torn furniture cushions, moldy dirty bathroom tiles, smelled god awful and there was debris (hair, crumbs, paint chips etc.) running along the floor boards. When we approached the front desk and explained our dissatisfaction over the room and more importantly its cleanliness, they seemed shocked and stated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are one of the historic inns of Key West and these are the things that make us historic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It was almost as if they were used to dropping this line on people. It became the standard line across the board for the 16 or so hours we stayed there. After a debating with the extremely unfriendly front desk clerk she agreed to go and look at the room with us. Upon entering she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to see any problems again telling us it was the whole \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thing and because of the humidity in Key West you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always keep things from getting moldy. Upon returning to the front desk we told her we would like another room and we were not sure we wanted to stay at all. She began whispering with the other clerk and got up and went behind a closed door to make a phone call presumably to the manager. She was able to find another room, but told my wife that we needed to make a decision if we were going to stay or not. Otherwise if someone else came to check in, she was going to give the room away. Since we had nothing else lined up we said we would take it and then began the mad dash to find an alternate location. The second room was a little better than the first, but not by much. There were wrappers on top of the shower wall that appeared to have been there for a while. Stickers, debris and even used toilet paper between the toilet and the walls. The room was in major need of cosmetic work as well, cracked walls, chipping paint and dirty carpet. We turned the ceiling fan off because it was a bit breezy over the bed and the caked on dirt and dust was unexplainable. In the morning when we were checking out, I asked the same very unfriendly clerk if the manager was working. She was and I explained my dissatisfaction with her regarding all of the above issues. I explained that for the $325 I paid for one night was downright criminal. I stressed to her that I wanted to walk through the room with her to see if she felt it was worth $325. Once inside the room she saw what I was talking about and again the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd line came out. I told her I was grateful she had refunded the money for the other three nights, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel it was right to pay full price for the state that room was in. She ended up giving me a credit of $100, but I felt I still got ripped off. I would say The Lighthouse Court is similar if not lesser quality than a Motel 6 or Red Roof Inn. We were able to find a beautiful little cottage at Simonton Court and it was actually less money than what the Lighthouse Court was charging. I thought I had this terrible experience in the rearview mirror until my wife realized she left her phone charger in the room. I called the desk two days after we had left and they told me they had it. Luckily when I arrived the really unfriendly lady wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working, however I was greeted by an equally unfriendly clerk. They had the charger in a bag, with our reservation slip stapled to it. How hard would it have been to call and tell us we forgot it? They knew we were staying in Key West for another three nights after we left. There is just a complete and total lack of any customer service and common sense at this place. This is my first time posting on Trip Advisor, mostly because I like to use it to find out about places before traveling. The Lighthouse Court was just so bad that I felt I needed to let fellow travelers know what this place is like.

The hotel itself is pretty unique with several different types of rooms. We got a package deal on expedia with flight down to Key West and went with the Lighthouse Court since it looked to be within decent walking distance to most of the stuff we planned to see.If you plan to hang out in the Mallory Square area a lot, I'd reccomend getting a closer hotel unless you plan on driving or bringing/renting a bicycle. It's not a hard walk to do but in the summer you'll probably show up soaking in sweat if you go in the mid-afternoon. The Room: The room itself could have been better. The toilet had \"issues\" the first morning...the staff showed up and handed us a small plunger. We explained that it wasn't clogged so they sent someone up to fix it. We also noticed a trail of ants that went from the bedroom area to the kitchen so we didn't keep any food in there. Looking back, those issues make the room sound horrible but it was actually pretty good otherwise however if I read about those kind of things I'd probably be deterred The rest of the hotel: The location was pretty good We were right across the street from the Hemmingway house and next door to the lighthouse. It was handy being relatively close to those places when we went to them but most of the time we would go down to the Mallory square area and that is a little bit of a walk. Some of the side streets are dark and questionable on the way back late at night. The continental breakfast was pretty consistent, it had your basic juice, yogurt and bagels/muffins. No meat. We kind of liked the chickens bumming from us every day (the same chicken too), they were really friendly. (Key West seems to have tons of Chickens all over the place). We didn't really bother with the bar they had in the hotel, really small and in Key West there is no shortage of places to have a drink and short walk away. Overall it's a good place to stay if you can get a really cheap price for the hotel.

We had a washer and dryer in our suite, but I don't think all rooms have that available. 3) Hemingway Suite - This is a really nice suite, but isn't worth $299/night after you read the \"bads\" below. There is a private wrap-around porch and beautiful open ceilings with excellent woodwork on the inside. There is a full kitchen, nice shower heat controller, washer and dryer, and upstairs loft with the bedroom. The overall appearance is excellent, but again not worth the money when all things are considered. Bads: 1) Parking - There is VERY limited parking onsite. I think that for 300 bucks a night they should have a designated spot for the Hemingway Suite to park a vehicle (\"best room in the house\"). We were lucky enough to find a spot to park both times we moved the car. However, while we were waiting (and waiting, and waiting) for a spot to open up, I went in and asked the lady at the front desk where we should park. She told me to go two blocks up and pay $15 per day in the public lot. I think that is assinine when we were paying $300/night for a room. More importantly, she was NOT nice about it. When you do park, you leave your keys at the front desk (hours 7am-10pm), you leave your keys with the front desk so that they can move your car if someone else needs to get out because they are parked behind each other. 2) Noise - You cannot hear the sounds of Duval Street from this location. However, the walls are paper thin. The Key West roosters started up at 3:15 each morning and it sounded like they were next to the bed. Thankfully we brought EAR PLUGS - they are a MUST if you stay here! Even with ear plugs in, we were woken by the sounds of our neighbors having a good time, if you know what I mean. The awning outside was not secured well and squeaked very loudly every time the wind blew. 3) Staff - I expect excellent staff and service when paying this kind of money. I received neither. The red-haired lady at the front desk was extremely unfriendly and made me cringe ever time we had to drop off our keys. etc. The breakfast was not put out of time on Friday which caused us to not be able to eat until 1pm that day because we were headed on an excursion and couldn't wait around. The lady that was supposed to be putting it out was certainly not in a hurry either. 4) Price - There are a lot of very nice places to stay in Key West without having to spend this kind of money. I won't make that mistake again. 5) Maintenance - The drain was clogged in our shower the first two nights and the remote for the fans was broken so we could not turn them off. The refrigerator rocked (a lot) when opening and closing the door, etc.... Overall, we had an excellent trip to Key West, but this room was not a part of our positive experience.

The aesthetic and character of the hotel was really nice, and there were some nice extra touches like a hammock and that hacky sack toss game. We all mostly hung out around the pool for five days and enjoyed our stay. They were accommodating by putting the families with young children in the rooms that were not immediately around the pool. p.s. We all thought the earplugs were for the roosters on-site! The entire place looks a little worn--and they are obviously in the middle of improvements as the entire week (not weekends) they were renovating a building as a new room and scraping, filling and painting the exterior. It was a bit noisy for us who spent most of our time around the pool. The rooms should be next at getting a facelift (the top of our sink was coming detached from the pedestal base, one or two bathroom tiles were loose, carpets are old), but otherwise rooms are fine, nothing high end. I will first say we thought the housekeeping staff was very sweet and engaging with our young son. However, our larger party had a number of disconcerting issues in their rooms. In short: two instances of inappropriate hair in the bed upon check-in (I will always turn the sheets back to check after this experience!); a moldy smell in one room; and a mouse in another. The first two issues were remedied by giving a new room, but still disconcerting. Our carpet could have used a real good steam cleaning (in addition to the fact that it didn't look vacuumed when we arrived). I had to spot clean some yogurt off the carpet during our stay and the towels I used were black after. The only excuse I can think of is that since so many of us were checking in around the same time, they struggled to get all the rooms ready; I would hope this wouldn't be the case all the time. Finally, the front desk staff was hit or miss, but mostly just luke warm. While they were accommodating and responsive, I would expect a bit more friendliness for a hotel like this.

Housekeeping provided earplugs that we didn't use. I don't require a whole lot from a hotel room other than being clean and comfortable because I don't spend much time in it. This place fit that bill. The complementary continental breakfast was good. I really didn't use the pool, but there always seemed to be someone in it or laying around the pool area. The staff was always courteous. Location is excellent, directly across from the Hemingway house and a block off Duval st. We took our bicycles, which I highly recommend. It makes getting around much easier. There were several racks at the front of the property. The only real drawback is the lack of parking.

They have their own cafe and bar right next to the pool with decent prices (drinks are a little high, but hey ... you don't have to go anywhere AND KW is already expensive).

Located on Whitehead Street & Truman Avenue, one block behind Duval Street and directly across from the Hemingway House, everything is within walking distance. We arrived on Friday night, and it was pretty quiet around there. We were upgraded from a standard room to a king room with a private porch. Our room was on the far south end, right next to the actual lighthouse, and facing Whitehead Street. We could sit on the porch and watch the people walking up and down Whitehead, touring the Hemingway House, etc. Our room was nice, but basic. There was no closet, or armoire so we could not hang anything on hangers...not a big issue, because you're in Key West, and it is CASUAL!!! The bathroom was well lit, and did have a good hair dryer. My hair is quite long, and even though it is small, it was plenty powerful enough. I wished there was a small shelf or 2 to place some necessities on, but again, not a big deal...keeping things in my bag when I was done with them, keeps me from forgetting things and leaving them behind. The biggest surprise to me was how much activity there was out front on Whitehead Street during the day. This was not a super busy time of year, but even so, quite early each morning, I would wake up to the sounds of people chatting and bustling by outside. If you hate mornings, and love to sleep in, ask for a room with more privacy than these on the front of the property, with a private porch. All-in-all we throughly enjoyed our stay, had no issues, and found the Lighthouse Court an excellent choice especially for the going rates of single rooms in Old Town. Oh, I almost forgot...the bed was very firm, but not uncomfortable. But if you prefer to \"sink\" into your bed, may want to ask if they have pillowtop mattresses available and choose one of those rooms.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gorham, Maine", "Title": "\u201cAir conditioner/heater\u201d", "Author": "merryreader", "ReviewID": "UR92760068", "Content": "When we arrived it was the coldest since the 1800's and we bundled up with the extra blankets the office supplied at our request.

Got here on a record-setting cold day. And it warmed up only marginally until the day we left. I picked the Lighthouse hotel because of its location and largely positive reviews. Now afterwards, I'm a little suspicious of some of the more glowing reviews, particularly any review that doesn't mention the hassle parking your car. Upon arriving rather late in the afternoon, the check-in clerk went over the pool hours, the continental breakfast and everything but didn't mention parking. I was currently at a meter about six blocks down, the closest I could get. When I asked about parking, the clerk asked rather incredulously, \"You brought your car?\" What, like guests usually parachute in for their stays? She said the limited parking at the hotel was full so I was on my own. I did see some vacant \"residential\" spaces nearby. Could I park there? \"I wouldn't recommend it,\" was the response. So, what was I supposed to do? The clerk suggested I park at a pay lot for the night, then move to parallel park on the street closer to the hotel in the morning when there'd likely be more spots. The pay lot cost $20 and the attendant seemed surprised I wanted to leave the car, a new 2010 only a month-old, there for the night. But he let me and the next morning I was able to get a spot on Whitehead Street on the block next to our hotel. One reason people just leave their car parked for their stay and get around on foot or whatever is that they don't want to go through the hassle of finding a free spot again. I saw one lady standing in a vacant spot next to the hotel to reserve it while her husband retrieved their car. There are lots of transportation options once you do finally find parking--cabs, pedicab, rentals, walking--and nothing seems very far. But keep your car locked at all times. At night I saw shady locals checking out cars and one even trying the door to see if was locked. Tourist brochures describe this as close to an \"urban\" environment so take that for what it's worth. But nothing happened to our vehicle in the three days and nights we were there. Other than parking, the positives were the lovely landscaped grounds, the friendliness of the staff, the ideal location for exploring what Key West has to offer, and the cleanliness of the exterior spaces. On the downside, our TV didn't offer many of the channels advertised on the printed TV guide, the carpet seemed as if it hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in quite some time (which we discovered when cleaning up a spill), the combination heater/AC was difficult to reach and kicked out about as much heat as a 100-watt light bulb, the wi-fi only worked in certain rooms (not our's of course) and the thin walls are definitely not soundproof . Don't do or say anything you want your neighbors to hear. All in all, we did rate our stay positively, however. Key West has quite a diverse collection of activities to entertain, educate, and enjoy.

Yes, there are areas that could use a little repair here and there and yes there are things that could be better but you will not find a more accomodating hotel. From the time we checked in with Bonnie until the time we checked out 7 days later, we could not have asked for anything more.

Only negative thing I can say about this place is parking. I have never had a car while I was visiting in Key West, the past 20 years, but I would say that space is very limited onsite. They double park so you have to leave your keys with the front desk if you are blocking someone else in. Again, I could go on and on, but this place is what Key West is about.

It is superbly situated, directly opposite the Hemmingway House, and 2 blocks from Duval Street. That is really all that it has in it's favor. Check- in experience was very poor. Made to pay for entire stay at check-in! (Hey, nice to be trusted, eh?). Long walk to room, with bags - NO offer for any porter to help. Parking is NON-EXISTENT. Be very aware of this. You will have to unload bags, then go and find a street parking place as close as you can - and good luck with that! Rooms VERY small. Nothing wrong with them, if you are a dwarf. They were clean and tidy, but really you could not swing a cat. Very pricey for a room of this quality. Pool area very small, and far too close to the rooms. People are enjoying themselves by the pool, obviously. The noise of this means that you get little rest in your room if you like peace and quiet. Bar area at pool has limited selection. However, very nice barkeep who was really helpful, professional and polite. Sadly, he was totally overworked as this bar needs two people to run it at busy times, but hotel is too cheap to employ a 2nd barkeep. Prices at bar were reasonable. This hotel has nothing actually wrong with it, it just isn't anything special - but sadly their prices assume that they are. I hate not being trusted at a hotel I have booked (especially when cost of first night has already been debited) and the check in experience really stuck in my throat. If you are prepared to pay a BIG premium for location, then this is for you. Next time I will stay further out at a comfortable hotel, for less money, and use the money i save to take Taxi cabs into Duvall Street.

I was very excited to stay at this location, especially based on the seemingly positive reviews I had read on tripadvisor. I booked the hotel from the historic key west inn's website, primarily for it's location - which is across the street from the Hemingway house. We arrived on a Friday afternoon and planned to check out on Sunday, I was ready to leave that night. My husband and I went to dinner, and upon return we asked if we could just check out the next morning - we were rudely informed by the evening clerk at the desk that it is a 2 night minimum so was were basically screwed. He said we could talk to the manager in the AM, but that it probably wouldn't be of help. The negatives - a hotel should not promote free parking when there are not enough spaces available for the amount of rooms that they have. They have 10 maybe 12 spaces - I could just assume since no one spot ever became available during our visit. We were directed to a few \"pay\" lots several blocks away, but my husband and I were fortunate to find some free street parking about 3 blocks away. There is free street parking outside the hotel itself, but based on the dust & condition of the majority of the vehicles - they have been there for a long time. We stayed in room B2. The room was located on the deck level above the pool. The room was worn, musty, and was full of stains. The furniture was old and worn, there was no way to control the overhead ceiling fan which was on the whole time ( and humming). Both windows (bathroom & in main room) had broken locks on the windows which is a true safety concern. I am not sure how you are expected to have a goodnight sleep knowing that your windows do not lock. The free continental breakfast served was a true joke - it was carb central - apples, bagels, english muffins and fiber yogurt. The poor area had a cute little bar & snack shop. They also had a not so cute sign that NO OUTSIDE FOOD OR DRINK can be consumed at the pool area - um yeah - sorry dude, I am drinking my own water - thank you We never did make to to talk to the manager - so we sucked it up and stayed the additional night. For the amount I paid for 1 night, I could have stayed a hotel like La Concha on Duval (with garunteed parking) for an extra $20/night. I do want to acknowledge one of the clerks the morning we checked out. Her name was Denice I believe. She asked how we enjoyed our stay and I think she may have regretted she had. We explained our concerns to her and she sincerely felt bad and attempted to rectify the situation - at that point it was a little too late.

The king rooms were so small, we barely had room to walk around the bed, yet they were more expensive, didn't really make sense.

This place was OK. We had no major complaints about the accommodations overall, but it maybe was missing some of the little things that you'd hope to have in your room. For example, my mother (who was staying with me complained of not having room to put any of her toiletries in the bathroom. And, she wanted a hook or something on the back of the door to hang a towel or her clothes. The bathrooms are small, but they could add some shelving and some hooks, etc. to make them a little nicer. Also, our safe was attached to the floor in the corner of the room. This was really very inconvenient. My mom is 65 years old and was unable to actually see or get to the keypad to put anything in the safe. I'm 35 and while I could get in and out of the safe, it was a major hassle to do so. They need to move the safe onto a table (and bolt it into the wall) or into a shelf in the closet or something rather than on the floor. The best part about the hotel is the location. It's very close to Duvall St. My mom found it to be a challenging walk to Mallory Square. (however, I found it to be fine.) So, it depends on how much walking you want to do. The bed was comfortable. The air conditioning worked well but was loud. I actually thought that was probably a good thing because the roosters would have woken us up otherwise. However, if you get cold easily, this may be a problem for you. The courtyard is very pleasant here and the breakfast was a nice touch. (bagels, muffins, toast, coffee, juice and yogurt) Don't stay here, though, if you are choosing it for it's pool. The pool itself is tiny. You'd only want to use it to dip into for a moment if you get too hot. Also, the pool does not get much sun. It is very shady there. There is a sun deck above the pool which would get a little more sun, but there aren't many chairs up there. And, you have to watch out for splinters. (My brother managed to get a couple while walking around barefoot up there.) As others have said, a problem for this hotel is the parking. There are 10 (or less) spots, including ones where you block in other cars (and give your keys to the front desk). My star rating is not based on the following, but I do want to share an experience we had at this hotel: We actually felt so lucky to have found a spot in the hotel parking lot but later regretted parking there. (The other option was on-street parking (if you could actually find a spot, which seemed unlikely) or a $20 a day paid lot nearby.) The reason we regretted parking there was because when we got back from a long day of going to my brother's wedding and then to a sunset sail and then out to Duvall St., we returned to find a note from hotel management saying that a limb had fallen from a \"neighbor's\" tree and hit our car. They provided a name and the phone number for the Key West police dept for us to call if we wished to report it. (which we did) Our car had a noticable dent in the back of the roof just above the back windshield in addition to numerous scratches. My brother's car (which had been parked in front of ours) also sustained damage. I realize that some people will debate this with me, but if I park in the TINY lot that is the official parking lot for the hotel, I would think that they would take some responsibility for this. They did not and specifically refused when I asked about it. They said that they would have if it had been their tree, but that there was nothing they could do since the tree belonged to the neighbor. I beg to differ. There was SOMETHING that they could have done even if they refused to pay for at least part of the damage, such as providing one of the 6 nights that my brother and I paid for there for free or at a discounted rate - - - something that could have sought to make up for the hassle and expense that this damage was bound to cause. This was a LARGE limb - - at least 10 inches in diameter that obviously was hanging over the Lighthouse Court hotel parking lot. I was very disappointed that the management did nothing to try to compensate us for the damage to our vehicle. (The neighbor who owned the tree also refused to do anything. So, if I would like any compensation, I would have to take them to court (in Key West obviously), which I'm sure both the hotel and the neighbor realize is unlikely since I live out of state.) Like I said, there are people who will agree with the hotel management --- that because they were not \"legally\" responsible that there was nothing that they should have done. I expect greater service from the hotels that I choose to stay in. That is obviously my own personal view. 4 out of the 6 people in our group at breakfast the next morning agreed with my view, but I realize that it is not a clear cut issue. Just thought that I should post it since there will be those out there who will agree that they will want to stay in a place where they can feel secure that management will protect their interests and go out of their way to ensure a pleasant, stress-free stay. Otherwise, this hotel is an adequate place to stay. However, if I were to go back, I'd probably stay where my cousins did at Southernmost on the Beach where they said there was plenty of parking, a nice pool with poolside service and where they are right on the beach.

We returned to find that we had been upgraded to a slightly larger room, however one of the biggest issues was that the room was incredibly dark even in the middle of the day, we couldn't always have curtains open due to privacy as we were on the ground floor and behind reception meaning that most guests had to walk past our window. The room was large however and bed very comfortable, albeit we were forever bashed our legs on the wooden bed frame (as did the maintenance guy who came to fix our safe!) Housekeeping wasn't as good as it could have been with something being missed most days, such as bins not being emptied or hand towels not being replaced. The bathroom could have also done with some updating and some extra shelving for toiletries. The outside space of the hotel was pleasant with lots of porches and trees with a great deck on the upper floor for sunbathing and a cute little pool. They do state that you aren't supposed to take your own drinks to the pool but every time I went to the bar there was no-one serving so we did end up taking our own.

Also, the 14\" opening into the shower required going in sideways, very carefully, to avoid damaging vulnerable body parts. A big person is definitely not going to fit. A shower update is WAY overdue, and meanwhile there should be a serious price break for guests who end up in 5C.

We went upstairs and checked things out, and we were pleasantly surprised. We were in the king size room, C3, and yes it was smaller than the average hotel room we typically stay in, but it is a historic inn. The area surrounding the hotel does leave much to be desired, but as we came to find, that is the \"charm\" associated with Key West. Some areas are brand new or newly rennovated while other areas are not. This difference didn't seem to be centered in one area or the other, that is how it all seemed to be, one house is really nice, the one next door, not so much. No problems to report here though. The staff was pleasant and the chickens that seem to live there made us laugh more than anything. The breakfast was simple, yes, but more than many hotels offer. They also have free wifi in the pool area which was unexpected. The parking issue that is mentioned frequently, didn't really phase us. We found an open spot on the street and stayed there for 7 nights we were there. The gym is a weight room, no cardio, that is used by the public that work with a particular group of trainers. This causes the room to be quite cramped when trying to get a morning workout in.

Our room was a queen superior which meant we had a bathroom inside our room. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only downside was the roosters. Key West has many chickens that were originally bred to cockfight still roaming the streets. One rooster near the property was crowing every couple of hours even in the middle of the night. This was not under the control of the hotel and I do not blame them for this in any way. However, I recommend bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper. One flaw that should be noted is the breakfast. It is a continental breakfast consisting of yogurt and bagels served outside by the pool. I would think that for the price of the room a hot breakfast could be served.

The Lighthouse Court is in a perfect location. One block off mid-Duval, so it is a 10 -15 minute walk to Fort Zachary Taylor Park, Mallory Square, Southernmost Point, and right across the street from the Hemingway House. It is also right near Blue Heaven, one of my favorite restaurants of all time. There is a nice courtyard, with a heated pool, and plenty of chaise lounges for relaxing in the sun. The breakfast was fine - bagels, english muffins, juice, coffee, oranges and coffee. We were able to use the property's free parking and not have to worry about our car the entire weekend. We were on a pretty tight budget, and didn't plan to spend much time at our hotel, so we booked a \"budget room\" for two nights at $120/ night plus tax and service. The budget part is that it is a shared bath. The bedroom was tiny and basic. We didn't need much more, as all we did was sleep there. However, we felt we were a bit misled by the website which said there are \"two bathrooms.\" There are two rooms with facilities; one with a sink and toilet and one with two showers and two sinks. The showers were fine, but there were eight of us in the budget rooms, and I did find myself in line for the one toilet at 2:15 am. I have stayed in many places with shared baths, but never with eight people for one toilet.

We had read the reviews, especially about the noise and the chickens and we never really noticed either while we were there. The buildings comprising the hotel are quite quaint, and I do believe they are in the process of further renovations to some rooms. (This may have been completed by now though.) Our room was beside the pool near the gym. My friend liked the gym area, but the a/c wasn't working while he was working out. He liked the idea of working in sauna conditions, so for him, this wasn't a bad thing. Go figure! Loved the hotel location in that it wasn't on the \"strip\" per se, but close enough to walk to. Lots of places were within walking distance, so we did our share of that, including the southermost marker, which was down the street. Oh yeah, I did see chickens on someone's front yard while walking to the marker. :) Our room was comfortable and clean. Nothing extra special though. If I had one complaint, it would have to be with the parking because the hotel doesn't have parking at all. You take your chances on the street.
