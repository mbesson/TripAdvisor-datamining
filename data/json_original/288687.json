{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good, basic hotel Pleasant, fairly basic hotel about a mile from the centre of San Francisco. My room was nice and clean, and the furniture and bathroom appeared reasonably new. No coffee-making facilities or other frills, but that's not too surprising given the price. Breakfast consisting of coffee (no millk unfortunately, only whitener), juice and muffins/pastries is provided, and was perfectly adequate for me. Staff were pleasant, and the service good; wireless internet was also available.The location is ok, with good bus links to San Francisco airport, amongst other places. I felt reasonably safe walking to and from the city centre, particularly once I'd discovered the Folsom/4th Street route rather than 7th/Market. However, I was not keen to wander too far alone at night. Fortunately, there are a number of restaurants withing a block or two of the hotel, so this need not be a problem! There is also a small supermarket/convenience store next door.Overall, this hotel seemed to me to be a good choice for travellers looking for a base within walking distance of downtown San Francisco, but who don't wish to pay high prices. I would certainly consider staying here again, although I would also investigate options in the city centre.", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR793167488", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "winston22"}, {"Content": "very good location. good rooms. nice breakfast. a very nice hotel, located very good. nice breakfast (muffin, juice, coffe/tea).the service is fine, not incredible, but fine.parking is 12$ near the hotel or 6$ 5min walk.you can get to city center in 10min slow walk.the eara is filled with nice bars/pubs/restaurants.you get a very good worth for your money.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR809264761", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "markmyname"}, {"Content": "Great new addition to SOMA budget hotel choice. We usually stay at the Best Western or HoJo Express on Market Street (now Vagabond Inn) - but gave this new hotel a try based on price and website plus TA reviews. Great Choice. Lobby is modern and clean with friendly, helpful front desk. Coffee, juice and muffins available in the morning. No staff at night, but your room key opens the front door. Room was fine with king bed, cable TV, desk, reading chair and small bathroom with tub/shower and marble on the floor/walls. Small refrig in room was nice. Pillows could be better and the shower curtain was a bit cruddy at the bottom (although very stylish) - but we saved more than $75 per night over the other choices in the area, so I wasn't going to complain...Would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR878882239", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Gungo2"}, {"Content": "good deal Clean and convenient.

The hotel has 2 location and I went to the one in Lombard St. - The location is perfect and if you wish and like walking - it is walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf (that in itself saved me money for parking area) specially that part of the tourist attraction - Close to the beach. :)The outside is not much and deceiving - Rooms are clean, and big. The front desk is efficient, friendly and transactions for check in and out - was fast. The room has all the ammenities like mini microwace, fridge and cable - there is remote control - stored in front desk for they said that the remote usually gets stolen... There is even ironing board and an iron inside my room. Like that unhappy person mentioned about the shower - their shower works - like me I just did not know how to turn it on.I ENJOYED MY STAY AND WOULD RECOMMEND PLACE -", "Date": "Oct 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR758964643", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Hugachefeh"}, {"Content": "Perfectly good I was very wary after reading the first review below, but the price was tempting, so I booked one night. After I checked in and saw the room, I immediately booked two more nights and then the entire following week; it was that good a value. The person below must have thought they were booking a Marriott... it is not; it is an economy accommodation and a good one at that.The hotel is simple, but very clean and comfortable. Everything is new: the paint, the beds and linen, the carpets, the furniture, the iron and board. It did use to be a hostel, but they've done an excellent job in renovating when they converted into a hotel. The rooms are not terribly large but will comfortably house two guests. They also have a few large suites. They really should hurry up and put up a new name sign on the building; they still have the Globe Hostel sign up.There are the little quirks of a newly-opened place: in some rooms they forgot to refresh the paint inside the bathroom cabinet; but the fixtures are all new and spotless. The window shades are cheap and some are already cracking, but with the thick attractive double curtains - that's not an issue really (they should probably just removed the shades altogether). They should keep the TV remotes in the rooms rather than have to ask for one from the front desk.The location is quite a hike from the touristy places, but bus #12 around the corner will take you there. There are no homeless in the immediate area, and besides the bar downstairs, it's really quiet (ask for a room in the back away from the bar).The front desk people are nice, especially Marvin who seems to always be there.The guests are mostly pleasant middle-class tourists. The neighboring buildings are clean modern lofts and townhouses.Parking is only available a block away, but if you're just staying overnight and will be leaving before 8AM then you can park on the street.Breakfast is lousy, consisting of greasy muffins and coffee. Excellent full breakfasts are available at the restaurant around the corner and at the cool Brain Wash cafe-laundromat across the street. Brain Wash has other great food and live performances for you to enjoy while you do your laundry. Get a $1 coupon from the laundry attendant for use at the cafe.Go on the hotel's website and get a free membership which will allow you to book at a significantly discounted rate. Booking on their website also allows you to cancel up to 24hrs ahead with no charge, unlike Expedia or other websites that impose a cancellation fee.Bottom line: good value for the money for an economy hotel, safe and clean.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR723574995", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "zbenye"}, {"Content": "Great Place and value Me and 2 friends flew in on the 7th and the front desk checked us in very fast and was curteous. The palce used to be called the globe hostel and the only sign showing that it was americas best value inn was a banner in the window, but that wasnt a problem. We got to our room and I was very surprised to how clean it was. Ive stayed in a hostel before and it was 2 beds, a bathroom and wasnt the cleanest place, but this room however was more like a standard hotel, 2 beds nicely made, a clean floor, a drawer and mirror and even a table and chair. the bathroom also had marble flooring and a hair dryer. There was even daily maid service coming in to clean the room and bathroom daily which is something you dont even find in motels alot of times. the front desk was friendly in calling cabs for us when needed and there werent any homeless people until a few blocks down, and at night just to get into the main doors you needed to swipe a room key to get in for added protection. The only downside was the ac wasnt hooked up yet becuase of remodeling but with the cool temps in SF you could open the windows and itd be just fine.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR532671640", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "xtremearn"}, {"Content": "A Hotel Experience to Forget NOTHING IS ACCEPTABLE at this hotel, which seems like a family business. It was a child of about 10 years of age who checked us in. The lobby is small, looks very old, and unclean. The shower and telephone did not work; the TV doesn't even have a remote.
