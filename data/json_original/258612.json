{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Terrible experience The Hotel is very very hard to find. We spent more than one hour wandering in the streets next to it. No one was able to lead us properly.The hotel itself is old and newly renovated (not properly renovated). We asked for quadruple bedroom. it wasnt spacy for 4 persons.Room was dirty, foot prints on the wall, blankets not so clean and the most awful experience was the washroom! the shower was old and the water started running till the bedroom after the first shower.after this bad experience, we didnt want to check the breakfast and we left as soon as we could.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR673369357", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Tatiana_Michel"}, {"Content": "Great central hotel We were offered this hotel when our original hotel could not accomodate a triple. We had a great room with 3 twin beds and a balcony that overlooked the street. It was spacious and the breakfast was ample.

Overall, we would recommend this hotel to other travelers.", "Date": "Aug 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR143359392", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "lashaker"}, {"Content": "A good option I did choose the Bonifacio when I find the Villino was full. Not was a bad decission. The Bonifacio is a small and recently renovated hotel. In my case, I had a single room, which was really spacious. The bed was single size but it was really comfy, actually is one of the very few hotels I slept deeply since the first night, there was also TV, and a working desk. My room faced into a inner patio where the aircon engines were placed. They are quite noisy, so you have to sleep with the windows closed (once closed, you listen nothing). And taling about the air conditioning, is a curious one. You can't really adjust the temperature but is always ok. There is also a in-room safe (mine was out of order). The room is also quite spacious, but don't expect much bathroom amenities. The hotel is placed in a quiet street just in front of the Swedish Embassy around 10 min. far from the Duomo or the Airport-bus-station. The street which will take you to the center is a pedestrian area full of live. The are is also full of restaurants and bars (even a public market).The staff is really really kind. From the manager to the bar waiter (Sandro). They are the best!The only bad thing I found was that the hot water was not really hot the last day. The breakfast isn't also great, but for my taste, was enough.", "Date": "Sep 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR602049674", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Xaf"}, {"Content": "Great find in Florence...stay here! This was a wonderful find and one of our favorite hotels on our 16 day trip.Location: Quiet, very safe neighborhood, which was a great relief from the city center. 10 minute walk from the city center, 5 minutes to the Accademia (to see David).15 minute easy walk to to the train.Room: Huge! Even by US standards. Beautiful room, sitting area and bathroom with a great and large shower. We had a balcony (for the regular rate) that overlooked the breakfast garden. Comfortable bed.Only downside: the bedroom doors in the hall slammed very loud - this was unavoidable because they are heavy, but it is not that bad. Service: The most friendly and helpful staff. Gave great food recommendations and directions. A beautiful breakfast room in and outside along with a garden and friendly breakfast staff.Tips: Stay here, it is nice to have a respite from the busy city of Florence. Bring good walking shoes and you can walk everywhere in Florence.If you like a bigger breakfast, bring instant oatmeal and a tupperware filled with peanut or almond butter.", "Date": "Jun 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR502287097", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "travelgrl048"}, {"Content": "A little gem This was a great little hotel close to the centre of Florence and within walking distance of many of the cities sights.
