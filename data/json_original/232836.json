We always had hot water and clean towels. The breakfast included is modest but also good: we had milk, juice, coffe, (great) croissants, regular bread, jams and butter. I also have to say that it is a very quite place, good for those who want to rest. Because it is near the termini station, it was very easy to catch the bus and subway, and that's so helpfull you cannot imagine.

How on earth it is classed as a three star hotel I do not know. I have stayed in a far better 1 star hotel that charges the same price for three nights that the Quisisana charges for one. No wonder this was the only hotel left in Rome on our arrival. The quality of the rooms was very basic. On arrival the hotel looks as you would expect. Clean, marble reception. However, get past this and you will see it for what it really is - a dump. I feel well and truly ripped off spending a night here. Walking up to the rooms (the lift was incredibly tiny & slow) to the fifth floor you begin to feel as if you are staying in some filthy, run-down hostel, not a 3 star hotel this claims it is. Fag butts were littered up the stair well, graffiti covered the wood work in the lift area, holes in the celing. It is truly awful. Getting to our room was not much better. A wet stain in the corner of the room, no shower curtain in the bathroom. Overall it was shabby and I really believe the Quisisana should either be reclassed or they seriously need to shut this place and spend some money on it. Please do not stay here.

It was supposed to be the most romantic weekend of our lives, as my partner proposed whilst on holiday. Rome was amazing, we enjoyed every second of our holiday, OUTSIDE of the Hotel. The photos on the website are a JOKE! Once you get past this staged lobby, it really does get considerably worse.. there was no carpet on the stairs, their was graffiti all over the walls as there looked to have been no wall paper for quite some time. There was electrical wires hanging from the wall where there should have been lamps, if you were lucky enough to find a lamp the shade was ripped. There was a gapping hole in the wall where the electric mains were kept, as well as other numerous holes. We only found this website by chance after booking for the Hotel Quisisana, we tried to change hotels but had no luck. After consideration we decided to give it a go. What a big mistake. The staff were unfriendly (we never did find out what time breakfast was, and became to afraid to ask!), the room had not been made from the last guests stay, so we had to ask the maid to clean it, the wardrobe and air con' was broken and the pipes of the hotel banged long into the night.... well at least we thought it was the pipes! It all became very amusing and it still became the most romantic weekend we have had.

We were highly looking forward to it having never been to Rome before. We had booked a twin room but on arrival discovered we had been allocated a double bed instead of two singles! We complained to the receptionist but were told that it was the only available room left in the hotel that night and to come back in the morning. The next day we were moved to another room which although did have two single beds, was in appaulling condition. The wallpaper was hanging off the walls, the door was unsecure and it was flithy. Breakfast was advertised as being of a continental style but we have never had such a lack of choice in any other European hotel we have stayed in. All it consisted of was cups of cornflakes (no bowls in sight!) and awful dry pre packed croissants. The coffee was also disgusting! The staff were all unhelpfull to us during our stay and non of our concerns were addressed.

It is officially a 2 star hotel, not 3 as was erroneously mentioned in another review. Close to major transport hub, but my guess is this would be considered a rather seedy location for some. However, if you planning on going all over, there is a straight shot to anywhere from the nearby Termini Station via bus, tram, taxi or subway. Plus getting to and from the airport is an absolute snap, with practically front door drop off. While the hand held shower is listed as an amenity, it actually is quite a pain. It would make sense for those with 3 arms, but for us normal folks, it's a bit inconvenient. The problem is that, it is exclusively hand held, i.e. no fixture which means a little bit of carelessness can send the water flow right into you change of clothes and getting clean while managing the shower head can be quite the juggling act. I'm not sure what they mean by satellite TV since we only had 3 channels. Not really a problem though because you're not in Italy to watch TV. Some of the staff were quite friendly and others a little grumpy. Tell your friends if they wish to contact you in your hotel room, Italian should be spoken. Otherwise you're liable to get hung up on. Don't expect a lot of English, but rather just enough to get you into your room and perhaps a glass of wine in the cafe. Though the night clerk will probably be asleep if you get back to your hotel after midnight, don't feel bad about waking him. He will let you in with a smile on his face. The phones have no direct dial to the front desk, so if you forget to leave a wakeup call before bedtime, you either make a local call to the hotel from the line(if you can figure out how to use it), or run down to the front desk in your jammies. If your planning on getting back late, esp. on friday or saturday, prepare for a little \"color\", as pushy prostitutes and drunken teens will be noticable, if not a complete spectacle. The included continental breakfast was delightful, and definitely worth getting up early for. They will give you American Coffee(an extreme rarity in Italy) or whip you up an espresso or capuccino if you ask. Italy is not known for inexpensive hotels but all in all, for the traveler at heart, the Hotel Quisisana is completely satisfactory, if a little overpriced.

However, there were no apologies for any inconvenience or information stating this was the case when we booked.

In the room, the TV didn't work, light bulbs needed replacing, the hairdryer didn't work, the shower (lovely hot water) had to be hand held, the shower curtain needed throwing away. We complained when the air conditioning broke down and although it was seen to, it hardly gave out any cold air.
