We stayed at Domus Mariae for 4 nights. The room was a standard one, small enough.When trying to connect to the wi-fi we were told that it is free only in the lounge, and in the room you have to pay for it. We barely could walk between the bed and the TV as there was almost no room. The bathroom was ok, not too small, the towels were clean, we received every day clean towels and the shower gel,shampoo, etc were restocked every day. The only inconvenient about the bathroom is that the the valve from the sink was rusty. You could hear the people from other rooms, also when walking on the corridor. Breakfast was pretty good, the staff was ok, they spoke english well and they were willing to help us if we needed any info about public transportation or anything else. The hotel had a nice huge garden. Very close to the metro station.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crewe, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThis was an awful place\u201d", "Author": "Anna G", "ReviewID": "UR127031275", "Content": "The hotel was deadfall, if you like coach parties and a soulless atmosphere then go there. The 'dining room' was like a canteen. At breakfast although there was a good choice it seemed that all anyone wanted to do was eat as much 'free' food as possible it was noisy and the staff were far from attentive. The assistant manager was pleasant. The rooms overlooked the most awful courtyard with filthy walls. The lift broke on the first day and was not fixed in the four days we were there. The room was dusty on arrival and very unwelcoming. The beds were so hard they made our hips ache and the pillows were like concrete. When booking into a four star establishment a certain level of comfort is expected there was none in the public areas either. We felt as we were there basically to fill the rooms. The floors were of stone and the noise from the rooms above was dreadful. Echoing voices stomping feet and you could hear every flush of all the toilets as well as what was deposited in them. The party on the upper floor left at 4.30 am and we could hear avery word, shower, toilet and then case being manoeuvred out of slamming doors. We could not have been more disappointed. Do your self a favour and give this one a miss.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTop Class Hotel And Staff\u201d", "Author": "Ar151269", "ReviewID": "UR126703268", "Content": "Wkend trip, wil def go bk. Arrived sat evening check in took 5 minutes. Room very cosy and warm. Fridge full of drinks but chargeable. Hairdryer in room. Shower is very powerful and hot water all the time. Cleaning service was top class, no complaints at all... English speaking receptionists at ur service 24/7.. Breakfast has lots of varietes.. Full English and lots of different dishes... No complaints again..really enjoyed it and worth every penny.... 4star hotels charge 3 euros per night stay(tax).. Car hire go for fiat 500....cheap ride , small and very comfortable..(don't forget cd's coz we did)...:( If u coming by car type via aurelia on Tom Tom and hotel is situated on ur right 300 yards before u c a McDonald's..McDonald's Is open till 5 am...5.90 euros for a meal... Metro tube 5 minutes away.. Tickets can be bought from tobacco shop next to mcdonalds or on site machines in station.. To c most iPod Rome in a sort time(wkend), get off at Barberini on the A line(red) and that will take u to trevi de fountain and the rest is all close by. BEWARE of pick pocketing as our purse went missing. Try not to carry a handbag Best to have a little purse in front pocket and if u do carry a handbag then make sure it's zipped up. Drinks are expensive at restaurants , we ended up paying 2.50 for a can of Pepsi. For e-tickets that r prebooked online and issue u with boarding pass (Ryan air), they do mention only 10 kg alowed, but u can carry more as suitcase is not weighed at all. Just make sure the size is right... There's lots to shop and do haggle in shops...shop near central r very expensive. Best to shop a little further away. We managed to go central at 3 am, very safe and very different without the crowd and a totally awesome atmosphere... Overall an awesum trip. After a few days kinda gets boring as all buildings start looking the same..its one I'd those places u wud like to remember and revisiting wont keep that memory spark alive..I'd visit again in a few years... Piece of advice, u allowed to carry food but no liquids so a sub kept me going till I found a place to eat at ESP late at night... On ur return , buy water /coffee/tea or snacks after immigration as it costs double in duty free..machines are situated at boarding gates....Ryan air cost was pricey too so best to carry snacks n chocolates in ur bag..", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Watford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "ma-and-na", "ReviewID": "UR126528994", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights, in Standard room with breakfast (2 ppl).

The Hotel is lovely the breakfast is AMAZING!!! beds are comfy its very clean in the rooms, showers and bathrooms were very good - staff were very friendly and very helpful with anything that we queried. It was very close to the cornelia stop on the metro and very easy to access central rome. A pizzeria very close by is called Pizza Design and I would also recommend this as a must stop place if you are staying in this hotel. We would def go back. The only small thing I could point out is if the walls were painted inside this could be very easily taken as a 5 star hotel.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotherham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPaula - looking forward to my return\u201d", "Author": "Paula U", "ReviewID": "UR125689648", "Content": "Stayed here last year in March for a second timeand found the hotel and its staff to be excellent which is why we are returning again on 10/3/12.

There are many shops, markets, bars and restaurants nearby which are much cheaper than those around Romes amazing sights and attractions. We found our room to be very clean and comfortable and was well equipped. The shower was roomy and always hot, no matter what time of day we used it.

The metro station (Cornelia) is just around the corner, buses go from there too. (Day pass on the metro is 4 euro) Their staff were great, let us check in a bit early, which was great as we had been travelling from 1am! 20mins on the metro to the city centre,although there was work being done building Linea C while we were there so it was closing quite early in the evening. A cab from the city cost us about 18 euro. Breakfast was great...bread, fruit, eggs, meat, cereal, tea, coffee, juice...the usual! There is a restaurant and you could sit in the courtyard for drinks or food. We came back late-ish one night and our lovely friend whose name we never got, insisted that we had a drink outside, even though he had just closed it up and we said we didn't mind sitting inside. He was so friendly and warm and we couldn't have felt more welcome! Nice wine, nice fries, beautiful buidling, very grand! The rooms themselves were fairly basic...but it's only somewhere to sleep and they were perfectly comfortable and had a fridge and a kettle so I was happy. The grounds are lovely too. There's also a big market just to the left when you come up the long driveway where you can buy fresh bread, cheese, meats, fish...all you need for a picnic in the park!!!", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Domus Mariae Palazzo Carpegna", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d258995-Reviews-Domus_Mariae_Palazzo_Carpegna-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$106 - $249*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Aurelia 481</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00165</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> (Formerly Grand Hotel Palazzo Carpegna)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "258995", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/1a/fb/d0/hotel.jpg"}}
