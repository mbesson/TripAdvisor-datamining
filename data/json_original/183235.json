We stayed for two nights at the beginning of April 2012. We arrived by taxi directly from the Montreal airport and the service at the reception desk was very friendly. Our room was a king size bed room located at the 10th floor. The room was quite and on the backside of the hotel. The cleanness was okay but could be better. Some old hairs in the bathroom as well as old carpet and old curtain have shown the age of the hotel. So in total the hotel is an old hotel what could and should be updated in the next year(s). What we really can recommend its the location of the hotel. You can do all downtown sightseeings without a car. The hotel is so well located that all interesting points are in a walking distance. So we would recommend the hotel for a short stay in the centre of Montreal if you don't expect a 4**** or 5***** service.

From a genera perspective this is an old hotel but its negativities are balanced by its location in the heart of a city's vibrant downtown. I can write a review on the following points: 1- Hotel in General The building is a huge one with large stories. Entrance is a little narrow with a small lobby and a small reception. It is expected from a 4 stars but can be refurbished to showcase a more luxurious environment. The reception is small with only two counters. Elevators are also old leading to old style corridors at each floor. 2- Rooms I was able to get a huge room as I was offered a two queen room, knowing that I was solo. It was a last minute booking and got it on time. Rooms need some serious refurbishment. Extremely old school and sometimes lack the finesse you would find in a 4 star chain. I was surprised to see an analogue AC control at the door, cable hiders running over the door, and an old style TV. The window was very small and it overlooked a residential building, so close that I was actually watching their TV. The toilets are outdated, strange distribution, they have a style which was hip back in the 60s. I was surprised to heart the loud bang of crunching pipes when my neighbor used his faucets. Everything in this hotel needs to be redone. 3- Staff Well here's where the good characteristics start showing. I would definitely give a 5 stars for the staff, their helpfulness, and talkative manner. I was greeted with the best respect ever and was explained everything I needed to know to have access to all amenities of my stay. They know exactly what to tell you. Housekeeping, room service all promote the same respectful and courteous manners which you expect from the finest chains. My compliments go to two receptionists who were really good at making me fee at home while I was checking in at 1 in the morning. 4- Location The hotel is located on Sherbrook door to door with McGill university. It is two blocks away from St. Catherines street and a block from Peel Metro station. It is located literally at the heart of all the action and offers access to the best activities in downtown Montreal. That's another 5 stars I would recommend this hotel for short stays of 2 to 3 days, everything other than that you can get better quality across the street at Omni for the same 200 dollars or just across at the Sofitel", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cI really liked it!\u201d", "Author": "helen196752", "ReviewID": "UR114676931", "Content": "Working for an law firm as an interpreter, I often have to travel in Canada and abroad.

We awoke to see mold and dirt painted over on the ceiling, a 'log' type board against the bathroom entrance (it was a step up) and was not doing its job. The bed itself was dusty and the room appeared little used. The bathroom floor was very dirty and we found hair on the bthroom counter and some red stuff in the sink; glass table tops were chipped, . When we checked out, I discussed this with the supervisor at the front desk. He listen with a bit of a smile on his face and with insincere comments. He asked why we didn't report it immediately, I asked him why he chose to put us in a one star room. There was much more conversation and in the end, he handed me a copy of my bill and said goodbye. In brief, I believe because we got a good online price (we booked several months in advance), we were given a converted closet quickly set up as a room in a back corner of the hotel. I do not recommend this hotel--I believe this was a bait and switch (this was a Holiday day weekend) so they could sell a 3 star room to someone else for top dollar and I am also questioning my loyalty to Best Western Hotels.

Overall, we found the staff very pleasant, professional and capable. We also picked this hotel due to its location...in the heart of Montreal. Given that getting any hotel room over this busy weekend, we felt that the $289/night cost acceptable. We would not pay this amount over regular weekends. We felt that the hotel needed some serious updating. There is a large section of plywood covering the roof of the cafe in front of the hotel. The windows don't open more than 2 inches...probably because we were on the 3rd floor (#309) and the hotel must have experienced some problems with drunken customers. Anyway, the bathroom was very low rent...actually had the large light plastic cover fall and hit my wife on the head. Luckily, she wasn't really hurt but startled to say the least. There was also a loud banging noise 2 of the 3 nights that woke us up. I notified the staff and it didn't occur on the last night. The furniture was dated and relatively clean. There is no safe in the room. They do have a safe deposit box located at the front desk but we opted to not use it. The onsight restaurant has a Lebanese cuisine for the most part. The cost of liquor is very high...perhaps due to the weekend. They do have a breakfast buffet...$15 per person. Not a great amount of items to select but it was ok for us.

We were told that was fine, and again if we wanted to leave our luggage in the car, that was fine to do so since we had access to our car at any time. So we handed the car over to the valet and left the luggage in the car.

He then started began a 10 minute long tirade about another staff member not completing his work correctly. Meanwhile we waited; at no time did he let the person on the line know he had CUSTOMERS waiting to be checked in. At the end of the call he didn't apologize to us for the wait. As a customer, the last thing I want is to wait while the front desk manager complains about his job. He then got off the phone and another call came in, he picked it up and took the call, this time from another customer calling from their room. We waited again. But this time we mentioned to him, that we were customers and that he should finish serving us before serving another customer. We had expected him to pick it up and ask the person to please hold while he finished attending to our check in. He then proceeded to argue with us, letting us know that we were not priority as we were checking in. He didn't apologize, but was rude and held no respect for the customers in front of him. We asked him when he was going to ring for the bell staff so we can get our car. He told us we had to get the bell staff ourselves. We made mention that the service was lacking and we would address the issue in the morning. He didn't care and told us to \"do whatever we wanted\". When we went to give our ticket to the Bell staffer, he asked me rather rudely why we didn't leave our luggage behind. I said we were told we could leave it in the car and we had access to it any time of day. He then corrected me and said I should have left it behind. I told him that we were not told this earlier. He very begrudgingly went to get our car. In the morning when we went to check out, we let the morning front manager know what had happened the night before. He said he would speak to the staff member. So we checked out gave our car ticket to the bell staff. We were in our car about to drive away when a bell staff member knocked on our window, and started asking aggressively why we didn't tip them, he FRIGHTENED us, we were two women in the car, and he was an aggressive Male we gave him $5, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really feel we should have. First of all, we paid $25 for parking that we hadn't expected to pay and assumed as with most places gratuities were included. Second, it is NEVER acceptable to demand a gratuity - it is at our discretion if and when we give one. After we left, we felt awful, frustrated and annoyed at how the staff members treated us. At each customer contact point the hotel failed. We were guests at this hotel. We were charged without being told of a fee, we were treated with no respected from the night manager and the bell staff.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cI would've rather slept on the street\u201d", "Author": "JulieMarie21", "ReviewID": "UR73332423", "Content": "Well, let me start from the beginning... When we arrived at the hotel we thought there would have been underground parking and turned into the alleyway behind the hotel, instead of Best Western parking, there was McGill parking. Along with this nice gift was the horrid stench of disgustingness, not even just garbage it was absolutely disgusting and the smell stayed in my car for about 10 minutes. We turned around and went back on the street and finally saw the Valet Parking sign in front of the building, so to our lovely surprise we realized that we had no choice but to use this \"Valet Parking\" service. After we parked in front of the building we stood for a few minutes but the stench from the alleyway had drifted to the front so we decided to check in before we died. I waited outside for the guy to come \"valet park\" my car and waited about 15 minutes until he finally came to me and said are you ready? Of course i was ready i had been waiting 15 minutes, since there was only one valet parking attendant working on this busy saturday. When we went inside to his \"valet\" booth he asked for the ticket, which we did not have because the really smart employee at the front desk failed to ask my boyfriend if he would be using the \"valet parking\" service. So we had to wait even longer for him to go get the ticket. Before the valet guy got in my car he asked \"is that all?\" We had no idea what he was talking about and assumed he wanted a tip which he clearly didn't deserve. Then he sped away with unnecessary speed. (The \"Valet Parking\" ended up costing 28 $ without the tip, what a waste of money) When we finally made it to the 16th floor using the elevator that looked like it was wrapped in tin foil, we went to our friends room first and when they opened the door the first thing that came to my mind was \"This is so weird\". Their room was very oddly shaped, there was a hall type thing that led to the bed, the lighting was very dull, same with the wallpaper, and it made me feel very depressed. We discussed this and we all felt the exact same way. The bathroom was not very nice and the windows were complete crap, they didn't even slide properly and would get stuck when we opened them. After seeing my friends' room i was pretty scared to see what our room would look like. Well it was completely different. It was very small and there was a king size bed in it that took up almost the entire room, so there was barely any room to walk around. Our bathroom wasn't nice either and the shower was pretty much made of plastic. The bed was okay in comfort. Which is really the only good thing i can say about this hotel. Both rooms were fairly old fashioned and slightly hideous. The \"valet parking\" guy had given us a slip to identify our car and on the bottom was a number you were supposed to call when you wanted your car. A few minutes before we were going to check out my boyfriend tried to call the number and it was not in service. So after checking out we had to wait again for our car. And the new \"valet guy\" forgot to give me my car keys and went back inside with them so i had to go ask him for them. Overall I REALLY disliked this hotel and i have no idea how it got a 3 star rating on this site, let alone a sign on the outside of the hotel that says 4 stars. WHAT A JOKE.

My husband and I shared a room with two friends, and, up until after we checked out, everything was great. The room was spacious, the beds were comfortable, and when we asked for additional towels (there were only three for four people), they were provided. After checking out, I realized that we had forgotten some items in the closet in the room, and we returned to the hotel after we left the Jazz Festival and on our way home. When I asked the evening staff if I could retrieve my items, I was rudely advised that their policy was that only the executive housekeeper can access the Lost and Found, that this person was not available, and that Lost and Found had closed for the day. Upon asking why this was their policy, I was subjected to a lengthy monologue about it being ridiculous for me to anticipate that I would be able to retrieve lost items at any time of day. I was then advised with a sneer that they could send me my items by Purolator, but that I would have to cover the cost. I found this unacceptable, given that I was standing in front of the desk staff at the time. It makes little sense that I would be required to pay for shipping when they were unable to simply retrieve the items when I was there in person. My husband and I escalated our request to have shipping fees waived in light of the situation to the Director, Salem Tohme. He refused to return three messages left by my husband, instead referring the call to a \"coordinator\" who simply emailed my husband their shipping rates and a form for us to fill out with credit card information (which was already on file as I used mine to pay for the room) in order for them to ship the items. It was only when I left a long and detailed message that I received a phone call from the Director, who advised me very rudely that \"well, it is your choice, ma'am\" if I chose not to stay there again. It was obvious that the Director deemed our concerns to be a waste of his time. At a different hotel in Montreal, my husband left his cellphone charger in our room, and said hotel shipped it to us at no cost, no questions asked. I have to wonder where the Best Western Ville-Marie gets its customer service training. Clearly, I do not intend to stay at this hotel again.

When I called back at 12pm when we got to Montreal it was their colleague Julie who said that she could put aside a great room for us(as we were already going to be charged anyway) and she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let us down, even though we only checked in at 4pm that great room on the 18th floor with a view on of the mountain was on hold for us. Now let me tell you about check in. It was Peter saying \"anything you want sir we are at your service\". He looked at me and suggested clubs and VIP line bypass and gave us a rundown of the events in Montreal that weekend. From the Firework competition to the Comedy Festival and even restaurants and getting around the city on their METRO. I am 32 and I come in from Toronto with my Mom to visit my sister and some friends I had met in Cuba over the last year. So it was different things that we wanted to do, but they were upto the task and we had a great time. Now this was the only bigger hotel that acted like the small Bed &Breakfasts where the owners tell you where to go and what to do. In the larger Hoity Toity joints I would have probably got a great cooperate rate but I have never liked dealing with the snotty Concierges, who make you feel like they are opening the gates of heaven to me by giving you confidential info. The only drawbacks were just the added cost of $10/night if you wanted a mini fridge brought to the room and 88cents+12cents(tax) so that was ONE DOLLAR PER LOCAL CALL. This is ok if you make just a couple of calls but my sister and many friends are Montreal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soo that added up like a drink bill on a cruise ship. Then the only other thing was that if you wanted a room with 2 double beds it was 8 bucks more even if you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any more than 2 people staying in the room. So now you are probably saying this is nothing just a bit more but \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it can add up very quickly and mean about $40 more at checkout. This is something that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see at any other 4star hotel but this is what makes me think of this place as a Best Western. Only annoying thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Getting ICE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 19floors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but ice machines only on 4 floors. That means if you want a COLD drink at any given time you more than likely will have to take an elevator to get some ice. But I will still be back at this hotel, why? STAFF, LOCATION and SERVICE I will just bring up a cooler and tell everyone to call me or bring my voice over IP with laptop.", "Date": "July 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Millville, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5007976", "Content": "On a recent trip to Canada, my husband and I took a train to Montreal.

We booked somewhat in advance and did not have any issues getting a non-smoking room. Our room was clean and there were no maintenance problems. The lobby of this hotel is very nice, although it was a little more spread out / strangely configured than most hotel lobbies. The lobby had a very nice chandelier and fountain. There is a valet / concierge when you enter. It is definitely much nicer than your typical Best Western. -------------------------------- WHAT WE LIKED: The staff!!! The two staff, Peter and Rami were outstanding!!!! They bent over backwards to discuss sightseeing ideas, restaurants, directions and to make reservations for us. They were INCREDIBLY friendly and helpful. I received the type of service from them that I would expect at a five star hotel like the Ritz Carlton. The location was great! It is located a couple of blocks from the Metro, it was very close to the top restaurants in the city and to the beginning of the shopping area. Since it was centrally located, a lot of the places we went were walkable to us (e.g., the old city), although some people who don't like walking may think otherwise. There was a very nice Lebanese restaurant adjoining the hotel as well as a caf\u00c3\u00a9. The restaurant seemed a lot nicer than restaurants in other hotels of this price range. For what you received, you couldn't beat the price in Montreal. Just book far enough in advance with the understanding that depending on who/where you book it from, the price will vary dramatically -- you have to bargain hunt for discounts. We paid less than $125 / night. ----------------------- WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE: During our stay, we happened to be across the street from the Omni hotel staff strike. Our room/window was facing the Omni Hotel. With that in mind, they were playing loud music and screaming through megaphones. Although they didn't picket late at night or real early in the morning, it was early enough to be our wake-up call. NOTE: This is not the hotel's fault and there is nothing they could do about this.", "Date": "December 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay at this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "freq_flyer08", "ReviewID": "UR3814713", "Content": "This hotel was the worst hotel we have ever stayed at. My friends and I had an exciting weekend planned in downtown Montreal. We had originally booked a non-smoking room. I guaranteed it using my credit card. When we arrived at the hotel, which was at about 2:30 am, we found out there were no non-smoking rooms available. The person at the desk told me that I did not reserve a non-smoking room. He then blatantly lied to me that he checked the reservation system. Because when I called Best Western, they checked and it clearly said NON-SMOKING. Anyways we had to settle for a smoking suite. We soon realized that the suite had a leaking ceiling. They told us they would work on the ceiling. In addition, the room was extremely musti and one of my friends had an asthma condition. Because of the smoke, she was not in the best shape. They then promised us another room. They explicitly told us that we could get another non-smoking room as a room had cleared up. But then when we got back to the hotel after a few hours, they said they had fixed the ceiling and that there were still no rooms available. The hotel did absolutely nothing for us. They couldn't move us to another room because the hotel was packed. For our troubles they gave us a $25 credit for the cott we used. In addition they gave us a complimentary suit cover that said Best Western. We were not impressed. We filed a complaint with the Best Western Customer Service. The general manager replied that there was nothing else he could do. The general manager explicitly told me \"Sir we had to maximize our revenue that night.\" Please do not stay here. This hotel doesn't deserve squat. They do not deserve to be licensed. They do not deserve to be standing on the ground they are on. In the end, Best Western Customer Service, gave us 2 free nights by crediting us Gold Crown Points. The hotel is independently owned so they can do whatever they choose to do to their customers. Best Western Customer service was even surprised at how poorly the hotel handled the situation. The general manager is simply not a nice person and has no feelings towards his customers. These are the plain facts.
