We just stayed four nights at this hotel. We had a great rate of about $200/night per room (we had 2 rooms 1 with 2 queens and 1 with a king)The rooms are small but adequate. I am sure there are much smaller rooms in NYC No fridge or microwave unlike most Hampton Inn's. Flat screen tv. Breakfast again not as many choices as other out of the city Hampton Inns. Very very small bathrooms.Staff very helpful and pleasant. Rooms clean although we came back one day around 5pm and room still not cleaned. However it was thendone quickly.Location- great for getting around. Subway mere steps from hotel. Macey's the same. I will say the choice of restaurants was fairly limited within short walking distance.For the price we would stay there again", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR319783121", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "momtoemma"}, {"Content": "Great hotel and staff My wife, daughter and I have just returned from our first trip to New York and absolutely loved it!The Hampton Inn was perfect.

Excellent value - Hampton Inn has great weekend rates. The location is half a block from a subway station, one block to Macy's, and three blocks to Madision Square Garden.
