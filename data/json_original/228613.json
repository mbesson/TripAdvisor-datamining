Upon arrival at the airport, we were unable to figure out how to call the hotel shuttle to come pick us up - so we ended up taking a cab, which was 15 euro for a 10 minute trip. They gave us a bed in room #5, an upper room in the little \"casita-style\" houses they show on their website. The room was in pretty poor condition for a 4-story hotel. The bed was the hardest I've ever slept on, the air conditioning did not work well, and the room, overall, was very dated. It needed a big upgrade. I did not sleep well those nights. We had requested a king size bed, but ended up with two smaller beds, which was okay because we just pushed the two beds together. After reading the other reviews, I had expected the hotel staff to be disinterested, but found them to be fine -- friendly even. The pool area was very nice, the breakfast was really excellent. The walk to the metro was about 10-15 minutes, followed by a 20 minute ride do the center of Madrid (Sol). Then, upon returning to Madrid after visiting Valencia, we were given a different room, room 103, which was in the main building at the end of a pretty walkway - past all the little casita-style rooms. This room was much better. The room looked cleaner, with a much better bathroom. The air conditioner worked very well, the bed was softer. We were much more satisfied with this room. The pool and breakfast were, once again, excellent, and the staff was even friendlier the second time. The shuttle ride to the airport was easy and quick, and the driver was very friendly. I think that with a little upgrading, the hotel would really shine. They seem to need to replace their beds. All in all, I would recommend this hotel if you do not need or want to be in the center of Madrid -- it comes with a good price, good pool, great breakfast, and shuttle service which will, at least, work one way.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cBED BUGS\u201d", "Author": "edededed", "ReviewID": "UR107924965", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel to end our trip to Spain.

From the front end reception to the room cleaning & maintenance, right through to the shuttle driver loudly playing his personal CD's, this hotel's management is in need of attention to guest service skills. Unfortunately, the quality of our hotel room was even worse than the guest service. Though there may be better rooms somewhere within the complex, this is definitely not a 4 star property throughout, but more like a 2 star motor lodge, with room doors opening onto the the parking laneway. Our room, in particular, should have been removed from the hotel's inventory due to serious water damage that caused mold, mildew & a lifting and twisting of the laminate flooring to the point where there was a gap under the exterior door. The supplies were lacking (no soap, missing bath towel), there was dried urine on the toilet seat, hair in the sink, & a used, dirty bath mat. In the morning, we had a visit from a spider. And cold water showers. The logical question would be why didn't we demand a different room? The reason: We'd already received an un-welcoming reception upon arrival, including staff inability to find our reservation, even though I had phoned by 6:00PM to say we would be arriving later. When we returned to the front desk after seeing the room, it was evident that the harried staff were busy dealing with several other guests' complaints...none of whom seemed to be receiving satisfaction. Ultimately, we were in the age-old traveller's predicament of needing a place for the night before an early morning flight. Upon check-out, I had to insisted to the non-English speaking front desk clerk on having the \"Complaint Book\". I documented the main complaints with a promise that the hotel management will be contacted. And they will be, following this warning to other travellers. So long as the expectation is a 4 star experience at the Osuna, there will be disappointment. Thus, the staff of this hotel will continue to be barraged with everyone's complaints, contributing to their bad attitude & lack of pride in their hotel. Do not book the Osuna unless your expectations are lower than a 4-star, and you are prepared to gamble that your room may or may not be tolerable.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "1", "Service": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mosta, Malta", "Title": "\u201cdisappointing\u201d", "Author": "Angelique19", "ReviewID": "UR99114076", "Content": "I stayed at Osuna hotel with clients in June 2010 for a conference nearby.

The rooms were slightly smaller than we expected as 4* but even with 3 single beds in one room there was enough space so no real complaints. The reason for saying it was not 4* is because of the peeling wall paper and dirt marks on the walls. the rooms and bathrooms were kept very clean daily by non english speaking staff, and contrary to comments on this site the reception staff were helpful and courteous especially as only my 14 year old daughter could speak basic Spanish. One real complaint, as non smokers and one member with asthma, was the lingering smell of cigarettes in reception and bar because of the smoking area close by which appeared to be unventilated.We could not really use the patio as the aquafans blew smoke in our direction also.. The airport shuttle worked well 15min wait on the way there and no rfeal wait on the way home.

The room was very small - it was a triple ( i think they used a double and just put in a single bed - but it was still 2 double beds and a single for 69 euros) but there were lots of the small luxuries like you'd expect from a 4* hotel, complimentary toiletries etc.. There's a great pool which is open from 11-8pm with shallow end perfect for children. There's also a small play park within the complex ideal for older children. The hotel is in a quadrangle shape -- with self catering apartments down 2 sides the hotel rooms round 1 other and the final side made up of the reception, bar and terrace and restaurant. In the middle is pool, green space & park. The terrace is kept fresh by atomisers and you can get tapas in the evening and it's table service.

But, if you want anything more, there are much nicer hotels for the cost throughout the city.", "Date": "March 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona", "Title": "\u201cThe most horrible stay\u201d", "Author": "Olena-TRIP", "ReviewID": "UR6516206", "Content": "This was one the worst experience ever! Starting with the very uncomfortable location (far away from any communications) and finishing with the fact that we were robbed in our room during the last night of our stay. The staff is very rude, they even could not tell us how to get to the city centre, we have to aks people in the street. When you approached the reception desk they would start telephone conversation and you had to wait for ages. The last straw was when we came back last night and the window was open and we relised that we lacked our things, we were robbed a camara and a mobile and various chargers. The reception was indifferent about the case and said that it was us who were guilty. So, that was the most horrible and unjust treatment that people staying in a 4star hotel may receive. We never recuperate anything and the hotel's presentation about the robbery was full of lies.

The rooms were pretty good and clean, the location isn't bad (about 12-15 EUR for cab into city centre or a metro but that seemed to take ages so didn't bother after trying it once), the pool OK (no sun loungers though) and the bar and food nice. Maybe it was because we were an all male party and I might be bias but we were very well behaved! We didn't make much noise, were polite and didn't cause them any problems, at least that's my view. But the problem is the male staff (the women were fine) are extremely rude and miserable not really what you really want on your holiday! There was certainly a language barrier which probably made the situation worse. I won't go into the details about some of the rudeness we had to put up with but think twice if you are English and are thinking of staying here.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Horsham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d", "Author": "meatfleece", "ReviewID": "UR3684212", "Content": "Booked this hotel as a last minute thing and after reading a previous review I became a little concerned. No need, it was extremely charming. The area around the hotel was a little worrying but I suppose it was in a city. The restaurant was of an excellent standard and the room also was very nice and clean with a marble tiled bathroom. My only disappointment was that there was no tea or coffee facilities but snacks and drinks were very reasonable at the bar area. The pool was well maintained and pleasant. It took us 20 minutes to get to the centre of Madrid using the nearby metro. The staff were polite but we had a bit of a problem trying to understand the menu as it was only written in Spanish, they did their best to translate but it was pot luck really.
