A nice place with computer in the lobby for free email, an ATM only 10 feet from the lobby door, and a nice little coffee shop about 40 feet away. Also, a grocery store half a block up. Very nice room, really clean and really nice. We got there before noon due to airline schedule, and they were nice enough to let us check in.One caution--if you are taking cab from airport, take a map for the driver. Our driver did not know where it was and actually left the cab at a red light to ask another cab driver for directions. The trip from the airport was 23 Euro, the hotel called a cab for the return to the airport and that was only 17 Euro--the desk clerk told me the drivers they use would know the better way.Desk clerks did quite well with English, were able to direct us to subway (15 minute walk) and a mall where there are some eating places (across from subway). I wished we could have stayed here on return trip and I should have booked it when I booked arrival--the rates via their web site were quite a bit higher and I could not get the departure night via Hotwire.I would gladly stay there again and would recommend this place to anyone. Very pleasant.", "Date": "Jun 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR576273484", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "JoeSchlambe"}, {"Content": "Excellent airport hotel especially in this Market Excellent value (booked via hotwire)Excellent property, well situated, absolutely impeccable, remarkably maintained and in pure spanish modern design style, good-sized room, with free wifi that works, clean, safe.

We stayed there because we wanted something rather close to the airport, and not too expensive.Funny thing is that booking though and international website of hotel deals we paid...exactly half the own hotel official best price. Keeping in mind hotels pay a fee to these websites, I find this totally stupid in terms of business management, but I am neither a owner nor a shareholder of Barcelo hotels, so I don't really care.The location is difficult to find even with a detailled map, without it or a GPS it is mission impossible. You can easily drive long the place and not note it, the parking entrance is similarly not indicated at all!The room was small but really nice, if like me you like modern, minimalist design.Even the corridors, something generally ghastly in big chain hotels, were appealing.The restaurant buffet is international, not very tasty average thing, not to be recommended...but you don't have lots of other options around. It is about 10 minutes walk from the nearest metro station that brings you to the city center in about 20 minutes. Not the most convenient location, for sure...For the price we paid (less than 90 euros including breakfast for 2) and at this 4-star quality, it was really great.

It is far from the city center but it is only a 7 minute walk to the metro. Very quiet and breakfast is fine. I really enjoyed the modern and cleanliness of it - the fact that it was out of the city didn't bother me because getting around on the metro line (direct into the city) was easy. Overall, I would stay there again and prefer it to a noisy, run-down, downtown hotel. This one was a delight and right for the price. There is a grocery store around the corner for snacks and basics, a shopping mall near the metro station with amazing gelato and the area is very quiet because it is not residential, which we didn't mind though some might.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR979486693", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "SarahParis"}, {"Content": "Nice stay in Barcelo, Madrid Nice designed hotel in Barcelona style and designGood attention", "Date": "Jun 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR892205505", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "pierrebsas"}, {"Content": "chic Paid $102 USD through hotwire with breakfast. Excellent price for the room. Room was very clean, chic and high tech, quiet, alot of samples, comfy beds. Staff was very helpful. Couldn't get internet access from our room. Downside was that our plane came in late around 10 PM, too late for two women to walk over 1 km. from the metro station to the hotel area where there is not much activity. Took a taxi from terminal 2 which the website said would be 10 Euros. Turned out to be 25 euros as there is an additional night fee and airport fee. Took taxi back to the airport at 5 AM as our flight left early. The fare was 20 euros to teminal 2 where my daughter was dropped off and an additional 5 euros to terminal 4, the international terminal. So, even though I felt the room was a value, considering the 50 euros I paid in taxi fees, I would have been better off staying near the airport with a free shuttle.", "Date": "May 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR459427806", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "WImom"}, {"Content": "Only If You Have To! I'm writing this from my room at the hotel and i must say that this place is really bizarre. It's miles away from the city center with no metro nearby so definitely don't stay here if you have any intention of exploring Madrid. You pull up to the hotel and there's no real entrance which is minor but puzzling. The area is pretty much warehouses with some car dealerships around the corner. You can walk a bit and get to a small area with shops, but if you're looking for charm, this ain't it. On the upside, the restaurant downstairs which was empty tonight wasn't too bad and the decor is quite cool despite being done on a shoestring budget.

When you arrive at the Barcelo Torre Arias you are not sure where the front entrance is. You're not even sure if you are at the right building as it looks like your average square glass office box amongst other semi-urban office boxes. When you do discover that there is indeed a front door you must then figure out how you are going to get your bags into the hotel from the street. There is no bellhop eagerly waiting to assist you. There is not even an area on the street reserved for cars to pull over and unload. Weird. We arrived in a car. After scratching our heads for a while my wife ran inside to find out where the door is. She was told we should pull into the garage and unload there. There is an entrance to the underground garage 30 or so meters in front of the building but there are no markings to indicate that it is the parking for the Barcelo Torre Arias and not the adjacent identical office building. So we pull into the garage expecting to find some sort of subterranean lobby entrance. We drive around in circles then go to the lower level. We found nothing but a few unmarked utility doors. My wife got out of the car and opened one of these doors and found a room marked Health Spa but saw no elevator. After testing a few other doors around the garage, she went back into the one where the spa was. In the vestibule, she tried another gray, unmarked utility door and found the elevator. Of course there was no one there to help with the baggage. When we finally made our way to the lobby we learn that there is a 15 Euro charge to park in the garage.We only stayed at the hotel one night and did not have time to sample the amenities such as the spa or the computer room. But I will say that the room was very nice. It was large by European standards and had many features not often found in other hotels. The decor was contemporary Euro-chic sleek and pristine in appearance. Most importantly the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom sported heated mirrors and a towel warming rack. The shower took me 5 minutes to figure out how to work. The complimentary breakfast served in the morning was nicer than most. Our only complaint about the room is that it was freezing cold and the confusing thermostat controls seemed to be ineffective at resolving this. All in all, this was a very good value for what we paid but some major changes need to be made to this newly opened hotel to make it user friendly. What were they thinking when they designed this place?Our major complaint though arose from the fact that we called for directions and were led 60km out of the way. We called back for further instructions and spoke to a different person who still could not give us correct directions. \u9225\u6dda don\u9225\u6a9b know which way you should turn, I don\u9225\u6a9b have a car\u9225?was his response. This cost us over an hour of precious vacation time -- time that we may have spent sampling the other amenities.", "Date": "Jun 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR538861856", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Muy buena estancia   showReview(20002158, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR163077074", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Tognita"}, {"Content": "Perfecto para visitar Madrid   showReview(18598082, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR922683397", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ivanparadises"}, {"Content": "BUEN HOTEL   showReview(17522471, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR743313859", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "CERMontevideo"}, {"Content": "situation excentr\u8305e   showReview(17435495, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR451343783", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "un tres bon hotel ,grand lit ,salle de bain agreable .seul bemol un peu eloigne du centre .   showReview(17435494, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR172771596", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Sehr empfehlenswert!   showReview(17435492, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR573757273", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Super Hotel !
