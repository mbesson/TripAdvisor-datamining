{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great hotel A really good value hotel in central Tokyo. The hotel is well located being only a short walk from Senso ji (Asakusa Kannon)Temple and 3 minutes walk from the subway. The hotel rooms are very small but clean and provide everything you need. The rooms are just big enough for two people. The bathroom is small but again provides everything you need. If you do not like small rooms this is not the hotel for you but if you want an inexpensive hotel the Chisun Inn is fine. I thought that it was very good value for money. We stayed on the top floor (11/F) which meant we had a reasonable view towards the river. There was free internet access in the room. Breakfast is usually not incuded in the price; there is a restaurant within the hotel which we did not try.The reception staff have limited english but it is enough to get by and they are friendly. The hotel is located on Edo Dori next to the Bandai (Power Rangers) head office, three minutes walk from Exit A1 of Asakusa subway station. Asakusa station has two subway lines but you can get to Exit A1 off only one line. If you are on the other line you need Exit 1 and the walk to the Chisun is 7-8 minutes.Ueno station and park and Ameyoke market are about 25- 30 minutes walk away. Both are a must see. Getting to other areas in Tokyo is easy on the subway; the fares which range from about Y160-260 are pretty cheap.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR618986551", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Mike_Sto"}, {"Content": "very small room very nice neat little hotel, but wow the room was small, the staff didn't speak much english but we managed without too much trouble, was quite close to some cool markets and once we worked out the public transport it was no problems getting anywhere, found the restaurant was very dear,much better off taking the short walk to near the asakusa temple and finding a feed in the market areas.", "Date": "Nov 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR227806524", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "oztourist42"}, {"Content": "Compact room, but clean at good price in Asakusa Chisun Inn was our first night in Tokyo, and we knew this was going to be a tough experience in space inside the room...so it was, quite tight, with one side of the bed glued to the wall.but our goal this time was to be on a budget, with good location, and it paid off. The location of Asakusa is actually a great place to stay your first night in TokyO: first is closer to the Narita airport than someother areas of the city, and second is the heart for the oldest temple with a great tourist experience . The Sensoji temple has a great frame of people, street stands and was quite an experience, with an easy walk to the Chisun Inn hotel.PS: there is the Asahi headquarters restaurant very nearby, better for the beer and the pictures outside the building not so much for gourmet...", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR423549556", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jomilop"}, {"Content": "Very small rooms       Temple", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR143825173", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Tipsy252"}, {"Content": "Chisun Inn Asakusa       asakusa temple", "Date": "Aug 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR760811559", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "viajador29"}, {"Content": "Fantastic find My Wife and I stayed in this hotel during our second trip to Tokyo (the first was our Honeymoon where we stayed at the ANA Intercontinental - amazing!). On this trip we also went with 3 friends. The main reason we chose this hotel was cost as a couple of our friends were on tight budget. Despite the lower price the quality of service was in no way compromised.The staff, despite the language barrier, were very friendly and went out of their way to ensure that our stay was comfortable.The rooms, though small, were clean, well maintained and had very comfortable beds which were perfect after a day out walking around Tokyos' amazing sights. The bathrooms were also very good with a fantastically deep bath which was perfect for unwinding after a long day.!Transport connections to the hotel from Narita are excellent and the hotel is perfectly placed to get to every major sight in this fantastic city due to it being at the end of the Ginza line. There are plenty of amazing little restaurants dotted about near the hotel. We found a superb family run Katsu restaurant near the Senso-ji temple which served delicious Donburi.The hotel is also near several convienience stores and the local Post Office so getting hold of emergency funds or changing travellers cheques should prove no problem. We have already booked a return trip next year and are really looking forward to staying at this hotel again.", "Date": "Aug 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR801824446", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "teddymeow"}, {"Content": "Great Location, friendly staff and adequate for a single traveller I stayed at Chisun Inn Asakusa for two weeks from Late May to Early Jun 08(just got back yesterday!). Location-wise, this place was great to commute to places like Shibuya, Roppongi, Ginza, Ueno, Tokyo Station, using the Tokyo Metro subway (there version of the tube). This is located next to BanDai Namco headquarters, where you are can view all the toys and pose next to power rangers! There is a Narita Express service Train which heads from Narita Airport to Asakusa (take Exit 1), make sure that your luggage is light as you will have to carry them up the long flight of stairs as there are no elevators/lifts in Asakusa subway station. Looking at the other reviews for this hotel I thought I'll mention that there's a McD's, denny's, kannarinon post office where you can use your debit card/credit card to withdraw cash maximum 100,000 yen only limit(total amount ). family mart a convienence to buy drinks, snacks. You can also take a tokyo boat cruise from Asakusa to Obaida - Tokyo artificial beach via Sumida River ( this is only open in the mornings/afternoon).The staff at the hotel were very friendly, also greeting there guests in Japanese and with bow. There english is limited but good enough! There are two computers in the lobby area for internet and email, a laundry room to wash and dry your clothers. They do provide a massage service which I didn't use. There's also a dry cleaning service provided here as well. They also sell international pre-paid phone calls for 1100 yens you get about 16 mins for UK calls. I did eat at the restaurant at the Chisun Inn Asakusa, for breakfast each day which was a buffet service from 7am to 9am. The food provided was a mixture of japanese and western selection such as cereal, omelets, tofu, rice, bread rolls. This was good and you can eat as much as you wanted. It also provides a lunch buffet service as well. The place is called Okinawa Dining and bar, it does open up as a bar in the evening.At the hotel you can also buy newspapers in Japanese and in English such as the Japan Times. The room was very clean and tidy. Room size was a little small enough room to put one large suitcase in there! The air-conditioning was ok, you can set your alarm clock on the headrest of the bed or use the hotel service alarm to wake you up. The room had a kettle, tea bags, refrigerator, lcd tv and lan port for free internet access if you bought your laptop with you. The TV programmes were in Japanese, you can use the VOD service for 1000 yens you can have a good selection of films in English to watch from three pm to noon the next day. There are lots of vending machines allocated in the hotel, for drinks, snacks, ice, cigarettes. You can also order a Domino's pizza at the hotel as well.All I can say is if you are looking for a hotel that's convienently located and is fairly inexpensive then this is the place. If I plan to go to Tokyo again I would definitely come back here again.", "Date": "Jun 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR245387630", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "yogobashi_akiba"}, {"Content": "Good budget accomodation in Tokyo       Hotel entrance", "Date": "May 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR329234372", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jason416"}, {"Content": "Small but super! Location is an ideal base for both Asakusa itself and for getting around Tokyo. The Sensoji temple is within walking distance as are the subway station entrances / exits and a very convenient Family Mart for snacks, drinks and meals. Loved having Bandai just down the road too, with some fantastic Ultraman and Doraemon statues outside :)Staff were efficient, friendly and spoke fairly good English. The rooms were a little on the small side, but this is typical of Japanese accommodation, so I didn't mind. Free internet access is available on 2 PCs in the lobby and a large selection of movies and TV channels are available (movies are available as a video-on-demand system at an inexpensive 1,000 yen for all-you-can-watch up until midnight). Cleaning was very well done, and both the hotel and the area were very quiet. The many vending machines throughout was the icing on the cake.
