The worst location ever! We were coming back from the city centre late at night and even though I'm not a person who gets easly scared, I was constantly looking over my shoulder. We were told there was a swimming pool and yes, there was... big, inflamable, empty paddling pool, hidden behind the scaffolding, that we couldn't access. Massive dissapointment, hence that was the reason why we've choosen this hotel! Massive mould in the shover didn't make me want to jump in and refresh after sleepless night ,due to the fact that another guest, next room decided to watch TV untill 2am. Being woken up at around 6am by other hotel guests and screeming children, is not the best start of the day but you could hope that the breakfast might make it all up for it. Not in this case! The choice of breakfast was between a dry bread roll or cheap cereals, no scramblled egg or at least a fresh fruit. We had to buy our own food and eat on the bed in our room! The only good word I've got to say is about the staff working behind the desk. They were very friendly and helpful.

There's a really good bus connection to the hotel from the metro/train station Tiburtina, so you can arrive in +- 25 minutes in the hotel. OK, the people on the bus are most of the time gypsy's, begging or smelling (also in the morning, soap allergy maybe?) but you don't feel that unsafe. OK, we were exhausted every evening because of the walking and city tripping and maybe we didn't get awoken by the traffic thanks to that. Although we slept right next to the highway. But we think it's a good hotel for budget travellers. We liked it because it had value for money. The staff was weird, sometimes nice, sometimes not so nice, but OK. Internet in the lobby was free. The rooms were really big, bathroom was really clean and had a good shower. OK, breakfast gets boring after 3 times the same things, no yoghurt's, no fruits, but it was basic. Only they put lemon on top of or in almost everything. Bah! But the only thing we wanted, was a nice swim in the swimming pool every evening after a long hot day, but it was broken. We asked every evening if it was fixed, but always the same negative answer. OK, we knew every evening when we arrived that they hadn't worked on it, but it was fun asking and always getting the same answer.

We were looking forward to this famous city and according to the reviews, to a good hotel. We were very happy when we arrived at the hotel after very long journey with the underground and bus. We didn\u00b4t expect that we would go to the hotel with the public transport from Termini station for almost 2 hours. We were waiting for more than one hour for the bus 135 (this bus should go every 20 minutes from Monday to Friday, at weekends every 30-40 minutes). Check in went quickly. We had booked a double room with full breakfast. The receptionist told us that we didn\u00b4t have breakfast. And that it was not possible that we had booked breakfast with this type of room. I showed her a printed booking certificate in there was the payment including the breakfest. After 15 minutes we have got an answer that we will have breakfest. Not full, only the Italian one. The Italian breakfest consists of brioche, coffee, tea and some cakes... I felt hungry and ickie every day after this breakfest. The other \"normal\" breakfest costs 10 euro/person extra. This hotel also offers \"free shuttle service\". Our experience with this free shutle service was unbelievable... 1) we had booked the shuttle for Saturday 10am (around 18pm on friday) 2) after 22:00 the receptionist phoned us and told us that the shuttle for tomorrow was full and that we would book for another shuttle for 11am I went downstairs. I told her that we would like to book shuttle for sunday for 9:30. I saw her to write our room on the paper for the shuttle service 3) I wanted to be sure that we would go with a shuttle to Rome, so I asked on Saturday morning if we really booked it. The receptionist answered: \"The shuttle is full and your room number is not there\". I asked her how was that possible...I saw her to write it there. She showed me the paper and our room was not there. I couldnt believe it! Do they have one paper for some guests, for the others another one? After this 3rd experience we decided not to use any other service in this hotel. We just slept there... Our room was situated to the other site (not to the main street), we didnt hear the noise from the street. Summary: rooms and the bathroom spacious and clean enough, very far from the city center on a main street with very unregular bus service, poor and expensive breakfest, polite receptionist with a bad habbit.

I am 63 years of age and my wife 58. I started planning in February-March for a 45 days trip from 22nd April to 6th June 2010. In the month of March 2010 itself, we booked one double-bed room in Hotel Romulus, Via Salaria, 1069 00138 Roma, Italy. [-]; web:www.hotelromulus.com. Wherever we stayed during this trip, my criterion was to book a hotel as near to the Railway station or city-centre as possible. However, only in Roma, I let go this basic requirement. When I saw the photos of the rooms and hotel surroundings, I decided this would be the best choice. After a tiring day of visiting tourist attractions, one must have a nice place to retire \u2013 isn\u2019t it? Yes, the hotel is about 12 kms from Roma Termini \u2013 the main Railway station. But the brochure assured excellent connectivity is available from the hotel. Later I found this to be true! Secondly, I got the best offer of Euro 44 per night for a double bed room. We reached Roma Termini on 22nd morning 1030 Hrs. from Paris by Train. Just before leaving Paris, I sent an email to Hotel Romuls to arrange for a taxi to pick us up, and within no time we got a reply confirming that a taxi would be waiting at the Railway station. She also informed that the driver will stand with a sign with my name on it at the meeting point. Later she gave another message indicating where exactly the driver would be standing, but unfortunately we had left Paris by that time and hence could not check that mail. At Roma Termini, we missed him and reached the hotel by another taxi. Though the taxi was deputed by the hotel and he was waiting in the station for some time, the hotel staff was considerate enough not to charge anything for that service. I read commentaries of tourists to Italy criticizing the cab drivers. But, our experience was a memorable one. We came across a very considerate, polite and friendly taxi driver who helped us load and unload our luggage and took a very resonable amount. Later we found that one can easily travel from Roma Termini to the hotel by train/bus even with luggage. From Roma Termini, go to Tiburtino FS by metro, come out of the station and walk across and catch bus No. 135. That is the starting point of Bus 135 and you have a bus every 20 minutes. The bus is very comfortable and you can get down just opposite to the hotel. Of course you have to climb a few steps to cross the road by pedestrian bridge. I feel the hotel must have clearly indicated this mode of transport in their website if a customer does not prefer to spend for taxi. The lounge was very impressive and the staff were friendly, ready with all info a tourist required. All of them speak English. She explained tourist attractions to be visited and the conveyance to be used with a map. She gave me another paper listing up and down timings of bus No. 135; and another brochure giving metro line routes with station names in blue and red lines. Another advantage was \u2013 there is a vending machine in the dining hall \u2013 insert a Euro and you get a ticket for using by any bus/metro upto next 75 minutes. There is also a 24 hr. coffee shop near the reception which is very useful. The rooms are very spacious and bath and WC are very good and clean. Surprisingly, they changed towels every day. We stayed 3 nights and undertook hectic visits to all the tourist attractions in Roma. I must say my stay in Hotel Romulus was a great help; because it hardly took 20 minutes to reach city centre; we used bus and metro with ease to go to Vatican, the farthest point from the hotel. Location of the hotel is a pollution free noiseless area and one can relax comfortably in the beautiful rooms. Only short-coming was dearth of restaurant arrangement in the hotel.

However, we are quite glad that it was only a short stay as it was awkward getting into the centre of Rome via the bus outside the hotel which did not follow the timetable set out and therefore was not always reliable. Once you got off the bus you had to take a metro into the centre to see the sights. Overall journey into say the Colosseum would take about an hour plus at times. There was not much around the hotel so to avoid the expensive dinners we stayed out in the centre until quite late and ate there. The hotel itself seemed nice enough. The staff were friendly and the rooms were cleaned (not thoroughly though) every day. We had breakfast included in our room deal but found it to be not that great. The croissants and bread were stale and the food tended to run out quickly so my tip would be to get there early. Other corners that were cut were the fact that our double room was made up of two single beds pushed together which made for an uncomfortable night if you fell across the gap.

Was it worth it? - Maybe... First, it is not easy to reach the hotel if you come by train (FR1). Possibly we got something wrong and it was our fault, but our way to the hotel was a real ordeal. It is located at one of the major busy streets and it seems the only reasonable way to reach it is by bus coming from Piazza Tiburtina, or by a hotel free shuttle, if you're lucky enough to run across it. The hotel itself is a Sowjet-type of building. It looks peculiar but acceptable, just only if you face its main entrance. From the back (to see it you have to venture a walk towards the former sport facilities, now an abandoned bush-ridden area behind it) it just looks like a run-down prison. The area it is in is a mixture of old office or warehouse buildings and some undefined green area, that might have once been nice, but now conveys a sense of downfall and a weird in-the-middle-of-nowhere spot. The hotels interior is surprisingly nice, so are the rooms: slightly outdated, but in some old Italian style. A remarkable plus of the hotel is the breakfast: a wide selection of food, incl. fruit, cakes etc. In total, this hotel might be a good choice, if you're in Rome by car or you do not mind long travel to the city center (apart from the distance, it's a matter of traffic jams!). If you plan a longer stay to see Rome and/or are after some romantic getaway, you might be better off looking for some other place.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBargain Price - But at a cost...\u201d", "Author": "Dan_t4", "ReviewID": "UR33125273", "Content": "My girlfriend and I booked a trip to Rome to mark our 2 year anniversary and decided to book our flights and hotel separately. I read some reviews before booking this Hotel and saw some of the nightmare stories from 2007 but saw that most recent ones seemed to be ok, and this coupled with the price (\u00a3187 for 5 nights!) appeared perfect. I will go through the up's and downs of this place step by step.. Location - This Hotel is miles away from Rome! There is a bus stop close to the Hotel, and the bus comes every 30 minutes(ish) and every hour on Sundays and this is about a 30 minute ride to the nearest metro which is Tiburtina FS which is still about a 20 minute Metro ride to the centre of Rome. It is too far away to return to after a day of sight seeing to then get changed and go out again, so we ended up staying out all day and returning late at night. Transport - DO NOT TAKE THE BUS AT NIGHT!! When returning to the hotel from the Metro station it is again a 30 minute ride, but it is more like a tour of some sort of sub-culture after about 9pm and i would not recommend this to anyone. A taxi from the station to the hotel costs around 15 Euro. Area - The Hotel boasts the fact it is 48 meters from a bus stop, but sadly at night there are a string of Hookers that are much much closer all along the Via Salaria. When night falls they all come out and stand near to the footbridge that you have to cross if you want to get a bus. Again after dark, a strange sort of food van appears in the car park next to the hotel where old men gather and talk very loudly into the night - possibly the pimps. Staff - The staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful and were very understanding when my girlfriend fell ill over some bad food we had eaten in the city. Always appeared smart and proffesional. Rooms - The rooms are basic and dated to say the least. They are not the most comfortable places on earth, but they are adequate. The TV is not worth turning on, and the telephone is straight out of the 80's. There is no literature in the room at all, so have your guide book with you if your looking for inspiration. Our room was at the front of the hotel and was extremely noisy at night due to the fact there was a main road right outside and constant Ambulance Sirens. The Train line runs across the road and they run until about 01.00 hours so be prepared to be woken up until then. As I said earlier, the food van and old men gather into the night and can be very noisy. Our room had AC but it was not particularly noticable and it was still very hot in our room at the end of the day. Cleaning - The rooms are serviced daily and are kept clean. For some reason our towels always smelt like Salt and Vinegar crisps?! which was very strange! The bathroom is dated and the shower in in the bath running off of the taps. Overall the standard of clenliness is good. Food - We did not eat at the hotel, but got the odd can of overpriced coke (as is everywhere in Rome). In Conclusion - This Hotel is seriously Budget. The area is awful after dark and it is at least an Hour away before you actually get to the bits of Rome you want to see. In my opinion, it would be well worth paying a little extra to stay somewhere more romantic and closer to the city and i wish i had! The Staff seem to make the best of what they have (which isn't much) and The Hotel is a place to sleep and not much else.

We observed other disconcerted tourists on a budget whispering outside the doors, but alas, the policy is strictly no refunds/no cancellations. Sitting outside the highway, its in a dismal industrial area with prostitutes on ever corner and absolutely nothing around- no restaurants, shops, grocery, etc, but a quick bus route into Rome, which is convenient. It was somewhat misadvertised, the website stating there is a lovely garden and good restaurant, as well as an airport shuttle (no shuttle). Our window opens onto an empty lot with junk strewn about. The rooms are awfully decorated. It is cheap, it's not too far outside of Rome but even spending as little time as possible in the hotel, in the end, the savings didn't make up for the depressing atmosphere of the place.

However we were pleasantly surprised. It was a reasonable price compared to city centre hotel prices, beware Brits, Rome is very expensive (more later) Getting there from the City Centre is easy, metro's every 2 or 3 minutes to Tiburtini which takes 10 minutes max, then a 20 minute bus ride, buses every 15 minutes. This did not bother us as I used to have a 40 minute bus ride every day to work so I noticed nothing different and after 3 days we were totally used to the travelling. I think they have cleaned up the area as there were no hookers and pickpockets whatsoever in evidence, again if you have been near certain parts of Tyneside, the outskirts of Rome are like the Cotswolds in comparison. so travelling to and from the hotel was nothing different to travelling in any city suburb and even better there is a shuttle bus from the hotel to the metro every day at various times.. The receptionists at the hotel were incredibly helpful, the barman a great bloke and drinks at the bar were half the price of drinks in Rome centre which saved us quite alot. The restaurant was quite good but we only went once as they did'nt do pizzas! but it was nice enough. There is also free wi fi and a free computer with internet access at the hotel which was ideal for keeping tabs on my ebay and emails and again saved us a packet not having to use internet cafes. Rooms were clean and fine for the job, breakfast was traditional Italian (basic) nice bread and butter but then lots of jam etc and sweet croisants, cereals but no cheese, ham, eggs etc. So there you are nowhere near as bad as it sounds, clean, cheap drinks and great value. Rome is fantastic no doubt about it but very expensive, 6 quid a pint, 5 quid a glass of wine in any bar whether scruffy backstreet or prime position in a piazza. Only good value food at night is pizza, pasta seem cheap but you don't get much as it is a prima platte (starter), ministrone soup 6 or 7 quid a bowl, bruschetta 3 quid, (a thin piece of toast with chopped tomato and a pinch of oregano on it) But at lunchtime there are loads of offers, best we found was El Borracho near Campo di Fiori, fochetta's or Pannini's with any filling plus a beer for 3 quid. Best pizzas we found were at 'Wanted' and ' Vechia Roma' both on Via Leonina in the Cavour area where there are loads of other places also at half reasonable prices. I'm on a roll now, book online for the Vatican museums or face a 2 hour queqe, go to the Forum first and get a combined ticket for the Forum and Collaseum otherwise a 2 hour queque at the Colluseum and if you still have a teacher union card or GTC card take it and you will get 3 euros off. Most arty places you have to pay for which is a bit of a culture shock for those of us used to free London Museums. Thats it, have fun.
