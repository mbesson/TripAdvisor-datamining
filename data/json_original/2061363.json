It's quite a distance from Hackney Central, but very well placed for Homerton overland rail station - just two minutes walk, and that will take you into central London. The bad points first: The decor is desperately in need of work. It's a listed building, and apparently it's difficultt o get permission to do anything with it - but think flaking woodchip walls, dreadful thin velvet-like flock carpets and very tatty fixtures. Some of the walls seem to be paper thin. You can hear noise through many of them, and the place seems absurdly hot as you mount the stairs. ok so that all sounds awful. However, I had two really good nights sleep. the building itself was an extremely elegant one in its dday, and the original georgian spiral stair case and some original features remain. My room was on the top floor (there is a lift) and was large if sparcely furnished. My bed, however, was comfortable, spotlessly clean and had a good, thick duvet. Bathrooms are shared, and somewhat remeniscent of 60s boarding houses, but there is at least a proper bath and the room was of excellent proportions. The service manager at reception (which is open 24 hours) is extremely friendly. He knows the limitation of the place, but it was only around \u00a335 a night and in london, that's extremely good value. Also, there is free wi fi. To conclude. If you're not bothered about luxury, and you don't mind the smell of cooking which inexplicably (as no one is cooking here) pervades the staircase as you mount, this is quite a find for its convenience and space. If they ever do it up properly, it would be really good, but then it would probably go up in price too.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201ccloser to hell than heaven!\u201d", "Author": "prospect45", "ReviewID": "UR125598312", "Content": "I chose this 'B&B' as it was convenient to a social event I was attending. I had booked in to a place called 'The Silkhouse' yet this name was nowhere to be found. The building is dingy and tired.

Now, I know it's cheap, and that's why I choose it. However, even when accommodation is cheap you expect a certain bare minimum standard. Here's a run down of my stay. Arrived in the reception area, which looked a bit run down and poorly kept, but, as I say, I was looking for somewhere cheap so this didn't bother me in the slightest. I was checked in by what I assume was a night porter, who was reasonably pleasant, and shown to my room. The room was horrible. For a start, the curtain rail was only attached to the wall on one side and so hung parallel to the window, with the curtains therefore, covering none of it. The view, however, was out over hackney and I was confident that no-one could see in, so I got over that quickly. Moreover, it was late at night and I was due to leave early the next morning so I didn't let it bother me. What really DID get to me happened next. I pulled back the quilt on the bed to find a filthy sheet. It was COVERED in these black marks. The bed looked like it had been slept in by a mechanic dressed in his work clothes! Disgusting. So I went downstairs and told the night porter this and he asked me to go wait in the room and someone would be up. About ten minutes or so later some guy in a tracksuit bottoms, t-shirt and flip-flops arrived up and asked me what the problem was. I invited him in, pulled back the quilts on both beds in the room and politely informed him that there was no way I could be expected to sleep in either bed. He grunted something incomprehensible and gestured that I should follow him, which I did. A few seconds later I was in another room (this time the curtains hung down in front of the window rather than beside it...they just didn't close fully), with sheets that weren't great either but would do. Then came the highlight of the stay! Rather than offer an apology or show a bit of humility, before leaving the room the guy turns and says, \"you know, the dirty sheets aren't our fault, that's how the launderette sends them to us\". By this stage, I was more than annoyed and so rather than engage him in an argument I just asked him to leave. The next morning, the place didn't get any better. I knew the rooms weren't en-suite, but this didn't bother me. I have no problem sharing a bathroom in a cheap hotel. However, the 'shower' in that bathroom was a hose out of the bath taps. The bath itself was on a bit of a raised platform meaning that you had to step up to get into it. This would have been fine if it wasn't for the fact the bathroom wall stopped a foot below the ceiling with the space between being filled by clear glass!!! I was showering away while looking out onto the corridor outside! OK, while I didn't have much to hide I can't imagine how females showered without feeling like one of those women in the notorious windows of Amsterdam. Seriously, avoid this place like one would Arthur Road Jail!!", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGround Floor Room (possibly #4)\u201d", "Author": "BathBuck", "ReviewID": "UR120398946", "Content": "About 400m from the nearest tube down a long terraced road, this hotel is more of a hostel for migrant workers and travelling students.

So we were stranded in London. After an hour and a half of waiting, they got us into another hotel 2 miles away (named the \"Sacred Heart Lodge Hotel\" which I think was its sister hotel, so therefore am writing this review in both City view Hotel and Sacred heart). To be fair, I was pretty angry when I turned up to the hotel (sacred heart) and the guy behind the desk was very understanding and assisted me in getting my bearings to where exactly I was. Even though he was very pleasant, he couldn't hide the fact that the hotel was extremely run down. You basically stay in a small grubby white room, with a bed and TV- and if your brave enough, spend awkward amount of time in the shared kitchen/living room space with random strange men, and then cross your fingers that you don't bump into any of them when you dash to the shared grotty bathroom, hoping that you don't accidentally touch anything \"infectious\". I would also say that the hotel smells awful, I know that sounds petty and stupid, but it was really off putting. There is no frills to this stay what so ever, but at least it was pretty quite(ish) \"Would I stay here again?\" my honest answer would be No. Just because this hotel is cheap doesn't mean its worth it, I would definately rather spend an extra \u00c2\u00a320 a night, on a bog standard hotel that a grotty cheap one, even if the stay was only for one night.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA fab place to stay for a work trip\u201d", "Author": "Beth G", "ReviewID": "UR117296722", "Content": "As a graduate student, taking my degree show down south was going to be costly so I needed to be careful with money for my accomadation. I found this place online and liked the price. I know London well so was happy with the area, but what I would advise is that whilst it is technically part of Hackney, it is in Homerton - there are a few takeaways and shops nearby but if you want supermarkets and nice bars you will need to get the bus/walk to Hackney proper. The hotel itself is excellent for the price. You have your own room, as I had a single (still with a double bed) I had to share a bathroom with one other room but that caused no issues. You get TV, free wifi, free brekkie and full 24 use of a kitchen which was great for me as a solo guest. The kitchen has an oven, hob, microwave - you can use it to cook anything. The staff really can't do enough to help you, they're lovely. On my final night I was invited to have supper with them, homemade curry. This hotel isn't star rated and if you want a holiday I wouldn't recommend it, but for any other purposes I can't say enough good stuff. It's about a 30 second walk to Homerton station (Overground) and the same to Wick Road and buses to central London. The rooms are basic but very clean, and best of all the staff (24 hours a day) are fantastic.

We were taken to our room and greeted with a blast of cold air as the windows were wide open, we had no promised en-suite bathroom, instead a damp, dirty communal bath and toilet and the wardrobe doors were all hanging off their hinges.
