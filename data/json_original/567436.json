The double room (with a sink in the corner, a desk, a tv and 3 chairs) was big, clean and tidy; it overlooked the backyard. We could hear noises from other rooms and the floor was creaking. Nevertheless, the night was quiet and peaceful (actually we were completely tired and devasted when we came back home!). The shared bathroom (one toilet and one shower) was ok: not stylish but always clean and available. In the morning we went downstairs for the breakfast. A typical continental breakfast (milk (only cold!), coffee, juice, bread, butter, jam, ham, cheese, tomatoes and so on....). We ate a lot! The staff was friendly (they didn't ask us anything for the parking ticket (in fact we needed it just for few hours....)). Price: 60\u20ac P.S.

Gasteiner Hof provides the wireless internet connection and that can be connected in my own room. that's great and easy to use my internet phone to make an internatinal call with low fares. amazingly comparing the experience of staying Gasteiner Hof 4 years ago, I found the surrounding area is more convenient to find more restaurants and supermarkets ( one of them is openning to 9:00pm ). that makes me easier to get food or other supplies. I was told by staff in Gasteiner Hof that there's a self service laundry store just 2 stations of Berlin U-Bahn away. that's good way to get my clothes clean. Staff is nice and willing to help.

It was the first city on a train journey through central Europe, when we also visited Prague, Vienna and Budapest. The hotel has directions on its website. We landed at Schoenfeld airport, to the southeast of Berlin. From there we took a 171 bus to Rudow U-bahn station (10 minutes) where underground Line 7 goes without change to Blissestrasse (30 minutes). The hotel lies in a side road 100 metres to the north of the station and, after one false start, we found it without undue difficulty. Our room (two floors above ground) was spacious, bright and clean. The shower / wc was cramped but adequate, with plenty of towels and hot water. The glazing was sufficient to eliminate street noise, though there was some audible sounds from other rooms. Though the mattresses were a little thin, the beds were comfortable and we slept well. The room was well maintained and supplied during our stay. There is no elevator and no nighttime reception. I was able to settle my bill with a debit card. The buffet breakfasts were on the generous side of adequate, with cereal, cold meats, cheese, eggs, bread, yogurt and fruit, with unlimited tea, coffee and toast. Getting to and from the buffet table can be awkward in the smallish breakfast room. The area is not oversupplied with quality restaurants, although we had a fair value meal at the nearby Badenscher Hof jazz club on a Friday night (it\u2019s beer rather than wine here, as the latter is wildly overpriced). Otherwise, you can risk a local Imbiss (Berlin fast food takeaway / restaurant) or go uptown. There is a very handy and good 24 hour supermarket nearby on Berliner Strasse. Getting around means using Berlin public transport: tube, bus and tram. The system is fairly intuitive, and a day ticket for the AB zone was a reasonable \u20ac6.10. Though German transport has a fine reputation, our final days were bedevilled with ticket machine issues, and service failures due to engineering works, demonstrations and mechanical breakdown; so allow sufficient time for your journey.", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "Troubadour", "ReviewID": "UR29762034", "Content": "Clean, simple rooms.

The room was clean with ample room for the four of us. The bedding was changed daily! A small modern shower was retrofitted in a small room off to the side in the room. The breakfasts were the usual continental style with a nice selection of meats, cheeses, yogurt, rolls, etc. The desk is staffed from 8am to 10pm and are always eager to assist.

Noticed on the first two nights that the walls were a bit thin between the rooms as we could hear the neighbours' TV in the middle of the night but it wasn't a big problem. On the third night, a large group of university students checked in and took up our entire floor. We got back to the hotel a bit after 10pm (which is when the reception desk closes) and when we entered our room we were gobsmacked by the noise from the next room. It seemed that all of the students were partying in the room next to ours. As the hours went by and no doubt more and more alcohol was consumed, the noise became worse. It sounded like they were jumping off furniture and tackling each other, banging into our wall, yelling and screaming like they were in a frenzy. They eventually went out at around 3am and came back at around 5am. When we checked out the following morning we complained about the noise and said we didn't think we should have to pay for that night (or at least not the full amount). The person on the desk disagreed and said we will have to pay the full amount as it is their policy and they're not responsible for the behaviour of their guests. So we received no compensation for our night of hell in this hotel. Aside from this incident the hotel itself is OK, location is fine, food is OK but their lack of concern regarding our complaint was disgusting.
