After three tube rides from Central London to get the the hotel I was on my way back home within ten minutes of arriving. After getting lost upon leaving the tube station and finding myself in a near ghetto (lugging several hundred pounds worth of video equipment behind me) and fearing for my life, I eventually found the hotel which, on the outside didn't appear too bad, neither did the reception area; pretty much what I'd expected for \u00a340 per night in London. But what awaited me on the floors above had to be seen to be believed! The room (which wasn't en suite) consisted of a bed (which admittedly, looked clean and was made up), a wardrobe which looked like it had been retrieved from a tip and painted white, badly; a bedside cabinet, again looking like a rescue job with a top covered in cup rings and cigarette burns; a filthy dirty, threadbare carpet, a kettle that was filthy and, had I had any desire to use it would have to have sat it on the floor as the only available electrical socket was on the other side of the room from the 'hospitality tray'; a hand basin that had certainly not been cleaned for several weeks if not months; and to top it all, a stain on the wall near the hand basin that, on closer inspection, appeared to be a lump of dried vomit! The bedroom window didn't need a net curtain as privacy was assured by way of the thick film of dirt. Against my better judgement I decided to check out the shared bathroom. Words cannot describe what confonted me. The whole bath was filthy dirty and the rim was covered in limescale that had gone way beyond the 'brown' stage. This was black and thick with mildew. The toilet handn't seen even a dash of Harpic for years, probably. Oddly, the door had several holes punched in it, presumably from people trying to get out!

Ok then, what are the good points...there must be some good points... The location is excellent for easy access into central London and having a tube stop only a minutes walk away is great. The parking is ample and although not technically secure, feels safe to leave your car parked up. Mid-week, we`ve never had any noise issues except for the main road and straining heating system. Last time I managed to leave an expensive piece of equipment in the room, the staff recovered and looked after this until I was able to pass by and collect.

We booked this hotel because it is within reasonable walking distance to the ground. The reception area was quite cosy looking but the higher you climb the stairs the worse it got. When I entered our double bedroom [2nd floor No 409] I had to have a good laugh. I have seen better youth hostels. The decoration is about 20 years old, with some of the wall paper hanging off the wall. There are mysterious stains everywhere. The carpet is filthy and the curtains have burn holes as well as being dark brown from smoke and dirt. No double glazing along a busy road. The rooms furniture is even better. The wardrobe is a cut and shut job assembled and painted from another old wardrobe, the chairs legs were so bend that if you sat on it you'd slowly approach the ground backwards. There is a TV with an areal and here comes the biggest joke, they have a kettle and the usual instant coffe etc but when you want to boil some water you soon notice that the only free plug hole is underneath the little vanity table, so you have to put the kettle underneath on the floor to do this... The bed linen were fresh but not the cover, which was crap because we were cold without it. The heating can't be regulated from your room, you come in and its cold but they leave it on through the night and we had to open the window in order not to suffocate. Bathroom is small, functional but disgusting. Not because of dirt [it wasn't dirty] but covers are missing along the base of the shower, the filling along the basin is old, dirty and brittle. During the night you can hear other peoples TVs blearing and you get the impression that some people actually live there through the DSS. Noisy, dirty, ugly, too cold/warm, too expensive for what it is. Won't go there again even if the staff might be friendly. I mean come on, how much does it cost to replace a curtain?
