I was going to try Priceline just before the wedding but a friend ended up booking at the same place so I kept the reservation. I booked a single room but think I ended up with a double since my bed could have fit two reasonably sized people. My traveling companion ended up with a room on the ground level, I got room 10 which is up three flights of stairs, there is no elevator so if you are unable to climb stairs with your luggage I would contact the hotel before you book and make sure you can get a room on the ground floor. There were even more rooms higher than mine and there is no lift. There was a bit of noise from the street and you could hear the trains from Paddington on the ground floor.

In addition to easy tube access, it is only 1 block from the Big Bus tour drop-off (although the desk staff didn't know that when we asked). Room was small, but adequate. It is an old Victorian building, so stairs are steep and narrow. We had read about that and requested a room on the lowest floor, which we got (remember that the first floor is one floor up). Not too much space in room, but OK. However, because of uneven floor, the bed rolled when I sat down. The bathroom is definitely as others have described, although it reminded me of a bathroom on an airplane. No bigger, except for a small extension for a shower. In the shower, the handheld shower head holder was so high and faced the wall, so that you could only use the shower as handheld. Also, there was a big step up to get into the bathroom cubicle (it is all prefab), so you need to remember not to stub your toes at night. Also, there is only one towel per person provided. So hair and body were dried with the same towel. They did change the towels each day. Also one bar of soap to share between sink and shower (but you could reach the sink from the shower...). We had no problem with any noise. The breakfast was fine, although it would be very repetitive after more than a couple of mornings. There is a very good fish & chips house down the block called Sussex House. When we went to check out, however, we ran into a very strange charge. They wanted 5 British pounds per bag (including backpacks) to hold the luggage after 2 p.m. That's about $8 U.S. per bag. Our flight wasn't leaving until 8 p.m., and we intended to leave the the luggage until about 4 p.m. But the clerk was not going to give us any leeway. He said it was clearly stated in their policy. I reread the web site for the hotel and saw nothing. My husband finally got him to agree to 10 pounds (about $17.50), but this left us with a very bad taste. And the clerk complained that we left 4 bags (including the backpacks). We have traveled all over the world and have never had anyone charge us for holding luggage. Granted, they don't have a lot of space, and the luggage was stored in the corner of the hotel lounge (so you weren't even paying for security).

The door to the kitchen was open from the dining room and I could clearly see that it was clean. There was a heating radiator in the rooom, but no air conditioning so cooling was by means of opening the window. This could be a problem in the height of summer with heat and noise but i was there in October so it was fine. Hairdrier, flat screen tv, telephone, tea and coffee making facilities, all good. I would normally stay at some no-frills chain like travel lodge because at least I know what I am getting. What I got here was comparable. The rooms are small, and the bathroom really struggles to even call itself a room. In fact the bathroom is a tiny, plastic, pre-fab cabin that I suspect has been retro-fitted into the corner of the room in order to call it en suite. Seriously, its so small you could sit on the toilet and take a shower at the same time (not that I was so inclined). This hotel is fine. It's functional. I wouldnt stay for any length of time unless I had received a really really great rate, but for a short business trip where all i needed was somewhere safe to sleep, i couldnt complain at all.

There is also cereal (and milk), toast, butter, many jams, tea, coffee etc. The only thing that could have made the breakfast better was possibly some cheese or ham with the toast... The only bad thing about the hotel were the stairs, we were on the3rd floor. The final flight of stairs were quite steep. Not a problem for youths, but a troublesome feature for more mature people... The room also had some cracks in the walls and ceiling, but it is a 2* hotel after-all, so what would you expect? The room (Quad) was a decent size, and so was the bathroom... The bed-spreads, towels, etc were always clean, and there was also a kettle, mugs, milk, sugar, etc for making tea and coffee. The receptionist didn't speak much English, but did help the best he could when we needed... He is just a receptionist after all, not someone you sit down to have a chat with over a cup of tea. So that wasn't really a problem. Another thing which is a bit inconvenient but very safe at the same time is the fact that the door is always closed, so you'll ring the bell and he'll buzz you through... The hotel was literally 6 meters away from incoming buses, and only a corner away from outgoing buses. Paddington station is also a short walk away, and connects the most useful lines into London. The location is excellent, very safe at night since the area the hotel is in (Norfolk Square) is filled only with hotels and restaurants. The park is also very quite and relaxing after a long day sightseeing. There is also a close supermarket (Sainsbury's) in paddington railway station.

Even in sunny days, during the day the room was very dark. The room was very small, even too small. You should use the room only for sleeping but don't forget to take your ear plugs with you because you will have to listen to the noise of the trains all the time. I suggest you to take your towel with you as the one they give you smells like seasoned chips. The TV in the room has only 3-4 channels so if you will spend some time in the room don't forget to bring your laptop with you. The shower is too small, and the location of tap was wrong, you can easily touch the tap and boil yourself. The carpet was very dusty I am sure, and there were lots of mites in the room, possibly everywhere, I know because I am allergic to them and I kept sneezing whenever I was in the room, and not sneezing when I wasn't.
