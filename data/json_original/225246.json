The front desk service is poor. We only had 2 towels in our room for 3 people, when I asked for more, I was told that they did not know where the clean towels were. I called again and was told that I could come down to get them. Also, there was no dinner available at the property and the suggestions listed were either closed or permanently gone. We went back to the front desk to ask for help and they could not tell us where to eat???? We ended up using our GPS and found a great place, Donna's.

I chose the Mt.

While only a touch on the \"no frills\" side (the furniture and bathroom are little institutional), it's a great value, clean, and convenient. Nice balcony/patio. Very close to 83 and Falls Rd. Nice breakfast (plus sodas and a selection of Tazo teas, granola bars, etc.). No restaurant or bar, but it's not a bad drive to anything in Baltimore or Towson.

The grounds are a beautiful, tranquil scene to take in, between meetings. The food was commented on as \"ridiculously good!\" From the time our patrons arrived, they were asked by all hotel staff if they needed anything, and to let them know if they could serve them in any way.

The area is really beautiful, the facilities themselves (i.e. the conference rooms) are clean and well-appointed, the staff was great, and the food was excellent. I loved that they kept us well-supplied with delicious meals, snacks, drinks and caffeine throughout! The hotel left something to be desired. The staff was really nice and friendly and the rooms are clean, but they are very dorm-like in a lot of ways.

This is actually owned by Johns Hopkins University. I have learned to read through the lines on tripadvisor reviews and have learned which ones to ignore. I will certainly be staying here again. First of all I do agree that although very clean, the rooms are a cross between a large dorm or a hospital room. But so what. The beds were as new and comfortable as in any top hotel. Everything worked and everything needed was supplied. The bathroom had \"green\" natural soaps and shampoos and I actually found them much softer on the skin and hair than some of those top products in 5 star hotels. Each room has a small balcony with chairs and it was nice to sit out there and read in the sun. Breakfast was a cold buffet that included bagels, cereals, pastries, yogurts, juices, hardboiled eggs, coffee, tea, bottled waters, sodas. Certainly enough to make an adequate breakfast. The attendant was so nice that even though it was past the time for breakfast and she was trying to clean up, she kept responding to requests for more items for a good extra hour. Also the front desk staff was very helpful, polite and responsive at all times. There is a very large work out room that you have access to. It is similiar to what you would have in a small health club. There is also a very nice lounge area with a pool table and large TV. I spent time walking around inside the buldings. It is so large that I was lost but I found so many beautiful areas, marble staircases, outside dining decks, fountains, meeting rooms, cafeterias, etc. Also the grounds are wooded with paths to walk.
