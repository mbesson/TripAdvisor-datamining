Maybe we just a bad room but our bathroom looked like a public bathroom and was the size of a linen closet. The 'double' bed was two single beds pushed together but what bothered me most about the beds was there were living creatures inside of it. I woke up with at least a dozen bites on the side of my face that I slept on and a few more scattered on my limbs. I told the conceirge about this, and he tried to convince my that maybe it was a food allergy.

All the stories about bed bugs and bad service in Venice made us look elsewhere, which finally brought us booking 2 double rooms in Alla Bainca in Mestre. First experience in wasn't very enjoyable: we arrived to bus station in Mestre and got completely lost. It was raining and GPS on my phone was not working at all, so we had no idea where we were and wondered around for 40 minutes. Luckily we met a local, who not only directed us, but... also gave us a free ride to Alla Bianca! So much for the stories of absent italian hospitality! Of course, later we realized how easy it was to get to this hotel from the bus station- walking for 7 minutes down the street or taking a bus. The hotel, as expected, was not 5 star experience. Everything is small, there is no elevator (so you have to drag your luggage up the narrow stairs (not a problem for me)), furniture is old, there is no view from the room, the conditioner in our room was leaking a bit (I think something was wrong with condensate system)(well, we didn't need it anyway), there were no english channels on TV (not an issue for me at all), TV itself was smallest I've ever seen, room had a odor of chlorine (I think) and the breakfast was 5 eur extra (reasonable, I believe) ... In the other hand, we payed 35 euros per person (per night), the staff was extremely helpful and nice, bus stop was just across the street, beds were comfy and clean, the area was very quite (even though, as a guy who gave us a ride told us, there are prostitutes and drug dealers in the area at night. We haven't seen or heard anything, though), there was a nice little safe under the window in our room and you can get an amazing cappuccino for only 80 cents in the breakfast area (other drinks are also available around the clock), you can purchase a bus ticket right at reception (they will also give you detailed leaflet on buses) ... This hotel is very basic, don't expect much. Nevertheless, low prices, location and friendly staff makes it outstanding place to stay.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cA competent budget hotel for those looking to save a bit visiting Venice.\u201d", "Author": "Reeler_Canada", "ReviewID": "UR33204678", "Content": "Following the advice of frugal friends, we chose to stay outside of Venice proper while visiting the international contemporary art Biennale. We hoped the Alla Bianca would fit the bill in terms of a basic, clean place to collapse at the end of the day, and for the most part it didn't disappoint. Small issues did arise here and there - we booked a double-bed room well in advance of arriving and got two twins pushed together instead, with a vague promise of another room coming available that never materialized. Inside the hotel was fine and clean, with the lobby and the bathrooms being the core focus of recent renovations. Our minibar fridge was non-functional, and there were some definite noise issues with cleaning staff starting early in the morning. The beds were acceptably comfortable, the bathroom was small but immaculate. Wireless was available, but as in many places during our travel it was excessively expensive. The day manager was very kind and helpful. We hadn't had a chance to pick up an international power adapter and wanted one while in Venice to charge a camera; he set us up nicely with clear directions to a nearby store. The Alla Bianca is a short walk from a suburban bus line that takes you into Venice (eventually) each day. It was typically packed and off-schedule, but I suppose that's a side effect of saving money by staying in Mestre. On a side note, the desk staff was quick to recommend the purchase of a multi-day bus pass that made travel to and from the hotel (and on all water buses) easy, although you should be aware that the bus in question (the Padova) doesn't seem to be included in the pass' service area (our passes worked fine throughout Venice, but beeped in error when we tried them several times on the bus home), so we wound up having to be discreet freeloaders for each trip - despite having paid thirty-odd euros for a 72-hour pass. Finally, strolling on the busy road near the hotel that the bus runs on at night might not give you an especially romantic notion of Venice - unless you happen to pay for your romance by the hour. Overall, if you are looking for someplace cheap to stay near Venice, and are tolerant of some of the side effects of saving money, then the Alla Bianca is a good value.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Alla Bianca Hotel Trattoria Bar", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d1177171-Reviews-Alla_Bianca_Hotel_Trattoria_Bar-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$66 - $145*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">&quot;Via Cantore, 23&quot;</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30175</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1177171", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/72/22/72228dd38426160b1cc3f615dec233804large.jpg"}}
