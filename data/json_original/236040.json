They were right. The rooms are small as a boat cabin would be, but clean, comfortable and equiped with telephone, cable TV, heater and private bathroom ( those are really small but once again, private!) . What else could I expect from a hotel that charges around 85 Euros in Amsterdam where you could easily pay over 200 for a 3 star night? The experience of staying at a Boat is nice. Although It is fixed on an old port, you can feel a very soft move of the water. Nothing to worry about. The location isn`t the best but pretty easy to access. From behind the Centraal Station you can take a ferry ( for free ) to cross the IJ River and drop off just beside the Botel. The ferry runs until midnight. After that, a van service runs to and from the hotel to another spot ( the van is free too ). So, instead of taking the ferry to the Botel, you take another one just to cross the the river and the van will stop by all night long in very short periods... very simple! I got breakfast Included booking at booking.com. Although there are sime types of bread, scramble eggs, ham, cheese, Oranje juice, coffee and tea, i wouldn`t pay 10 Euros for each person. So, let`s say that it`s a very good continental breakfast but not good enough for 10 Euros. Smoking is not allowed in the hotel but to smell marijuana in the aisle was not something difficult. Well It`s Amsterdam and here it`s allowed, but not inside the hotel. Still, some guests seem not to care. I have to say that I saw one guest being reprimended by and employee. Overall It was a great stay. Come if you don`t care spending some time ( not much ) between downtown and your hotel, if you look for a cheap but comfortable and secure place to stay.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe thin walls ruined it for us :(\u201d", "Author": "Myakhin", "ReviewID": "UR128101956", "Content": "We stayed at the Botel for three nights and found it to be perfectly adequate as far as the accommodation is concerned.

A couple of the reception staff were very curt (both female) but the remainder were friendly and helpful.

We did speak to reception at 1am on the second night and they did ask the people to be quiet which helped. This is not a fault of the Botel but must be taken into consideration as I'm sure we are not the first or last to experience this.

Firstly and to clear the air - I've been reading reviews about the Botel on Trip Advisor and I am amazed that people go here if there expecting the Ritz? The Botel is a cheap alternative, offering a decent standard of bed and breakfast. As stated, The rooms are not massive. We stayed in room 217 which is located on the reception level, facing the NDSM Werf Pier and Amsterdam skyline...............The Best Side! Our room consistered of a queen size bed, a small coloured tv, radio alarm clock, wardrobe and drawer space. And a small toilet, shower and sink. Please note that all of the before mentioned are cleaned daily, towels and small collection of toiletries and if you require extra items, pillows etc then just ask. Alarm calls from reception are also bookable. If your flight is a early departure, you can also pre book the shuttle bus to take you to the 24 hour ferry, situated directly opposite Central Station. Getting to the Botel couldn't be easier. From the airport, catch a train to Amsterdam Central. Once there, walk to the rear of the station, cross over the road and turn left. Next, you need to get on a boat. Head to Pier 1 (Far End), you'll see NDSM WERF. The boat is free and runs every 30 minutes. The boat does not stop and delivers you directly next to the Botel. \"What's Easier!\" Boat timetable for LAST boat only - Fri / Sat - 00.45hrs Sun / Mon - 23.45hrs. Don't worry if you miss the last boat, catch the ferry to Buiksloterweg - runs every 10 minutes, 24 hours a day. Once over the other side, wait infront of the building directly opposite the landing stage. The Botel shuttle bus will turn up. It's free! Great Tip! We purchased all our evening meals using Group On Vouchers. I saved a small fortune. We had Thai, Turkish BBQ all-you-can-eat and Indian. I reckon we saved approx \u00c2\u00a375 GBP on the 3 meals Group On is free to subscribe, just go to there Dutch site and use Google Translate............Easy! If anyone requires any help with any of the above, please send a message and I will try and answer. Have a great time, We did! Weather was fantasic for March, sunny ever day.

The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was very shabby and dated and the TV was a portable - hey small to match the rest of it.

Prior to going, we had read reviews about how it had moved from its original location near Centraal Station. However, at the rear of the Station there is a small dock area with about 6 ferrys which take you back and forth various locations on the river free of charge. The ferry between Centraal Station and the Botel is marked 'NDSM' and takes exactly 10mins (we timed it). The ferry service is part of Amsterdams unbelievably efficent public transport system and this one runs from 7am with the last one leaving Centraal Station back to the Botel at 11:45pm. If you are heading back abit later, there is an all night ferry that goes directly across the river to another ferry port, and the Botel provide a free bus shuttle service to pick you up and take you back. The Botel itself is a little dated and basic, but so are most 2/3 star hotels in Amsterdam. The rooms were pretty small and basic, but fine if you intend on only using it as a 'base camp'. We found the bed very comfortable. The breakfast was basic continental, and there's not much to do 'on board'. There is a small bar with a TV, pool table, darts, PC - but again, fine if you intend on using it as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbase camp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The staff were really friendly, and always happy to chat and offer their help and opinions. We didn't experience any problems with the Botel or room, but as you are on a boat there is some slight 'swayage'! This was minimal but there were a few occassions when we would be eating in a restuarant \u00e2\u20ac\u02dconshore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and felt a slight 'rocking' feeling, but we found it quite funny! I have visited Amsterdam before with friends and stayed just off Dam Square. In my opinion the Botel is great for couples of all ages or familys who want something abit different. However, if you are on a boys/girls trip and intend on getting wasted non stop, you may find the novelty wears off pretty quick and travelling back and forth becomes a hindrance. Then again, we did find that heading back on the ferry at night helped sober us up, whether we had been in a bar or coffeeshop! We have told friends and family about it and everyone agrees its a really cool idea and sounds like fun. We thoroughly enjoyed our time on the Amstel Botel and it made our few days there very memorable. The bottom line is, this is a fun, novelty place to stay which is close to the city centre. There is so much to do and see in the city that all you really need is a place to leave your luggaage and sleep at night.

The bathroom is hardly a room at all. Quite literally just enough to fit a toilet, and a standing shower compartment. The room was not cleaned properly during room service. Bedsheets were never changed. Stars: * Service: Very good service. The staff at reception was friendly, pleasant and helpful. But apart from this, the hotel seemed to have no services at all. It's very basic, but okay. Stars: ** Breakfast Room: The botel has no restaurant, only a small bar and a breakfast room. Consistent with the rest of the interior of the boat, the room was very worn out. The breakfast buffet was much too small for the amount of people it served. The food was not very fresh - it seemed to have been out there for quite a while. Not a very wide choice of food available. The coffee was honestly the worst coffee I've ever drunk in my life.

If you want to have a disco in the shower with guests then I'd say get a bigger more expensive hotel with a bigger shower. Thankfully I didn't go to Amsterdam for the shower. It's quiet and scenic, with some very nice bars right on your door step. The benefit of staying here is that is that you can be relaxing at the hotel one minute and in no time you are right in the city centre.

The staff in the hotel were all bi-lingual, very friendly, up for a laugh and very helpful. The views of the canal were brilliant. To wake up on a morning and look out to nothing but water for miles was amazing. The Botel is situated a short distance from Dam centre, it can be accessed via a (free) small ferry boat, at first this can be daunting but after a couple of journeys it becomes fun. It takes about 10 mins and drops you directly at central station. There was only one problem with this, the boat stops at midnight. Therefore getting back to hotel at 12 was a bit of a farse. You have to get a (free) boat to a different port and then a (free) shuttle bus picks you up on demand and takes you back to the hotel. Its definately worth getting a taxi from the centre back to the hotel in the wee hours on the morn if you are impatient like me. It costs arounf 25 Euros though. This is the only downfall to the Botel, but in the same sense, this hinderence is also a blessing as staying in the centre of Dam can be really intense. It's nice to retreat away from the hustle and bustle at times, and the Botel offers that in abundance. The bedrooms are basic, but what more do you want for the cheap prices.

The staff were helpful, and there's a room for storing your luggage- should you arrive earlier than check-in or are flying out later than check out time. You now have to get a ferry over to the Botel (really easy to find at the back entrance of Central Station, last landing dock on the left as you walk out), the service is regular (every half hour I think), and takes only ten minutes.

When we got to the rooms, I almost checked out.....it was that bad, but I was too tired to go find another place to stay. Could not fit on the toilet without moving sideways. If you fell down in the shower, you would land in the toilet or sink. Literally, the bathroom is smaller than a closet. No A/C, just a small window to slide open for fresh air. No inside ventilation to speak of. Prisoners at Guantanamo have better conditions. The bar was a joke and the on site restaurant had terrible food. The cafe at the end of the pier was extremely expensive. This should be called the Prison Barge Hotel.

We had to get onto the Ferry and go to Central Station to buy a few bits and pieces. The ferry crossing was a little tedious as we always seemed to have just missed a ferry so had to wait 20 or 30 minutes for the next one. However, the weather was beautiful so not a problem waiting in the sunshine, but I would think it would be a different story in mid Winter!

The Fab Botel\u201d", "Author": "fortyboohoo", "ReviewID": "UR29303835", "Content": "I think this is the most difficult review I have ever compiled since this Hotel should be getting a rotten review for its tiny rooms, inconvenient location, poor decor, cheap furniture, and chipboard bed... But you know what... I loved it!!! Why? Well it was cheap... it advertised a rate of 80 euros/night, which is cheap for a continental capital city, but we got it for half that, a real cheap price... but more than that, much more... It had real character. Firstly... the tiny rooms... well this is a \"hotel\" which is in fact a boat... hence Botel. Stretched over several floors the rooms are not what one would call full height, make no mistake a 6 footer won't crash their head, but a little headroom saved on every floor no doubt allowed an extra floor of accommodation, so not only is the square footage small, but so is the CUBIC footage! Then there's the showeroom, this is definitely NOT a place to bring your cat, but the hot water from the shower had surprising quantity, pressure and heat... No it wasn't a power shower, but there's no denying it was a surprisingly good shower. The TV was an old fashioned portable, with a huge array of channels including a free streaming (or should that be \"screaming\"?) porn channel 24 hours a day (no parental control though so beware the kiddies). For those of you interested, and me and my partner certainly were as we'd come to enjoy Amsterdams famous cultural contribution to pleasures of the flesh, you'll find it at channel 24! The furniture was cheap, the bedlinen similar and the bedframe constructed from chipboard... yep every expense has been spared here... Although the mattress was in good condition and hence comfortable. The window was tiny, but then so was the room. The decor was tatty, the carpet repaired in one place with \"duck tape\" and frayed elsewhere. The whole place was clearly in decline... But... but... the Botel gently swayed, the view was of the harbour and the bed was a full sized double and comfortable... There was something distinctly likeable about this place. It could be its dreadful location... in an industrial, seemingly defunct part of Amsterdams port... yet, right next door to the Greenpeace ship, all decked out in its rainbow colours, opposite is an old soviet submarine, behind is an excellent and reasonably priced restaurant, \"The Kantine\"... And then there's the journey to and from the Botel, by free ferry running every 30 mins (From the Botel at on the hour and half hour, and from Centraal station on every quarter past and quarter to the hour). Easy peasy, a bracing 10 minute run across the harbour, a fantastic start and end to your sightseeing trips. In fact we experimented with a different ferry from The Botel and ended up at Amsterdams market, which is I hasten to add, huge and diverse, a wonderful experience of Dutch life. TO GET TO THE BOTEL from Centraal station... DO NOT USE A TAXI use the FREE FERRY... to reach it from Centraal station just exit the station following the ferry signs, once outside walk straight in front of you and cross the road... you'll now be at the waterfront, turn left and walk until you get to the ferries, you need the NDSM Werf, which is the last one of them. You'll see a sign above displaying the number of minutes to the next departure... in our experience the ferries ran dead on time throughtout the day. Note the ferry to NDSM Werf is not a 24 hour service and if you're after midnight you'll need to get a different ferry and then catch a free shuttlebus, so if you're planning a late night just speak to the staff at the Botel and they'll guide you. Amsterdam itself is less than 1 hour flight from Birmingham and the trains from the airport to Amsterdam Centraal are easily accessible and CHEAP. From Birmingham it takes me longer, and costs more to fly to my mates in Edinburgh than to the Botel, yet Amsterdam is such a world away from the UK!! Laughably, the Botel ( you may note I do note refer to it as a hotel... it would be a travesty to do so!) has 3 stars... Gawd knows which travel organisation awarded those... but there must be some trade description thing going on there. Even so, I really liked the place, it was a great place to put your head down, the ferry was a lovely way to start each day sightseeing. The Kantine was fab, and I will be returning, indeed we're already planning our next weekend in Amsterdam and we'll definitely be staying at the Botel!", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cSo-so hotel but the new location is awful\u201d", "Author": "English_Frankie", "ReviewID": "UR28141814", "Content": "My boyfriend and I had previously stayed at Botel two years ago, when it was only a 5 minute walk from Centraal Station.

This was really disappointing as the thing we liked most about it last time was its central location. The ferries only go every half an hour and you do waste time, what with waiting for a ferry and then spending 15 minutes on it to get to the hotel. We did have a car but none of the three people at the hotel that we asked had the faintest idea how to drive there from Amsterdam, which I thought was odd. The rooms are so-so. I noticed a few marks that looked like chocolate but could have been anything on the headboard of the bed. The bathroom is tiny and a bit like a pod. I am sure that the cups in the bathroom had already been used. On the plus side, the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!

You will get fleeced by a very honest driver, who will drive the correct route and charge you the proper metered fare. OR, he could have told you to go out the back of the train station, get the free 10 minute, and thoroughly enjoyable, ferry ride direct to the hotel. You also get to pass an old Russian submarine on the ferry which was a surprise. Once the very nice taxi driver dropped us off at the hotel, we boarded the hotel. Boarded being the right word. Its an old converted ferry and it was very novel. the staff were magnificient and, much to my relief, spoke very good English. They told us all about the ferry, chuckled as I swore the taxi driver up and down and checked us in quickly and efficiently. We checked out the room and were quite surprised. The bed was a comfortable bed, the room was clean, the tv was free, had a kettle and all the makings for a brew. The only complaint about the room was the bathroom. the toilet was fine, clean etc, but it was more of a \"head\" in the naval sense than a bathroom. It was incredibly tiny. If you are a porker, watch out for that. The shower itself is also tiny, but suitable for one person and seemed to have an unending supply of hot water. Trust me, the woman tested that with the longest shower in history. Our more rotunf bretheren should probably avoid the bathroom. Either way, if you drop the soap, skinny or not, its an adventure to retrieve it. Towels were replaced daily by the cleaning staff who also gave the room a spruce, made the bed, emptied the bins etc etc. Dunno about the bedlinen change routine as were only there for 3 nights. Half a mile away from the town (via the ferry, which is free and half-hourly) its a cracking base to your holiday/break. The hotel itself it very quiet, even though we saw at least 3 stag parties when there we were undisturbed. Contrary to the literature we had read, it wasnt a solid base under the boat. It had been moved and was afloat, which turned out to be a bonus. The gentle lapping of the water as you drifted off and woke was lovely, as was the soothing rocking. Not enough to make you queasy, just a gentle rock. The restaurant itself was clean, and the food was varied. Along the lines of a mixed continental buffet. Usual cereals, variety of bread rolls/croissants, cooked breakfast and toast. As it was a buffet, those with no restraint had a field day. Yanks can sure pack it away. Yeee-ha. As we were there to check out the city rather than loiter around a hotel, cant say too much about facilities. The staff were more than happy to point out places to go and things to see, and couldnt give you enough of their time. No parking, but with the trams etc, no need for your own transport. For the price we paid, we expected a hovel but got a diamond. Rambled enough, just keep it in mind.

The bathroom is comically small, but everything worked. It's all getting a little old, so expect marks and maybe some rust, but it was clean and the shower was powerful enough to wake me up! Location: the daytime ferry (until about 1am, depending on the day) goes from behind Centraal Station. The four little piers have a display board. If the display board has a number, that's how many minutes until the ferry. The daytime one is for NDSM Werf. It's free, easy and take between 7 and 10 minutes. I loved it. It takes you to the terminal 80 metres from the Botel. It runs every half an hour, and during rush-hour it's every 15 minutes. The evening ferry (runs all night, every 10 minutes) simply crosses the river, where a blue minibus takes you the 4-5 minutes to the Botel. It's all free, it works superbly and it means Centraal Station convenience. Our friends stayed in town and we were in town with them every morning with no effort. What does it matter where the boat is? To us, it didn't. It's in an industrial area (you can see it from Centraal Station ferry pier) next to a submarine. Service: The reception were helpful, if a little curt. We had no problems whatsoever. The exchange rate was the only sting in the tail! Other info: The windows get a little condensated, the boat sometimes rocks a tiny bit and the walls are thin (we heard next door have a marathon loving session!!). The TV has free movies and adult channels (so we were told...). There was a safe in the room. You can have as many door keys as you like. Some rooms smell a little smoky (ours didn't).

I saw nothing to merit the advert on the side of the boat which said \"luxury rooms from \u00e2\u201a\u00ac84\". There weren't even any tea or coffee making facilities. The Botel has moved from its original position and is now a 10-minute ferry ride up the river, so less than convenient for the night life. On the plus side, the ferries were free and run frequently. On the down side, if you miss one, it can be half an hour before the next one so you really need to plan your trip out. It's also not very convenient if you want to go back to get changed or if you forget to take something with you. I must admit that I'd been told it had moved but it wasn't clear exactly where it had moved to. Google Maps still show it in its original position. Considering I booked in January and paid \u00c2\u00a3200 for two nights, I came away feeling ripped off. I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel. I wouldn't go again.

The Botel is easy to get to from the airport. On arrival at Schipol airport the train station is well signed and situated within the same building. You need the train to Centraal Station which cost 8.60 euros for two adults. Once you get to central station follow the ferry signs to the Nord(North)of the building. On exiting the Station the stand for the ferry is across the road and on the left nearest the bike racks. The destination board your looking for is signed (NDSM-WERF). This ferry takes ten minutes to cross to the botel and runs every fifteen minutes,until 7.45pm. Then every 30 minutes after. The Botel supplies boat timetables at reception. We were in room 341 which had a waterside/submarine view which was lovely. Our room was very basic,but clean and compact. The room had a small bathroom with sink and shower. Im of a small build but the shower was quite interesting,especially when the boat was moving!(Still moored) It was a tight fit but got you clean. The shower also had a shower gel/shampoo and conditioner dispenser on the wall. The room has a small wardrobe with few hangers and spare blankets in,there is also a radiator which keeps it nice and warm. There is no tea making facilities. Hairdryers can be rented at reception for a ten euro deposit,which you get back on return. The beds were comfortable but noisy especially when you moved in them. There was only two pillows and when we requested more,we did not get them. The towels were replaced every day when the rooms are cleaned. There is a TV with a few English channels including BBC1 and 2. People with children be careful about channel 31 (Adult channel)! The Botel has a bar area which serves hot and cold drinks also a small selection of snacks which consist of toasted sandwiches and burgers. The bar opens until 1am. The breakfast area was large and fully equipped with a constant supply of continental and english breakfast selection. In Summary the Botel was clean basic and a comfortable stay. The only problem we encountered is that you are quite secluded when you get back to the Botel in the evening. If you have'nt eaten in the main town before you come back to the Botel you are limited for options to eat. There is either a burger at the bar area on the Botel or eat at the Kantine restaraunt next door which is expensive and the service was extremely slow. We paid 75 euros for a two course meal for two including drinks. The menu hasn't much of a choice and I am not sure if they have a childrens menu. There were no children in the restaraunt when we ate in there. The food was nice when it finally arrived! But not worth the cost. Be aware: When we got to the train station to buy the tickets back to the airport, all the automatic ticket machines would not accept cash or credit cards. So we had to go and queue at the ticket office. Here you are given a ticket and wait for your number to be called. (Bit like argos) If you are running late this would hold you up as it gets busy. This may of been a problem with the ticket machines that day,but in case it wasn't it may be easier to buy your return tickets at the airport on arrival to save time.

My husband is a wheelchair user and we were a bit disappointed that there are two steps to get onto the pavement on the pier it is located but we managed to get him punted up. There is a ramp but he did need a hand to wheel up it because of the carpet that lines it. The life was fine but the room a bit small and his chair could only just make it into the room and was held captive by the door. There is a little step into the toilet which again is small but suited the husbands limited mobility perfectly. To be honest I had more trouble with the little step than him after a few glasses of wine. Must say on that note I had some of the best red wine I have ever had there ie Amsterdam. We were on the top floor looking out towards the train station and we both would find ourself transfixed to the view. I wasn't expecting to feel the boat move as much as it did but I really enjoyed this aspect as it is so unusual. The bar was good but got busy quickly and the decor could do with a bit more umf. We were a bit disappointed to be allocated a twin bedroom considering we were celebrating our anniversary. I enjoyed the breakfast, all the ingredient to make yourself a bacon roll which was nice to wake up to. We managed to walk to all the main attractions from this location as we didn't try the public transportation as we had enough hassle getting the train from the airport.

The hotel now resides behind the train station across the water, about a mile away. To reach the hotel, exit the train station at the rear (not the front exit that faces Damrak), and turn left onto the main road. There you will see four ferry terminals together; go to the left one out of the four and every 25 minutes or so, a ferry will appear. The ferry terminal sign will say \"NDSM\" The ferry leaves Centraal and goes to the Botel at 15 minutes and 45 minutes past the hour. The ferry leaves the Botel on the hour and half hour, so time this right or you have a long wait for then next trip. There may be two ferries operational at peak times though, so wait times decrease. The last ferry leaves Centraal at 11.45pm. After that you have to ring the Botel up for them to arrange transport - not ideal really. Now, the hotel... It is a very well presented hotel, run efficiently and is generally very good. The rooms are smallish, with a very small toilet/shower area. The shower (in my room at least), was so small as to be very awkward to use. I'm only 6 feet tall as well, so not too big. There is ample storage space for the solo traveller, just enough for couples. A wardrobe and drawers are provided. There is a 14\" TV in the room with a decent selection of English and Dutch channels, including the legendary 24 hour free hardcore porn channel. Great stuff! The windows open very wide, so you can let the sea breeze waft in. Also you can let the smell of weed out! My room stunk and took a day to smell ok, so bring a good air freshener with you if you don't smoke weed. The mattress on the bed was magnificent, I have never slept on such a comfortable bed in all my life. It was great and sorted my bad back out. The pictures on this website don't do the rooms justice in my opinion, as the rooms look dark, dingy and dank in the photo's. In reality they were great and kept clean by the efficient cleaners. The hotel reminds me of a Travelodge to be honest. Basic yet meeting all the required needs.

Reasonable, but it should be a free feature. The breakfast was good, with orange juice, tea, coffee, breads, pastries, meats etc.. laid on. I didn't try the bar or other mealtimes. Overall, this hotel is great and offers good value for money.

The bathroom is even tinier. A sink, a toilet and a shower in a 5' sq. space. The shower is very cramped- having a raised floor and lowered ceiling, with barely enough room to turn around. The toliet is squished between the sink and shower. No ventilation in the loo, either. They offer no wash cloths. It is no smoking- and very serious about no drugs, hard or soft. Despite this, the hallways still smelt like marijuana. Very little street noise, but the floors and ceilings are thin- I was woken up both nights just by people walking up and down the halls.

We stayed in room 316 and have always been lucky enough to be on the 3rd floor - do pay the extra for the canal-view.

My tip - leave the window open when you go out. No-one can get in through the window without a diving suit and a rope ladder!!! The beds are very firm...not uncomfortable firm though - do ask for more pillows as they are very flat. Had we known we could of requested and got more, we would have. There is a small TV in each room showing 40 channels - including BBC1, CNN, BBC NEWS, MTV, various music channel, Film 1 (showing movies constantly), dutch and french channels, porn channel - something for everyone.

The location of the botel is fantastic - literally a 5 min walk from centraal train station and 10 mins (if that) to The Dam (main square in AMS), Damrak and the Red Light District and the flea market. We asked around at various other hotels in the area and they all averaged at about 100 euros per night. Some of these other properties did look slightly dubious - the reception areas were full of people 'smoking the green stuff'!!! Which is fine if you go into a coffeeshop (I can fully recommend Free Adam if you want to try one out - the owners are the most friendliest of people)....however if you want to sit and read the paper or relax in reception you don't necessarily want that going on around you.

The staff were not very friendly, no one said good morning when u went down for breakfast. This hotel is classed as 3 star! More like 1 star, we in the end checked out on Tues after 3 days and had to book into another hotel, i wasnt risking another dump so booked into a 5 star hotel, so all in all we paid for 1 week in the Botel and stayed 3 days, then paid for 4 days in a decent hotel so this has turned out to be a VERY expensive holiday!

The location is very good, being only a short walk from the Centraal station, the Damrak etc. I chose it for the location, and also because I had been there before with my children, as a \"budget\" holiday. I also remembered it having the best hotel breakfast I'd ever had. Well, on a second visit it wasn't as good as I remembered, but then I'm older and more experienced now, so it's coloured by other hotels I've visited since. The room was still small, and the bathroom smaller, which didn't matter so much when I was younger, but is a bit of a problem when you get a bit less mobile. The bed was fine, but the view from the window was awful, being a building site, but I had been warned about this. One problem was the thinness of the walls, I could hear everything that was being said and done next door; not something that worried me with two children (we were probably the ones making the noise) but when I was on my own, it either woke me up or stopped me from getting to sleep. The breakfast was not as good as I remembered it, but my memory may be at fault. The staff were helpful and pleasant. Would I go back again?

But the Botel does have its good points..It is VERY close to central station (5mins walk max) and although the rooms are small thats only to be expected with a hotel of its type, the rooms were immaculate and one thing i liked was the fact that the maids didnt bother you until you hung the wee sign on the outside of your room door saying you wished it to be cleaned, the bathroom is tiny but the shower was brilliant and was plenty of towels with extra ones in the cupboard in the room and there was a remote controlled tv with at least 30 channels including a few english ones, bbc world..music channels etc. Another plus is the fact that there was a vending machine at the top of the stairs in the lobby with cans of heiniken in it (2 euros per can) and loads of soft drinks plus CANS of water and crisps etc. Over all i would have no hesitation in using the Amstel Botel again however if you are planning to stay there, and you think the weather is going to be warm i strongly recommend purchasing some type of travel-fan for using in the rooms at night because your chances of getting one off the hotel are slim.

Yes the room was small but you have to remember at the end of the day u are on a ship ! The shower was very poweful and in some cases too poweful. We had to stop showering now and again for the water to drain. When sat on the toilet u are touching the sink as well, but who cares ? not us ! On arrival the man at reception was not over friendly and we had to pay for the three nights in advance. Once in my bedroom I noticed only two pillows on the bed and went back down to reception to ask for some more. We went out for the evening and I was a little upset as they hadn't arrived and then there was a knock at the door and two more pillows ! In the stair well they have vending machines for soda, beer, crisps and snacks, but the bar on the ship stays open until 12.45am and also has a snooker table, pin ball machine, cd juke box and arcade games. The barmaid did inform us that we should tip her as well when she told us the price, which I thought was a little rude. The breakfast is not worth getting up for early if u have had a late night. Breads, cheese, funny bacon and weird tasting small saugages, with hard boiled eggs and a toaster to 'do-it-youself'. For drinks it was orange guice/apple juice/coffee. Don't even think about a good old cup of tea ! The t.v. is good and they have 24-7 great porn on it, as well as all the dutch stations. No air con in the room, so good idea to keep your window open when u go out in the evening. Its so safe as remember u are on a ship ! The view is wonderful and u can see all over Amsterdam from your window. I slept the three nights with ear plugs in and apparently my partner said he was only woken up once by late night party people. You need to take shampoo, soap and take your own towl, as theres are kinda thin. Also the loo paper is thin, so might be handy to take some tissues as well. At the end of the stay I did ask if the hotel could look after our bags as we had an afternoon flight back to the UK and we had to leave our rooms by 11am. We they took us to a very small room that was so full of bags on top of bags that it didn't look safe at all so we carried them around the town with us.

It was so bad I changed side of the boat (no other canal view rooms available), no view but higher. Well I say no view, there was the view of the railway line (plus the noise) and a construction site (plus the noise). During the process of this room change (around 20 mins) I saw 3 other guests also complaining about the same thing.

I stayed here for 5 nights with my 2 kids age 5 and 8. It was suppose to rain all 5 days and it was the 1st time my daughter was without the stroller. I needed a hotel close to public transportation. This fit the bill. Central station was a stone throw away and we could get busses, trams, and trains very easily. The kids LOVED it. We had a triple and I thought there was plenty of space. Remember - this is a boat. I expected everything to be smaller, but it wasn't. The shower was tight but I've been in much smaller ones. Only one night did we hear anything and it wasn't that loud. We had a room on the 3rd floor - I would recommend 3rd or 4th. I was worried about the porn on the TV but they turned it off without me asking them. We also had 2 or 3 English kids stations to keep the little ones entertained while getting ready in the morning. I would recommend the Botel for families and groups. If you're there with a spouse there are plenty of other small hotels. Amsterdam is great with kids especially Nemo and Tun Fun.

Staff is not all that friendly, they were never rude it was just that they were not there to make your stay just a little more enjoyable with say even a smile or a good morning that would have been nice.

Also we faced towards the city which is located next to the the boardwalk to the hotel and the chinese place and a 1000 other shortcuts and it is very LOUD. whats that you say? Close your window, well cannot since no airconditioning so all I am saying is that it is loud. Also on the first floor people walking by get a straight shot into the room this of course made it hard to enjoy the porn. Curtains were the type that were just about 4 inches to small so always some spot open. and the hotel is nice enough to put a bench for people to sit on right outside the door which puts it outside our window and we were lucky to get every young Brit in town drunk and loud and telling of all his conquests in the red light district which sort of made up for the porn intrusion.

Some friends of mine had previously stayed in the Botel and said it was O.K. however I did have some reservations after reading mixed reviews. I knew the hotel was in a good location being just a stones throw away from centraal station. So after researching a few booking websites (hotels.nl was by far the best deal) I took the plunge. First and formost you must try and get a canal view room which we had.But the problem was it was on the 1st (lower) floor looking at the walkway outside which was a little disappointing as it spoiled the view, but it was still better than looking at the building site and railway on the other side. Our room was a nice size considering this was a boat and the bed was queen size too and very comfortable. And yes, the toilet/shower room is very tiny. If you are 6ft 3ins like me it is a awkward. I was nearly breaking my ribs as I sat on the loo as the sink overlaps the toilet pan!!!! The shower itself was good and powerful. Indeed, the walls are on the thin side and for one night only we had a group of students next door that stayed up chatting and laughing until 4 in the morning. The restuarant was very nice with a good breakfast selection in the morning. The bar and lounge area was quite cosy as well, with pool table,internet access, juke box, pinball table and T.V. My only (and other guests) grumble was it closed too early. I found all the staff most helpful and pleasant. I do have just one other grumble which has been mentioned by other reviewers and that's the smell of dope that often drifts around the corridors especially when you return to the hotel from a night out. Personally I can't stand the stench and I feel the management should stamp it out. Smoking dope should be confined to the coffee bars and other bars of the red light district.

We had an excellent time which was compounded by two things, firstly the Amstel Botel and secondly the weather! We chose the Botel because I had stayed there 7 years ago when I visited A'dam with a friend. I couldn't remember much about it other than there was nothing bad about the place which is the sort of thing you don't forget too quickly. After a disgusting stay at The ACCA Hotel in February 2004 (don't go there whatever you do) we wanted to stay somewhere clean, friendly and close to the action. I decided the Botel was the place for us and what a great decision I made. The place was welcoming, friendly, clean and tidy. We received excellent service from all the staff, the breakfast was good, the room was very clean and bedding and towels were changed daily if you hung the cleaning card on your door, if you don't do that you probably won't get clean sheets etc which possibly explains a few of the bad reviews about the Botel. There was no major noise to report and the bathroom though small was exceptionally clean. The bed was comfy enough for three nights and the view over the canal was fantastic to say the least. We were on the top floor which made everything just perfect as when the sun shines over the canal the view is lovely. The rooms are small but what do people really expect, if you want the Mariott then pay for it. I knew from the moment we walked in and my girlfriend gave it the seal of approval saying \"I really like it, its great\" that everything was gonna be fine. That coming from anyone is not a really bold statement I suppose but as she is a Reservations Supervisor for a very large and expensive 4 star UK Hotel Group I think it says a helluva lot for the Botel. All in all we couldn't really fault the place, I would, without exception, recommend it to anyone.

The pictures made it look really nice and clean - but we were to find out otherwise. After trying to check in, an ordeal in which the concierge accused me of credit card fraud repeatedly, which entailed my having to walk back up to centraal station to use the ATM and pay for the room in cash, we were given our keys. The room didn't look terrible at first glance - just a bit small. Then we noticed the holes in the curtains, the stains on the walls, the dank, unclean little bathroom with a very suspicious shower, and stains all over our towels!! We wanted to take a nap, but the sheets looked like they hadn't been changed and as though one could catch lice from them, and the bedspreads were cheap and scratchy. We also noticed on our first evening that people were looking through the windows and seeing everything we were doing! Our first \"breakfast buffet\" there proved to be disgusting, with just cold cuts and some old looking cheese, and having to pay an absurd amount for any extra beverage, like juice. The staff, for the duration of the trip, was exceptionally rude to us, and refused to answer any questions. This is not including, however, the night clerk, an older Indian man, who was VERY friendly and helpful - the only nice person working at the Botel! As for safety : My friend and I went out late at night and came back late at night, and were always wary of what we called, \"The Rape Trail\" - the long, isolated metal pathway along the side of the Botel (a note to girls staying alone : be very careful around this area, we were approached many times by creepy older men around the entrance to the botel's pier thing) On the upside, the botel itself had good security. We had to use our keys to open the hotel doors after a certain hour, and when I brought a friend back into my room, the very nice night clerk politely told him that only Botel guests were allowed into the hotel As for the view : the back side of the ship faced a massive industrial site with a garbage truck, where they are construction the \"Ode to Amsterdam\", and a pungent aroma rose over the whole hotel - not to mention the strange noises that began at around 8am and woke us up While the botel is easy to get to and find, it is somewhat removed from the center of town, so if you want to check out nightlife, it's definitely not a good place to stay one more thing : never saw any sign of the \"free in -house movies\" so proudly advertised on the side of the Botel All in all - I would NOT reccomend the Botel - there are much cleaner facilities for what you pay for, and the charm of staying on a boat is massively overshadowed by how dirty the hotel is, and how rude it's (daytime) staff is", "Date": "August 29, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winona, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cStaff was helpful\u201d", "Author": "stoas", "ReviewID": "UR2329805", "Content": "Our overnight flight from the US arrived in Amsterdam at 5 am, so we arrived at the Botel before 7 am, fully expecting to have to stash our luggage and wander about in a daze until the 2 pm check-in time.

As others have mentioned, the rooms are small (but so are a lot of European hotel rooms-- get used to it.) They are very clean, and I never had any noise problems from my neighbors. The canal-side rooms do have a better view, but cost more. They also expose you to the noise of everyone walking on the dock that runs alongside the boat. The land-side rooms face a huge consruction project that looks like it will go on for a few years. All in all, I was happy with our stay.

If you're looking at hostels, put this one in the mix. It is priced accordingly, too, as it is cheaper than many hostels available in Amsterdam. You definitley get what you pay for here. The rooms were very clean, and I found the staff to be quite friendly. No service problems or anything like that. The internet in the hotel has its on and off moments. There's a convenient cigarette vending machine and soda machine that accept only coin fare. The bar sells candy, and after hours, the reception desk takes on the candy selling responsibilities. The rooms were very tiny, and the bathroom was the bare minimum in size. Queen beds are really just 2 twins pushed together. There is a hard space in between. Couples are actually better just opting for the twin beds cause you get what seems to be a little more room and a center little tabletop area. Really, romance isn't one of the qualities Botel has to offer. The beds, however, are pretty comfortable. There is a desk and small closet with a safe as well. Television has the basics, including MTV, and 24 hour dutch porn (just channels away from the cartoon stations during the morning and afternoon-so watch out for your kids). We had the non-water view, which was one of the loudest and least comforting views I've ever experienced from a hotel room. The noise of the trains arriving and departing from very nearby Central Station combined with the sound of shoveling and huge construction machinery becomes almost unbearable by 2:00AM, and from what I understand, the sound isn't much more muffled from the front of Botel. However, the view is 200% better when facing the water. This cannot be stressed more. Added to the sound of construction and trains are the sounds of the other guests in the nearby rooms. The walls are paper thin and one can make out quite clearly the conversations of neighbors. Be advised. The location was great. Close to central station (literally next door), and a 10 minute walk to Dam Square. Basic jist - If you're a light sleeper, don't stay here. If you're looking for a decent clean, and semi-comfortable room in a good location at a good price, and don't mind the squeaks, rumbles, and bangs going throughout the evening, shaking you in your bed, this place is totally cool. Luxury it is not. I will not stay here again, but don't necessarily regret the money we saved, as we put that into a really nice hotel in the end of the trip. Also, there is a clearly marked \"no marijuana smoking\" sign on the rule manual in the room. I don't think this is strictly enforced, but be cautious for those of you who want to take something back to the room from the coffeeshops.", "Date": "June 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cBasic, overpriced and noisy neighbours!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2183952", "Content": "Very basic hotel, which was fine by us, but we thought it was way over priced.

Believe me, after a long flight, the last thing you need is the stress of trying to find your way around the streets or figure out the public transportation system. Take a nap first! Not only was the Botel right outside the station, if we were ever lost trying to find our way home, we could just ask people for directions to the station.
