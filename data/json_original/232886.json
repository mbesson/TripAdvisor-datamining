After reading reviews that there are many rooms outdated, We decided not to take a chance and booked in advance superior room. Do you think it helped? - Maybe in another hotel which is run in a more fair but not at this hotel. Construction took place on the top floor of the hotel and every day from 08:00 am until 16:00 pm there were loud noises of construction in the room we got. The first day the reception said that it's a one-time fix that will end in two hours And when we came back and complained they suggested that we move into more simple room. Because we were promised that the noise will stop in two hours - we preferred to stay in our superior room, And we were afraid to have a room out of date as written in reviews here. After the next morning we heard bangs and noises of construction - We turned the hotel manager. I never met a man so antipathetic. He stood in front of us and repeated the sentence - \"I have nothing to do now\". I asked him how did he sold the room in advance if you knew he was having building work over - And he told us that the Italian law allows him to make noise between these hours - I told him we were guests of the hotel and we came on holiday and rest and we are not long-term residents who live across the street that He can answer them this answer. But there was no one to talk to and we had to go through hell for three more days.

Where to begin - Rome was the middle leg of our 2 week stay in Italy. We arrived at the hotel after an almost 3 hour trip from our first destination which included taking a taxi, speed train, metro, and then the short walk to the hotel (but on cobbled stone streets with luggage). We were very happy to enter the hotel and got to the front desk where nobody looked up to greet us. After about 5 minutes a man acknowledged us and informed us that we were an hour too early for checking into our rooms. We said we were tired, on our honeymoon, was there any way to get in our rooms a bit earlier? He said no but took our bags to a safe place and gave us a map to walk to the Trevi Fountain. It was a hot day in Rome and the Trevi Fountain (as always) was very crowded. Not the ideal start, but we were determined to make it a good stay! We entered our room - small, two twins pushed together (the norm in Europe), but here's the clincher - we had a flush that didn't work. We went downstairs and informed a man about this, who promised to look after it. We left the hotel to get lunch and become familiar with our surroundings, we get back to our room an hour later and find the flush is still in the same situation. We go downstairs, and the man actually gets exasperated with US saying we are being \"impatient\" with the flush (the problem was that the flush was so weak none of the contents were disappearing... to put it politely). Anyways, what resulted was a long back and forth that if I was feeling gracious I would pin as simple \"miscommunication\" but in reality we were being treated with a lot of hostility and defensiveness. He wasn't listening to what we were saying, wasn't trying to understand, and not going an inch out his way to provide any sort of customer service. Due to the fatigue, I ended up bursting into tears out of sheer frustration and the man ended up still making us wait in the lobby for ten minutes as he finished his work on his computer before coming up to our room and finally understanding what we meant (we had to show him). After that, things got much better. We were moved to a better room, free of charge. Needless to say, that was not how we wanted to be treated while on our honeymoon, and it made us want to spend as little time in the hotel as possible so we could avoid the staff. To their credit, they always made an effort to be polite during the remaining 3 days we had at the hotel, but it all just left us with a bad taste in our mouth. Plus points: awesome breakfast - I miss the chocolate croissants. The location is FANTASTIC, you're really at the very centre and Rome is such a fantastic and easy city to navigate on foot. I would not recommend this hotel as a honeymoon hotel, but if you're looking for a decent, affordable place to stay in the city, and don't care too much about service or the rooms - this is a good bet.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cthink twice - not reliable\u201d", "Author": "tamilon s", "ReviewID": "UR124991885", "Content": "we made a reservation to 22/12/11 due to the good location and good price, and the \"free cancellation policy\". then we read here about the constraction and other bad reviews, so we cancelled our reservation - we made a few cancellation notices - by phone, by e mail, and by the hotel's web site in 14/11/12. we made a reservation to another hotel - IQ Hotel - it was great. when we got back home, we were very disappointed to se that hotel petris charged our credit card... we wrote a lot of e mails to the hotel to remind them that we've never been to this hotet and that we cancelled our reservation 5 weeks before. all that didn't help - the hotel argue's that they didn't get our notices and they refuse to give us back our money. i don't belive them. to my oppinion, it is not safe to give them cerdit cards details.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burntwood", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and convenient\u201d", "Author": "LizB737", "ReviewID": "UR124729518", "Content": "We have just returned from spending four nights in the hotel - we were in the annexe across the road.

The bathroom lacked space to put your personal toiletries. I did ask for a room change but what was offered was basically the same. We just decided not to change rooms as it was not worth the bother. The staff was polite yet cold and removed. The woman who runs the place was very loud perhaps that was her way of talking. Breakfast was nothing special - satisfactory.

On the 4 night stay, we were given room #121 which was across the street in another building (not far at all, their street is more like a small alley!). The room was very spacious, with a separate bathroom, one room had the toilet and the other room had the shower and sink. The shower was a little tricky, it had a normal shower head above, and a lower hand held wand below, but in the middle were 4 sprayers that made you feel like you were in a car wash. The shower was a capsule like unit and something that I had never seen before. Once we figured out how to use all of the options, it was fine. The room had 2 flat screen TVs. One in the shower/sink area and one in the bedroom area. The mini bar frig was filled with water/soda/beer and left room for only 2-3 bottles or water that we purchased. When we stayed for one night on the end of our trip we also had a room across the street but the room was REALLY small (room #220). I am not sure if the longer stays get the larger rooms and the 1-2 night stays get the smaller room, but this room had about 12-18 inches on 2 sides of the bed and that was it! The bathroom was all in one, with a normal shower and toilet/sink area all in one small room. There were also 2 flat screen TVs, one in the bathroom and one in the bedroom. Both rooms had safes that were large enough for a 15 inch laptop. There is a Despar grocery store at the end of the street (turn right on the \u2018main street\u2019 out of the hotel) which is good for getting water, drinks, fruit, bread, snacks, etc. The nearest metro stop is Barberini which is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. We did the private transfer both to and from the airport (FCO), which the hotel arranged and was 46-49 euros for the one way transfer. Upon arrival at FCO, there will be a guy with a sign with your name and the hotel name and it is easy to find. The ride to/from the airport is about 35-45 minutes, depending on traffic. The breakfast at the hotel is served starting at 7am and you can either eat inside or out on a patio area. They make the croissants right there which gives a good breakfast aroma when you arrive. It is a standard cold buffet, including meat/cheeses, cold cereal, yogurt, Tomato/mozzarella, breads/rolls, juices, hard boiled eggs (which are actually warm). Also, they will make you cappiciano or espresso in addition to the standard American coffee and hot tea. We discovered that the only milk for the cereal was in the pitcher next to the coffee machine, the other options were warm/room temperature goat\u2019s milk and also soy milk. The hotel offers free wifi as well as 2 computers in the lobby (one with a printer as well)., You are given a sign in and password to use and it appears that you are being charged (it shows a declining balance as you use it), but it really is free so don\u2019t worry about being charged. We asked the front desk for dinner suggestions and they actually have a little card with 5 restaurants listed on it. We tried 3 of the 5 and they were all really good. We actually went to the one directly across the street twice because we liked it so much. Be sure to have the front desk make a reservation, they open at 730pm and are quite busy with locals and tourists as well. The prices were reasonable, we had 1 salad, 1 pasta entr\u00e9e, 1 meat entr\u00e9e, waster and \u00bd carafe of house wine and with the service fee it was usually 35-40 euros (at all 3 places we ate dinner) I would recommend this hotel for it\u2019s great location (5 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain), good breakfast and free wifi. The rooms can be hit or miss in size and I am not sure how the rooms are in the actual building where the check in desk is located, but staying across the street was really not a problem (as someone else had mentioned).", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "MarciaOttawa", "ReviewID": "UR117125684", "Content": "We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel De Petris.

I can see this being a problem if you have neighbors who stay out late--the slamming can definitely wake someone up. -No screens on the windows means that an occasional bug can crawl in if you leave the windows open too long. Other reviewers have complained about value, but overall, we thought this was a good value compared to prices of other hotels online. However, we are not regular travelers to Rome. At the time we were trying to book, it was hard to find any decent places for under $200, but this was one of them. We were very happy with our stay.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "Laura A", "ReviewID": "UR116749426", "Content": "This hotel was an excellent location to stay and was a few minutes walk from the Trevi fountain.

I REALLY wanted to like it there. But I had a feeling in the pit of my stomach since I booked it and instincts are usually right. All I can do is be as fair as possible so here goes... Location: I really liked the location as many reviewers have said. It's the main reason I went with it. Very convenient for walking most of Rome's major sites. It was amazing to be able to walk past Fontana di Trevi every day only a few short blocks away. It's an ideal location. However, the street it's on is rather infuriating and that's where my issues started. We couldn't pull in or park anywhere to unload our suite cases. So we had to pull around a corner and lug six suit cases plus numerous other odds and ends over cobblestone streets/alleys with very unforgiving Roman drivers ready to mow us down. Not the way I wanted to start my stay in Rome. Staff: Mostly good. Nearly everyone spoke English quite well which was a huge plus for us. Overall, the staff really came through for us. Facilities: When we arrived, the elevator to our floor (there are three different ones that bring you to different floors) was out of commission. Carrying six suite cases and more up five flights of stairs!!!??? Thankfully, they took care of that for us while we went out to eat. The hotel basically consists of a very small reception area (hard to call it a lobby), a small sitting area, a common area/courtyard for breakfast and then a labyrinth of rooms. A bit old and tired and out of date but showing of character. The rooms: Looking at their website, you'd think...wow, nice. There's a reason you don't see the standard rooms photographed. And shame on me for not realizing (I booked through a travel agent and didn't know there were additional upgrade options). The rooms we were in...well, I'm not sure how to describe them. What I can say is that we were given two rooms (triple rooms) on the 4th floor that made me want to pack up and leave that moment. The next day, I asked about being moved to rooms that were more \"acceptable\". Thankfully, they were very accommodating and even let us look at the rooms first. It turns out, these were the superior rooms. I have to say, these rooms were not just MUCH nicer, but they're what you expect a room to be. Unless you simply have low expectations. So the new rooms were nicely decorated, the space was quite huge by any standards, and the bathroom was quite nicely modern. Beds were pretty good. Overall, enough space for all our stuff. Breakfast: I have to say I was not a fan. I'm glad they had something, but I couldn't stomach more than a pastry and yogurt. But it got us going each day. Little things: In order to control the temperature in your room, you have to call the front desk. At least for air conditioning. I found that...interesting. Especially in July. In summary, if you book a superior room I think you'll be pleased. You'll think it's a quaint, unique and quirky place that's got some interesting character. You'll certainly love the location. The access to Rome is fantastic from here. Just be sure you know you're getting one of their renovated rooms. Another thing to note is the restaurant across the street (Hostaria Romana) was a hit. The bucatini all'amatriciana was out of this world.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern ireland", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant Hotel we will definately be back!!\u201d", "Author": "joss7166", "ReviewID": "UR115542157", "Content": "This hotel is 5 minutes walk from the trevi fountain and the metro stop. 20 minutes from the spanish steps.

Our rooms were across the little cobble street from the reception, lovely rooms with large flatscreen tv,mini fridge and modern decor, bathrooms were fab,with double power shower,bidet hairdryer,toiletries,lovely towels changed each day, and even a television. ! Breakfast in the morning was buffet style, with cold meats,eggs,cheese,cereals,juices,croissants etc. Reception staff were extremely helpful and always willing to answer our questions. The hotel does not have a bar like many others of its size but 2 minutes down the street was a little english pub called Arthurs where we had a drink each night on way back to hotel. Five minutes in the other direction is the Metro station but we only used this once as we were iwithin walking distance of everything. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Rome,it is not 5 star but if its location,friendliness,and value for money then its the place to go 1", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Platanias, Greece", "Title": "\u201cNot a good hotel to stay at!\u201d", "Author": "Helterscelter1", "ReviewID": "UR94492694", "Content": "We went there for christmas, the city is fabulous but if we had the chance to change hotel we'd do it in a heartbeat. The gave us a room on the 5th floor which was their \"superior\" room. Not even for a joke. The room was dirty, the bathroom was smelling all the time and the water when you were washing in the basin or the shower would not go down the drain. As for sound isolation better forget it. Our room was connecting with another room which they sell as 2 different rooms. They could put a curtain between the two rooms instead of this very thin door. Also if there was a fire issue and you were only at the room on the right, there is no escape exit as the emergency door is through the other room so if the middle door is locked you can not leave and also you cannot take the elevator for safety reasons during a fire and which is extremely slow!!! Also the elevator works only with your room card and they give you only one, so if you want to go downstairs to the lobby and your wife stays in room, of course she needs the card for the electricity to work. But then, you have to go by foot 5 floors. But the worse thing was that we stayed for 4 nights and every single morning we went to the breakfast room we had to wait standing up for about 10 minutes everytime for a table to vacate. It was a very crouded hotel with such a small breakfast room. Unecceptable service for the amount of money we paid. We tried to find another hotel but just before christmas that was impossible as everything was fully booked.

A lot of reviewers complain about the odd old-fashioned elevator, but now the hotel has a new modern one, attached to the building from the inner courtyard. The breakfast was OK: some vegetables, cheese, ham, croissants, tea, coffee. In May the trees in the hotel\u2019s courtyard were blossoming and giving incredible pleasant scent. Walking out to the terrace in the morning and breathing in the scent was a perfect start for each of our days in Rome.

We were placed in Room 410. This room was all that you would expect of Italy and then some. A combination of exquisite style, old fashioned lift (I loved the stairs) - the feeling of just being in the heart of a city full of life, love and history - the Hotel De Petris was a breath of fresh air. The difference between staying at the \"famous\" hotel brands or such like was the feeling of being part of the city and people itself. This was living the \"real Italy\" not what you could find in a \"chain store type of Hotel arrangement\" - so it was my preference. We were within walking, taxi or even bus distance (should we have chosen the bus) from everything we wished to see. Again, it came down to being one of the city's people rather than a visitor. All aspects of the Hotel's services were outstanding. Breakfast, storage for baggage when heading down to the Amalfi Coast, their patience and assistance with endless questions, or requests. Their staff, in particular Katia Filice who went beyond her work remit, again became a friend, and whom I made sure was thanked in person - as well as talking to both Silvio and Rosella so they knew they had an exceptional staff member working for them.

The plaster was falling off the walls, the curtains were gray with dust, and the bedspread was stained and had holes in it. I booked the \u201cstandard\u201d room to save a little money, but this room was filthy and that is something I can\u2019t abide. The shower head was mounted at knee level and no matter how hard we tried to keep the water in the tub area, we both flooded the entire bathroom. While out site seeing I dreaded going back to that room. We asked to be moved but they were full and said we could move the following day. The second room was much nicer; freshly painted with new draperies and bedspread. A big improvement. All the reviews about the rudeness of the staff are true. I should have gotten a clue when I emailed the hotel a few days before leaving on our trip to reconfirm my reservation. For some reason they had not gotten my confirmation information and I had no room guarantee, yet no one notified me that the expected information had not arrived. If I had not been obsessive about everything being in order I could have arrived in Rome with no place to stay! They are very unhelpful with directions, restaurant suggestions, etc. They act as if you are a bother. Both my husband and I are pretty good at disarming unfriendly people, but there was no softening with any of them. The worst was when I said very politely that I was disappointed in my room the owner practically started yelling at me. He acted as if the holes in the bedspread were a surprise and kept saying that it was made of very expensive fabric. I personally don\u2019t care what something cost, if it\u2019s dirty and holey it needs to be replaced.

This is not one of them. The shock of such poor service at this hotel, from the moment we arrived, tarnished our excitiement of being in such a mind blowing city. When you first enter the 'lobby' you see front desk staff in smart suits and a beautifully presented polished reception desk. Very impressive. There is nothing impressive to follow. We were checked in by 'robotic' staff who lacked personally and never showed any kind of hospitality training. We struggled carrying our bags through some clumbsy doors which led to the lift area. No one offered to assist us...they just watched. Whne we got to the lift...it was (to be polite) quirky. It was so small and ancient, you had to laugh. It was ridiculous. My mother and I had one bag each and for us to fit in the lift and close the door, I had to actually sit on my luggage. No joke. Please note: there is a new fantastic modern glass lift recently built out in the courtyard...but don't get too excitied...it doesn't go to all floors! After the laughing and struggling with our bags, we were really looking forward to just getting into our room. What a surprise! I can imagine this is what a juvenile detention room must look like (minus the bars on the windows of course). The glass in the mirrors were old and discoloured, not in a lovely distressed vintage way either. The carpets were stained and had food crumbs next to the bed. Speaking of beds...we booked a suite with two queen beds. We got two single beds, which wasn't a huge disaster except the room was so small there was no room to walk between the beds on one side and they were pushed against the wall on the other. No room for luggage on the floor or on a table/desk area. I slept crunched up with my luggage on the end of my bed. My mother had to put her luggage on the grubby and tired bathroom floor. The builders started banging and crashing at about 6.30am. Our window was open for ventilation and we started the day with cigarette smoke drifting into our room from the builders. It wasn't a huge problem as we wanted an early start, but it may be a problem if you like to sleep in. The cold buffet breakfast wasn't terrible, but just ok. Nothing too inspiring. You may be thinking, did you make a complaint? Well...yes we did. The manager/ owner was 'missing in action' for a while, but he did eventually appear, dressed in a white, expensive looking fine Italian suit with gold dripping from every limb. He said as we had paid in full prior to our arrival, he had no other rooms available and he had already allocate our money to his renovations, there wasn't a lot he could do. We had no option but to stay at this disappointing and depressing hotel for another 6 days. I think our final conversation with the owner really does sum up our entire stay. He was enthusiastically telling my mother and I (in perfect English) about his wonderful adventures traveling around the world. He told us of his dreams to turn his hotel into a luxury world renowned hotel like the others he has stayed in - you'll be happy to know he has lots of good ideas he has brought back with him. As we were walking out the door, my mother turned to him and asked \"You have stayed in some lovely hotels haven't you?\" he replied \"Yes I have\".

If you keep going past the hotel the Trevi fountain is less than 5 minutes away and there are some nice bars and restaurants. Tour buses a great way to see the city, lots of stops, lots of buses, and good commentary.

One thing we were disappointed with, there is no Hotel Bar, or tea-making in the rooms - we would have liked to have returned after a hot day to a rest and drink in our room and it would have been nice to have a drink before setting off to eat in the evening. I would bring travel kettle another time. Our room was rather small for 3, I had the camp bed intended for children, but for a short stay no problem.

The breakfast is average, consisting of croissants, bread rolls, cheese etc. Be warned that you must get to breakfast early because the food is gone very quickly and only the basics get replenished. The juice was undrinkable for me. Whilst the rooms are lovely, the hotel is undergoing renovations and has the world's smallest elevator.
