We keep coming back becuase the level of service, staff professionalism and courteousness is a constant. Our room this time was 2 queen room, great beds, room that served our family of 3. The bathroom was clean and tidy with basic toiletries if needed. We did not take advantage of the breakfast this time but have in the past and it has always been good. The big seller for us on this hotel is the park and fly program, we stay the night, they keep the car for the week, in our case it was 12 days and there was no additional charge. My one concern this time is the restaurant on site, they have moved away from a traditional sit down environment where you order off the menu with a waitress to a system now where you walk in, look at the large order board at the cash register, order all items at one time, pay and then seat yourself. The menu is not quite at extensive as it has been in the past, still quite good but the overall process left a little to be desired. Would this one change make me look elsewhere the next time I travel from Seatac, probably not, my son loves the pool, the price for the night is great and the staff truly appreciate you.

The only recommendation that I would give is to avoid any rooms facing the street. The windows and patio doors aren't very sound-proof, so you could hear the road traffic . It wasn't really an issue for me personally as I sleep with earplugs but it could be a big issue for people that are sensitive to sound at night.

Billing...You be the judge... WITHOUT PREJUDICE: Ms. Trudeau, My reservation that was booked was booked for $79 plus tax for the complete park and fly package. If my reservation was only changed after check-in to seperate the parking part of my stay, and the room part of my stay because you billed it at 2 seperate tax rates, then why would you leave the separated rate of $79.00 plus tax posted to my online account without posting the other part of the charge that you say was for the parking portion. Perhaps, the Best Western website does not allow you to post this breakdown onto a clients account, as this would cause less confusion. I haven never had this type of error with any of the six hotel chains that I hold memberships with. As this was my first stay with your chain, I can only conclude that it is more important to defend your errors than to satisfy a potential future guest. Again, I was completely satisfied with your efficient and friendly staff, along with the cleanliness and comfort of the room, but your explanation of why my account only shows the rate of $79.00 plus tax leaves me wondering how a hotel chain, as well known as yours, could let something like this happen. I can only hope such future occurances with other guests will warrant changes to your billing practices. Sincerely, William Roy Codling ------------------------------------ Mr. Codling, Your reservation that was booked was booked at the rate of $119 plus tax, which is also what you signed for at check-in, and is our regular park and fly rate. Your reservation was only changed after check-in to seperate the parking part of your stay, and the room part of your stay because they are billed at 2 seperate tax rates, which is why it would show, after your check-in that your reservation was billed at $79, the parking does not show on the room rate portion of best western reservation information.\u00c2\u00a0 I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silverdale, Washington, United States", "Title": "\u201cPark & Fly\u201d", "Author": "Sharon P", "ReviewID": "UR124992747", "Content": "To park your car there for a week and get a room for the night with a full continental breakfast and free shuttle service to an dfrom Seatac for about $140 is not too bad.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington State", "Title": "\u201cFree parking, Good Wifi, Food onsite, & Cheap\u201d", "Author": "mcksh", "ReviewID": "UR124546846", "Content": "I've been staying here several times a month for the last 4 months and I've come to appreciate it.

Offered us all kinds of information about the area and the hotel and gave us lots of help with our bags. Check-in was slow due to long line and only one employee, but employee was very helpful. Got a snack and a few drinks before the restaurant closed at 10:00pm. For a Best Western, the room was nicely updated. Large granite bathroom countertop in the larger-than-expected bathroom, new furnishings, beds, and bedding inside, dare I say almost a Hiltonesque look to it. It had a private balcony overlooking a parking lot. Didn't use the balcony on the short \"layover\" stay but did verify the locks on the door worked well. The complimentary all-you-can-eat breakfast was better than expected. Hot and cold food options, fresh fruit, cold and hot drinks. Was really surprised at the quality. The only real \"cons\" I can think of was that there was really nothing of interest around the hotel. I asked the hotel if there was a convenience store nearby and was told it wasn't safe to walk there but they would be happy to give me a free ride. +1 for the free ride offer, -1 for the sketchy neighborhood. Another con was all the hallway noise. Both people talking were very loud and the room doors slammed very loud. Whenever somebody in the hallway came or left their room the door slammed loudly, waking us up. The only other negative was that the business center had no internet. I don't know if it was just \"down\" during my stay but I tried all 3 computers and none of them had internet. The free return shuttle to the airport left right on time. Every part of the hotel was clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast was great, and the rooms were nicely updated and decorated.

The free breakfast is well done, waffles, eggs, sausage, biscuits, cereral, toast, bagels, juice, coffee, tea, etc. It's best to get there early beacuse the late risers stream in after 9 and the place fills up fast and food bins empty and silverware disappears. The breakfast area also serves as a dining room for dinner and I have to say it's one of the best hotel restuarants I've eaten in. The portions are large and the meals are VERY inexpensive. The two waitresses that served us the 4 times we ate there were the nicest people you could ask to meet. As others have noted, the location is in a semi-industrial area so having a car is a must. There is an IHOP nearby and a Safeway, both within walking distance. Other than that, you're out of luck. The free shuttle is great too, they'll take you to the airport where you can catch the light rail into Seattle and they will also drop you off at a couple of nice restuarants near the airport, 13 Coins and Sharps. Tip the guy a few bucks whenever you ride...they do a great job. I held off giving them 5 stars because we had called ahead the first time we stayed there to make sure we had a roll-away bed in our room since there were 5 of us and when we arrived (at 11:30PM) there was no roll-away bed and none were available. My son had to sleep on the floor on numerous blankets and pillows. They did give us a discount for our troubles though.

At the airport, we arrived in time for the shuttle to the hotel, but it was packed and there was no room for our families' luggage, so we had to wait for the next shuttle. The driver said he'd be back in 10-15 minutes, but it was half an hour before he appeared again. (This is more in line with the hotel's statement that the shuttle departs every half hour.) Due to this experience, although we were booked to stay at the BW Executel again before our return flight at 7 am, I decided to move to a hotel closer to the airport in case we ran into trouble and had to grab a taxi. However, the hotel itself was fine, if quirky. As others have said, I expected a more upscale place based on the name. Instead, it's a renovated older hotel. We had a room on the 2nd (top) floor, and were told to push 3 in the elevator, which brought us to a hall that was separated from the rest of the 2nd floor by a small stairway. The room (2 queens) was large, but I was so tired while I was there that I didn't register much about it other than that it had a dispenser for soap, shampoo, and conditioner in the shower (see picture) instead of bottles of shampoo and bars of soap. This saves on plastic and unused shampoo, soap, etc., but it was kind of weird. There was one bar of soap provided at the sink, and I used that in the shower too rather than the liquid soap. My daughter and I looked at the pool and exercise room but due to a tight schedule we didn't use either one. The pool is indoors, smallish and kind of kidney shaped, 3 ft to 6 ft deep. There is a courtyard with 2 wings of rooms surrounding it and I saw picnic tables with umbrellas in the courtyard which might have been a nice place to hang out. There's not much of a lobby, but 2 large breakfast rooms, with the standard waffle-maker, etc. large breakfast. The people at the front desk were a bit overworked and harried; there were a lot of people staying here when we were here. Our night was quiet and we slept well, but woke around 8 am since we were still on East Coast time. When we returned from breakfast, the maids were already starting to clean the rooms, and it wasn't even 9 yet. I felt bad for people who tried to sleep in! Be sure to hang a Do Not Disturb sign on your door if you do plan to sleep in here. All in all, everything was fine and we would have returned here if we didn't have an early flight booked to return home. this hotel isn't as close to the airport as others are, which makes it maybe a bit quieter but it takes a bit longer to get to the airport, too.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Langley City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cUnimpressive.\u201d", "Author": "SJSmithbc", "ReviewID": "UR116962542", "Content": "The term 'Executel' is not helpful.

Because of the special needs situation, we booked (a month in advance) one of the rooms with a rollaway so each person would have a bed. This was confirmed by phone a week before the trip. On arrival the desk clerk gave us our keys indicating which room had the rollaway. Getting to the room we discovered there was was space for a rollaway, but it was not in the room. A call to the desk got the reassurance that cots were only brought to the rooms after check in - it would be there soon. We went out for supper and on return called again to inquire when the rollaway would be delivered. \"Very soon\" we were assured. Took the kids to the pool and on returning to the room it was time to put them to bed so called again to ask about the cot. The rude and dismissive night manager told me it was far too late to ask for one, they were only available on a first come first served basis but he could bring some pillows so I could sleep on the floor. I don't expect hotels to fully appreciate or attempt to accommodate the challenges of traveling with special needs kids, but I do expect some degree of truth and courtesy when making a very common, basic request.

We were quickly checked in by Elizabeth, who answered all our questions, and checked on the arrangements the hotel had made for our shuttle to Pier 91 the next morning. (Also reasonably priced) Our friends went to downtown, and we stayed to take care of some business via fax from the hotel. We dined in the hotel restaurant which had excellent service. Our friends came back bragging about the wonderful Ivars clam chowder they had. Well we had that too in the Executel restaurant, and it was delicious. I do not recommend the fish and chips (probably a Texan thing), but everything else was great. The complimentary breakfast was better than your average hotel breakfast. There was a nice place for us to play \u00e2\u20ac\u015342\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the atrium overlooking the indoor pool. Every staff person we met was very friendly and helpful.

We will definitely stay there again when we are in Seattle. We had asked for a handicapped room, but when we saw how far away it was (I use a walker) they gave us 108A which is a regular Queen.

I was whisked away to room 180 which was a dream come true, large enough for all his medical equipment, and room to walk around, a walk in tub, which was all we really needed insofar as help in the bathroom and we were in heaven.

You can also take the shuttle to the airport and catch the metro to downtown Seattle for $5 round-trip. The trip downtown via metro takes about 45 minutes.

I dropped off the rental car on return and was picked up at Thrifty Rental Car place in less than 10 minutes. Shuttle to airport on last morning was great and on time as well-tell them when you need to leave-they depart every half hour in the morning.

They had waffles, juice, coffee, and all the usual. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember any meat-think they had some sausage gravy but not sure. It was a very basic no-frills breakfast. Both rooms-2 queen sized beds-ok-4 pillows each-form rubber not firm enough for me. TV with over 70 channels, chest of drawers (3 drawers) under tv for storage, refrigerator, coffee/tea maker with ample supplies. Shower only. No toiletries except one bar of soap. Soap, shower, and conditioner dispenser in shower-there was sign saying more supplies available at front desk, if needed. Chair and table-no desk-no safe. a/c ok did job not too noisy. Occassional plane passing over-but you're staying near the airport so expected. Room #16-backside lowest level of hotel over looking parking lot-nothing special but did the job. Room needs a little more lighting or brighter bulbs. Water in shower fluctuates between very hot and lukewarm-can be dangerous. Room #180-much better-at end of hall on first floor (really 2nd floor). Quieter and larger than room #16-more open space but same furniture set up. Good view to side/back of hotel-trees with autumn leaves (see recent reviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s photo) -100 yards of open space then some houses. Common areas: 3 free Internet terminals with printer in secure locked room accessible by room key. Pool and exercise room looked fine but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use.

We chose to turn our rental in directly before flying out so I didn't experience their shuttle service, but it was there and boarding passengers when we left early. Also, our back window faced west, and we watched a beautiful sunset, along with a nice view of an undeveloped lot which housed georgeous fall foliage. See pic! Taken from room 278.

The breakfast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gourmet but was enough to get you going and last until lunch, although heavy on the starch (waffles, biscuits & gravy, toast). Boiled eggs and apples/bananas were served too. The staff were really helpful giving all sorts of information. They recommended and reserved a restaurant (providing free shuttle van) that was located right on the waterfront, making for a perfect Seattle setting on our last night. The only fault is that the hallways desperately need to be remodeled. On the first stay, when walking to my room down the drab, tattered carpet, scratched up hallway, I was very apprehensive of what the room would be like.

All of the hotels in the area offer these deals, I suggest that you consider other hotels before staying here. When we arrived at the hotel after 10 nights in Hawaii we checked into our room. My wife immediately noticed that the toilet seat was dirty. I reported this to the front desk and they moved us to a different room. When I went out to check on my vehicle I discovered that it had been broken into sometime while we were away. Nothing was taken, but there was about $1000 damage. I reported this to the hotel front desk person and he seemed indifferent. After looking around at thier long term parking area it became clear to my why my vehicle was not safe there. Thier parking area sits lower than the main street outside, so there is no line of sight into the parking lot from the roadway. Also the area is very poorly lit - a fact I could not have known when I first parked there in the daytime. If staying at one of these park & stay hotels be sure to have a good look around at the parking lot first. This hotel was not very impressive at all, which is unfortunate because I have always relied on the Best Western name when I see one in an unfamiliar town.

I was eating breakfast and my husband came from exercising to tell me that his key was not working. My key also failed. The two staff at the desk were very polite and tried their keys which also failed. They explained that there was NO maintainence worker at the hotel on weekends and both the owner AND the manager were not on site. There was NO ONE AT THE HOTEL with access to the master key. We had planned out time carefully to eat, shower, refuel and return our rental car before we boarded our plane back to NC. Suddenly we were in panic mode as we realized the depth of our problem. It is clear that the owner of this privately owned Best Western, Nadeem, does NOT TRUST his staff as he does not give them access to a master key. We believe this is a liability issue to put hotel guests in possible danger when no one can enter a room. What a baby had been locked in when a mom ran to the ice machine? What if someone was ill in the room? The manager was called to come in and was said to live \"10 minutes away\". He came 50 minutes later and told us \"we did not have anything to worry about\" as he got the master key and simply unlocked the door. Wasn't that easy for him to say? He had not stood outside of the room sweating in exercise clothes worrying if he could shower, pack, clean and gas the car and board the plane in time. How dare he tell us we need not worry! It was the wrong thing to say and I told him so. He should have come immediately to the hotel and then apologized. We told him we did not want to pay for our night and he accepted that. We told him that the staff had been very caring but they were put in a terrible situation having to tell their guests they could not get access to a locked room. Best Westerns are now privately owned and this type of thing is a serious problem as there are no corporate policies which prevent it. We contacted the customer service dept. but they can only speak to Nadeem the owner who made it clear he did not want the staff to have access to the master key \"because it may get lost\" Has he heard of making a duplicate? It would simpler than having a dangerous situation at the hotel. If he does not trust his staff, he should not keep the hotel open. We left 50 minutes late to the airport where we had to run to our gate and we quite stressed after a nice vacation. It could have been so different.

When picked up at the airport by the free shuttle, we were so pleased with the service and the humor our driver displayed. Wonderful trip to the hotel. Check in was a breeze, and the front desk staff was kind and funny. The hotel is quite a maze...got lost twice! The lounge serves a small but good menu, and the woman tending the bar was great. The room was clean, the bed was comfy, dipped a bit to much in the middle, but we were only sleeping for 4 hours so it didnt matter at all. Only complaint, we asked for a 2am wakeup call,....that didnt come! Good thing Hubby has a natural clock in his head. There is also an alarm clock for backup in the room, but every clock seems to be different so setting them can be hit and miss for me. In the morning, our shuttle driver was there, right on time, and confessed that it was he that forgot out wakeup call, he felt very bad about it, gave us a breakfast basket for the road and took us right to the door where we needed to check in at the airport.

Our flight was at 9am and so we figured it was easier to stay near Seatac the night before. The rate was also cheaper than in Seattle city center. I booked on Best Westerns website and paid about $89. for one night.. a Monday night. We arrived at about 3pm at the airport (via cab from downtown because of the flat rate). The shuttle picked us up promptly. We realized as we headed to the hotel that this was the LAST hotel on the Airport hotel strip. We asked the shuttle driver about food for dinner. He pointed out that the hotel restaurant was closed Mondays and that there was only an IHOP within walking distance. Check in was easy with an efficient desk clerk. She asked if we needed a shuttle in morning to airport and we said yes. We had separate flights at 8:40 and 9:00 am. We were told the shuttle runs every half hour on the half hour. We asked for 6:30 for one of us and 7am for the other. The desk person said that the 6:30 was full (They only have one van and it holds 12 people). One of us had to leave at 6am. So if you plan to use the shuttle, this is not the most convenient hotel. I then went to use the pool and spa. The pool was fine (both are indoor) but spa out of order. Next was dinner. I did hear that there was a Safeway nearby and figured we could make sandwiches. It is about \u00c2\u00bc mile walk but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge so that was backup plan. Room was clean and had nice bed and TV with 99 (!) cable channels. The walls can be thin and sound travels. Ask for quiet room. The business center has three PCS and printer that you can use (when others aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t). Breakfast started at 5am that was good and free breakfast had waffles, hardboiled eggs, cereal and bagels plus juice and coffee. I was pleased. So, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give it a pretty good rating if you have a car to go eat and if you want convenient service to airport.
