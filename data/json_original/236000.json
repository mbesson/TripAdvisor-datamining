The location was good. However, Florence is so compact that good location can be said of almost any hotel in the city, so that doesn't count in the Cristina's favor.We had reserved a triple, and the first night none of us could sleep at all. First, the beds were awful -- just worn mattresses on cot platforms. Second, the windows were so warped and rotten that they wouldn't close, so there was no way to keep out the very loud street noise.The next morning, we requested and received a room on the side street rather than the main street. But the problems were the same -- bad beds and windows that wouldn't close. Also, the bathroom was unpleasant. The shower was merely a showerhead in the wall and a drain in the middle of the floor (no curtain or anything), and water spilled out into the bedroom. It was the only time all summer I felt the need to wear my emergency gross shower flip-flops to take a shower. Also, because the bathroom door was so warped from water damage, it wouldn't close. There was no way to be modest in the bathroom; anyone in the room could see in.We definitely would not stay here again. Florence is a spectacular city, and staying in this hotel really damaged our experience.", "Date": "Aug 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR493856984", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ashley627"}, {"Content": "NOT Recommended We stayed at the Hotel Cristina recently, and it was the worst experience of all the places we stayed in Europe. We had a room with a shared bathroom, and it was run down and dirty. There was a floor rug (used to cover the broken and loose tiles on the floor) that was full of sand, dirt and hair. It had never been vacuumed. Why they did not just fix the tiles we could not work out. The towels were a horrible grey colour and like another reviewer stated looked like they had been washed in almost no detergent, as there was makeup stains on them. The bed was uncomfortable, and the furniture had seen better days. it was a collection of old broke 50's furniture. The bedside table still had the previous guests 'rings' from their cups on it! The bathroom was a shocker. It was small, the shower leaked and was generally run down and dirty. It has a window overlooking a courtyard belonging to a private residence. There was no blind on the window, just a flimsy lace curtain, which meant it was totally see-thru when the light was on. As it was a dark dingy bathroom, you could not use the bathroom without the light! The separate WC had probably been renovated in recent years - but like everything else, was in need of a proper clean. A day before we were due to check out the owner demanded a cash payment - we explained we did not want to pay cash, and would settle the bill later with credit card as arranged at the time of booking!. This is exactly what we did. We thought it ironic that they wanted early CASH payment, when they obviously have not spent any money on this run down property in years.The only positive thing going for this hotel was its central location and large room. As Florence is a compact city, a central location is not such a necessity, as most hotels are in easy walking distance to the major attractions. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "May 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR971937989", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "itchyfeetagain"}, {"Content": "Great location but that is about it. We knew this was a budget hotel going into it but the standards in this hotel are certainly not up to snuff. First of all, let me point out the one good thing about this hotel -- its location. It could not be any better. If someone were to invest about $15,000 into this hotel, it would be delightful. As it stands, it currently gives the impression of just barely hanging on.First of all, the entrance area needs some work. It's poorly lit and very dingy. Nothing paint and lightling wouldn't fix. Secondly, when we checked in, the lady at the front desk didn't even show us to our rooms -- she merely handed our room key to her small son whom we followed to our room. He struggled with the lock for about 60 seconds and then gave up, handing me the room key and running away. At first glance, the room looks fine until you sit on the bed and have a flashback -- from sleepover camp! We were horrified to realize that the beds were not beds at all, but metal spring cots with a thin, sofa pullout type mattress on them. We asked some other people at the hotel if their rooms had real beds or cots and they indicated that they were on cots too. The rooms and the hotel itself were generally clean. However, the laundry situation is another story. Our towels smelled awful -- like they had been barely washed in weak detergent and certainly not bleached. We ended up drying our hands on our own clothes and snatched a sheet out of the hallway linen closet to dry our bodies with so that we wouldn't smell sweaty or sour after washing. After the first night, we showered in the morning and used the towels -- until we realized our mistake -- and threw the used towels into the shower area. When we came back from lunch later, we noticed that the same towels we had used and placed in the floor to get new ones had been replaced on the towel hooks for us to reuse -- GROSS! On top of that, it appears after some snooping through an open window that the towels are washed on the premise and then hung on a line in the courtyard to dry, which makes them feel like sandpaper on your body.Lastly, and highly disappointing was the lack of warmth and help from the desk staff -- the hotel appears to be family owned. Simple and direct questions about several restaurants were pooh-poohed due to them not knowing about any restaurant that I mentioned. They kept trying to refer us to a lunch like stand where they sell pizza and sandwiches for dinner --even after I explained we wanted a sit down meal in a restaurant/trattoria. The phones don't let you make outgoing calls in the rooms -- even with a calling card, so you have to use the payphone in the lobby that has at least two keys that only work some of the time. (Plus, no privacy since it's right in front of the desk)After two nights of unbearable street noise from the bar accross the street, until well after midnight and our backs and bodies killing us from sleeping on cots, we were very anxious to leave. I would only recommend this hotel if you were desperate and only had to stay one night.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR564888606", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "willowcrown"}, {"Content": "Nice little hotel I stayed here for 2 nights in July. The ladies who run this small establishment (maybe 10 rooms) were very nice. The room was huge, but the buliding was old, and felt old and dingy. The bathroom was clean, but the shower was a drain in the corner of the bathroom with a curtain. It was a nice hotel, but you had to lug your suitcase up 40-50 steep steps. There is no elevator. The location was fantastic. There were no views, but it was a 7 minute walk to the Duomo. on the south side. i was also close to the uffizi galleria and the river. 5-10 minutes walking. This hote is not luxurious bya ny means. It is what it is: a clean place so sleep and shower.
