The one minor thing I was not happy with was cold showers! It was a hit or miss. I was the first one to have a cold shower and the next day one of my roommates had one too, but not everyone did. Anyway, that was a small problem. Another thing I wasn't very happy with was being on the 6th floor and climbing the stairs all the time since the elevator only held two people with or without luggage and it wasn't very sturdy as it shook the whole way up to the 6th floor. On a more positve note, I was extremely satisfied with the breakfast I had the time I was there. It was very basic and light, which I guess that is how European breakfasts are.

Not the bigger bathroom out there but well refurbished in amenities and towels (changed daily). 2) Good staff both at the reception and breakfast room. Professional and helpful. 3) breakfast room is breathtaking as it is at the top floor with a large terrace that has a awesome view over the roofs and beyond up to the far mountains. Breakfast itself was good with many choises in term of quantity and quality: cereals, cakes, yogurt, fresh fruits, croissant, bread and italian coffee to start the day! 4) free internet corner in the lounge and free WI-FI connection allow you to be on line whenever you need. Ask the kind staff for password. 5) City center is not far. A regular bus service just outside connect you with Piazza Venezia or Coliseum in a while. 6) Good choise of restaurant and caf\u00e8 all around the properties. Also Pizzerias close by. So a positive stay for sure if you ask me. I would suggest to stay here when in Rome.

The hotel website suggests taking the FM 1 from the airport to get there,but we did that and found it very confusing to find our way to the hotel upon getting off the train at that particular stop. No signs at stop as to which way to turn to get to the outlying streets. If you were to arrive at night in the dark , it would be totally terrifying to find yourself there. If I had it to do over again I would take the train to Termini and then the bus to the closest stop to the hotel. Bus #90 that would get you the closest to the hotel. It is easy to get to hotel from that stop,and it is worth the trouble of transferring at Termini train station. There are no shops or restaurants to speak of in that area except for 1 which we did not try. Buses are confusing and take at least 20 minutes to get to centre of Rome.

Good location for #60 or 90 bus into city. Great pizza by the slice place and gelato nearby.

The room was adequate, the bed was pretty comfortable, but the thing that held the shower head up was broken and it never got fixed. There was construction going on somewhere nearby so it was a bit loud, but that was hardly the hotel's fault. I had a room on an inside courtyard so it wasn't as loud as it could have been. I can't speak about the elevator, because being with a large group I just chose to hike my suitcase up the stairs to the 3rd floor, and walk up to the breakfast room every morning. The breakfast was fine, good selection, although the coffee wasn't very good, so I ended up getting an espresso from the little cafe down the block every morning (1 Euro if you get it in a plastic to-go cup). The best thing about this hotel was the location - I actually liked that it was in a real neighborhood away from the centro storico. There was a great local market nearby where we shopped one day (I bought a lovely bit of cheese there), and it was great for my students to see the \"real Rome.\" There was also a great gelato shop (Oasis) down the street, with prices that were much lower, and product much better, than what we found in the center. Also, the hotel is right on the Via Nomentana, which meant that there is a bus that takes you right to Termini Station. On the way is the paleo-Christian church and mausoleum of Santa Costanza. I'd recommend this hotel to a friend only if the friend has no problem hiking up the stairs as the elevator is unreliable.
