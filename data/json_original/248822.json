It can be a little noisy in the evening due to music from nearby establishments, so earplugs are helpful. The people that were running the hotel were very nice. All in all, I would stay here again.

I had such high hopes for Los Itzaes because of the TA reviews. But to our dismay, none of them held true. We were on the third floor - no elevators. So if you have luggage, just plan on this. Tip: travel light so you don't have to lug suitcase up/down 2 flights of stairs with NO air-conditioning. Rooms, bland and stale. Balcony/patio/terrace - non-existent. The french doors lead to a \"balcony\" of about 14\" by 40\". We had the choice to overlook 10th, which was a view of the rooftops across the street, which were covered in old dirty mattresses, tons of old and broken bottles, and a group of guys that were not \"family friendly\" types. So gross. So we settled for our other choice, 2nd floor overlooking the \"courtyard\" which was basically just an empty lot with a few abandoned buildings beyond, harboring some extinct washing machines and other discarded garbage. Such a nice view - not. The rooftop \"pool / jacuzzi\" (there is no pool, just a big cold tub) is freezing cold. I couldn't understand that, seeing now it was baking in the sun all day, every day. ?? The metal doors leading to it scraped against the concrete with a horrific noise. Etc. If you don't want quality, quantity or value - stay here. The A/C was stuck on freezing the first night and we had to argue our case for a 2nd blanket. If I ever I cheap out in Playa again, I will pick a hotel on the beach. This is only two blocks back, but a world away from the charm and feel of the appeal of the area. I didn't even take pics, and I take pics of EVERYTHING. Why bother? I didn't want to remember it. I would never go back, too many nicer properties for the same price on the water or on 5th.

As other reviewers have said, the hotel is centrally located and close to so many places you will want to be. It\u2019s just a short stroll to the bus station, great restaurants, shops, and the beach. The hotel is also a participant in Mamitas Beach Club, which would permit access to the beach if you want to use it. My travel companion and I never did use this service but it\u2019s nice to know it\u2019s there. I was impressed by this property from the start. The lobby is gorgeous! There are vines and plants hanging down from the top of the four floor atrium and it gives the impression of a cool oasis. They have everything from long pothos vines to small palm tress growing in there. It\u2019s marvelous. We arrived late in the day on the 9th and at the reception we were met by Jose who we found to be friendly, welcoming, and helpful. It was nice to see a smiling face after our long trip to arrive there. Our room was beautiful! Soothing shades of green and cream. The floors were marble tiles (be careful not to slip) and the bathroom was entirely marble with a beautiful walk-in shower. The water pressure was strong and a hot shower was reviving after a long trip. There\u2019s a little balcony too with French doors that overlooks a busy street. Despite the traffic, when these doors were closed we could hear no noise. The air conditioner was strong and state of the art. When the balcony doors were opened, the system shuts off so energy is not wasted. Clever! The beds were super-clean and very comfortable. I slept so well! The mattress was new and firm. We really enjoyed the rooftop pool. It\u2019s really takes you away. You can see the ocean from the roof and all of surrounding Playa del Carmen. The pool is chic and stylish and a nice place to retreat to at the end of the day or even for a quick swim before you head out. On our last day we stored our luggage behind the desk and the staff was happy to do this for us. They were all smiles. I would recommend this great hotel to anyone. It\u2019s fresh, modern, and stylish and comes at a great bargain since it\u2019s not on the beach.

And the rooms are clean, and spacious. The bathrooms are sufficiently large, with modern fixtures and a large glass-door shower. The room furniture is tasteful modern, and the king size bed was perfect - not too hard like so many in Mexico. The location is why the hotel is not as expensive as others this nice. It is on 10th avenue (between 6th street and 8th street), which is one block west of 5th avenue (go figure), which is where all of the restaurants, bars and shops are located. The beach is on the other side of 5th avenue, which makes it about two blocks away. Everything is very close and a safe short walk away. The hotel offers free parking in a secure lot directly across the street, and every guest receives a free breakfast of eggs with bacon, or pancakes, or cereal, as you wish. I usually stay in very nice business hotels and this hotel was fine for me.

The staff, managed with great competence by Cynthia Sanchez Sosa, is uniformly pleasant, bi-lingual (at least) and will go out of their way to assist you. A stay comes with a pass to the beach, a beach towel for the day, and a lounge chair rental for free. You may also opt for breakfast included, which is very good and prepared and served very well by Juan Jose, who has been there all three years since I have stayed here if memory serves. I also am fond of the location. It is only three blocks from the beach, but one off 5th Ave., which can be noisy. Moreover, there is a great music bar across the street called \"Captain Dave's\" where Grady and his Fiends (sic...someone crossed out the \"r\" in the sign) hold forth nightly (picture attached).
