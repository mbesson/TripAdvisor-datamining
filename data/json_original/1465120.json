I will start with the rooms: The rooms were very nice looking. The bed was comfortable, and the room was clean. The rooms however were LOUD. I know there was a woman above our room from her high heels pacing back and forth late at night and VERY early in the morning. I could also hear everything that was going on in the room next to me, from a cough to the phone, which sounded like it was in our room. For the listed price, this was definitely not acceptable. Fortunately, we got a good deal on the hotel... The first night upon arrival, the hotel staff was able to book a day trip in Istanbul. This was much appreciated since it was such late notice. While doing this, we had ordered room service for the next morning. The next morning, my neighbors wake up call woke us up. We never received our room service after several phone calls down to the restaurant. Finally we had to cancel because of our day trip. I was extremely impressed when we returned and the manager Onor called us to apologize and we were taken care of for our morning's mix up. The next morning at breakfast, he came up personally to make sure everything was okay. The food in the restaurant was good- The breakfast buffet was VERY pricey. It was a lot more affordable to order straight from the menu. There is also a nice grocery store a few blocks away (Turn right when leaving the hotel doors). Across the street there is a liquor store, and the owner is very friendly. The bar at the hotel was very expensive too. An Effes beer was $9 USD. The bartender was very busy when we were down there around 10. There was a lot of staff but he was the only one who could serve liquor I think.... so we were left waiting awhile before getting service. I found it very odd that the bar didn't accept cash, and the reception desk didn't have change to tip. The internet.... The hotel provides several computers for guest use, however there is NO time limit. My husband went down to try and pick our seats for our flight back home, and all of the computers were taken by teens watching movies! When he brought it up to the reception desk, he was told that they were guests and can't be kicked off. Finally my dad went up and she asked one of the guests to let us on for a few minutes. Thankfully he was kind, and stepped aside- we were only 5 minutes at most. There needs to be some limit on the usage. Every hotel I have ever been to has a pre-set timer when you log in under your room number. All in all, the staff is excellent. They really have a great crew working there. The head waiter/manager for breakfast bent over backwards to make sure everything was perfect. The woman manager at the front desk was very nice, and even asked how our tour was one day. I cannot say enough about them, and how they treated us. On the other hand, the rooms though are surprising, and not worth the money! We didn't have a good night's sleep because it was so loud! We couldn't control our heat/AC and slept with the window open which only increased the noise level. Do not stay here if you are looking to be in central Istanbul. We took a taxi each time to the city, which was somewhere around $10-$15 USD. Somewhat disappointed, but the staff and city made up for it.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cNoisy rooms\u201d", "Author": "David R", "ReviewID": "UR127024028", "Content": "I was woken up by the person above me walking in their room in high heels.

It is far away from historical sites but honestly speaking I do not recommend to stay in the hotels near historical sites.
