I am a travel agent and I have stayed in some incredible places and so not so great ones...Well all I can really say about this place is that the room was pretty big. Yeah thats really the nicest thing I can think of. It needed a deep cleaning really bad, I refused to walk around barefoot. You could see stuff streaked across the floors, and as I would be laying in bed at night, I would get strong sewer smells all around. My bed was no where close to the bathroom. Though it could have been because their was a huge garbage dump behind the hotel. (Just go to the second floor and look back there.At night, just as we were about to fall asleep, the karaoke bar across the street would crank up the music...don't get me wrong, I LOVE karaoke. But it sounded like they were performing in our living room. It scared me awake the first night. I was a little fooled by their main website, they said they were close to the beach and in Kuta..both are false. It was about 10 minutes from the beach and we were no where near the nice area of Kuta. In fact the hotel information listed them in Legian. The area around the hotel was dirty, polluted and didn't feel safe to walk around at night. We took a taxi to the heart of Kuta for dinner and it cost us $40 USD!!! It was insane. SO trust me when I say it isn't in Kuta at all. It's about a 20 minute ride to get where all the action is. The staff at the hotel seemed to always be annoyed if you asked them a question or even if you just smiled and said good morning. The only person who was sweet was the lady working in the restaurant. She was really nice and always greeted us. If it wouldn't have costed me so much, I would have left for home early. I travel all over the place and never once have I wanted to leave before my scheduled time. I would have been happy to just change hotels, but trying to get my money back would have been a nightmare, so we toughed it out.I think if the people would have been a little nicer and the rooms cleaner, and if they were a little more honest about the location, I would have tried to overlook the other stuff.", "Date": "Sep 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR996564412", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "FlipFlops1984"}, {"Content": "Independence Day Holiday 10 of us stayed in Casa Padma for a stress free holiday for 4 days. We had 1 family suite  1 deluxe suite. The family suite was awesome! 2 King Size bed just enough for 8 girls. The Deluxe Suite was nice (renovated). Few things on the Family Suite:-The furniture was worn-out. -The refrigerator needs to be replaced. -Bathroom was in good size, spacious. -Walking closet was great, but needs to extra cleaned, especially the corner area. -The wall needs to be repainted. -The AC was in good condition, just needed to be clean better. -I don't see the pool functioning as a pool, so I wouldn\u9225\u6a9b try to swim in it. The design was simple, contemporary, and modern. It was nice. I couldn't complain for the price! It was worth for your pocket. The location is superb! Close to anywhere.

We had 3 people in our room (a suite meant for 2), and upon arrival the hotel staff brought up a mattress and linens so we all had a place to sleep.The entire hotel is very stylish, and I thought very pretty. We loved the pool in the center of the hotel, and enjoyed relaxing by the pool even in the middle of the night (quietly). This hotel seems like an excellent choice for young singles or families (or older couples, too) - the hotel is peaceful, but on a main road in a more commercial area - there are mini-marts, restaurants, small bars and clothing stores all within walking distance. The beach is about a 5 minute walk.The staff were very friendly and helped us out whenever we needed anything (hiring a driver, asking directions, etc).This hotel is not the Four Seasons, but it's definitely the nicest place I've ever stayed with this kind of rate (a hotel like this in Hawaii would charge you at least $200/night).", "Date": "Jul 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR131006251", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "juror1"}, {"Content": "Crap Reservation and Room Allocation My review for this hotel seems to have disappeared.The hotel made us pay for the full night before we even got our room keys. We were forced to wait 7 hours for our room because someone wanted a room extension till 6pm..and they wouldn't upgrade us to a deluxe room they had available because they were hoping some poor schmuck would turn up looking for a room and would have to pay the full rate.Terrible service, terrible attitude and a hotel that was renovated 2 year's ago but looks so worn down....the website gave us a totally different impression of what the standard room turned out to be (run down).We ended up getting my payment voided, collected our bags, paid for a cab after I spent another hour running around Kuta looking for another hotel to stay at.The front office and resident manager just couldn't be bothered.Sorry, I have absolutely NOTHING good to say about this hotel.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR157608424", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "airbus320"}, {"Content": "A nice treat! This place was nice...after spending my first night in Legian Village in a really dodgy room with a worringly large window that was very flimsy and fairly unsafe I reckon. So I checked straight out in the morning and wandered 50mtrs up the road to Casa Padma, the place seemed clean, modern with a contemporary air and some lovely water features in their restaurant. Lots of black marble and glass and lovely tiling.The staff were friendly and I was showed to my room on the 2nd floor. Again clean, a very good size, and contemporary with a double bed, fridge, tv, aircon and electronic safe. A few minutes later the phone rang and it was the receptionist calling to say I would get a free 15 minute massage every day I stayed there and did I fancy it? Fantastic! And not much to upgrade to the full hours session! After that I flopped into thier beautiful swimming pool and took a good swim. Later that night I ate in the restaurant which was also great and very tasty, although not included in the price of the room, breakfast was however, fully cooked with fresh orange juice fresh fruit and fresh coffee. And the price for all this? 20 squid!!!! Bargain in my opinion would definately go there again.

We stayed at the Superior Suite for 2 nights! Very spacious with living room, separate wardrobe, bathtub with separate shower console. Love the design and contemporary style. Only thing we would have like better is the cleaniness of the room. Although they do clean the room as we would expect, we found the shower wall and bathroom walls to be a bit rundown. And the furniture could be of better quality, although we could not complain, since I think for what we paid, we got more than we bargain for! ha!Hope they upkeep and make the rooms spackling clean!

Was really taken by the website and thought we would spend the last 2 nights of our holiday in a modern hotel. The first sign of any trouble was when we were asked to pay up front for our first night - very strange but we paid. We were then shown to our room which was on the ground floor in a corner. The room was dark and smelt dusky. However it was of a good size and had everything we needed and we decided to stick with it. We couldn't get over the poor workmanship in the room - the bathroom was hilarious with shoddy tiling and groutting and it was as if they'd got a great architect in to design the rooms and then a cheap builder to carry out the work. That evening when I went to have a shower there wsa no hot water. My boyfriend called reception to tell them and they sent someone round who turned all the taps on in the bathroom and then when eventually some hot water appeared he said it was a one off and it was fine. The next morning, the same thing happened - no hot water. I went to reception and the man said he would send someone. We waited and nothing happened. We went to breakfast and sat so we could see our room - no one appeared. Breakfast was the most slow dissappointing service ever and after about 5 mins we made the decision to call it quits. Within 10mins we had packed all our bags and I was at reception telling the man we were checking out, we'd paid in advance and I was in the street hailing a cab. He didn't ask why we were leaving early, show any concern over our dissatisfaction, ask where we were going, offer to help with our bags or anything - only thing he did say was he'd have to check our mini bar to see what we'd drunk! Fortunatley this was entirely unrepresenation of our stay in Bali and everywhere else we went we found the people extremely nice and friendly and helpful. Incidentally his room was 500 rupiah and was the only place we stayed in Bali where the staff did not light a mosquito coil outside our room at night.", "Date": "Jun 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR450708693", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "000Bubbles000"}, {"Content": "Pleasant stay at Casa Padma       pool", "Date": "Mar 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR353675999", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "fairas"}, {"Content": "Feeling Safe....In Bali I have just returned from a week in Bali with my girlfriend, staying at the Bali Padma Hotel in Legian. We left about a week after the recent bombings and thought it was a safe time to go. Even though many tourists decided not to go we felt safe at all times. The security around the padma was unreal. The roadway between hotel and beach is blocked off so there can be no cars parked along there. There is 24 hour security guards walking around and all transport, people and bags are checked personally by security when u enter thru the front gates. No body was upset with this, nor should they be. We walked the streets safely, most dcepartment stores checked every bag when u entered. Same as waterbom park, Bali Hai cruises and all the tourist locations. The restaurants were not busy and most had security at front doors. Kuta Square where the recent bomb went off is still operating and all shops are open, but not busy. So if you are deciding wether to go or not, we hope this helps. We did not feel threatened once. The Balinese people, if u have been there before you will know, are the most wonderful people and so grateful for us going there in recent times. It is still a paradise not to be missed. (The bonus at the moment is having four seats on the flights, cheap shopping and no queues at the tourist locations.)Any questions contact me on ----", "Date": "Oct 19, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR925529864", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "copthat"}, {"Content": "bon rapport qualit\u8305 prix       room 1/3", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR325445982", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "chiffonstole"}, {"Content": "\u6434\u51a6\u20ac\u546b\u4efa\u9287\u693c\u4ee7\u9287\u5a47\u5134\u705e\u5b28\u4efa\u6d63\u5e9d\u5c3d\u93cd\u7b3a\u4eb4\u6984\u546d\u59cf\u951b?#x201d;       \u9287\u5a47\u5134\u705e\u5b28\u4f04\u9289\ue042\u511e\u9289\u70bd\u5058\u95ae\u3125\u578e\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u9287\u5c7b\u4eb1\u9287\ue042\u501e\u6434\u51a6\u500e\u9287\u0441\u4eda", "Date": "Nov 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR954877766", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "keibell"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u3123\u4ef8\u9288\u5099\u7a76\u9352?#x201d;   showReview(20752492, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR285246673", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue0a0\u510d\u9289\u693c\u5137\u9287\ue0a0\u4eb0\u9287\u6b0d\u4eda\u9288?#x201d;   showReview(19915451, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR805976710", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u7455\u6c2d\u5040\u9287\u693c\u4ef8\u9287\u5fcb\u4ee9\u9287\u66d8\u4e9c   showReview(19915234, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR241395107", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u93ac\u6fc4\u4eef\u9287\ufe3a\u4ee7\u6d60\u30e4\u7b02\u9287\u0441\u4ed0\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19911577, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR632127648", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u7ef1\u72b3\u66a4\u9286\u6ebe\u6ad4   showReview(19910933, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR388999492", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\ue15c\u5059\u9289\u7b3a\u5061\u9289\u0441\u5142\u9287\u822c\u4eef\u9287\u00b0\u501e\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(19910634, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR835278656", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d557510-r21172175-Casa_Padma_Hotel_Suites-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "557510", "Price": "$63"}}
