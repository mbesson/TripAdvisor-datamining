The location was just a quick cab ride to old San Juan, but far enough away to be nice and quiet! The pool area is amazing! Beautiful views of old San Juan and the cruise ships. The rooms were clean and comfy. We didn't spend any time in the casino, but it looked large and quite popular. There's a Texas de Brazil restaurant attached to the hotel, which as usual was amazing and so convenient. We ordered a drink from the small bar directly across from the front desk.. Can't remember the name, but it was made with real watermelon... Sooooo yummy! Must try! Lastly, I just want to mention that I booked this hotel through an auction website, and although I noted that there were 3 people in our party, I always like to check to make sure they reserved us a room with 2 beds. I emailed the manager of the hotel and received a very quick and friendly response. I appreciated that!

I am totally impressed with the hotel and staff. Originally I was quoted $239 for one night accommodation - but I was on their website and noticed that if you had a AAA membership or CAA that there was a special price of $149. So I promptly booked the on-line special and cancelled the original booking. Someone mentioned that there was a mexican restaurant across the street from the hotel - I did visit the restaurant (very small) and although I ate there I was not impressed as it was \"fast food\" type meals. After eating at the mexican restaurant I then checked the menu at the Sheraton and would have been happier eating there (the pricing was not much different). The concierge at the hotel was extremely friendly and helpful (wish I could remember his name) He helped me get a taxi for mass on Easter Sunday morning and when I mentioned that I needed to take my luggage with me (I was boarding the Princess cruise ship) he told me that it could be stored at the hotel and that the cruise pier was literally 5 minutes walk. I was quite happy to return to the hotel, collect my luggage and walk to the pier.

The check-in process was quick as there was a special line for gold and platinum members. We were given a room on the top floor (12) for being a gold member but was denied access to the club lounge. This is the first Sheraton that denied me but they told me there were new rules and only platinum members are entitled. Oh well. We rented a car so location is not an issue for us. it was dirt cheap for $20 a day. Driving to the beaches like Condado is literally 5 minutes away. I strongly suggest not to pay $16 a day for parking in the lot since street parking was not that tough. We managed to park near the hotel everytime we came back. Just make sure not to park on streets with yellow lines or the one block designated to valets and you should be fine. There are two blocks between the hotel and the outdoor lot that is free and there is one block in front of the valets and another two blocks by the construction site leading to the highway. You will see it when you get there, If all else fails, the construction site area is a good bet for a spot. Driving southbound will take you to a mall, Plazas Las Americas. Its like any other mall in the USA. Also catch a movie there, a ticket only cost $7.50, what a steal! As for the hotel, it is quite new, opened 2 years ago and everything is in good condition. The pool area is nice except we found locals using it on weekends. I guess nobody really checks ids or keys. It was a little roudy but otherwise the pool is very nice, on the 4th floor with a view. The casino is nice and small but has all the slot machines you need and there is even live music on certain days. Make sure to eat at the Churrascaria (Brazilian BBQ). It is $50 per person but it is all you can eat meat and salad so its not too bad. The service is top notch and the food is tastey, albeit a little salty to some. Overall, I recommend this hotel to anyone. The lobby is lively on all days at all times and everything feels clean and neat. We dont know how public transport is or how good housekeeping is because we opted for the 500 points bonus for not using housekeeping.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with resort amenities close to cruise ship\u201d", "Author": "Ringettechick", "ReviewID": "UR128023647", "Content": "Sheraton Puerto Rico Review This review is from a Platinum Starwood member point of view. We stayed one night before our cruise and one night after our cruise. Some passengers we met on the cruise wanted to stay at the Sheraton and they mentioned it was a two night minimum, which I found strange, so they must have been talking about the other Sheraton in Old San Juan. We booked through www.spg.com. Getting there from airport $18 + $1 per bag, came out to $20 Check In \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was efficient and fast Check Out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We booked on Cash and Points and there was no mention of the $15 resort that came on the receipt under our door so upon check out we questioned that. We were told that the $15 is charged to everyone and it includes internet, pool towels etc, all stuff that already comes complimentary for Platinum members. So they will give you 500 more points for the resort fee, which means you are paying $15 for 500 points. For someone who already has a ton of points, paying for 500 more seemed a waste of money. Platinum members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c try to negotiate your way out of this if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to collect another 500 points. Casino \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only has slot machines Convenience Store \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hotel store has everything you probably need in the lobby with lots of drinks, souvenirs, chips, however wine and beer was a little expensive. I went looking for a Monster Drink (Red Bull) type of drink and there was none of that. So I googled a convenience store and we walked to a \u00e2\u20ac\u015324 Express\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about a 13 minute walk outside over the hill through a littered/almost sketchy area, but safe in the day time. We picked up all of the soda and drinks and wine we would need on the cruise ship for a fraction of the price. Foyer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great vibe in the evening with music and lounge area Room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Well we were seriously upgraded to a 1 bedroom King suite (both times) with 2 bathrooms, so our room was AMAZING! If you want a balcony suite with sunshine ask for Room 1101 - however that room is directly below the Club Lounge patio, so lounge guest can look down onto your balcony. We also had 1001 and since it had a roof, there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much sunshine. Seems like all suites have a great view of the cruise ships and convention centre. Pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c excellent facilities however both times we went down the service table for towels was un-manned and no towels. Frustrating \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you may want to bring your own towels from the bedroom down on busy days. Club Lounge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c beautiful view, HOWEVER \u00e2\u20ac\u201c extremely disappointing food options. As I mentioned we are Platinum, so have experienced a ton of Club Lounges and this by far was the worst! For breakfast, here is all that was available: coffee, tea, juice, red and green apples, muffins, bananas, mini boxes of cereal and bread for making toast. Happy Hour: Hummus with pita triangles (Hummus was gross with no flavour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c really needed some garlic or something added to it), mozzarella squares and cheddar cheese, deep fried local potato type wedges. Alcohol drinks were not complimentary. Soda: Coke, Diet Coke and Sprite. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all. On our last day there upon check out we had planned to get the basic breakfast snacks and go have some cereal before our flight. We went at 8:30am only to find the doors open but no food was displayed. Others in the lounge said no one has been here all morning and there was never any food, so we were waiting for nothing. Very strange and definitely not like the Sheraton. If it was closed or had limited services, there could have posting on the doors to advise. Upon checkout we questioned the SPG desk about the lounge having no food and they said the service person didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show up for their shift and that it was a holiday. The lounge opens at 6:30am, so you would figure by 8:30am there would be a replacement in place or at the bare minimum a sign posted. Getting to Cruise Port: The Front Desk told us the fare would be $7, so we were shocked that the price was double! $14 to go just over 1 kilometre, but most times you would have lots of luggage, so you would want to pay it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s totally possible to walk over in about 20 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 30 minutes. Front desk should update their facts, or ask before you get into the taxi. The taxi driver explained that it was $10 + bags and fuel surcharge. Restaurants at Hotel: Texas De Brazil was attached to the hotel although we never went. There was also a new Mexican restaurant right outside called Ficus and it looked very popular. Getting to Old San Juan: Taxi is $13 One Service Issue: We were enjoying our suite and just wanted to hang out in our robes, so we called room service to bring us some ice. We were told that we have to go down the hall and get it ourselves. What a way to break the romantic snuggles on the couch. We totally would have tipped someone if they brought us ice, but I had to get presentable clothes on and trek down the hall with my ice bucket. Recommendation for the hotel: Add bringing ice to the room as a service . It would be neat if the Sheratons had a shuttle running between them, so you go to from the convention area to Old San Juan area and use both properties.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "abingdon", "Title": "\u201cIts about location and standards\u201d", "Author": "seechel", "ReviewID": "UR127746988", "Content": "OK-- there were good and not so good on this hotel, lets start with not so good.

This hotel is not in walking distance of Old San Juan, but that was not a problem for us at all. We took a 10 minute bus ride into Old San Juan everyday for just 50 cents. The buses run every 15 minutes and until 11pm and the bus stop is right at the corner of the hotel. The drivers and locals were all very helpful with leading us in the right direction. I've read some reviews that complained about the location of this hotel, but if you don't mind public transportation, it's not an issue. Otherwise, the cost of a taxi into Old San Juan is $15. The staff and concierge were all very helpful. They answered all of our questions with no problem. We paid for a balcony room with a view which wasn't worth the extra cost because the entire view was blocked by a gigantic tree. That wasn't an issue either since we spent no time in our room except to sleep. There were also a lot of mosquitos on the balcony. I'm assuming because of the tree. The food was extremely pricey here. We did not eat here at all. We got up every morning and hopped on a bus into Old San Juan and ate there everyday. We had an awesome time. There is a little mexican bar/restaurant called the Ficus directly across the street from the hotel with good food, $6 mojitos, and $5 glasses of Sangria. I ate and drank there 3 times and they stay open pretty late. Outside of that, there are no other places in the area. You'll find that this hotel is cheaper than some others, basically because of the location, but for 50 cents, you can head straight into Old San Juan in 10 mins.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cFamily voted \"Most likely to Return\"\u201d", "Author": "weremovingonup", "ReviewID": "UR127562821", "Content": "Based on the location of the hotel it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely worth having a rental car to get around at your own leisure.

So you feel like you stepped into a nightclub. The rooms are plenty quiet and very comfortable, so young kid would have no issue with sleep. Food is overpriced but all these hotels tend to follow that strategy. If you don't have a rental car, that could be an issue. The hotel is located in area of San Juan that seems detached from the city. Old San Juan is good 15 minute drive away and some of the other 'hang out' destinations like Condado Beach are also not within walking distance. We had a rental car, so we were able to get out and go to different neighborhoods. Though will say parking and driving in San Juan is not for the meek. Locals don't cut you any slack. The workout facility is very nice and everything is new! There is a Resort fee of $15 a day. Again this is a common practice among larger hotels, but in this case you are actually getting a nice facility to use. My wife did forget her iPhone at the gym and surprisingly a staff member picked it up and held it for her and until she could return to recover it. What a relief that was!! Speaking of the staff, everyone we came in contact with was very helpful and pleasant. Definitely adds to the positive experience. They have a parking garage across street that cost $15 a day to park. You can go in and out if you choose to. Not inexpensive, but not horrible either. Overall, we had a very positive stay here! Would absolutely consider staying here again. Though would compare to a place in Old San Juan or Condado Beach as there are more options to get out and eat, sight-see without the use of a car or taxi. So it's a really nice hotel that requires a car or taxi to get around.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Albany, Indiana, USA", "Title": "\u201cFirst night here!!\u201d", "Author": "Lori P", "ReviewID": "UR126729566", "Content": "Last night was our first night at the Sheraton Puerto Rico Hotel & Casino and I have to say; so far it has met and exceeded our expectations.

No gripes there, that's part of it. As for the other comment about the beaches being three minutes by car!?! What car were you driving? It was at least a $15 cab ride no matter where you want to go from this hotel. The ONLY thing to do on this side of the island is play in that casino. While we were there, the hotel had a LARGE private party in the main bar at the front entrance that could be heard in our room upstairs. Two days later it was closed for remodeling, so I never got to see it. We had decided to spend the day at the pool on a Monday morning, and they decided to drain the infinity pool! When I asked when it would be open again, it wouldn't be until the day after we left that it would be open. The food in the resturant on the first floor was lack lustre, at best, and that was breakfast. How do you make a lack lustre breakfast? That's the easiest meal of the day to cook. We tried eating in the Texas De Brazil resturant in the hotel. We have one at home and thought that it would be great to eat there too. Boy, were we wrong. The food was VERY salty and the service was not near what we had come to expect from the same resturant chain. The food variety and the salad bar were very much not the same and not near as plentiful. Our next trip is coming up this year and we have already made reservations at the hotel in Old San Juan, where EVERYTHING is located.

I would suggest a room well removed from the elevators if you are a light sleeper as neighbors returning from the casino or nightclubs can be loud. This gap also lets in a good bit of light, which when combined with all the electronics can make the room seem well lit in the middle of the night, even with the light blocking curtains drawn.

Now, let's get to all the reasons why this hotel is just WRONG! First, the hotel says its 4 stars. ALL 4 star hotels in Puerto Rico are on the beach. THIS one is not!!! Plus, they don't even have free shuttle to/from the beach. The pool closes at 800pm Sunday-Thursday and at 1000pm on Friday and Saturday. WHY would you do that if you don't have a beach??? At least let people enjoy the pool whenever they want, especially those coming back LATE from conventions!! The hotel is NOT close to anything if you don't know the area. Everything that is close you either won't be able to find or depending on the day/time may take you up to an hour to get there since San Juan/Condado traffic can get really nasty especially on nights/weekends. Last but not least and probably what turned me off the most!! I extended and paid for an later check-out because I was working and had gone to bed late the night before. Since I couldn't stay in the room after 1pm, I went downstairs and while I was checking out told the front desk clerk that I wanted to use their business center so I could work until the end of the day. He said absolutely not, because since I checked out I wouldn't be \"allowed\"on their computers. When I mentioned I had a laptop, he said I wouldn't be able to connect because they couldn't give me a password!! This is probably one of the most outrageous things I've ever heard from a hotel.

They offered an upgrade to a nicer room but given that we are only here for one night and specifically wanted to see San Juan it was kind of pointless.

I fail to understand why they cannot offer a shuttle to the other Sheraton which would have made ours and from the reviews many others stays' more tolerable.

Old San Juan is across the harbor ($15 cab ride each way: $16 per day if you self-park your own car) and there is nothing (really, nothing) of interest within walking distance of the hotel.

Part of the new Convention Center complex, which already seems to be experiencing some economic hiccups, that has interrupted complex completion. A multi-story unfinished steel building skeleton sits in front of the hotel, & the retail complex that sits on the 1st floor of the adjoining parking garage appears to be totally vacant. It is several dark vacant blocks to anywhere even remotely close to the hotel, which I would not wander through at night. The hotel itself is the typical big convention center design, with a very unimpressive casino adjoining the lobby. The rooms are still new & welcoming, but I am shocked that a totally new hotel, built from the ground up, would contain bathrooms so small that they had to install sliding doors, because regular doors could not be used.They planned a new hotel this way? If 2 people try to use the room, 1 will have to step into the bathtub. The rooms are furnished very nicely, & the hotel isn't bad, but it does not meet the quality levels of similar Sheraton Hotels. And, unfortunately, service levels, or the lack thereof, are all over the place. All of the staff we encountered were polite, courteous & wanted to help, so I can't fault them. It just seems that factual training is non-existent at the property. Not a single employee we asked a question of, had an answer or seemed to be knowledgeable. To say service was horrible in both the lobby bar & restaurant would be to give a compliment. Left the lobby bar after sitting for 15+ minutes & never seeing a single employee enter the area --- at 4:30PM on a Saturday. Was seated by the hostess in the lobby restaurant & abandoned. No one ever appeared to take our order, even though there were, maybe, only 3 other tables occupied at 12:00 noon on a Sunday. And probably the most pitiful Sunday Brunch Buffet I have ever seen at a hotel of this claimed-quality. Finally returned to the hostess stand & asked if anyone was going to wait on us? She apologized & disappeared never to be seen again, so I went to the kitchen door & asked 1 of the 2 waiters standing there if 1 of them could wait on us. Polite, courteous & apologetic, just seemingly clueless & untrained. Management (???) seems to be totally non-existent in this facility. The surrounding grounds are lovely & inviting.

The room had the same amenities of other Sheraton properties. I ordered room service for a late night snack. The food was hot and delicious. It was delivered promptly. The hotel has an incredible infinity pool. We swam at night and had a very nice view. The water was warm and clean. There is also a large hot tub which was wonderful to soak in. We enjoyed talking with other guests. There is a casino located in the hotel. We played a little and broke even. If you gamble they will bring you complementary cocktails and sandwiches. The next morning we sat at the bar before checking in for the cruise. The bartender was wonderful. He went out of his way to find a football game for us to watch.

The lobby, elevators and halls were full of drunk girls in overstuffed bikinis, guys who reeked of beer, sweat and marijuana, and general mayhem. Because the party was being held at the pool, we were told our children were not permitted to swim; and so we were confined to our dirty little room. There is very little around the hotel, so we ordered room service for the kids. It took two hours for it to arrive: overpriced, undercooked, cold pizza, the front desk explained it away by saying that they were having trouble finding someone to bring it to the room since all of their employees were waiting on the local drunks at the pool.

We took the bus (quick and cheap) but there were plenty of taxis as the hotel is right across from the new convention center. The rooms were nice, however, the view from one side of the building is great...pool...cruise ships...and the other gives you a view of Condando (not so nice...the view, not the town). So I would request a pool side room if you want a nice view. The pool area is nice...not huge, but big enough to take a dip and cool down. There is a bar/snack area which is very reasonable. The area was crowded, but there were places to sit and lounge, just not in the shade if you needed it...you had to get down early for that. Also, there was a fountain area that kids can play in (my 1 year old LOVED it). To be clear, you can't 'swim' here but it is deep enough to get your whole body wet and there are ledges for kids as well. The best part of the hotel is the service. The people working there were great...very helpful and courteous.

They took our cell phone number and said they would call us when ready. We took a taxi for a $15 to Old San Juan, which was about a 10 minute drive or so. We found a restaurant for lunch pretty quickly and while we were eating had a call that the room was ready. Since we didn't want to have go back and forth by Taxi too often, due to the cost we decided to explore Old San Juan for a while before going back. When we were done later in the afternoon, we took a taxi back for another $15 or so. We collected our luggage which the hotel had stored for us and proceeded to the room. We were on one of the higher floor and it took a few seconds to figure out that you had to swipe your room key in the elevator for it to work. The room was a nice size with a king size bed that was very comfortable. The furnishes and decor were nice while not being anything fancy. There was a coffee maker and ironing board we appreciated. The bathroom was stocked well with soaps,shampoo, conditioner and lotions, which is more than what was on the cruise. The shower was very nice. For dinner we decided to walk to a Sizzler restaurant that we had notice while passing by in the taxi earlier. I was surprise to find out that we didn't see others walking there. The restaurant was ok and was reasonable. It was a busy place with mostly locals. The only other place to eat that we saw was the restaurant at the hotel. After dinner we walked back to the hotel to try out the pool. The water was very cold, so we went in the hot tub instead. There was a bar next to the pool, which was located on one of the upper floors with a nice view of the convention center and the fountain below. That night there was an outdoor fashion show at the center, which we could see from the pool. Check out was smooth the next morning as all we had to do was turn in our key. We had breakfast at the buffet in the hotel, which was a little expensive but very good. The hotel store our luggage so we could go and tour the Bacardi Factory. The hotel had tour which included the Factory, but it was cheaper to go there by taxi. The taxis are always easy to get right outside the hotel. After the tour we called back the same drive to pick us up. We collected our luggage pretty quickly and got another taxi to take us the port. Each taxi ride cost us about $15- $25.

As an SPG Platinum I was upgraded to the 12th floor which is the club level. They have a lounge but it is not open on the weekends or after breakfast on Friday. This was disappointing but I guess they don't have much business on that level on the weekends. The lounge when it was open served breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres. Alcoholic drinks were extra but tea, coffee, juice, soda etc were free. The selection for breakfast was a simple continental spread. The evening spread was limited but had a few hot dishes and various vegetables for dipping. I ate lunch at the hotel twice, once at the pool where it was naturally quite expensive but it was quite good. Lunch inside was a similar menu but not much cheaper so would recommend the pool bar. Biggest issue I experienced with the hotel was with the slow service by the front desk. It seems they were understaffed with usually only 1 staff person and that caused a lot of delays. The other problem which might have been a computer issue was not recognizing SPG status even after reminding them of this. It required my logging into my SPG account to show the Platinum status as they couldnt see the status in their system. All in all a good hotel in an area that is in the process of being redeveloped.

At first I was excited because I read it was right across the street from the pier and it is. As I sat by the infinity pool I could see the cruise ships. Unfortunately it's still a $15 cab ride over there because of the street design its difficult to walk safely. As for the hotel we checked in around 4pm and went up to our room. The room looks exactly like the pictures. We then went outside to try to catch the bus to Condado. For some reason every bus that came said they were not going to Condado even though that's what was written on the bus sign. So, many potential bus riders just sat in confusion for quite awhile. After about 45 minutes we gave up and decided to take a cab. Condado is about 2 miles away just over the bridge by the HIlton and that was a $15 cab ride. We got some food and then came back to the hotel. I must re-iterate there is nothing around this hotel. Do not stay here if its your first time in Puerto Rico because it will not give you a good feel of what the island is like. Instead you should stay at the Shearaton in Old San Juan so you can be near any and everything as well as experience true Puerto Rico and you won't have to take a cab to find food. After returning from Condado there wasn't much else to do so we just went to bed. My only pet peeve with the room is elevator noise. We weren't even anywhere near the elevator but all night long as it moved up and down it sounded like there was construction going on. It was pretty annoying. For breakfast the next morning we decided to eat downstairs in the restaurant instead of paying $30 to get a cab to eat in town. We had about a 50 minute wait since there aren't any other restaurants in the area every hotel guest comes downstairs to eat. You will spend a minimum of $20 for one person for breakfast if you get a single item and some juice. Your better off spending $25/pp to get the buffet because juice is also included.

It was very easy to get a taxi the next morning to Old San Luis, and the hotel stored our luggage until we returned to pick it up in the afternoon.

However, if a mistake is made promises are made that are NOT kept. They will tell you anything to make you leave the front desk to try to get others checked in quickly but the follow through is horrible. They do not get back in touch with you. We had misc charges on our bill that we caught only because we asked to see the folio ahead of time. We did this because the check in took over 4 hours and because we had to catch a plane we wanted to make sure check out went smoothly. It would not have if we had not spent an hour of our time the day before checking the folio and having them remove misc charges. The area around the hotel is NOT developed. They show pictures of shops and eateries but these are really all empty. The \"CLUB\" in the hotel does not exist. There is no dancing. The specials advertised never take place, $20 for all you can drink champagne if you're a lady, don't count on it. The sushi bar we never saw open once. If it is advertised or promised to you don't expect it. I feel bad because the staff works so hard and is so friendly but the management does not keep their word. This hotel stays up because of the convention center, the friendly staff and their contract with the cruise lines. Do NOT stay here if you can help it. It will not meet your expectations. If you're a business traveler it's fine but if you're planning an event or a wedding beware. They will say anything to get you to book. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I was fooled once and will NEVER go back and stay here again. I will try to get every person I know to NEVER stay here. I would rather pay more to stay somewhere where integrity and honesty mean something. I have stayed at several Sheratons and this is by far the most up set I've ever been after having stayed somewhere. It is a nice hotel, a nice spa, a nice staff. It's too bad that the upper management don't have a conscience. Don't say one thing and do another. Once trust is broken it is nearly impossible to get back. Although I know this was a specific location it made me doubt the Sheraton brand in general. It just goes to show that hiring the right people can make or break a business. Sometimes a trusted name like Sheraton can keep a location open based on the trust and reputation that other Sheratons have worked hard to build.

The view of the cruise boats and Old San Juan was great and the infinity pool was very sharp. Everyone loved it. There was plenty of shade and even several private cabanas available. We got lunch from the pool bar/ restaurant area and were very happy with the food and service, excellent choices and better than expected food quality and price. A great start. The rooms are very modern in decor and look very trendy and chic. There is plenty of room and the furniture is very good quality. A Sony flat panel TV? I was impressed.

The menu was diverse, the food was of great quality and the drinks were excellent.

We got a good rate via our AARP membership, costing an average of $150.00 per night incl. of tax (25%). The size of the rooms and bathrooms was good (as compared to a boutique Bread & Breakfast Inn, we checked out in a more touristy area of Condado), clean and typical of such chain hotels. Its appointments, carpeting, ambience etc. were dull. Beds and pillows were too soft. No fridge or microwave in the room. Breakfast menu prices were high. This hotel is located near the Convention Center. There is no life near by within walking distance. Although it boasts of the largest casino in town, it is very small by Vegas standards with tightly spaced arcade like slot machinesand only a few blackjack or other gambling choices. Rate of return was not posted. The hotel is truly in the middle of nowhere if you do not have a car (parking is $$), other than the next door Convention Center. The area of Condado (~3 miles away, across the bay where cruise ships park) is more modern, tourist friendly with a busy night life and lots of restaurants. It is a better area to stay. Condado is $12 by taxi fron this Sheraton or 50 cents by bus (~ every 20 minutes outside of Sheraton, bus service stops after 9:00 PM). Accessing the interesting city of Old San Juan is also same price by taxi or bus (on same bus route and frequency). For value conscious, we recommend staying in Condado area and visitng old San Juan by bus during the day and sticking around in Condado after 8:30 PM. Cruise ships dump lots of tourists in the area every day in peak seasons. You have a good possibility of negotiating favorable rates with smaller, private inns and hotels even in peak season. We recommend visitng, Fort El Morro, St Christobal and walk in Old San Juan on your own steam. No need of guided tours ($53.000 pp) - which in our opinion, offer diminished returns to your $. We felt that the National Park service does an outstanding job for our tax$ and in providing information enthusiastically (frequent orientation talks for free). Ticket is $5.00 for 1 week pass for both forts - an exceptional value! The trolleys in Old San Juan are free - hop on hop off, though irregular in schedule. All beaches are free. We paid ~$75.00 pp by guided tour and van transportation to El Yunque Rain Forest (preserved and serviced by National forest service) and Loquilo Beach. it could have been as easily done by renting a car locally (free parking & admission at El Yunque and Loquilo Beach). At night, you can drive off to the Luminiscent biobay and rent Kayak yourself (save the cost of guided tour ~100.00 pp). (We did not get to do this bit unfortunately), One must visit the National El Yunque rain forest. The Federal Govt. does excellent job here for the tax $.

Traffic was horrendous with many roads blocked off, presumably because it was St.Sebastian Day weekend, the equivalent in P.R. to New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. In checking into the hotel we noticed groups of teenage girls congregated in the lobby. They appeared to be between 16 and 18 years old, max. The only restaurant open for the evening was Choices. It provided a varied menu of Puerto Rican specialties and traditional favorites. They even prepared a grilled checken breast on spinach for my mom, to conform with her low salt diet. The bill was high but the food was good. Our rooms were minimalist modern and new. The hotel was isolated in a business park that was obviously unfinished, with ivy growing over the half built structures. This meant that there was no where to walk, nothing around the hotel. That was ok, we all needed to go to sleep. Wrong. The teenage girls multiplied into a loud, raucous party under our windows on the 7th floor, that kept all 5 of us awake until 5:30 am. They were obviously drinking, playing loud music, and shrieking. Occasionally it would die down, and then the shrieks would return. As we were checking out my brotherinlaw, a very mild mannered person normally, complained forcefully. He was right. The hotel has to decide whether it wants local, disruptive, underage parties, or upscale cruise industry customers. We spent well over $1000 for one night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lodging and dinner. I took up the cause and mentioned that my 90 year old mom had been one of those affected. The front desk offered a 50 per cent discount, but the rooms were prepaid.

We checked in with no problems, less than 5 minutes and the lobby was very crowded. Too funny, I was even slightly scolded for trying to take our bag cart to the elevators to drop them off in the room, he said leave them and we did just that. The hotel is modern, clean and has a nice atmosphere, it is not traditional Spanish, but quite contemporary. If you want that old world feel go to the crowded Old Town or one of the out of city hotels!! We had a drink at the stylish bar before heading to our rooms, yes, the drinks are $15 each, and we had a bad martini the first go round, but we simply told the bartender we did not like it and he made a new one which was very good.... not sure what others expect, drink prices in any popular tourist destination like San Juan are not cheap. We headed up to our rooms, our bags were there, and no extra fee or bell person waiting for a tip either... The room was quite nice, all the ammenities needed and a few extras like an ipod station and Starbucks coffee. The room was very clean, comfortable, large and had an easy to use safe for your valuables. The view was overlooking the island airport and the 5 ships in port for the Sunday embarkation. I have zero negative to say about the accommodations. We did not use the pool so I can not comment on the open or close times, although it is a beautiful pool and pool area, even for being a convention center hotel this was a nice way to make you feel more tropical.

We left our bags in the area where they check them for guests checking out but wanting to see the city, their was no fee for this and they were guarded by a bellman and we simply gave a modest tip, but no hassell or pressure.

You must take a bus or taxi for 20 minutes to get to Old San Juan or Isla Verde. 4) Surcharges and service fees for everything and charged to your room. 5) Expensive food and drinks, not worthy of their high prices. $15 for drinks and $25 dollars for simple breakfast in the morning. 6) Staff couldn't keep up with busy time periods or when cruise clients arrived for the nights. Had to wait long periods to eat or be helped because couldn't keep up with crowds. 7) There is NO CLUB LOUNGE on the 12th floor. No difference between VIP 12th floor and the remaining floors.

The staff were friendly enough but clearly were unable to cope with this, resulting in us waiting around 30 minutes on 2 occasions just to get a table. The room, although very pleasant is not great in terms of sound insulation, and we had two disturbed nights out of three due to outside noise from the hotel- pack your earplugs!! We also were advised on our second stay that we would not be able to use the pool area after 4pm, because of a private function. Although this may have been a one off, and we were just unlucky we did feel that the large convention bookings were viewed as more valuable than individual guests. The elevators are also wholly inadequate for the hotel, particularly as the pool, gym and meeting rooms are not at ground level, so the wait for an elevator can be prolonged during peak times.

We stayed 5 nights at the San Juan Sheraton Hotel and Casino for a conference that my wife was attending during the last week of September. Overall our experience was positive and we were satisfied with the quality of the room and of the services. We had a room with view on the convention center/bay area on the 5th floor. I do have a big comment about the price we paid since I felt a little bit like IT WAS BAIT AND SWITCH. According to the reservation confirmation Email they sent us, we were expecting to pay around $155/nights (room + 11% occupancy tax included (the conference group rate), there was no mention of any other fees or taxes. In fact we paid in the final bill $139 for the room (no breakfast included at that rate), $15.29 for taxes, $15.29 for hotel service fee, $1 tips room attendant, $5 tips Bellman the first day (despite the fact we gave tips to these person on our own accord not knowing they would be tipped from the bill). That end up being a bigger rate than announced with no early disclosure. Another thing is some people at the conference booked their room calling the hotel but not mentioning they were there for the conference and got a rate of $99 a night including breakfast for 2. I am sure they got the same kind of fees hike at their checkout too but they started with a lower base fee. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll imagine that when they have a group rate it should be a better deal than the anybody rate ,no? Next time we go to a conference, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll call directly to check the rates of the hotel before using the conference rate\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 A note for people with kids, we were able to rent a mini fridge for $25/night from the hotel and also they sell milk per the liter packs at the gift store. Other note about parking, we were there during the fashion week at the convention center and it did not look like it would have been easy to park a car on the street during these days (just in reference to other reviews about parking at this hotel, you might want to check the schedule of the convention center\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) I also saw in one of the review that kids eat free\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I am not so sure about this since we had to pay for our 2 year old meal (breakfast, lunch or dinner) The hotel looks pretty new and other reviews said it opened in Nov 09. It is located next to the convention center and has a good number of rooms. I guess it is a good place to stay if you go to a convention there. According to my wife, the conference rooms at the hotel are fine (very cold though), but their break accommodations were not too good (food was OK, the coffee was available only at the earliest break in the morning and not at the other breaks). The problem with being located next to the convention center is that the convention center is not in old San Juan. So if you are only coming to do tourism, well you may want to look somewhere else or not complain about taking a mean of transportation to go to Old San Juan. The #21B bus (you have to work with their schedule, but they were clean, safe and relatively fast) is $75cts to go to Old San Juan each way or the Taxi are about $15 with tip each way. The difference is the convenience of the Taxi. We used a combination of both. It is true that around the hotel there is not too much to do. We tried the beaches (very kid friendly) about 20 minute walk from the hotel, but will not really recommend it. First the walk there is along a very busy road and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really feel safe (and the sidewalks are not in too good shape so it made it difficult with a stroller). Then it might be the day we were there, but there was some kind of gangs there and they started to fist fight in front of everybody, cops started to come but waited to be numerous enough to do anything. My 2 year old was done with that place, and did not want to go back to the beach\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 A word about the elevators. There were 5 of them but only 4 worked and at times when the hotel is busy it was pretty slow traffic ( it had took us more than 10 minutes to go from the lobby to our room at times) The Pools on the 4th floor were nice. Like other review said it consists of an infinity pool overlooking the bay and a kid pool sharing water with the whirlpool area. The whirlpool water wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too hot, about body temperature but it made the kids pool water at a nice temperature (warmer than the infinity pool water) for the young kids. There was also an area with some water fountains were kids can play. Around the pools there was a lot of lounge chairs and lot of room to relax. On a Sunday afternoon though there was a DJ that was palying some loud electronic music all afternoon. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that relaxing and there were no towels available at the pool even if we called the lobby multiple time, we had to use our room towels that day. But it might have been just a one day thing linked to the fashion convention since there was also a DJ on the Friday and Saturday nights in the lobby playing the same kind of electronic music very loud up to at least 2 in the morning. We could hear the music from our room on the 5th floor. The good side of this was that there were very good looking people at all these parties\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to come back to the pools, there is a bar and grill next to the pools. We ate some decent bar food there, and tried some drinks that were good and priced at price comparable with what we had in other hotels of that class. My big issue with the pool is that it closes at 8:00 pm and there is not even access to the area around the pool after that time. I thought it would be nice to go there to read or relax at night and I would suggest the hotel management that even if they close the pools they should let the bar and the area open up to 10:00 pm to be accommodating with their guest looking for some evening relaxation. We ate at the Choices restaurant in the lobby a few times (a lot to do with the lack of other choices for food places in that area) and were very satisfied with the quality of the food and of the service every time. Prices were a little high but not outrageously and I will say comparable to other hotel of that class. The staff at the restaurant was really accommodating for us and our 2 year old. They all were also very helpful. Couple times we ordered our food to go and they called us when it was ready so we just had to go pick it up downstairs. It was convenient with our toddler that can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seat for more than 30 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We usually do not like to eat too many times in the same place but we had to here, again not because of the hotel but of its location. Even if it is called choices after 5 days we had pretty much tried everything on the menu or at least it all sounded the same\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. They had a Sunday brunch for about $25 per person, it was good, but the selection of food item was a little disappointing. The Casino was extremely clean, and non smoker, we did spend a little bit of money there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. They had live music and also the waitressing staff does little dancing once in a while\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 In front of the convention center there is a cool water fountain. It is not the Bellagio, but the fountains works with the music, it was a nice show. We could even see it (without the music though) from our room. We did take a tour proposed by the concierge to El Yunke (the rain forest). It was a half day for about $55 per person (free for our toddler). It was fine but next time I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll rent a car and go by ourselves at our own rhythm. I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get to see more stuff and do more little hikes.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cBest place to stay in Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "HDelrio", "ReviewID": "UR80531933", "Content": "The Sheraton Puerto Rico at the Convention Center District is the place to be when in PR, it's minutes away from Old San Juan and Condado.

Incompetent Management.\u201d", "Author": "kt127", "ReviewID": "UR73982378", "Content": "I stayed here for two nights. I saw that the hotel was fairly new (<1year) and from the pictures on the hotel web site the hotel looked great. There is no \"customer service\" at this hotel. I interacted with the management several times and they never were able to address the problems I had. For starters, the hotel charges a 14% \"Hotel Service Fee\". Not a \"resort fee\" of $10 or $15 per day, but a % fee. So the higher your room rate, the higher your fee. And what does the fee get you? Well, one thing it gets you is a \"daily English language newspaper\". That is, unless it's a Sunday....I was told my the manager that \"sometimes we don't get Sunday papers in Puerto Rico\". Really? Then sometimes you shouldn't charge every guest a service fee for something you are going to deliver. You also may not get your daily paper on Mondays (as in my case), because \"it's a hoilday weekend, so there is no paper today\". Don't be fooled, this fee is nothing more than a hidden room rate increase. Why can't the hotel just set the per-night rate appropriately, instead of adding on such an obviously bogus fee??? I am in Starwood's Preferred Guest program as a Platinum member (>25 stays per year), so I stay in a lot of hotels. As a Platinum member I am supposed to get a room upgrade (\"best available at check-in\") and access to the club lounge and terrace (on the top floor). I was really looking forward to using the club lounge, because it looked really nice on the web site and it's a nice perk - breakfast, snacks and drinks throughout the day, hors d'oeuvres in the evening, as advertised on the hotel web site. Well guess what? They had to close the lounge in this 8-month old hotel for repairs. At least that's what I was told the first time. After seeing a group of people on the top floor lounge (from the pool area), I inquired again about the lounge and then I was told \"the lounge is booked for a private event\". Huh? I thought it was closed for repairs. When I checked out, I again mentioned this to the manager and expressed my displeasure that the lounge was currently being advertised as a perk on their web site, yet I was first told it was closed for repairs and then told it was booked for a private event. Then I get story # 3 - the lounge is closed for the season due to low occupancy, and was booked during my stay for a private event. Low occupancy? I was told by the bellman on the way out that the hotel had been nearly 100% occupied for the last 3 days. 3 stories, not sure any of them are true. And the elevators. There are 5 elevators. You have to take the elevator to get to the pool, which is on the 4th floor. With high occupancy, the wait for an elevator was anywhere from 5-10 minutes. One of the elevators must not have been working, I never saw the door open during my entire stay. That leaves 4 working elevators to use, right? Wrong. It seems when the \"private party\" booked the lounge, the hotel decided that the private party guests shouldn't have to wait for elevators like the \"common\" guests of the hotel - so they reserved one of the elevators exclusively for the private party!! How ridiculous is that, make the guests in the other 500 rooms wait even longer so the private party doesn't have to wait to use the elevator. I used each restaurant in the hotel. The food was fine, nothing spectacular, but not bad. However the prices are ridiculous, you'd think you were in NYC. Which is unfortunate because there is NOTHING within walking distance of the hotel. You will definitely need a car (or be prepared to use Taxi's) to do ANYTHING outside of the hotel. My \"upgraded room\" was a room on the 5th floor (of 12) overlooking the parking garage. Nice. :( The phone in my room did not work. I had to call the front desk on my cell phone and they sent a techie up, who did get the phone working after about 10 minutes. Overall the stay was a huge disappointment. I complained via email and made inquiries to the manager, and have not yet received a response to my questions. (over 3 weeks). Customer service at this hotel is non-existant. Nothing seems to matter, except swiping your credit card, charging outrageous prices for par service (at best), and completely ignoring concerns of the guests. Even without having status in their \"preferred guest club\" I think the treatment I received was inexcusable. My stay here was a huge disappointment, and I'll never stay at this hotel again. This property could be a great experience if the owners got rid of all the current management, did away with ridiculous 14% fees for nothing, and focussed on treating their guests like guests. A good start would be to respond to emails from guests.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "munich", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay at this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "stefi1970", "ReviewID": "UR73613269", "Content": "The hotel is brand new, but has a \"too modern\" style that does not really fit with the fact you are in a Caraibic Island.

The closet is particularly small, but has an iron an iron board - if you suceed to get them out from the closet! The bathroom is as well disappointing for a such new hotel: small, impersonal, cheap quality stuff (plastic top around the sink!!). The only great thing was the bed, as per sheraton standard: extremely confortable, lots of pillow and soft duvet. Other amenities offered for free: a useful safe box, starbucks coffee, a couple of bottled water per day and cable internet connection. BUT there was NOT fridge or minibar in the room, which seemed to us very odd, especially considering that in Puerto Rico the weather is pretty hot all over the year and it would be nice to have a cool drink without calling room service all the time!!! The laundry service is simply awful: we sent some shirts and did not get them back after TWO days, so we called the reception and they told us thet our laundry was ready but they did NOT have ANYONE who can deliver it to our room and the only way in which we can get it was to go down and pick it up by ourself; so I did, I went downstairs and waited 20 minutes on line in the lobby, just to be told that they could not locate our laundry at the moment and that we should wait for have it delivered in room the nexy day!!! (eventually, we get the laundry the following day, but NOBODY from the management even say to us a word for excusing the bad service, and they charged us the full amount even after 3 days!!!). Another negative things is the location: you are in a beautiful caraibic island and all you see from the hotel is an ugly marina and the huge convention center just in fron of the hotel. Even from the \"panoramic\" pool, the view is quite depressing... The pool and sunbathing area is really disappointing: very crowded, small pool, bad views, bad service at the pool bar. We stayed at the hotel from a tuesday, when the hotel was pretty quite, to a sunday: during the weekend the hotel filled up with a lot of low-level big noisy families (probably attracted by weekend discounted rates) and everything, from the service level to the atmosphere, became even worse. The bar and restaurants can go if you need a quick bite, even overpriced, but for a real meal we strongly suggest to take a taxi and go to old San Juan, where you can also enjoy a walk and great shopping, which is not possible around the hotel.

Hotel itself is very nice and well appointed but overall suffers from being by itself in the middle of nowhere. Unless you are attending the convention center, or just using it as a base of operations (as we did) you will not find this hotel to your satisfaction. Good points: As mentioned, hotel is very well appointend and beautiful. The infinity pool in the 4th floor is very nice and there are quite a few places where to eat in the hotel. Rooms were large and comfortably appointed. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help you once they understood what you wanted. The Bad points: Room Care - There seems to be a problem with consistency by the room staff. Not one of the 5 days service to the room produced the same results, and there was something missing every day. I resorted to leaving notes in spanish requesting specifics (which we would get), but other items (for example hand towels, shampoo) would be missing. Not of the items by itself that was severely major, but definitely an annoyance item each day. Food Prices - Only way to describe them is ridiculous. A breakfast consisting of an omelette for my girlfriend, oat meal for me and 2 cups of coffee and 2 glasses of Juice was $46.00 BEFORE tips and tax. We lucked out that we had breakfast vouchers, but still had to pay almost $10 since the vouchers did not cover the cost of the breakfast. Noise - We had two nights where we had to contact the front desk to send security to get roudy neighbors quieted down. The problem with this is that in one case it took almost an hour and a half for the front desk to send someone to check in to the matter. Also, there was a BBQ contest next to the hotel that was broadcasting very loud music, so the competition between the BBQ contest music and the hotel music made it pretty hard to figure out what you were listening to.

The view at night over old San Juan was beautiful. The Casino was beautiful and had lots of machines and tables.

BUT only rent a car if you can deal with aggressive DRIVING.......It's like New York! The streets of Old San Juan are very narrow and crowded! Use the parking garage in the city ......it is very cheap Second, the hotel check in and out was a little slow.....they needed more attendants to move guests in and out faster. Old San Juan was wonderful, I would recommend Mallorca's for breakfast (reasonably priced), El Hamburger for lunch (reasonable, miniature hamburgers were wonderful), Raices (Roots) for Dinner (reasonable as well, traditional Puerto Rican food). We ate at some different spots, but these were my favorite. The history this city is remarkable.

Moreover, I spent hours over a period of two weeks on the phone with various personnel, including hours that should have been spent at the conference where I was presenting a paper. On top of all this, the hotel itself was not even up to par: dirty coffee grinds in the coffee maker in our room upon arrival; nobody answering phones, including room service (in fact, my colleagues and I had to walk downstairs to the front desk to place an order for room service, because there was no one to take our call); no ink in the business center printers; et cetera. But these little nuisances paled in comparison to the disaster with billing and accounting. I have actually had to cancel my ATM card and open a new card with a different number for my own security, to prevent further unauthorized activity by the Sheraton PR. I have strongly urged the University of Puerto Rico (which cosponsored the conference) not to use the Sheraton for any future professional meetings, and I will certainly spread the word among my colleagues at other universities throughout the United States.

The hotel is well designed with a nice lobby, bar and restaurant on the main level- along with a casino. The 4th level has a roof deck with pool, cabanas, hot tub, etc. - all very nice. The biggest complaint I have is about the location. I like to go for a run in the morning and it was difficult to get anywhere nice to run. I had to either cross the freeway or go through some not-so-nice parts of town. The front desk didn't have a walking map or any suggestions on where to run.

The facility of the hotel is beautiful. Very well done and open. Very clean. The front desk staff was nice, not over friendly, but nice enough. The staff outside was super friendly and helpful, and got cabs for us immediately when we needed them. We were given two good restaurant suggestions before we went into Old San Juan. Our room was large and the design is great. Beautiful bed and chair in the room. The Bliss bath products were a plus for me who adores Bliss. Samuel, the bartender in the main lobby lounge was fantastic! He made great drinks, was super friendly, and we had a lovely conversation with him about different local foods and things to do. Valentine's night, there was also a very talented singer performing, and we really enjoyed listening to her. Those are the good things; here are the bad: The dream bed... it not a dream. It felt like a basic, hotel grade mattress. Nothing special at all. But the BIGGEST problem with the room is that there are only sheers over the majority of the window space- which means that you are woken up with the sun blazing into your room the second the sun is up. That is NOT good.... and reason enough that I would never stay here again. The location of the hotel isn't great. It's between the beach areas and Old San Juan... which means you can't walk to anything and whether you go to the beach or to OSJ, you're going to pay $30 round trip cab fare. We spent the day roaming around El Morro and Old San Juan and were tired enough that we decided to just head back to the hotel to have dinner... big mistake. The Choices restaurant on site was having a Valentine's deal, and I think you could order off the regular menu as well... but either way, we weren't interested. The menu was small and uninteresting. And had nothing on there that was any type of Puerto Rican food- disappointing. The food in the lounge was more a tapas type menu, and not really what we were looking for either. We were looking for a nice gourmet style Puerto Rican meal or seafood of some type, but after asking the front desk for suggestions close by and getting none, we gave up and ended up ordering delivery pizza b/c by that point we were just tired and hungry... we saw the delivery guy in the lobby about 6 or 7 times while we were waiting on ours to arrive, so obviously, more than just us had the same issue. For breakfast the next morning, we were hoping to be able to order food and eat outside by the pool (which was beautiful), but the pool side cafe wasn't opened (it closed early the night before as well... and the pool closed at 8- super early in my opinion) We ended up eating the Choices breakfast buffet for $19 each... it was your typical overpriced hotel buffet. Not bad at all, but not worth $40 for the two of us either. Check out was painless. They do put a $100 hold on your card for things like, breakfast and the bar, etc, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine, but the employee who checked me in would not have told me this except that I asked him why he needed to run my card when I had pre-paid for the stay. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem with them putting a hold on my account\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but I do have a problem with them not telling me this up front.

We could have stayed somewhere else for much cheaper\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and not had to spend $100 in cab fares\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and it would have been really, really nice to be able to sleep in on a getaway weekend and not be woken up with the sun.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ml_812", "ReviewID": "UR55522514", "Content": "We stayed for one night in December before a cruise.

EVERYONE was happy to be there and happy to help us. We were there for ten days over Christmas and had a wonderful time. Personally, I loved the location. We were close to Old San Juan, Condado and highways so we could get up and go. We felt like we had won a prize--a brand new hotel with people who were happy to help us and it wasn't swamped with tourists. The hotel is beautiful. The pool area is relaxing and laid out wonderfully. We previously stayed in a hotel with a very similar layout in Curacoa (Marriott) last year. They both have pools above the ground level which makes for interesting views. This pool area far outshines the one in Curacao--larger with more room for privacy. The only negative regarding the pool area is that whatever kind of lounge chairs they bought they are quickly mildewing. The gym is AMAZING! Everything is new, there was ALWAYS availability and there were diagrams on the walls describing different exercises. The only downfalls were that the spa was not open and there was only one restaurant open. Also, the pay-per-view movies program was not yet up and running so we devised our own setup using our laptop. This is to be expected for a new hotel. I'm sure these things will be functional soon.
