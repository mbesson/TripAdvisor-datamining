{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very nice The Unisplendour hotel was conveniently located for my business needs. The property was clean and seemed to be well managed. The recently renovated rooms were quite comfortable and offered in-room high speed internet for a modest daily fee. The decor is modern, but with a touch of Chinese influence in the design. Air conditioning worked well and was much appreciated as it was quite warm in Beijing when we were there.Breakfasts were included in the room rate and they featured both western and Chinese cuisine. The lounge/restaurant was reasonably priced and a nice place to relax.The location on the NW side of Beijing made a trip to the Great Wall at Badaling easy to do in a day. The hotel will provide drivers for the day to take you to the Great Wall and Ming Tombs for about 800 RMB. It was about a 35-45 RMB taxi ride to downtown Beijing, including the Forbidden City/Tiananmen Square area, depending on traffic.Given the amenities and convenience, I found the Unisplendour to be a great value by western standards.", "Date": "Aug 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR372327095", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "seguerr"}, {"Content": "Two weeks in Beijing The Unisplendour had been closed for renovations and they were running a bit behind schedule. We were the first guests and somethings in the lobby were still being completed. It looks like it will be gorgeous when it is completed. The rooms had been completely renovated and were very nice. Flat screen TV(only two channels in English, though), large mirror, and a nice shower. Like many hotels in China, you must have your room card inserted into a slot for the electricity to work. When you leave the room and remove your card the lights and air conditioner turn off. Because we like coming back to a cool room we found that you can insert a business card or something else into the slot and it will have the same effect as the room card. The maids will remove this though, so you have to do it after they clean your room for the day. The location is good, right by Tsinghua University and a block from a shopping center with a large grocery store on the second and third flood. There is also a McDonalds and an excellent Italian Restaurant called Cafe Bros (the fruit juice is fresh squeezed, strawberry is excellent!)near the shopping center. The front desk spoke some English. One bad thing was that you had to pay for internet, it was a couple US dollars a day. Also, many taxi drivers did not know where the hotel was, even when we gave them the hotel card with the address. Ask the front desk or a Chinese friend to write Tsinghua east gate on the card to help the taxi drivers. The breakfast is good and it changes every day. Many of the items are not traditional breakfast items, but something Americans would have for dinner.", "Date": "Jul 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR609661913", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ningningbug"}, {"Content": "chufa The hotel was booked by an organization which invited my husband to give a lecture on architecture at the Tsinghua University. The location is great for our purpose because it is only 5 minutes walking distance to the unversity. It is quite far away ( 40 min. by taxi) from the downtown Beijing area. The taxi ride to downtown costed us about 50RMB.The lobby entrance is typical for a Chinese 3-4 stars hotel. Standard double/twin room is spacious (approx. 25 sq meter) but the condition is quite old and worn out. There are small spots on the old carpeting. The side edges of the bathtub needs to be redone (black) and the fixtures are a little rusty. In general the room needs to be refurbished and maintained. The service is very good. People working in the hotel are very friendly and genuine but their English is not sufficient therefore a lot of small mistakes made because of the miscommunication. The buffet breakfast has a combination of eastern and western food. The food is good but not great!In genreal we have still enjoyed our stay mostly because of the friendly atmosphere and the convenient location next to the unversity.", "Date": "Dec 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR268973472", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "chufa"}, {"Content": "Convenient to TsingHua University The UnisCenter Unisplendour is a western business hotel very close toboth TsingHua University and Beijing University (Peking University).
