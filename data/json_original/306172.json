This was a business trip and mainly chose Fraser due to its top class reputation in the service apartments sector. Spacious apartments with well done rooms. The staff and house keeping were very warm and welcoming and always ready to help. When compared with the other service apartments in the area, Fraser turns out to be slightly expensive, more because of its newly renovated swimming pool and gym area. Decent spread for the breakfast buffet and free daily shuttle services to Orchard Road and other shopping malls. One disadvantage is that they dont have a Memembership Program like most other hotels and are neither affliated with Starwood or similar programs. Needless to say that this would deter me from coming back to them. Ideal place for families and individuals who prefer to cook. The management also organizes events on a monthly basis - such as Singapore Zoo Visit, Bird Park Visit etc at very reasonable prices (cheaper than what you would pay at the ticket counter) and even includes pick-up and drop to the hotel. It is also conveniently located, within 10 minutes by cab from the CBD and Orchard Road areas.

Given that this was 4X what these suites generally cost I expected a spacious room and comfortable bed. When we walked in upon arrival we both burst out laughing. It was smaller than the hotel room we'd previously had downtown. The bed we affectionately referred to as \"the plank.\" The kitchen is pretty average for Singapore. Rage top, sketchy convection oven/microwave combo and poor quality pots and utensils. I did note they used Wedgewood for the tea service. The furniture was an odd mish mash of Ikea, and faux Perkanan/Victorian. There was no dinner table, but then again who cooks here? It's Singapore. The pool area of beautiful, the gym is quite nice and all the staff were professional. We took advantage of the shuttle service and sometimes did the free breakfast downstairs. Compared to the Fraser Place location (where our friends were stationed at the same time) this location is really family oriented. There's nothing much to do within walking distance and we soon tired of the few local restaurants. As a wife staying here with a husband working I'd have preferred to be in the Fraser Place location as this was a bit too isolating.

We took the children to the play zone at least twice a day. It is large, clean, and very well maintained. There is also an outdoor area with plenty of toys and an old sc hool video game room, which was great. The other highlight is the service. The staff at the front desk and housekeeping were great; but the cafe staff were exceptional. This is in a wonderful central location. It is connected to a mall with a Cold Storage grocery store and a Starbucks. Extremely convenient. Fraser runs many free private bus shuttles throughout the day -- to the business district morning/evening and to major shopping areas all day. We stayed in a two bedroom suite that had recently been updated. It was very modern, very nice. I am not sure that all of the rooms are renovated. I recommend you inquire about this when booking.

The River Valley location is part of Valley Point Shopping Center. I have stayed with Frasers on numerous occasions for extended periods of time. They are a 'service apartment' hotel (for extended stays) and really don't court the nightly or a couple of nights market. This is also the tropics, so there are geckos (harmless, frightened lizards that eat insects) at times on the walls or ceilings (depending on your luck). The old-fashioned furniture mentioned in other reviews is the Peranakan style, or Straits Chinese (and Malay) style, which is being phased out for ultra-modern chrome and glass decor, sadly. It's a shame people come with such ignorances. Bottom line: the place is super clean, quiet, and with a ultra-friendly staff that will bend over backwards for you. The location is ideal for just about anything in Singapore and free transportation to major areas is provided. Five bus lines run outside the front door and cheap taxis are plentiful.

So if you're staying for any length of time bring extra pans coz they provide only 2 small stove top pots & no frying pans or colander (buying them at the local supermarket is mega bucks). Only the 3 bedroom appt has an oven, the 2 bed only a stove top. Local restaurants are so so & very expensive...lots of microwaved foods sold at wine bars for example. My biggest problem with this locale is that it shares the same block as a night club, so on Wednesday we were woken up at 11:30pm by extremely loud Acid House music & even louder DJ; all the windows closed & despite being on the 5th floor we could still feel the shock waves rattling the bathroom windows & floors!! I have yet to experience Thursday night, but expect more of the same. Friday thru Sun there was a live band outside in the square below our window which played till 10pm & our 3 & 5 year olds couldn't hear the tv in front of us on full volume. The only evenings that were peaceful were Monday & Tuesday. The only nights our kids got to sleep undisturbed & by 8pm were Monday & Tuesday. This is not the place to stay if you are visiting Singapore on Medical Tourism, have had an operation (as in our case) & are waiting out the week post op for the docs consultation. It is hell to stay here with the noise & disturbance if you have young kids & need peace & quiet to recoup after surgery. Staff are nice, pool so so (could see nicer outdoor facilities at neighboring hotels from our window), can't say how breakfast was as we ate in our suite.

We joined him on his nearly two week business trip, with our two small children (3 yrs and 1 yrs). The free Singapre Zoo family pass we got to use was also great value: my kids (and we too) enjoyed the new water feature and spent most of time there keeping cool. The Suites staff were very patient with our kids, even in their cafe when my toddler had moments of extreme energy. We loved the size of the apartments (although I wuld have preferred a computer to have been provided in the 2-bedroom units just like in the one-bedroom ones - and I think they should provide internet service just like in the Kids Zone and their Library), where we didn't feel our kids were a problem to other guests and they could enjoy the comforts of home (high chair and baby crib provided, even a bed guard rail if my toddler needed it!). The cafe was a mostly miss for their weekday breakfasts (Mondays were the best, I thought; and bring your backpack and stow away some kiddy yogurts to put in your fridge for quick snacks later). The in-hotel spa was disappointing too (VERY hard sell when all you just want is a chance to relax; I liked their facial, although it wasn't clear from the description that that is all I would be really getting - free foot spa was really just dunking your feet in one of those home-style foot spa auto baths, and then getting a very quick hand rub of your toes), The kids' swimming pool was great - and during the weekdays mornings when we went to the pool, the jacuzzi pool was never used and was an ideal pool for the kids to splash in and swim around. Loads of floaty toys provided and a cute Little Tykes type water slide too. The indoor play Kids Zone was ok, but my toddler lost interest quickly in it, and if there were older kids about, the place was often in a huge mess with big kids bolting about. The Housekeeping staff were very kind and they often did double duty by offering baby sitting services when they are off cleaning duty (Ru was great - she spoke clear English and understood our toddler without batting an eye lash). The outdoor playground on the same level as the play zone, was often water logged (fake grassy turf over old concrete), but my kids liked the swings there. There is a nice playground in the condo complex next to the Suites that you can easy walk to and that has shade (mornings are best, as it's cooler and more kids are about). There's also a good hawker place for local food and cheep prices down by the river and across from Great World City Mall. As part of the Suites building, there's a Cold Storage grocery store, which was really convenient. And I liked my hair cut at the hair salon as part of that mall, and the breakfast was good at little cafe that serves Kaya Toast breakfast.

During that time we stayed in three different apartments -- each one bigger than the last -- as we needed space first for our mother-in-law and then for relatives and the baby. Because we work and live in Asia, this wasn't our first extended stay in Singapore but it was our first time with Fraser. We definitely plan to return. Here are the things we liked: -- Kidstuff: the huge, well-stocked indoor playground/play room for kids was a hit with our three year old. (we checked out several places and this was by far the best kids area we could find.) -- Outdoor areas: the swimming pool/barbecue area is well designed so that there are both semi-private areas and places to hang out an meet your neighbors. The kids pool is separate from the adult pool, meaning I could swim laps without having to dodge children. -- Service: service was efficient and very pleasant. My wife liked our maid so much that she asked if she could continue servicing our apartment even after we moved to a completely different floor. -- Convenience: a small shopping mall with a grocery store (and an excellent Italian restaurant) is attached to the apartment building. We loved being able to run out to the grocery store and be back in the apartment in less than 10 minutes. -- Shuttle service: the apartment runs a couple of shuttles throughout the day to most of the prime shopping and tourist destinations (orchard road and Suntec). Taking the shuttle was usually more convenient and easier than taking a taxi. -- Internet service: our room came with free, extremely speedy, internet service. I don't know if other rooms have that or not. The things we didn't like so much: -- Breakfast: Fraser has free breakfast during the week. It appeared popular, but the menu didn't really suit my family. -- Location: the apartment isn't located near a subway stop so you have to take the shuttle or a taxi if you plan to ride it. The area is also quite residential, so you have to take a taxi to go to the main shopping and eating districts. -- Ovens: my wife and I love to cook. The ovens are complex and not intuitive. I don't know how many batches of cookies we ruined before we figured out how to use them properly. You can see a few pictures of the apartment (and the new baby) at www.samsphotoshelf.blogspot.com.
