A most enjoyable stay. I recommend trying local restaurants more off the 'tourist trail' & central piazza's, we found some absolte gems at great value for money, although the language barrier was a struggle at times, we managed! I loved the 'Jewish' quarter on the other side of the river from the hotel, a more 'genuine' experience here, and again chose the 'local' cafe bars & eateries, very authentic & reasonable! One word of warning, when you arrive at Rome airport be very cautious with regards to the taxi's, we had an unfortunate experience on arrival where we just jumped into a taxi at the 'rank' but were over-charged at \u20ac80 and the driver wouldn't take us all the way to the door of the Hotel due to some minor road works at the top of the narrow street where the St George is! We argued a little but the driver got quite aggresive so we threw \u20ac70 at him, told him that was all he was getting & walked the 5 minutes to the hotel. On the way back to the airport we arranged our taxi through the Hotel reception & paid only \u20ac55.

The staff were extremely friendly - and helped us prepare for the surprise. We spend a great long weekend in Roma (pay the Roman's some respect and call it Roma, not Rome...). The hotel was indeed comfortable and cozy- but the highlight was its location: Via Giulia is a real gem with the original dark stones still in place since 1508 and some houses from the same period still exist. The Hotel is in walking distance from the Piazza Navona and the Pantheon - and therefore all the cool places within the narrow streets - all the way to the delicious restaurants in the Jewish Ghetto. The hotel is also near the river, and upon 10 min. walk and across the river is the Trastevere with very lively scene. But location takes its toll... Via Giulia is very close to the river and at any hour you could detect if the 130 Kph that just passed was a Moto Guzzi or a Ducati and you can hear every bus or fiat that passes. We were on the 4h floor, and every time we opened the one of the big windows, fresh air came in with lots of noise. Breakfast was good, though surprisingly for Roma - the coffee was made from an automatic machine, so we skipped the coffee there and went a block up via Giulia to a local coffee- that really takes pride of their wonderful coffee. Don't expect a real GYM when you go down to get rid of some pasta calories or a hang-over, though the warm big whirlpool is nice during the winter evenings. One Caveat - at the price we paid, you'd expect the entertainment at the room: TV Channels, Music, Movies - to come free or at a very low price. But they charge you like hell for every little song you play. Good thing they have working free Wifi internet - so when needed we went on watching Craig Ferguson on youtube on the iPad They say that the quality of your domicile in Roma is based mainly on how far you are from the local farmer's market.

Their are no cabs waiting outside and so a reasonable walk along cobbled (and therefore not ideal for the elderly or women in heels) streets is the only option.....but when in Rome walk! (just look out for the pickpockets of which many including us have a story to tell) Main complaint relates to the roof top bar- which looks fantastic on the website and at which we were hoping to kickstart the aforementioned anniversary celebrations......on making our way there on the Saturday evening we discovered it was closed for a private function and as it is always closed on Sunday's we had to forgo what should have been a memorable experience....quite why nobody at check in or concierge services bothered mentioning this is beyond us.

(at least in our room) Ok - breakfast was a simple buffet affair with a range of food, good for a couple of days but after 3 its very tired and we noted that some of the cakes and pastries did not change over that time Bad - atmosphere is totally lacking. No one is ever in the bar, cigar room, or the restaurant - prices for the mini bar, laundry are very high, and as usual in Italy there is no chance to iron anything yourself - heating system is as other reviewers noted, its set centrally. although you have an individual control it doesnt actually have any affect on temps, so in winter it was very warm and we needed to intermittently open the window.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Times for Vacationing Couple\u201d", "Author": "rbfam", "ReviewID": "UR121945248", "Content": "We travel a lot and are pretty picky, so trust me with this recommendation.

I found this hotel and managed to get the best price through lastminute.com with 20% off in their sale. (i found www.hotelscombined.com best for shaving the price off places since this sale has now finished.) I also downloaded the voucher from tripadviser to get free internet there. The location is amazing, the staff very friendly and helpful and the spa great for the end of a day of sightseeing. The standard room is a little small for the money and only had a shower, but as our movie channel didnt work (Warning: 12 euros per movie) we were upgraded to a superior which is a much better size if you afford it and are staying longer than two nights i would definitely upgrade. We ate at the restaurant as www.diningcity.com reviewers gave it 9.7 out of 10 and it is in the Michelin guide. The staff were very good the cocktails were amazing but on the whole the meal was very overpriced, its came to 130 euros for 2 champagne cocktails, 2 steak dinners and 1 dessert. The spa is small but very nice after a long days walking, again though i think the treatments are overpriced and there is no couples treatments available as the two treatment rooms are small however the staff down in the spa are very welcoming. - If youre looking for a romantic spa day for two, i suggest you book the couples day at Parco de prinicpi north villa Borgese (http://www.princespa.com/modulo_pacchetti_eng/25200_1_DAY_COUPLE_PACKAGES.htm?id_sezione=30131 but do check that their pool is working as we cancelled when we found it was under maintenance.) The hotel is central for everything, the Vatican, Campo dei fiori and Piazza Navona are all about about 10 mins walk away but the street the hotel is on is quiet. The hotel is not pretentious and the atmosphere relaxing, if you want pure luxury head to via Veneto (Majestic hotel is worth going for the restaurant alone...best ever!!!) if you want a nice hotel and sightseeing is your aim and youre curving your budget but still want upmarket then i recommend here. Have a great trip and here are a few tips: Sunday brunch: Hassler hotel top of spanish steps 54 euros for champagne all you can eat 5 star buffet and coffees with a view over all of Rome in one of the most prestigious hotels. For a special dinner with famous chef beautiful food in incredible surroundings go to http://www.filippolamantia.com/ out of this world. (150 euros for 2 people starter 4 glass of wine, mains and 1 dessert.) Rome is very romantic, if you plan to propose here there is a Tiffany's near the Spanish steps but its very small, but horsedrawn carridges and the restaurants above would all be amazing settings. Lastly, Rome is the capital of fashion but the cobbles are not filled in, walking in heels will take you forever and i nearly broke mine several times, may i suggest evening ballerina shoes and flat boots for sightseeing ladies.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cAwesome, great hotel!\u201d", "Author": "jtpuck", "ReviewID": "UR121100593", "Content": "Great hotel across the river from the Vatican.

The room was very comfortable and clean and the hidden gem is the spa in the basement with its gorgeous heated pool, sauna and steam room.

There is no wifi in the rooms and if you don't get a delux room you even have to pay to use it in the lobby. The spa is not always staffed, I saw one guest walk in on someone having a massage trying to find where to get a towel from. The one time I saw a staff member she walked into the spa and shouted at everyone to turn off one of the communal showers someone had left on! Again when i asked the receptionist Jonathan about staff in the spa he said I could call one on the telephone in my room if I needed to speak to one. The rooms are described on the website as soundproofed which is a total lie. The doors have heavy locks on them that require you to slam them shut to lock them.

However, the main highway runs perpendicular to the hotel and if you are in a standard room in the middle of the hallway, it sounds like a freeway outside your window 24/7.

Unfortunately, we were up most of the night with the traffic - horns, and all. It was absolutely awful. The room was really small too. The hotel bills itself as a 5 star, but no 5 star would offer rooms like this. I checked Trip Advisor and was shocked that no one had mentioned this. There were posts about how quiet Via Guilia is - which it is - but none about the highway noise. I complained to the front desk the next morning and they told us they could upgrade us to a junior suite for a small fee. We were ready to check out and forfeit our payment, so the discounted upgrade was a deal for us. Our new room was wonderful - quiet, large - perfect. It was on the Via Giulia side of the hotel. After our first night I would not have recommended this hotel to anyone, but as long as you pay up for at least a deluxe room and specify that you want a room on Via Giulia, it's an ideal location with a great breakfast and some great perks.

Make no mistake, officially on the website it's referred to as a Roman bath or Turkish bath but this was simply a hydromassage pool measuring approximately 5m square. Not big enough to swim properly but enough for a relaxing dip. You can walk everywhere in Rome and for us, the combination of the late autumn heat and achey feet, the pool was a welcome addition. The spa also offers a wide range of treatments and they get booked quickly so plan ahead if you feel like some time out. The hotel is located in the historic centre but in a quiet part of the city near the river. We found it to be well located for the Vatican City, Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, Campo di Fiori, via Condotti, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain... you get the idea! Rome is a city that is best enjoyed on foot - there is history everywhere you look. For those who love shopping, sadly Rome doesn't quite compare with Milan or even Florence. Obviously there are the high end luxury stores and a handful of interesting independent stores but not much in between. As for eating out, there is plenty to choose from. Beware the tourist traps but for us we particularly enjoyed the restaurants and the atmosphere in the Trastevere district. This was an easy 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. On our last day the hotel kindly organised a taxi to take us to Ciampino Airport. We were assured that we not be over-charged (as I was on a previous visit to Rome) because the fare of 50 euros is capped. However when we were in the car, our driver informed us that we would have to pay another 5 euros for parking! On arrival near the airport the driver claimed that the car was having problems and dropped us outside the airport perimeter on the busy main road!! Then he had the audacity to charge us the additional 5 euros for parking despite being nowhere near the departures terminal. With a flight to catch and no time to argue, we simply paid and ran to the terminal. If you organise a taxi drop off just make sure you this doesn't happen to you! An unfortunate end to our lovely stay in Rome and the St.George. This incident aside, the St.George is a great place to stay and I would be happy to stay here again.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, smart hotel in Rome\u201d", "Author": "JamesA045", "ReviewID": "UR119317172", "Content": "I stayed at the St George Hotel in Rome this week for work.

I don't think any of the other hotels we looked at had a pool or anything so was pleased that we found this one. The room was really nice. A few reviews we read had said that the rooms were a bit small. We had a room in the roof (5th floor) and it was pretty big. The bed was huge! Although the bathroom was pretty small this wasn't a problem. The room we booked said it came with a shower. As we wanted a bath we put a message on the booking asking to have a bath if possible and the room we were given had one. We had free wifi in our room too. The breakfast was great - plenty of choice from fruit, cereal, cold meat & cheese to a basic fry-up and tons of different cakes and pastries. The staff were very friendly and happy to help - they booked the Borghesi museum for us. They all spoke English too. Another review we had read said that it was in a very noisy location. As a result we went armed with ear plugs. If you are a very light sleeper you may hear a bit of traffic but we didn't really hear much other than the torrential thunderstorm that woke us one night!

To do so, however, they will have to improve service somewhat. Some of the amenities have genuine kinks; motion-sensor lights in the walk-in closet and the front hall of our suite had a funny way of popping on and off at odd hours all by themselves. While we were delighted by our room and the environs, we did experience some peculiar lapses by the hotel staff. On the first morning of our stay, we were awakened by loud pounding; apparently, the suite next to ours was under construction, and we were never warned about possible noise. When we complained, the apology given by the concierge was more dismissive than heart-felt, and we weren't offered any reparation. We were told upon check-in that we would receive a fresh fruit basket daily; instead--by the third day of our stay--the wan peach and the wayward pear in our room had turned to mold-covered mush, and were not replenished. Room service glass and tableware weren't routinely removed by maid service during daily clean-up, and our used washcloths were spirited away but never replaced. When we inquired about gay night-spots at the front desk, the attendant seemed a bit stunned, bless her heart; not the most sophisticated response at a five-star hotel with an international and diverse clientele. At the spa, the Masseur urged us to enjoy the large marble jacuzzi, and--when we attempted to do so--he sheepishly announced that it was out of order. Finally--in the interest of full disclosure--when I made our reservation via the internet, I mistakenly reserved two suites instead of one, and when we arrived and attempted to correct the original error, we were charged the full penalty instead. (In fairness, the hotel was merely following its only expressly-stated policy, and can't really be blamed. But we were staying a full five nights and utilizing the hotel's restaurant, spa and bar, so one wishes in a moment of clemency they'd decided not to so stringently enforce the rules!) But the positives? The breakfast buffet was varied and scrumptious, and the wait staff was attentive and brisk. The bed was insanely comfortable, with a soft, deep pillow and buttery linens.

We had planned our last 3 nights at the St. George before our departure. From the outside, the hotel looks like nothing more than another apartment building on a cobblestone street in an upscale area of the city. However, upon entering, it is clear why Conde Nast recently gave the hotel high marks. The hotel is very trendy, well appointed and located away from the masses of tourists. However, the day time crew at the front desk, espcially, Landini, could use some lessons in customer service. His attitude most times was arrogant. But then again, almost every resident of Rome we encountered had an attitude and were very unaccomodating. After we checked in, we were escorted to our room which was a junior suite. We had no complaints about the accomodations except that the beds were extremely hard and since we faced the front of the hotel, we could hear cars and people talking outside. Of course all of the hotels in Rome are overpriced. When we asked for additional sets of towels so that we could shower at night and in the morning as well, the housekeeping staff questioned our need for more than one set. We found this inquisition to be offensive. The breakfast was adequate, but was really designed for European tastes. Personally, we don't like to eat scrambled eggs that are more appropriate for drinking out of a cup than eating off of a plate. Unfortunately, Europeans don't seem to know how to cook eggs. However, the Cappacino was delicious each morning and it was very pleasant eating breakfast in the courtyard. We only had an opportunity to use the spa once, but it was absolutely delightful and relaxing after a long day of walking miles throughout the city. The hotel is within walking distance of the vatican, although we would suggest booking a tour in advance. As we were walking to meet our tour, we passed a line that was no less than a mile long. It was great to walk right up to the front door of the vatican and walk in. We booked our tour through the vatican website and were quite pleased with it as it was about 2 hours in duration and gave us a sufficient overview and included a visit to the awe inspiring Sistine Chapel. Since the St. George is not near the tourist hot spots such as the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps, we were able to sample the local flavor of the City. The restaurants nearby the hotel are plentiful and host many local residents as their patrons. Accordingly, dining takes on a whole different meaning. Generally speaking, the food in Rome was inferior to that which we enjoyed in Florence and in the Sorrento/Amalfi Coast area. The hotel is also within a 30-35 minute walk of most parts of the city. We enjoyed walking, but on those occasions when we were tired, we took a taxi ride which was not that badly priced. Don't forget to stop for gelatto at Giaolotti near the Pantheon. Lastly, we took Rome Cabs to the airport. The driver was 15 minutes late although we got there on time.

The breakfast at the hotel was adequate although the coffee deserves a special mention as it was fantastic. There was a small selection of hot food to complement the continental breakfast. We made it into the spa on our last evening and this is very nice with a small heated pool, gym & sauna. We did not dine in the hotel restaurant preferring to sample the ambience of the areas surrounding the Piazza Navone. I would recommend this approach to travellers but beware the service in Rome is generally terrible. Getting a table & being served can seem like a trial in itself. The exception to this was a meal taken at a swanky restaurant called II Convivo where the service was excellent: however so it should be for the price! Rome itself is a fabulous city with incredible sites & I would recommend it to anyone. But I would also say that it is also the most \"touristy\" city I have ever seen. The sites literally crawl with tourists & some areas like the Vatican have 2 hour queues to rival Disneyworld!! In summary the hotel was nice but I did not feel it really lives up to it's 5 star billing. The little snags need to be sorted out at this price point", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florence", "Title": "\u201cVery poor service, if you drive, reserve a parking or...\u201d", "Author": "antti78", "ReviewID": "UR7654458", "Content": "I think that the beautiful building itself and the prices should not guarantee five stars. The main characteristic of five stars is the immaculate service, a hotel staff that would satisfy every guest's needs. This hotel is not the case. Straight from our arrival we asked where was the parking of the hotel, the answer is that it was full and we should have booked. Unfortunately nobody told us, even on the website it only says that you have to pay for the parking, but it doesn't tell you you have to reserve it. The terrible Front Office manager told us to go look for a parking spot in the streets nearby, with an attitude of arrogance and no interest at all. He was also fast to point out that one of the rooms was not ready cause we got there before two pm. Fair enough, we went to eat. The restaurant is fancy, was almost empty, 4 people serving. We sat down and ordered fixed menus, which is basically a meal all in a plate. It took them 1 hr and a half. The director was there with guests, ordered similar things, he sat after us and finished in 30 mins. The staff at breakfast is not trained at all, fits well in a three stars. At 3 pm the room was not ready yet, they kept repeating 10 mins. No apologies whatsoever from the man who so hastly pointed out that check-in time is from two pm. We were two couples and a room was ready, but the luggage had not been taken up yet, despite having been around already two hours. Very efficient indeed... Luckily in the afternoon the FO manager was not there, and we got some good info and smiles from Orietta and Jonathan at the front desk. Remember the parking? I think a 5 star in the centre of a city should provide parking for its guests. It ended up that we found a parking on the Lungotevere nearby, the car got stolen. Thank you st. George, not only we had a terrible time because of the untrained staff and extremely rude FO manager, but we got our car stolen as well.", "Date": "May 20, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "St. George Roma", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d634943-Reviews-St_George_Roma-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$317 - $483*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Giulia, 62</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00186</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "634943", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/25/61/256107155b2e1e27547bd4506c3c01256large.jpg"}}
