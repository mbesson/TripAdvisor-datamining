In this visit we came as a group with the big family, 6 adults and 4 children, 3 of them are below 5 years old. Kensington west was not an ideal place, I knew but we were willing to compromise. I have booked the hotel as usual, and made all booking enquiries two months before. All set. And our family started our long trip through UK, England countryside and Scottland all together by cars. There were five other cities that we spent the night before coming to our last stop in London. All hotels booked the same ways, and all were smooth. We arrived in London at 10 PM, and wanted to checked in to our four rooms straight away, as we were all tired. And what happened? Kensington West said there was no booking for us. The four rooms had been canceled and they sent the notification 2 days ago. They said the credit card I gave was declined. Though it worked for other 5 cities. I was like WHAT!! Why don't you notify us at least one week ago whilst our booking had been made 2 months before? Don't they even think that we had travelled and might not get access to our email? And these were kids we were talking about and it was late at night. We were trying to find other hotel that night but all full in London. The kids were afraid and tired and hungry. We were up to the emotion that we almost punch the guy at the reception. Some people were checked out but they said they cannot give us the room as it was booked for others. After two hours arguing, he finally gave one room with three bed for ten of us that night. Never ever I will stay in this hotel with no such consideration like this, with no profesionalism of people that manage the service for people who has travelled from across the world like me.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotherham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood for a short holiday or business trip!\u201d", "Author": "FutureGirl88", "ReviewID": "UR122667766", "Content": "Me and my two friends went down to London and spent one night at Kensington West.

The corridors are all over the place and include numerous fire doors to compensate for the fact that the owners clearly stuffed as many rooms into this property without any regard for customer experience. 3) The room was tiny and the cover to the synthetic duvet was not very nice (I'm trying to be polite here!), suffice to say I slept on top of the duvet, I really didn't fancy getting into the bed. 4) The walls are paper thin.

We decided to book this hotel based on it's location, just 300m from our business venue. We booked two twin rooms, but got doubles instead, since they were all out. As pointed out by other reviewers, the sheets on the beds were stained and dirty. The bed was indented in the middle, so you must image how uncomfortable the sleep was for two business colleagues. The bathroom was cleaned daily, but mold in corners and on the ceiling was a constant reminder of how bad this place was. For the majority of time, there was no hot water. You could only take showers around 3PM, when there was no one at the hotel. The shower drain was clogged and you had to take a shower in 2 minutes, trying not to flood the whole room. It then took approx 10 minutes for the water to drain. On the day of arrival there were two towels on the bed (in a double room), but when cleaning the rooms, they only left one towel every day, so we had to go to the reception and get another towel each morning. The rooms were claustrophobic (together with the bathroom approx 3x3 meters) and we were not even being able to move around the bed, with a third person in the room. The walls are as thin as paper and windows did not close completely so there was constant draft of wind during the nights coming over our heads. During our stay, me any my colleagues in the other room, who were not even on the same floor, were constantly woken up EVERY night by the noise on the halls, next door rooms or upper floors. On the last morning there, we were woken up by a couple getting it on in the room next door. Twice. Good for them, not so much for us, since it was 5 AM. We complained the each morning about the noises at night, but no one seemed to care. Since the noise was from inside the hotel and not the streets, they really should care. The hallways constantly smelled of food (curry) and cigarette smoke. There was a lot of smoking in the hotel amid all the laws and regulations. For the majority of our stay, the elevator was not operational because of the fire alarms constantly going off from all the smoking on the hallways. The bottom line is that this was the worst stay I've ever experienced. There was a lot of other minor issues (four working tv channels, indented bed, no closet) but that is something I can tolerate. The issues above, I cannot.

I can't recommend the breakfast, we had preordered it and canceled. Its basically yogurt and cereal (3.50). For a bit more, go to Tescos for a breakfast sandwich or go to Hammersmith or Earls Court to get an English breakfast (or anything else). At Hammersmith, you should find Barclays Bar on the right side of Kings Road and they serve a good English breakfast for around 3-5 pounds. The room they gave us was very small, but after 2 nights you get used to it. The ceiling was at a good height and there was plenty of headroom, but the walking space was very limited and only 1 person could walk at a time in the room (room was bunk bed, single bed, table and small open closet). The TV was OK, they had more free TV channels than Holiday Inn, such as VIVA and Dave. I wouldn't take a girl back to the hotel room though, but for a couple of friends its fine. DO bring a thin blanket and a pillow case, their bedding was disgusting. We're talking dry blood, hair and visible dirt (Thank god I didn't get a UV light) and it was pretty hard to adjust to, but after a while you get used to it. That was the only thing that really pissed me off about the hotel. The bathroom was very clean, but it was awfully tiny and it was a wet room. Using the sink meant getting your clothes wet no matter how hard you tried to avoid it, but the shower and the toilet were OK and there were no smells or anything, plus it had good ventilation. Their baggage room is in the lobby, we left our stuff there and we found it when we got back so no complaints there. My friends laptop was kept behind the counter. The price was excellent around 700 between 3 for 7 nights, its a good price for London and if you like your caffeine they offer free coffee, mocha, tea and cappuccino (you can unashamedly take as much as you like). The receptionists were very friendly (I'm not sure about them being professional, but I liked them all). Do not expect them to be plastic suck ups, remember this is a 2 star hotel and not the Hilton. My room mate was rude to them over a period of 2 days and they stopped saying Hi and Bye to him, but I guess this serves him right. Regardless of this they still accommodated his requests. Location 5/5 It is pretty safe, walking around at 11PM wasn't an issue and the only time we saw potential YOBs was at around 1AM walking from Tesco to our hotel on the main road. It was the only scare we had, but they pretty much ignored us. The station it is closest to is West Kensington, and the hotel is a 5 minute walk away straight ahead. West Kensington is within the Zone 1-2 of London (in the center) : 2 stops away from Hammersmith (kings road), 3 from high street kensington, 7-8 from Oxford circus and around 8 stops from Piccadilly circus. Its very close to a sports bar which serves British Ales like Doom Bar, etc called \"the 3 Kings\". There is a large Tesco shopping center 10 minutes walk from hotel, where you can buy a better breakfast and its also very close to a main road (forgot the name, but as you come to Barclays Bank instead of going straight , cross the road and you'll come across a number of English Pubs and pizza outlets, then you'll reach a main road where there are several places to eat or shop from. Reviewers of the Hotel must remember that this is a 2 star hotel and not a 5 star ,which is why I gave them a review rating of 4 stars and I would have given them 5 if the bathroom was a bit better and the bedding was clean.

I was very disappointed with this particular hotel. One of the main reasons I chose this hotel was the fact it had WiFI but the Wifi connection was horrendous. I had to purchase a pay-to-go broadband modem in the end from 02. Even after I had raised the matter up to the reception, there was no improvement (to be fair, i guess all she could do then was just to reboot it). We stayed in a room for 5 then a room for 3 when 2 of our party left earlier. The room for five was cramped but that was expected. What was not expected was a window that could not be closed (and the hotel is fairly near a very busy road), a sink so tiny that brushing our teeth was a challenge (plus it clogs) and a bath tub with shower facilities but no shower curtain? I seriously think there is not much point in advertising about their 'branded' shower gel when a simple thing like a shower curtain was not provided for. The room for three was better, esp the shower faciliity. Free hot choc and coffee is nice, but I could have gotten free breakfast and a room for four in Oxford hotel for the same price i was paying for a room for three. Plus the fact that the hotel was in zone two and that added quite a bit more to our travelling expenses. Worse of all was the staff. During my stay, I had come into contact with four different receptionists. Only one was friendly and efficient. All were foreign (and I am not being discriminatory as I am from the same part of the world as them), and do not take the time to listen to their guests even though their command of English was questionable. They initially refused to check my party in as I had made the booking under my name and I arrived later than the rest (even though I was told by the hotel during reservation that it would not be a problem). A few other niggling problems as well but too lengthy to detail here. The impression I got from this hotel was that the owner was not very invested in its management and left it to part-time staffers (mainly students). I would not recomment it to anyone because there are definitely hotels of equal, if not better value, in zone 1, considering their WiFi is really non-existent.

Not one of the nicer areas though as all was old and trash was everywhere (3) bathroom was too small. I am normal size but if you are a plus size person then this hotel is not for you. I would have to think twice about staying here again simply due to the bathroom size. It was smaller then those on cruise ships. It was adequate but very very small.

My sister stayed at this hotel and I made the reservation for her. I was concerned about a couple of bad reviews I saw on this site. Well the hotel is absolutely an excellent value for a very little money, and the bad things that has been said on this hotel are simply not true. I belive also the bad pictures I saw was created at art. My sister came to visit me and this was the second time she was travelling on her own, so I was concerned about the cleaness and the safety of the accompdation. Here my surprise the room was SPOTLESS, very clean from the catpet to the bed. The toilet was immaculate. I've travelled myself a lot and I've never found something like that with that money. The LOCATION was my second priority for my sister and I have to say was excellent. Very quite neibourhood and first of all SAFE. My sister was alone and she felt perfectelely safe. Very close to the tube station ( district line ) and close to hammersmith road, where the bus number 9 goes to the town. The reception was very kind with me and let me see the room for my sister the day before. One thing the rooms are small but was perfect place to sleep safe clean and quite. Is a bed and breakfast! For the little money my sister paid would be hard to find a place as clean as this. Honestly!!! PS: I would like to suggest to the person who left the bad review about this hotel and was so disappointed to spend a little more money (than 30 \u00c2\u00a3 per night) and go straight to Her Majesty the Queen of England and ask if she could rent out a room in Backingam Palace.", "Date": "January 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow", "Title": "\u201cGreat value!\u201d", "Author": "nosduhnivek", "ReviewID": "UR22912599", "Content": "Myself and 4 friends had two rooms in this hotel.

I looked directly on the Kensington West hotel site and for some reason, a double room with en-suite cost the same as a single room (\u00c2\u00a338), and reviews were good, so I booked up for the following evening. I arrived at midday and was able to leave my case in a secure luggage room until i checked in later in the evening, when I returned to the hotel. The staff were very helpful and directed me to my room. I was surprised at how clean the room was, it looked very contemporary and had everything I needed for the night. I had no problems with noise at night and the bathroom facilities were clean and above average. The next day, once I had checked out, I was still able to leave my case in the luggage room until I was ready to collect it on my way back to the train station that evening.

We chose it for the price, and because we could get a quad room on short notice (we booked 3 days before we arrived). For a budget hotel, this is a good option. It's not necessarily near any places on the to-do list, but it is only a 5 minute walk to the West Kensington Tube station, with easy access to everywhere via Tube. The neighborhood seemed to be very working class, and the hotel was a few blocks from the nearest busy street. We did not feel uneasy about the location, but a woman on her own might not feel the same way. As with every hotel where we've stayed in London, there was conversation noise from outside until the early hours of the night. The hotel was clean and recently refurbished. The kids loved the fold-up bunk beds, which were ready made with clean linens. As with all London hotel rooms, this was small, but it was easier to move around in than our last quad room in London, and more smartly laid out. The minimalist wardrobe had no doors, so it was easy to stow our stuff without having to rearrange the room. The room is equipped with a good, flat screen tv for your BBC viewing pleasure, though it's really only visible from the double bed. On check-in, our room for 4 only contained 1 towel, but the front desk clerk took care of that reasonably quickly. They don't have keys to the linen closet after the cleaning staff leaves, so check that you have what you need as soon as you check in. The light fixtures were cracked from being screwed too tightly, and the bathroom shelf was missing, but the room was otherwise in good repair. I didn't see any air conditioning, but we don't visit London in the summer... There are free hot drinks in the lobby, but don't expect much from the add-on breakfast. It appeared to be yogurt and a granola bar. It was not really overpriced, just not quite what we wanted for breakfast. We simply purchased breakfast food from the grocery store and had that before heading out for the day. There weren't many places to eat nearby, but it was easy to find grub near the places we were visiting, so that did not bother us. Overall, we were happy with this hotel. For a place to sleep between forays into the city, it was very adequate, and we would consider it again.", "Date": "March 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "basel", "Title": "\u201cStay away from this place!!

Second, nothing worked at front desk, credit card mach., phone, internet, wireless etc. Third I was checked into a closet, seriously I have stayed in London many times before, this was a walk in closet; with a suitcase you had to step on the bed to get to bathroom. The door would not open fully from the bathroom as the bed is 6 inches away. I requested another room, after some serious grumbling I was sent to antoher room. Larger size, bathroom was ridiculous small. The toilet was in the shower, YES it is!!! The shower curtain had so much mold it was HARD!! YES!!

Multiple doors did not bother us as this is the standard in London due to fire safety regulations. But from previous reviews and my own experience, it seems like the lift is permanently out of order! This may be a problem if you are staying on the higher floors (my second floor room was accessible) and have to lug your suitcase up the narrow staircase. So guests may wish to request a room on the lower floors. The room is very very small! Once we opened our samsonite on the floor there was hardly space to walk around. We had to shimmy past each other sideways and if I sat on the edge of the bed, my knees almost touched the facing wall.... There was no wardrobe to speak of, only a metal bar in an open wooden compartment 1.5ft across, but with hangers for use. The bathroom was clean and modern with black and white tiles. But once again, the sink was tiny to properly brush my teeth over. No towels or toiletries were provided, which was a bit of a disappointment. However, the lovely high ceilings, easy-on-the-eye pastel green walls and sheets, new carpeting really made this a good deal for the night. No problem with the wifi connection and people at the front desk were helpful and printed out the e-tickets we needed for our onward journey.

The rooms were clean and it did seem as if they were newly refurbished which was nice. The rooms are rather small, but this is London and that's what you get. The room was mostly taken up by a bed and the dresser/desk, but the two of us were able to get around the room without any problems. There was a flat screen TV on a bracket that was convenient to catch the news or a movie on, but not in the way or taking up valuable space. The room served its purpose for us, which was mainly as a place to sleep between busy days sightseeing. I would reiterate the comment others have made about the stairs and doors. You do go through a few doors and probably one or two flights of staits on your way in and out so I would consider that if you think about staying here. At the end of the day, this was a pretty good hotel for the money and we would definitely think about staying here again. Staff The staff was very friendly and helped us on a few occasions. First we needed to check in early and this wasn't a problem at all. Secondly, we needed a wake up call one morning to catch a train and when we discovered our room had no phone outlet, the front desk clerk (who was as surprised as us about the phone) volunteered to come by our room and knock on the door at 6AM so we could catch our train. Location We felt the location was great! It was a five minute walk to the West Kensington tube station which allows you to take the District Line to almost all of the major tourist attractions. It's not hard to switch trains in London, but if you can avoid it, why wouldn't you? There weren't a ton of places to eat near the hotel, but there were enough to get by if you had to. There was a pub/bar, a Chinese restaurant, and a few cafes that were open for breakfast and lunch. We mostly ate closer to the City Center, but on the few nights we were near the hotel we ate in the area and it was great.
