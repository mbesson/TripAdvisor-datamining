I was told that I could have two complimentary drinks at the rooftop bar while my room was being cleaned. When I got up to the bar, I was told I could only have complimentary soft drinks but would have to pay for my wine. Not a great welcome for a hotel guest. Once in the room, I ordered 24 hour WiFi access for 140 HKD and hooked up my laptop. I then tried to hook up my phone to the same service and was told I would have to pay another 140 HKD because it is a different device- ridiculous. Nowhere in the Terms and Conditions did it state that the rate of 140 HKD per day applies per device, and this is not the norm in most hotels. In fact, most hotels offer free WiFi service to begin with, let alone charge guests for each device. The room was a decent size and the bed was comfortable. The floor of the bathtub was peeling and the shampoo/soap in the bathroom was not replaced until the fourth day of our stay. The breakfast spread is average but the service in the restaurant is quite good. The concierge is not very knowledgeable and does not offer to call a venue when he is not sure about it, as they typically do in other hotels worldwide. Overall, the hotel is clean and comfortable but the level of service is not up to my expectations.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat room, Good Location, Best Hotel in Causewaybay area\u201d", "Author": "kim511", "ReviewID": "UR139172609", "Content": "Crowne Plaza Hotel is located one block behind Times Square.

Location is great in Causeway bay and very close to Times Square and major shopping malls. Rooms are also very nicely appointed and modern. One point of note which I see in many comments as a positive, but I have another negative side to add. The Bathroom has a huge glass shower which looks into the bedroom and bathroom, but through from the bedroom side, when you are sitting on the toilet, imagine if your partner/lover/colleague could see you in the compromised position, which is the case here. In my case it wasn't a problem, as I have always wanted to see my other half like that :) No access to club lounge for Platinum members, very strange. Seems like the hotel uses this as a means to get people to spend more money - room upgrade sir? Pool area is quite small, but very nice on the roof level. However for a hotel of this size it has 5 sun beds, two in the pool (nice), two outside and another miles away. Breakfast not included in room (very strange for Platinum again!) and very expensive.... however nearby shops and starbucks fill that need for a fraction of the price. Very nice hotel, but could be oh so much nicer.

I arrived in the middle of the night on June 30th and was shocked when I discovered the manager had waited until my arrival before going home for the night. The staff was wonderful during my entire stay, going as far as asking what my favorite fruit was so that they could have a fresh basket for me every day! The room was large and perfect for the average business traveller or couple. The furniture and fixtures were also modern, clean, and comfortable. The location of this hotel is perfect, regardless of your plans while in Hong Kong. It's a two-minute walk to the MTR and Times Square. Being in Causeway Bay means you have access to every type of shopping imagineable. The gym of the hotel looks over the Happy Valley Race Course. I was lucky enough to be on the treadmil during the last race of the season and got to view it for free! My one negative view of the hotel was the housekeeping. Since I was staying for so long, I thought it was unnescessary to have someone clean and tidy my room on a daily basis. I asked the housekeeper if they could serivce my room twice a week, but apparently that wasn't allowed. Instead, I was forced into keeping my \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door at all times. This resulted in a daily message indicating that they tried to service my room. For most people this wouldn't be a problem and in the end it really wasn't that big of a deal. I was more annoyed by the fact that they wouldn't accomodate such a simple request. The hotel is expensive from a US perspective, but it is reasonable for Hong Kong. I would definately recommend this hotel to everyone I know looking for a great place to stay while in visiting Hong Kong.

The location in Causeway Bay is a short walk from the MTR station and Times Square for shopping and to the Hong Kong Jockey Club.

Kudos to the staff for taking care of guests during Typhoon Vincente; they did a great job. I have stayed at this property a couple of times, so understand my dismay when last week I arrived to find the lobby bar replaced by a tacky high end home accessory store. While I suppose there is more money to be made selling this stuff, eliminating this lobby gathering space has really struck a blow to what was a really nice hotel. Now there is no place to meet for business or even gather unless you take the lift to the top floors. And even there, those venues are poorly designed for a business meeting one being outside. And while I was there one of the bars was closed to accommodate a private group, forcing everyone to the outside bar in dreadful weather. The business center moved to what is basically a couple of tables off the lobby, barely meeting the description. The lobby now consists of one unisex bathroom and strangely designed low to the ground seating which looks nice, but is uncomfortable and inadequate.

At check-in, I was told that because I was enrolled in the Priority Club Rewards program (from a previous stay at a Holiday Inn, part of the same hotel group), wi-fi would be complimentary. That was great (and the wi-fi was fast) but I'm baffled about why you'd try to inconvenience guests who hadn't enrolled by charging them an hourly or 24 hour rate for internet access. I'd have been extremely annoyed if I hadn't had complementary wifi. I was also given 2 cocktail coupons for the bar on the top floor. My wife and I enjoyed these - just a pity the weather wasn't good enough to try out the pool next to the bar. The concierge desk helped us confirm ferry times for travel to the mainland and quickly found us a taxi when it was time to leave.

Some other points: Location - The hotel is a short walk from the Causeway Bay Station, with good links to Central and beyond. It takes about 47 min. from the airport (Airport Express to Hong Kong / Central Station and then the Island Line to Causeway Bay Station), though there is a bit of walking from Hong Kong / Central Station until you arrive at the hotel. Since I had some luggage, I took a cab directly to Hong Kong Station on the way back. There are also plenty of restaurants (there is a Starbucks across the street), bars and shopping (e.g. Times Square) around the property. Friendly staff - Most of the staff spoke good English and they were willing to help out. The Front Desk took care of several reservations, both in Hong Kong and Macau, during our stay. Room - The room and common areas were spotless...the hotel is fairly new. I was upgraded to a room on the 26th floor, which is the Executive Level. The rooms are a little on the small side, though not bad for Hong Kong and the price you are paying. It came with free bottles water (refreshed daily), fruit and Internet. I'm not sure if this was because it\u2019s on the Executive Floor or my status (I'm Platinum). There was a nice view of the city from my room and came with some neat pieces of technology (iPod dock, DVD/CD player, speakers throughout, mobile hotel phone, etc.) Facilities - There are a few restaurants within the hotel, though I did not eat in any of them. I did order room service on a few occasions, which was above average for hotel food (it was certainly better then what I have had at Crowne Plazas in the UK). There is a bar on the 25th floor that is on the same level of the pool.

In contrast I have to say the staff at the 28th floor bar are not the same. They are all a bit 'off-hand' & seem to have an attitude. There is a happy hour on 28th floor bar where you buy one drink get one free and some nights if there's 2 of you and you only want one drink they try to enforce a 'you must order 2 and then get 2 free' rule. We only wanted one drink each and they will bend the rules if you insist but I find this petty 'nickel and dining' of guests very off putting especially when you are a guest in the hotel and paying a lot for a room. The location of the hotel is great - only 10 mins walk (yes it is that far) from Causeway Bay MTR station - looks nearer but there's a long underground walk to the platforms. It's on some good bus routes - the no.10 right outside goes into Central in 10-12 mins. If you want to come back by tram for the experience take the 'Happy Valley' tram only as that drops you right at the lobby.

As the main trip purpose was Lunar New Year shopping and meeting my sister who stays in Wan Chai, we decided on Hotel Crowne Plaza due to the good corporate room rate, it's proximity to causeway bay and Times Square. The recent positive reviews on Tripadvisor also helped in our choice. It was 12 deg C when we arrived in HK on 5 Jan. After a short 30 mins ride on the Airport Express, we arrived at HK station (terminal station). As I bought the return airport express tickets online at HKD160 per person (HSBC credit card promotion), I collected the tickets from the Customer Service Counter before exiting the station. A short taxi ride from HK station to the hotel costs HKD32. Check in was prompt and efficient. The guest room at 34 sq m is clearly one of the most spacious we have seen for HK and also one of the most well equipped: iPod/iPhone docking station, in-room mobile and ample sockets. Bed is comfortable and everything still looks new. Across the road from the hotel are small eateries where we had our breakfasts. Our favorite Chi Kei wanton noodle restaurant at 52 Russell St, is 5 mins walk away. Our meal for 3 consisting costs HKD 110. Another plus point especially for guests with young children is the gift of Chuppa Chup lollipops at the Concierge.

It was a very pleasant surprise. Location-wise it is not situated smack in the middle of Causeway Bay like Excelsior, but slightly out of the way (it is near Times Square and the MTR exit at Times Square, but those familiar with HK will know that there is a longish walk through an underground tunnel from the Times Square exit to actually get to the main MTR station). This was the only downside. We took three deluxe rooms during the stay. All were very spacious, very new, clean, and had the latest in amenities like ipod docking stations, large flat screen tv. Beds were very comfy, not too hard or too soft. Sheets were incredibly smooth and silky. Bathrooms were large and well-appointed with both shower and bath (I should point out that although there is an option to have a see through glass panel between the shower and bedroom, there is a wooden sliding door which can be pulled over the panel if you prefer your privacy in the shower). The welcome platter of fruit was a nice touch. Reception was helpful though slightly slow on the uptake (we communicated with them in English), and although we had asked for a slightly complicated rooming arrangement with regard to our connecting rooms, this was arranged with no fuss at all, as was a late checkout on the last day. The pool is small, really just for lounging in. The rooftop bar gives a great view of the city if you can see through the smog when you are there! We didn't try the food in the hotel - it looked pricey, but there are choices galore in the vicinity and throughout HK.

Here are some thoughts and experiences from our trip: 1. Crowne Plaza's LOCATION is excellent, being near Causeway Bay MTR station from where you can reach most interesting places in HK conveniently. 2. If you like SHOPPING, the hotel is in a shopping belt anchored by the very popular Times Square; you can spend the rest of your visit here, and will probably still not have covered all the shops. 3. The hotel ROOM My family stayed on the club floor, and as expected, the rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The shower room is large, clean and modern, and has good amenities including robes and large towels. One big plus factor for Crowne Plaza hotels generally is their big and well designed rooms. 4. If good FOOD is important to you, there is a variety of good restaurants near the hotel. --I recommend One Sushi, which is just across from the hotel. It serves a good range of fresh, elegantly made sushi (see picture) and the price is pretty reasonable--HK$800 for 5 persons. A Japanese restaurant, Rakuen, at Tang Lung street off Hennessy Road, on the 12th floor of Circle Tower, is a 12-minute walk from the hotel--the place gives the feeling of a small japanese restaurant; food is not bad but somewhat expensive: HK$ 1500 for 5 adults. The hotel staff recommended the Chinese restaurant just to the right hand side of the hotel \uff08\u51e4\u57ce\uff09. We tried the dim sum--it wasn't expensive, HK$ 400 for 5 adults--but I don't recommend this place as the dim sum was blah. There is a wanton noodle restaurant called \u6c60\u8bb0\uff0calong Percival Street, just 3 minutes walk from Times Square. Excellent wanton noodle at down to earth prices; the restaurant is crammed and noisy, but we got used to it. For Chinese visitors, if you want to take \"tortoise cream\" or \u9f9f\u82d3\u818f\uff0cjust go to \u606d\u548c\u5802 which is a few steps away from the noodle restaurant. Choose the cold one. I had the one which was HK$45--yummy. We also tried the Victoria City Chinese restaurant on level 2 of the hotel. The food was good, and the price was astronomical--considering we only had dishes meant for paupers. The decor of the restaurant can be described as non-descript. Breakfast is at Kudos which is on the hotel's 1st Floor. It's a competent restaurant and, like most good Asian hotels, serve both decent Asian and international cuisines. The staff in this restaurant were very helpful and friendly. On the second morning of our stay, they already knew who we were when we went for our breakfast. 5. Hotel STAFF When I arrived, I discovered that the Club Lounge had been changed to Victoria City Chinese restaurant. Guests on club floor rooms are supposed to enjoy \"club lounge\" facilities. With the lounge gone, management has made a lame effort to provide \"the same benefits\" for those staying on the Club Floor. It was not comparable to the experience as I had in other Crowne Plaza or Intercontinental hotels. I conveyed my disappointment to the hotel GM, To his credit, he and his staff made great efforts to placate me, and to redeem the hotel. The GM, Harold Yung, wanted to meet me to explain the situation personally--though my schedule didn't allow that. Their Duty Manager Paul went out of his way to make me feel comfortable and happy, notwithstanding the lack of the lounge. He spoke to me a number of times to make sure I was coasting along nicely. Henry who was manning the Priority Counter was also very helpful with my enquiries. Our room attendant, who is from Fujian, China, never failed to smile and chat with us in a friendly manner whenever we bumped into her. What a gem! The hotel did a couple of neat things for my 1-year old grandson: The hotel made a special birthday cake for him, and also arranged for daily baby food to be made for him--besides providing a comfortable crib at no charge. On the day of our departure, Duty manager Paul saw us off in a limousine arranged by the hotel. We recognise the special efforts he made in making us feel valued. Thank you, Paul! For economic reasons, the hotel owners decided to convert the lounge into a restaurant. We can't blame the hotel staff for that. I do appreciate the efforts the hotel's GM and managers devoted to \"service recovery.\" In general the staff were very friendly and helpful. Tip on TIPs: For the bell hop, HK$20 appeared to be appreciated. For the driver who brought us to the airport, I did a HK$60, as he also helped with unloading our luggage. He didn't seem displeased. PLACES OF INTEREST 1. If you are first time in HK, you probably would want to go to all the tourist places--Disneyland, Ocean Park, the Peak, the Big Buddha. Having been to HK a number of times, we chose untouristy places to visit. LLAMMA island was great for strolling and hiking. Quaint little place, no cars. Good food, which wasn't expensive. There is a solitary modern windmill on the mountian, up there somewhere, after you have trudged uphill for about 25 minutes. Just one of those white wind turbines you see from time to time on TV. From high you can also get a panoramic view of parts of Hong Kong. What's special about this island is that it's such a serene place within a metropolis. To get to Llamma Island: From Causeway Bay MTR, go the Central Station, cross over to Pier Number 4, get a ferry to Yuen Shue Wan, which is on Llamma island--the fare is about HK$16--for a 30 minutes' ride. Visiting HONG KONG UNIVERSITY was educational. It is unlike other universities I have visited. The university buildings are literally dispersed over the slope of a mountain. The buildings are not pretty; they look like office buildings, some rather old too. The cafeteria is modern and serves international and local cuisines. As a non student, you can only grab a cup of coffee there. I would say this university has some character. Our family took a cab from Central MTR station to the university entrance, HK$27. On the way back to the hotel, we took a minibus...and got off at Causeway Bay. You probably should speak Cantonese if you want to do the minibus. My family also spent some time in HONG KONG PARK. You can get there via Pacific Place, a huge modern shopping mall accessible from the Admiralty MTR station. The park is small, but it's unique as you can see all the spanking new skyscrapers hovering behind the flowers and trees of the park. There's an aviary which has a large variety of birds flying around, doing things birds do (like, in our imagination, threatening to spread bird flu), within a enclosed space. There is also a small exhibition space for Chinese stone seals. I like the park, with locals and foreigners strolling around, looking at the floral and fauna, because it gives me a feel of the real HK . It's not touristy. Free entrance to the park and its facilities. JOCKEY CLUB. The Club, with its wide green field and tracks, is just 10 minutes by foot from the hotel. I consider it one of the best things about Crowne Plaza. You can do your exercise in a nice open and green space, and soak in the old and new atmosphere of HK created by the surrounding old and new buildings. Forget about the nice gym in the hotel, and go down the race course! All manner of people are jogging, walking and playing football there. LOCAl OPEN MARKET. If you have never been to one, you must do so. If you have been to one, you will, like me, want to go again. There's one near the hotel, along Hennessy road; ask the hotel staff and they will tell you. It's about 12-minute walk from the hotel. You will find fish, still alive and jumping, being sold by the road. Not exactly kind, but rather picturesque. Stalls are selling fruit, vegetables, dried food stuff, fish, chicken....whatever can be eaten the Chinese way. Noise level--hundreds of decibels. If you have any questions, do email me, and I'll see if I can answer them.

The internet facilities were reasonable, the rooms stylish and the beds really comfortable. All in all a very good base either for business or pleasure when visiting Hong King.

As a business traveller, I very much appreciate the opportunity to get out of my room to do some work in the relatively quiet and calm surroundings a club lounge offers in many IC group hotels around the world. The proposed alternative i.e. the bar on the top floor was too public for this purpose. So for this fact only ill give 4 stars rather than 5 - if they can fix this before my next visit Ill consider upgrading!

I stayed in a king bed room with a view of the Happy Valley racecourse, which was fabulous: Hong Kong is such a 'concrete city', it really does make a difference to be able to look outside your hotel room window, and see some greenery (especially with blue skies and sunshine). The room itself was quite spacious, and extremely well designed: besides a very comfortable bed, well laid out closets and storage space and a big bathroom with a 'rainforest' shower, there were some extras which do give this hotel quite an edge over the competition. The first thing to mention is the fantastic in room entertainment system, which offers a big flat screen TV, in room DVD player and a superior sound system built into the ceiling of the room. The sound system is even installed in the bathroom, and due to a clever design feature (sliding door between bedroom and bathroom shower cubicle) one can take a shower and still watch TV at the same time. Even though this is not really a \"necessity\", it sure does add a huge amount of \"cool\" to the room experience. Did I mention that the sound quality is first rate, and the choice of channels and pay-per-view movies is extensive? The second great feature of the room is the room layout and also the quality of the furniture itself: these days, so many modern and/or newly built hotels do fall completely short in this department. Not so the Crowne Plaza Causeway Bay: whether it is the cleverly placed working desk, the bathroom and bedroom layout, the vast storage area (including an easily accessible safe) or the well stocked and organized mini bar, as well as the ample storage space for suitcases; this hotel room does offer great functionality as well as a welcoming, warm ambience in true 'urban chique' style. The materials used within the room were all of very high quality, and this can also be said of the service level provided. During my entire stay, I only encountered friendly staff and had very positive experiences with all the services ordered. From in-room dining (I never waited more than 20 minutes for an order) to laundry service and all the way to the general room service: everything was top notch. I did encounter some problems with other hotel guests calling my room at odd times, and charges of these calls miraculously showing up on my hotel bill. But the charges were immediately taken off my bill once I informed the check out staff that I had not used the phone - no questions asked. I also took breakfast on two days in the restaurant on the first floor: the selection of items offered was extensive (Western and Asian staples were offered), the service friendly and attentive, and the restaurant experience was overall enjoyable (even though, it does not come at a cheap price). The Crowne Plaze Causeway Bay is just a short walk away from Times Square and the World Trade Center building. There are tons of good restaurants close to the hotel, and the shopping district surrounding the hotel does offer endless choices for any shopper's taste and budget. The hotel offers a well equipped gym as well as a roof top swimming pool and bar with great views over the city. Connectivity within Hong Kong is superb - due to the subway being very close by as well as numerous bus and tram lines right in front of the hotel. I took the Airport Express to and from Hong Kong Station, and from there one can simply take a taxi to the hotel or use the subway. Everything in Central, Wanchai and Causeway Bay is easily reachable within minutes, and even trips to Kowloon are easily manageable. All in all, the Crowne Plaza Causeway Bay is a fabulous hotel offering high quality service. It is easily accessible and centrally located, and offers great service and amenities - whether you are a business traveler or on holidays.

I was offered an up-grade to a room with a view but as I had booked the most expensive option available, other than a suite and I am a Platinum member, I couldn\u2019t understand how I could be up-graded. I asked to see the two rooms, to compare the difference but suddenly the language barrier dropped and I decided not to pursue the matter further. As the club lounge in this hotel has been converted into a Chinese restaurant; although, I can hardly believe that HK needs yet another Chinese restaurant, the private breakfast and drinks facilities no longer exist. The club floor \u2018happy hour\u2019, which is a great Crowne Plaza plus, no longer exists either. One can enjoy drinks during \u2018happy hour\u2019 but in the public bar, next to the swimming pool on the roof, I tried this and was told that I could occupy my table for only twenty minutes, as it was booked. Business travellers need a separate facility, where the screams of swimmers and canto-pop music, do not drown their conversation and they do not need to book tables. Intercontinental Hotels, please give us back our Crowne Plaza club facilities, or clearly state on your Website booking pages, which of your hotels do not provide these facilities. If you do not provide the normal CP Club Facilities, which is the main reason why business travellers use your hotels, you should not advertise them on your Website or indeed, charge for them. Business travellers do not wish to trawl through the small print every time we book a hotel; if it says \u2018club\u2019 then it should mean \u2018club\u2019 and the facilities provided should be standard. This is a good hotel, it could be excellent.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "west australia", "Title": "\u201cWish I had stayed at this hotel 1st time\u201d", "Author": "click11", "ReviewID": "UR120222654", "Content": "Just loved everything about this hotel- other than the foyer.

Generally used the MTR which was much easier. As with the locations of many other HK hotels, lots of stores and local restaurants close by. We also found a laundry-mate a few blocks away where we could drop off laundry then pick it up later, which was great and cheape than doing it with the hotel.

It acts as a room telephone but in the shape of mobile phone. It's very useful and practical for visitors. Breakfast was excellent. The menu selection wasn't wide but the taste and quality is what you expect from Crowne Plaza.

Nearest MTR is Causeway Bay station via the Time Sq exit. The hotel is stil less than a year old and as such the interior and furnishing are still new and pleasant.

Otherwise, you'd be stuck with the room view that faces a next block at a close distance, especially if you are assigned to rooms towards the end nearer the left hand side (assuming you are facing the hotel block). The pool which opens up to a nice view is actually quite small to enable an invigorating workout. Service-wise, still a littled jagged and nowhere near standards of established chains such as JW Marriott, Shangri-la and boutiques like Lanson Place. The reason I mentioned that this is not that suited for business travellers is because of the location of the hotel. The cab stand at the lobby is situated at the end of Leighton Road. To travel by cab from the hotel to Central (if your office is located there), the cab must travel up further to Happy Valley first before looping back down to Causeway Bay, where you'd be stuck a little in peak hour traffic. Also, from 830am to 9 plus in the morning, getting a cab can be a long wait. I waited for 20min and gave up to walk up a few blocks to hail a cab myself.

Location- Actually not ideal as the main areas tourists go to in HK are along the red line i.e. Central, Tsim Sha Tsui and Mongkok while Causeway Bay is on the blue line, which would entail a transfer to virtually everywhere you go. Also, the walk from the Causeway Bay MTR station to the nearest exit to the hotel entails an extremely long walk. Elderly folks should note this. view from room- View is average if you get rooms facing Happy Valley (from my low level), but if you get rooms facing Leighton Road, all you see out of the window are buildings just metres away. Absolutely not worth the money. Furnishing- The furnishing in the rooms were new and relatively plush. Bathrooms were decent sized with a glass wall separating the shower area from the room.

So, in short, for the kind of things we like to do, namely exploring the area on foot, it's a perfect location. The room was very nice. The bed was really comfortable. The hotel was very quiet. The shower and bathroom was very nice. The maid service was excellent. The hotel employees were very nice and helpful. There are several small things. I would agree with reviews that say the pool is very nice, but lacks privacy, especially at night. The night club is right beside it, and has a big glass wall overlooking the pool. At night you do feel a bit like you are in a fish bowl. During the day, the club is largely empty. So, this is the time to use it unless you like being seen and likely the topic of conversation in swimming attire by fully clothed people. I know it is a common practice in Asia to charge for internet. But, from a U.S. perspective internet access in a nice hotel is a right of passage. The internet at the hotel will cost you HK$200, per device, per day, wired or wireless. You have to ascent to their terms and conditions and renew this every day. They did comp ours as a Platinum Level perk. But, be aware of this significant potential cost. Hong Kong has several widespread wireless internet providers which are much cheaper. You can subscribe online on the Airport Express train to save some money if you need internet,. and it will work all over the city in many places. This is very convenient if you are using an Android, Blackberry or iPhone with WiFi to check email, etc. in lieu of very high cellular data roaming rates. We stayed in the hotel using reward nights. My travel agent, not paying proper attention to the time difference had us checking out one day earlier than our return flight. The hotel management would not allow us to book another reward night, but required payment of the regular room rate via credit card, claiming that all of their reward night rooms were taken. The hotel clearly makes more money when they host cash customers, instead of accepting credits from the rewards program. But, considering we had spent ten days in the hotel, I really considered this petty and cheap and was quite annoyed. This was discretionary on the part of the hotel. I think they should have allowed us to book a further reward night to cover this obvious mistake in the initial reservation. All in all I would say it was an excellent hotel. I would highly recommend it!", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot impressed\u201d", "Author": "jetsettel", "ReviewID": "UR115784941", "Content": "Came here for a meeting from bangkok, and arrived at 7.25pm.

The Hotel is a bit strange in that it looks nothing really from outside, almost drab compared to the new glass tower blocks everywhere (more skyscrapers in HK than in NYC) However don\u2019t be disappointed \u2013 after a somewhat small reception area, and being checked in by typical HK efficiency .... you get to your room .... and what a room. One wall floor to ceiling glass window .. massive flat screen TV with surround sound, and a iPad dock. Desk has all working needs including free WiFi and charging points for all types of phones & Laptops ... AC plugs in HK are same as UK. There is a nice roof top pool along side the bar .. unfortunately we arrived in Chinese New Year ,... and it had shut for annual maintenance. The bar has great views over HK and you sit outside on roof top balcony, great in evening breeze. I used the gym each day which is at top of Hotel and looks out over the stunning vista of the Lower levels and the Honk Kong racecourse .. I only ate breakfast at hotel ... and what a breakfast ... everything Western you could think of, cereals, breads, croissants, pancakes, eggs, bacon etc,. ... all omelettes, eggs cooked fresh while you wait ... nothing \u2018keeping warm\u2019 here. Plus a hundred things Asian .. most of which I had no idea what they were cooking \uf04a We were in Causeway Bay ... which means one block away is Time Square and the biggest shopping Mall around ... all you could want to buy, plus 2 floors of just restaurants ... any cuisine you could want. However get out and about in the side streets to find real places to eat ... noisy, chaotic, but great value and fun. Recommend going to Soho ... loads of choice restaurants, and great prices. If you have the time take the cable car to Lan Tao island, and the monastery and see the worlds biggest bronze Buddha sitting on top of the mountain .... so different to noise of HK. They have just opened a Disney Land ... but kept well away from that. For a night out get the tram from central up to the Peak (don\u2019t eat there) grab a beer, watch the sun go down and the light show come on ......... breath taking. If you want to do a real touristy thing get to Aberdeen harbour and take in a meal at the Floating Jumbo Restaurant .... if you choose a banquet ... you will get course after course of things that you won\u2019t recognise and would never choose .. but colours and tastes are amazing.

Someone had used our room number to charge drinks, cigarettes and food from the bar on level 28. When we disputed this charge, they made us feel like they didn't believe us.

The service of the bellman at the front door was great. We never waited for a taxi as they always got one as they saw us approaching the door. It was so easy. The gym is small but does the trick with treadmills, bicycles, weights etc. The bar and pool area at night are beautiful and the views of the city great. Causeway Bay is great as opposite the hotel you have a great sushi rest and a 7/11 which is great if you want to buy your soft drinks, cakes and other items. A 5 minute walk from the hotel brings you to Times Square which is a huge shopping centre with a great choice of a food court as well.

A very central location for shopping. Rooms 1) We got a deluxe room and the size was very good. Furniture, Furnishing and Lightning were all very modern and coordinated. Ceiling was also much higher than other near-by hotels, thus giving you a good feeling of the space when you enter the room. Being a new hotel, the room was clean and well-maintained. The view from the room was not much to rave about though. We got the view facing the opposite building, therefore, the curtains were drawn most of the time. 2) The bathroom was a definite plus. Generous space and the lighting was bright and cozy. Separate shower and long bath area was very welcomed. The sliding door mentioned in other reviews was a clever design idea and we could watch TV while showering at the same time. The only drawback was the sink/vanity area. It gets a little flooded with water when we wash up. The water stayed around the table top and flow onto the floor if we don't wipe up on time. Minus The following are not really negatives, but more of personal preferences and observations. 1) Breakfast on Sunday morning was chaotic. The whole dinning area was crowded with people. Food and beverages tend to run out and not being refilled on time. Tables and dishes were also not promptly cleared. Management should consider having more staff during peak periods, else, the tables looked very untidy. Situations on weekday mornings were not as bad. The spread for breakfast was rather standard; no surprises. 2) Received a rather impolite reply (we feel) when we checked-in. We asked for a nice room and was told that our reserved room is already very nice and the next best room would be a suite. A polite and happy - \"Certainly!\" would have been much more welcomed. Actually, we wouldn't have known that at the end of the day, the same reserved room was given to us. However, it would have made the checked-in experience much more pleasant and the hotel being portrayed as a very responsive hotel; without additional cost to them.

The bar/lounge, the swimming pool and the exercise room on the 27th and 28th floors have good views of the surrounding areas, especially at night. Breakfast in the hotel was quite good, with both Asian and Western selections. The hotel is within short walking distance to Time Square, Causeway Bay subway station, Jardine Bazaar, numerous shops and restaurants.

Check in was done efficiently although the staff wasn\u2019t particularly friendly. However this is Hong Kong and unless you stay at some $$$ hotels don\u2019t expect too much smile. Room is very clean and well design. I particularly like the TV system and the funky bathroom. It\u2019s definitely the best Crowne Plaza I have stayed at. The room is also very quiet. Agree on previous review that the rooms with view toward Happy Valley are much better than city view. During my stay I made the most of the roof top swimming pool. It\u2019s essential during the summer months. Sometimes I was just tired of browsing the endless shopping malls and this place is an oasis. I found shopping in Hong Kong actually very boring and expensive, so tend to spend my time eating Dim Sum, swimming and do a bit sightseeing. Service at the pool side was great.

A good television with iPod dock, speakers and great range of channels. Each room also comes with a mobile phone that doubles as a hotel phone, so you can stay connected while out of the hotel \u2013 a sensational idea. The common areas are also top class, with a spacious restaurant, well-manned business centre and an outdoor smoking patio. The two floors at the top of the hotel are also public areas.

Again, amazing d\u00e9cor. We were there over the weekend so saw first hand how busy the hotel can get. There was a pool party on on Sunday afternoon, which I found quite odd, but interesting nonetheless. It was clearly a function organised by outside guests, but in-house guests were able to use the pool deck and dodge the entry fee - although two families that had obviously planned a quiet afternoon by the pool didn\u2019t seem pleased with the inconvenience of a pool party (that was not out of hand but messy nonetheless). I must admit that I share this disappointment with them. This came after the bar being closed for a private function the day before. Staff were helpful and courteous but there were long waits, specially at reception on check in and check out.

Right away you\u2019ll arrive, you\u2019ll be welcome by a very friendly and efficient staff. We arrived late at night and immediately after I said we booked for a Crowne Plaza Club room, a charming girl escorted us to the second floor for a private check in next to the Club Lounge. Everything has been done with elegance, professionalism and a lot of kindness asking us how was our flight, giving us details about the benefits of the Club lounge\u2026 Unfortunately, nobody escorted us into our room and in a five stars hotel we expect this service\u2026 Anyway, we discovered the room by ourselves. Nicely decorated, very spacious and with a fantastic view on Happy Valley (very interesting on Wednesday evening when there are race courses\u2026). We found the bathroom extremely comfortable with a separate rain shower opened on the bedroom (but you still can close a wood door if you wanna privacy\u2026) and a deep bathtub. There is a very good equipment in the room and even a mobile phone not to miss any call when you go out (A precious service free of charge and only the calls you\u2019ll give will be charged). Regarding the breakfast, we have been very happy to have a very good buffet with an extensive choice and a great quality of food (the smoked salmon was excellent) and again, a very nice staff to take care of you and especially Maggie who has been so nice with us\u2026 But, if I have to select one specific thing making of this hotel a very special place in HK, it would be the amazing terrace at the 37th floor named Pavilion. A huge perfectly designed space where you can enjoy a cocktail with the most beautiful views and a nice wind. We went there for a drink and we were so good we finally had a light dinner in a wonderful atmosphere, trendy, cool and relaxing. On the upper floor, there is even a pool, not so large, but very good and again with excellent views and a bar more and more popular in HK with a beautiful crowd. So, let\u2019s say this hotel is truly a great choice and for this quality, the rates are just impressive. For under HKD 1800 per night, this is a gift\u2026 There are just a few details to improve like a disagreeable smell in the lobby or an average quality of amenities but this is probably the best choice you can do in HK if you don\u2019t wanna make your bank account empty and find a place which is able to exceed the highest expectations.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "World", "Title": "\u201cDecent business hotel\u201d", "Author": "WorldAzntourist", "ReviewID": "UR79507416", "Content": "Crowne Plaza is a good choice if you travel for business in Hong Kong.

The bathroom is pretty clean and nice too with a rainshower and tub. Oh and the room even comes with a mobile phone (with local SIM card/number that you can bring around and have HKers contact you on). We used it to make restaurant reservations. But it's not as centrally located in Causeway Bay as hoped - it's a 7-10 min walk to an entrance of the Causeway Bay MTR station, and a bit more of a walk after that before you reach the main train platforms. Navigating the MTR and walk back was a bit of a downer after a long, tiring day pounding the streets. There's also no proper pedestrian crossing in front of the hotel and on top of 4-lane traffic, there's also a tram line running just outside. Friend and I were nearly run over by a tram (which came out of nowhere, we swear!) while attempting to jaywalk to our hotel. After that we stuck to the designated crossing 5 mins away. If you're lucky, you can even get a view of the Happy Valley race course (we were on the 19th floor and could see the track; albeit at a distance). Unfortunately, it wasn't race day during our stay.

We picked Crowne Plaza Causeway Bay mainly because they had connecting rooms and were able to guarantee them to us at booking rather than just subject to availability like most other hotels. Having connecing rooms meant that we had more liveable space. If we did not have them, we were likely to have spent time in one room and use the second only for baths and sleeping. I was able to get the rooms at my company's corporate rate HKD1100 per room per nite and it comes with free internet which was very helpful. The location: The hotel is a short walk from the Causeway bay MTR exit at Times Square. However, since there was 5 of us, we took cabs most of the time. We also wanted to conserve the energy of my 4 year old for the sight seeing activities rather than for walking to transportations. Taxi cost is very reasonable anyway. The rooms: The connecting rooms were cnfigured with one king connecting to a twin which worked fine for us and my little girls likes to share a bed with my husband and I. My 2 older boys had a room to themselves and could do anything they wanted in the afternoons even when their sister was taking her nap. The rooms were spacious and has a very nice comtemporary deco. Very pleasant and comfortable. The duvets were thick and comfy. My sons say that its the best they ever had. The rain shower in the bathroom was great. My boy enjoyed that too. The rooms we had no view and looked to other buildings, but we were not bothered. One of the best things that this hotel provide is City-wide mobile. We could take the mobile phones provided in each room out with us and can call room to room or back to the hotel at no charge. This was especially useful since we had 2 rooms, and my husband and I took a phone each and could get in touch with each other when we split up for our activities in Ocean park. The meals: We did not try the buffet breakfast since we felt that they were quite ex. We did orderd room service breakfast on one of the mornings. We had a local set and an American set. The food, especially the noodles, was way too salty. A breakfast at Tsui Wah, a local \"tea restaurant\" was much more satisfying and provided better value. The service: Conceirge was helpful and made reservations for us at Yung Kee. Other then that, my aunt who lives in HK and visited us on various occasions found the service staff lacking in warm and local knowledge. They were downright snooty on some ocassions, perhaps because she was very casually dressed and did not carry branded stuff?

They also did not attach a third room key when there were three paying guests in the room! On its website, it is stated that we could do a late checkout of up to 4pm. As my dad has walking diffculty, we wanted him to stay in the room for the last day since we were checking out only in the evening. However, when we checked with the reception, they insisted that we have to check out at 12 or pay an additional half day but the \"half day\" rate was equivilent to what we paid for our ONE day. It was the last straw. I've stayed in enough hotels to know that i deserve to be treated better. Crowne Plaza Hong Kong was a disappointment.

I couldn't wait to write a review on this place...Basically, I echo what everyone else says below--a great hotel, great rooms, great service....All around A+ property. It's a small footprint of a property, only 8-10 rooms per floor and a small lobby, but that doesn't take away at all from this full-service hotel...Main restaurant is a level up, with more hotel features a floor above that and a cool bar on the 28th floor. It's not the Peninsula or the Conrad, but for a upscale yet reasonable hotel, I've found myself a new home in Hong Kong. I pre-reserved an Club Floor standard room and was upgraded to a Deluxe room as a PC Platinum member. Knowing this is Hong Kong, the room pretty good size-wise, bigger than most in HK, but certainly not 'huge'. The bathroom is phenomenal, and the amenities in the room are tops--iPod hookup, 42\" flat-panel TV, and, if you choose, a cell phone in the room to take around town with you (I declined since I have a HK phone). The Club Level (Executive Floor) rooms are worth it, about HK400 more than a regular room. Includes internet access, a pretty good breakfast (served in their main restaurant) and the evening reception has some great food (enough for me for dinner most nights), great selection of booze, beers and soft drinks, and not all that crowded. The only thing different versus most executive floors was that the lounge is on the 2nd floor, slightly inconvenient all the way down and up in the elevators...But certainly not enough to detract from the overall quality of this property. I'll be back in HK two more times this year, and surely will book here again...I hate the hustle and bustle of Kowloon and their old and dated hotels. This is a new, modern, quiet property in an otherwise busy area--if you like a scene, Causeway Bay is nice, but the hotel is a great escape from it all...I hear nothing below me as I write this.

We booked 2 connecting rooms as we had a 3 year old and a 9 month old baby and were staying for a long period, but on arrival found the children's room stunk of smoke. After a little bit of confusion we were upgraded to a suite and the following day were also given a connecting room, so we had both a living area and 2 bedrooms (including 3 toilets!!). The decor was really nice, modern and not too 'hotel like' and the floor to ceiling windows gave lots of light. The rooms were very spacious, especially for HK, but then we did have lots of extra space, which we really appreciated! We ate breakfast at the hotel a few times which was fine, a reasonable selection, but we were sometimes charged for our 3 year old (they were inconsistent on this) which was a bit over the top as there was just a set price. We had room service lots of times and the quality varied depending on the dish, ironically the western style dishes (pasta, burger) were great, the Asian ones less so apart from the vege curry which was fantastic. Service was very friendly and generally helpful although sometimes language was a problem with a few restaurant staff only. The pool was lovely, although as the weather was unseasonably cold we only used it once! Gym although small was well equipped. The location is very handy, right next to Times Square and Lee Gardens shopping complexes, lots of restaurants etc and was very central for travelling to different parts of the island.

There's tons of space in the room considering the site and every conceivable thing is catered for - AV inputs for computer to 50\" LCD TV, iPod dock, surround sound (ok - I love gadgets!). The bathroom has a moveable bedroom wall which exposes the bathroom and also means you can see TV while taking a shower (yes - the bathroom speaker works great).
