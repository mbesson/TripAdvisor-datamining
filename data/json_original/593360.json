Got a room that stunk of smoke and then got stuck outside the hotel at 1am with -8 degrees cause the front door hadn't been fixed and you couldnt open it! No reception there and the \"Emergency\" phone number didnt work either!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for a detailed review read the rest. The place is very central and opposite the U Bahn that is very practical. Also very cheep for the size of the room and the quality of the hotel. Reception staff was ok too. Generally seems like a great option if you wanna visit Berlin and good value for money. BUT! The room stunk of smoke, it was awful. I hadn't asked for a smoking room and I got one that smelled really bad, I aired it and it still smelled. If you dont like this kind of surprises AVOID it! Worse thing was that the reception closes after 11pm. I was there for an event (work) and got back at 1am, the door outside wouldn't open. The electronic card worked perfectly but I stayed there for more than 10 minutes trying to open it, pulling hard etc but nothing happened. Now, I'm a girl, trying to get in a hotel at 1am in the night, with -8 degrees C, comletely freezing and trying to find a way to get inside. The doesn't have a lot of lights and because it's next to the U Bahn station it's kind of dodgy. There were some drunken and other weird people from really cheep bars across the street waking by that were worrying me too. They had a papaer on the door saying if you have a problem to call 2 numbers, one was for Emergency. I dialed it and it takes you through the reservations line, I was on it for more than 5 minutes and no one picked up.. what kind of emergency line is this!!!!!!!!!!!!! Lastly they had an other hotel that was one block away that you could walk to and ask for help, seems like it's affiliated to them. You had to walk past the dodgy bars to get there. The guy from the reception said the door is \"heavy\" and needs a strong pull and after I told him I was pulling for 10 minutes he mentioned that they're telling the hotel management to fix the door every day but they're not doing anything. I dont get it, we pay for our rooms and they cant take that money and FIX THE DOOR SO WE CAN GET TO OUR ROOMS???!!!! The guy was really tall and strong and even HE had trouble opening the door. I find it UNEXEPTABLE that a hotel doesn't fix the front door in such an area, and puts it's clients to risk . I would NOT RECOMMEND you go anywhere near this hotel, unless you reeeeallly dont care what will happen to you. There are other really cheep hotels near by that are better and cheep too, I just didn't know about them unfortunatelly.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Erfurt, Alemania", "Title": "\u201cStrong in every item\u201d", "Author": "Joakkin", "ReviewID": "UR123281170", "Content": "Nice hotel near to Potsdamer Platz.

I'm glad I didn't. I'm not saying people haven't had bad experiences here, but the wording of some of the ratings seemed to lean towards doing the utmost to put you off and ruin future custom for the Hotel. Our experience? Very, very good. Located right next the U2 line (and only a couple of hundred yards away from the central U1 line) it's ideal for getting all around Berlin. You could be in the city centre in about 10 minutes. We were made very welcome by the man on Reception when we arrived and the other staff we spoke to over the 5 days we stayed were also very pleasant. The room was on the 1st floor facing the station opposite, which meant if your curtains were open, people could see right into the room if they wanted to. Cleanliness of the room was excellent and it was large and spacious. Maid service was every day if you wanted. We expected it to be noisy, but it wasn't at all. The only down sides to the room? The lighting was a bit dim and there was no kettle. That was all. I'm sorry, but even that wasn't enough to persuade us this place was going to be verbally trashed on \"tripadvisor\". As far as the area goes? Yes, some people had commented on prostitutes hanging around the station at night and there were. About 5 or 6 of them, hardly throngs of them hassling you in the street. Not once did we feel unsafe in the neighbourhood day or night. It felt a lot safer than in the U.K!! We never had breakfast at the hotel (which was a buffet/continental at 7 Euros 50). There are plenty places only a couple of stops away on the U-Bahn where you can get it for 6 Euros or so. Go to Cafe Alex in the Sony Centre (Potsdamer Platz) and you can get all you can eat for 6.20 until about 11am. If you get hungry very late at night, go out the hotel door, turn right and literally opposite the LSD sex shop at Kurfursten Str (best way to describe where it is), there is a small take-away stall with a really friendly old guy and the food was excellent. Huge Durum chicken kebab for 3 Euros. 15-20 minutes walk in the other opposite direction, in a straight line, is an excellent Vietnamese restaurant situated right on a corner (sorry, can't remember the name of it). Nice and cheap, too. All in all, we would go back and stay here again. We would recommend it and what I would say to other previous reviewers who slated it is save up your money and stay in The Ritz or Hilton at Potsdamer Platz if that's the quality of accommodation you strive for.

Apparently, their booking system had broken down one day prior to my arrival, and therefor they had recieved an overwhelming (?) amount of bookings, which had led to a fully booked hotel and no room for me. All of this does sound a bit strange considering I had already gotten an e-mail confirming that my booking was recieved and everything was fine. Luckily (?), they managed to get me a room at Aldea Novum hotel (sister hotel), down the street. No costs came in addition. I find it strange that the hotel did not contact their future guests to inform them about the situation. To be given a message like this at the reception by a person who seems just as confused as I was, is not the best way to handle it.

Plus side - a truly huge duplex room that was clearly once amazing = virtually an apartment with two balconies HOWEVER..... Gym extra though not listed as such. 5euro per person per day!! When questioned two days later we got free access to it in the end, but only to find that it's virtually none existent = three non functioning machines and a switched off sauna. You need to warn them two hours before if you wish to use it!! The room itself was huuuuge, but very poorly maintained. Sockets hanging out of the wall, masses of wall switches that have no apparent function, useless totally ineffective aircon, no safe instructions, smelly furnishings and bedding, blinds broken, tissue thin curtains (and a LOT of windows making it impossible to sleep much past sunrise), and overall just a very very tired room at a chunky price. Add to that that it is on an incredibly busy road and the noise means that I have returned exhausted. Oh and did I mention the prostitutes working the streets outside? Didn't bother us, but all adds up. Additionally the duvets were tiny and two separate ones on a double bed? ...and the pillows un-usable. Room cleaning was minimal - we were there one day to witness how minimal. Dust bunnies under the bed, dirty furnishings etc. At one point pillowcase removed and not replaced? Bedroom had stained rugs and visibly dirty armchairs. The lounge had no ceiling lights, just free standing uplights. The bedroom had no bedside lights just an uplighter with a broken switch. The bed was positioned in front of units that meant they didn't open fully = just odd. Though to be fair masses of cupboards, but no hangers until asked. Downstairs the 'dining' area had badly stained carpets and a kitchen in a cupboard but no cups/kettle etc. When asked I was told not to use the kitchen as 'although it was there it mustn't be used as dangerous' and I quote!!! One of the two lifts was constantly out of order. They did supply a kettle though when asked and staff were pleasant if a rather ineffective. The station outside the hotel is shut btw - not the hotel's fault but inconvenient. Overall it's a great shame as it's just that this hotel does the absolute bare minimum. The gym should work and be accessible The blinds should work The electrics and lighting should be safe and work The kitchen should either be working or removed The curtains should block out light The windows should black out noise. You should be able to sleep in a hotel room. Not much to ask? Do not book this room as a treat or this hotel if you expect anything more than sleepless basic.

Berlin was quite some distance so when we had a long weekend decided to make the most of it and come visit. It was a straight forward 4 hour drive for us with not too many complicated turns until we hit Berlin! When we arrived, due to other peoples reviews we expected underground parking. This is not the case and the parking is now for the Bank. However there is free parking around the side of the hotel - and possibly under the railway line. We parked there no problems and the car was fine!! The hotel staff gave us a warm welcome and the dog and they helped ferry all of our kit up to our room for us and back from the room to the hotel! The hotel itself is basic. We had a double room for the two of us and out 1 year old chocolate labrador (She cost us an extra 10 euro's a night.) The room itself is basic, a kingsize bed (although you get 2 single duvets (What is that all about???) and 1 pillow each, you can ask for another, We also asked during our reservation for non feather pillows due to my allergies and these where provided.), a desk and chair, a single arm chair and footstool, wardrobe (with a safe in it, although we couldnt get ours working), 2 bedside tables, several lamps and a bathroom big enough to swing a cat (the dog enjoyed lying in there on the cool tiles after a long days walk). One downside of the bathroom was the shower cubicle itself is raised nearly 3/4 of a meter off the ground so when you step out you have to remember the drop is quite a lot otherwise you could smack you head on the sink as you fall. The shower itself is decent enough but could do with a clean - lots of limescale and build up. There are NO tea/coffee facilities which was a let down for me. There is also a tv with german tv, CNN and BBC World service. Also you have free WIFI which I am using to write this review from my chair (ask for the logon codes from reception). There are remnants of the old flats with telephones on the walls and there are electronic controls with a fan and temperature - unsure of what they did but made very little difference. The rooms where cleaned every day and bed made (with duvets put in a nice stylish way.) We also got clean towels every day (Even though we followed the sign on the wall and said we didnt by leaving them on the rail) as well as clean glasses, bins emptied and a general clean. Even though we asked for a courtyard room we still got a main road one and it is VERY VERY noisy!! The shops below are open 24/7 pretty much and you are in the heart of the turkish community! The roads itself are busy and there is constant traffic and germans beeping their horns all day and night (also a tradition if there is a wedding the procession will beep their horns the entire way too and from the church!) so we had to sleep with our windows shut the whole time which made it very stuffy. Luckily we had brought our own fan with us to keep us and the dog cool and that was on constantly. Our room although being a non smoking room still reaked of cigarettes from previous users. I had to clarify it was a non smoking room (despite there being an ashtray in the desk) and we had to have our windows open during the day otherwise when we came back the room smelt of cigarettes. We also got a spray of air spray to try and mask the smell from reception but it worked for a few hours then needed it again so we gave up in the end and left the windows open during the day and shut them at night. The breakfast itself in the hotel we cannot possibly comment on as we never ate in there as we felt 9.50 euros was extortionate. We got breakfast every morning from a lovely bakery at the Kufursten Strasse (green line) but there are enough cafes and bakeries opposite the hotel to eat in. This was only 5 mins walk away (as you head out the hotel turn right up potsdamer str. , under the red line bridge past lots of supermarkets and there on your right.) There are loads of supermarkets around and we went in and brought drinks and food - again something very difficult to get hold of during the day in the hotel and very expensive. They dont mind you taking up food etc to your rooms. The red line (station opposite the hotel) was out of action so we walked up to kufursten strasse line and got the train from there - very easy and machines to buy your tickets. We bought the Welcome to Berlin cards as that entitled us to travel round zone A and B and also discounts for many attractions (list from reception!) Around 16 euros each for 48 hours but Well worth it and we used ours so much! If you want to walk into the \"town\" where all the shops are its around 20-30 min walk up Bulow strasse onto Kleister Strasse where all the shops are. If you want to tube - take the kufursten Strasse tube and get off and Wittenburg platz. The shops are all up there as well as the many street tour buses for guided tours. Thats what makes this Hotel great to stay in as its really easy to get to most of the main attractions from here. The tubes are VERY busy and well used by the nationals and tourists and once you get the hang of them very easy and quick to use. Just be prepared to smell a lot of arm pits! We also went and visited the Zoo - again green line until Kufurstendam then orange line to Zoological gardens. we used our Welcome to berlin cards and got 25% off entrance. We spent around 6 hours in the park and saw most of the animals there. There are however no dogs allowed so we had to leave the dog in the hotel. We also used the tube to see Checkpoint Charlie, Brandenburg gate and Reichstag. It took around 2 hours of walking and a lot of train changes to get to all 3 (within a good walk of one another) but well worth the visit - we did plan to do the walking tour but missed it, so went off by ourselves. The brandenburg gate has some great toilets near by 50c for a 20 mins and the place automatically disinfects the walls, floor and toilet after every use - great for a germ-a-fobe like me! We ate at a restaurant on Potsdamer strasse about 1-2km walk away from the hotel and also had ice cream at the ice cream place on the corner near the hotel. We also ate in town at the hard rock cafe - thanks to Paul and the waiter (sorry cant remember his name). I would recommend booking though if you want to eat there, they make you wait 45 mins even though there is loadsss of tables free upstairs. They have lots of english speaking staff and menus in english so thats great. I would recommend you barely eat before going there portions are huge and we had a starter and couldnt finish our main which was a shame as we looked forward to dessert! We also ate at a place in the europa shopping centre in town - the bavarian restaurant on the bottom floor which was cheap and cheerful! Our dog had a wonderful time with all the walking we did and the staff in the hotel were very friendly and loved seeing her!! The previous owner had a chocolate labrador and so Indi was a reminder of that dog. They all made a fuss of her and wanted her around which was really nice.

There is a laundry room for which there is a one use fee of 5 Euro All things considered a good value for the price.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel at a reasonal price!\u201d", "Author": "Lillyvalley", "ReviewID": "UR39662263", "Content": "My husband and I were driving from UK to Berlin for the bank holiday weekend, and we of course needed a hotel that had a car park for our car, and centrally located. I ended up picking this hotel because the price was just right and it appears to be what we were looking for. When we arrived there.. we were given keys for the underground car park, which we were very pleased about, as we felt our car is parked safely and securely. We then checked in at the front desk, but our rooms weren't ready (this was a round 1.3pm), though it did say on our paper work that check in is 3pm. So we headed off to find a restaurant for food and then came back to the hotel, in which we were told our room is now available to us. To our surprise, when I opened the door to our room, the first thing I noticed is the space of the room, lovely large, clean, and airy... with huge windows... although looking over the main road.. it's very well insulated and so you cannot really hear the traffic. The double bed was great, and there's a desk and flat screen TV there. The bathroom ensuite was clean with towels (no bath) but it id have a shower, and as were there for the weekend only that didn't bother us. Around the hotel there are quite a number of restaurants and few supermarkets to buy things, and the best thing about this hotel is that the S bahn is right opposite the hotel just less than a min walk away. just absoultely great for exploring the city... if you don't want to blow your budget! Added bonus was that the staff were helpful and were able to to speak English too..... just had a great time!", "Date": "September 3, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel City B", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d593360-Reviews-Hotel_City_B-Berlin.html", "Price": "$63 - $1,320*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Potsdamer Strasse 129</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Ecke Bulowstrasse, ex.
