My friend and I had found this hotel to offer one of the lowest prices for a room in the Magnificent Mile shopping area. Overall, this was a nice hotel with friendly staff, and was in close proximity to many Chicago must-sees, including the famous 'bean' and Michigan Avenue shopping and restaurants. Pros -Check-in and Check-out were quick and efffortless. My friend and I asked to be put on a higher floor with a nice view, and he was able to meet both requests without a problem. -The room was large, clean, and had an excellent view of the Michigan Avenue bridge, the 'green' river (as it was right after St. Patrick's day), and iconic buildings and shops. The room had a modern feel and offered complimentary wifi. -The concierge staff were both friendly and helpful. We were given excellent dinner recommendations and easy-to-follow directions to our restaurant of choosing. The concierge in the morning was also able to point us in the right direction for the breakfast bagels we were craving! -We enjoyed a few drinks in the Angels and Kings bar located in the hotel, and it had a nice atmosphere. -The location is a few blocks from Michigan Avenue shopping in one direction, and about three blocks away from Millenium park and 'the bean' in the other direction. Cons -The only real con was lack of self-parking available at the hotel. The only option offered was to pay $50.00 for valet parking, or find your own self-parking a few blocks away. My friend and I, in an effort to save some money, decided to scope out self-parking (which we found one block away) and haul our luggage back to the hotel. While this was somewhat annoying, the self-parking was only $38.00 for 24 hours, so we saved some money. Overall, I would stay here again, given the lower rates than some of its competitors closer to the Michigan Avenue shopping.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cYour Staff ROCKS!\u201d", "Author": "Luv2BTravelling", "ReviewID": "UR126434986", "Content": "The staff at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is *amazing*! I have to admit...I have *never* known hotel staff to be so accommodating! I was a bit frazzled when I arrived, due to a fender bender on the freeway, but your staff made me feel as if I was truly THE most important person in the world and they took care of me from the start! They were friendly, welcoming, caring and WONDERFUL! (I can't even begin to tell you how much that means to me!) After feeling relieved to make it there (after a tough drive)...I was met by a charming, young valet, who made the whole valet process seem SO easy and he eased my mind considerably! The lovely woman at the front desk made the check-in process seem so easy and even if my room was still being prepared ...I felt that she truly cared about my experience and she put my mind at ease as well! I went to Angels & Kings to have a quick drink...and the friendly bartender was very helpful, as he made me aware of what he had available. I also asked him if he would kindly open the bottle of wine that I brought, since I had forgotten a corkscrew and he gladly did so! He also made sure I had a couple of wine glasses. I wish I could remember their names, but I've forgotten now. I arrived at approximately 4:00 p.m. 3-15-12 and left the next day, so that should help identify them. In addition, the room was lovely and the views of Chicago were *magnificent* from every window! (I stayed in a Tower Suite.)

After all, isn't it advertised to have hosted celebs and rock stars? Located on centrally located Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago, the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is housed in the iconic Carbide & Carbon building, a historic Burnham masterpiece fashioned from green terra cotta and black polished granite. I couldnt wait to check in. I walked into a strange, narrow passageway known as the Lobby. Angels and Kings lounge anchors one end, while a somewhat empty room facing Michigan Avenue holds a not-for-championship play billiards table. The drab, utilitarian front desk and facing Concierge station are dimly lit even during the day. An oddly out of place, has-not-been-cleaned-in-who-knows-when, bar with only two stools sat outside of Angels and Kings. So far, not good. There was literally nothing going on in or around the lobby or sidewalk area, so the hotel was obviously relatively empty. I checked in on a Sunday afternoon in a non holiday, cold and dreary time of the year. Given the less than capacity status, I requested a courtesy upgrade to a Tower room, which was denied. I did get an end/corner room on the 21st floor with 4 windows, which was nice. It faced the rear of a really ugly old building on one side, and I could look into the rooms of what appeared to be either a lower priced office building or tiny apartments on the other side. The room's windows had shades plus decorator cool grey wool flannel drapes, which kept out the light at night and early morning hours. It was clean and furnished in an Art Deco motif, but the mattress was probably from the era of the Nixon Administration, and was quite tattered and far from luxurious. There was one ugly framed black and white photo of a man I didnt recognize on the wall and a mirror above the bed. Stepping off the elevator onto the 21st floor was like stepping into an ugly warehouse. Scarred walls, nondescript paint and no hint of decoration on the entire floor. The doors to the rooms looked like they had been lifted from a salvaged building, and the carpeting could not have been a worse choice. Apparently meant to resemble the pattern of sound wave, it fell short of any sort of musical quality. Dirty dishes and glasses with something disgusting resembling vomit sat outside of a couple of the rooms for a day and a half. Housekeeping pointed the finger at the In-Room Dining Department, and someone finally removed them from the hallway. The Hard Rock Hotels advertise that every floor is dedicated to a musician or group. The 21st floor of The Hard Rock Chicago must have been a nod to a one hit One-Der, which was never seen or heard from again. Nothing at all like the floor where the Executive Offices and business room are located -- which displays a huge photo of Mick Jagger on one wall and a giant shadowbox holding a suit and a title card indicating it to have been worn by Keith Richards directly across the room. I presumed that floor was where business conferences are held, and those companies paying big bucks to impress invited attendees need something to justify the rental fees. The Angels and Kings Lounge boasted having your photograph turned into a mug shot, which would then be projected onto the wall first seen when entering the lounge. I didn't quite see the excitement in projecting one's self as a felon on the way through criminal processing at the Cook County slammer. An Asian restaurant was featured in the in-room guide to the Hotel, which apparently closed down some time ago. Electric guitars can be 'borrowed' by guests, to the tune of a $500 hold/deposit on your credit card. There is no pool, and no guest hot tub. There is a gift shop down the ramp from the Lobby, featuring supremely overpriced Hard Rock themed clothing, jewelry and other souvenier quality items for tourists too lazy to explore the exciting shops Chicago proper has to offer. A huge sign on the window of the Hard Rock facing Michigan advertised rooms for $99/night. For a moment I wondered if The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago was really just a front for a YMCA. I sure wish I had gotten that $99 deal. Unfortunately, it still would have been too much. The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is like a has-been starlet of a certain age, trying to project an image from the cool rock days of the 80s. Sadly, in harsh daylight its just an older hotel desperately in need of a facelift. No wonder the front desk staff seems so down.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "oxfordshire", "Title": "\u201cRecent stay - wonderful\u201d", "Author": "cuddles55", "ReviewID": "UR125792684", "Content": "Ny hubby and I have just returned from a 5 night break to Chicago where we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel - we had a wonderful time staying there although a sour note to finish was being presented with a bar bill for two large bottles of water ( costing $9.60 each!!!!) which we never had and we didn't even open the mini bar/fridge in the room for the whole stay ( as we had read from a previous reviewer about the 'movement sensors in the bar/fridge,') When I queried this bill at reception, I did get the bill cleared, with no actual apology but with the words 'Oh, I suppose I have to trust you'!!!!!

The hotel itself was very 'rock star': everything was black, grey or dark purple and dark. Our room and bathroom were decent sized; the furnishings were sparse but fit the theme. We had a corner room on the 7th floor with nice views of the skyline. The room service was also good, not exceptional but satisfying. Since neither of us play guitar, we did not take advantage of the free Fender rental; I was too nervous about breaking it to attempt it. The drawback with the hotel was noise; the doors allow for noise to come through and street noise was audible.

I ended up booking a room at the Hard Rock on-line, a prepaid nonrefundable rate that was the best I found for the date I needed. Well, the week of the show, the Manilow concert got rescheduled to July due to medical reasons! So here I sat with a reservation and train tickets and no show to go to with my sister who ended up not wanting to go to Chicago and spend additional money she didn't have. I had called the hotel to see if there was any way I could get the reservation switched to July, realizing it was nonrefundable. Although it was against their policy, they were willing to assist me due to the circumstances. However, the July rate would have been close to $100 more than the February rate, and since a lot could happen between now and then, I chose not to accept their offer. I called them back to leave the message. Then within a few minutes, I received a call at home thanking me for keeping the existing reservation! Long story short, my husband came to Chicago with me instead of my sister, just for a quick overnight getaway, so as not to waste the prepaid room. Upon check in at rush hour traffic on Friday afternoon, we were upgraded to a \"city view room\" without asking and at no additional charge. The demeanor of the desk clerk was fantastic and he made us feel very welcome. It is a very historic, tall and narrow building, and our \"city view\" ended up being on the 18th floor with two windows looking directly into the windows of buildings across the streets, but the third corner window overlooked the Chicago river with a great view of the \"corn cob\" towers as well. I agree with some other reviews about the \"darkness\", but I think that is due to the primarily gray color scheme of the halls and rooms along with heavy drapes. However, there were plenty of lights in the room, a fantastic lounge chair with built in footstool and a brand new Rolling Stone magazine, as well as a huge bathroom with nice amenities. We thought about eating at the hotel, but unfortunately, the China restaurant had recently closed and we didn't have the opportunity to check out Angels and Kings, but the location of the hotel is great for walking the State Street shopping district or heading to Millennium Park or the \"museum campus\". There are certainly plenty of eating options within easy walking distance as well.

The lobby has a modenist design with chairs and couches spread though out. The carpets have a great design with soundwaves printed on them. Each floor is named after a musician and has a great mural of them on a wall and has a case with some memorbilia as well. We were given a 19th floor room which was impeccably clean. The room had a great vibe with sleek stylish funiture and comfortable queen bed. The little reading lights above the bed were a nice touch. I like to read at night and my wife is a light sleeper and they didn't bother her at all. The same chic vibe continued to the bathroom with modern fixtures and lighting. It was a shower only with no tub which is fine for my wife and I. The shampoo and shower gels were particularly good. So, good that my wife went down to the Hard Rock Shop and puchased a full sized shower gel for home. The only drawback to the room in general was the shower couldn't be closed all the way. It had a half plane of glass that couldn't be closed so it was off putting but by no means a reason not to stay there again. If anything it was that I just wasn't used to the design. A note about parking. Valet is $50 a night and there is limited self parking that's about a half block away and $35 a night. Now, this is standard for Chicago and while high it's something that you'd have to pay no matter where you stay. Overall, I would definitely stay here again.

Not sure that we would stay at the property again when choosing a four star hotel. Here are our thoughts: The Good: Location of the hotel was excellent, we could walk pretty much anywhere we wanted to go in downtown Chicago, and the train station was just about four blocks away for more distant locations. Lots of good to great restaurants nearby. The bed was comfortable and had enough pillows. The second room we were in (an upgraded corner King for an additional $30 per night) was large and had four large windows with a great view of the river. The room was quiet, hardly ever heard any noise from the hallway at all. All staff members we interacted with were helpful, friendly and enthusiastic, particularly the concierge. The Bad: While the bed was comfortable, the sheets were not great, a little too small and kind of cheap for a four star. The towels also weren't great - kind of scratchy and thin. The rooms (we saw two) could definitely use some refurbishing. The furniture and walls were definitely showing their age. There were dings, scratches, crumbling corners, etc. everywhere. Bar none, this was the most \"petite\" closet ever. Where do people put their shoes???? The bathroom. We were speechless when we first walked in and it got worse from there. Our room was handicap enabled, so the shower had no barrier at all from the rest of the room. There were loose tiles and missing grout (I mean a LOT of missing grout, not just a couple of little spots), plus a lot of the grout that was still in place looked dirty. The magnifying mirror on the wall didn't light up and also wouldn't stay in place (drooped downwards) so it was essentially useless. There was extremely limited counter space and no towel bar (other than the handicap rail next to the toilet), so after washing your hands you had to step across the room to get to a hand towel. The toilet seat wouldn't stay up when needed, it would slam down. Not cool for the hubby..... The room was not very clean. For instance, we had a spiderweb in the corner, and when hopping up on the bed to put my mascara on (there was a mirror over the bed), the top of the headboard looked as though it hadn't been cleaned for quite a while. I am not a neat freak but really don't like a dirty hotel room. Yuck. The maids never replenished our bath products. Usually they leave extra, especially when people tip but we didn't get replacements. I would have liked more lotion for the dry weather. The lack of shampoo/conditioner didn't matter to us, since there wasn't enough water pressure for me to wash my hair anyway. My hair is long and thick and it would have taken about 1/2 hour to rinse out in that shower. So all in all, I would have to say that we probably would not choose to stay at this property again unless it was refurbished and we had a different type of bathroom. We had a great time because we chose to focus on the positives and enjoyed each other's company and the great city of Chicago.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGood Location, Nice Clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "kt1980_98", "ReviewID": "UR121454944", "Content": "Stayed at the Hard Rock for my hudband's work party.

We stayed at the Hard Rock Chicago this past weekend while we were there for the Chicago Marathon. Let's start with the pro's- Great location- a few blocks from where the marathon start was, cool theme, nice employees. Con's- First night there we were exhausted from a full day of travel but couldn't sleep a wink, even 14 floors up all you could hear were sirens, car horns and traffic. The rooms were virtually like being on the ground floor with all of the noise. The room was hot the whole time we were there, we would turn down the AC and come back and it was turned back up, couldn't get it cooled off. The beds were not only uncomfortable, but dirty. What I thought was a folded sheet at my feet turned out to be no sheet at all, no mattress pad, just the stained, dirty, mattress. Neither of our beds had real mattress pads (just some weird, dirty thing that didn't cover the whole mattress), or fitted sheets, just a flat sheet that may or may not cover the whole bed... but we didn't realize this until the 2nd night when we actually looked down under the sheets to see what was going on. I called the front desk, told them that we needed to have the bed linens changed, they were polite but didn't act like it was a big deal at all. The housekeeper that came up was very nice and changed both beds. After further inspection we don't think the sheets had been changed in a while. YUCK! We were thoroughly disgusted, so again, no sleep. They didn't even have duvet covers, they just wrap the duvet in 2 flat sheets, not sure how sanitary this is. Needless to say, we couldn't wait to get home to our own bed. On top of them being dirty, they were the most uncomfortable beds we've slept in.

A colleague chose the hotel. The convention room rate was $199/night, which I did not think was worth the value of the hotel. The lobby is hip, like everything related to the Hard Rock. Guitars behind the front desk and music playing in the lobby are expected. The desk staff was friendly, and I was even allowed to check in rather early. My room had two queen beds, a long desk/dresser area and a small refrigerator. The room size was comfortable, although the lighting in general was inadequate in my opinion. I could work at the desk just fine, but otherwise I felt like I was in a cave. The entry area around the closet was very dark. There was a mirror on the wall above the beds' headboards, but it was more decorative than practical. The lighting in the bathroom was also bad, and it was hard to see what I was doing. (My eyesight is very good.) There is a full-length mirror on the closet door, but there is barely any light around it to see yourself in the mirror. While some may view the room decor as having a certain style, I felt that it was just a thin facade. When I returned to the room after a long day, I didn't get that feeling of being somewhere to relax and unwind. It's not that a hotel room has to feel just like home, but this room didn't make me feel like a welcomed guest. The elevators were slow. I had to wait several minutes (up to 10 minutes one time) before a car arrived. Internet access cost $14/day. Wired and wireless was offered, and I used the wired access because the wireless coverage was spotty. The hotel location is good, being on Michigan near Wacker. But overall, I felt the room rate was far from being a reasonable value for the room itself. My stay itself was fine. The staff was helpful. The bed was comfortable. The rock n' roll memorabilia decor throughout the hotel is interesting. But given a choice I would stay somewhere else in Chicago; and in fact I did. I needed to stay two more nights and I booked those nights at the Club Quarters Central Loop for $30/night less (and wireless Internet was free). There's nothing really wrong with the Hard Rock. Perhaps other rooms have better lighting or are more inviting. I could stay here again, but I thought the room rate was comparatively too high and the general feel was not inviting.

Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is a beautiful hotel, and the rooms do not disappoint.

They charge you $13.50/day for internet, but if you book directly with the Hard Rock website, this charge is apparently waived. I gave this property a poor rating because of the facility response to an incident that occurred during my stay. I was woken up by a group of rowdy teenagers at 4 am on my last night staying there. I guess they had multiple rooms because there was loud music, screaming, and doors banging repeatedly. I called the front desk to complain and get them to shut the *ell up, and I was told that someone would be right up. Someone did not arrive until 5:50 am and broke up their little hotel party. I had an early flight home the next morning, and I reported the incident at checkout. The clerk said that they noticed this group of kids in the lobby, but didn't know what floor they were on because no one had called to complain...what bull. After I told him that I had called to complain after being woken up at 4 am, his attitude immediately changed to, \"Oh well we always send someone up right away when we get complaints.

But the fact that all five of us - including 3 teenage daughters - had to get to ready for the wedding with one tiny mirror above the sink in the bathroom left us with a dissatisfied opinion of this hotel. After five hot showers and three curling irons/ blow dryers on the tiny sink counter, we had a very difficult time squeezing in to get ready. At one point I even burned my foot so bad after climbing over the cords and knocking one of them off the counter, I could barely wear my shoes to the wedding! The obvious fact that we were a family of five sharing one room, should have alerted the check-in staff to give us an appropriate room.

The building used to be the old Carbide and Carbon headquarters (now a part of Dow Chemical). The decor in the lobby and rooms certainly have a unique feel to them in that they are music inspired. The atmosphere in the hotel feels more like it is one of Elvis's rooms than a true hotel - and this gives it a special feeling. If you walk out the doors, you're right on Michegan Avenue, close to Millenium Park and the Magnificent Mile. Your location couldn't be better!

It actually wasn't even two days since I arrived one morning and departed maybe 28 hours later. But, it was enough to give me a taste of the Hard Rock Hotel. Appearance/Lobby: The Hard Rock is in a building that once was used for something else, for sure. There are entrances on both streets that it corners. One is the main entrance, and the other is a side entrance where the elevators and the shop are. The lobby is streamlined, spare, but there are plenty of places to sit and wait for people, meet, converse, etc. There is a little lounging area with a couple of computers off the main lobby. Location: The location couldn't be better! I loved that I could walk to Grant Park, get Garrett Popcorn, easy easy access to the El and transportation. All kinds of things around the neighborhood, too - restaurants, bars, shops. Services/amenities: Great services. Any question I had, the staff had an answer for, and a friendly one at that. They lent me an umbrella when I needed to walk somewhere in the rain. They knew the area, knew the best places to go, were handy with a map, etc. Free wifi in the rooms (they give you an access card), great concierge service. There are a couple of computers in the lobby so you can check email etc. while you wait for people, without having to go to a business center. I really like the 'try a guitar' service, too - there is a menu with electric and acoustic guitars and you can choose one (free!) and it will be yours in your room, for the duration of your stay. There are lessons too, but they aren't free, I don't think, and I wasn't there long enough to try them. Just don't break it or you could be out lots of money - these babies are valuable! I'm told there's a gym but I wasn't there long enough to use it or even check it out. There is a shop with lots of stuff in it, it's not cheap! Rooms: Not enormous, but plenty of space for me. I had a king bed, which provided a fantastic sleep! There is a room safe, a flat screen with the requisite dozens of channels (but I didn't watch TV the entire time I was there). Each floor has a name, and I was on the Elvis floor. There were costumes and guitars of Elvis throughout the floor, and you could go on the other floors and see museum-style displays of the others. I didn't check them all out but I did see the Madonna Floor. There was a chair, and a very long \"desk\" - sort of a combination of table and desk that spanned the sleeping area. The shampoo, conditioner, soap and shower gel were all great - they use a good provider of these things. The ironing board I wasn't thrilled with - someone mentioned this in a previous post and I kind of shrugged it off, but it turns out they were right. Very thin cover and you can feel the bars/grates through it, and when you iron your garment takes on the pattern of the ironing board grating because the cover isn't thick enough. This is the only negative I can think of in my stay, though. Food and Drink: There was a restaurant that looked nice and I was planning to try it but ended up going out with colleagues - that good access to everything again! Before dinner and after, we had drinks in the bar, which was pretty good. It got really crowded and there was live music, which was great. The drinks were pretty good, although not the most consistent - I had one Bloody Mary that was so nasty I couldn't even drink it, not sure what on earth they put in that, but it was not like the previous few! The live music (also free) was a great touch - it was like being in a club, at a destination, but without the snootiness and it was free and I didn't have to go anywhere for it! Conference services: I didn't plan the conference so I can't speak to the ease of organizing anything, but there were a number of rooms on the conference floor, and it seemed that the room was an excellent size for the participants, it was set up well, etc.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201ca great stay!\u201d", "Author": "aestho-nomics", "ReviewID": "UR113240936", "Content": "i have always liked music themed places, so this was definitely something i'd planned to do at some point. the hotel was good, the service was fine, just that there is nothing very special about the regular city view rooms as all the fancy things are all reserved for the suites etc. nonetheless, great weekend, would love to be back!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cEXTREME\u201d", "Author": "baludwiguwm", "ReviewID": "UR113103011", "Content": "Stayed in the Extreme Suite for one night while I was staying downtown with friends.

Both bedside lamps did not work when we arrived in the room, but an employee was sent up immediately to replace the bulbs, so that was an impressive response. We were also granted a late check-out without any hassle, as well. (Although, the \"front desk\" button on our phone somehow went directly to housekeeping, and they were a bit rude and obviously irritated that we reached them both times that we made a call from the room.) The walls in this hotel are very thin, we were woken by a screaming baby at 5:30 in the morning, and heard those wails for the next several hours. We could also hear everyone's conversations as they passed our room in the hall. We didn't mind as we weren't there for a relaxing weekend, but I wouldn't recommend this hotel for anyone who wants peace and quiet. You can hear everything going on around you.

I scored this great deal on Travelzoo $109 which included an upgrade (that I didn't have to mention at check-in - they were THAT good!). The lobby is not that breathtaking (like the Palmer House Hilton that I happened to walk into) - but the Hard Rock room is better (as per my friend who stayed at the Hilton).

Better than a Westin Heavenly Bed. No wonder I heard Kim Kardashian stole a Hard Rock pillow! I did not hear anyone making noise in their room - only once when some partiers were making noise in the hallway returning to their room. The only thing if I had to say is that the corridors and carpets there need to be updated (which they probably are in the process of doing) as there is significant wear and tear.

I think this past stay will sadly be my last. The hotel itself is fine and the recent renovations helped out a ton. The carpets used to be filthy and the walls were not much better. Now they are looking much more in line with what you would expect from a hotel of this class. That's really what it comes down to, class. When I stay at what aspires to be a 4 star hotel I have higher expectations than I do when I stay at a Hilton Garden Inn. This hotel has failed me as a guest several times. Here are some low lights from this past stay: -Mold in the bathroom. I stayed in room 603 and there was black mold and mildew on the tiles in the shower. It was in plain sight and is probably still there. Was it running wild and dripping from the ceiling? No, of course not but it was there and it shouldn't have been. Did I bring this to the front desk's attention? At a hotel like this should I have to? -The cover for the ironing board looked like it had been there since the hotel opened. Again, is this a huge deal, no but come on! You spend thousands upgrading each of these rooms and you don' think to replace the cover on the ironing boards. Also when you when you iron a shirt on a board with a worn out cove the grate lines from the ironing board start showing up on your shirt. -The sheets for the bed were like cardboard. Seemed clean but felt cheap. -The coup de gras! No hot water for my morning shower. We got a notice that they would be working on the pipes and our water would be off from 2:00am-3:00am. I woke up at 7:00am and went to take a shower...no hot water. I did call about this one. The front desk staff informed me that \"they had been getting calls all morning\" and apparently something went wrong with a valve. This was understandable, but not necessarily forgivable since a clean bed and hot shower are the basic pillars of any hotel stay. The cold shower did not make me a happy camper. Let's fast forward to checkout. I go down and the lobby is empty and there is no other guest in line or at the desk. There are 3 people behind the desk including the manager. I tell them I'm checking out of 603. Without a hello or how ya doin they hand over my bill. Here ya go anything else I can help you with? Hmmm, how about asking me how my stay was? Since when is it not common practice to ask how your stay was? ( I guess when you know that the response will be anything but flattering you avoid the question) Am I expecting some sort of retribution from the hotel? Of course I am! They didn't provide me with the stay that they promised so they should give me something back. Did I raise hell to get that something? No, again should I have to? did they even care? No they didn't. While I'm sure they will pretend to now, it's a little too late for that. While I'm sure i'll get some response now that I posted this about how sorry they are about the less than stellar experience I had and they assure me this is not the norm and they will look into this, and blah, blah , blah, but will anything change?...no it won't.

Cleanliness and service are what is important to me. On both scales I would rate the Hard Rock as quite poor. When checking in there was only one person at the registration desk and we was overwhelmed because not only did he have people registering but he repeatedly had to answer the phone to deal with guests. There was a sign at the desk highlighting the hotel's remodeled rooms, I asked the person registering if it was possible to get one on the remodeled rooms. The registrar said he would see what he could do. Needless to say the registration process was interrupted by several phone calls. ( I had booked the room because I colleague had selected the hotel so I wanted to be in the same hotel as him. I was booked for an upgraded room. ) The room I received was not remodeled. I understand that he may not have been able to accommodate my request, but it would have been nice if he had told me rather than ignoring my requests. When I stepped off the elevator, the floors are painted in dark colors giving a dank and dungeon like feel which is amplified by very little lighting. The darkness, however, could not hide the carpet mottled with stains. Entering my room things were little different than the hallway. The Carpet is dotted with stains throughout the room and fraying in several places. The walls and furniture are marked up and chipped. There is a small standing wardrobe tucked in an alcove instead of a closet which barely fits two suits and an overcoat. There are two small drawers for clothes. Overall the room is average size but is in very poor condition. Given the state of the carpet, I was happy to have my own slippers because of the filthy carpet but also because no slopers were provided. No robe was provided so I had to call to get a robe sent up. For people use to nice down comforters, there is a comforter on the bed but it is pile filled and quite dated looking. the rooms look and feel dirty which makes any stay feel unpleasant. I used the fitness center. It also is tired and dated. Some equipment seemed to not function properly. They had plenty of towels but oddly the had earphone cover pads but no headsets. Itis in the basement and the motif is dark with a dungeon like feel. As to the service this confirmed my belief that financially the hotel is having difficulty. The service quality is terrible and the hotel is operating with minimal staff. I had a hint of this when I checked in and my assumption was confirmed throughout the stay. When I called room service no one picked up the phone. I tried again allowing it to ring for many minutes. No one picked up. I called the front desk and was told someone from room service would call me back. After waiting, I called room service again finally someone answered. Another example of poor service was that I had to request twice to have a package that was sent to me delivered to my room. The next day after a day of meetings I returned to my room at 4:00 and discovered that my room was still not cleaned. A minute after I entered the room, I hear a knock. I expected the maid, but rather I was greeted by the person checking the minibar. Clearly filling the minibar is more important than cleaning the rooms. I asked if he could send someone to clean the room. He assured me they would, but of course after waiting I had to call housekeeping to get a maid sent up. The service quality of the hotel is poor and indicative of a hotel that is understaffed. My guess is that the Hard Rock is having financial difficulties. It may be confined to this property but the condition of the hotel and the poor service indicate to me that they are cutting corners. I would not recommend staying here.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel & restaurant.

The historical building is simply beautiful and the overall decor gives it a special feeling. Rooms are quite standard for this kind of hotel without above average amenities or accessories. In terms of room floor space it tends to be on the smaller side if you are in regular room. Beds are simply GREAT! one of the best ones we have ever had in a hotel. Downturn is the closet, it is minuscule! It cannot even handle one person's stuff, much less four people. We had to keep our stuff in the bags for our 5 days stay, because there were not so many drawers neither. When we checked in, we were given a room that smelled terrible as being a smoking room (it actually wasn't), we immediately went over to reception and the nice lady apologized and gave us an updated room for that night.

This was a 5-day conference; I checked out 2 days early. For any sensitive sleepers out there (say you wouldn't appreciating housekeeping pounding on your neighbor's door at 10:30 PM to ask if he's going to check out yet that night), I would suggest a different hotel. Don't bother to ask the desk clerk for any solutions either. Also - this is ironic and will become more evident as you keep reading - there's an one inch gap under the door. Not only does this make soundproofing IMPOSSIBLE, but it also allows boat loads of light to filter in at night (a wash cloth over the lighted alarm and a tissue box in front of the TV's clock fixed those problems). Thus, I stuffed pillows beneath the door to decrease the light. Back to the light irony: the light filtering beneath the door is probably the most light you'd get in the room. I understand mood lighting, but reading for more than 20 minutes in the room was frankly intolerable. Talk about eye strain. Also, if you're a female, the \"lighted\" make-up mirror in the bathroom is inadequate. It might make it as a night light for my three year old. On the upside, this hotel is in downtown Chicago, directly on Michigan and Lake. I got parking around the corner on Lake (60 E. Lake) for $31/night. Free Internet access is available in the lobby area only (not in the room). There's a restaurant on-site (Chinese), which I did not try as Houlihan's was right around the corner.

The hotel was selected for me and the price was a bit over $200 per night. Location: Right on Michigan Ave. Great if you are in town for sightseeing or business. If you want to get around town on the 'L' it's a short walk up Wabash to the station. There are some restaurants in the area. We ate at the Emerald Loop and found it to be good. Check-in: Relatively fast. My room selection was correct. No problems. Room: 19th floor. Generally well decorated and laid out. The room has a flat screen TV. Unfortunately the TV stopped working on Thursday of my stay. Rather disappointing. But since I was checking out the next day, it wasn't worth it to call a technician. Bathroom was clean, although the shower head didn't hold its position very well. It would slip and forced me to stand almost against the wall to get water. There is in-room internet, but it costs $10 or so a day to use it. I really hate hotels that still charge for internet. It's like having an extra tax slapped on you. Hotel: The property is in the old Carbide & Carbon Building. Its an older building and when you first walk in, the Art Deco Interior screams at you. The lobby itself is modern. Bar on the first floor. Once inside the renovated areas, you get all of the rock star kitsch hanging about. There is an internet station with two computers in the lobby to print boarding passes and check email. The computers are always being used, probably because of the in-room charge. There is a Chinese restaurant that serves breakfast in the morning. I think it was about $18 for the breakfast buffet. OK, not fantastic. Small selection of hot food with a bread/pastry stand. Its not laid out well for a buffet and can be tough to get around if there are more than a few people milling about. Service: OK. I typically don't want maid service until I need things tidied up. But there wasn't a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign around. So I called the front desk and told them that I wouldn't need housekeeping. When I got back, I found that housekeeping had been in the room. So I had to call down for a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign. On one of the days, my 7:30 wake up call was really late. Fortunately the alarm on my IPhone woke me up. But that's not something that I consider to be acceptable. Overall: I just wasn't impressed. My company paid good money and I think I could have done better elsewhere. The TV breaking down was just the last thing in a line of events that gave me pause. I strongly recommended to other colleagues headed out to Chicago that they should choose another property.

It was a Monday morning and I inquired about early check-in (by 2 hours), and was told I'd have to pay an additional $49. I practically lived at Radisson for business, and could check in whenever I wanted. You need an obscure code for their internet even when plugged into the hardline in your room, and they charge $9.95 for 24 hours of \"VIP service.\" I have no idea what is VIP about being able to access the Internet in a hotel room in the year 2010... I had no problem getting online at the Country Inn I stayed at in Kentucky a few weekends ago... believe me, there was nothing VIP about that. Furthermore, your connection abruptly times out at 24 hours... even if you are staying for multiple days like I was. Where they saved on their archaic internet connection sign in process, they splurged on a high tech Pink Panther style mini bar, which is kept in a drawer. In fact at first glance it is so understated, you have no idea it is a mini bar and not just a small array of complimentary snacks (no pricing or note that you will be charged). This is where it gets really fun.... if you just pick an item up to look at the caloric content, you get charged for it, because they have a high-tech weight-sensor under each item... as though it is the Golden Jubilee. Apparently the Hard Rock loses millions of dollars a year in snickers. I don't know. The place IS cool. If I could fit the ultra luxe wool curtains in my bag I would (don't worry Hard Rock, they're still right where you hung them). The bath items were very nice, too... although like the previous reviewer wrote, the lights are dim! I don't mind that night-club lighting, but it would have been nice to have the option to turn up the light, or at least be provided with a vanity light so I could see my face up close, which is important for men & women alike. Also like the last reviewer wrote, the walls are paper thin. Luckily I was tucked away down a hall and only heard a few early morning door slams. At night I heard someone rustling through their purse to find their room key. I can't imagine coming to this place to for a romantic getaway... if you catch my drift. What it's probably good for?

Rock music and videos throughout the main lobby created an upbeat atmosphere. Check in was a breeze. We were travelling with teenaged kids so requested (and were given) rooms adjacent to each other at check in. Each floor is decked out in rock and roll memorabilia. We were fourtunate to be on Prince's floor (rooms 1606 and 1607). The rooms are large and comfortable. The bathrooms were modern, spacious and clean. Again, the feeling is contemporary. These rooms had a great view of the river and Chicago Tribune building between the adjacent properties. Our KISS themed bath was a favorite of our kids (theirs was STING). The complementary Hard Rock shower products were awesome. Unfortunately, they are not for sale. The hotel is directly accross from Millenium Park and an easy walk to world class restaurants and shopping. From this location we were able to walk to the aquarium, field museum, navy pier, and many other attractions. The Chicago Architecture Foundation river cruise is a block away and not to be missed.

You are in the heart of everything if you stay here. Almost everything is within walking distance. We even got to see the blackhawk parade from our room, which was a once in a lifetime experience. I went through a third party website and found cheaper rates. If you go through hard rock and you have AAA, make sure you say it up front. You get free breakfast with a AAA membership. Glitches of the hotel - Out of 4 days we had to flag down our own cabs, except one time. We arrived at 9pm to the hotel and were told they overbooked the rooms and we had to get a smoking room when we requested a non-smoking. We were comped 2 free drinks at the bar for that, which was nice. We switched to a non-smoking room in the morning. The walls are thin and you can hear everyone walking by, opening/closing doors in the hallway and every ambulance that passes by throughout the night. (We were on the 17th floor). There is only one restaurant and a bar in the hotel. Normally this isn't a problem but the restaurant doesn't serve breakfast and it is only Asian fusion, so after awhile it would get boring. The appetizers at the bar are also on the menu at the restaurant so you are eating the same food. We had breakfast for room service once and it was ok. I suggest walking up the magnificant mile and eating breakfast at eggsperience on ontario. Decently priced, open 24 hours and extensive menu. No swimming pool. They do have free wifi but you have to call every 24 hours to get the new passcode. No problem really but if you are in the middle of doing work stuff online it will time out and you have to start over. If we visit Chicago again, we would definately stay at the hard rock. Places of interest - Carmines for dinner. Planetarium/shedd aquarium to get great city view pictures. Take a south Chicago tour, lots of unknown history and you can see where president Obama lives.

At times I felt the hotel was trying too hard to be cool, but better that than trying too hard to be good and failing. We were put in one of those rooms that I like to refer to as \"trip over the furniture\" style, but it was fine for two people. We could have paid extra for a larger room, but didn't, so it's not the fault of the hotel. Our room had a king bed and a surprising comfy chair and ottoman. The work desk was large, especially after removing all the stuff they had covered it with. The worst issue about this room is lack of storage. There's an armoire for hanging clothes, plus two shelves and only two small drawers. The rest of the storage is taken up with a minibar and snack drawer that auto-charges, so you can't make use of them for storage. This was painful for two adults staying for a week, as we had to resort to stashing our belongs along the wall behind the chair. The Base bar was a great place for meeting up with colleagues, but at $13 a drink, beyond what most managers would approve on expense accounts.

We managed to get pretty reasonable pricing on a pair of Platinium Double Queen rooms at 150 per night. For the area and the size of the room it just couldnt be beat. We were a block away from the bean and the nicer parts of Chicago. The beds were quite comfortable, the bathroom was huge, and the view wasnt spectacular but looking down on busy Michigan Ave wasnt too bad. We ordered room service one day, it was kind of expensive as most room service tends to be. With a jug of coffee, a one person breakfast crept up to 50.00. Check-in was pretty effortless, and prompt. One of our rooms was on the lower floors (4) with the China Grill private party area nearby. This would normally be a bad idea as you'd get alot of the ambient noise, but the Hard Rock did its homework and has an extra set of glass doors on that floor before entering the rooms area so the noise was non-existent even with a function going on. Michigan Ave is a fairly busy road, so if ambient noise from outside bothers you, I'd say pick a different hotel. We didnt mind it because we liked the energy of busy Chicago below, but if youre a light sleeper it might be an issue. On checkout, we had a slight issue with a can of redbull that we took out of the minifridge to make room for some milk we had left over from the convenience store. They had originally charged us for the redbull (8 dollars). But they quickly removed it when i brought it up that we didnt drink it. The people behind me had a similar complaint so I assume its pretty common. It might be one of those pressure sensitive minibars that senses when somethings been moved. Definately skip the minibar, its way expensive and theres limitless convenience stores and establishments all around there. The sale rate we got was kind of hidden online. If you goto their site the default rate is labeled as The best rate, but there are specials underneath that drop down that are actually better rates. So the term 'best rate' is kind of decieving.

Lots of windows in the room (and the bathroom), so be sure to close the curtains unless you want the world to see what God gave you. ;-) The room was filled with some pretty mod furniture, a nice flat tv with a decent surround sound system attached, a huge desk, a fake alligator skinned chair/ottoman, and a few more normal bedroom items. The bathroom was stocked with Aveda products, and a decent size. Location was excellent of this hotel! Right on Michigan Avenue, when you walk out the door, you have the river on your left, and Millenium Park on your right. Just perfect. And very close to the best coffee in Chicago, Intelligentsia.

We had gotten a discounted rate of $99 per night, and I was excited to have what appeared to be a great rate at a luxury hotel. Having said that, I had no illusions that we would get the best room. I mean, it's not uncommon for hotels to put the guests who paid more in the better rooms. But I WOULD expect the amenities in the rooms to be as stated. Overall, there was a lack of attention to detail. The bathroom was not fully stocked with enough towels, there was no hair dryer, the in room safe batteries were dead, and there was no guest directory for information on the hotel. These things we discovered over the duration of our stay, and it just kept feeling like one more thing after another. I will say that when I was able to very quickly resolve the issues, but really, in this type of hotel those things shouldn't happen. It totally takes away from the experience. The pros: Excellent location, staff friendly and welcoming, very clean and well kept. You can open the windows for fresh air. Cons: As I mentioned above, lack of attention to detail. If I had paid a rack rate for this room I would have been really upset. $9.99 per day charge for wireless internet. Really? At a \"luxury\" hotel in 2010?

The room was spacious and I was lucky enough to have a nice view of the river. The bed was really nice, I have some back problems and I was expecting to wake up feeling some pain but it never happened. The flat screen TV was also a nice plus. The bathroom was also large, the pressure of the shower was a bit capricious but I attributed to the early morning rush. The main minor drawback was the lack of light in the room. I had already read about it on tripadvisor but I thought that people were being peaky but honestly, they were right. If I were to be staying there for a weekend, it would have been fine but since I was there on business for a week, it meant that when I went back to the hotel, I would fall asleep. That is how dark it was. In the morning, I had to move the suitcase in the bathroom in order to find my clothes. My friend, to whom I described it to, said that maybe it was only for rockstars that do not not need light! ;-) OK, jokes aside, it was hard to spend time in the room at night, unless I was lying in bed watching TV. The second minor complaint on my part was the maid service was inconsistent. The first day I had taken out a bag with a pillow and the throw from the closet because it was cold and the next day, it was still on the floor and the throw was not folded, I found it a bit weird. The bathroom floor was not always very clean but the service improved over the week so maybe it was a one-time thing, I did not even bother to complain. My check-in and check-out was very easy and hassle-free, I have no more comments on the service, since I did not eat or use room service. Overall, I would say that the hotel is ideal for a weekend trip in the city, the location is amazing, close to shopping and restaurants.

Another note on security - the elevators are a little separated from the front desk. There is an entrance by the front desk and another by the elevators. There is no real security near the door by the elevators and they do not lock it late at night. My friends and I were waiting for an elevator and an old lady ended up getting in the elevator with us, following us to our floor, all the while telling us a sob story about how her car was towed and she needed money to get it and ended up walking away with $40. We had been out for the evening partying, so clearly were not a skeptical as we should have been and she did look normal, but the hotel's security should have not allowed this person to enter the hotel if they were not a guest.

Well appointed. SUPER Comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and wonderous pillows. The large TV has a cool sound system that ramps up the viewing experience. There's a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar. I've always had a room with big windows and a view down Michigan Ave (the hotel sits right on Michigan - a block from the canal). The bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures sporting a great design... some of the showers have windows in side of them (you can shower AND enjoy the view down Michigan!) or close the waterproof drapes. I've never had anything but a great experience with the staff here... front desk, doorman, etc are all great. There's a lobby bar that still feels intimate and has nice energy. Big screen TV to catch the latest scores, too. Of course, Rock & Roll music pumps thru the place. You can stay at a \"plain\" hotel anywhere... but this is a GREAT, WELL DESIGNED, FUN and MEMORABLE HOTEL that you'll want to return back to. If I had one concern - it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight. My daily car parking rate was close to $50 per night, which I'm sorry to say is about the going rate in the loop. Stay here.

However, it didn't take us long to figure out that something was wrong. There was a consistent noise that kept rattling every few seconds. I called the front desk and immediately the engineer came up to investigate the problem. He assured me he would speak to the staff member at the front desk and she would get back to me - sure enough the phone rang minutes later with the determination that our room was close to a mechanical room and sound would continue. I was not happy, but Claudia (at the front desk) did an awesome job of relocating us, ultimately to a beautiful Tower Suite and giving us several passes for the beautiful breakfast buffet at the China Grill restaurant. All the staff here were professional, friendly and helpful. Even though we were less than pleased at first, they made every effort to make our stay exceptional - Demetrius was terrific at helping us with our luggage and the housekeeping staff kept everything neat and clean - even bringing up a new blow dryer quickly as the one in our room was only blowing cold air.

It was a great location, not your usual stuffy city hotel and my husband loved the \"Check In Rock Out\" program where he had a Custom Les Paul guitar to play for the duration of our stay - I hope they expand this program to other Hard Rock Hotels as we will be going to the Hard Rock in Orlando in February and both my son and husband would love to participate in this program there as well.

We were told that they had no connecting rooms or rooms next to each other and that we would be on the same floor, which was fine by us. On entrance of the room, it looked clean and modern, but then at closer expectation, you notice the TV sets are out of date and the windows are not the easiest to open, without a fight or a slight chance of hurting yourself. Also, we noticed the lighting is very low in the rooms, and I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure if this was because they are trying to hide something or just give the whole hotel and dim lighted look, but in the rooms, the guest should have the choice on how low or high the lighting should be, especially if you have dropped an earring and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anything, without your trusty pocket sized Maglite!

I wanted to stay there on my last trip to Chicago a few years ago but didn't want to spend the money. This time I chanced into a 50%-off rate on the hotel website and booked a Select King. Since I spent less than $300 on three nights please keep in mind that I could have had a different view had I spent full price. The location is perfect and the Carbide and Carbon is impressive if you are into architecture. You are so close to Millenium Park that it's easy to take a quick walk over at sunsets and watch the skyline change on the Bean. We checked into the hotel around 10pm after a flight from the West Coast and my first reaction was that the place was way too trendy for us -- we were wearing polartech and hiking boots. (But that was the only time I felt this way because we used the revolving doors straight onto Mich Ave after that and didn't go through the lobby again.) We were told there were only two Select King rooms left, one on a high floor but next to the cleaners' closet and one on a lower, traditionally renovated floor without rock memorabilia. We opted for the lower floor -- the 13th, I think. The room was fantastic, on the northwest corner of the hotel with a view on one side down the river to the Merchandise Mart and on the other side down Mich Ave. Not a lot of space in the room but enough for two people. Yes, it bothered me that I couldn't put much in the frig because of the mini bar set up, but I also didn't ask the hotel for an alternative so there might have been one. The bed was very comfortable with a pillow-top mattress and the bathroom was huge. We did have a graphic of the Beatles in the bathroom and a mirrored pic of David Bowie in the bedroom so our room did have a bit of a rock feel to it. And the room was quiet from inside noise! Of course there were sirens and street noise, but I didn't hear anything from inside. I know the city well so we did our own thing and didn't eat in the restaurant, go to the bar or ask the concierge for help so I can't comment on those.

Right on Michigan Ave, a block and a half from the Chicago River and just over 2 blocks from the Art Institute. Dog \"friendly\" Now the bad part: We checked in and were told that we could not leave the dog unattended at any time - in other words, we could go nowhere as a family. The manager had me sign a waiver to get around that issue. We were then checked into a smoking room even though we requested a non-smoking room. 30 mins later, that problem was corrected. We were surprised to see that both rooms (not suites) could barely hold the 2 queen beds and still have room to walk wround them. (They never showed a room in the photos with 2 queen beds) . Both rooms had beat up furniture and looked like it had seen its day (however the beds were comfortable and clean). In addition, our air conditioning was non-functioning. When I mentioned later in the day our dissappointment in the room(s), the manager apologized and said that he had a suite that was empty and we could have it - that is if we wanted to pay the cost difference! (Let's see here...you have unhappy customers, an empty, unbooked room but instead of making the customer happy, you insult them by asking them to pay!) When it came time to walk the dog, we were told that the closest grassy spot for her was FOUR blocks away! Not very dog FRIENDLY - perhaps more dog tolerant. Two of the five elevators that we stepped in throughout the weekend never moved - just closed the doors and sat there. If you wanted a stack of 3 pancakes from room service, that will be $11. - the prices go up from there. All in all this hotel is in a classic historical building (the carbide and carbon building) and in a great location but this hotel is riding on it's name and is really quite poor with a front desk staff that has very few customer service skills (the baggage guy and consierege were very nice).

The location is excellent for tourists, being close to everything. Hotel is very stylish and there is a bar (expensive) just off the lobby area. We had a room with two big comfortable beds but there was not enough storage space. Wardrobe had adequate hangers for a hotel (about 8 I think) but there were only two drawers, not a problem probably if you are only away from home for for a night or two but we were on a two week trip with loads of stuff. I don't think we've stayed anywhere with so few drawers available. (There was actually a third but it was filled with snacks as an extension to the minibar so you couldn't remove them or you'd be charged for using them). Room was equipped with a hairdryer, iron and ironing board and a coffee maker. There was a TV and video with a games console but just one chair for two people. Coffee provided was OK but really strong as you only go one packet of creamer for two cups of coffee. It would have been lovely to be have been able to make a proper cup of tea! (We've been in other US hotels where they provide English Breakfast tea - perhaps this could be provided instead of, or as well as, the herbal tea provided at the moment). Check in was smooth but we were disappointed hotel did not have a supply of tourist information, we actually went into the Holiday Inn nearby when we were out for a walk and got loads of leaflets and help there. Concierge at Hard Rock gave us a map which was useful, and offered to book anything we wanted but how would we know what we wanted to do without looking at some information first? The bathroom had a huge walk-in shower (no bath) but it was one of those you have to get in before you put on - therefore be prepared to jump out of the way until it warms up. There was an illumniated make-up mirror which is a great idea but it didn't matter which way you turned it you couldn't get a decent light on your face to apply makeup. Minor complaints only however and having just read other reviews of the hotel I think the Hard Rock is probably more suited to bachelor parties, groups of young people and people there just for a night or two who know what they want to do rather than tourists wanting a base for a longer period - due to the lack of storage space for belongings, and lack of tourist information in the hotel. Having said that the room was fine, maid service excellent and we had a fabulous view. We got a special rate from hotels.com for this hotel (50% off) and at that rate hotel was OK but I don't think its worth the full rate price compared to other hotels we've stayed in.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, MJI", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Business & Lesiure Accomodations\u201d", "Author": "travelgirl0482", "ReviewID": "UR28143035", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Chicago for a Business Trip.

The bed was very comfy but the sheets didn't reach all the way up (it was like there was no fitted sheet) so it kept slipping down, which annoyed me. Also, you'd think the Hard Rock would have more TV channels. I've stayed at Super-8's with more channels. But the location is fantastic, as was the service. We watched 10 minutes of a movie before it shut off (they said there was some kind of problem with their server) so they made sure to refund us. I wouldn't recommend paying for any extras (room service, mini bar, etc) because you won't be able to shake the feeling of being ripped off. $8 water, $27 sandwich? No thanks.

My stay was booked through my company as we have a discounted rate and I was here on business. Based on reading other reviews here, I must have gotten the most basic type of room. It was pretty small, exceedingly dark (dim lighting) and a very minimal view. It was on the 14th floor, and I mostly looked out at other buildings, although I could see a sliver of Millenium park and \"the bean\" between two buildings. I had only one window. The decor is minimalist, modern, masculine. Everything gray and taupe. Comfortable bed and desk chair. It was kind of depressing to spend too much time in the room because of the darkness. When I first got to the room, I turned on every light and it was still quite dim. I called the front desk to see if all the rooms were this dark and they told me that was they style at this hotel. They did volunteer to bring up a lamp which helped somewhat. I was also kind of warm in the room and it seemed as though the thermostat was not responsive. I asked for a fan and that helped quite a bit. The staff I interacted with were all helpful and prompt. The location is central -- easy to go north to the magnificent mile shops or the river north restaurants. Also a short walk to milennium park to the south or the shops along state street. It fronts on Michigan Ave. so easy to get around and orient yourself. The computer in the lobby was easily available, the atmosphere was nice down there. Also there was wireless in the room and I had no problem connecting with that. The bathroom was interesting. Nice fixtures and a cool look. No bath, but a big shower. The fixed glass shower door only covered half the opening, if that makes sense -- so the other half is where you enter the shower and is always open. I could not avoid having some water splash out through the opening, so kind of a weird design. Nice Aveda bath products. All in all, it's a nice hotel and good location.

Unfortunately, I'd say the location is probably the best thing about it. Mind you...there was nothing wrong with the service, the staff, the booking process, or even checkout. It was just that the room was incredibly mediocre and average, and for the $299/night I paid, I definitely had other choices. I stayed five nights, so I think I had a good amount of time to experience the hotel. I requested a smoking room, which may have been one of the issues. The view from the room was great--I saw right onto Michigan Avenue and was fairly high up. However, the room was pretty dark, and you didn't have more than a few light sources to illuminate the room. As a result, the room was perpetually as lit up as a club--but without the cool ambience of a club. The bathroom was set up strangely. You had a window that looked onto the street that was in the shower/bath. I guess that's cool if you want to soak in the tub and look at the buildings and skyline, but if you're taking a shower, it's strange to have to pull the shade and then put the shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel on the window sill. Some people with voyeuristic streaks might like this, and maybe if I were there with a female friend, it would have been different. The minibar was not well-stocked at all, and I ended up just going next door to the pharmacy (Walgreen's or Rite Aid or whatever it was) to get what I normally would have gotten at the minibar.

The Location: Excellent, right downtown just of the magnificiant mile, close to millenium park and walking distance to the waterfront. The Room: was trendy, although the furniture in my room was showing some significant signs of wear and abuse. the carpet in my room was also in need of replacement as it was stained, and also starting to bunch up.

The Staff, was okay, each and every staff member said hi and made you feel welcome whenever the seen you. front desk was nice and efficient, the concierge desk was a little on the un-educated side: I asked them some directions a couple of times and they had limited knowledge of the area, even simple things like: how to get to the waterfront running/walking paths?.

Summary: this should be priced in the $150-$200 range, at $300 per night I expect more, such as a hotel airport shuttle, a small refrigerator in my room, maybe a ipod dock (the room had a cd/dvd player but who travels with cd's anymore?) the location is great.

Be advised that while this hotel is downtown, it is not on the Magnificent Mile - it is a several block walk. (You are closer to Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago.) However, you are close enough to have access to the Magnificent Mile and you will probably get a better deal at this hotel than others in that area. We had debated between this hotel and the Hotel Monaco (a Kimpton Hotel) which was down the block, and having walked into the Monaco to check it out, I am very glad we stayed at the Hard Rock. The Monaco's lobby looked kind of tired looking and Marriot-esque.

He recommended a nice place \"where you could order anything and it would be good.\" He told us they didnt take reservations because it was so popular. We trotted off, expecting some swanky back-alley hot spot, a true taste of Chicago. Moments later, we arrived at we soon realized was the Chicago equivalent of the Cheesecake Factory. We were stunned. We definitely did not fly all this way to dine at a chain restaurant with 80 year olds and eight year old girls. We were expecting a concierge at a nice hotel to send us somewhere quaint and classy with local color, not somewhere with bottomless refills. Then we asked the front desk lady if there was airport transportation (such as a shuttle) back to the airport. She told us she'd be happy to \"flag a cab\" for us. Umm, even the Holiday Inn has a shuttle. The Hard Rock is supposed to be a nice place. In addition to that she was so dazed and confused and unable to answer even the most basic questions, we almost wondered if she even really worked there. Finally, the lackluster service at the hotel bar Rocks was really a downer.

I agree with the previous reviewer who said the rooms are too dark to work. The rooms have no overhead lighting outside the bathroom and have just one lamp that is supposed to light the whole room, but does a poor job. There are three other lamps- one on the desk and two by the bed, but they are primarily made for reading, not illuminating the room. The exercise room was good, the staff was friendly. Overall it was a fine hotel. My one gripe is with the room I was first given. It was room 2501. I'm giving this just to warn others in case you get this room. There are very few rooms on the 25th floor, so I'm betting the problem is with all of them. Initially, I noticed that the room had two big spotlights outside the window that are used to illuminate the top of the building. I'm sure it looks cool from outside, but it will force you to close those blinds (therefore robbing you of your view) because they are quite bright. Not a huge deal- I just closed the blinds. The second problem I noticed was a banging noise that happened every minute or so. I'm a sound sleeper, so didn't think it would bother me. But every 5 minutes or so there was a much louder bang/rattling noise. It was loud enough to make me jump each time it happened. The first time I thought someone was breaking down the door to my room. I think it must have been noise from the mechanical room, which I noticed was also on the 25th floor. Not being one to cause a fuss, I decided to try and deal with it. Well, by 2am I was wide awake in my bed awaiting the next jarring BANG! I finally gave up and called the front desk around 3am and they were nice enough to give me another room. Not sure what I would have done had the hotel been sold out because I could not have gotten a good night sleep with that noise. I can't imagine I'm the only person who has had this experience with this room unless this was a temporary problem within their hotel. So my gripe here is that they put anyone in that room at all considering 99% of the population would have a very difficult time sleeping through the noise.

Not a bad view from the upper floors (23rd), facing the new Trump building - ok, would've been better if would've faced Michigan Ave for example, but I'm not complaining. The hotel is, as probably everybody has already said, filled with various rock memorabilia like rock stars' guitars, and is decorated with various monochrome pictures of rock stars on walls, the mirrors in the rooms and the bathroom wall. The colors repeated throughout the hotel are lots of gray and black, dark brown. It's also kinda dimly lit. Some people haven't liked it, I dug it. The room itself had a REALLY comfortable king size bed; an old school TV set with a dvd player, a mock black \"crocodile skin\" recliner/chair, a long desk, full bodysize mirrors (one on the wall, the other on the closet). Basic stuff really. I think the more expensive rooms have more modern TV's... This room was also really quiet. Some people justify spending less on a hotel room by saying, \"well, what do you need a fancy hotel room for, after all we just go there to sleep\". Well - a lousy hotel experience can ruin the entire trip, don't you agree? I can't tell you how nice it was to to come home from the cooold Chicago weather, into the warm room, take a warm shower in the nicely sized and modern bathroom, slip into the bathrobe and then climb in the SUPER comfortable bed. And I got a really decent rate on Priceline, the nightly rate wasn't even close to the one quoted here for example. Location is great, right downtown on N Michigan Ave. Within walking distance to a lot of places and restaurants, and the closest subway station is almost around the corner.

There was also 2 large windows facing east into an office building where about 10 minutes after getting into our room we spotted a guy with binoculars looking into our room at us. Fortunately all the windows had opaque shades; we kept those pulled down during office hours. There is a lack of lighting, it is still dark in those rooms at night with all 3 lamps on.

We were both less-than-enchanted with the hotel we'd stayed at for the first part of the visit, and decided to try out the Hard Rock, despite the fact that we both prefer locally-owned hotels and B&Bs. I loved the Hard Rock - it's in an Art Deco building in the heart of the Loop, walking distance to all kinds of shopping and restaurants and destinations. We were both a little scattered for our trip (I'm always pretty flaky, Fiancee had a cold), and the staff really went above and beyond for us. The front desk staff was great, friendly, and efficient during our check-in. Fiancee's cold knocked him out cold as soon as we got to the room. I think that the stunningly good linens, down comforter, and fake fur pillow (wonderful for a couple on vacation and missing their pet cat!) made him ever happier to sleep the entire visit. He was fine the next day, much to my relief. The bathroom wasn't the greatest (style over function), and the room was a little small, but overall, I really enjoyed it. The mini bar was fun, and we had a great view. The decor was great, really held together, but I found all the silver and gray to be a little cold. Since Fiancee was out like a light, I decided to do some work - I had to use the hotel computers to take care of some business (one of my work programs isn't compatible with my Mac laptop) and actually had to get the IT guy's help to load the program on the hotel computer. He could have easily said no, and I wouldn't have held it against him, but he went to a great deal of trouble to make sure I could get my work done. I got good dinner recommendations from the staff. I stopped by the boutique and got great service there. And when I forgot a ring in our room, everyone from the front desk to the bellman to the housekeeping staff made sure I got it back again. Even the valet was nice (and they had a radiant heater outdoors you can wait under while the valet gets your car - that was appreciated!) This isn't really the point, but almost all the staff I saw at this hotel were hot, male, and tattooed. I'm sure the female staff is stunning, too, and I just wasn't there on their shift.

Check in took a little while and we thought it was fairly humorous that the front desk personnel were singing along to the music playing. Room was fairly expensive, but the location makes it worth while. I was a bit concerned that we would have charges for a deposit for the minibar, but the bill was accurate and no issues.

The bathroom was a little dark too, but no one had any problems putting on makeup. The bed was awesome, as people have mentioned before.

Didn't need so much light at night since we were out and about! But upon our arrival back at the hotel, no issues with the lights at all.

After a few minutes of speaking with the manager, he rolled his eyes, AND GAVE ME THE SUITE! It was amazing - huge with wraparound floor to cieling windows, 50 inch plasma tv, basically the works.

I got to Midway and took the orange line to Lake/State stop and walked 2 blocks to N. Michigan and there was the hotel. So far, so good. The woman at the front desk was very nice and apologized that the room was not ready yet (it was 7:30 AM, I wasn't expecting it to be ready) but asked if we would like to stow our bags and call back in an hour. We stowed our bags, went to explore the magnificent mile and came back three hours later and the room was ready. I was now panicked. The reviews said, dark, smelly, dirty and rude. the rude part, so far, was untrue. Got to room. It was dark, smelled fine and was pretty clean. As a base of operations, one could not ask for more. Hard Rock is a block or two from Millenium Park, a block to the Chicago river, a nice hike to the Hancock Building, but would be a nice stroll in warm weather (walking straight up N. Michigan with all its great malls and stores in the summer would have been terrific, unfortunately, I just got back and its January). Sears Tower, also walking distance, Navy Pier, not so far. restauants on state street and ohio, very walkable. Get the point? The hotel elevators are so fast, one could get the impression that they were your own private elevator. The fitness club was fine, empty whenever I was there. The business center allowed me to surf the web 24/7. The bed we had was fantastic. It was firm with a pillowtop. Very comfortable. There was internet access in the room also, I just didn't bring my computer so I used the business center. The one major issue that I had and it's the only one, it was DARK! I guess rock n rollers are creatures of the night, but this is really a bit much. I saw where a lot of the other hotels were, such as the four seasons, ritz carleton etc and a lot of the really fancy ones are further up on N. Michigan (Magnificent Mile), but to access the rest of the City, south of the Chicago River, It would kind of be a hike.

Forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. Our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft, we were told). Decorated in grays and white, the room was comfortable and soothing, not jarring. On the other hand, we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading, finding keys, etc. No kidding. The bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. On the positive side, however, there were Aveda products in the bathroom, the windows were huge, so during the day there was tons of natural light, and no issues with darkness. The king size bed was very firm, but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. We had a largish TV with a DVD player. There is a safe and munchies. The gym is perfect, equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. It is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. There are towels, water, headphones, disposable ear pads, and complimentary green apples. Suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd, take the elevator up to 22nd, then down to L2 to get to the gym. This way you dont have to traverse the lobby. The front desk staff is amiable, and very attentive. I read some other reviews about nasty personnel, but did not have that experience at all. I got a free newspaper with a smile, a free stamp when I needed it, change and all the coffee I could tolerate in the morning. The Hard Rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the Water Tower, the Drury Theater, John Hancock, and magnificent mile. For those who like a thrifty breakfast, we recommend Gourmet Pantry at 155 N. Michigan Avenue [--]. This deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a Sunday morning, no less: $1.99.

It didn't help that the four days we were in Chicago were cold, dark, and raining. The other problem we had was when we ordered a roll-a-way. The fee was $25.00. It is a airbed that inflates. Once inflated, however, it did not fit anywhere in the room. We tried everything we could think of, but it would have to be folded over in order to fit. Didn't seem safe at all to me, I'm sure that it can't meet safety codes. Our son slept in our bed. When I asked the staff that I didn't want to be charged $25.00 because the bed could not fit in the room, they looked at me like I was crazy.

I was a little reluctant to book here, but figured I'd be prepared because of all the mixed reviews I had read on trip advisor. So, because we reserved so early (we knew rooms would be limited in the area because of the run) I called every two months to make sure we had our reservation. Each time I called, a pleasant person answered and confirmed registration and package. I even got them to assign a hotel room in advance (Rm 1806)and give me an earlier check-in time and I confirmed it over and over. We came into Chicago, took the \"L\" and checked in with the front desk--no problem, but no one knew what the \"uncensored package\" was. It's not like we really cared, we just wanted the breakfast! They said they would call up and let us know. Never called. I went downstairs and talked to them again--the people there said there was no such thing as the \"uncensored package\" and they would call up to let me know what they found out. Never called. At that point, I didn't really care to keep calling, because we had stuff to do with the marathon and quite frankly, that's not MY job. We had a small, clean room. Good view of N. Michigan street. Large bathroom with a tub/shower, Aveda bathroom supplies and plenty of fluffy bathrobes and towels. Beds were really great and it was generally quiet up there (those were the key things the runners needed!). The bar downstairs was a good place to end up after a night, even though the bartenders act too hip for you. The doormen were the best! What crackups! The internet access in the business center was free. It was always open and there was no one around--it just cost money to print off their computers. The room service people would forget toilet paper, of all things, and I would have to call and ask for it. Concierge service was a joke--they tried to set things up for us (boat arch. tour) and didn't do it right and offered no options (we called and booked on our own). Fridge in room wouldn't dispense things--called to get it fixed. It was fixed electronically and I ate a few things out of it and they didn't charge us on our bill. On the last day, we got the bill and, lo and behold, it listed the \"Uncensored Package\" with my room rate! I was so mad and called the front desk and wanted to know why they (essentially) lied and didn't follow up with me about this. No explanations--I finally said \"Well, at least I want breakfast ONE of these days!\" They said no problem--I called room service and had a GREAT meal delivered up. Room service tried to give me the bill, but I told them that the front desk was taking care of it. I should have just done that every morning, now that I think about it. So, all in all, the hotel really doesn't live up to the hype and it's way over-priced for pretty crappy service and small rooms. The little things are nice (products, bed, view-if you're lucky), but it just doesn't seem to cover the lazy, inexperienced and ridiculously pretentious service that comes with this hotel. I just don't know how this place has managed to get away with this for so long--I've never seen a hotel where the reviews are so mixed and vary wildly one way or another.

Admittedly, we'd rather be on the other side of the river but due to the limited hotel rooms available when we made our reservations, we decided to try the Hard Rock. Our 8:30 PM check in went smoothly, although it is a bit odd to have to navigate the patrons in the dark lobby turned lounge for the evening hours. Our room was on the 18th floor with a decent view down South Michigan Ave. Typical of a revamped metropolitan building, the rooms are a bit smaller than the typical hotel room but certainly not cramped or uncomfortable. The decor is a stark, cold, modern kind of look, which is aesthetically pleasing to tastes such as mine but really didn't end up being very practical. The bathroom fixtures are all made of chrome open rung type surfaces which ended up being a nuisance as everything from the soap in the soap dish to the towels under the sink continually fell through the bars. The desk & chair are likewise very contemporary and great looking but not very ergonomically designed or geared for real use. My husband owns his own business and must stay in touch/do some work while traveling and found the setup very uncomfortable after a 1/2 hour or so. The internet service was awful at first but, after a call to the service company, they did get it straightened out by our second day. The bed was quite comfortable and the linens on the bed & in the bathroom were some of the nicest we've had. Housekeeping was good although they failed to replenish hygiene items during our stay. The sound buffering in the hotel is abysmal. Although old buildings are unavoidably noisy due to their construction, it's even worse in this building due to the complete lack of buffering. You can actually see daylight for a 1/2 inch around the top & sides of the room's door and there is almost two inches of space below. This serves as a megaphone for the already echoing sounds of every person stomping down the hall and every door slamming (some guests such as us seemed to catch on to this & were exceptionally careful about generating noise but others were oblivious which created disturbances day and night). Having a late afternoon flight, we requested a late checkout which was cheerfully granted. The automatic checkout wasn't working on the day of our departure but a quick phone call to the desk was all that was required. Overall, this is a nice hotel but we probably wouldn't be back unless there were no other options. It's the opposite side of the river from most everything we like to do while in Chicago and the noise levels made for a less than restful weekend.

We upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with \"an Incredible view\". Well, our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us. That was all we could see. So there was no view. The room was muggy. We had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74. We woke up sweaty both days. When we opened the window to get a breeze, the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing. The room was small and dark, but it didn't bother us that much.

The view was worse. I think the person checking you in should have the authority to make the situation right. I wasn't looking for any freebies. I just wanted the room that I reserved. The maid service was pretty bad too. We had drank some beers and placed all of the emptys into the case that the beers came in. PLaced the case right next to the trash can. Basically cleaned the room up before leaving for the day. (also left a nice tip). When we returned later that day, the case with the empties was never removed. They didn't replenish the shampoos/soaps/conditioners. Then there's the mini-bar. We had leftovers from lunch so we moved things around in the mini-bar so we could put the container of leftovers in there. When I got the bill, there was a $68 charge for the mini-bar! I guess if you move things, it electronically charges you. (the small print on the mini-bar states that but you'd have to get on the floor to notice it). I had to tell them about it at check out and she stated that \"we tell our guests about it at check in\". That was never comminicated to us. They took it off the bill without a problem. Other guests had the same problem. They should disable this \"modern technology\". The place was too dark. I like ambiance, but I also like to see what I'm doing. On the positive side, the beds were comforatable and the pillows were great. The air didn't seem to cool very well though. I've stayed in Chicago's magnificent mile 4 times and never had a problem with any of the chain hotels. I will choose one of those next year and will never stay at the Hard rock hotel again.

First, note the hotel is really a Sol Melia hotel branded as Hard Rock. The branding works - but its a Sol Melia hotel with HRC service style featured. Reminds me of most European style (including warm rooms on hot summer days). The Lobby and Bar area are cool and it sports an Asian inspired restaurant that is very pricy but with a very interesting menu - many selections are available via room service. The location is excellent - right on Michigan Avenue and quick access to the Magnificent Mile. A Starbucks is at the end of the block if you are so inclined. For the price, they should have turn down service - although the morning paper was silently delivered by 5 am. The Fitness Center looks good, but has not been well maintained - and I suspect will continue to decline.

Some great perks: -Each room has a disc changer and dvd player, and the concierge has a ton of great CD's that you can borrow for free. -The location could not be better! We happened to go during a Taste of Chicago which was a three minute walk. And there is a restaurant called Giordano's a block away that has the best stuffed pizza i have ever tasted. -Even though the regular rooms are great, we decided to upgrade to a suite after the second day.

We had a 'Tower' Room on the 31st floor. The view was UNBELIEVABLE! Great architecture and the channel of water during the day; awesome light show at night (the buildings are lit and some even change color!) The room itself was awesome, as well: spacious, modern, and cool artwork! (We lucked out to have Paul Stanley (KISS) and David Bowe mirrored artwork in the room--2 of my husband's fave musicians!) My husband still compliments the king-size bed and how COMFY it was! We slept so well while there--THANK YOU HRH for a nice end to our vacation! The only odd thing in the room was the bathroom-- well the configuration of the door. When the door was opened it met the vanity counter and you'd then have to close it to get to the commode. Not a big problem, but there was also a fluffy cotton rug on the floor and you had to move it out of the way to close the door and it was just an inconvenience. The shower stall was HUGE(which was wonderful after traveling by Amtrak and dealing w/ the 'porta-shower' they have!), 2 adults have plenty of room and then some. The bath towels were huge--bath sheets--and they offered a nice assortment of soap, lotion, etc. They even have fresh orchids in the bathroom and bedside and they light a candle in the bathroom for you in the evening (at which time they also lay out a robe and slippers--meant only for room use, but can be purchased to take home...) I CANNOT believe the couple of bad reviews I read on TA!
