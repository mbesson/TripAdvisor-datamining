I have been staying in one or another of these hotels since 1981, and I will continue to do so every time I'm in Amsterdam. They are no-frills tourist hotels, with tasty breakfasts, comfortable beds, and can't beat location. The only down side is that most are located up a 2-story, steep staircase, which can be difficult for older or infirm travelers. These hotels are for travelers who don't want to spend money on fancy but who want to be comfortable. Several hotels advertise as gay-friendly.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Coast, Australia", "Title": "\u201cEverything We Needed.\u201d", "Author": "Jessska", "ReviewID": "UR118290334", "Content": "My partner and I booked this hotel online from Australia and loved the pictures and reviews. Being a young couple backpacking Europe we were on a budget and just needed something with decent bedding and a shower. This hotel was close to the central train station (10-15 min walk or 7eur taxi ride) and had trams passing directly outside. Close to the centre town square, Anne Franks house and the most AMAZING dutch pancake restaraunt that EVERYONE must try - Sarah's Pancakes. We had the room on the top floor with a balcony. The room was typical European size (small but not uncomfortable and we even had large bags) and had a shower, TV, coffee facilities, and a really comfortable bed. Toilet was right outside our door and we got a continental breakfast delivered daily. The staff were also incredibley friendly and even helped us with tours and let us leave our bags in the office for the day when we had to check out. The only things newcomers should be prepared for is the stairs and the gorgoues cat resident (just incase your severly allergic - she doesn't come near you though). The pictures tell no lies about the stairs but you do get used to it. All the stairs are like this in the city though so it's nothing unusual.

Receptionist offered to walk me to the hotel, but did not offer to help me with suitcase down the very very steep stairs. Once at the Hotel, I was asked to pay upfront, the same rate that I would have paid Westertoren, which I did, only to find the tiny cell I was assigned to had no ensuite shower or TV that was promised by Westertoren. To compound the problem, check-out was 11am, but I could only check in at 12noon. This meant I had to disrupt my day, just to return to the hotel, re-pack, and move to the other hotel. (Note: ask to see room before paying!) When I went back to Westertoren, I was offered an upgrade. Yet, I still felt short-changed. I paid a high rate for a crap room. Then I had to waste time to manage a problem that they created. The receptionist also asked me to return in an hour to move my luggage. I told him to move it up for me since I did not intend to keep returning to the hotel in a day. When I returned at 4pm, my luggage was still out in the open - with no one to guard it, neither had it been brought into my room. I found out that my new room was not ready yet. I was asked to wait at the next room for about 15 minutes. After more than 15 minutes, they were still not done yet, and they offered me the room I was in instead. This new room was noisy - as mentioned. It\u00c2\u00b4s next to a tram line and the bells are pretty, but noisy too. I had a balcony, a nice view, two beds (one double, one single), which did not help me much since I was travelling alone. (Note: I think there are rooms that do not face the main street, try and get those.) I did not get to sleep much on that one night. This was a complicated review - the place is cheap and location is convenient, but you have to weigh it against what seems to be prevalent problems that occur and whether you wish to spend half a day of your vacation trying to sort out the problems they throw at you.", "Date": "March 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant location, friendly and helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "LauUK", "ReviewID": "UR49171864", "Content": "The hotel was in a great location, really close to all the restaurants, nightlife and attractions in the centre of Amsterdam and also the picturesque Jordaan district.

Amsterdam is know for its canal houses and steep stairways, but this was crazy! Once inside you will find a very steep stairway leading to the check-in office. It literally was like climbing a ladder. If you are elderly or have any trouble climbing with suitcases please keep this in mind. Once checked in you will find another flight of stairs leading to a couple rooms. It didn't end there for us, up one more flight of stairs we finally arrived at our room (Number 8). I think there were just under 80 steps. The hotel reception was very friendly and offered us a chocolate, which we later ate after we caught our breath. I would definitely ask for a room in the back. The hotel has no A/C so you need to sleep with your window open. While the rooms in the front have a balcony, it is a very busy street and quite loud. Number 8 is in the back. The room has a mini-fridge tucked away in the closet. There is a small (10\"x6\"x3\") safe in the wall which is available to rent for a daily fee. The room is very small, but adequate if you just need somewhere to shower and sleep. The bathroom is separated from the room by an accordian folding door. There is nowhere to put your clothes while showering and the entire floor gets wet when you shower. The sink is located in the corner of the shower, so if you plan on shaving bring a mirror to hang above the sink. There was plenty of hot water. There is no phone in the room to contact the front desk. This means taking a trip down 2 flights of stairs to get another towel or whatever you need. This also means no wake-up call, so unless you are an early riser, bring an alarm clock. Breakfast is delivered to the room each morning with a knock on the door around 08:30, which acts as a good wake-up call. Breakfast consists of a juice box, 2 slices of bread, a hard-boiled egg, butter, jelly and a small yogurt or pudding. There is a \"coffee maker\" to heat up the water to add to some instant capacinno or tea, your choice. The hotel is in a great location though. Just a 2 minute walk to Dam Square, and about a 10 minute walk to the Anne Frank house. There is a tram stop just down the road to the left when you come out of the hotel. Be sure to get a 72 hour ticket at Central Station. It is good for all public transportation in the city and we only paid 19 Euro for one. I would stay here again if I couldn't find anything else in this location. Yes, it was small, but still adequate if you are looking for a \"no frills\" type hotel.", "Date": "June 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cdecent hotel - but overpriced for what you get\u201d", "Author": "forzuto13", "ReviewID": "UR7591312", "Content": "I stayed with a friend at the hotel for Queen's Day 2007. The prices were even more expensive for this reason that weekend. Paid 95 euro for the double, which they gave us room 9, probably the best room of hotel, since it has a little balcony, is on the top floor, has private bath and was bigger than the other rooms. The bathrooms in this place are small and ther is no place to put your things really. Luckily I had a small suitcase. They served breakfast in the room each morning around nine, so if you wanted to sleep in and also have breakfast then it wasn't possible. The beds were comfortable and with the doors closed you didn't hear so much the outside noise of the streets. The next night they moved us next door to room 8 so they could fit three people into room nine (poor guys). This room was even smaller and more cramped. There are small televisions in each room. There are also little refridgerators. All these little ammenities do not help to justify the overinflated prices, which even outside of a busy weekend were over 80 euro a night for room with private bath. Room 8 is quieter but you have no balcomy. Anyway, for the most part the rooms are clean and adequate. The hotel is in a good central location, close to the Anne Frank house (two blocks away) and the Westerkerk (one block). There is a great bagel place across the street to the right which come highly reccomended for they have fresh juice, bagel and coffee for only 4.95 euro. Mina, from Egypt, was funny and and a nice guy. He works the front desk for now. His English made me laugh and he was fun to talk to.
