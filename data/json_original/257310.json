The staff were polite, and helpful. The location is just great, it is walking distance to Darlinghurst/Kings Cross where we found some great places to eat, (in particular a great Thai place up the hill to Kings Cross called Two Seats, forget Elvis Pizza across the road from the Vibe, it was disgusting!) to get into the city it costs around $10-20 in a taxi. So you don't have to drive in and pay ridiculous carparking fees! The cleanliness of the rooms really let the place down, as soon as we walked into the bathroom there were hairs here and there, not what you want to see! And sitting on the toilet I couldn't take my eyes off the grouting in the tiles that had stains all over them, it looked like someone had vomitted into the basin and it wasn't cleaned up properly..... seedy! The room just had that, not well cleaned feeling which makes you feel abit icky?! The ledge behind/beside the bed looked like it had never been wiped too.... Im sure you are getting the picture.... As for room service.... forget it! We ordered an asian tasting plate, (one of the cheaper things on the menu) sounds great hey?! We received the smallest bamboo steamer you can buy filled with what looked like the $6 frozen yum cha selection you buy at Woolies! We paid $17 for it.... we also ordered wedges with sour cream, that was alittle too sour...: ( Overall we had a great weekend in Sydney, despite Vibe's failings, they have a good bunch of hotels that we have stayed in all over the country, they might just need to work on a couple of things or people will stop returning....", "Date": "April 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant value for money - stayed here twice - will return\u201d", "Author": "ladycatrin", "ReviewID": "UR126959600", "Content": "I have stayed here twice in king rooms with park views. I am fussy and cannot fault this hotel. Having stayed in expensive hotels on many occasions, this hotel is half the price and almost as good as the expensive ones. I have found the rooms to be of a high quality and the beds/pillows are wonderful. (The rooms without a view are larger to compensate for the lack of views). All rooms are equipped with a small safe, and all the standard conveniences you expect. At only $140 per night it represents fantastic value. Pros: Easy walk to Kings Cross & surrounds for restaurants / bars. Easy to catch train to Circular Quay, The Rocks (Opera House & Sydney Harbour Bridge) or a taxi for only $13, in-house restaurant/bar, room service (good food & coffee), nice reception & restaurant staff. Taxis constantly at front reception, central to everything. Quick proximity to Sydney airport. Negative : The heating button in my room on one of my stays didn't work but the temperature was ok anyway, the in-room safe key pad wasn't working. On my second stay the suite on level 6 was booked by a wedding party who were screaming, clapping, cheering, singing etc from their room until 2 in the morning. I complained and I give full credit to the night staff who immediately came to see me, agreed that the noise was excessive and offered me another room. They then sorted out the crowd inside, so I cannot fault their management of the situation. Great staff. Overall, for the price and the location - brilliant.

This hotel is the complete opposite - run down, bad value, frustrating staff. We paid $300 for a night in a hotel that is a 1km uphill walk to the nearest train station (in King's Cross). It was very difficult to get consistent information from staff - we booked this hotel because it had a rooftop pool, which would have been an excellent vantage point for the New Year's Eve fireworks. We asked four different staff members whether or not this would be open, and got different answers each times. The fourth, slightly more senior, staff member assured us it would be, but when we went to go up at about 10.30pm, there was no access to the roof, forcing us to make quick changes to our plans. There are 'Vibe Guides To' brochures each of their locations in a display in the lobby. They have a price on the front ($2.99), but then they say 'free to guests' underneath (who would pay for a brochure???). These guides contain a 2-for-1 for main meals for the on-site Curve Restaurant and Bar. Great value - but why hide it away in these guides? Breakfast is available in the restaurant for $26. Or you can buy a voucher the day before from reception for $15. The information about this offer is on a brochure in the room. Which means another trip down to reception to get the voucher before the next morning. The rooms are starting to look a little shabby. This hotel opened in 1999 as the Rushcutters Harbourside Sydney, before becoming a Vibe Hotel. My suspicion is that this hotel was put up in a rush to capitalise on the sailing events held in Rushcutters Bay during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and that poor workmanship is starting to show through. The rooftop pool is amazing, if a little crowded. There is a clear 'No Glass' rule, but on New Year's Eve we had a very frustrating experience. My husband and I were in the pool, and some girls were by the poolside drinking wine out of their glasses. Inevitably, one of the glasses smashed, and when one of the staff eventually came up around 6pm, she just stood there chatting with the girl for about half an hour, ignoring the smashed glass, and everyone else with glasses. It wouldn't have been a great start to New Year's Eve to have glass embedded in my foot after getting out of the pool. It is incredibly frustrating that the hotel couldn't foresee this - it is a hotel with a rooftop pool overlooking Sydney Harbour on New Year's Eve! Sticking some plastic cups the door would have been a welcome initiative - but even more frustrating that they didn't deal with it. Bits of glass in the astroturf next to the pool is just dangerous.

The hotel itself was ok. Very little privacy, you could hear every other door slam in the entire hotel. The location wasn't the most convenient if you like to travel by public transportation (steep hike up the 'hill' to the metro station). Wouldn't stay there again! We booked the room while on board a cruise ship and ran into internet difficulties, consequently we booked two rooms for one night instead of one room for one night. When we got to the hotel and registered there was no mention that we had two rooms. The rooms weren't ready and so we left the bags in the luggage hold and went to explore Sydney. When we returned the girl at the front desk asked if we were supposed to have two rooms. We told her that we weren't and she said no problem, we can refund the second room. We made it back home and when I checked my credit card statement, I had two charges. When I contacted Expedia, they said that they could not refund the charges without the manager's (of the hotel) approval and that I would need to contact the hotel myself. I called the hotel directly and I was hung up on once and after calling back spending about 15 minutes talking to someone at the front desk was told that the person who Expedia was communicating with is unavailable and that she could send me an email since they were unwilling to make an international long distance call. This irritated me since I was making an international long distance call so that I could call Expedia back and say 'yes, I talked to the desk manager and you can refund my money'. I left my email address and phone number and was never contacted. The time difference between my home location and there is only 2 hours, so it wasn't a matter of time. I sent an email through the website's \"Contact Us\" section relaying all of the information and the names of the people I had spoken to all along the way. I have not received any sort of response. I listed two different email addresses and two phone numbers. I have spent $356 for a room that should have be $175.

As the cost of rooms is not good value for money if you book for \"tonight\". Ask to see the room. Top floor was relatively quiet but adjacent rooms are not soundproofed enough so you\"ll be able to hear the TV. It seems that that have contract with a Australian Airline as many Staff were checking in/out on most of the higher floors during my stay. The place was refurbished for the Olympic Games in 2000 and requires an update. Breakfast $5 good deal, large coffee & pastry and breakfast staff were friendly and helpful. Staff : customer service was okay but most of the staff need a refresher on customer service or need training. Poor cross departmental communication. Fridge maintenance order was not properly actioned - had to call at least twice. They offered a change of room or some ice which was great but maintenance never got round to get it working. So I got staff to store my stuff in their fridge. Cool. No followup call regarding \" all fixed everything ok??? \" Heated Pool is good with nice views. Gym needs rejuvenation - equipment is old, some have rust on them. Sauna - did not try. Stayed on top floor - best floor -- book early as you do not want to pay full price One morning the cleaner was vacuuming a room around 7.30am and a half naked guest (perhaps an Airline Pilot or Steward) opposite the room popped their head out like Me in shock. Save on breakfast : Catch breakfast at Rushcutters bay park at 7.30am - 8 am, even to the Sailing Clubs or walk to kings cross for less than $10 breakfast specials. Morning Papers: to right of facing reception get a copy before the taxi drivers get them Wifi - You have to pay. Just go to the Kings Cross Library or Kings Cross Internet Cafes.

The advertise themselves as a 4 star property, however this is a serious miss representation of what is on offer here. Room service is limited, furnishings in the rooms are shabby and worn and the bar and restaurant are sub standard and close early. There are also no individually controlled bed reading lights in the room (being picky here - but funnily enough such a thing is a requirement of a 4 star rating, the fact the do not have them illustrates the falseness of their claims). The bathrooms are cramped and dark with low quality unbranded amenities. The location of the hotel is poor - not easily walk-able to any of the city sights or public transport, you will spend a fortune on Taxis. On a more salubrious note - the property sits right next to Rushcutters bay park - a night time 'cruising' spot for gay men - (the rustling in the bushes outside your room is most likely NOT a possum). I believe a minor Aussie celebrity was caught here 'george michael' style a year or so ago. The hotels only saving grace is the rooftop pool area which has a lovely view over the bay. It seems to me that the whole \"Vibe\" concept is to squeeze more money out of guests at the Toga groups inner city properties than they could by using the Travelodge brand.

The pillows were too soft and seemed well used to say the least and the room was very stuffy and there was no way to get fresh air in. The room was also not dark enough and I also hate that. A poor night's sleep resulted. I still can't work out why hotels don't make the comfort of the bed the highest priority. The most devastating problem however was the service from the night manager. He was rude, discourteous, incompetent and unhelpful. Here's why: I got in late from my gig (but not unreasonably late), 12:30am - and opened a bottle of wine only to discover there were no wine glasses in the room. Furthermore - no drinking glasses of any kind. I went down to reception to ask and the night manager (who took ages to get to the desk). He said he would send some glasses up to the room when he could have just walked into the dining room or bar next door and grabbed a couple for me there and then. I went back to the room and waited about 15 minutes and when they didn't arrive I called reception and got a terse, impatient response as if I should be prepared to wait and that someone was on their way. So I waited another 15 minutes - still no glasses. I called again and (get this) the night manager HANGS THE PHONE UP on me. TWICE! So I headed down to reception to see what the problem was. I had to knock loudly on the counter to get the guy to come out of the office and he was rude and confrontational virtually blaming me for the problem.

The area around the hotel has many restaurants, pubs and cafes to choose from - you definately won't go hungry. Also, near the hotel is Rushcutters Bay Park, where you can go for walks, run or just admire the many yachts and boats docked there.

The minibar, internet connection and room service were all priced outrageously, and were not used. Something else I noticed was the main door seemed to be fairly thin, and so all the noise in the corridor could be heard in the room. What really redeemed the hotel somewhat was the location. I was concerned about staying out of the city, and in an area like Kings Cross that has such a lousy reputation. On the contrary, it was a huge plus. It was very easy to catch the train from the airport - the hotel is just a short walk from Kings Cross station, which is considered part of the city for ticket pricing purposes. Victoria St and all its restaurants is only a brisk 10-minute walk from the hotel. The city itself was only about half an hour away by foot. Finally, the Rushcutters Bay area is very nice, with the park, the harbour, and the interesting little houses and shops on the winding leafy streets. I did hire a car, and Waratah St, just around the corner, is a quiet, one-way street which had a good amount of free parking available - a 4 hour limit during the day and you could park there all night.

Reception didn't tell me where the restaurant or any of the other features the hotel had so I can't comment on them, not knowing where they were. The room was very nice and fairly roomy. Nice location next to the park and handy to the airport. A shuttle bus can be arranged at reception for $15.

Managed to get a \"Special\" room, breakfast and car parking and for the price paid, considered this value for money. If I had to pay for breakfast and parking, then in my opion there are better options. If arriving by car from Sydney city and travelling through the William Street tunnel, you have an immediate and dangerous situation in having to drive across three lanes of traffic on your left to get to the hotel entrance and car park, miss this entrance and you have quite a trip before being able to do a U turn and return. I found it better to stay on my right out of the tunnel, turn right, right again and right again and cross the busy road with the aid of traffic lights into the hotel entrance. Check in was quick and painless, but on presenting my credit card was advised there was a credit card surcharge. Having been involved in the hotel industry for many years I am well aware hotel managements around the world include credit cards fees in their costs and overheads and this surchage is just a blatent grab for extra turnover. My room was X01, clean, with expected amenities, good size bed and more than satisfactory, however room (s) ending in 01 abut the lift well and once the TV is turned off and trying to sleep you can hear the steady whine of a lift moving up and down the lift shaft. It is not overly loud, but loud enought to encroach on sleeping. Corridor noise is loud however and other guests seem to enjoy making noise as they head to their room, slamming doors as they go. Buffet breakfast was good both mornings, ample hot and cold choices, pleasant suroundings, morning paper available at front counter (no cost). Parking under the hotel, press the buzzer and you are let in. Check out, oh so slow, just one staff person at the counter at 8am dealing with a picky customer checking every detail on their account, took about 15 minutes, surley at this time of day, must be peak check out time, more staff could be allocated. Staff very friendly and eager to assist. Conclusion: Nice hotel, not very convieniant to Sydney city and not close to anything. Kings Cross is a steep up hill walk taking about 15 minutes. Taking the car has the problems of finding car parking space or paying high parking fees, or a taxi, with the high costs associated with them. A good value package deal may make this hotel worth while, but if having to pay for extras ( breakfast and parking) there are perhaps better options. And avoid a room ending in 01, there may be other rooms around the lift well, so ask for a room away from the lifts for a good nights sleep.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGood basic hotel with the world's most expensive chocolate bar!\u201d", "Author": "Brocko25", "ReviewID": "UR108048407", "Content": "If you get a cheap rate as I did, why not.

Location is good and in hindsight it was a good move. On the plus side, the rooms are fine. It is best to get a park-view room, if not, your room will face some residential apartments which are so close you have no privacy. I did book a park-view room but was not given one, which was rather frustrating, so I rang down to reception and they moved me. The choice of TV channels is good, with a few sports channels like Fox thrown in. There are complimentary newspapers. When you ask for a taxi, the reception click a light on outside the hotel, and because it is on a main thoroughfare, I never waited more than 2 minutes for a taxi. Here is how I think Vibe can improve; 1. Breakfast - $28 for a full buffet breakfast. Sorry but a canteen style breakfast with limited choice and staff who barely speak English (and do not understand \"Brown sauce\"!!), lack of cutlery and having to stand around like a plum while your cereal goes soggy waiting for a spoon, is NOT acceptable. Go to the Bay 88 cafe about 50 yards up the hill - typical Sydney cafe, outdoor living etc etc, good menu. I had toast, coffee and a bacon and sausage roll for $15.50. 2. Laundry - I fully expect to pay a bit extra if I am just going to bag up the laundry and leave it on the bed for the hotel to organise. However, I weighed up what I needed to be done, and I would have paid $100. When walking up to Fitness First (in Kings Cross), I kept my eyes peeled for a launderette. There is one about 150 yards up the hill on the right hand side. Very friendly service - all for $19. Yes, nineteen. I understand profit makes the world go round, but not extortion. 3. Mini bar prices are scandalous. I had one chocolate bar and then went to the 7-11 which is about 30 yards up the hill. So for all the things that the hotel are trying to rip off their customers for, their is a perfectly adequate (for breakfast, much better), alternative within a stone's throw away. I do not the Vibe has such a frivolous clientele who are just willing to pay those prices without giving it a second thought. If there were in the middle of the outback then they have a captive market. Where they are located, they don't. Guests should wise up and not use these services, the hotel would soon reduce their prices. My other comments are that the key card system simply doesn't work, neither in the lift nor in the room door slot. Also the fact that I believe there are not enough front desk staff means that you can queue for 5 minutes just to get your card reset. This is frustrating to say the least. I wanted to go to the rooftop pool but there was some fashion shoot going on, so it was all closed off. A bit disappointing as it was my only slot that I could go up there and have a relax. The view looks great and the area seems nice. Shame the hotel choose to cash in at the expense of their guests. The gym is OK, also on the rooftop. There are about 4 machines from memory. I went to the fitness first which is in Kings Cross and about 10 minutes walk away. $22 for a casual visit, but excellent facilities including steam room. No pool. I hope the hotel finds these comments constructive. I do like the hotel, but I sincerely hope they take the pricing comments on board, because no-one likes to be ripped off.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cLong way out !\u201d", "Author": "SimonWise", "ReviewID": "UR101700542", "Content": "One of several Vibe hotels and the best I think.

OK we thought - we can move them together - no so - they were fixed in place to the wall. But the best was yet to come - when we went to the room and started to unpack we found personal items that were not ours and clothes in the wardrobe! We collected our belongings and went straight to reception - all we got was a look of surprise from the person there who advised that according to the computer the room was empty. We were moved to another room - still single beds. In addition to this, we also found out - by reading signs at the lift, that the hotel restaurant and bar were closed that evening due to a wedding. We were not told this by reception earlier in the week when we rang to confirm our booking or at check in. So much for our planned quiet drink at the bar and then dinner. On top of all this - the lifts are hopeless - many times we stood on our floor wating while the lift passed by without stopping - we resorted to the stairwell a few times. We also had trouble with our room swipe card - we had to have it reset twice and our friends also had to have theirs reset a number of times. The buffet breakfast was limited - not a great variety to chose from.

It took what seemed like forever to get this hotel, the traffic was pretty bad. My partner and I drove into the hotel driveway and parked the car to the side and I went to check in. Upon arrival I was attended by a staff member named Sarah. Sarah was initially pleasant, but during the whole time did not seem to be listening to a word that I said. This was quite obvious when she only gave me one door key! She did not even tell me when check out was or where breakfast was. Those little things that I always get told when I usually get checked into hotels. We even had the greatest luck in having her check us out too and at no instance did she ask us how our stay was or seemed like she cared. We did however did get told to \"Have a nice day\". When I went back to our car that was still parked in the driveway, I asked my partner why we were not given parking assistance yet. My partner advised that he was asked to park behind this other car and wait. So we waited and waited.. until I decided to ask the concierge what was going on. He asked if I had checked in and I told him yes. He said that we could now proceed to the car park. A bit late for that information. He also forgot to advise that we need a parking ticket/slip to put on our car, because if we did not do so, the hotel could tow away our car. We were also told that there would be plenty of parking when we come back to park the car later than night. Later that night the car park was FULL! Luckily there was one car that pulled out. The car park has two sections for parking. The other section was for some other special parkers. This then meant there really was not much parking available. This was evident that night when you saw people doing \"make shift\" parking everywhere! (DIY Parking is $22) We got assigned to a quiet room as we requested (probably the one thing they got right) on the third floor. The hotel looked aesthetically pleasing. Our room was of decent size. The view was odd, our view looked straight in some person's apartment. The bed was comfortable. The room had a decent sized flat screen television with a good selectionof channels. The room also appeared clean. The biggest failure of this hotel room was the bathroom! The bathroom was horrible. It was small and badly designed. The shower had not boundary around it, it's boundary consisted of just a shower curtain. The shower had a plastic chair in it! The shower had mould on the floor corners and on the shower curtain. The bathroom sink was so close to shower curtain that it was rather squashy. The shower was dysfunctional and when you showered the water would spray everywhere and by the end of your shower, the whole bathroom floor was wet and it resembled a lake. The shower curtain did nothing. The air conditioning in the room was pretty poor. It at times did not feel like it was working. It felt quite warm at times and the controls panel on the wall seemed like it was pressed so many times that it was hard to make it work. It was actually cooler in the hotel corridor than our room, even though I had put the air conditioning down to 15 degrees. The surrounding areas of the hotel are nice. There is a beautiful Rushcutters Bay Park next door that has water views of boats. The hotel is also a very short walk to Potts Point, which is great for food and shopping. The buffet breakfast was probably the best thing out of the whole experience. The staff there, particularly this nice Asian man were attentive and pleasant. The breakfast was nice. The usual culprits, toast (of many varieties), bacon, eggs, etc. The coffee was freshly brewed too. In the end I am glad that i only paid $120 to stay here. Thanks goodness I had a good deal, otherwise paying anymore to stay here would not have been worth it.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cNot a good Vibe\u201d", "Author": "RFBoston", "ReviewID": "UR95537192", "Content": "I agree with another post - take the hotel if you get a deal.

The bathroom was clean and modern and featured a shower and bath in one with good strong hot water, and the usual little hotel toiletries. A plus was the Room Service - food was basically the same price as eating at the Curve resturaunt so being the lazy cats we are, we ate in most nights and were called 'Miss' and \"Mr' respectfully by all staff, which is a treat when you are twenty. All staff members were prompt, cheerful but also pleasantly casual which suited the hotel well.

Firstly this didn't bother me personally as I had no intention of using the bar or restaurant for dinner but I am 1 of maybe 200 plus rooms who may have. Is it more incentive for this hotel to hire out the restaurant to outsiders (they were not house guests, I chatted to some of them) than to cater for in house guests? I did order room service twice during my stay and both fairly late at night, however alhough the food was good there were some let downs. First night ordered Butter Chicken served with rice, Indian bread and pappadums $21.50 plus $3 tray delivery. Twenty minutes after placing my order I get a call saying they had run out of rice, would I like extra bread? Tray is delivered, signed for then I realise no cutlery. Call room service and cutlery is delivered. No pappadums! Next night order spicy wedges with sour cream and sweet chilli sauce. Tray arrives, sign for it, realise it's a plate of wedges but no sour cream/chilli sauce, or cutlery. Call again, pot of sour cream/chilli sauce/cutlery delivered. Not much apology offered. $10.50 plus $3 tray delivery. Went for breakfast in the morning, sign says please wait to be seated. I waited, chirpy waitress takes my room number to bill and says sit anywhere. Well I tried but all tables were full. Walked around again and walked out. Knowing I had been billed I tried 30 minutes later and secured a table left by previous diners. Their used plates were still on the table, eventually cleared but no replacement of a fresh setting. I try to make the table look occupied using what I had, go to get self service juice, coffee and fresh cutlery to return and find my table occupied by other people who had obviously been told to \"sit anywhere\". I told them I had that table and they moved on looking for somewhere else to sit. In summary, breakfast is completely chaotic and disorganised. Not a recommended place for a relaxed sunday breakfast, and on top of that the food is pretty average. Bulk cooked tasteless scrambled eggs, soggy bacon, trust me I waited for the fresh tray and that was bad, roasted tomatos that could have done with another 30 mins in the oven, tinned baked beans, VERY stale croissants and absolutely no coordination in seating/clearing tables. Fresh fruit was available but the melon cut very thin and the pineapple so unripe they should have considered tinned instead. Room Service...well someone really needs to look at this, especially when there is an extra charge for it. How can a tray go out of the kitchen without someone noticing items missing, especially cutlery, twice!! Besides that it's a good hotel, fits the medium between top and lower.

I would just suggest that when checking in you make sure you don't get put on a floor with a tour group. The staff were very helpful and freindly. This hotel is a very short walk (uphill but not a long one) to a place where you can take the double decker tour bus (hop on and hop off... and also connects for no extra cost to a bus to Bondi Beach).. I would suggest getting the 24 hour pass on that bus for about $25 and get an idea of how the city is laid out. It also makes for easy transport to Sydney harbour and back. One night after dinner downtown Sydney we took a cab back to the Vibe and the cab fare was a pleasant $10.. (with tip). There is an airport transport bus that can be booked to pick you up right at the hotel for $14 a person .. There is a great Thai food restaurant next door as well as other restaurants and a beer and wine store on the same block (attached to a pub/restaurant). Overall, it was a fine place to stay (if you don't get a noisy floor).

At one point, the lobby and elevator area was starting to look like a grocery store parking lot with all of the luggage carts shamefully hanging around.

I wanted peace and quiet and easy access to the sailing marinas, yet to be in walking distance to Darlinghurst. Although I had booked a superior Parkview room, I opted, on inspection, to downgrade to a standard room. The standard room (though without view of the Park or the marina) was slightly larger than the Parkview room! And quieter because there were late night parties (with blaring music) going on directly below the Parkview rooms. Anyway I got my peace and quiet and easy walking to the Marina. I was a bit taken aback at the rooms and the general feel of the Hotel. The rooms and bathrooms were small / medium sized. Likewise, the bathroom. It was a no-fuss, no-frills room. The general feel of the hotel, reception, lounge etc did not seem to me to be a 4 star hotel. It reminded me of the 3 star european chain hotels - a bit \"plasticky\". The check in and staff were helpful in shuffling me about and handling my whims and fancies. They were also very helpful and knowledgeable about restaurants and places to go shopping. I needed a traveller's multiplug and sicssors, and newspapers. No problems - immediate with a smile. The hotel is next door to a provision store and a pub. So drinks and snacks were cheap - no need to spend huge sums of money on these at the hotel. A 10 minute walk to / from Kings Cross / Darlinghurst. Great for entertainment/nice meals/drinks A short 10 minute taxi ride to St George, Town Hall, etc for great shopping. Overall, not a bad but not a wonderful place to stay.", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cComfortable but has no vibe\u201d", "Author": "Mazworldtraveller", "ReviewID": "UR4729701", "Content": "We stayed at the Vibe after a very long flight from Singapore.

Wake up calls never came, mesages were not delivered, the sheets were not changed on daily basis, the in room interent did not work. We changed rooms 4 times in 7 days. The in room safe did not work in any of the rooms. One day, they forgot to make up the room--and when we returned in late afternoon, the maid staff had left.

We shopped around and compared this against the W and the Sebel Pier One and the price for this is substantially lower. Granted, it's not as nice as the W or Pier One, but it does has a similar modern feel. It has a nice bar attached to it and the restaurant has a good breakfast buffet. A few things to be aware of: 1) The location is a little out of the central area. You will need to take a bus to get to the Harbour area, Circular Quay, etc. It's not a long ride - maybe 10 minutes or so - and it's fun to ride the bus with people going to work. We stayed here almost a week and we took the bus everywhere. The Kings Cross area is within walking distance of the hotel. 2) The rooms are small. They are hip and modern, but they are small. 3) Realize that it's a \"good value\" sort of place - it's not a luxury hotel. It's a mid-range boutique hotel. I think the photos on the web site make it seem more upscale than it is.

There's also a rather large in-room electronic safe - a big plus if, like me, you travel with a laptop. Everything's well kept and very clean. On both my stays I found the staff pleasant and helpful. As for location, the hotel's right next to the harbour and a beautiful park. The latter has a wonderful outdoor cafe for brunch at the weekend. Transport's pretty good. Buses to the CBD are just across the road (takes about 8 minutes), with the subway 5 minutes walk up the hill. Kings Cross, with its 'delightful' nightlife and strange characters, is 10 minutes walk the other way. Having said that, the hotel isn't in the Cross and the surrounding area is safe. I'd highly recommend the Vibe Ruscutters. It makes a great base to explore Sydney without the extortionate cost of staying in the CBD itself.
