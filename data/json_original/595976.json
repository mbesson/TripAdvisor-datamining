There was a really weird smell in our room and it did bother me, but I was just too tired after a 11 hour flight to complain to the reception. The smell did kind of dissapear after the second night.

Generally good value for money with great location across the road from Times Square shopping centre. Even if shopping is not your thing there are food markets a few streets away and a couple of streets away are late night restaurants (on the opposite side of Times Square, two streets away) which is a five minute walk, and the quality of food is excellent with seafood restaurants, run of the mill chinese restaurants and a nice Vietnamese restaurant all reasonably priced. The area itself being Causeway Bay is not really local like say Mongkok is but it offers enough local flavour to make it interesting with very small vendors as well as the more familiar names and even high end fashions (in Times Square). There are other shopping nearby such as Toys R'Us, Sogo, Swatch etc Times Square offers everything from Marks & Spencer right up to the more expensive chains. Staff at the hotel will give you a map and show you where other shopping is or help you with what you're searching for. Getting to the hotel was a bit of a task as we used a bus from the airport. I would recommend just catching a taxi as carrying bags from half a km away with heavy bags (and toddler) and Causeway Bay's narrow and busy footpaths when you don't know where you're going is very difficult. About $320HKD between the airport and hotel. Bus was $40HKD per person. Also MTR (train) is close by the hotel but can get very busy, and the escalator broke down which made it extremely difficult carrying heavy bags and baby stroller. MTR at the right times can be a good and cheap way to travel. Good thing about the hotel is you can easily catch taxis even though there is a long queue for taxis outside Times Square. The hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the area, where to buy things and even other areas. Knowledge of english was very good. Room itself was ok. Size was fine. The sofa bed was a bit dirty and there was no spare sheets or blankets for it. The main bed which was queen size was a bit firm and so too were the pillows. The bathroom was nice enough but it really needed it's grout cleaned properly. View was of the streets which actually was good because I could see there was a fresh market nearby (live fish, live frogs, fruit etc) which was very interesting. The hotel itself had a few restaurants and we tried the Japanese Ousen restaurant which seemed quite reasonable on prices (compared to Australia) and service was good, even with our mischievous toddler. Actually all the prices compared to Australia were good - food, alcohol etc. There is a dessert restaurant on ground floor which was extremely popular with the locals - there were queues every night until they closed at 12.30am in the morning. The free breakfast offered was quite ordinary (and I didn't bother about it the last few mornings - went out for dim sum), however the staff were very friendly especially when it came to my toddler. You had a few choices and things on offer were burgers, cornflakes, instant noodles, friend noodles, croissant/ham/scrambled eggs, fruit and a few other things I forget. Yes, I would stay there again as it was close to everything and generally good value for money.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNothing Fantastic\u201d", "Author": "Jianz", "ReviewID": "UR135131370", "Content": "Was here for a night's stay after dropping by HK from SZ.

Room wise, it's really a normal room with nothing to shout about. A tiny CRT television at one corner of the room, in front of the bed. Two problem with such an arrangement; firstly, which hotel in this era still uses a CRT TV? I mean the TV certainly serves its purpose but the screen is a tad tiny for my liking (I think it was like a 14\" or max 21\"). Secondly, the sofa bed which acts as a couch is 180 degrees from the TV and we all know that CRT TVs can't swivel! Condition of the toilet is average; rather clean, basic amenities were there but the whole toilet was a tad small. Looks like all Holiday Inn rooms are designed in this manner. The biggest problem was with the cleaniness of the room. When I switched on the hair dryer and accidentally directed it to the carpet, the wind from the dryer brought up a whole pool of dust.

If you need to do some laundry, try it at level 11 (if not mistaken), where you need to slot in coins. Also available is ironing board and iron. Breakfast is set menu consist porridge, eggs with croissants, Indonesian fried noodles, burgers etc that comes with coffee and orange juices. Don't expect good quality food here, just enough for you to stay your day. One thing I don't like is their Internet booking which I booked directly from ihg.com website. This is a getaway for my wife and me. I booked this hotel on Apr 4, 2012 with a price of HKD6,336 for 5 nights on May 1- 6. On Apr 29, 2012, I checked the price again in www.hotels.com, the price was HKD5,544! so I could potentially save HKD792! Made a complaint to both IHG and the Holiday Inn Express Causeway Bay, apparently, the reason given is due to demand and supply! so that means, even if you booked earlier, those booked later can save much more! Will I come back to this hotel? Maybe....don't expect all the perks and goodies from a full fledged hotel!", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach CA", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, compact but Clean\u201d", "Author": "DaveLB", "ReviewID": "UR130210288", "Content": "This past trip to H.K I again stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Causewaybay.

Now, at least in February 2012, the hotel has started offering late checkout for HI top tier guests. The free breakfast is on a set basis. In most cases the order is forgotten though and after a wait someone will ask, what had been ordered - and will say sorry. This morning I counted at least 10 persons working in the breakfast lounge and it all appeared somewhat disorganized. The breakfast menu offers five choices, from western to local. This is ok tough, in comparison with having to line up for a meagre buffet (such as in many European and North American Holiday Inn Express hotels.) A transit tip: The walkway in tunnels from the MTR train to the exit under the Mall is huge. I usually switch to tram in the Admiralty station to avoid the long uphill walk in the tunnels (longer than, say, the comparable tunnel walk at Green Park station in London, if going to the Holiday Inn on Piccadilly.) From the tram stop the walking distance is much less, though on the other side of the Mall.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cBest budget hotel with greatest location\u201d", "Author": "inxpekto", "ReviewID": "UR123893934", "Content": "this is the only international chain budget hotel from the Intercontinental group that is centrally located in the middle of Hong Kong.

There's an access by using the handicap pathway in which I find that the hotel should cordially inform the guests instead of wondering around the hotel to locate it. Afterall, this is what basic hospitality is all about. Good points and tips: -receptionists are quite professional and not agitated by demanding guests asking about the whereabouts around the city. Perhaps a visible tour desk will help. -room size is adequate and comfortable for two people. There's a foldable/sleeping sofa for the 3rd person. -free high speed internet but am not sure if it has to do with my paying rate. -good quality bed. Twin bed rooms are always closer to the lift while all other queen size beds are away from the lifts. - clean sheets and good lines and basic toiletries -very centrally located in HKG, Don't expect any views other than the views of the bustling wet market which I find amusing. This is Hong Kong. -hand sanitisers in front of lifts. things that needs the attention: -a lot needs to be done for a better breakfast menu. Perhaps a hot instead of lukewarm coffee, fragrance porridge instead of watery porridge, a slightly better ham and sausages is also good. -do not pursuade the guest to join the Loyalty Programs. -proper eye contact and speak english slowly. Overall impression: Highly recommended it as it has a comfortable living setting. Basic courtersy is observed. Efficient housekeeping if you need more toiletries or water, good highspeed internet. This is m 3rd time time staying here as the location is better than any other 5 star hotels I can think of. because it is closer to the real sights and sounds of the real Hong Kong. Surroundings: There're a condom shops as well as condominium sales office, 7-11 to supermarkets, local coffee shops to Starbucks, side street sales to ultra luxury brands.

The bathrooms were lovely, clean and modern with a large shower and a powerful water supply. The hotel entrance at street level is a little off putting, queues form for the local Chinese dessert restaurant and you must take the escalator to the first floor to the reception check-in area. This too is used by the public who can eat at the 4 restaurants located on the first 3 floors. Staff were helpful and friendly and all spoke good English. There are 3 lifts which serve guest rooms only and these are fast and efficient. We were given a room on a smoking floor which smelled, so asked to change - no problem. The corner rooms are slightly larger than the other rooms with duel aspect windows, we were lucky enough to be moved to one of these. The internet room on the first floor provides free internet access to all guests and is well equipped as an office. This hotel is popular with main-land Chinese people who come to H.K. shopping or on business, so most people only stay for a couple of nights. Breakfast in included but is very poor, a choice of congee, noodles, fried vegetables etc: or the English option which was scrambled eggs, usually served cold with a slice of toast or a croissant, plus coffee and an orange juice. We only used our breakfast coupons a few times, but most hotels in H.K. do not include breakfast at all. The hotel is very centrally situated in Times Square and is ideal for the M.T.R. (underground train) which is 2 minutes walk away. For the price we paid (hotels in H.K. are not cheap) I would recommend this hotel, and I would certainly use it again, but don't expect luxury, just a basic, clean, modern hotel with very obliging and helpful staff.

The reception is fast and efficient, just dont expect any friendliness or smile. The rooms are ok considered the price, small and no thrill but fairly clean which works fine. The bathrooms have been renewed recently so look quite clean as well. Overall rooms are typical no thrill business hotel so dont expect anything fancy but if it s just to spend the night, then it works. Breakfast is included but I would avoid it. You get to choose between different western or chinese set breakfasts, but they are all pretty much horrible. All in all it s not a bad hotel but its location will or will not work for you depending on your business in hong kong.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cLocation Is Everything -- And the Only Thing\u201d", "Author": "stevesomething", "ReviewID": "UR120586785", "Content": "This property is a bit worn around the edges, but what would you expect?

The rooms seemed small and stacked, that you can hear the activities of the next room or even kids running outside your room in the corridor. At a time when most hotels have switched to the LCD TV, the Holiday Inn Express still uses the tube TV. The beds are comfortable but the basics are there. Extras like a comb, shampoo or conditioners, bring your own or buy it at Times Square. They use this one-for-all kind of soap. Its a soap, shampoo and conditioner.

Hotel staff is very helpful with directions and patient with all our first timer queries. All amenities available, shampoo, toothbrush, towels etc and clean. Hotel also has an internet room. Good to check out and plan your trip further if needed. Took the MTR to Disneyland, had a jolly good time and shopped around the hotel area the days after. MTR station in Times Square. Next year, Hysan shopping is coming up as well. My wife can't wait for the next trip. Breakfast is at level 3, with 6 choices. Generally acceptable food. Those who is tired of it can just walk across the other side to the wet market area and get dumpling / wanton noodles, roasted goose/ duck / pork etc. Real convenience. Lunch: Just walk around, loads of choices. Dinner: Check out the Japanese restaurant in the hotel, good food at reasonable pricing. And plenty of other restaurant in Times Square opposite. Plus there is McCafe across Times Square. Also must check out the dessert shop on ground floor of HIE. But please avoid Superstar Seafood in Times Square. Plain Chinese food at exorbitant price, poor service and noisy environment. Street side dumpling noodle and fried rice is way better.

Initially we were given a smoking room, which we did not want. It was noticeably smokey smelling, so the next day we asked to switch, and the HI Express staff were very gracious about letting us do so! The carpet in that room felt sticky and overall did not have a very clean feel to it. The second room we were switched to was on a no smoking floor and was much better. Everything felt a little more clean than the smoking room & no smokey smell. The beds are pretty comfortable and the linens feel clean. The bathrooms are small but overall pretty clean. The drain in our sink did drain slowly. The location is awesome, right across from Times Square, which has great restaurants including a Starbucks, California Pizza Kitchen, Tony Romos, etc. A short walk to Outback, short walk to Victoria park and the harbour (about 10-15min). The breakfast is okay, a few times our eggs and bacon seemed too undercooked, but the staff is accommodating & friendly if you ask for them to fix it. Western & HK options.

The Causeway Bay MTR station is literally across the road. The hotel is loacted at the back of TImes Square and the station is under Times Square so travelling was really never a problem. The staff was very sweet and always willing to help out. The complimentary breakfast was very basic. It is a set menu and has five different options. We had the vegetarian option which was basically oatmeal/cornflakes, fruit and youghurt. But one can order toast separately for $10 as well. Coffee/Tea and juice is also served with the breakfast. Enough cannot be said about the cleanliness of the place. It was super neat and our rooms were always well made when we returned from a tiring day out :) It is perfect for people who're going to be travelling out a lot in the city. It not a posh and fancy place but I believe it is excellent value for money. We also used their airport shuttle to get to HKIA on our return. It cost about $130 per person and was very convenient. Also, because of its location you will find a lot of eating as well as shopping options around.

Hotel is literally across the street from the Times Square shopping area. Upstairs in the mall, there is a food forum and fine restaurants...all very delish. The Causeway bay areas has shops and eateries will stay open past midnight. Great for overseas travelers still jet-lagged and looking for things to do. We were out and about the majority of the time, so the room was only used for sleep and shower. Location was very important for us. Hotel is simple, no frills.The rooms reminded me of college dorm rooms. Small by western standards, but big enough for 2 adults and 1 young child, and 3 huge suitcases. It could be cleaner, but overall not bad. Extras like bottled waters, toothbrush/paste, and room slippers were replenished daily. We saved the extra slippers to bring home. We did not try the concierge or used the hotel staff much...we knew what we wanted to do, where to go, and what to see. So no comments on the hotel staff. A business center was available with free internet and computers ( we did not use.) No wi-fi in rooms, but free broadband is available and worked fine when we used it. The hotel also provides complimentary use of electrical converter...you can ask downstairs for extras. The set breakfasts were not as bad as per some of the reviews. For Westerners, it may seem daunting, but pick through what you like (fruit, yogurt) to hold you through the morning...then chow on the good stuff for lunch and dinner. Choice of set breakfasts included: A) Congee with cuttlefish balls, man tou (chinese steam bun) B) Bacon, scrambled eggs, toast C) Macaroni soup, scrambled eggs, toast D) Beef satay ramen noodles E) Pasta with sauce (this one was not very edible!) All meals come with tea or coffee, orange juice, and sliced fruit. You will need to request for butter or jam/jelly. We strongly recommend this hotel if you are the traveler looking for a decent place to stay with a great location. Tips: 1) Set meals are popular in HK and a good value, usually offered for lunch. Examples: - California Pizza Kitchen located inside Times Square mall offers set meal for $88 HKD. Includes salad or appetizer, individual pizza or meal salad or pasta, and a drink. - NAHM vietnamese/thai fusion is very good. We ate at the location in Kowloon. Set meal includes choice of salad and noodle dish for $88 hkd. Add dessert for $28 hkd. 2) Hailing taxi from hotel may be a challenge. Go to the taxi stand in front of Times Square where lots of taxi's await. 3) Causeway Bay MTR station is under the Times Square complex. It is about 3+ stories below. It's still a bit of a hike, even with the escalators, but you'll need the walking with all that good food! 4) Check out the supermarkets inside Times Square and other mall/MTR complexes. It's a cultural experience to see the different types of food and small eatieries available. They even offer durian and other exotic fruits. 5) Macau is only an 1hour ferry ride away. The Dragon ferry company is new and very very clean.

The pull out sofa bed(foam mattress) is comfortable enough for our 10 year old. The rooms are clean. The only complaint I have is there are sometimes holes in the towels and bed sheets. They're clean but just passed their prime. Not a big deal though. They have internet facilities in the lobby area (5-6 PCs) which is very convenient. The breakfasts were basic; but it's free! It's nice to have the breakfast available especially when the kids get hungry early in the morning. We usually go for a snack a couple hours later. CitySuper is located across the street and they have a great \"supermarket\" and food court (wonderful desserts).

A lot of thoughtful amenities which make your stay a lot more comfortable, We were there for 8 nights. Do ask for a higher floor room for better view.

Later, after returning from a day spent in 35 degree weather, I tpook another shower. I saw a maid in the hall and asked if I could have yet another chaneg of towels. She said \"Surely\" and was most pleasant about it. So I give the staff \"A+\" rating all the way round. There is no bell staff, which may be part of the \"Express\" fpormat at Holiday Inn.

The bathroom seemed to have been adapted for wheelchair users - i dont know if all bathrooms are like this - and was very spacious. The shower enclosure was huge and the shower itself had the pressure of a jet wash!!! Broadband in the room was a decent speed. A nice size fridge in the room came in very handy for us. Breakfast - Had breakfast the first 3 days we stayed there. We both had a western choice each time. Servings were not huge but not tiny either - compared to UK. By the 4th morning, neither of us really felt like eggs or oats again so from then on we had breakfast at a variety of nearby places. This is not a reflection on the quality of the hotel food itself as it is decent but it can be a bit hard to stomach the same food each morning.

We took our own iron but there is also an ironing room on the 11th floor for all guests to use.

The rooms are a bit small (and not a square inch is wasted in the bathroom layout). But, the rooms are very clean and comfortable, and the bedding is akin to what you would find at a luxury hotel. In-room internet is free. Small refrigerator in room (and not a mini-bar, so it actually has room for things). Most rates include a free breakfast . . . the breakfast is good but a bit light. TV includes several English channels. Room rates are very good for what you get . . . you're paying for your room, not for a fancy lobby, a fitness center, or a swimming pool. Exercisers can go over to nearby Victoria Park and use the jogging track there. Location is ideal - convenient to MTR Causeway Bay Station, more shopping than you could possibly want, food options galore (from a street fruit market 100 steps out the door to fast food to casual dining to fine dining). On my most recent trip, I arrived early at 11:30 AM . . . I expected to drop off my luggage, go kill some time, and return later for my room, but much to my delight, they let me in my room at 11:30. Beware that the hotel is very difficult to find, which can be especially frustrating when you're toting heavy luggage around in the sometimes oppressive Hong Kong heat & humidity. So a first-time visitor should be sure to bring a very detailed map of the area with the hotel plotted on it . . . the maps you can get for free in the airport arrivals hall have the hotel labeled in its location, but an even more-detailed blow-up of the neighborhood might help you. The hotel is located along a narrow street behind the Times Square shopping center, and the signage in front is certainly not prominent. Use MRT Causeway Bay station, exit A, and turn left when you get to the top of the last of several escalators. One minor annoyance is the hotel does not give out the usual hotel soap bars and mini-shampoo bottles. Instead, there are two dispensers -- one by the sink, and one in the shower -- that dispense an all-purpose liquid soap/ shampoo.

The room was fair size, clean and had a sofa which was also a pull out bed. The furnishings were simplistic and modern. The bathroom was small but thats all it needed to be. It was clean and there were some ammenities available. I had to get used to using the soap and shampoo from the dispenser on the wall in the shower. That was different. I was pleasantly surprised with the complimentary broadband access in room and it was pretty quick (over 2Mb/sec upload and download) although I have since found out its meant to be complimentary at all HIE chains. For those without laptops, there is internet access at the lobby available. Laundering was also pretty economical when compared to the higher priced hotels. And efficient. I had it picked up the morning and was back early afternoon. The breakfast was nothing grand but it was enjoyable. You had a choice of 3 or 4 set menus ranging from local breafast like congee and dimsum to the usual bacon and eggs. Along with it came some fruits and a glass of orange juice, tea or coffee. Pretty solid to get the day going. In fact, I noticed one guest had both menus that morning. The portions were a little small for most Western guests. The TIme Square Mall is right opposite the hotel (where they filmed a scene for Tomb Raider : The Cradle of Life) and the Causeway Bay MTR is just a short walk further. Transportation from the hotel is pretty good with the MTR, buses and taxis all readily available. Just be aware that peak hour traffic around the hotel can be horrendous. Overall, I am pretty impressed by this hotel. It offers value for money and I think with its modern, simplistic design, its going to be one of my hotels to stay at when I am next back in Hong Kong.

Causeway Bay is a bustling shopping area, very convenient by public transportation to almost anywhere in Hong Kong. This is one of the prime reasons that we have chosen the Holiday Inn Express. We had a great rate due to the season (right after Chinese New Year). Also we didn't need a hotel bar/restaurant or other extensive amenities because my familiarity with the city.

It also has has a free internet lounge next to the reception desk. As well as an official Chinese travel agency available to help you book trips to the mainland. One word of caution is that taxi drivers and many locals do not know the location of this hotel, because it is only a few years old, and it does not have a ground level lobby. The lobby is on the second floor up an escalator on Sharp St., behind the Time Square shopping center.

On previous trips we stayed at 5 star hotels including the incredibly posh Oriental and the Ritz-Carlton. We decided to try this hotel for one night since our flight quite late into Hong Kong and we didn't feel like we should spend the extra money for the evening we arrived. Our original plan was just to stay there for one night and then transfer to the Mandarin Oriental Landmark for the following 2 days and nights. After our first evening, we decided to just stay at this Hotel. First of all the location of the hotel is just a few minutes walk from the MTR subway stop at Causeway Bay. Unfortunately it was a little confusing finding the hotel. The exit from the subway was at the Times Square Mall, a huge shopping center in Causeway Bay and the sign for the hotel was quite small and almost unnoticeable. Also the walk from the subway was a gradual uphill climb. In any event once you get to the hotel, checkin is fast and the reception staff very friendly. There is no bell staff so you will have to carry your luggage yourself up to your room. The hotel has 29 floors. The elevators were large and the wait time not so bad. The room we were given was very nice, large enough for 2 twin beds and a double sofa sleeper. The room was very clean and had a nice view of the city. There was a 20 inch television and a nice work desk for use. A plus is definitely the free high speed internet connection. There was no wi-fi in the room but I believe there is one in the lobby area. We were also provided 2 complementary bottles of water each night. There is an in-room safe and cotton slippers were provided. However there were no robes provided. The bathroom was small but the shower had hot water and good water pressure. They provide shower gel and shampoo in a dispenser in the shower. They also provide toothbrushes, shower caps, and sanitary napkins. The beds were very comfortable. At breakfast they provided us with breakfast vouchers. At breakfast they provide you with a choice of one of 3 set meals which includes orange juice and coffee and some fruit. The food was ok if not altogether filling, but there are many cafe's around the area, All in all, this hotel provides great value. While its not meant for people who want to be pampered like crazy or for a wonderful honeymoon, this hotel is great for most of us: a clean hotel with friendly service, free internet, and at a great location in Hong Kong for shopping and as a base to get around the city.

Location \u2013 Excellent ================ 1. Located next to Times Square. Exit A from Causeway Bay MTR station. Walk around the Salvatore Ferragamo shop corner and it\u2019s right there (on your left). Word of caution: The walk to exit A is a fairly long one. So you have a lot of luggage, my advice : Take the airport shuttle bus. It stops right in front of the hotel and the frequency in every 15 mins. 2. Easy access to shopping (Times Square, WTC, Sogo) and eateries in the vicinity. Lobby/Reception (1st Floor) ====================== 1. Take the escalator to the first floor, and you will see the modern looking reception. Check-in is efficient & business-like. 2. Forget about bell-boys, concierge (the reception doubles up) . This hotel is for the self-initiated & independents. 3. There is an internet corner with broadband access (accessible by guest card). It is like a study room, complete with stationery. You can have free internet access here. 4. There is also a China Travel Service (HK) Ltd travel desk, and an eatery, Dining Room on the same floor. 5. 3 lifts serve the guest rooms (the rest serve the restaurants within the same building) and the wait is very manageable. Other Self-Service Options ===================== 1. Laundry / Dry cleaning : You will have bring your laundry bag and complete the laundry form (from your room) and bring it to the Housekeeping Dept between 7:30 to 9:00 daily. Pick-up is at 19:00 to 23:00 Daily. 2. Ironing : Ironing Room is on the 11th Floor 3. California Fitness: If self-service is insufficient exercise for you, the hotel has an arrangement for you to work out at California Fitness\u2026.at the prevailing going rate. 4. Meeting rooms : 2 connecting rooms for small size functions are available on the 7th floor 5. Vending machine is located at lobby level & there is a 24-hour convenience store within walking distance. Room ===== I have a double bed, non-smoking room on the 28th floor (there are 29 floors in this hotel) overlooking Times Square, and I could even see the sea from my bay windows. Access to the room is by room card which doubles up as activating all the lighting. 1. The rooms are good size by HK standards and even compared to hotels from the Dorsett chain. The room is basic & well-maintained. The fluorescent lighting made the room look more functional rather than cosy. Likewise, the study desk light is a florescent too! The well-maintained carpeting lends some warm touches to the room. 2. Mattress is firm with lots of plush pillows. The sheets are of acceptable quality & clean. 3. There is a study desk with PVC-bound swivel chair and you may use the LAN cable provided by the hotel to connect on the internet on your notebook. The speed is slower than Tokyo\u2019s but is fast enough. I had some teething problems connecting but once the server was re-set, it\u2019s just great. It\u2019s even free. I experienced staying at the Four Seasons, Shangri-la, Conrad & Hyatt. Not only was I charged exorbitantly for internet connection, there were not as fast. They even provide an adapter plug in the room\u2026..how thoughtful! 4. The only stationery provided is a hotel notepad & pen. Don\u2019t expect any envelopes or any hotel stationery. BYO. 5. There is a hotel safe & torchlight (next to your bedside) and a LCD alarm clock. 6. Good size TV, with remote control. A total of 19 channels for you to choose from : 7 Chinese, 8 English (including BBC World, CNBC HK, AXN), 1 Spanish, 1 German, 2 Japanese. 7. Telephone : Has voice-message facility. Only 1 is available on study desk, not beside your bed or the bathroom. Corded (not cordless). 8. Cloths hangers/Closet/Drawers : The closet is small sized and there are no drawers in this closet or room. You find an empty fridge in the closet as well (strange). To sum it, closet space is manageable with a 2 or 3 days stay. There are clothes hanger hooks to hang your cloths. 9. Luggage rack: A foldable luggage rack is provided. 10. Bedroom slippers : They even provide bedroom slippers! That\u2019s a really nice touch! 11. Other nice touches : Hairdryer at study desk, kettle jug, cups & sachets of Chinese tea and coffee. 12. Air-conditioning/Heater: There is no heater option at all. The weather was freezing cold this Feb 2008. When I called up housekeeping, the hotel immediately provided me a portable heater which was very effective (both solutions & heating me up!) 13. Sofa : There is a sofa-bed set in my room. Staying alone in this double room bedroom is definitely not optimal! Bathroom & Toiletries \u2013 Well designed & functional ======================================== 1. Soaps/Shampoo take in the form of a dispenser, at the washbasin & in the shower. If you are particular about conditioning your hair, bring your own conditioner. Bring your own moisturizer too.. this is not a 5-star hotel. 2. Other toiletries provided : Disposable toothbrush with toothpaste, shower cap. 3. The shower is good size & sufficient power in the water jet. If you like baths, sorry this is not the hotel for you. 4. Bath towels : Clean and well-maintained. 5. WC: the door of the bathroom doubles up as the door to lock your WC. I applaud the optimal use of space & design. 6. There is no power point for shavers nor disposable shavers provided. BYO! Breakfast \u2013 Very order, organized & adequate! ==================================== I was curious after reading all the poor reviews about the breakfast. You get your breakfast coupon/s upon checking in. Breakfast is served from 7am to 10:30am at W\u2019s Entrecote (a steak restaurant from noon onwards). In typical efficient HK-style, you get to choose from 4 set menus : A, B, C, D. A & D are western options, offering croissants/bacon. B & C are oriental options offering congee or noodles. The breakfast turned out to be much better than I expected after all the poor reviews. I enjoyed the century egg/lean meat congee a great deal, the fried mini- spring rolls, the deep-fried mini pork bun, followed by fruits. Tea/Cofee & orange juice is included all the sets. Sure, it is for venue for feeding the masses but I would not likened it to being in a canteen. It is served in such an orderly & organized fashion that, if you are a late-morning person, you never have to end up eating leftovers (most hotels like to serve breakfast buffet style). CONCLUSION ============ I would pay the extra (compared to Dorsett chain or the YMCA) and stay here. Yes, even on business, this hotel is adequate enough. My type of hotel. Getting straight to the point and doesn\u2019t make a pretense of its limitations (which are few). How often to we use the swimming pool, anyway, if you are a single or a lone business travel? I paid slightly over HK$1000 for my stay. If you can get the room for less than or equal to HK$1000.00, I would say, \u201cTake it! you are getting your money\u2019s worth!\u201d", "Date": "February 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcestershire", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value for Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "Sfran10536", "ReviewID": "UR13153745", "Content": "As a family of 4 (2 teenage sons) we were travelling on holiday around Asia and Hong Kong was our first destination.

We wanted to splash out on better accomodation later in the hoilday. I had stayed at The Excelsior Hotel on Causeway Bay previously so I knew the area. Also I knew that our 5 days in Hong Kong would be spent seeing the place and not staying in the hotel. Therefore, I took a chance and booked this hotel on the web and what a good decision it turned out to be. Rooms : We had a large family room with a double bed, a single bed and a bed settee and a big bathroom that was actually layed out for disabled use. The rooms were clean, but basic. Really they were typical of a Express Inn / Travelodge in the UK, so we were happy with this. The location is on Sharpe Street around the back of Times Square, Causeway Bay and a hint and tip is to make sure you look for the Times Square underground exit at Causeway Bay. It saves walking with your cases on streets full of people. There were advantages to the hotel for my boys; free access to the internet by the hotel reception and there was a Pizza Hut in the hotel accessed via a seperate lift. The breakfast : This was basic but adequate. There was a choice of three types, either cereal and toast, cooked English or Asian. Staff: Were friendly and very helpful.

You can get from the hotel to Tsim Sha Tsui in about 20 mins using the MTR. We arrived at the hotel really early and didnt expect to be able to check straight in, but the front desk were overly helpful and managed to get a room cleaned straight away so we could get some much needed sleep. We had a doulbe room with sofa bed, it was more than big enough for us - lack of wardrobe/ shelf space but we managed. It was clean, tidy and peaceful. But who ever spends too much time in their room when in Hong Kong. Breakfast is not that nice if you go for the english option - theres a Starbucks on every corner so you can get a caffine fix there. All in all 9/10 you get what you pay for and a little more.

The experience we had is way beyond anything we ever had. LOCATION The location of this hotel is fantastic. It is right behind Times Square, all more the better to shop! And the metro entrance (note entrance) is just a few steps away, but you actually have to walk quite a bit of a distance to get to the metro station itself. Restaurants and cafes are plentiful around so no need to go hungry, in addition CitySuper (one of the local supermarket) on the lower ground of Times Square is open till late. CHECK IN Super speedy, although they stuffed up my reservation. We actually booked through the hotel website for a double non-smoking room but they gave us a smoking room instead. Did managed to changed it but we were told that we were lucky that there one room available for us...(as if it was our fault) ROOM Not much expectation, given this is Hong Kong. But this room is definitely a match box. The double bedroom is squeezed against the wall, and there is a wardrobe of some sort but definitely only have space for one piece of luggage. The other went under the table. I've stayed at Novotel Century and New World Renaissance, and this room is a quarter of their size. Mind you, the smoking room was much bigger. But hey, at HKD780 per night, can't really complain. And being on the 22nd Floor, we didn't hear much traffic and had a fantastic view of the building next door. BATHROOM This is the highlight of our stay. Yes, it very clean by normal hotel standard but Holiday Inn Express is relatively new. Obviously the bathroom is small, or I should say shower room as there isn't a bath. The best bit is that when you flush the toilet, it floods up along with some interesting things.....(YUCK). They did fix it eventually but definitely puts us off completely. OTHERS They do have ironing board on another floor if you wish to do some ironing. And as per any hotel prices laundry was expensive so we took it to the local laundry about 5 minutes walk who washes and fold our bundle of clothes for only HKD28.

It would have been fine for two but was a bit of a squash for three and we ended up with luggage stuffed under the desk. The third bed was a sofa bed which had a piece of wood running where you put your head and didn't make for a particularly comfortable night. The service was fine, the safe broke and they sorted it out reasonably quickly although we had a few communication problems with the housekeeping staff (they didn't speak much English, we didn't speak a word of Cantonese, but then that's our failing really). The location is good, right next to the massive Time Square shopping mall and next to an MTR entrance although it was a 10 minute walk once in the station to actually get to the trains. Now the subject of breakfast! There were 3 options while we were there, which were the same every day. I was quite prepared to try the Chinese style breakfast, although the thought of noodle and pork soup first thing in the morning didn't appeal to my friends. This was pretty nice. The sausage, ham, egg and toast option looked and tasted like a bad airline breakfast. The third option, which admittedly none of us tried, was salad and baked beans (!!?!!) and seemed a slightly bizarre combination for us Brits. So if you don't mind noodles it's fine, otherwise get a croissant in the mall across the road. We never had to queue for breakfast although when we left each time the queues were quite long. All in all it was fine as crash pad with no frills.", "Date": "October 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGood budget option\u201d", "Author": "cs2thecox", "ReviewID": "UR5776947", "Content": "Stayed here with 2 friends for 3 nights at the end of August. The room would have been a good size for 2, but was a bit of a squash once the sofa bed was folded out for the third, but I guess that's always to be expected when you have 3 people in what is fundamentally a twin room! Everything was clean, the shower was nice and powerful, and they give you free toothbrushes. We found the staff helpful, and they let us settle the bill the night before we left so we didn't have to worry the next morning when we were running for a flight. The breakfasts were a little bizarre, but for free you can't complain! Two pieces of toast, scrambled egg, orange juice and tea are enough for me... I ignored the rather suspect-looking sausage and ham. My friends went for the Chinese option - soup noodles and steamed rice with pork. Apparently really tasty but not something I could face for breakfast. The one criticism would be the vegetarian option... salad with baked beans. Hmm. Might be best to ask for the English breakfast with no ham and no sausage! Great location just round the corner from the Times Square shopping centre, lots of other shops, and the MTR station. And, booked direct through Holiday Inn's UK call centre, worked out at just under \u00a325 pp pn. Bargain.

It turned out to be a great hotel in an excellent location, right next to the Times Square. We took the Airport shuttle bus where is located at B1 in the airport to our hotel. It cost HK400 for two people/round trip. Make sure to stop by at the airport information desk and ask for coupons if available before you purchase the tickets at B1. We found that it was more convenient for us to take the shuttle bus than the Airport Express, because the Bus drops you off right at the door. With the Airport Express option, you still have to walk to the hotel with your luggage after exit the station. Although you will save more time by taking the Airport Express, the cost is about the same. There are many clean and inexpensive restaurants located on the underground level of the Time Square shopping center. When you get out of the hotel, walk through the park garage where is right across from the street of the hotel, turn right at the end of the garage, and then take the escalator to the underground level. The hotel staff was very pleasant. I agree with the review below that the hotel room, power showers, and the room conditions are just great. Be sure to take advantages of the free internet access in the hotel lobby. We actually liked the breakfast. Because the food in HK is so inexpensive, we really did not want to fill our self up early in the morning, so we enjoy the good food for the rest of the day in HK.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farnham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and room\u201d", "Author": "EmmaB79", "ReviewID": "UR5580524", "Content": "This was our first visit to Hong Kong and a friend suggested staying in Causeway Bay.

The hotel also has free internet access for guests in a room near the reception desk. Only downside was the breakfast - not worth bothering with at all.
