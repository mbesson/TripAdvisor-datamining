I first stayed in about 1998 (probably a year or so after it opened) and this end of Robson Street felt a 'little out of it'. In the intervening 14 or so years Yaletown has come of age and the hotel is very much in the heart of it. Designed in the shape of a Grand Piano (hence the name) it has about 30 floors and almost all suite style accommodation. Each suite or studio is well equipped with a moreoless full kitchen and all of the usual Westin goodies (Heavenly bed, Heavenly shower etc). The 'Hidden' bar & lounge on the lobby level serves breakfast buffet, lunch and light dinner with an imaginative menu and good service. After a long flight from London a simple plate of fresh asparagus with grilled chicken and a glass of pinot blanc is a perfect dish to combat jet-lag. The 'super-foods' buffet breakfast is packed full of fruit, berrys, smoked salmon and other goodies to set you up for the day.

Upon arriving, I was greeted by and exceptionally professional and friendly staff who gave me the best room available as I requested. The evidence of it was in the room as I had a high floor with a breathtaking view of Library Square, BC Place and a beautiful skyline including mountains. My room was very clean and the bathroom amenities were of high quality. I really loved the leaf-shaped soap. In addition, the bathroom had a separate shower and tub which I thought was a plus. The shower was equipped with dual shower heads to accommodate various heights of guests. Other accessories included a mini-kitchenette including refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. And if you don't mind paying the ungodly prices for the convenience snack and drink products in the room's bar, they had more to choose from than I had seen in any hotel. The items ranged from a Kit Kat bar, juices, and soft drinks, to a variety of mini-bottled alcoholic beverages to large bottles of wine etc. There are however, two complimentary bottles of water, and two bottles of ungodly priced water. One bottle was $7 and it was maybe only 1 liter max. Maybe it has special healing powers or age reducing ingredients. If you're on a budget, just drink the tap water. It tasted great and was very cold. The bed in extremely comfortable and I slept like a baby every night. As it was my first time in Vancouver, I needed to find something to do. No worries, just head down to the ground floor and meet the kindest and most attentive concierge in the world. Not sure if I can mention names here but you will know who she is once you meet her. She knows the town like the back of here hand and will provide you with excellent tips on things to do and places to visit as well as give you very simple and detailed directions. She also recommended some great restaurants based on my preferences. She didn't steer me wrong. On the first day I toured the seawall (12 mile walk), on the second, I visited Granville Island and visited a dance club on Richards St; and on the last day, I visited Gastown to do some souvenir shopping as well as took a road trip across Lions Gate Bridge to visit West and North Vancouver. Needless to say, I had a great time and it was largely in part to her guidance. She is simply awesome! Overall, my stay was excellent. However, I did have a small plumbing issue... the water in my toilet overflowed. Had I realized it in time, I could have stopped it before if happened but I did observe it before the water spread to the exterior of the bath floor. I called express service desk and the issue was resolved right away and didn't reoccur. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return largely in part to the wonderful staff. No matter how nice a building is, it is the staff that dictates the atmosphere.

My boyfriend and I went for 6 nights after Christmas through New Year's, all on just 50,000 Starpoints (yay for the Amex Starwood card). While the hotel is all suites, some are pretty small, depending on what room you get, since the hotel is curved on one side (I believe the rooms that ended in 1 or 2 were the smallest, and that those ending in 3 or 9 were the largest). I'm sure the first room we'd been given would have been fine, but when offered the option to upgrade to a bigger suite with a king-sized bed for just $20 more per night, we took it and felt incredibly comfortable for the rest of our stay. It's worth asking if there are other options if you're not psyched with the first room you're given. The staff at the hotel are incredibly nice and accommodating, and they were happy to show us other possibilities. We slept really well, since the bed was so comfortable and the room got very dark when the shades were drawn, and we really enjoyed just relaxing in the suite at times and watching DVDs on the TV (which we had hooked up to my computer). The kitchenette, which was well-equipped with plates, silverware, glasses, and a variety of cookware, came in handy when we decided to be lazy on New Year's Day and order in Thai food (right to our room!). The elevators were admittedly a bit slow, but we didn't find it to be an issue - I'd just say try not to cut it too close if you're really in a rush. The fitness room was very nice, with several treadmills, a few other cardio machines, and weights. And the outdoor heated pool and hot tub, which are open year-round, were great to enjoy on the cool winter days. Finally, the location was one of the best things about the hotel: there were a lot of convenient things within just a block or two (train station to/from the airport, grocery store, liquor store, drugstore, Starbucks, Tim Hortons for some of the best doughnuts outside of Dunkin Donuts), and it was an easy to walk to a lot of other cool places with great bars, restaurants, and sites to see: Yaletown, Gastown, Chinatown, the ferry to Granville Island, etc. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be in a great central city location.

We're SPG Gold so I was hoping for a upgrade to a king suite (as opposed to the queen suite) and when there wasn't one available, they kindly provided free wifi instead. I was appreciative, but I also feel that there should be some sort of free Internet available in the rooms anyway. Even wired Internet wasn't free. The valets were friendly and fast getting the car each time, and over-all, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel.

This was one of the worst hotel experiences I can remember. We prepaid a 2- 2-room suites that were pricy because we were guaranteed views, breakfast, partial kitchens and large private outside balconies with a view of the city. It took hours to find our 2 reservations (even though we had our confirmation letters with us) and by the time they found our reservations our rooms has already been given out. We ended up in horrible rooms with no views, no balconies and an old uncleaned mini bar that had someone else's old food and drink still sitting it. The rooms were dingy, musty and completely worn. The bathroom was unpleasant with cracked tile flooring and not a single amenity except one small piece of soap. We were issued 2 thin towels each ad nothing more. No one at the front desk would do a thing to help. The concierge was horrible and had no idea what she was doing. She made a hair appointment for me at a salon that was no longer in business (it cost $25 in cab fare to find that out.) The same concierge that night then wrote down the wrong address for a dinner meeting which caused a problem. After two days, we cut our losses and checked into another hotel and lost the money we prepaid the Westin. Three weeks later we got a final invoice from The Westin Vancouver with an additional $420 in charges to my credit card and no explanation. I emailed and called the hotel several times for an explanation of the $400 in fees. A week later I got a voice mail saying the $400 was a cleaning penalty for smoking in the rooms. We did not know this was a non smoking hotel and there were no signs or notifications. Why didn't housekeeping or the manager tell us there was no smoking allowed when we were there? As it turns out smoking is allowed in the private balcony rooms (which we paid for and did not get) I don't think I would ever stay at a Westin again after this.

I am a government employee and staying here for on the government rate. Even after presenting the ID the hotel changed the rate during my stay.

She also added 5 different charges to my room including internet, convenience and more. Being in Vancouver for the first time, I really wanted to enjoy the city and my stay. Instead, I ended up being a complete stressball and spent many hours trying to resolve this. Ultimatley I had to call the SPG customer service in USA to settle this.

We didn't use the pool, but they had some sort of pool party on Sunday afternoons that is for the single 20 somethings of downtown. We went to the suspension bridge instead. To the hotel's credit, they have a plan B for kids. They offered to pay for a cab to go to another Westin to use the pool. I guess the pool party is not G rated. Sounds like fun! There is a grocery store and a liquor store withing a block of the hotel, which was great for us. We ate at their restaurant that has a tapas menu and we really enjoyed.

We arrived to the hotel on the 22.7 for one night. Everything was perfect. We had two rooms - one with a double bed + a single bed and one with a double bed. The rooms were not in the same floor. As we had to come back for three nights after our cruise I asked the reception to try to give us two rooms in the same floor during our next stay. She said she would try her best. When we came back, there was chaos. The male receptionist looked surprise when we asked him for two rooms in the same floor (no note has been taken of our previous request). He managed to gave us two floors in the same floor - 1107 (3 beds) and 1102 (2 beds). We asked if it was possible to get two rooms side by side and he told us that it was impossible. Ok. We left to the samll lobby while my parents checked in. As it was very early in the morning and the rooms were not ready we decided to explore Vancouver. When we came back to the hotel the receptionist gave us the keys to 1108 and 1102. We told her that we had room 1107. Then she realized that she has given our keys to my parents. That meant that we had to take all the clothes from my parents room (they are over 80 and well installed by then) and change rooms. We ended of course with rooms 1707 and 1708 and my parents in room 1702. What I do not understand is what they did not give us these two rooms when we checked in the morning. They told us that it was impossible to give us rooms side by side and then they give one of them to my parents, who checked in after us (!). Then the room with three beds had a double bed and a sofa(could be opened).

The bathroom had a bath and a separate shower cubicle. Two large flat screen TVs, mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, and sink. The outdoor pool area is accessed via the 3rd floor, overlooking Robson street. There are only a few (maybe 10) sun loungers which is too few - 20 would be enough though based on the number of guests using it. Be aware that the pool area seemed to be constantly used for corporate events, so we would be lying by the pool whilst the event was going on. On our last day of our holiday (the only day that we had planned to stay by the pool all day), the hotel closed the pool to hotel guests and made it available for a private party. Whilst I was initially very annoyed at this, especially as we had no advance notice, the hotel response was excellent. I went to the reception who had already made plans for anyone who wanted to use the pool to be transferred by free taxi to the Westin Bayshore pool, and a return taxi as well later in the day. The Bayshore pool was better and by the sea, so we were happy with that. Only thing i would say, is it would have been nice to know this alternative was available beforehand, saving the initial annoyance. So, my impression of the service is that it is very good, and the room standard was excellent. The lifts/elevators however, will drive you crazy! There are only 2 of them to the 30 floors of rooms and they are painfully slow. A 10 minute wait is not uncommon. All the guests were moaning about them. I think that the hotel must realise this as they have installed a tv on each floor next to the elevator, presumably to amuse the guests whilst they wait.

Vancouver's area of tourist interest seemed to us relatively small - walking distance city, which made the Westin Grand's location very central. Except for Granville Island, we walked everywhere. Relatively to the number of rooms the Westin Grand Vancouver has a pretty large lap pool makes it self very useful in the very few warm/hot days in the city. The multi strength machine at the gym really elevated my work out from what is normally just some cardio machines and free weights in hotel's fitness rooms. Concierge and bellboys had very useful information about restaurants and places of interest exploring the city. Generally speaking, the staff at the Westin Grand Vancouver were happy to assist, courteous and genuinely friendly. All-in-all, in this most beautiful North American city that serves as a gate to BC, cruises, busy airport connecting to the Far East and so many outdoor attractions the Westin Grand is certainly a hotel we will return to and highly recommend to others. Tips: * Dining in Vancouver (as well as in all of Canada) is more expensive than in the US for the same level of restaurants. We had an excellent meal at Goldfish in Yaletown that was worth every penny. The food was very nicely presented (and excellently prepare as well, of course). The wine list is acknowledged by Wine Spectator and the service is professional and yet charmingly friendly. * Canadian law prohibits (so we were told) preparing burgers less than well done. From our experience, skip burgers in Vancouver! * Vancouver is a sushi mecca. Prices of sushi here are lower than in NYC for fresh, high quality fish.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cgood for business\u201d", "Author": "mtrlgrl", "ReviewID": "UR116041494", "Content": "The rooms have a kitchenette, which is very practical.

You also have to take the elevator to the second floor to the lobby, or climb a number of steps. We requested a 1 bedroom suite and when we got to the room, found it to be a little cramped. It also had a very small patio overlooking other buildings beside it. The pool was a decent size, however by 4:15pm, the sun hides behind the surrounding buildings making the pool cold and shady. The hot tub beside the pool was very relaxing and not very busy.

If you were to walk to some of the great Japanese restaurants toward the end of Robson from the hotel, that\u2019s not for the faint of heart since it\u2019s about 10-12 blocks... BTW Save yourself the stomach ache and bad service, stay away from Hon's Wun Tun House on Robson. If you came to party, it would probably be a good hotel since it is close to the nightlife on Grandville. If you however bring your kids, I would recommend not staying here and stay at the Westin Bayshore instead. Since you are close to the nightlife, even on the 15th floor you will hear the street noise and sirens all night.

Each of the rooms have a slightly different layout, and I love that they are all suites with a kitchenette. There's a sink, microwave, dishwasher, dishes and utensils. I also requested a tea kettle and humidifier for my stay. The one thing to keep in mind is the bar fridge is not very cold. The bed is indeed heavenly, and it was a treat to have two flat-screen TVs, one in the bedroom, and the other in the living room. There was a desk and a great rolling table that I could pull up to the couch to do work while in front of the TV (productive, right?) The bathroom is completely acceptable. I liked the White Tea and Aloe toiletries, and the blow dryer was so terrific I emailed the hotel after my stay to find out the brand and model so I could purchase one for home. Lisa, the head concierge, got back to me right away with an answer, another example of how they go above and beyond for their visitors at this hotel. My only major disappointment was the breakfast at the Hidden restaurant. I totally expect that hotel restaurants are generally over-priced. However, their Omelette is $16 with two ingredients (not outrageous) and I was basically served folded scrambled eggs with maybe 10 pieces of tiny shredded cheddar cheese and literally one-and-a-half grape tomatoes (yes, outrageous). I didn't understand why I couldn't taste any of the fillings I ordered and had to pry open the omelette to see if anything was in there. Why the kitchen would go to such lengths to skimp on the ingredients is beyond me. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, but sadly I can't overlook my breakfast experience so I would not recommend dining at the restaurant.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cHappy here\u201d", "Author": "Emiwillseetheworld11", "ReviewID": "UR92044520", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights, wish we were there longer!

Stayed on two separate occasions and booked two different suites. The first was on the top two floors in an executive suite. Not the biggest but absolutely fine. On the 30th floor, so no balcony, which was a pity. Obviously great view but better to have an equally good view from a lower floor but with a balcony. Real point of the 'executive' tag was the inclusive breakfast. It actually just pays for a continental buffet but the restaurant staff are quick to tell you that you can use the 'value' against anything you want, so that's what we did. The extra each morning was just a few bucks if anything at all. We preferred the corner suite on the 16th floor. It was bigger and with a balcony. The single bathroom had two doors - one into the bedroom and one to the lounge with the sofa bed. It worked brilliantly well, so our daughter staying on the sofa bed was really easy. Good kitchen unit with microwave, sink and a dishwasher (that was really for the maid). There's a mini bar which won't keep anything cold, so you have to ask for a fridge which they will happily bring to the room. The single restaurant is a bonus for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food is superb and meant for sharing, so you never need to waste anything. But there's a market next door too open late, so you grab anything you want to make sandwiches or hot snacks if you don't want to spend a lot of money. Only minor quirk was the slightly course air conditioning. The first suite was generally too cold and too hot if you turned it off. Second was better and the balcony for the fresh air a major advantage. Aircon in the restaurant was also a small problem. We were all freezing after one 3 hour lunch, and hot drinks would get really cold quite quickly at breakfast. Location is great. Just a few blocks from Vancouver City Centre station, where the train takes less than 20 minutes to get to the airport. Definitely better than sitting in traffic in a taxi. Plenty to do on Robson, great restaurants and shops in the nearby Pacific Centre Mall, Sears, The Bay etc. A superb noodle bar just over the road. The hotel always has deals, so check them out before you book. We got the 5th and 6th nights free on the first stay. Most importantly, the staff are brilliant.

Yeah, you got it, NO ONE WOULD! So I told them to give me back my old room. At this point, I was told to return my free breakfast voucher!!! How is that for TREATING a GOLD preferred guest? I have never ever been treated like this at ANY hotel let alone a Westin! I wrote a note to complain and never heard from anyone at the hotel. Next time I am in Vancouver, I will stay at the Sheraton Wall Centre. They upgraded me for FREE to a club floor and their club lounge is amazing!! By the way, this hotel has TWO elevators for the entire hotel. NO club lounge. Because of this horrendous experience, I would never stay at another Westin as a SPG guest. I will stick with the Sheraton where they treat you well. This Westin made me feel as if I was a charity case!

Once the whole hotel was evacuated, in the middle of the night don't forget, we learned that the fire alarm went off because of a water leak on one of the top floors which short circuit the fire alarm....all...night...long. So there was absolutely no chance of sleep, and this was after climbing up the 21 flights of stairs again. This was all on New Years Eve so not only was the holiday ruined for us, but their was drunk people in the streets being obnoxious while we were definitely not in the mood.

One small criticism is the number of elevators. In the mornings / evenings you can wait an age. Ok on the lower floors,as you can use the stairs but on the 17th, this was not an option. We returned to the hotel very early in the morning following the cruise, but there was no problem at all with an early check-in.

It seems since the Olympic Games, Vancouver hotel prices have risen at least 100 percent. The Expedia deal was fairly good, and travelling with the in-laws, I booked two suites at well below advertised rates. The hotel is on Robsen Street, which as you know is the heart of Vancouver. Very easy to find, checking in was a breeze. The front desk was very friendly, efficient, and had an upgrade to a bigger suite all ready to go. The lobby is very opulent, clean, and smells of white tea. The elevators are express, and whisk you to your floor in seconds. This was nice because most hotel elevators in Vancouver are cramped and slow. Entering the suite, we found it was in perfect order. One bedroom through the hall and bathroom were magnificent, with dual shower heads, marble everywhere, and nice bath amenties. The living portion had a giant flat tv, as did the bedroom. Temperature was already set to 68 degrees. Mini bar, kitchenette, and fridge, albiet cost prohibitive, were in very good order. We checked out the facilities on floor three, and found a very well equipped fitness room, dry and wet sauna, a nice sized lap pool, and jacuzzi. You may order food to this level until 10pm, and it does make for dramatic views of Robsen Street and the surrounding city buildings. As with any Vancouver hotel, parking is really a drag...at 24.00CAN there just is not anywhere in the city you can park for less...so I accepted the fee with a minor grumble. We did not dine at the restraunt this time, but I was able to query a couple just coming out who said it was too expensive for them, but remarkably good. Several other couples mirrored the same sentiment. I travel to Vancouver a lot, and I recomend a short three block walk west to the Lennox Pub at the Corner of Robsen and Granville. This is a fun and very traditional Irish Pub that strangely plays Reggae music....which is delightful. Dinners and lunch are fairly priced, and our entire dinner party loved the fare. A special note: The servers here were fantastic, cute and cheerful.

Best Western, not even.\u201d", "Author": "jsazaki", "ReviewID": "UR63179149", "Content": "Disclaimer: I want to say as a precursor to this review that the night I stayed here was booked with travel points. I don't know whether or not this makes a world of difference because it shouldn't--FUN FACT: travel points are often collected by spending money at hotels, so as far as I'm concerned I'm a paying customer and would like to be treated as any other. Long story short, don't spend your points here just in case this is the reason why my stay here was so horrifyingly bad. My mother and I came to Vancouver for a week and had one night where we planned to stay at the Westin. I am in my twenties and my mother is in her fifties, we are quite well traveled and come from the east coast (where things are faster and seafood tastes cheaper). I'd like to think that we both represent two typical but diverse demographics of patrons at this hotel, and who are not at all picky when it comes to accommodations, as it is said often: nobody travels just to sit in their hotel. This hotel is well situated, I guess first dibs on the sweet digs is one of the few bonuses to being a part of a multi-billion dollar hotel franchise. The restaurant in the hotel (at least for breakfast), is fine. Service is attentive, blah blah blah you can probably find better brunch somewhere else but it's passable. So yeah that's pretty much where the good ends. We check in at 9am and are very surprised to be presented with our room key, since we were planning on leaving our bags and checking in at the 3pm check in time (I called the night before, and was told curtly that they were operating at 100% capacity, so : ???) We get in, and realize that our large window faces into a parking lot underneath and condo windows several meters away, once again, no problem-- Vancouver has nicer views elsewhere. We requested two double beds and were instead given a single queen sized bed. Once again, no problem--we could just share the bed for a night. Then we realize something: our room has no chairs. At all. There was literally a bed, a table, and what seemed to be a half completed kitchenette with the doors ripped out. So I call downstairs at around 10am and ask them if it's possible to switch to another room because I figured it's not like my breathing contaminated the living space or anything and I haven't yet removed my pants to wander around the room aimlessly and jump all over the bed. Plus, it was 10am, none of today's new guests have even checked in yet. The gentleman on the other line tells me more or less that it sucks that I'm shafted with this chairless bedlacking room but he can't switch my room because it would be unfair to the other guests who will not be arriving for another 5 hours or so. He reiterates that the hotel is operating at full capacity like I'm supposed to feel sorry that they're making tonnes of money and actually doing their jobs or something. Fine, whatever so we leave all our stuff in the room and head out for the day. Upon returning to the room we found two chairs set up, which was a nice alternative to sitting on our one queen sized bed. Then we found out that none of the lights work, the room didn't have any sort of garbage bin or soap (no big deal but still come on), and that the fridge was broken and smelled like rotting fish. The 'engineer' who brings us lightbulbs and another fridge to store our now turned milk laughs and tells me that there are 6 other fridges broken downstairs, like it's funny. Okay so I'll skip to the end, I don't think I would recommend this hotel to anybody. I'm happy that the other people on Tripadvisor have had a good experience here but honestly my experience here was not only the worst out of any other Westin experiences, but even worse than a good handful of hostels in Capetown. Is expecting a Westin hotel room to be ready with a chair and a working lamp too much to ask for? Seriously? 'Service Express' was pretty quick to bring stuff to solve the problem, but I'm here to travel efficiently, not to play build-a-hotel-room and certainly not to spend my entire freaking day pleading politely on the phone like a moron for light bulbs so I can use their 15 dollar a night internet.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, California", "Title": "\u201cLOVED it!\u201d", "Author": "Jenna_2000", "ReviewID": "UR62039110", "Content": "One of the best hotel experiences I've had; enjoyed every minute.

It was very small (with the sofa bed pulled out, you really had to squeeze past it), the shower door was poorly fitting (so it leaked a bit) and the AC was very noisy (and wasn't working at all when we first arrived - they fixed it quickly). We were also very near the elevator, the noise of which kept my wife awake. Having listed all my complaints, I have to say that the staff were very accommodating. Upon our request they moved us to another (slightly larger) suite, and comped us the very good breakfast.

The check-in was 1 floor up the marble stairs and took all of 5 minutes. I liked the security process in the elevator where you have to swipe your hotel room key to gain access to your floor. The restaurant and lounge (Aria) are one in the same. The hotel website makes them sound seperate. My wife had the duck which she said was amazing. I had the seafood linguine and it seamed like it was prepared in a haste. The noodles were only warm, not hot. The seafood was laid out over the noodles, not mixed in. We really enjoyed the buffet every morning which had been included in the price of our room. There was plenty of fresh fruit, pasteries, cereal and muffins to choose from. And for only a small surcharge, the smoked salmon eggs benedict was delicious, as well. The entire hotel staff was very friendly and always offered directions to wherever we were heading to that day. The valet would have our car waiting for us even though we always called down right before heading out of our room. We experienced no more than a 60 second wait for the elevators at any time. We didn't try the spa or weight room. As for the room, the view was just amazing. We had room 3109 which is a corner suite with balcony. We could see the harbour/grouse mt. on one side all the way over to Mt. Baker and Burnaby in the distance on the other side. We never saw housekeeping but the room stayed spotless. We would have breakfast then head out for the day and the room would be made up before we returned at 5pm. Then we noticed after dinning out every night, there would be fruit and water on our table and the room would be tidy again. So they must stay very busy. There is both a tub and shower in the room, as well as a small kitchenette. The tub also comes with a pull out shower head to rinse off the soaking suds. Our stay was made even more enjoyable due to catching 4 days of no rain in April, quite a surprise. I would definitely recommend this hotel to even my closest friends and family. We have stayed a number of other hotels in the area, but this is the first time we found one with a corner suite balcony and a tub. The kitchenette was just a bonus as we enjoyed the starbucks coffee in the morning and the hot tea at night. Oh, and lastly, I should mention that if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs or leave the music playing at night as the emergency vehicles at night travel with full sirens on.

My one gripe was a lack of storage space for clothes (but then this is a problem with hotels wordwide - they only ever provide enough shelves/drawers/hangers for one person even though their rooms can be occupied by up to four people. Very annoying). Other than that, we thought this was a total bargain - I would normally expect to pay about three times what we did for a room and hotel of this quality. The staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful, wtih a special mention to Jesse who works in the Aria restaurant and was a great guy - friendly but really professional at the same time.

I called for room service one night and she said it would take 40 minutes but the food arrived in 10 minutes. Quick! The location is fantastic.

Internet prices were outrageous in the business center, but I have yet to find a hotel where their not. The rooms themselves were beautifully appointed, clean, and comfortable. Nice views, but surrounded by tall condos and apartment buildings so remember to close your drapes at night, the curtains alone are too thin to keep people from seeing in. If your high up enough you'll need not worry about street noise. I found the thermostat difficult to operate and should have come with instructions, but maybe it was just me. The spa was fantastic and safe, for use only by hotel guests or locals with a key card. All equipment and facilities were functioning along with the steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi. It seems like at some places one or more of these are out of order or closed for cleaning. Outdoor pool was operational but too cold for swimming.

It's a great bonus to have these kitchenettes in all the rooms... with the IGA Marketplace supermarket next door it was handy to be able to get breakfast supplies for the mornings. The beds were super comfy, the room had everything we needed, it was spotlessly clean, and overall it was very good value for money. On the second stay, there was no free upgrade but we were offered a paid upgrade to a King Superior suite at an extra cost of $30CAD per night. We accepted this and was glad we did... if you are offered the upgrade at that price, snap their hands off because it's a steal. The King superior suite was like a condo / flat, with a balcony, a small living room, hallway, kitchenette, large bedroom, and large bathroom. I could honestly have lived in there. The only small hiccup was a blocked toilet on the first night, but maintenance were there within minutes and fixed the problem promptly. The Westin Grand is superbly located at the Eastern end of Robson Street, close to BC place, and only a 6 minute bus or cab ride, or a 10-15 minute walk to all of the restaurants clustered further West around Robson / Thurlow.

Bear in mind that we brought 2 large suitcases, 1 medium suitcase, 1 small suitcase, port-a-cot and a pram for 2 adults, 1 x 2 year old, 1 x 7 month old for a month long holiday - through out Canada. Upon opening the door we were concerned... Where was all our luggage going to go? Where was the port-a-cot going to fit? Where will put the pram when it's not in use? Where will the kids play? How will we all fit? It was late when we got there and we just made do. The views from the 25th floor were fantastic! We looked right up Robson St, towards Richards and Seymour Streets. Very handy IGA supermarket 2 shops down. The rooms are perfectly presented. Bathroom was huge. Separate shower and bath. In fact it was so big, this is where we but our two large suitcases and the pram, when not in use. It also had a handy clothes line/ string thingy. The suite had a dishwasher (no powder - house keeping does it), microwave, sink, toaster, coffee maker, 3 setting of dinner plates, bread & butter plates, bowls, cups & saucers, glasses, large slotted spoon, egg flipper & ladle, chopping board, glass mixing bowl, plastic jug, 2 sharp knives - big & small, and a mini bar (filled to the gills with all the stuff you want and somethings that come in really handy). You have complementary use of an umbrella, which you can buy later if you want. You also get a tea towel and dish cloth. Large desk with comfy ergonomic chair. The double sofa bed was well used. The tv in the lounge and the tv in the bedroom operate out of the same ill fitting cabinet, shelf above, shelf below job. The bedroom is separated from the lounge by noisy opaque glass doors that don't really do much at all. The king bed was brilliant! I think it was feather topped and the 4 pillows were all feather, 2 firm, 2 soft. My issues... They never changed our bed sheets until our baby was sick all over the bed 4 days into our stay. Our dishcloth was taken on our first day there and never replaced, and our tea towel wasn't changed at all. You couldn't secretly watch tv in the bedroom without it disturbing our 2 year old (in the lounge room) because the speakers were in the back of the telly and glass door blocked no light at all. We couldn't keep the temperature in the room even. The heating came on then air-conditioning, then heating, then cooling. We all ended up with colds, you get warm, kick the blankets off, only to have pull them back on again, all night. And when you had the doors shut (so our baby could try and nap), one room was hot and the other cold. We had one of those interconnecting room door thingy's also. We heard every conversation that our neighbors had. The room was a tight squeeze, especially when the sofa was pulled out. In fact you could say that it was about as wide as a pull out sofa, with a very little room to walk past it. The first thing we had to do each morning was put the sofa bed away. No where for our kids to play. We had to make toast in the bathroom. Our stay was majorly effected by the size of the room and house keeping. We spoke with another couple who had 1 baby (not 2 like us), and they said that they demanded a different room. I asked the bell man if all the rooms were as small as ours (when we checked in), and he said they were, but... They have different configurations! The other couple kindly showed us their new room. Such a better layout than ours! Grrrr! We didn't raise our issues with the hotel. I didn't think we could because we had got it through Hotwire, not directly.

I gave this hotel four stars and I stand by it, it was a decent hotel but the decor is quite dull and similar to many other hotels I've stayed at. I own a business in Vancouver but commute to town by ferry and I occasionally have to stay in town if I have to work late, this time my event was canceled and my wife and I ended up having a pleasant night on the town. The location is superb, it's right across the street from the main library (unique architecturally and well worth a visit in my opinion), and walking distance to everything from the Art Gallery to the Convention Center. This is also a rather unique part of downtown in that there's plenty of meter parking on the street and it's not very sketchy so I didn't feel stupid leaving my car on the street all night. Why do I mention this? The hotel parking was over $20.00 a night, the parking meter's are about $2.50 an hour but you don't have to pay from 8:00pm until 9:00am, this piece of info may or may not save you some money depending on when you arrive and depart. The hotel looks and feels much more like an upscale condo than a hotel, frankly I don't like the look or vibe but that's just my own opinion (more on this later). There is no lobby on the main floor, you have to taken a staircase or an elevator up one floor for this. The doormen were very friendly and explained this to us within a few seconds of us walking in. Reception was fast and friendly but we did have a little surprise when the a woman walked out of the room we had been assigned to as we were about to walk in! The woman at reception was very apologetic (I think the guest had already checked out but hadn't given up her room key yet or something), anyway we were quickly assigned a new room which was an upgrade to a one bedroom suite with a king sized bed in the bedroom. The room was perfectly adequate with a small living room with a sofa, a couple of chairs and small coffee table. There was a fairly ingenious kitchenette set up tucked away in a closet but I couldn't see it being that helpful for cooking. There was a small sink, a microwave and a dishwasher, be warned that the only fridge was the mini bar which was already full of costly snacks so if you were planning on doing grocery shopping you'd be strapped for fridge space. (probably a good time to mention that there's a full service grocery store called I.G.A. just a couple of stores down). By far the best part of the room was the bathroom, it was unusually spacious for a chain hotel with an enclosed shower seperate from the bathtub and with two really nice massaging shower heads too! I really don't like the look that a lot of upscale hotels are going for, when I walk into a lot of rooms (this one included) I feel like I'm at a show suite for an overpriced condo development. That said the styling really worked for the bathroom, it looked very sleek and expensive and my wife loved it as well. The bedroom was fine with a decent sized closet and a comfortable bed although my wife and I both struggled to find a comfortable pillow, there were a lot of them but none of them were very comfy! The only other thing would say about the room is that it's stocked with fantastic Starbucks coffee and tea! We didn't use the restaurant but I've heard it's very good, we didn't interact with the staff much but every one we did talk to was professional, friendly and competent. Although I wasn't wowed by the room itself I would hardily recommend this property. I've lived in or Vancouver all of my life and I love the city, but the downtown has a lot sketchy areas even in places you'd think would be nice. This hotel is located in one of the best possible locations, there was not a panhandler or squeege kid in sight! This part of downtown is very residential, the hotel is surrounded by highrise condos, which means there are always lots of people walking around even late a night not only does it make it feel very safe to walk around at night, it's also a very pleasant vibe.", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cLove the suites and great location.

The hotel has the lobby on the second floor, so when you enter you don't see it right away. From what I understand this is meant to give you the illusion that you are walking into an apartment building and not a hotel. It is supposed to make the place feel more like yours than theirs. Interesting idea, didn't bother me. Some reviewers I've read though really did not like this feature. The rooms are great. We had the most basic suite with a small sitting area, a seperated bedroom (both rooms had large floor to ceiling windows and televisions), and a well spaced bathroom. There is also a closet kitchenette that is kept behind two large doors. If you never need to use it, you don't notice it even there. The fitness lounge in the Westin is fantastic. Plenty of equipment and free weights. Was never so busy that you had to wait to use a machine. Had nice features such as ice cold lemon water (it's soooo refreshing after a good sweat). There was a decent sauna we took advantage of once and I believe there are steamrooms as well. One of my absolute favourite things about this hotel was the outdoor pool. It's on the third level (the workout lounge overlooks the pool) so you have a great rooftop view of the city. My bf and I went everyday and it was always empty. I guess being so close to the beach, people would prefer to catch their rays laying on the sand...but if you want to avoid the noise and crowds of english bay - DEFINITELY take full advantage of the Westin pool. There's also a hot tub which was great on colder nights. All the great amenities Westin is famous for were all included...for example 'the heavenly bed' and our favourite 'the heavenly bath' which has two shower heads (one is turned off to save water, but you can turn it on if you want the full luxious experience). The staff at the hotel were very kind and helpful. Everyone seemed in good spirits and they were always looking out for the customers best interest. My bf and I loved the fact that there was a grocery store, a mini mart, and a liqour store conveniently located at the base of the hotel. Made getting last minute items very easy. Not to mention that being on Robson was fantastic. Don't listen to anyone who tells you that it's an 'unsafe area' to be in. It's really great, you are always just a short walk from everything you'd want to see and anywhere you'd want to be.

It was obviously hotel staff because I was the only one with access to the room. It's no big deal but was curious. I would recommend staying here for business as it's quite pricey.

We missed the entrance to the hotel to park our car and had to drive around for quite some time to get back. Many one-way streets, plus no left or right-hand turns during specific times of the day, coupled with extensive construction made an around the block ride into a five-minute ride. Once there, however, they came out pretty quickly to valet the car and get us up to the lobby. The hotel has 30 floors and two elevators; suffice it to say that you will have long waits during your stay. The lobby itself was unremarkable and small. I didn't find it all that inviting. We had a corner deluxe suite that felt more like a little apartment than a hotel room. We really liked it. There is a smallish bar / kitchen area behind double doors off the hallway upon entering. It had a small sink, microwave, dishwasher (if you can believe it), and mini-fridge. The refrigerator had items for purchase, but there was a little bit of room to put some food in. The living area had a couch, chair, TV/armoire unit, desk and chair with floor-to-ceiling windows. Off the living area was a small patio for lounging with a view of the city. The bedroom had a queen bed and TV/armoire unit. The room was pretty small. It would be nice if they upgraded to king beds, but I don't know that the bedroom would hold it. The bed itself was comfortable and the sofa in the livingroom was a pullout. The bathroom had separate sink and bathtub, vanity with plenty of storage space, nice toiletries and plenty of towels. The bathroom opened to both the bedroom and hallway making it very accessible and adding to the feel of an apartment vs a hotel room. All of the hotel staff were very pleasant to us, always saying hello or good evening whenever we met. The concierge (Lisa) is really good at her job. This woman knows Vancouver and can get you around quickly. We had many requests and all were answered to our satisfaction. She really adds to the hotel. Vancouver is a nice, clean city with a bit of a European feel. We really enjoyed it. There are tons and tons of restaurants. Every meal we had was good regardless of the price. In fact one of the least expensive meals we had was by far the best. We went to Granville Island and I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. If you want fresh produce, it's great; otherwise, I wasn't too impressed. They say it isn't touristy, but it is....

It is an easy 20 minute car ride from the airport, which should not cost more than $30 (Canadian $). When we stayed at the Westin we had a rental car but the location is easily accessible to TransLink buses. Parking is $21 per night and valet is $24 per night. Each time we requested our car it was brought up promptly. The hotel has 31 floors with all of them being classified as suites. Our room did not have a 2nd room but did include a small wall unit with dishwasher, toaster, microwave and cooking/eating utensils. This is very helpful for people who wish to make their own food in the room. The top floors (30th and 31st) are home to the executive suite rooms and are only accessible to guests saying on those two floors. The guest rooms are only accessible by two high speed elevators. Although the elevators move fast, the amount of people coming and going (especially during peak hours) means you will be waiting upwards of 5 minutes or more for an elevator. To access the guest floors (2 to 29) you must use your keycard to unlock the floor buttons. This feature offers security and keeps unwanted persons off the guest room floors. On the third floor there is a \u201cWESTINworkout\u201d room (fitness center) with treadmills, stair climbers, free weights and several multi-exercise machines. There is a unisex sauna off to the side of the gym. Both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s washrooms have steam-rooms. Access to the outdoor lap-pool and whirlpool is also through the gym. During our 5 night stay, we found the hotel to be excellent with very attentive service. One thing that I was not satisfied with was the lack of a free high-speed internet connection. In room internet access was available for $14.99 for 24 hours. Considering that most hotels (even lower priced ones) off nower it, surely a Westin property that charges over $200 per night should at least have free access somewhere in the hotel. Even the business centre requires guests to pay to use it. I recommend the Westin Grand Vancouver hotel for travelers looking for an upscale experience who do not mind paying the extra price for it.

The valet parking is $25 CAD per day. The 3rd floor contains a fitness center with a nice view. It's smaller, but it faces the outside deck that houses the pool and hot-tub. There is a steam room in each locker room as well as a shared sauna. There were no extra charges to use these facilities. The only real negative to this hotel is that only two elevators serve the entire building. So, it can be a wait to get to your floor or lobby during peak times. We only had to wait in a line once. At most times, the wait seemed comparable to any other elevator wait. This hotel hosts a number of passengers who have either arrived or will depart on an Alaskan Cruise.

The room we'd reserved through the Internet-only, prepaid (read: \"cheaper\") rate wasn't ready yet (it was 30 minutes before official check-in, so no problem there), and they tried to get us to upgrade for $30 more a night to a bigger suite.

Check-in was an absolute breeze - very friendly staff, recognized my Gold status and gave me a complmentary upgrade to room 2700 - a 1-king bedroom deluxe suite with a view of False Creek and the B.C. Center. Great nighttime view in my opinion! The suite was small, but was one of the best Westin properties I have ever stayed at. The living room included floor-to-cieling windows as did the bedroom which were seperated by a very small hallway and doors. The bathroom had a DEEP soaking tub and a seperate walk in shower. The suite was nicely furnished -very modern & comfortable. The kitchenette was hidden away by what seemed to be tall cabinet doors. They opened up to reveal the sink, dishwasher, toaster, microwave, flatware & tableware, and coffee maker. Very impressive and an excellent use of space. The room service staff was wonderuful and genuinely friendly. The food was delicious. Even the burger & fries were to die for - perfectly cooked & purposefully seasoned - just great. The staff were all very hepful - I can't say enough about how responsive they were to an air conditioning issue that I had which was resolved very quickly end effeciently. Great service. The location is wonderful - right at the edge of Yaletown. One should be warned, however; that there are many construction projects going on (for the 2010 Olympics?) which includes two specific build sites adjacent to the Westin. The weekend was quiet as construction was halted, however; Monday morning we could hear and see jackhammers, cranes, dumptrucks, and backhoes working from fairly early in the morning until the evening. From my Suite 2700, the noise wasn't so terrible, but those staying on the lower floors might beg to differ. Vancouver is a small city (compared to my home Los Angeles) and is quite easy to get around on foot, by bus, cab, or ferry. The hotel is on the edge of Yaletown and I really did not have any concerns for my safety at all whilst I was walking in the area at all times. The only time I felt semi-uneasy was when I was walking near Chinatown at night which really isn't in the best neighborhood, but still it's about a 15 minute walk northeast of the Westin.

The Sutton Place won the contest hands down, even though I had a standard room there and a so called \"deluxe suite\" at the Westin. The Westin Grand is tall, new, and oddly shaped. The lobby is not on the ground floor, resulting in a rather unimposing street entrance that one could easily miss. I entered round the side where the cheerful and friendly valet parking ($20 + tax a day for hotel guests) and bell boys hang out. The lobby is accessed by a fairly long flight of stairs up, which are a bit knackering after a day trudging round the city, although there are elevators further into the building. The lobby itself is sort of like a modern gentleman's club only with no seating: just some rounded off corners, dark wood, a bit of marble, a bit minimalist. There's a restaurant/bar (Aria) on that level which had an interesting looking menu but there was noone in it. Check in, yes, again, it was OK but not awesome, as the Canadians like to say. Efficient but not over friendly. My room, an end \"deluxe corner\" suite on the tenth floor, was very weirdly shaped and I still can't decide what made it deluxe exactly (given all the rooms at the Westin are meant to be suites). There was a tiny entrance area with a closet and a tiny kitchenette consisting of a toaster, a microwave, a dishwasher and the ubiquitous minibar fridge. There was also a small ration of free Starbucks coffee and some paper Starbucks cups. Then there was the sitting room, which had a sofa/pull out bed, a desk, and a TV. The TV however was located opposite a blank wall, not the sofa. We thought that was extremely weird and uncomfortable, but later realised the room was so narrow that there wouldn't be space to pull out the sofa bed if the sofa faced the TV.... The bedroom... on the small side, not much space to move around. The queen sized bed was comfortable and had nice Westin linens. The TV had that very annoying thing where every time you turn it on you have to go through a promotional hotel rigmarole where they tell you about the bed you're sleeping on and all the movies they want to sell to you, before you are able to just tune in to plain normal telly. Also I noticed there was no CD player or DVD player: not even the clock radio could play CDs. Given how cheap these items are these days, I think four and five star hotel rooms should have them as standard (the Sutton Place does....) Wireless internet: all their hotel rooms have it, and it is a reasonably quick speed, but they make you pay $14.99 plus tax per 24 hours. If you want to surf, I recommend any Blenz coffee shop - there's one on every corner virtually - where wireless is completely free. Bathroom: connected to the entrance area and to the bedroom which is nice if you have a someone using the pull out bed in the living area. It was a little poorly lit but quite nice, with an unusually big deep bathtub for North America, and plenty of big towels, but the shower took some figuring out. Amenities - just Westin label shampoo, conditioner, soap which were not replenished- were OK, nothing special. But big plus point: there was a proper detachable hairdryer, not one of those awful tiny things chained to the wall that you all too often find. What else? I didn't use the pool or fitness room facility on the third floor although I did look at it. The fitness room was on the small side, accessed via a room key. Not many weight machines but the treadmills all did have personal TV screens which was neat. The (absolutely tiny) pool and hot tub were outdoor ( a bit alarming for Vancouver...) surrounded by grey concrete and some sad looking planters although there was promising looking steam coming off both in a very un-environmentally friendly way. The hotel offers a limited menu of \"spa\" services in a small locked treatment room, but for the prices they charge I would advise visiting another hotel with a proper spa facility (eg the Sutton Place or the Fairmont) if you are in the market for that sort of thing. Airport pickups: the Vancouver airport shuttle service does not drop off or pick up at this hotel. Instead you need to walk two blocks away to another hotel - or get a cab, which is about the same cost if there's two of you. Service Sub par. Bellhops aside (they are the best thing about this place) I thought the service was not great. Having been told that all we needed to do to set up the pull out bed was to ring the instant express service button (otherwise known as front desk, I suspect) to ask someone to come, whatever the hour, we did so at 11pm. At 11.45pm, we were still waiting. At 11.50pm I rang again. \"Someone will be right up, madam.\" At midnight, someone arrived, but without any pillows or blankets, two essentials which were missing from the room which I'd specifically asked for on the phone. Example two. We asked the concierge for a sushi recommendation. She sent us somewhere twenty five minutes walk away, and when we got there it wasn't even open. Example three. My final bill included mini bar beers and sodas that my companion and I most definitely did not consume. Then they argued with me about who else might have drunk them. The bill also did not include all three days I'd ordered wireless internet, and when I tried to point this out, the front desk person was quite abrupt in telling me the billing computer never made mistakes. Example four. What kind of Canadian hotel does not have pancakes and maple syrup on the breakfast menu? This one! Small things I know, but rather annoying and not really good enough. Lastly, a word on location. Some people say the location of this hotel is bad. I think the only reason the location might be bad is if you have lost all use of your lower limbs (in which you have my sincere sympathy) or if it is raining cats and dogs and you truly cannot afford the $4 cab fare to anywhere else in downtown Vancouver or Yaletown. The location is FINE. The Westin is on Robson St, which has hundreds of cool shops and eateries mere staggering distance away, and it is within spitting distance of loads of civic amenities like BC Place and the Art Museum and Crepe Express. I'd rate the location as much better than say the Pan Pacific or the Westin Waterfront or the Hyatt, and darn nearly as good as the Hotel Vancouver or the Sutton Place.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cAll-suite hotel in an ideal location\u201d", "Author": "banjo815", "ReviewID": "UR14132595", "Content": "This all-suite hotel has about 200 rooms.

That said, the taxis are not expensive although eating out could be. We can recommend \"Rosies on Robson \" a short walk from the hotel (less than 1/4 mile) for a good value meal. The sea wall at Stanley Park was badly damaged in storms last December and will not be repaired until next year,important, if like us, you like to cycle round it.

I contacted the property directly and obtained a special rate. As a Starwood Preferred Guest I also recieved a room upgrade (from a 'Superior' Suite to a 'Deluxe' Suite). Unfortunately, upon check-in, I was greeted by a very pompous front desk agent. He informed me that there was an issue regarding my special rate and that the reservations agent that I dealt with was new and inexperienced - thus had given me incorrect information. However, rather than being sympathetic, the agent was aggressive and indifferent. He made me feel like riff-raff. This is so un-typical of Westin employees. Check-in aside, I had an enjoyable stay at the Westin Grand. Here's the low-down on the hotel: Pro's: -Gorgeous entrance and lobby -A lot of room-types to choose from -The rooms are amazing (in terms of amenities: wet-bar/fully-equipped kitchenette, sitting rooms, separate bedrooms, pull-out couch, & the always amazing 'Heavenly Bed' etc.) -Bathrooms are great! Granite everywhere! The soaker tubs are so relaxing and the separate shower stall is very nice. -Location is great in relation to downtown amenities. -Rooms sizes are nice and spacious for the most part. Con's: -Service is sketchy. Some hotel associates make you feel welcome and appreciated - others (such as the man who checked me in) can make one feel like rubbish. I found the Service Express Agents to be very nice and helpful. -Decor is tasteful - but is kind of boring? The lobby is nice enough, but the rooms look muted and dull. -The TVs in the room are old and outdated. My room also did not have a DVD player or anything of that sorts. It also lacked a CD player of any kind. I was surprised considering this is considered a 'Deluxe' Suite. -Prices: okay, so nothing shocking here.. all hotels of this calibre seem to overcharge and nickle-and-dime on everything. I was charged $20 to borrow a CD player overnight and I paid $12 for 'breakfast' which consisted of 2 croissants (both the size of a finger) and 2 VERY mini pieces of banana bread. I got a free glass of ice water though. How generous.. geesh. Overall: I would probably recommend this hotel to friends and family. It isn't anything 'grand' or amazing, but it's new, clean, and generally quite nice. I would advise people to NOT book 'Studio Suites' necessarily, as they seem like basic hotel rooms (they don't feature separate bedrooms etc.).

This one was one of the best! We booked a few months in advance so there was no problems getting an available room using our star points.Although the suite was alittle small it was more than adequate. After reading many of the reviews, I was alittle nervous about the construction and the complaints about long waits at the elevators.... My suite was located on the front glass side and I never heard the construction and the view was breathe taking from the 29th floor! As for the elevators, I never waited for more than a minute or so. The service was great. Our AC messed up about the third day there. We called downstairs and someone was in our room within 10minutes fixing the problem. The conceirge service was a great help giving directions and ideas.The location was perfect. We were there for 5 days in September and we walked everywhere except for our trip to Granville Island,Stanley Park and Lynn Canyon in which we used public transportation (it was easy and inexpensive). The city of Vancouver has sooo much to offer. There's restaurants for everyone's taste, art, music, shopping, hiking, biking, museums, etc. By the way, if your looking for a great burger try Red Robin's. It's a trendy place within walking distance with good prices. Also Earl's was a chain type restaurant with a wide variety, good atmosphere, and also decent prices. If your a chocolate lover check out Death by Chocolate in Yaletown.....the desserts are wonderful! Overall this was one of my favorite starwood hotels. We have decided to make it one of our regular vacation spots. They will definitely see us again!

While the hotel was not completly perfect I must say that it is one of the best overall values I have found in my travels. First the minor negatives: The elevators are inadaquate. There are only 2 and the wait during the day is long and the stops are many on the crowded way up or down. The hotel completly messed up my room assignment but a little persistence cleared that up. However, if one is willing to accept a bit of a wait for an elevator one receives many things that few hotels in this price range offer. First it is the best location for walking in the city. Gastown, Chinatown, Yaletown, The Aquabus dock, the amazing Library, Downtown Shopping and Arts Houses, are all within easy (10 min max) walking distance. We were able to walk everywhere. The hotel is surrounded by inexpensive and excellent local eateries. As well as stores. The design and decor is clean and modern but comfortable. The baths are large and lux with seperate soaking tub and shower. The suites are large and comfortable with a small, smart, mini kitchen. It even had a small dishwasher. Also the kitchen was actually stocked with enough equipment to make a light meal. Even a toaster was included. Very impressive! It was neatly tucked away behind doors, not intruding into the room. The pool was decent sized and tiled, the surrounding deck was huge with both lounges and tables, there was a spa as well. Lovely modern design that clearly was integrated with the stunning Library across the street. A lot of good planning went into this Hotel and it shows. Large healthy potted plants enhanced it further. The workout area was excellent: large, cool, with floor to ceiling windows out to the pool. Good selection of cardio, a weight machine, dumbells, and streching equipment. Bath had a shower, steam room and was immaculate. I only had breakfast (every day) in the Dining room as it was included in my rate. The continental was very generous with many choices. For a nominal fee hot entrees were included. The fruit selection was vast and actually ripe. Many different carbs were offered including bagels and toast. Yogurt, granola, and juices were all available. The display was always lovely and never looked \"picked\" over. The same three professional waiters quickly recognized us after the first day and were friendly and welcoming. I don't understand complaints about the room itself. It is fairly large and graced with a very high ceiling and huge windows on two sides that look out on the tree-lined streets below. It was modern and elegant, full of great design details. Massive lengths of fireplace screens covered the windows, it was suprisingly effective. I think folks interested in clever design would like this room. It was not usual hotel dining room. The staff were all quite professional and response time was always good. My housekeeper was the same everyday and she knew me by name and knew what I liked. That is so Four Seasons. She called me Mr. William, you gotta love that. I have to single out Lisa, the head Concierge as truly excellent. She gave us a ton of help and suggestions and always got us good tables. She really went the extra mile to get us into the sold out fireworks spectacular. It meant a lot to us. She knew everything about the city. What a true pro, and no attitude. Now on to the view and some practical advice. We stayed on the top two Grandview Floors. I have stayed at the Pan Pacific (in a front facing suite) a Downtown Hotel, and the Delta Vancouver. None of them has a view as good as the one from our rooms. We could see everything from the Harbour to False Creek. It was truly amazing. I strongly recommend staying on a higher floor or springing for the Grandview Floors. Also, the 09 balcony rooms are by far the best. Frankly, there is too much of a disparity between these and some of the other suites in the same deluxe category. The balcony rooms on the other side are just as good in design and have decent but not breathtaking city views. The rooms on the curved side of the hotel are more desirable than the ones on the flat side. I would have had to pay 3 times as much to replicate this experience anywhere else in Vancouver and would not have had as good a view or location. Was this hotel as good as a Four Seasons or Ritz: not quite. Would it have been worth paying three times as much for a bit more service: no way!

We found it more useful to direct our \"Vancouver\" questions to locals on the street! The only major issue that we had was the construction in the lot directly adjacent to our room (facing north). It's not the fault of the hotel, but rather due to the rapid expansion of condo complexes throughout the city. It seems as if this particular construction project is neverending, as reviews as far back as last year, complain about the noise.

The biggest problem is one of scale: boutique generally means intimate spaces and personal service while grand generally means large public spaces and efficient, business-focused service. Calling this boutique hotel \u201cgrand\u201d sets an expectation that the public spaces, service and ambiance do not live up to. We enjoyed the modern, tasteful suite: it had a comfortable bedroom and a well-organized bathroom. Our corner location meant we had great views of Vancouver plus a small outdoor balcony off the living room. Unfortunately, this 30-story building has only two elevators, making a trip up to or down from the room a longer process than it should be for a hotel that aspires to be \u201cgrand.\u201d The constant grumbling of the other guests about the elevator reinforced our view that this was a legitimate problem. The small dining room/bar/breakfast space right off the lobby is trendy, but again, it\u2019s more boutique than grand and the resulting impression is one of trying to fit too much into too small a space. The hotel seemed to be understaffed much of the time, with the bellhops/porters serving as doormen, valets and concierges, often at the same time. Multitasking can be admirable in the corporate world, but it is rather challenging in a hotel that should place more of an emphasis on service.

Unfortunately this was our only \"grand\" impression of this hotel. We stayed for four days in a deluxe one bedroom suite. First I would like to mention that the staff at \"Aria\" were very kind and worked very hard. We had breakfast twice and dinner once during our stay. The food was very good. The menu is a bit limited. We waited almost an hour for breakfast on the day we checked out, they were quite busy. The room service menu is very limited as well. The conceirge (Lisa)that works full time there during the day was very rude to us. She did not smile and tried to brush us off as quickly as possible as though we were bothering her. We asked for information about dining and activities in the city. She told us one or two things in a very rushed tone and then rudely brushed us aside as though we were bothering her. We later found that the information she had given us was not totally accurate, which caused us some problems with transportation. During our entire stay we met two staff members who worked at \"Aria\" who were friendly. I can not say that any of the other staff in the hotel were friendly or welcoming at all. The bed and tub in the room were great (as usual) with Westin. The furnishings were attractive but very uncomfortable. The pool looked nice for swimming laps. On our last day at the hotel we had a few questions at the front desk. We were quickly \"blown off\" by the front desk clerk named \"Tara\".
