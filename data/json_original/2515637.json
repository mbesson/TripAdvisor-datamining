He read the reviews about the remodeling and hesitated to take me here. He even had a backup plan in case this was too much of a \"dive\" for me. I am so glad we stayed here! The Gold Spike far exceeded my expectations! Ifor the price we paid, it is exceptional. We stayed in a corner suite on the 7th floor, which had a wrap-around balcony with sliding glass doors on both sides. It was 98 degrees out, so we did not use it too much. The room definitely looked as fresh, new, and clean as the photos. There was even a huge showerhead and curved curtain bar to make the shower even better. We did not watch TV, but did use the free wifi. Our room had 2 A/C units and a dining table for 4. We played the $3 blackjack here as well...how often can you find less that? My husband appreciated Guinness on tap...and probably the dealers in too-short skirts. The staff were friendly, and the casino floor has clearly been remodeled as well. Recommend adding soap dish in shower and put 2 soaps in the bathroom.

I went to Las Vegas for a work related event. I did not want to spend a lot of money and found the price at the Gold Spike to be what I was looking for. I did not have high expectations because the hotel was in the older part of Vegas. I was plesantly surprised with everything about the hotel. The hotel staff was great and very friendly. A large group ended up reserving most of the rooms at the hotel so there was a little confusion with whether I was in that group and checking out with them.

First, this is a BUDGET hotel. If you want anything more than an inexpensive, clean, comfortable room than you need to look elsewhere. (It was nicer than some Motel 6 rooms I have paid more than twice as much for!) I was a little unsure what it would be like after reading some of the reviews on here but I was pleasantly surprised. It's 1 short block away from Fremont street which was a great break from all the craziness over on that block. The staff were all very nice and attentive. The room we stayed in was spotless and recently remodeled. New paint, new furniture, remodeled bathroom. The king-size bed was comfortable and the mattress looked brand new. The A/C was nice and cold. I saw staff constantly vacuuming and cleaning all over the hotel every day. It was shiny and clean everywhere. We had no trouble getting a parking spot in one of their 2 surface lots over the 4 days we were there (and it was Easter weekend). The diner on the 1st floor was great! Most entrees were around $6 and the portions were very generous. We ate there 3 times and it was always delicious. There is no ice machine but you can take the bucket to the bar in the casino and easily get it filled. The pool looked very nice but since it is not heated it was a little too cold for me to get in. We never saw any \"sketchy characters\" hanging around that other reviewers mentioned and the casino has visible security guards all the time. We never felt unsafe.

Seen many pullovers/ arrests/ police running after people with guns drawn. Most people walking in this area are shady - constantly asking for money. You really stand out as a tourist in this area, making you a target for crimes (just my opinion). The rooms don't ventalate well, the windows don't open and a/c turns off/on constantly.

There are no ice machines on the room floors, you have to go to the bar and ask for ice, which the bartenders happily supply. Self parking is not plentiful, there are only two small lots, I actually lucked out the times I needed to park and found a spot. Otherwise you will need to valet park. Valet is complimentary, but if you tip it's not necessarily free. The Gold Spike is about a block north of the Fremont Street Experience, it's not a long walk. The casino is pretty minimal, with something they call sexy blackjack (girls in skimpy outfits dealing 21) and some slot machines. I didn't eat at the restaurant but for club members there is a 6.99 prime rib special. I actually like the Cal deals or Tony Roma's steak and lobster special (get there early otherwise it's a 1 hour wait).

I paid $31 for hotel fees in the package already. I checked out the pool ...you'd think they would warm it in February...it was about 60 degrees outside.

Parking is limited unless you do valet, then they'll park in the city parking lot next to their lots. We were told the food in the Superbowl buffet was better than last year, well it wasn't....they had tacos last year. Guess for $9, you couldn't ask for much.

We were staying at another hotel (had i known about this one, i would have booked here!) and were walking around downtown Las Vegas near Fremont street and saw the Gold Spike. We are always intrigued in smaller places, we love what establishments such as this one has to offer as far as a little more quaint and not so packed that you can actually enjoy yourself. We went in and sat at the bar to play a little and have a drink. We sat there for a hour or two and then cashed out. The bartender was adorable! (my husband would say very good looking) She was very nice and accommodating. The security guard (did not catch his name) offered to bar back for her. This is when we started to realize what a great job they have all done with cross training their staff. It did seem everyone did just about everything. We then went over to see the games they had to offer and we sat at a few machines and played. A very nice waitress came by, Vangie, she was very helpful and when I cashed out after a few hours, she also paid me out. No ticket or coins to gather, they come to you and pay you cash! I had not expected this. She was Very busy, but she still kept her calm, professionalism and caring spirit. She was the only waitress/cashier person for the whole floor. We then realized, that we had been there for a few hours and really should have gotten a players card. We walked over to the players card area and the nice man helped us, he too was also security. He spoke to us about the casino and hotel and answered our questions, he was very knowledgeable. I am very sorry that I do not remember his name, but he for sure deserves a pat on the back, for not only going the extra mile, but also his customer service was exceptional. We were once again amazed at how all staff knew how to do all jobs. We then decided to eat at the caf\u00e9. With all of the choices in Las Vegas, we werent sure what to expect. We were seated and our waitress- Cole, was very nice and a little bouncy, lol but we enjoyed the conversation with her, a little banter and she made our experience worth staying. I did become upset however, a manager called her over and loudly spoke to her about not serving an employee, while she was taking our order. I agree that she took some extra time with us, we did have some questions as we had not been there before.

Oasis at Gold Spike had decent room rates over a booking website. That's why I choose it and not all reviews had been too bad. First of all \u2013 this hotel is located 1 block from Fremont Street. But there are lots of homeless and suspicious people walking around day and night. They will try to talk to you, especially black people. I would not recommend the hotel for women travelling on their own. I did not feel safe anytime. Neither for my car. They got 2 parking lots, both are tiny compared to the number of rooms they offer. I have read reviews about finding it difficult to park here. I arrived early, so I did not have a problem. The next evening around 7 p.m. I got the last space. Driveway is small, it's complicated to turn with big cars. They do offer valet parking, but you have to leave your car right outside the side entrance directly on the turn right lane of the street... The casino is small but ok. Nice bar and food corner. Lots of security around. The girl at front desk went out of her way to satisfy my special room requests. I got a room on 4th floor (from 7) in the tower, which is no real tower, and it was far from the elevators. The room was having much noise from outside: big airconditioning 2 floors down for the casino. Big cinema complex on other side of smaller street, probably with noisy airconditioning too, lots of policesirenes during the evening. Never had got such a noisy outside like in this hotel. There is a lot of traffic during the evenings as well, as there are parking garages situated around the hotel and Fremont Street. They have an annex with motel-style room with outdoor entrance doors facing the pool. As the pool was seasonally closed, it might have been more quiet there. Sure it is not during warmer days when people are going to have pool parties... I was a bit nervous as I had read some bad reviews after booking (non-refundable). But the room was ok. A bit smaller than motel rooms (no 400 sqm as they promise on the internet). With a kingbed the room left some space to walk up and down. Furniture is cheap and has a modern touch. Surfaces are covered with glass to prevent furniture (no real wooden one) from scratches. Walls are partly done in turquoise colour, so this looks fresh and nice. I would say the rooms are basic. If they were located in a quiet surrounding it would have been a nice stay. Rate was under 50$. The bathroom was tiny but ok. It's all newly renovated. Just my toilet was leaking at the bottom, water on the floor, but maintenance fixed it very fast. Bathroom is tiled, with a nice tub and nice toiletries, more than just a soap bar. After maintenance had been to my room, housekeeping came again to have a look and they were very nice and gave me some more towels. There is no fridge or microwave in the room, even no closet, just a small wardrobe beside the bed to hang some clothes on it. It's ok for a short stay. No ironing equipment as well. And there is NO hairdryer! As you get no information about the hotel when checking in, I cannot say if they have a laundry or not. The kingbed was firm and good, nice blanket buth after all thin. Old fashioned airconditioning under the window. There is not enought bright light in the room. All in all one lamp at the entrance, one standing lamp beside the desk (does not give much light) and 1 on each side of the bed. Walls are thin and you will hear people talking or coughing. This place will never be my first choice again. If town's politicians just did something to make people feel safer in the area, this might be a good choice for people on low budget. But I know they are having problems with weird and poor people walking around Fremont street since decades and can't solve that problem. My friends, living in Henderson, whom I visited, told me that downtown is a nasty place. Last week someone got shot. It is known as extremely unsafe. I did not see it that bad but maybe I should think about it. My friend did not want me to go there for the 2nd night, but I had already prepaid (50,- incl at weekend) I can recommend this hotel only for people who are looking for a basic room and are not afraid of more dangerous parts of a town, Gold Spike is just average.

Check-in was quick and efficient. My request for a specific room was honored, and the room was ready upon my arrival, spotless and all furnishings in excellent condition. Housekeeper services were very good, except one day when my room (and two others nearby) got \"missed\" when the regular lady had the day off. I waited over an hour for some towels to be sent up to the room. Had breakfast every day in the Coffee Shop ... excellent service, good food, reasonable prices!! The casino was nearly empty, but I had some good luck on the slots during my stay. Drink service was good. As mentioned by others, the machines don't issue a payoff ticket, so you have to wait for your winnings. (A minor inconvenience.) Parking continues to be a big problem, and to complicate matters, the lot was \"closed\" for two days so that a Halloween party could be held on the grounds. This forced registered guests to utilize a valet parking service. I simply cannot understand why management of this hotel refuses to ensure safe and convenient parking for hotel guests and patrons of their casino. Non-customers have the best spaces tied up while they wander Fremont Street Experience, particularly in the evenings If you are utilizing public transportation, the Gold Spike is a great choice .

We also seemed to have a temperamental toilet which flushed continuously unless you pulled the handle up after pushing it, although to be fair we never reported this to get it fixed.

We took this one since we are students and wanted to save money. That's why seeing a 44.90$ fee on your account after coming home kinda kills it for you. I just don't like to be tricked or having people trying to trick me... and that's how I feel now. We used tripres.com and we payed it said taxes and fees included. You can find GOOD OFFERS if you BOOK IN ADVANCE and some of the ads actually do say \"NO RESORT FEE\". You can get show offers and other bonuses included in your booking there as well. Now for the 9$ extra per day for what they call \"resort fee\". (just plain stupid) I've read about it and it's supposed to be for gym etc. which in this case consisted of 3 different kinds of running machines on the 2nd floor. (never used them) I would rate this hotel \"Very Good\" without this fee and I would probably have come here again without considering trying a different hotel if it wasn't for this. Initially we got a room hidden in a corner \"pool side\" at the 1st floor (out of 2, poolside only). The room gave the impression of a renovated basement. The TV was to the left of the bed which felt extremely inconvenient and the room was rather small with a view at ground level over the parking lot. We immediatly asked if they had any rooms with the TV in front of the bed and Lise-Marie (receptionist) suggested \"the tower\" which is inside the casino. This room was MUCH spacier and had a TV in front of the bed. She said that she liked the tower rooms better herself and I could understand why. The crew at the casino is in general very nice and helpful just like I read earlier in reviews and this was also one of the main reasons that we picked this hotel. The room had: a long furniture piece covered with glass that had drawers with space for some clothes. (along the TV wall) 1 Chair 2 bedside tables with one drawer. 1 Telephone Cable-TV 1 Bible There were some nasty looking stains on the bathtub that looked like mold but I would like to believe that it's something else because otherwise it would have been removed a long time ago. Also the handle to the bathtub was a bit loose and since it was quite unique in the way you turned it on we encountered some problems with turning it on. So we asked for help and you're supposed to kinda hold the handle in place and then rotate it. You'll see for yourself... I guess poolside rooms would be a lot of fun if you're there friday to sunday since they have a lot of things going on during saturdays. It had rained the day we got to the hotel and there were water dripping everywhere around the pool area and I immediatly disliked that area. The pool is outside the casino and tower building and it's surrounded by the poolside rooms which consist of a 2story tall rectangular building. So the pool is separated from the \"main\" building. I read that the pool was supposed to be freezing, it was not. It could however be a little bit cleaner. It's located one block from Fremont street so it's easily accesible. The Strip (Las Vegas Boulevard) is quite a distance away but there is buses you can take on the corner of Fremont street. It's located on the same street as the Gold spike parking lot that is closest to Fremont street. Speaking of parking lots, there's one close to the pool area and entrance to the reception and then there is one diagonally across the casino building. Parking is free but it was always a lot of cars even if we always found a spot. When it comes to shows and entertainment I suggest you get a tourist magazine/s the day you arrive because you can save a lot of money on shows there. They also have these magazines on flights so if you're flying check out the magazines there as well. ALSO on Fremont street if you walk from the Gold spike towards the Golden nugget you will find a ticket selling area that sells discounted tickets that are shown on a TV just outside the entrance.

The pool, however, was clean and offered a welcome respite from the over 100 degree heat. It should also be mentioned that cleaning staff put minimal effort in cleaning our room on the last 4 days of our stay. To the hotel manager if you are reading this: we stayed in room # 226 on 31 AUG - 6 SEP 11 and our room was barely cleaned for the last 4 days of our stay. The sweat-infused bedsheets were unchanged, and the bed was poorly made. The bathroom was uncleaned and the floor was unvacuumed. A pile of garabge was unremoved from the room as well. Needless to say I left no tip for the maid. Another thing that should be mentioned about the property. Their restaurant is decent for diner fare. I recommend the Philly steak sandwich. The slots (if that's your thing) pay much better here than on the strip with the EL Cortez down the street being the best if you can mind stepping into an ash-tray-like atmosphere. The Palms, with a swanky atmosphere, is rated only slightly higher than the El Cortez for slots but is a ways off the strip. I recommend the $7 daily bus pass to get around if you plan on partying. I will return again IF I can share the cost with a friend, otherwise, I can get a MUCH better value renting a furnished apartrment by the week.

I've rented there before and always a great experience. Its one of the \"old Vegas\" casino hotels from the Rat Pack days, yet its been remodeled and clean. Some of the old historic casinos I have stayed at are cheap, but pretty run down. The rooms I've stayed at are always nice. I call it Space Age modern. The color scheme is white, brown and kind of a swiming pool blue. Cool frame around the widescreen TV. The design is very classic and clean, but updated with an Ipod speaker. Very geometric and I like it. Me and my friend liked the room so much, we took some fun pictures. The rooms I've stayed at come with 2 small bottles of water, which is nice being the desert. I first stayed there because a friend of mine from Sacramento always stays there when he is in Vegas and I kept coming back. I have met Christina at the front desk and Billy security guy and they remember me each time I come and we talk. They have always been nice and treated me well. The bar has really cheap prices so its a nice place to come. The restaurant is also super cheap and good quality for the prices. They have a prime rib special which I like to get. I think I've eaten there every time I've stayed. And its open 24 hours. I've gotten the same waitress and she remembers me also, which is so nice, I should know her name but I don't. So anyways, clean, excellent prices, very cool style, friendly folksy staff that remember me. And its walking distance from Fremont Street and cool bars down there.

Pre-stay service was great since I am only 19 years old but they still allowed me to stay. I paid 600 dollars. The hotel has a really good location just a minute walk of Fremont Street and nearby attractions. Yet it is very quiet. The hotel has a nice, tasteful and well maintained exterior. It is very obvious that the building had a major make-over not so long ago. The interiors are modern and fresh. Check-in was quick and helpful. One thing I can't understand is why they didn't renovate the elevators. They look very worn and they smell bad. The room was nicely sized with modern decor and a comfortable bed. If you're staying on the second floor like I did you will have a spectacular view of the air conditioning. I didn't mind but I know some people do, Be also aware that you have to switch your airco off to get some sleep (noise). What I noticed was that my room (216) had no ipod-dock like advertised. I didn't care since I don't have an Ipod but it could be a major disappointment for someone who was counting on it. Bathroom was small of course but easy to use. Huge television was a big plus and is hard to find in this price-category. Cleanness was good but not great since I found some hairs that weren't mine in the corners of the bathroom and in the drain of the shower. You get shampoo and lotion BTW. Bring your own shower gel. Staff was friendly most of the times and very helpful. What I didn't like was that the maids begin cleaning at 9 am. Make sure you use the \"Do no disturb\" sign or they will wake you. The on site restaurant Golden grill is simply great with very very friendly staff and very delicious great priced food. Even if you don't stay at the hotel make sure you bring a visit to it. On site pool is great too, of course fairly small but it's a small hotel so the amount of water just seems to be right. It truly deserves it's name \"oasis\". Probably the best pool downtown after the golden nugget. BTW if you want to book an Oasis room ask if there are some pool partys... For obvious reasons. I was not allowed to gamble of course but the casino consists of less than a hundred slots and four Blackjack Tables with 3 dollar shoe Blackjack and the horrible 6-5 5 dollar single deck BJ. If you're serious about gaming take the 2 minute walk to the El Cortez where they pitch 3 dollar double and 5 dollar single deck games that pay 3-2 and have an 0.45% and 0.3% House Edge. Best Blackjack in Vegas. 3 dollar craps, full pay video poker and 5 dollar baccarat are also present. Of course they don't have dealers that look like hookers. This review sounds maybe a bit negative but I would like to point out that I really enjoyed my stay and I am trying to point out the flaws that other travelers might find important.

He had us in a different room within 20 minutes (well before check out time). I have to say that everything we asked the front desk for they took care of very quickly. The food in the diner was good for price and we ate most meals there. The casino was a little small as we do not play many slots, but it was good for a late night fix.

I didn't and lost out on being given a scratch off which include room upgrades...I learned this from another guest in the elevator and it was confirmed at the front desk.) I fell in love with the Gold Spike. I found my place to stay in Vegas. The rooms are recently renovated, the location isn't half bad, only a short block from the action on Fremont. The rooms were impeccably clean and the staff...all of them, were great. I read the reviews on yelp.com and here, I researched this place to within an inch of it's life because some of the reviews are a little sketchy. I stayed there for a week let me give you the honest truth. Vagrants? What vagrants? In some of the reviews it claims that the parking lots are crawling with bums all the time and it's in an unsafe neighborhood. FALSE!! I felt perfectly comfortable walking out into the parking lots at all hours and walking the block to Fremont by myself. For many nights I didn't encounter any vagrants. I did run into one, he gave me quite the sob story, he should have won an Oscar. I informed security about it and they took care of it right away. But I have stayed at other hotels downtown and that really is nothing out of the norm. Valet and parking. This hotel doesn't have a valet except on weekends. I didn't use it because there are two parking lots, one on Ogden and Las Vegas Blvd and one on 4th Street. They are both right next to the hotel. Using the valet just seemed really lazy. I was a little concerned about the parking situation, but I never had a problem finding a spot. Both parking lots look tiny, but there was always at least a space or someone leaving. Casino. It is very small, but it's a small hotel. It has everything you need. A bar, a little restaurant, security, slots, black jack (and the dealers are skimpily clad cuties that my boyfriend really enjoyed looking at!) Not to mention impeccably clean. It's very nice in there, with a modern, trendy feel, not a cheap, cheesy \"Old Vegas\" feel. Rooms. The rooms are not huge, but they aren't cramped either. They look just like the pictures on the internet. The water pressure is terrible though, but again, I find that in every hotel I have stayed in in Vegas. The beds are comfortable, the TV reception is not so great I find. I had a problem figuring out the alarm clock on the iPod docking station, I suggest bringing your own but maybe you are smarter than I am. There aren't enough hangers, only five, but there are lots of drawers and places to stash your things during your stay. The bathroom isn't huge and it's kind of weird that the bathtubs are on a higher level once you step into them, be careful stepping out of them after a shower because I am going to say that the floor is a good three inches lower than the inside of the tub and can be surprising. Huge downside is there are no refrigerators in the rooms and no ice machines you have to go to the bar with the white bucket provided for you if you want ice. There is only ONE outlet in the room as well and one in the bathroom. So with two laptops that needed charging and two phones. two iPods and a camera battery, my boyfriend and I had to decide what we needed to charge. Staff. I can't say one single bad thing about any of them. Alex who works the front desk, I spoke to him on the phone several times before my stay, I have to say is very accommodating and an asset to this hotel for sure. The manager did a good job hiring that one. He was extremely helpful during my entire stay. (I did have to switch rooms, due to a previous guest doing something unsavory to the commode resulting in a godawful smell every time the toilet was flushed and we couldn't take it anymore, they didn't question me, they apologized, and assigned me a new room right away.) I called ahead and spoke with Alex and requested not to be pool side, as high up as possible (fifth floor) with two queens, he made sure I got my way. My check in was with Lisa (Lisa Marie? I can't remember her name.) Anyway both check in and check out were lickety split fast. The security guys were always very friendly, saying hi and thank you goes a long way. They grab your ice for you when the bartender is busy. Any concerns you have, you can count on them to take care of the problem. Lastly, I want to compliment the housekeeping staff on the fifth floor. They were all very nice. They are people, not just maids remember to tip and again, saying hi and asking how they are doing is going to go a long way. They asked me which room I was in and if I would like housekeeping service, by the end of the week, they knew which room I was in, they asked me if I was having fun, if I was enjoying my stay. I am not sure if they do this with everyone, but they made me feel really welcome. I made it a point if I was walking past one to say hi, these ladies don't have an easy job, they have to deal with some pretty gross things on a daily basis I am sure, it is Vegas after all. Saying hi and acknowledging them makes their job a little more enjoyable probably. When I left, the three that were working all said goodbye to me, told me to have a safe flight and hoped I had fun. I felt like it was really genuine. When the housekeeping staff makes you feel welcome and goes out of their way, you know the hotel did something right by hiring really awesome individuals. Pool: I didn't go to the pool so i didn't get to sport my lucky bikini, but I did take a picture of it, it's open from 8am to 10pm, so basically you can swim anytime. It's private so no one is spying on you and it looks NICE. Not skeevy and gross at all. It looks exactly like the pictures on the internet. Location: It is right on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Ogden. It's just a couple of blocks from the freeway and only a block walk to Fremont...close enough to the action, but far away for it to be quiet. It's easy to get to with entrances on Las Vegas Blvd, Ogden and 4th street. Walgreens is right on Fremont for items that you left behind. The parking lots are easy to exit too. I know this was a long review, I hope it was helpful and convinced you to stay at the Gold Spike. You will get individualized attention and feel like a VIP, something the resorts on the strips cannot offer. You will get to know the names of the people who work there, it's not different faces every day, it's the same people offering great customer service. It's a small hotel, there is no shopping, you can navigate the casino with ease, you can see the doors from the elevator bank. It's clean, it's not run down and shabby. My boyfriend and I both agree, we will be staying here again. The value for our room can't be beat.

Anyway, I booked Oasis room, which is really an old motel that was purchased and renovated by GS a year ago. To their credit, they REALLY cleaned up the place. The room was obviously very small, and the layout of the room reminds me of a typical sleazy motel. But the room was newly painted and very clean. The biggest surprise was the bed. I had a king bed but it was VERY comfortable. The pillow was just the right size and firm yet soft enough for comfort. I give this room a very high mark, considering that this used to be a dirty old motel. They really did a good job, I thought. The pool had a nice layout, but I was disappointed that it was not heated. The water was ICE COLD to the point that it was very uncomfortable. Another minus was they don't have a hot tub either. Also, if you stay in Oasis room in the pool season, one downside is that it would get very loud from the people splashing around in the pool as it is right outside Oasis rooms, and all Oasis rooms are directly facing the pool. On top of that, they had a band started playing by the pool while I was there, so the music was blasting through my door all night. Needless to say, I left the room and stayed away until they finally stopped playing around midnight. So when you book an Oasis room, just make sure to ask the hotel if they have any pool party scheduled during your stay. In my case they didn't tell me in advance, which I thought was a lack of courtesy on their part. Did I have to pay the resort fee just so that they could blast loud music that nobody was really listening to until very late at night? The casino at GS is so small I wouldn't even call it a casino. It's mostly just a few rows of slots. They do have few Blackjack tables, but they are closed most of the time. When they were open, the tables were crowded. Another minus for the GS casino; they hand pay. It's not like I'm a busiest man in the world, but I would hate to have to wait 15 minutes for a cashier person to bring me my $2.50 winning from a penny slot. A major bummer. So I spent all night playing at El Cortez across the street instead. Golden Grille, a 24hr diner at GS, was surprisingly good, especially their $5.99 steak dinner after 11:00 pm special was awesome. No, it's not a fancy four-star feast, but the steak was nicely done, just the way I wanted, and the service was very good as well, with a friendly chef and a cheerful waitress girl. Overall, my stay at GS was a mixed bag, unfortunately. I'd give high points for how they really cleaned up the place as a whole. But I must take few points off for some of the flaws, like how they charge you the hotel fees, the pool not heated, a noisy party without informing the guests, and the depressed casino situation. Still, for an average of $20 - $30/night they're charging for weekdays, I'd say it maybe worth it. But paying $90 for a noisy weekend night at Oasis motel? I must say you'd be better off staying somewhere else down the street. In any case, they should really rethink about the room charge structure, if they wish to get a consistent stream of return businesses. I'd stay again, sure, but strictly on weeknights and not in a pool season.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zwolle, Holland", "Title": "\u201cLoving the spike\u201d", "Author": "Jasperw", "ReviewID": "UR111946871", "Content": "The location is great: downtown.

The outside still looks square, bricky and outdated, and you have to walk to the back of the small casino in order to find the check-in desk. But the outside is clean and well-manicured. There is a choice of rooms in the \"tower\" (main building, with elevator), or around the pool (more motel-like, with stairs). We were with a large group, and according to one in our group, they gave away her non-smoking room even though it was prepaid, so all that was left was a smoking room when she checked in. The rooms around the pool area were almost exactly the same, right down to the picture hanging on the wall. It was pretty bare, but very, very clean. No desk or chair or dresser, so our belongings landed up all over the floor or spilling off the one tiny wall-mounted bedstand. There was one tiny 9\"x12\" table with a lamp in the corner, and a wall-mounted flat screen TV. There was also a shortage of horizontal space in the bathroom, nowhere to set my curling iron or makeup or contact lens stuff, and no towel hooks. Part of the towel rack fell apart when I used it. I really have to commend the place though for taking what looked like a previously seedy downtown hotel and making it clean & economical. The shower had a curved shower curtain rod for more room, the towels were bright white, and the beds were comfy. And again, very clean. The didn't advertise it, but there was free Wi-Fi in the room, painless to access and very fast. The air conditioner was noisy so we left it off & it got a little toasty in the room, and there was moderate street noise & sirens on and off. The \"fitness center\" was a small room with an elliptical, a treadmill, and an older stationary bike. There's a restaurant on site that i didn't try but heard was pretty good. It's a convenient 2-block walk to Fremont Street with the larger casinos, and restaurants, bright lights & loud music, shops, street vendors and bizarre street characters. On the way we passed a few homeless people asleep in doorways. There's a big metal security wall around the rooms by the pool, and there are two small parking lots that fill up quickly. If you can't find a space, don't park in the structure as you will pay a fortune in meter fees. The hotel has free valet parking, you just might have to wait a bit for it.

The pictures for the \"Oasis Pool King\" room are inaccurate at best. My room had no table or anywhere whatsoever in the room to set anything. It was so small that it had a king bed (that was comfortable), a chair and a sink. Cell phones were charged on the floor, laptop had to be used on the bed.

The truth is it is a seperate, small hotel from the original property that was merged into the bigger one.

Upon my arrival in Vegas, I placed a phone call to the hotel asking about when I was able to check in. I was told 2 pm. I planned my day to be at the hotel around 2 pm. Once there, I was told I would not be able to check in for another 30-45 minutes. So, I waited and waited and waited, going back about 40 minutes later. Once again, I was told it'd be an additional 30 minutes til I could check in. I waited and waited and waited some more. Finally, about an hour and fifteen minutes after I was originally told I could check in, I was able to finally check in.......... but that my room wasn't ready yet. No problem... is there a place to store my bags? \"Um... how many do you have? We have a little room... \" as she motioned towards a small closet behind the front desk. Being as we had 3+ bags and didn't want my bags just placed in a storage closet, I decided to leave my bags in the car til I could FINALLY go to my room. Upon check-in, there was a dispute with my online reservation from their own website. I was not charged for the 3rd person staying in our room, though my reservation said VERY CLEARLY that I was charged for all 3 people. They insisted on charging me additionally for the 3rd person. Eventually, after about 10 minutes of \"discussion\", she would \"do me a favor\" and adjust the price. Very annoying. If your website confirmation email says I was charged one price for a certain number of guests, why when I get to the hotel is anything different? Why must I beg to be charged what my confirmation says? I don't need favors... I need consistency! The room itself, I suppose, was not horrible, but definitely not something to rush back to. The beds were very blah as were the pillows. At least 2 of the 3 of us woke up with some sort of neck/body pain that we attributed to the bed. Lastly (for the room), the temperature is VERY inconsistent. Keep that in mind if you are sensitive to heat/cold. The restaurant, as well, was very sub-par. When we first arrived, while waiting for check in, we had ordered nachos and the appetizer sampler. HORRIBLE!!! Bland, plastic-y, just all around NOT good. However, we had faith, and ordered a burger and wrap later, both of which were very good... though we seemed to wait forever for them. The staff, as a whole, was not very accomodating. It's obvious they are not thrilled about working there and that you are just another number to them. One gentleman at the restaurant was a semi-bright spot, as was one of the valet attendants. The lady at the front desk, other than the hassle with being charged incorrectly, was decent too. Also, must say, they have very beautiful dealers at the 4 card tables set up in the lobby. This was, perhaps, the best part about the hotel, sadly. Lastly, the hotel is located in what seemed to be a very seedy portion of downtown Vegas. We had no problems, but our walk from the hotel to the Fremont St Experience was slightly scary and I would not recommend doing it alone. Overall, I suppose you get what you pay for. I, for one, will never even think about staying here again. Do yourself a favor and stay either on Fremont Street, or on the actual strip itself.

I left a bicycle locked to my car and the second time we stayed the seat was stolen off of it. I have travelled all over the country for most of the past 6 years and this is where it finally happened. If you do stay here do not leave anything valuable as these guys are so desperate for a drink they may smash your window for a nickel. As for the rooms, they are fine and all feature the same \"Modern\" Art - nice flat-screen television and the wireless internet worked great - the room was better than Binions the last time I was there for sure. The walk to Fremont Street is short and easy but not for anyone uncomfortable around street people. The casino was moslty dead when we were there although once they tried to get people to do Karaoke on a Thursday night. If you are a slot player - there is no paper ticket printout and you must wait for a slot attendant to come around and pay you, this took about 10 minutes so that is another downside. On the upside, all the staff are very friendly and happy to have visitors - the check-in/out was as easy as it gets. The cafe is open 24 hours and looks great for burgers and sandwiches but we didn't try it yet. I didn't see any fitness center but they claim one is going in.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Cucamonga, California", "Title": "\u201cThe best kept secret on Fremont Street\u201d", "Author": "oldguy517", "ReviewID": "UR89374077", "Content": "My wife and I found the Gold Spike by chance and were pleasantly suprised!

They have done a really nice job remodeling their rooms, and the whole property in general. I would have to agree with the person who said Style over Substance though.... and agree with their issues about ice machines, pool, etc. It all appears to be done on the cheap, which is fine by me considering the rates. I was first in an Oasis room on the top floor overlooking the pool. The room was spotlessly clean, and well appointed. The room was a bit small, but not unbearably so. The elevator did not work, so if you have issues with stairs, make sure to be on the bottom floor of this annex. It was a Saturday night, and although busy, there was not enough noise at the pool to prevent me from going to sleep early (8pm) in the evening. I woke early in the morning, and went to take a shower. The handle broke, and I could not shut the water off. I had to call the front desk for help, and they sent up a security guard to shut it off. He was friendly and quickly got it torn apart and shut off, but could not fix it. I then moved to a room in the main tower. I was surprised to find this room even cleaner and nicer than the first room. It was a lot larger, and had a full wall of drawers, desk, etc. The plantation shutters do let light in, so it is impossible to get the room dark at night. This didnt bother me, just thought I would mention it. The beds in both rooms were of good quality, with clean, fresh linens, and large firm pillows. The few issue I had, are as follows: I asked twice for extra pillows, and both times was told that the hotel does not have any extra. The ice buckets do not have liners in them, which I find kind of unsanitary. There were not any towels at the pool for the duration of my stay. I was able to get a couple from a housekeeper, but I think they should have towels readily available...it is a pool after all. Finding parking is a bear, not impossible, but difficult. The restaurant had excellent diner style food at reasonable prices. I would go back to dine there again, even if I was not staying on property. Summary: If you are just looking for a clean, decently located place to lay your head at night, you really cannot go wrong here. The service was friendly, helpful, and quick. If you are looking for a resort experience, or tend to have special needs and wants, go somewhere else. I would not hesitate to stay here again if the price was right.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fountain, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cThe staff was very outgoing,friendly and helpful.\u201d", "Author": "eddie071", "ReviewID": "UR85728829", "Content": "The staff made us feel at home and were extremely friendly.

The GS has been completely renovated but the furniture is not of good quality which includes the beds. I believe the nicest part of the room is the huge flat screen tv with all the channels if you're one to watch tv while in Vegas! When replacing the tub wall tiles, they neglected to add a soap dish which makes it inconvenient while showering. They don't have a safety bar either and I would not recommend staying there if you are elderly or unsteady on your feet. The room was very clean and well maintained. The hallways were very quiet for a nice peaceful sleep. If you want ice, you will need to get from the bar downstairs. I ate at the diner and had their $5.95 prime rib special. Nothing special either but edible and filling. Blackjack tables have limited hours in the evening but the dealers are extremely friendly and minimum bets start at $3. I didn't play any slots as they don't have a players club yet so there's not much to benefit from if there's no club. They say that one is in the works though, we shall see. If you like staying downtown, give the Gold Spike a try. It was well worth the $19 for a Saturday night.

Everything in the room was brand-spanking new - new TV, bright new paint, new furniture. The room was small and basic, but not cramped, fine for sleeping, but you can't host a cocktail party there. Room was clean and housekeeping did a fine job during my stay. The bathroom was small but comfortable, everything worked as expected. The showerhead was low, not a problem for me but could be if you are on the taller side. A tiny problem - I reserved a smoking room, and there was no ashtray in the room. That was the biggest problem I ran into throughout my stay. The pool is also brand new, and open until 10:00!!! The pool area was very well kept. I'll even say it's the second-best pool downtown - which actually isn't saying too much. The casino basically consists of slots - table games only run one shift starting at 5:00. There is no craps(!) and no players club(!). The bar takes up maybe a third of the casino floor, and it's a good one. There is a small sports book window - it is a nice low-key place to place a bet and watch the game. The crowd was mostly locals, but they were a fun and unpretentious bunch. I didn't catch the bartender's name, but she was freindly and efficient. Most places have a casino with a bar in it, the Gold Spike seems more like a bar with a casino attached. I ate breakfast at the small coffee shop. The room was very nice and the service was excellent. I just had a couple of eggs and toast, which was fine but not the best breakfast downtown. The prices were very good though and I would eat there again. The pizza place on the other side of the casino was closed during my visit, I don't know if it's gone for good or not. A note about the neighborhood: the Gold Spike is a short walk to the Fremont St. canopy and the new owners are trying to shake off a bad reputation. The general area is slowly improving, but there are still some homeless people around. The hotel and casino had very good security though, police are present in the neighborhood, and I never felt unsafe in the area. Since the hotel is a bit away from the Fremont St. scene, the area was very quiet after ten PM or so. The Gold Spike is a good place to stay on a budget, with functional rooms and a pretty good pool.

He was impressed with Gold Spike and the upgrades and suggested we all go there for a night of fun on Friday, June 26th. Not only did he okay our large group of 15-20 people but verified it THREE times with management. We showed up in two limos at approximately 9 p.m. Friday night. Mind you, we are a fun group, tip to excess, and laugh our butts off even while losing. One pit boss RITA found our group to be a little too overwhelming. She went as far as to repirimand our tour guide for not giving HER a heads up that we would show up. In addition, she told one gentleman in our group that she would not have her cocktail waitresses \"disrespected\". If tipping them $25 per round and making them laugh their butts off is \"disrespecting\", RITA has more issues than just being a dried up old woman. It seemed to be common knowledge among the other employees that RITA was a liability and ruining what should have been a very profitable night for them. She actually closed the blackjack pit at midnight!!! I thought I was back in Central City, Colorado! In closing let me say ALL other employees were great! Peter (one of the other pitbosses), Jamie (a dealer), and everyone else. I will be writing a letter to the owner/management at the Gold Spike regarding RITA's assinine behaviour.

The price was just right for an overnight stay. I read all the reviews here so I came here knowing that it may not be all that. So it wasn't. But surprisingly, it was pretty good too. So here's my take on it... REGISTRATION/CASINO AREA: There's only one way in and out of this place; through the front door. Registration is in the back past the 4 rows of slot machines. All the broken slots are lined up by registration in front of the security desk which is an actual desk. Yes, there are no more table games either. But the signs outside say that a New Gold Spike is Coming Soon! We got there and there was someone sitting in the back who looked like she was about to fall asleep. I think i may have woken her up not seeing the sign on the counter that says \"Will be back in 15 minutes\". Haha. This is a first for a hotel/casino. But that was fine with us. We just walked back to the bar and got a couple of $1 beers while we watched a basketball game on TV. All the TVs are still CRT. The crowd is filled with locals waiting to go to work drinking beer. They were fun to hang out with while we were waiting for the registration desk to open. About half an hour later we went back and the lady at the front desk was very nice. She can even write upside down which was pretty cool. It was a totally different person than the one who was napping in the back. (NOTE: everyone staying in the hotel has to show their ID. You also have to get a parking pass which is free.) THE ROOM: We got our room for $55. You walk in and it smells like disinfectant but that goes away once you get used to it. The TV has about 4 channels available (no cable) and you have to put a $10 deposit on a remote if you'd like to borrow one. There's no iron/ironing board. There really is no closet. There's a long bar near the door to hang your clothes. There's also an armoire where the TV is. It's just fine for a couple days. The A/C is old and it's just enough to cool your room to room temperature. The beds are comfortable. In the bathroom you'll find conditioning shampoo and soap. That's it. The water pressure for the shower is surprisingly strong. So go down to the casino, win a few bucks and this place is paid for. There are at least 2 security guards at night outside the hotel. I didn't see one scary person outside at all at 2AM when I got back to the room. Overall, it's a pretty good place to stay for a night when you'd rather use your money for other things while you're in LV. The people here are nice too!

I asked again after 20 mins and the unhelpful, unsmiling desk guy said he would give me another room. I eventually went up to it and to be fair for what it cost it was ok. I opened the curtains to see the back of 5 airconditioning units and several filters that had been left on the roof. I kept the curtains closed for the rest of my stay.

After going back down and talking to the 1 person doing registrations they put us in the right room. To apologize for the error they charged me the cheaper rate for the 4 nights that we were there.

The room was fairly large with a balcony, not much of a view though. They were also putting new mattresses in the rooms while we were there. The casino was dirty with a fairly rough looking bunch gambling in there. While my wife didn't like it we had no troubles at all. They also have several security guards around all of the time. We even won a few bucks on their machines. The diner has seen better days but if you are a little adventurous the food can't be beat at their prices. Real plates would be nicer than the paper ones that they use but oh well. The location is only a couple blocks from Fremont Street but with the Lady Luck closed they are fairly dark blocks at night. That being said we made the trip several times on foot with no problems. In fact, we had more people stopping us for change on the strip than downtown. Finally the parking. While the lot is small and behind the hotel they have cameras and security in the lot most of the time. Plus, on the weekends and some nights, they have a guard in the lot making sure that you are gambling or staying at the hotel before they let you park. As a result we always had a parking spot.

I read a review that there were bedbugs, and checked thoroughly for them when we arrived - there were none. If you are looking for a cheap place to crash while venturing out into Las Vegas, the Gold Spike is a great deal. I liked it, and will stay there again when travelling alone or with a female friend. BTW, if you are coming from the right direction, stop at the Nevada Visitor's Bureau in Boulder City on your way in, ask for the coupon that will get you a page of coupons at the Fremont St. kiosk.

At night (our room) got noisy... with the real sounds of the city... ambulances, police cars... so what? you are sleeping in a very BIG CLEAN bed... and have a very nice decent CLEAN bathroom with cool water pressure ;) the ONLY thing I didnt like and maybe if the hotel changed the ROOM CARPET it would look amazing... cause it was rather dirty... yet for that you have sandals! For the smoke smell... which is expected... use some incense or something and its gonna be fine! Didnt like the value meals though but if you have no money they can taste really good!

It looked dirty in the restrauant so I didn't stay and abandoned my gold spike dining experience. I suggest the following tactic if you are planning to stay at the gold spike. a.) bring a friend and make him or her check in and make sure he tips the clerk at least a twenty. b.) once checked in get a good gulp of fresh air (outside if you can find one) and hustle across the dingy smoke infested casino to the old but reliable elevator, c.) if you are lucky you won't have to smell the casio, get to your room and pretend you never had to go through the lower casio, d.) repeat the process to get out and back in.

I guess I will start from the beggining We stayed June 11 and June 12th 2006. What a dump! We didn't read reviews until AFTER our stay (huge mistake) although we did look on their website. After we parked in their lot we were very skeptical. The lot had questionable people lurking about. We checked on our car several times a day to make sure it was still there and undamaged (nothing happened). I was approached but a guy in front of the building asking for money. From that point on my husband insisted on always being with me. We went to check-in, and we didn't have to wait (probably because they had very few customers.) They were friendly at the front desk, and had no problem with check-in or out. It was a good thing that we didn't stay in the room long because they had only 5 channels on the T.V. When we were in the room most of the channels were news. Unlike some guests we did have plenty of hot water, but we had to stand in a couple inches of water while we took showers. However we were not told how to get to our room, nor when check-in or check-out was. The room smelled moldy, and could have used a good cleaning. We seen on their website that they offered a free breakfast, so we figured that that might make up a little for how bad the room and hotel was, so we returned to the front desk to ask about the free meal only to be told that they discontinued the free meal. I told them about reading this on their website and she told me she knew it was on their website, but that there wasn't anything she could do. The next day we decided to try their cafe. I soon understood why they discontinued the free meal because it must have been running off business. We seen 3 employees walking around and eating while they were working. They were not attentive to the customers at all. We ordered hamburgers, fries, and salad. The salad sat on the counter, and we had to ask them for it upon getting our burgers. The salad had flies all around it so it wasn't edible (at least not for me). My husband liked the greasy burger, but I couldn't stomach it. Credit or debit cards are not accepted, but then again they were probably afraid we would stop the payment once we tried to eat their food. And if all this wasn't enough they had a systems check at 7am. Someone got on the intercom to tell everyone that they were conducting a test on their fire alarm. It started blaring, and scared the heck out of us when the loud speaker came on. The sirens and the announcement went continuance for an hour. They kept saying it was only a test, and to ignore it. After an hour they said that concluded their test. About 15 minutes later the siren went off again ths time no one came on to let us know if it was real or not, so we just stayed in our room. The longer we stayed at this dive the madder we became. Other then these listed it was a good hotel (yeah right).

($46 for each of Friday and Saturday, and $29 for Sunday) Hotel rooms in Vegas are extremely inflated on the weekends and I refuse to pay double what I did for the sake of a few hours of sleep and a hot shower. My room was well kept, the floor I stayed on was a non smoking one, the bathroom was adequate, complete with complimentary shampoo, shower gel etc. The carpet had some stains on it, but so has the carpet at the 3 star locations I have stayed at. Let me add too, that I was a single female, traveling alone and at no time did I feel my safety was threatened. Not only did I feel very comfortable at the Gold Spike, but I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. My room was much better at the Gold Spike than the vintage room at the El Cortez that I stayed at last time. (and that room cost me more) The casino downstairs is extremely smoky, as mentioned in previous reviews and the less fortunate locals do seem to favor this one, but again, I never felt threatened.

I couldn't believe how rude some people can be. The next morning my friend called the front desk and asked for some extra towels, again the front desk\" There down here come and get them\" click! At that point all I wanted to do was go somewhere else but ofcoarse no refunds!Now I know not to believe what you see on the web.", "Date": "October 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stamford, CT", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for 35 Bucks\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3986374", "Content": "I stayed in Gold Spike hotel with my family on Sep 23rd for 1 nite.

Though i'd booked this hotel but was li'l concerned about the safety & other aspects after reading couple of nasty reviews. I took a chance a stayed there. The exterior & casino place was really shady and took me almost 45 mins to complete the check in process. But after that the stay was pretty comfortable...I didn't have to go back in the casino so it was ok. Room was clean with two comfortable queen beds. Clean bathroom.

The rooms are surprisingly decent for what the hotel promises from the exterior and public areas - I stayed in a standard room for one trip ($30) which was an equivalent inn style room and a suite for another stay ($40 - weekend) which is really just a big room on the top floor but it does have a balcony with a view towards the freemont street area. A free breakfast is included in the room rate if you ask but the ambience of the hotel doesnt really lend itself to making you want to eat. When all is said and done, this is not the Vegas for those wanting to impress or live it up - it's a cheap room (especially at weekends) and a cheap gamble.

Though others who've reviewed this place have said that there is not soap provided, my friend and I had a fresh bar of soap each day of our four night stay. For $35 on an April Saturday night, the rooms here are a steal. Yes, there is an air conditioner in each room, but I would recommend leaving it on even when you are not in the room, as they are situated low on the wall, and it takes awhile to cool the room. As for the casino... I played here at 4 in the morning just to conserve gambling bankroll after a tough night at the higher limit tables on Frement Street. Yes, the people here are \"one step above street\" (sic); what that means is that they are real people, not the type who look down upon lower class (financially, that is) people. I did not feel threatened here; in fact, the atmosphere was quite loose, and I didn't feel as though anyone was out to impress anyone else. They were here to drink and gamble cheap... nothing wrong with that. Finally, I must say that the smell of the casino is indescribable. It is more than just cigarette smoke; it hits you even before you open the door of the place, and there is no term appropriate for it. The best I can think of is an \"acrid pungence\".

From reading the pure horror in some of the reviews here, apparently some people think the Gold Spike is one step above sleeping under a bridge in a cardboard box, and that it attracts the same kind of clientele. Well, I'm here to tell you that those people are wrong. Having said that, the Spike is definitely not the best choice for everyone. If you're the type of person that has to stay at a Holiday Inn when you travel because Super 8 isn't good enough for you, then you're going to hate the Gold Spike. If lower-middle-class people make you uncomfortable and longing for the security of your Lexus, you're going to hate the Gold Spike. If this is your first trip to Vegas and you're looking for the exciting action of the Strip, you're going to hate the Gold Spike. If, on the other hand, you just want a cheap place, close to the action on Fremont Street where you can crash at night, then the Gold Spike is one of the best values in town. Our room and the hotel part was a touch worn but still clean and very serviceable - imagine a Motel 6 that was renovated some time in the 80s, and you're pretty close. Others have written about the casino being a smoggy den of intrigue, but I didn't find that to be the case at all during any part of our visit. Granted, the weather was nice and the casino doors were wide open most of the time, so that probably helped ventilate it, but still, I didn't find it to be worse than anywhere else. The Spike dates from the old days of primitive casino technology, and so the ceilings are about as high as in your house...if there was a bunch of chain-smokers in there, I imagine the smoke could pile up. The Gold Spike is an ultra-low-roller casino, and so it attracts some low-rolling locals. Like I said, if you're of the Cadillac-and-country-club crowd you'll probably find them scary and intimidating, but having met a fair amount of them at the Spike's blackjack tables I found them to be more benign and friendly than most of the tourists in this town. Likewise the staff - this place isn't exactly the Bellagio, but I still found every employee I encountered to be more than friendly and helpful. I plan to go back to Vegas again in a few months, and the Gold Spike will be high on my list of places to check for cheap rooms.
