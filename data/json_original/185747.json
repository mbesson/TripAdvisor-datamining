The decor was nothing spectacular but I did appreciate that the window opened to let in fresh air. the bathoom was fairly small but updated and adequate for us. This was a birthday gift for my husband so were greeted with a lovely tray of chocolate covered strawberries and hand written birthday greeting. the location is terrific for wandering around the downtown and only a short stroll to old Montreal. we took advantage of the unusually warm weather and strolled the streets all day - the concierge was very helpful in providing directions to several specialty stores for specific shopping needs. we enjoyed the piano bar/lounge off the main lobby for late night drinks - great atmosphere. breakfasts were in the bistro - a large restaurant but broken into smaller areas so it was more initmate. the only ' complaint' we had was the cost of the items on the menu - the cheapest breakfast was about $22.00. the breakfast buffet was $26.00 - there was a good selection of items however the fruit was not particularly ripe and the egg dishes were frequently over cooked from sitting on hot plates. we ordered cappucinos the first morning and were part way through our breakfast before it finally arrived. the rest of the time we opted for the regular coffee which was tasteless. so I would say that the breakfasts were disapointing, especially given the cost. however, the aspect we really noticed the most was how friendly and professional all the staff were.

Nice hotel, very french of course but no problem getting assistance en anglais. Hotel is not what I expected, I thought it would be very grand and imposing , it is upscale but not uncomfortable. Rooms are a decent size, I had a single room with a king size bed. Everything very comfortable and clean, bathrooms are nice but small if you had two people trying to get ready in there. I did not eat there preferring to try the local bars and restaurants, there are some very good ones off and on St Catherines Street. It was a very warm week and downtown was packed with people so if this is the case when you visit , plan to wait in line a few minutes before being seated in a bar or restaurant. Downtown Montreal is very safe for walking so everyone out very late enjoying the nice weather. The Fairmont is central to everything, you can go underground to just about anywhere from the hotel , the Via Rail is just next door under the attached building, so if the weather is not to your taste , just stay inside , eat, shop or just roam around. Overall the stay was great, rooms are quiet, clean , hotel staff very courteous and eager to assist. The only downside to this hotel is the terrible TV, no flat screens here and most of the channels are francais but if it is not your plan to stay inside then its easy to overlook.

It is a lovely older hotel. We arrived in Montreal by train at noon hour. The hotel is above the train station so you don't even have to go outside. Check-in was a breeze. We were able to get into our room right away even though we were really early. The front desk staff & bell-man were so friendly & helpful. As soon as they realized we only spoke english they immediately switched to english. Whenever we met someone from housekeeping in the halls they always said hello. The room is small but comfortable. The bellman felt our room was a little warm so he opened our window & told us to leave it open for a while & then turn the ventilation system to auto. The room cooled down nicely & we were very comfortable. The beds were very comfortable with lovely linens. The hotel has such a convenient location. We had tickets for Michael Jackson Immortal by Cirque du Soliel at the Bell Centre. It was only minutes from the hotel. The next day we shopped till we dropped on St Catherine Street. It was also a short walk from the hotel. You can also reach it by the underground shopping tunnels if the weather is unpleasant. The weather was beautiful so we enjoyed walking outside & discovered all kinds of wonderful shops. On our last morning we enjoyed a lovely buffet breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. The variety of options was excellent. The food was delicious & again the staff were exceptionally friendly. I don't drink coffee or tea & would have been happy with just juice but the waiter suggested hot chocolate & it was so good. I had my own pot full of chocolate. So yummy. Check-out took only seconds & the hotel kept our luggage in a secure room for us until it was time to catch our train home. They even asked if we needed help getting down to the train station with our luggage. We were fine but it was nice of them to ask.

I called the hotel directly for the booking and was able to get a federal government rate at $139 per room for a Fairmont room. Since there were four of us, my husband and I and our two daughters, 12 and 15 we decided to get adjoining rooms, which had two doubles for the kids and a king for my husband and I. This worked really well. I would recommend joining up for the Fairmont President's Club which is free and it provides you with free wi-fi which was great since we were there for three nights and also we asked for an extra fridge in the room which was at no extra cost and we could keep drinks and other food cold. The rooms i believe have been recently updated and the decor is nice but they are quite small but worked well enough given the rooms were adjoining. The biggest complaint from all of us was that the beds were quite hard. We are use to having pillow top mattresses and subsequently had a sore back when waking up. The best part of the hotel is that it is linked to the underground city, which has ample shopping without even going outside. I would suggest not to eat in the hotel as the cost is really high but if you go down the elevator to S2, you walk out through the sliding doors and you are right within the food court, which includes Tims, Second Cup and about 20 other take out places. My daughter loved going down in her slippers in the morning to get bagels and drinks. In the underground is also the Via rail station and also the subway is very close by. We used the pool and workout area, both were very clean and well equipped. The service was definitely rated very high and all staff were very friendly and professional.

We stayed on the 13th floor in a Cathedral view room. If they tell you that you have a Cathedral view room, then you have lucked out totally - it is a great view. The room was well appointed and elegant. The rooms are smaller - but this hotel was constructed in the 1950's - our concept of space was different in those times - so at that time the rooms were probably considered quite large. That being said there is still heaps of room to move around. The bathroom was clean and nice. I really loved the products - Rose 31 - it was the first time I came home from my vacation wishing I still had the hotel shower-gel and soaps. The room did get a little noisy on the saturday night we were there. Outside noise was minimal - we faced a cathedral - not exactly party central - but some people staying in the adjoining room came home quite late and talked a lot - so that woke me up. So should you stay here? Well it is more expensive than some other hotels - but you can get a good deal if you look around. But I think it is worth it. It is old school charm and luxury. It is a great location (right above Bonadventure subway stop and central station) - the airport bus also stops right outside. There is also good parking for all you car addicts out there. You feel good staying in this hotel, staff are respectful and people appear to be more refined there (maybe its the charm of the hotel that brings out the best in people). I would stay here again in a heartbeat - it was a gorgeous hotel - its one of the last true railway hotels - its a grand old lady who has taken very good care of herself - maybe had a bit of work done but its not too obvious and does not detract from her charm.

This might be my favorite city in Canada and it doesn't matter what time of year you go. I've stayed at this hotel 3 times now and have had nothing but the best service and comfortable rest. The linens on the beds are incredible, so much I had a hard time getting up each day. So warm and soft on the skin. Better than many quality hotels I have stayed at. Before I get ahead of myself I need to start from the beginning. Valet parking was awesome for such a large hotel in the middle of a downtown core. They greeted me promptly, arranged all my luggage to be taken to my room and escorted me to check in. Check-in went rather quick considering the amount of guests checking in. If possible when booking this hotel try and get a room at the front of the hotel on a higher floor. Great views of Mont-Royal and the city line. The service at the lobby bar was the best I've ever experienced. Our bar keep Daniel loved his job and it showed. He hooked us up with reservations at the best steak house in the country. Queue de Cheval. If you stay here it is a must. Try the 10oz Kobe Filet and you will think you died and went to steak heaven. They also have a phenomial wine list, cigar bar and the best scotch money can buy. Another must do is a quick visit to Saint Patrick's Bascillia. It two blocks from the hotel. When you walk in to this church you will instantly be humbled and feel an incredible feeling of peace. On a completely often hand if you are looking to party the two best spots are Crescent Street and St Laurent near Sherbrook. Like beer? Brutopia on Crescent street has remarkable craft beer and some of the best live music. The Irish pub \"Hurleys\" next door is great for live music too. Looking to relax? Visit Le Scnandenave spas in old Montreal. They have a hot waterfall that cascades onto your back and neck. Better than an RMT any day. Visiting Mont-Royal in the warmer months is great too. The views are spectacular. Anyway I could write and write. If you are looking for a hotel that is reasonably priced, right smack in the middle iffy all the action and has a little something for everyone, than look no further that the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Montreal.

A few in our group spent an evening at the Fairmont Tremblant to kick off the weekend with some skiing, and then we met up at the Queen Elizabeth for a couple days of carousing. While I have experience with other Fairmonts (Boston, Vancouver, Seattle - see other reviews), I hadn't planned on booking our weekend at the QE until I started calling around for quotes. The Fairmont folks (not direct to hotel, but using int'l number) were by far the most courteous and helpful. I also tried the Marriott and Sheraton in Montreal. The Marriott folks were the least helpful and knew the least about the details of the rooms...even less than I could secure at the property web site for the rooms (multiple, including suites) I was asking about. The Sheraton folks get some kudos - the folks running their call center WERE very helpful. If they didn't have an answer immediately, they put me on hold and went direct to the property to secure one. AND, they did technically offer the best pricing for me. What pushed us to the Queen Elizabeth was the larger sizes for the suites and rooms in general, and the reservation folks gave me the most confidence of room sizes, configurations and proximity when trying to arrange for multiple folks staying together. I won't lengthen this review to cover our onsite experiences. Most were typical of Fairmonts at which I've stayed. Front desk, concierge, etc were ALL very helpful in making various arrangements for us throughout the weekend. The one exception I will mention is our experience at the onsite bistro, Le Montrealais. A bit pretentious, pricey, and service atypical of a Fairmont dining establishment. To be fair, the six of us dining were not dressed as anything approaching business casual, but we weren't dressed as slobs either. We even asked the maitre d' if we were appropriate or if there was another establishment a bit more casual that would be better. I suppose one could argue, \"Well, what's he gonna say....'sorry, you can't eat here', but he seemed genuine and sincere. We entered and were summarily seated in the most remote corner of the restaurant - far away and not even visible to any other guests. We actually didn't think much of this, and almost appreciate it. That is, until no one showed up to serve us. Seriously, after 10 minutes (and 10 might be generous), we had to walk back to the host and find a nice way to ask if we would be served. The maitre d' was shocked and immediately went about finding someone. Alas, the server sent was less than apologetic, and clearly, after what was surely a verbal beating from his manager, was less than enthusiastic about serving us. And the service still was not acceptable. If we could have found the water station, just to get refills on our water, we would've served ourselves, because so much time passed between placing our orders and seeing our server again. A final comment: the chicken club was decent, but the 5 of us who had it didn't think it was a $14.95 sent chicken club.

Even though there was a lot of traffic on the street, we had no issue with any noise from the street or inside the hotel. The beds were very comfortable. This hotel only has valet parking. We usually prefer self parking so for us it was a slight negative. The valet parking is a little harder to find if you had never been there before. The quickest way is to enter via Belmont street in the back of the hotel. The valets are present and efficient. The parking garage is shared with the parking for the nearby shopping malls.

It made it look really cheap. I would stay here if I was able to pay $139 a night (without the help of a corporate rate) but I wouldn't pay any more than this. Also, the rooms are SO DRY.

The decor of of the rooms is very nice, and the room includes a mini-bar, coffee maker and bath robes.

Unfortunately, my first impressions were not positive. When I got to my room, the door was ajar, and not locked. I looked around, and made sure everything was in place, and nothing from the mini-bar was missing, and then settled in for the night. The bathroom was clean, the toilet didn't flush properly, but just required another flush. The shower was OK...not quite Westin standards, but OK. I like the toiletries provided at the Fairmont. In the morning, after a reasonable sleep, I woke up to make some coffee. One of the cups had visible coffe stains on the rim. Yuck. Unfortunately, there were no disposable cups to use, so I washed both cups, quickly drank my coffee, and prepared to head out. I'm not sure if housekeeping changed the cups or washed them, or didn't wash them. When I think about, I've never seen any housekeeping staff at any hotel come with soap/sponges to wash anything. I just assumed they take everything away, and put the dirty cups in a dishwasher. I then decided to test this. I made a small mark (a little dot) on the inside of the two cups with the pen provided in the room. It was fairly faint, and it is easily rubbed off with your finger...let alone with soap and sponges. Well the next night, I went to make another cup of coffee, and I found the two small dots stdill present on the cups. I wasn't pleased, and called the manager. I reached the night manager, and I told him what I did/what I found, and asked him how everything is cleaned. He answered by stating firstly the housekeeping manager was not in, since it was late. Secondly, he had not personally every cleaned a room, and so he didn't know the exact procedure for cleaning cups or the coffee maker (now this got me thinking about the cleanliness of the coffee maker). He did state he knew they don't have soap, but use chemicals to clean everything. The manager sent up new cups, and offered compensation. I didn't expect compensation, and accepted a free breakfast for the following morning. Thank-you. As you will see, I have writted over 70 tripadvisor reviews. I believe I'm pretty fair in my reviews. I'm not surprised by the manager's response, and would make a small suggestion to have a set of disposable cups available for the guests. I would also suggest reviewing how the coffee makers are cleaned, and making sure there is a procedure in place to clean them, even if they look clean already. You never know what the previous guest will do. I ate dinner at the hotel with a customer, and it was excellent. The customer who is a native Montrealer commented on how good the Poutine was (a Quebec meal favourite). Breakfast the next morning was also good. The WiFi worked well, and overall the staff was efficient and helpful. The location is very central to downtown Montreal, and convenient for my business meetings, both offsite for my partners to come to the hotel. The bed were fine, but not quite to Starwood (Westin/Sheraton) standards. For a downtown hotel, the rooms were a good size.

I stayed 5 nights last week at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth for a conference, and am not sure I would stay there again if I had a choice. First, the pros: I stayed in a junior suite, which was nicely and comfortably furnished; not as stylish as the larger suites or Fairmont Gold, but perfectly agreeable. The bed was very comfortable. There's a dedicated President's Club desk, and the staff at check in were very nice and efficient. Indeed this hotel is VERY strong on service, with one exception (see below). The only meal I had in the hotel was room service breakfast, which was excellent and served on time at 6:45am. There's a gym with weights, cardio, pool, and steam room--all well maintained and not at all crowded. Now, the cons: 1. HEATING DIDN'T WORK I was originally checked into room/suite 809, which had poor heating in the bedroom and no heating in the living room. I reported this and a repairman was sent up in a few minutes. He diagnosed the problem and said there weren't any other rooms and that he would have a space heater sent up. Not ideal for $234/night. Waited an hour and still no space heater. So I called the President;'s Club staff, who were very helpful and said immediately that there was another room/suite, which I moved into within an hour (#1617). Alas, both suites has a view of the parking lot, but at least the one higher up had a less offensive view. In the new room, the heating did work properly, but the bathrooms were the old unrenovated style. But the real probem was that the shower didn't work. Again I reported it, and the repair was made promptly., But why should guests have to inform the hotel of these basic faults? Don't they check the rooms before allowing guests to spend a night there? 2. NOISE NOISE NOISE Of the 5 nights I spent in this hotel, I was woken up on 3 of them in the middle of the night by drunk noisy guests ... at 3 and 4 am. And on one occasion security had to be called (by another guest). However, security arrived immediately and the offending guests did quiet down -- and seemed to disappear the next day. I've stated in lots of hotels over the years, and this was the worse experience I had for noise. 3. Erratic chambermaid service. Some evenings I was working in the room and told housekeeping I didn't want a turn doen service ... only for another chambermaid to walk in without knocking saying that she was told I did want the turndown service. On other nights, the turndown service was offered anyway, as I was out of the room. But what a disappointment: a corner of the sheet and duvet was folded back and a bottle of water was placed on the nightstand. What's the point? The last hotel I stayed at the turndown service included dim lighting in the bedroom, soft music on the cd player, some aromatherapy, and a plate of brownies. Now that was service! 4. Poor furnishings. There was not a proper dresser or bureau in the bedroom. The only cabinet was one clearly originally used for a mini bar, coffree service, ettc. No proper drawers for clothes. What on earth is this hotel thinking? All of the furniture was chipped, as were the bathroom sinks, and chipped badly. All in all, a toss up. Great service and a (mostly) pleasant room.

On arrival it became first of all obvious that this Fairmont Hotel has none of the charm that some others like for example the ones in Quebec and Ottawa have. The hotel is an expressionless high-rise building with no architectural highlights. However, the hotel is situated centrally with the major shopping street, shopping centers, restaurant and some sights very close by. The location was much more important for us so that we did not mind the hotel's architecture, although this might have had influenced our overall experience positively. Furthermore, it is not very convenient that it is not possible to stop in front of the hotel during the day. You can only unload the car in front of a side entrance which is hardly visible and even there is only very limited space. Additionally, when we arrived no bell boy or anyone was there to help with the luggage until we looked for someone in the lobby. I think is very unusual for a hotel of this class. The lobby is spacious with many comfortable opportunities to sit down. The front office clerk was very friendly and checked us in quickly and without any problems. We had two rooms on the fourth floor looking at a roof of any adjacent building. This was not very nice but we did not book any special view. The guest rooms as such are extremely small. They are not much wider than the beds standing in the rooms so that there is nearly no space to put the luggage. The bathroom is very small, too and the black floor and tiles make it seem even smaller. But in total the bed and bathrooms are nicely furnished and decorated, the beds are comfortable and you can find all amenities you expect from a hotel within this category. Unfortunately, the cleanliness of the rooms leaves a lot to be desired. The carpet had may stains as well as the curtains. The windows are in a disastrous condition. They were old, dirty, did not close properly and there was mould on the rubber seal. This was probably also the reason why we found thousands of ants in one of our rooms in the luggage on the morning of our departure. The window sill in the rooms is very broad because the AC is stored there. So we put some of our luggage on the window sill as there was no space elsewhere. We mainly packed everything the evening before we left. But the next morning we had to unpack everything again as an ant colony was running all over our belongings. It was awful and we went to the reception to complain. The only good thing that can be said about it is that the front desk clerk was sympathetic and apologized. Besides, she reacted immediately by providing us a free breakfast for the whole family for the inconvenience. As we already often experienced that you complain but nothing happens we appreciated this reaction. Concerning the other services the hotels offers we made one positive and another negative experience. Very positive were our stays in the hotel's bar. The staff there was very friendly and already on the second evening they recognized us and remembered our preferences. Furthermore, you get some unusual variations of nuts, crackers and crisps with your drinks, which are delicious and complement to the drinks and the overall experience. The negative experience we made again with the bell captain service. During our stay we asked the concierge for the best way for five people to get to the airport. We were told that the most convenient and cheapest way would be to go there with a mini van that is spacious enough for five people and luggage. It would be no problem for the bell captain to organize such a car. We should just inform him one hour before we need the car. Thus, we went to the bell captain before we had breakfast on the day of departure and asked him for organizing the car and informed him that we would be five people with luggage because we wanted to make sure that the car is big enough. But when we wanted to leave around one hour later the was firstly now car organized at all. Then a car came but it was ways to small for all of us and our cases. Another a little bit bigger car came, but the bell captain said that this one would be too small, as well and he said that we will need to take two cars. We were quite angry because two cars also meant double costs and it was confirmed that it would be possible to organize a bigger car. In the end we managed to squeeze everything in the little bit bigger car and we were fine. But it was very unpleasant that the bell captain was not helpful at all and even tried to blame us for the problem. All in all we concluded that we faced too many problems during this stay so that we would not return.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLove this Place\u201d", "Author": "aliwithattitude", "ReviewID": "UR120566143", "Content": "If you are planing a trip around Via Rail this is where to stay - The hotel is directly above the station.

(I agree with the other reviewers in that regard, and I'm not even a very large person.) On the other hand, it never occurred to me, though, that not having a flat-screen TV could make a difference. Now that broadcasts are proportioned for \"hi-def,\" I realized as I watched the news one evening before bed that part of the left side of the screen was basically lopped off because of the older set. And while I can tell that the housekeeping staff works hard, I was surprised to find a small glob of what appears to be hardened toothpaste (someone else's) on the lid of the toilet; I left the lid down when I left this morning in the hope that it would be found and cleaned off. (No luck. And the porcelain on the bathtub is a bit chipped--minor, but.....perhaps that glob is an errant splotch of paint, but I'm not eager to find out.)

While I have (mostly) been able to gain access from my room and in the hallways, there is a separate network for the conference rooms--to which one does *not* have access (even if one has secured access to the other, \"regular\" network in the hotel).

The service in the restaurant can be spotty--one night we were seated at a table directly under a light that was faulty and flashing and they knew there was a problem with the light before we were even seated there. We had to ask for another table, very irritating and unnecessary. The room we had wasn't huge but it was very clean and had a great view. The bathroom, however, left a lot to be desired. There was a constant drip from the faucet in the tub, which got increasing worse. Apparently it had been that way for a good while--the enamel around the drain was completely eroded. Of course when we called the desk and a maintenance person arrived, the leak stopped. There is virtually no counter space in the bathroom, except for a small amount above the toilet, and half of that is taken up by the extra toilet paper and Kleenex. There is a bit of space around the sink, but that's not a very good spot if you need to keep your toiletries dry. The lighting in the bathroom is horrible. Many people have already commented on the old television sets. Even my parents have more modern flat screens. I can deal with all of the above issues. Not optimal, but not the worst conditions. The thing that just drove me nuts was being able to hear everything going on in adjacent rooms. AND I DO MEAN EVERYTHING. The staff, for the most part, is friendly and accommodating. Room service was quick. Sign up for the Presidents Club to get free Internet access, otherwise they charge an exorbitant daily fee. Would we stay there again? I'm on the fence.

The cost for the internet was also higher compared to them. Size aside, the beds were comfortable and the noise at a low level. The bathroom was small but adequate.

When I asked the concierge how to get somewhere via the underground city he seemed amazed that I would ask. First of it, it was pouring rain, second we had selected the hotel because of this feature. He informed me in a smug way, telling me it was much easier to do it above ground - did I mention the rain? The line to check in was unreasonable. A bus group was checking-in in front of us and the hotel had one person at reception. Not the front desk staff's fault; they make do. Management clearly not paying attention.

Overall, it was a pleasant stay, mostly because of the friendly hotel staff. The location is right in the middle of the corporate office area of Montreal. Although the hotel is right above the central train station, this is not a particular advantage unless you are using suburban/regional and intercity trains, including Amtrak from the US. There are a several Metro stations nearby, all a short walk via the underground tunnels. The biggest part of the indoor, underground city complex is right around the hotel and train station. You can reach hundreds of shops via the passages, although some are fairly junky. The adjacent Villa Marie complex has nicer shops, and links to the Eaton Centre and similar complexes to the north. You can even walk to the convention hall via the passages, but they are difficult to find and not as convenient to use as walking on the surface if the weather is good. Via surface streets, the old city is about 20-30 minutes walk to the ESE, with some hills to contend with. The entertainment district for the younger crowd, Crescent Street, is about 20 minutes to the WNW. The #747 bus to the airport has a stop right outside the hotel's front door, at the corner of Rene-Levesque and Mansfield. The fare is $8 exact change, but it's better to buy a pass for the same price before boarding, as it gives you 24 hours use of the Metro and buses. The bus worked well for us inbound, but after waiting in the dark for 25 minutes for the scheduled 3:30 a.m. departure, it was a no-show, so I had to scramble to take the $38 cab ride, and wasted my pre-purchased pass. The standard rooms at the hotel are very small, about 14x14 excluding the small bathroom and hallway/closet. On our floor, the standard rooms were the odd-numbered rooms, and overlooked other buildings. The even-numbered rooms were slightly larger and overlooked the main street and the cathedral. We had booked a junior suite, which added a sitting area and powder room in the footprint of two standard rooms, so we had adequate space. The room decor was above average, but not luxurious. The room was very clean except for very dusty curtains, but they were eventually cleaned during our stay. The bathroom was small. It was necessary to close the door to use the toilet. It was clean and well-stocked with quality toiletries, and the shower worked well. There was a mini-bar and an in-room safe. There is normally a $13 daily charge for Internet service -- annoying to me, but it was waived for our junior suite. There is a garage below the hotel, but I don't know the fee. The staff was just delightful -- pleasant and helpful. The good service, combined with the hotel's upscale atmosphere, made our stay a very nice one.

I mentioned that we had checked in over 2 hours ago and expected our luggage to be in our room, instead of being appologetic, sympathetic or anything but defensive he said well how were we supposed to know which luggage is yours, we have numberous bags down here. I explained to him that we provided our room number to valet and he informed us that this information would be passed along to the bellman. I mention the pieces that identify our luggage and the bellman brought our luggage up within 10 mins. We then decided, against the advice of all who have written reviews, to go downstaris to the hotel restaurant and get appetizers and a few drinks. THIS WAS A BIG MISTAKE. The scallop appetizer was COLD and the drinks were not that good, I got a mojito and my husband got a screwdriver....they were not that exotic. I would suggest going to any restaurant in town and you will be more likely to get your moneys worth. Similar to all of the reviews, you can go to any cafe and get breakfast and there are lots of places to go for lunch and dinner. If we are to go back to Montreal, we will not be returning to the Fairmont. I just do not think the hotel was worth the amount of money that it costs.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location, great service!!!\u201d", "Author": "islandhopper72", "ReviewID": "UR103232585", "Content": "Arrived at the Queen Elizabeth on a Wednesday before check in time.

We ended in the newer part of the hotel with updated beds and flat screen TVs and robes. AHHH! Nothing missing here. The coffee Is included in the room, not part of the charged mini bar as one reviewer had stated. GOOD coffee. Yes, the room is smaller than many I have traveled in but this is an older property and we are right in the heart of Montreal! I have stayed in much smaller rooms, you will find I am sure, this room has everything you need. Service from everyone we have met at this hotel has been incredible, helpful, courteous. The elevators are plentiful and are fast. The beds are super comfy and the shower head in our room was just fine (I read some complaints about these). Yes, the bathroom can only fit one person at a time, but I was just grateful to have a bathtub! The rooms for their age have nice furniture and are kept very clean. I get the feeling that staff really do care about doing a nice job. My ONLY real complaint is that the walls are paper thin and if you have partiers next door, you may not get a good night's sleep, earplugs or not! Food in the Hotel is pricey but take a look around, down in the shops below the hotel, so many bakeries!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We ate apps at Planet Deli one night, it was fine, Happy Hour for drinks was on until 8pm, 2 for 1! Cheap meal! I loved walking around shopping underground and avoiding the cold weather outside, leaving jackets behind in our room! I would stay here again. The suites I have been in here as well are sooo nice - if you can afford to treat yourself - do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I stayed in a single king size bed with a view of the cathedral, and I signed up for the President's club membership before making my booking. You should sign up for the president's club because you get some benefits like free internet. The hotel service was excellent. I never had any problems with the staff or service and they always honored my requests for room cleaning and any other issues at the front desk. Check-in was very easy and fast. I had in-room dining for breakfast once and it was absolutely fantastic. I loved the pancake rolls with maple butter. They were great. The location is excellent, primarily because of the distance to the central train station, shopping and food underground, as well as being central to the downtown area. It is a little bit of a trip either via metro or taxi to some of the nicer, more local, French eateries, however, the convenience of this hotel cannot be outmatched. There is an elevator in the hotel that takes you down to the sub-basement level where you can find all kinds of Montreal's best foods, breads, breakfasts, and coffee places. If you do a bit of walking from the central station, you can get to the shopping mall for any clothing or gifts. I had absolutely no problems with the sleep quality in the room, but when I first arrived, the sheets seemed a bit like plastic. I am not sure if this is due to perhaps the room not being used in a while because it seemed to be fine after the first night. The only things that bothered me a little where the lamps, the TV, and the shower-head. The shower-head is one of those really cheap ones you find in very inexpensive business hotels. Perhaps I am a bit spoiled, but I would like to see this updated. In addition, the TV is old and flickers, which is not a big problem for me since I didn't use it much.

The location could not be better for exploring the city. We went down to the train station (directly connected to the hotel, although you do have to change elevators) for breakfast, snacks and some beverages to take back to our room. It was nice being able to walk the Underground malls and shopping without having to go outside. The room was spacious (we had a Junior Suite) and comfortable. We could hear the neighbors well into the evening, which made one night a bit of a pain. Otherwise, pretty quiet. We enjoyed the spa one morning for wonderful pedicures and foot massages. The prices were average and we left feeling refreshed. However the Spa area is cramped, more like a maze of meeting rooms instead of an open, inviting space. The downside of this property was the service. It was passive at best. The President's Club check in was exceptional and friendly, but other than that, it was poor service all the way around. We had to wait 10 minutes for a bellman when we arrived. The valet took our info and walked off to talk to the other 3 guys, just standing around. I had to go over and ask for luggage help. He called, said it would be a few minutes, and walked away. They talked about coworkers and their managers behavior, all while standing right near us. One night of our visit we met some friends down at the Bar for a few drinks after dinner. The service was horrible! It seemed like they were annoyed that we were there. With only our table plus another table, you would think they would trip over themselves to make us happy. Not so. We actually had to get up and go get them in order to have another round. Once again, the 4 waiters stood at the corner of the bar and chatted about their weekend activities while we were waving and trying to get their attention in order to get a menu. Our bill was over $150 for drinks and we were not even thanked for coming in. We ended up going across the street to the Keg Steakhouse and Bar-fantastic food and drinks and wonderful, friendly service. Highly recommend!! All in all, a good stay in a great location. Is it a \"true\" Fairmont? No. Not even close to the service at the Boston Battery Wharf location, or the Lake Louise or Banff hotels. But it's nice, comfortable and a step up from other options.

Just a dull \"swoosh\" that doesn't keep you awake but when you do awake and wonder where you are you can hear it. Try not to use the phones as a 10 minute long distance call to ontario was about $17.00. They also charge for local calls which I think is kind of tacky but I guess like any business they have to make it wherever they can. On a positive note this location is also good if you don't want to go out of the hotel as the 2 stage elevator will take you to the station level where ther are about a dozen restaurants including a Timmy's, Second cup & Cinnabon. There is also a liquor store down there. At the far end of the train station there is a \"depaneur\" ( convenience store) where you can get snacks, beer , wine, magazines, etc. If you want to go out to eat I recommend Wienstein and Gavinos on Crescent, ( about 20 minute walk).

Breakfast prices are as usual ridiculous. $17.00 for a bun or whatever ,a juice and a coffee or $24.50 for what seemed to me when I checked it out,a mediocre looking buffet/trough in the Montrealais bistro.

The Queen Elizabeth was one of the options available to us, so after looking through the reviews, we decided to get it. We weren't disappointed. First, the location couldn't be more convenient. The hotel is connected to Montreal Central Station by means of escalator and elevator, so getting from the train to the hotel was as easy as walking down the hall. Also, the hotel connects to Montreal's vast underground city, of which Central Station is a part, meaning a quick elevator ride takes you to a vast array of shops, cafes, and restaurants, as well as the Montreal subway system. Turning to the hotel itself, when we arrived, we learned that due to a slight mix-up, Amtrak Vacations booked us a queen room instead of a king room. My wife is 6 1/2 months pregnant and a bed that small wasn't an option, so I asked for a king. We were pleased tp learn that for only $50 more a night, we could be upgraded to the concierge level (the \"Gold\" level), which we jumped at. We weren't disappointed. The room was fantastic, with a postcard-perfect view of the skyline and Mary Queen of the World Basilica. Access to the Gold Lounge on the next floor above came with the price of admission, which offered breakfast in the morning, snacks all day, and apertifs and desserts in the evening, not to mention the most comfortable couches I've sat in in a long time overlooking the city. The concierges - both upstairs and down in the main lobby - couldn't have been more helpful. On our first night my wife needed a bandage because she ripped a small hangnail, so I called down to ask if they had one. Not only was someone up within 3 minutes with a bandage, but they also asked if we needed a doctor... no, but I'm glad they asked! Similarly, every staff member we encountered was unfailingly polite and courteous. The room was very comfortable, although the bathroom was a tad cramped, which seems to be a problem with a lot of hotels. Comfort-wise, the bed was great, especially after a long train trip from Delaware, and we had no problems with outside noise. The hotel has a number of restaurants as well as the Beaver Club lounge & bistro. We had a great dinner at the Le Montrealais bistro as well as a room-service dinner on our last night. Surprisingly, the room service menu wasn't too high, although the minibar prices came close to highway robbery (CDN$ 5 for a Toblerone bar? CDN $8.50 for a bottle of Evian water? Yikes!). Little known but interesting fact: John Lennon and Yoko Ono's famous \"Bed-In\", where \"Give Peace a Chance\" was recorded, took place at The Queen Elizabeth in 1969. Turned out we were one floor above where it all happened. Surprisingly, the hotel does not market this fact very much.

There's a TV in each of the bedroom and in the sitting room but they are circa 1986 tube TVs that are tucked inside a cupboard - not good for easy viewing and barely any English stations (I live in Montreal so I know these are available and I'd hazard to guess that most Lennon fans that would stay here are Anglophones).

Note that many places are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbring your own bottle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a result of the high local taxes for licensed restaurants. As for the hotel it does have a personality to it. Some hotels are just hotels, but perhaps during their bed-in John and Yoko left some karma floating around the place. I also recommend the Gold floors. With all the little extras, plus the views from the lounge and your own elevator it does feel like a hotel within the hotel. You can also get some very good deals directly from Fairmont; mine included a $50 a day Food and Beverage credit. The rooms, at least on the Gold Floor are spacious, and pleasant. Not the most modern, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call it classic. For me the Fairmont has three problems; details, some of the staff, and the awful parking. To address each in turn: Details: There was a nice new flat screen TV placed inside the armoire, but no matter how much you turned it was just too large to see from the bed, and one part of the screen would be obscured by the wooden doors. The covered area also included the remote sensor so you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t operate the TV from the bed. I know Quebec is a French speaking area, but the selection of English language stations is on the thin side. One piece of soap? Yes, one piece of soap that I had to move carefully between the sink and the bath. It just lasted the three nights of my stay. The air conditioner was noisy. If you pressed on the cover it would stop for a while, but you would have thought that one of the room attendant might have had someone look at it a long time ago. When I checked in the staff gave me the key to my room on the floor below. There was no offer to escort me to the room. Of course the electronic key didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work so I had to retrace my steps to the front desk. A new key was programmed and I was sent on my way again. This one worked, and there was a follow-up call to make sure that I had managed to get into the room. My suggestion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if the programmed key doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work go with the guest to ensure that they are using it correctly, and to ensure that the reprogrammed key does function. Room Service: Poor and expensive. Presentation was also not a high point (a Club Sandwich seemingly tipped onto a plate with some soggy fries). However it did arrive quickly. The Staff: Some of the staff tries very hard, and some of them don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Staying on the Club Floor I wanted to leave my luggage (I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get an extra 30 minutes extension on the room) with them. Although the luggage could be stored on the Club Floor they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather have it placed in the main luggage room \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always at the desk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Frankly I thought that the point of having the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcClub\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience was to provide that extra level of service. In the Beaver Club (always an experience, sometime positive, sometimes not) I was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcattended\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by a clearly long serving employee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen him before - who really managed to mess some pretty basic things up. To allow me to try the bottle of wine I had ordered he poured a complete glassful (despite my protestations) into a glass that still had the residue of my aperitif in. I did get a discount on the bottle of wine, but it was a terrible waste. For two of the courses I was warned that the plates were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery hot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and they were. One of them would have served duty as a pizza stone. I did ask the Matrie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122D if such a hot plate might not be a bad idea for the rather delicate Black Cod upon it. Perhaps I was thinking that it had been sitting for a long time under those heating lamps? His response was that the kitchen was a long way from the dining room and as a result patrons had complained in the past about the food being cold, hence the too hot to touch plates. He did at least respond to the problems that I raised, but I do think that the restaurant continues to go downhill. Also the excellent lady sommelier is gone. The wine list is still good however, if not cheap and lacking any real choice in half bottles. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to run up a pretty good tab in the Beaver Club as well; the standards could be better. Again the details suffer - the cutlery is also clunky for some of the smaller (sashimi for example) dishes. The restaurant is only open on three nights of the week, which suggests it is not doing very well. The other options in the hotel are very limited in particular at night. The Parking Garage: The Parking Garage (which the hotel staff will say doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong to them) is dark and tight. It does raise a question about why someone doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put some better lighting in. When departing I went to get my car. The valet handed me the key. I asked him if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need the small ticket that he was holding (you place it in the machine at the exit and the barrier raises). His response to me was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYou have something for me perhaps?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 So, if you want your car out of the garage, make sure that you offer a tip first. The garage is expensive as well, and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the hotel well isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that easy to find. On some occasions (not on this trip) you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find the entrance blocked or obscured by delivery vehicles. You also have to wait by your car while they call for one of the baggage staff to come down to the garage to collect your bags. Even if the garage isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t managed by the hotel, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very poor first impression. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d encourage people who can get a good rate on the Gold Floor to give the hotel a try.

I was a first time customer. My sister, who I traveled with, was a repeat customer - and now I see why. First off, the service at this hotel is top notch. The staff are very friendly and courteous. My sister had left her cell phone charger at home and we were very impressed to find that they had complementary phone charges you could borrow during your stay if you were in such a pinch. Also, due to an allergy, we had requested a replacement for the feather pillows that came standard with the room. That replacement came within 15 minutes of our request! They were just as quick to respond to a request to change a broken light bulb by one of the beds. Second, they have great ammenities for members of their President's Club (it's their preferred customer program - it's free to join on-line). These ammenities included free bicycle rentals that can be used by hotel guests to go around the city. President's Club members get free internet access in their rooms (sadly not wireless but ethernet cable provided). Another perk for this club are free calls to 800 and local #s from your room. Free daily newspaper too. Third, the hotel is very clean. Aesthetically, the decor of the hotel is a little dated, but everything seemed to be maintained fairly well. We stayed in a room with two double beds. The room itself was a little bit on the smaller side, but we were definitely comfortable. I am a fussy sleeper and found their beds to be quite comfortable (I appreciate a firm mattress). The room came with a 19 / 21\" television set - but it was an older model - not an LCD TV. More importantly, the TV reception was clear so this was more of another aesthetic issue. Fourth, the Fairmont's location is unbeatable. It's located right above a subway station. The new 747 Airport Express Bus ($7 one way) stops right by the hotel. I also appreciated that they had a food court located underneath the hotel which provided guests with quick, inexpensive meal options. The've got a great bounlangerie (bakery) down there too which I highly recommend. This hotel is within walking distance of Rue St. Catherine which is one of the main go-to locations in Montreal. Fifth, the hotel has a lovely spa - the Gibson - located on its premises. The spa is well maintained, clean and reasonably priced. My sister and I both got massages and were both surprised by the good skill demonstrated by our massage therapists. Sixth, despite being a big hotel, we were surprised that we had no issues with noise levels in our rooms. We didn't hear any of our neighbors from our room. While the hotel does have an indoor pool, my sister and I were disappointed that their pool was rather small.

Within the past year or 2 have stayed in Fairmonts in Toronto and Ottawa and were more than satisfied both times. Didn't quite know what to expect from this hotel in Montreal because it is so large (1700 rooms), right over the central rail station and in the heart of downtown. Although we live relatively close to Montreal (2 1/2 hrs. away) we haven't visited because of stories about traffic, crime (stolen cars, mostly), etc. But, I must say that my fears were totally unfounded. The hotel itself does not seem like a large hotel once inside, the room was well laid out and very comfortable even though we paid a bargain price ($142 CAN) and had a very nice downtown view. Check-in and check-out were smooth and easy and with the free Presidents Club you get free high speed internet. Also free was a very nice health club and pool, spa, steamroom, etc. It's a fairly short, nice walk over to old Montreal and there are plenty of restaurants in the area. We didn't eat in the hotel, but did have a drink at the bar which is very nice, although expensive with someone playing the piano and everyone very friendly. If you don't want to pay top price for breakfast and don't want to walk outside in the cold or poor weather I would suggest going down to the train station where there are plenty of places to get a reasonably priced meal. The underground city (which is huge) is located under the hotel also but doesn't open much of anything before 10am. Plenty of parking is available with quick access to the hotel through the train station. Price is $17 CAN per day and the garage has a secure system where you take your ticket and then pay before you leave, inserting your paid ticket to get out. If you're going to be constantly going in and out it might be worth paying the hotel for valet parking but that's just unlimited in/out for $26 CAN per day. Access to the hotel from outside the city seemed quite easy. We didn't get there on a workday or at rush hour so we don't know what the traffic situation is at those times but was relatively benign on the weekend. We're looking forward to going back in the warm weather because the old section and riverfront area looks like it must be a blast.

It surprises me that there was no free wifi, but that it had to be paid for, whereas the 2* hotel in New York was able to provide it.

In general, we tend to stay in traditionally decorated 4 & 5 star hotels with reputations for quality and convenience (i.e., traditionally decorated & clean hotels that have a bar, a restaurant, and are located within walking distance to local attractions & the historic city centers). Except for the modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor, the Queen Elizabeth fit all of our typical needs and requirements (i.e., it was a clean 4 star hotel with a bar, restaurant, located within the city center, and within walking distance to the local attractions/historic city center). Our overall impression of the hotel, though, was that the Queen Elizabeth was non-descript and average. For us, the hotel did not have the character and charm that normally distinguishes a Fairmont property from any average 4 or 5 star hotel in North American (for example, if we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that we were in the Queen Elizabeth in Montreal we would have thought that we were in any Hyatt, Marriott, or Sheraton high rise hotel). While we enjoyed our stay at the Queen Elizabeth (the room was quiet and the king size bed was very comfortable), our recommendation would be to research other hotel options in Montreal before choosing the Queen Elizabeth. Prior to booking our room at the Queen Elizabeth, we did all of our typical research by reading reviews on TripAdvisor, gathering hotel details from the hotel website, searching the internet for information regarding the hotel, etc. Based upon the results of our research (i.e., mixed reviews of the Queen Elizabeth), we had some concerns about staying in this hotel. After researching rates and comparing our options, we decided to reserve a room at the Queen Elizabeth in one of their \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rooms (located on the 18th and 19th floors of the hotel). In our opinion, if you choose to stay at the Queen Elizabeth try to get a good deal on a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room as these appear to be the best rooms that the hotel has to offer. In addition, as part of our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room package we received several convenient amenities such as complimentary snacks/non-alcoholic drinks during happy hour & a daily complimentary breakfast (a light buffet with coffee/juice). We flew into Montreal from the US so we arrived via the airport (YUL). At the airport, we were presented with several different options to travel to the hotel (i.e., bus, taxi, or town car). We originally chose the taxi but at the last minute switched to the town car option (the taxi and town car options have fixed rates into the city center and the town car was only $10 CAN more than the taxi). I am not sure if this was the best overall choice, but for us it worked out well (our flight arrived late at night and we did not clear customers/immigration until after 11:30 PM - so we wanted to take the most convenient transportation to the hotel). The town car was not fancy, but it was clean, comfortable, and did get us to the hotel by midnight. The town car dropped us off at the side entrance of the hotel (which seems to be typical for this hotel) and we checked in with relative ease (the front desk staff was very pleasant and assigned us room 1961). Just a note - when staying in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room you can check in with the concierge on the 19th floor as long as you arrive prior to 11:00 PM (a very convenient option during peak times). We left Montreal for Quebec City via the train. The location of the Queen Elizabeth (right above the central train station) made the trip to Quebec City even more convenient (simply take the elevator from the hotel lobby down two flights to the train station). The train was perfect. We reserved Business Class tickets (they were only slightly more expensive than the coach option) and we received a complimentary lunch and drinks during the three and a half hour journey (a three course meal with a hot main course and complimentary wine/beer).", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Anywhere and Everywhere", "Title": "\u201cGreat Character Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DAGK", "ReviewID": "UR47110850", "Content": "Good Location.

Queen Elizabeth is the biggest hotel in Montreal (more than 1000 rooms) and has very interesting history behind it. Service level is standardized so that you always have the same experience every time you come. If you can afford it, Gold floor is fantastic... It is not only a slightly upgraded floor as you'll find in other hotels, but it is actually a personalized boutique style hotel within the hotel with your own entrance.

In general, the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth is a really nice hotel but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not perfect. HOTEL AMENITIES AND PUBLIC ROOMS: The Fairmont Queen Elizabeth has a nice lobby with a lounge next to it. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is classy with white marbles floor. I would say that the d\u00c3\u00a9cor is classic and not too modern. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still beautiful in my opinion.

Next to the fitness center, there is an indoor pool with two Jacuzzis. The pool is not really big but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a city hotel, not a resort. So it did the job.

What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s special about this particular hotel in Montreal is that you can access the underground shopping mall by going down a level from the hotel lobby.

And much to my disappointment, the lady at the reception told me to just boil the water from the coffe maker and said that it is the best suggestion that she has. Am I staying in a four-star hotel or somewhere else that is uber primitive? All I can say is that this hotel does NOT deserve a four-star hotel.

They guide you to the proper metro/subway, they explain what the cab fares should be so you are well equipped, they get you to where you want to go in the appropriate/cost savings fashion. Excellent service. We used to pool every night we were at the Queen E, and it was a fantastic way to end a busy day...between the pool, the jacuzzi and work out room, you really cannot go wrong. Very accommodating for any age as there was also a wading pool for very young children. I would recommend the Queen E to anyone planning a stay in Montreal. I would strongly recommend signing up for a President's Club membership before your arrival as you will enjoy free internet access (otherwise $13.95 + tax per 24 hrs) and a morning newspaper every day of your stay.

Their business center is located in the basement in the hotel's own mall right off the lower elevator lobby. The car valet is also located in the basement and is usually charged separately from the room. There is a separate cashier. Taxis are usually available from the front (north) entrance while a small passenger pickup/delivery area is located to the side (west). To get to the hotel's own covered parking garage, you must drive around to the sides and try and find the awkward entrance between the extended hotel building and the Viarail/Amtrak/office building. There will be a few (cheaper) public pay-parking areas here but the hotel's own parking is the north building. The easier way would be to drop off the car at the front entrance. Hotel parking fees are the same for self park and valet parking. Special requests for our puppy was handled efficiently by the friendly Concierge. Lobby Lounge/Afternoon Tea was excellent. Scones and tea were served in fine china at the correct temperature and correct method. The service was slow because there was only one overworked waitress for the entire area who was extremely efficient and polite despite the workload. The breakfast buffet was a full spread, with eggs to order, a large selection of breads, yoghurts, fruits, fresh juices, cold meats and salads. Tea and Coffee was served at the table and refilled. The only complaint is that there was only a tiny plate of a few slices of smoked fish (trout, salmon, stuffed herring) that was half hidden in the garnish and not readily refilled. Overall a very pleasant stay in a classic but dated hotel. I would not hesitate to reccomend this hotel as a reliable, centrally located, extremely pet friendly hotel.

My very only complaint at this hotel was that my older daughter (20) was treated poorly when she took her younger brother to the pool and my husband and I went to the gym-on two different occasions-and by two different staff. She's a younger looking 20 yr old and they were rude..I was surprised at the customer service training and if it happens again I will mention it to staff.

Had a delightful high tea to celebrate our arrival in Montreal (delicious tea and scones). We never had any service to our rooms after that though.

I read below that someone who stayed on the GOld floor had no disruption to their service, but we did not find that, unfortunately. Management were friendly but what can you do if the staff walk out? I am sympathetic to the striking workers too, but my husband is annoyed that even though he asked if anything \"unusual\" was going on at the hotel (like construction, or anything else that could disrupt our stay) when he booked about ten days in advance, he was given no warning. The real problem with booking a family holiday (with young kids) where there is no room service, and the restaurants are closed (which happened about two hours after our check in) and where they don't warn you this is likely, is the jetlagged kids get hungry late at night and there is no food and no safe, comfortable way to feed them. I ended up luckily finding an open place in the train station (below the hotel) at 11 PM. The Fairmont management decided to open one restaurant for breakfast (buffet only) for a limited period in the morning the next day and did not post or bother informing guests in rooms (so we missed it). They did offer a free in-room movie (we got a message on our room phone that we were entitled to a free film), which is not much compensation when there is no service in the room, and the carpets everywhere are getting dirtier and dirtier.

The rooms are fairly small and the bathrooms tiny, but very nicely done and probably as expected for a city hotel. The driver who brought us from Mont Tremblant told us that this was the best hotel in the city for service, but we found one or two aspects a little disappointing. First of all, there was a lovely selection of Fairmont teas in the room but no kettle. We had to ask twice before a kettle was produced and it seemed to take forever. When the staff member brought it, we had realised that our heating was not working, but she tried to fob us off and we had to be very firm until she agreed to look into it! (The room was cold and it was snowing heavily outside.) It appeared that the computer control had been switched off, so there was no problem once that was sorted out. Despite the fact that there were three of us in the room, we only got 2 cups and had to ask for a third, then the maid took it away on our second day so we had to ask again! A minor issue, but irritating. Surely they know who is staying in a room? The public areas in the hotel are beautiful and the staff on reception very helpful. On Sunday when the business centre was closed, the receptionist checked us in for our flight and printed our boarding passes, saving us lots of time. The food in the bar was excellent and the staff really helpful and friendly. The hotel is really well situated and sits on top of the railway station and an excellent shopping mall with a really good food court. We got an excellent breakfast in the station for $20 for three people. The old port is about 20 minutes walk from the hotel and the main shopping street 5 minutes away.

Normally this wouldn't matter, but the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth made me feel like I wasn't worthy of staying in their hotel because of the rate I was paying and where I work. With that said, I'll give a quick recap of my trip. My husband and I took the train in from Toronto on the weekend of December 15, 2005, to celebrate an anniversary. The location of this hotel is absolutely perfect for those travelling by train. Our train arrived around midnight and it was great to just go on upstairs to the lobby. Check-in was a bit slow, but there were quite a few people checking in at the time so that's understandable. We got to our room and we weren't overly impressed or unimpressed. It was just a room. I agree that the bathroom was a little tight but it didn't really bother us much. When we got checked in and got settled, we called room service to see if they were still open and taking orders. They were so we placed an order. After 5+ hours on a train without a decent meal, we were quite hungry! We were told it would be about a 45 minute wait and that they were quite busy. Not a problem, that's how long it takes a pizza to get delievered so we waited. An hour or so goes by and I make a call to see how much longer it'll be. I got snapped at on the phone that they were busy and it would be up soon. After waiting another hour (!!!), we gave up and went to bed, too tired to really care at this point. The next morning, I went to the front desk to complain. Now I must say this, I am not normally a complainer in hotels or restaurants (I can probably count on one hand the amount of times I've \"complained\" about something) but I felt the staff needed to know this oversite. Working in hotels myself, I know I hate it when I get comment cards back from people with all these complaints and not once did they say anything to the front desk in order to get the complaint rectified or compensated. When I mentioned it to the girl at the desk, she brought up my reservation and made a face. She then said, \"Well you work in a hotel. You should know how it is.\" I couldn't believe she'd say that! I would never, ever say that to a guest who was paying an employee rate. Yes, I \"know how it is\". I understand that room service gets busy, but they didn't even bother to come, or call us to let us know when they'd be coming. After talking with her some more, I managed to get a free breakfast for that morning for both me and my husband but I was still not impressed with the way she handled the issue. The rest of our stay was very nice. We loved the location of the hotel. Being that we were there in December, it was very cold and snowy so it was nice to walk around and shop underground. After exploring for a bit, we went back to the hotel to drop off our coats and went shopping without them, which was nice. We didn't eat dinner in the restaurant, as we had dinner at a local friend's house so I can't comment on that. Breakfast was fine. All in all, we had a decent time in Montreal. We would love to go back (preferably in the summer months!) and stay longer (two nights just doesn't cut it when you arrive at 12am the first night and leave at 7am the last day), but would I stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth again? No I wouldn't.

Having said that, I did not drink quite enough to forget what the hotel was like! Luckily, it was quite nice. There was a small error upon check in - I had reserved an extended King room (I think that's what it's called) and there were two reservations under my name in the computer when I got there - one for a normal King and one for an extended Queen on a higher floor. I ended up taking the normal King since there weren't any extended Kings available. The lady who checked me in was extremely attentive. We got up to the room, on the 17th floor, and had a rather nice view. The windows could open a bit, which was nice to check what the weather was like before going out in the morning. As others have mentioned, the TV was a standard, older TV which, while it would have been nice were it plasma or something along those lines, we didn't really spend enough time in the room to use it too much. The bathroom was a bit small, but the space was utilized quite well. My only complaint was that the shower wasn't quite as luxurious as what I'm used to in hotels of this calibre. I was disappointed when I saw that the bed had no fluffy duvet or featherbed or anything of that sort, but the bed itself was actually very, very, VERY comfortable, so no complaints there! The doormen were also great, very willing to give us directions to wherever we were going. The valet was also incredibly fast. We'd call downstairs right before we were to leave, be down there just a couple minutes later, and it would already be there. some of the best valet service I've seen in a hotel. Another advantage was that this hotel is connected underground to Place Ville Marie, which has a large food court that serve plenty of breakfast items. One of our favorites was the deli serving up smoked meat sandwiches. How can you go to Montreal and not have smoked meat? (Unless you don't eat meat... in which case, I suppose you can pass!) One note that Americans should make before traveling to Canada is that you can no longer reclaim the taxes on your hotel. I hadn't realized this and was expecting to get some money back when I left, so now the stay was a little more expensive than I had originally anticipated. Also, one note about Montreal itself, if you like beer at all, be SURE to visit the Dieu du Ciel brewpub. It's just about at the corner of St. Laurent and Laurier, about an $11 cab ride from the hotel.

The Queen definitely was the better of the two downtown Montreal hotels. I arrived early (12pm) for a 3pm check in...they were very nice and accomodating and got me into a room early. We had a great view from our window of the cathedral. The other view from the hotel is Mont Royal, but we didnt have the option since we were checking in early. The room is very nicely designed...but lacking one thing...a flat screen...it amazes me how many upscale hotels are still offering subpar entertainment for their guests. I stayed at a hotel with an lcd tv and it really adds to the room. The entire room (bed,pillows,blanket,desk,et center,lamps,curtains,bathroom) were all top notch, but the tv was stuck in the early 90s. Ok enough about the tv...the bed is comfy...yet small...they said it was a queen size...but I have a queen size bed at home and this was either a full or queen size at the Queen Liz is defined differently in Montreal. The high speed internet is $15 for 24 hours...thats your average price for internet in a room so it was ok. The bathroom is small, but it is very nice with black tiling and very nice wood tones. The toiletries were very nice with shampoo,conditioner,body lotion,shower cap and a shoe shiner (which you will need if you venture into Montreal's slushy dirty streets). I ate at one of their fine restaurants, Le Montr\u00c3\u00a9alais, for lunch one day and had the mexican sandwich, which was extremely good. Reasonable prices too for a very stuffy crod of people eating around us. I got two words for you...creme brulee...I had room service 2 nights in a row because it was so damn good...they arrive promptly (20-25 minutes) and show up with alot of goodies...you get alot for your money, an you will spend money...for my fiance and I we spent roughly $75CAD-$80CAD for each dinner...that includes a tip and taxes. We had the creme brulee and while Im not a desert nut...I have to say it was so good haha. Also try the hen off the menu...pretty good with bbq sauce and great choice of sides. The lobby is very elegant and welcoming...the lobby has an area with a fireplace, comfy couches,seats for reading or people watching and between 2:30pm-6pm daily you can have \"Afternoon tea\". That includes tea in a china set,finger sandwiches, desert etc. We didnt get the tea but it looked nice. Another convenience is that the hotel is connected to the train station...just leave the lobby and take the escalator downstairs and you are in Montreal's major hub...and it connects to dozen of stores,restaurants and passageways to other parts of Montreal's undergound city. We were able to go shopping at the Eaton Centre without bringing our jackets in early March when it was one day -25F. WARNING: DONT VENTURE INTO THE UNDERGOUND CITY BETWEEN 11:30AM-1:30PM WEEKDAYS BECAUSE IT IS VEEEEERY CROWDED AND BUSY! I would definitely stay here again...recommend it when visiting Montreal and you want to splurge. But thats expected when you stay at a Fairmont chain.

I have stayed at other Fairmont chain hotels and this one was no different. The hotel is quite large and plush in a rather old fashioned luxury hotel type of way. When you enter either door, the reception area is not immediately within view, but the doormen and porters quickly direct you to the reception desk.

The special rate I received was $165 for the week night and $185 for the weekend. The room was reasonably spacious with room for a TV and mini bar cabinet, desk, and chair, large armchair and ottoman and space left over to set up a luggage stand. The bathroom was rather tiny. I find most hotels do not give you much shelf or counter space in the bathroom and this was no exception. Nice smelling shampoo, conditioner, bath gel and lotion were provided. They had a hairdryer, but no bathrobe or slippers.The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. You can request turn down service in the evening. My room was away from the elevators, in the middle of a long hallway facing the main street. It proved to be a quiet room.Being there on business meant I did not get much opportunity to explore the hotel. There is a spa, pool and gym which I did not use. I had a late meal in the bistro, Montreal, and a lunch in the Voyageur bar. Both meals were fairly good but not cheap. Soup was $7 and a sandwich $14 at the Voyageur.

Central location and views are unbeatable in Montreal. The lobby bar, adjacent to renowned Beaver Club restaurant, has had a reputation for mixing great drinks for many years.

What's great with this set up is that you can walk underground from the train to the lobby of this hotel without going outside. From the time we left the train to checking into our room could not have been more than 7 or 8 minutes. The hotel is centrally located in downtown Montreal.

Full work out room with small pool and hot tub (couldn't get into the pool, too many people, but the hot tub was great). Some downsides: change rooms for the health club needs a serious upgrade (need to update those antiquated lockers). Steam room not hot enough, no controls to adjust.

There was also full access to beverages from 6am - 11pm. The airport shuttle drops you off right at the front door and the hotel is located on top of the central train station. There is direct access to the underground & metro stations. We had hockey tickets and the Bell Centre was only 4 blocks away. St. Catherine Street, where most of the shopping was located, was a 5 minute walk; Old Montreal was a 15-20 minute walk; Chinatown was a 15 minute walk; the Biodome & Olympic Stadium was a 5 - 10 minute walk in through the underground and a 15 minute direct ride by metro.

The hotel staff is welcoming and professional, and the decor in the meeting rooms was very good--a cut above the usual. But. . . It is nice to be able to sleep in your hotel room. Mine had paper-thin walls. (It was a large queen room on the 20th floor.) The first morning while I was reading the newspaper, I heard very distinctly, apparently next to my ear, \"A Polish Good Morning!\" It was the man in the room next door making a phone call. One hears every syllable of even quiet conversations through the wall. I slept with the radio on (it was pre-tuned to a classical station, set at low-volume--I think the hotel is aware of this wall problem) to drown out all the noise. A more minor gripe: The quality of the linens was not what one would expect in a four star hotel--an old buff blanket, pilled and ragged, was wrapped inside the sheet. Nice features: The bed itself was comfortable. The Fairmont teas are excellent--some are supplied near the coffeemaker and I was able to purchase some in the lobby gift shop, too. The shuttle bus from the airport not only drops off at the hotel door but picks up there without requiring prior reservations. The underground food courts are convenient and affordable, and it was good to have an alternative to the costly food in the hotel. The subway system (underground) is easy to use, clean, and safe, and it is right under the hotel, as is the Central rail station. The distance to the Old Town (several miles)is a bit of a drawback to someone at a QE-based conference--as it is hard to slip out for much more than an hour or two. (The Old Town itself is not as compact as I'd hoped it would be, so it was hard to see much in a short time.) The hotel itself is located in the downtown area, which is not distinctive looking. In the hotel, I had dinner in the Montrealer Bistro, where the service was verrrrry sllllooowww and the food rather costly and fancy (\"bistro\" is a misnomer) but good. Drinks in the bar were expensive but outstanding--great ambiance there. In all, this hotel has some attractive features (particularly the nicely designed public spaces). But when traveling on business, getting one's rest is important, and the room (for 3 of the 4 nights) was as noisy a room as I've ever had in a hotel, for a rather high cost. The elevators were not working at mid-day for two of the conference days (there was also a power outage on my floor one day)--a serious inconvenience when one's room is on the 20th floor.

I was genuinely looking forward to my four night stay at the Queen Elizabeth, and imagined luxurious accomodations and pleasant, courteous staff. How wrong I was. When we arrived in the evening around 8pm by car, no one was there to greet us, help us unload our vehicle or even hold open the door as we struggled to bring our luggage in. The inside was very dated (looked to be trapped in the late 50s/early 60s), the outside is a monolithic block (definitely not the \"historical\" or unique look of other properties) and definitely not up to the standards of their other properties. When we got to the room, not only did it resemble the interior decoration of a Super 8 motel, we also discovered that they had given us two double beds and not the single queen that I had confirmed during my reservation. When I went downstairs to see what had happened, the agent tried to blame the error on me and said that I \"probably forgot to request it\" -- not even an apology. But these were mere trivialities to what was to come. Our first morning the electricity was out. Instead of being polite about it, the staff felt compelled to blast this information at 7:30am over their loudspeaker/intercom (again no apologies). If you were asleep, you wouldn't be after that! Not to mention that you couldn't even get ready for the day since you couldn't see a thing -- and we had to walk down sixteen flights of stairs to get outside. On our third day, the cleaning staff went on strike. Not that we knew about it until we came back from a long day to find that our room was still not cleaned and wondered why. I called downstairs to see what was going on, and was forced to sit on hold for over ten minutes. When I inquired why our room had not been cleaned, the woman snapped, \"I know it has not been cleaned\" and with further pressing, said that the cleaning staff was on strike and there was nothing they could do except maybe \"send some clean towels up.\" When I suggested that maybe they could proactively give their guest a heads up, she claimed that they did not know about it in advance. (Funny, I thought the crux of most strikes rest on the fact that they make it known that they will be going on strike unless certain conditions or demands are met). The concierge continuously had long lines, and their information/knowledge was very poor -- when we asked for dining recommendations at 8:30pm, they seemed baffled by thinking up such \"late night\" dining options. They were stumped by other fairly easy questions as well. We also did not receive our newspaper the first morning, and the remainder of days we did not receive the newspaper we had requested. Normally I would overlook trivialities like that, but everything else was such a terrible experience that this was a cherry on top. I consider myself well-travelled and have stayed at many kinds of hotels in many countries, but this ranks in the Top 5 Worst Experiences. I will not be staying at this, or any other Fairmont property in the future. p.s. The location of the Queen Elizabeth is not nearly as great as it seems. You have to wind through a number of bizarre tunnels and staircases to get to the train station/Metro that it sits on top of. The Marriott and Sheraton nearby are much more accessible. Also the valet service is very awkward. You have to take an elevator to the main floor, transfer, then either take the stairs/escalator or another elevator to reach it.
