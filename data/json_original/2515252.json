First, it is located just a brief walk from the Champs-Elysees. Second, the staff was phenomenal. Each staff person we encountered was very courteous and helpful. The hotel features an extensive and impressive breakfast buffet common in many European hotels as well as a cozy little bar that's a great stopping off place before venturing out for the evening. In the weeks before our trip, I exchanged emails with the staff with various questions that my group had, all of which were answered promptly and courteously.

We loved it. It was odd to note that many Parisians were gone on their own vacations and had locked up their businesses in the area. But there were plenty of tourists so the city did not feel deserted. The hotel itself is in a fabulous location. We walked everywhere. It was clean and tasteful. The walls were covered in fabric. So charming. We rented two rooms. Our bed was comfortable. We had no view - we were on the interior of the hotel. But there was nice sunlight coming in and it was fine. Our children had a view of the city street and the restaurant. They enjoyed that. We had a nice bathroom, but the 2nd bathroom had an odd little half wall instead of a shower curtain. It didn't keep the water inside the tub, so that was a bit of an inconvenience. (Water everywhere) As others have commented, the breakfast was plentiful and delicious. We even took fruit with us for the day and enjoyed having a snack for later. That was helpful in Paris, because it was extremely expensive to eat in this area of the city. I called it a \"viewing fee\". If you could view the Eiffel Tower - you paid a premium price for everything to eat or drink. So anything withing walking distance was very pricey. In neighborhoods farther away - dining and drinking were more reasonable. - but then there was the taxi fare. Oh well - just know before you go. My techno savvy son was not too impressed with the internet connection available in the \"business center\". It was an extremely small phone booth in the basement area. That wasn't great, but maybe it limited his screen time, which is a good thing. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff was helpful.

The starter was OK but the main course was very poor just a peice of lamb with mashed potatoes and with two drinks it cost 86.00 euros! OK we expected to pay big money in Paris but also expected good food we would have happily paid more if it had been excellent. I thought the French could cook!

We have been to Paris numerous times and try to stay in a different area each time we visit. We were there in August which is an interesting time to be in Paris: few Parisians, many tourists, many restaurant closings but easier to get in to those places that are open, a lot calmer than other times of the year. The hotel location was wonderful, away from the major tourist areas like Marais. Latin Quarter and St. Germain but still in walking distance to Eiffel Tower, Les Invalides, Musee Branly, Champs Elysees, Avenue Montaigne, the Seine. Also near Metro and Batobus stops. Very much a neighborhood rather than a tourist hub. Nice to return to at the end of a busy touring day. Our room was pretty large by Parisian standards, with a comfortable sleeping area and a separate dressing area. The bath was smallish but very adequate. Very clean, nicely decorated, comfortable beds, and very quiet even though the hotel was full and we had babies next door. Staff was friendly, spoke English, and most pleasant. Only complaint was that the lobby bar was not open which may have been due to the time of year. Not a problem since there were cafes and restaurants within walking distance.

D.alsace was on a corner of the Champs Elysee and did a fixed price menu, the food was quite good here but pricey for some I had the rib eye steak (35 euros) and the english menu was more expensive than the french one, ask for both for the translation but the french one for the price, but our best meal was at Bileboude on rue exposition (check on internet correct details) 33 euro for 3 courses, good quality but more nouvelle cuisine sized portions. (this was across bridge from grand palace towards eiffel tower and along 4 streets) but prebook closed on sundays. Icecream across bridge from notre dame is very good Berthillion (looks like normal icecream but had the hazlenut one it was creamy and delicious) La douree bakery on champs elysee is over rated, very posh tea room but just okay.

We enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which was included in our rate. They serve scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, a type of ratatouille for on your eggs. Also, several cheeses, cold cuts, spreads, breads, croissants, rolls, crackers. Orange and pink grapefruit juice, canned fruit, fresh fruit, dried fruit, nuts, granola, cereals, milk, yoghurt, some sort of creamy yoghurt/cheese mixture (it was good). You order coffee or tea when you sit down. We had such nice breakfasts that we rarely ate more than a croissant or crepe for lunch. They do not offer dinner at the hotel and we did not visit the bar. The in-room food is quite expensive. E6 - 8 generally. A better option is to visit the little wine shop next door. They sell a large bottle of water for E1.80. There is also a small Supermarket around the corner (left out front door and first street to the right. down a block). Very convenient. The staff were very courteous and helpful, giving us directions a few times to diff places (to the RER to Versailles etc). Overall, it was a good choice. The large rooms, breakfast included, convenient Metro station, helpful staff, quiet location...Perhaps if you are wanting a hot and happening place you will choose a hotel directly on the Champs Elysees, but good luck getting the items listed above.", "Date": "June 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - will definitely stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "Playmates", "ReviewID": "UR57957291", "Content": "My husband and I just spent a romantic 4 day weekend at this hotel.

There is a decent cupboard with a small safe. The rooms have flat screen TV with 5-6 french channels and English language news channels. However, the room does not have an ironing board, nor does it have any complimentary mineral water or tea/coffee maker. We paid 10 Euros for a pot of tea and some packed cakes served in our room. The ensuite bathroom was somewhat old-fashioned but it is clean. The baths are largesized and it is equipped with a hand shower. The hotel provides toiletries of reasonable quality, bath robe and hair-dryer. We got Room 34 during our second 6 night stay. This room was almost the same as the previous one, but it looked out onto the street. We had breakfast included in our package. It is good, but it is exactly the same every day. The breakfast includes tea/coffee, cakes/pastries, different kinds of breads (including excellent croissants), fresh fruit, yoghurts, cereals, dried fruits, orange/grapefruit/tomato juice, cheeses, smoked salmon, bacon, sausages, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, 3-4 types of cold-cuts. Breakfast is open from 6:30 am to 10:30 am everyday. The hotel's USP is its location. It is just a 5 minute walk from Champs Elysees and from the Franklin Roosevelt Metro Station.

The Amla Marceau Metro Station is right there and if you cross the bridge you will reach the Pont De'Alma RER station from where you can catch a train to Versailles (it takes about 30 minutes). Avenue Montaine, which houses all the top designer outlets is less than 5 minutes away from the hotel If you visit google earth and locate the hotel you will see how close it is to Eiffel Tower, Musee D'Orsay, Place de la Concorde, Arche de Triumphe. You can easily walk to the Louvre and even to Notre Dame if you are feeling energetic. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. They answered each of our queries very patiently -- helping us with directions, searching the net to take out information that we needed. All in all, we had a very pleasant experience.

It also has cereals and fruits. The price was Euro 23, which is really overpriced, if I didn't have this included in our package, even if you pay me Euro 23, I would not have breakfast at this hotel because it was not worth the price for this meal. The airconditioning unit was never on the week we were there from 25 April to 2 May 2008. Thank goodness the weather was cool enough during that time in Paris not to have the airconditioning on. I suppose they were saving energy at the expense of the patrons. Also be very wary and extra cautious in leaving your money in their safe. We make it a point to lock the combination safe everyday but when we checked our cash supply the following morning, we were missing 5 US$100 bills. This is despite the fact that we were 100% sure the safe was locked when we left in the morning for our sight seeing around Paris. However, the smaller US$ denominations of a couple of 20s, 10s, 5s and a few 1 dollar bills though were surprisingly not taken. The only explanation is the hotel has the capability of bypassing our combination lock and opening the safe, which we think is what happened. The lesson here is check your money in the safe in the morning before you go out to do your touristy things and check it again when you return at the end of the day. Despite this, we tried not to get too upset about it and enjoyed our visit to Paris. If asked if I would stay in this hotel again? I would respond by saying I probably would but if its the summer, I'll ask them if the airconditioning is working, otherwise, if it's the colder months, then it's not a big deal if the unit is off.

The hotel room was sizeable for Paris, the air conditioning was excellent with an in-room control, the beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was modern and spacious. The staff was accomodating, and, as most flights arrive from the US in the early AM, we were graciously given coffee while the staff prepared our room for an early check-in. There is a great gourment bakery/meat shop just two doors down, an excellent restaurant right across the street, and the location for sightseeing is superb. The staff speaks English, and I would recommend without hesitation this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Paris near the Champs.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Green Bay, WI", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "GreenBay_WITraveler2", "ReviewID": "UR8120995", "Content": "We found this hotel to be in great location with easy access to the Metro.

Area is less busy than the Latin Quarter but we found it entertaining. There were several good cafes on the block where we ate.
