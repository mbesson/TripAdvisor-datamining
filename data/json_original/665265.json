{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Awesome Studios with kitchenette I stayed in a studio with a kitchenette at the Waikiki Sand Villa and I loved it (April 2007). It was very cute and cozy and for $160 per night, I thought it was a deal. There is a small pool and clean bar/restaurant area in the lobby. The free breakfast in the morning was mini-doughnuts, toast, coffee, OJ and mini-croissants (something to hold you over until lunch). The hotel is about 2 to 3 blocks from the beach so that was the only thing I didn't like but it was across the street from a grocery store which was very, very convenient! The service was okay; I liked the free Internet access in the computer room (2nd) floor. The computers are new and there were about 10 computers so I never had to wait. I would recommend staying at one of the studios; definitely better than the regular rooms.", "Date": "May 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR185051447", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "JengJeng"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d665265-r7594976-The_Pualeilani_Studios_at_the_Waikiki_Sand_Villa_Hotel-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html", "HotelID": "665265", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
