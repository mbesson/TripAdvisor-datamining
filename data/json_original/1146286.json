The GOOD: Excellent location within walking distance of Leidseplein. Bus/Tram stop at ~ 100 m. Clean (albeit very small) room. Comfortable (albeit small) bed. Safe large enough for laptop. Complimentary WiFi in room. The BAD: Room is very dimly lit, difficult to see anything at night. No hair dryer in room (can be borrowed from front desk). Long waits for elevator. Mediocre buffet breakfast, not worth 15 euros (or even discounted rate of 9.50). Bathroom with poorly designed sloping floor, gets flooded at every shower. The UGLY: Payment is required at time of check-in. The receptionist (Nataniela) applied dynamic currency conversion without my consent and charged my card in USD instead of euros, which resulted in a higher charge. When I objected, she claimed that they were required to do it that way and she couldn't charge me in euros (sic). Only after I took strong exception and threatened to dispute the charge, she \"found a way\" to charge me in euros. Phone in room didn't work. Had to complain x 2 and was told they would activate it. After waiting several hours, had to repack and change rooms. Receptionist frequently away from front desk for 15-20 min at a time, resulting in long waits (key card no longer working after 1st day resulted in 30 min wasted). I asked to speak with the manager but was told none was available.

It is on the highly regarded shopping street of PC Hoofstraadt (think I have spelt that right) and really close to some of the key museums in Amsterdam. We had the last available room, and were on the top floor in the eaves. While the view was great the room was a little small. That said, it was plenty big enough for us. Beds are comfortable, bathroom very new and the room was perfectly clean and prepared. The management and staff could not be more helpful, and are seemingly on hand at any time at all! The breakfast is basic and continental style, but presented very well with an ever present waiter there to help if needed. They do some wicked scrambled eggs!! A couple of points to note; if you find stairs a problem then getting to breakfast might be an issue,as the lift doesn't go down to the basement, the stairs down there are very steep! The other point is that the sound proofing in the room we stayed in, could have been better. It is certainly not as bad as other hotels I have stayed in, but it was a little annoying at times!

But lets also not forget about the window that when closed lets the rain sweep across the window ledge ..so bad we put a towel on it to stop it going on the floor ..and reported to cleaner who gave us a smile and said 'yes we have known about it for Months' This Hotel is based on our experience a rip off ..we have stopped in far superior hotels in Amsterdam ( at least 7 times before).

As a result walking to and from the hotel at night felt fine. No awkward back alleys or dark streets - great for single travellers, women and famines in that respect. After reading previous reviews I was a bit worried about the Robert Ramon, however personal experience proved it was an excellent choice. The rooms are a good size for Amsterdam, immaculate with a small bathroom (but more than adepuate) and a small TV. But I wasn't staying for the bathroom or Tv so no complaints. The twin beds were comfortable and the free wifi was great. Didn't have brekfast as there was a lovely bagel place 5mins walk away. So can't comment on that. Staff at check-in ad check-out as well as during my stay were always kind and curteous. The only issue is noise on the street outside on a Saturday night. The windows don't keep out the sound and in the warm summer you want them open. The hotel did have earplugs which helped but if a silent hotel on a Saturday is a must I wouldn't recommend this place. Midweek and Friday were fine. I guess is he flip side to the great location.

I went to Amsterdam with 2 friends. We reserved a triple room for 180 euros a night. The first thing that struck me was the sign outside the hotel with the official 3 star rating. The website clearly says it is a 4 star hotel. The lobby was very bland and plain. The elevator was not working. The room was the real kicker though. Their idea of a triple room is a single with 3 small beds. The third bed awkwardly placed without even a lamp on the bedside. The flat screen tv mentioned on the website is in fact a very small and cheap tv (Im including a picture). There were no cupboards or dressers to fit the clothes of 3 people. I complained to the receptionist and wanted to cancel my stay. Conveniently, the Robert Ramon charges for your full stay as soon as you check in. No wonder... they probably have to deal with a lot of clients who want their money back. I was told that I would not be able to get a refund for the first day as there is a 48 hour cancellation policy. I asked for a better rate for the second night and was told that when I booked I knew what the rooms looked like from the website. The rooms look nothing like in the website, never mind the false advertisement claiming it is a 4 star hotel.

It looked nice and the price was right so I booked this hotel via our travel agent who took our credit card to hold the room and provided us with a confirmation number and paperwork showing we had a triple room booked for 2 nights. We assumed we were good to go. (YES, I should have booked it with Trip Advisor!) Upon arrival at Robert Ramon (after a 45 minute subway ride in Brussels and a 2 hour train ride to Amsterdam followed by navigating Amsterdam with a 10 year old and three suitcases), we were to say the least, tired and stressed but ready to check in. Alas, the Robert Ramon claimed they didn't have our reservation and no rooms available for two nights. After a futile attempt by our travel agent to correct the situation, they only offered us the ability to find another hotel in Amsterdam. From what we could observe with the staff, they were new, timid and lacked confidence (and apparently the ability to help us), so they asked the manager to come up from the basement. The manager was abrupt but polite and told us there was nothing she could do and mocked our travel agent for making this error - not taking any responsibility what-so-ever. I immediately called our agent on my cell phone and she agreed to talk to them, but still wouldn't budge. She called one hotel, booked it and gave us directions how to get there, so for that we can thank her. Little did we know it was on the edge of the Red Light District - however it was much less expensive than Robert Ramon, the staff there was VERY helpful and the rooms were clean. The hotel was similar to what we saw here on Trip Advisor. I was surprised at the sparce, TINY lobby. We had to be buzzed into the lobby by the front desk staff so I'm assuming they've either had issues with transients or they prefer the security. Neutral mono-chromatic decor, looked very modern. The hotel appeared to still be doing some renovations as well.
