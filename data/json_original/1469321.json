The staff, from the doorman to the checkout agent, are patient and very oriented to providing exceptional service and making a positive impression. Eager to please, professional and efficient, they create an oasis of true service in an industry that often fails to meet expectations. On arrival, the doorman was quick to open the cab door and welcome us to the hotel. He took charge of removing our belongings from the trunk and had sufficient time to even open my door before I could complete payment of the cab fare. He waited patiently until I was ready to exit the cab and, noting that we had limited luggage, offered assistance with the bags instead of assuming complete control of them. Next, my check-in went quickly and flawlessly. The agent met me with a welcoming smile as I approached her and appeared to be genuinely pleased that she could settle me into the hotel and answer any questions I might have. I asked how I might arrange a wake-up call and she quickly took it upon herself to ensure that I need not do anything else. Many other 4 star hotels often provide you with procedures to obtain a wake-up call from your room instead. The lobby is well-maintained, spacious, and tastefully decorated in warm tones. The elevators are roomy and very efficient. Before you even realise it, the door opens and you're on your floor. My room was a corner room on the 12th? floor. There was more than enough room (for two) to get comfortable in. Nothing was out of place in the room and there was no evidence that someone had previously stayed here. It was pristine and the air was fresh. The room also had all of the amenities that a traveller might need; and some that are not always found in 4-star accomodation. I chose one of the double beds in the room for the night and found it just a tad firm to my liking. It didn't occur to me to play Goldilocks and try the other bed. I wouldn't be surprised if the other was less firm, though I'm speculating based on overall impressions. My colleague called me from her room to meet her as we'd decided to have dinner at Prestons, the hotel's restaurant. On arrival at Prestons, more smiling, friendly faces to greet you and settle you into your table without delay. Prestons looks to be an upscale restaurant. Though well lit, the ambience is welcoming and likely more suitable to a business dinner than a quiet/romantic dinner. That said, I would have no hesitation to celebrate a romantic dinner with my wife. The restaurant is large enough that there are likely quiet corners available. The service was professional, yet warm. Alisha (forgive the spelling if its wrong) eased my normal reservations about any unfamiliar restaurant immediately. She devoted herself to helping me though my selections of unfamiliar ales and wines, appetizers, mains, and desserts. There was a lot of choice in both appetizers and mains, and ultimately, though regretfully, I could only manage one of each. I was already cursing my next day early evening departure which would deny me the opportunity to sample other delights on the menu. Alisha continued to appear throughout the evening at opportune times, to ensure that the evening would be memorable for not only the quality of the food, but the generosity of her service. The next morning, I opted for the buffet breakfast instead of the, a la carte. There was ample choice of freshly-prepared American breakfast items (the stick to you stomach fare) and the normal continental items such as croissants, breads, cereals and yogurts. I sampled a little of most items including one smallish almond croissant which was the highlight of breakfast. It was reminiscent of some of the better croissants I've tasted in France. I'm hopeful that I won't be waiting another 33 years until my next visit to Vancouver as I'd like to revisit this establishment. I heartily recommend this hotel and its restaurant.

I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. It's a newer property and well appointed, including big bathrooms and a very comfortable mattress. It's close to the convention center and to shopping. Lots of interesting eateries around. But the people are what make this a top-notch place to be.

Sure, they are supposed to be all those things, but this group just takes it up a notch. There was a mixup in the type of room I needed.

Well, unfortunately downtown Vancouver has gotten extremely noisy due to a population that has more than doubled since the 1980s and the sounds of sea planes and sirens reverberating off of all the glass towers, including hotel rooms with their enormous glass windows allowing all the noise to permeate through them. Unfortunately, the same phenomenon holds true for any glass tower hotel in the downtown, including the Marriott and the Delta. So if you're sensitive to street noise like me, even earplugs won't even suffice. The noisy ventilation system did not help things either.

We were fortunately billeted at a corner room w/ good views of the harbor and the staff was most hospitable and helpful in more ways than one! Wanted to give special mention to Mr. Romy Herrera, the hotel comptroller who was quite welcoming and accomodating! Gave us a good insight on Vancouver and the highlights to see as seen by a local. Also, the people at the Front Desk and 2 concierge personnel named Ken, (i think) who was doing our valet parking for us. Always ready to give us personalized suggestions as how we made the most of our 3 day-2 night stay in the city. Amazing how in that span of time, we were able to do a quick bike ride along Stanley Park Seawall, have a quick visit to the beaches, go to Capilano Suspension Bridge, Kitsilano Beach and the Granville Islands and sample the best seafood a harbour city like Vancouver can offer. The hotel restaurant/bar was likewise an outlet to try. The food was exemplary and quite decently priced, with impressive service staff. If one is travelling on business, one can easily unwind in the very clean and well maintained gym, hot tub and pool. All in all, a great hotel to stay in. So, if you are looking for a hotel with the luxury feel to it, w/ personalized service and yet have that homey feel which a family can likewise enjoy, be it on business or pleasure, this is the hotel we totally suggest you look into!

WE therefore used both beds so that we had access to the light and beside cabinet. (There should be a cabinet and individual on both sides of each bed so that they can be used as doubles). This turned out to be typical of Canadian hotel rooms on this tour. There was also only one suitcase stand - not ideal for 2 guests living out of 2 suitcases. There was the usual hair dryer, ironing board and tea/coffee supplies (limited milk and sugar). The window overlooked office blocks at the back - no problem as we ere not there for the view!

I didn't mind since we got a great deal but if you're paying full price you might want to consider another property. The hotel is less than a year old so everything is new but the room was on level with a Holiday Inn in terms of comfort and polish. The beds really were tiny and we ended up taking one each which wasn't so nice. A word of advice, there is actually a small amount of free street parking available within a block of this hotel. We were lucky enough to snag a spot (in front of the townhouses one block closer to the water) which saved a lot of money. Parking is also free at the metered spots form 10:00pm to 9:00am so if you plan on being out during the day you might want to consider this as an option as well.

Also 10min walk from Cruise Ship terminal at Canada Place. These walks are on a scenic promenade along the waterfront. Avoid driving there if poss.-Parking is expensive - almost $40 incl.tax daily, 3.Hotel - fairly new, fast elevators, eco friendly - refillable soap dispensers etc in bathroom, bins for recycling in room etc. We stayed in lovely Superior rm - spacious corner rm, floor to ceiling glass windows,king bed, 2 comfy chairs with ottomans, wall mounted TV, coffee maker, iron, ironing board, bathrobes. Lots of views out those windows! And everything spotless! Pool and spa are off gym - small, nowhere to sit around pool area- only for swimming, not sunbathing. 4. Food - Restaurant in Hotel- Prestons- good but expensive. Lots of restaurants within walking distance- along waterfront, up on Robson street. We ate at White Spot- 10min walk.. 5. What to do nearby - Stanley Park ( if adventurous can walk waterfront promenade which links up with Stanley Park seawall for hours of scenic walking/running) Promenade-sit on a bench and watch continuous harbour activity-cruise ships bound for Alaska, float planes, commuter seabus, private yachts etc. Water splash Park for young children - 1 block", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, MA", "Title": "\u201cNew property, large spacious room, great view but not luxurious\u201d", "Author": "mlsLincoln_MA", "ReviewID": "UR74121996", "Content": "the hotel , location and staff are all very good. the lobby is a little sparse.

My husband arrived from the airport using the Canada line and i drove in on Hwy 1/ Hastings Street. Neither of us had any difficulties. The staff looking after the cars/valet parking are all delightfully helpful and super efficient. Their local roads and traffic knowledged was spot on...While at the hotel we ventured off in many directions and each time was given extra tips by the lads taking care of the vehicles. We stayed at the hotel on two occassions...pre and post cruise. We experienced both the comfort room and the superior room. Both room types are well appointed with plenty of room space. Great bathrooms with everything we needed available. The hotel rooms were both very quiet. We didnt ever hear any other outside noises. We enjoyed our breakfast at the hotel's restaurant.....but didnt have every breakfast there as the hotel is situated in an area where there are many eateries and interesting cafes to explore.

Granted it is still a brand new hotel and chances are, the rates will go up, but for now, it's become my hotel of choice in the city. I'm fairly loyal to Hilton brands, but unfortunately, the only downtown option in Vancouver is the Hampton Inn which half the time, is sold out or just poor value for money and its location is less desirable than the Coast Coal Harbour, if not attending a show in town. That said, this hotel is good enough that you could put a Hilton sign on the door tomorrow morning without changing anything and no one would notice it used to be a Coast Hotel. That's how nice it is. PROS include: -Extremely nice staff, minus one exception on my second stay in June which I brushed off. That particular staff member should not be in the service business. -The food at Preston's is excellent, I had breakfast one morning, lunch another day and I liked it so much, I ordered room service on my following stay. Room service is remarkably reasonably priced. -CLEAN rooms with beds fit for any princess. Like sleeping on a cloud. I just wished 1)they had feather pillows instead of foam, 2) Had more than 2 pillows on a double bed. Most hotels will give you 3 or 4 these days but that's a very minor detail. -Nice pool area with a HOT hot tub, which is always a plus over some lukewarm hotel hot tubs I've seen. Didn't use the gym here but it is equipped well enough for any workout routine. Note to management: first time I've seen a hotel gym closed at night and not opened 24 hours. -All rooms already come with wine glasses, regular glasses, bottle opener, elastics, paper clips and large sized toileteries bottles. Has mentioned in previous reviews, lots of little environmentally conscious touches here. I just wished all hotels had rooms this well-equipped with things you actually need. Also, I didn't find the A/C as noisy as a lot of reviews pointed out. Free WiFi in rooms, works with iPhone and it's FAST. A real blessing and comes with the added benefit of not feeling nickel and dimed for everything. Deep-soaking tubs are another added bonus you will find here that a lot of upscale chain hotels don't have (including the Marriott Pinnacle next door, which I've also stayed at, and where you will pay a room rate in excess of 100$ more a night). Windows in the rooms open for fresh air, loved that. iHome clock radio in all rooms also, so you can bring your iPod or iPhone along and listen to your favorite tunes. CONS: -You have to be nitpicking to find anything bad here but I have to say, on upper floors, you will hear faint noises from the elevators. That's surprising given the rooms seem otherwise well-insulated, since I never heard my neighbors (rooms had the DND signs hung so they were definately occupied) and hallway noise isn't particularly loud. -Business centre is closed on weekends, so you have to use the front desk's computers, and there's always this feeling when doing so that you have to be quick since I felt I was intruding on the staff's working area. Otherwise, a solid hotel in downtown Vancouver. This loyal Hilton fan tells you to book it without hesitation, enjoy Vancouver, and I will certainly give other Coast Hotels in city centres a try should the need arise.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon, SK", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly beds, understated elegant decor, modern, green.\u201d", "Author": "50-ish-ers", "ReviewID": "UR70099224", "Content": "Stayed on 2 different occasions.

Had room 701 - which though not on a high floor has a peek-a-boo water and mountain view through the two buildings across the street. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and decorated beautifully. Enough room to do some stretching on the floor even! Having stayed in several of the hotels in downtown Vancouver, I found the room more spacious than any of the others. The bathroom is a generous size too. Extremely clean, well appointed and obviously 'green' conscious with recycling, organic waste and larger dispensers for the soap etc. (though the little ones are also available, you don't feel as guilty for opening a little one and throwing it away for one little use). The desk was comfortable to work at - as was the swivel, rocking executive chair. Downside was that the flat-screen tv was a bit small and it wasn't moveable (permanently fixed to the wall, would have been nicer to be swivel or something). Also, the air conditioning is curiously loud - I'd read that in other reviews and was amused to find myself agreeing. I turned it off since it wasn't too hot or cold. A bonus was the free wifi internet and the in-room coffee maker with torrefazione coffee and actual creamer (instead of powder). Also, lots of glasses (highballs, wine glasses and water glasses - 6 in total!) and a wine bottle opener - all very handy! Detractors were that the pool and hot tub are outdoors (which seems kind of dumb to me for Vancouver which doesn't get fantastic outdoor weather). Not only are they outdoors, but they're looked down upon by several floors of the office buildings that surround it - there is no privacy really at all. Maybe after the work hours, but I was considering it around 4pm when there were plenty of people still in their office. (I think the hotel should consider a gazebo around the hot tub or something). So instead of a soak in the hot tub, I opted for a workout. Nice gym, well appointed. The other big detractor is that the parking is valet only. It's not a bad price for Vancouver ($28/night) but I like to have the option to self park, and there isn't one with this hotel. It wasn't too bad on Wed morning, about a 7-10 min wait for my car, but I think i hit it at the right time and was leaving a little later. On the Thursday morning though, there was only one valet attendant and he was run off his feet with people arriving and leaving. It took 25 mins to get my car and I was 15 mins late for my meeting. So that was kind of annoying - the valet company needs to look at its staffing levels! The restaurant is expensive - not really worth it. $8 for oatmeal seems a bit ridiculous to me as is $14 for the standard eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. Other than that, the staff were all friendly, check-in was quick (though check-out was a bit slow with only 2 staff on and one stuck on the phone - we were lined up for several minutes). The hotel is well situated in Coal Harbour - it's a quiet, safe part of Vancouver. There aren't a huge number of restaurants in the 1-block radius, but they're not more than a few blocks walk. There are some handy places though very nearby - a 7-eleven in the same block, a Shoppers Drug Mart across the street, and an Urban Fare grocery store with lots of ready-to-eat take away food.

After a long flight from Australia, we were looking for a smooth check in and rest. The girl at the check in did not speak clear English, and did not seem confident of the procedures to check in. It took a while. She also did not activate our room keys, so when we got to our rooms, we could not get in. The bell boy had to go down, and we had to wait before this was resolved. Not a good first impression. The girl also had asked us if we wanted the newspapers( at a fee) or not. We had said no, and we also WROTE it down on the check in form. In the morning we found newspapers had been delivered to our rooms. We found having to chase up on these issues annoying as they should not be an issue. But the final cut was when we asked for an adapter as my husband requires a special machine to help him breathe during sleep. We were told that there were no adapters and none can be arranged. The reason we were given was that adapters were not returned and the hotel has now adopted the policy of not providing any adapters. We have never had this experience before. International hotels provide the adapters for use and if it goes missing then it is billed to the room account. This is standard practice as far as we know. When my husband told the staff this and offered to pay if the adapter is not returned, he was told that it was his issue, and to get it himself. If I may add the tone and manner in which this was said was rude and unacceptable. On the feedback form for the hotel there is NO section on how they can improve their facilities , services etc...so basically no section for you to write any criticisms!!! I found this laughable and ridiculous. The room air conditioner was very loud. On a positive note the beds were comfortable and clean, the bathroom was adequate. There is no separate hair conditioner provided. The only staff that smiled at us when we left was the tall blond gentleman who helped us load the luggage into the taxi. He was very helpful. I believe there are probably too few good staff at this hotel and the rest are inadequate and incompetent, and either lacking training or brains. Yes you could say that I am angry because we did not get good sleep or rest and this affected our stay and enjoyment of the city. Good luck to you to meet the few good staff or if you do not need help with anything and know the city well etc.. As for us we would not be returning, because as a brand new hotel they really do have a great competitive advantage in attracting guests but not if they get this sort of terrible unacceptable service.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kelowna", "Title": "\u201cSO SO\u201d", "Author": "ogopogie", "ReviewID": "UR60769495", "Content": "This hotel is so so.

Prices to be expected for down town Vancouver. I was disappointed in the amenities in the room. It was boring and plain. The price was right for an into rate of $129/night. On the upside I would say that I was treated well in the sense that I was given a complementary upgrade and had a wonderful view from my room (while my vision lasted).

The hotel is really good for business purposes, providing you get a discount rate. Location is perfect, only 5 minutes walk from the fair and our contacts' offices. The hotel is new, staff very (too ?) friendly, however I would find the whole place a bit too impersonal for leisure stays. I found the elevators quite noisy ; I asked to change room as I thought the noise was coming from the nearby ice machine, but then realized the elevator noise could be heard from everywhere. A bit of a pity that there is no minibar, or at least a can of water and orange juice. The bed was very comfortable.

The decor is sparse and modern. There is little warmth with just one piece of art and off white walls. Staff are friendly and always offer a greeting. I would say it is a solid 3 * hotel.

The staff is friendly, but many are still learning about the hotel themselves. I checked in and my room didn't have any hotel information about room service, amenities, phone operations, etc. Probably an oversite - but if a new hotel is trying to impress guests they should at least provide the basic how-to documentation. I also learned that all of my associates received a coupon for a complimentary app in the hotel restaurant upon arrival with their checkin docs -- along with a much more thorough welcome. The hotel needs to work to clean up inconsistencies. The biggest things that stuck out to me were: [1] the towels!!! I don't know where they're from, but they leave massive amounts of lint on every surface they touch! Beware - it's hard to get off. I was told it's because they're new - but I've never had new towels do anything close to this.... [2] They don't offer conditioner or hairdryers in the rooms. [3] There are no full-length mirrors in the rooms - would be easy to add to the back of a door. [4] The front desk never told me about the 'master switch' to turn everything on in the room - good to know about when you're trying to find your way into the space. [5] The fitness room was 20% operational the first day with treadmills only - no TVs or water or anything. The second day it was closed. I won't stay here again for awhile -- maybe down the road a ways, but there are way too many gaps in service and quality to make it worth while....", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Sonics", "ReviewID": "UR54520068", "Content": "I checked into this hotel on the first day it opened.

This is the first review. The property still had that \"new hotel\" smell. Checkin was quick, and we got our room early, before checkin time. Extended checkout was permitted upon request. Room was a decent size with big windows. It's a high rise with lots of high rises around, so our view was of the next building over. Room had a flat screen TV and soft, comfortable bedding. Internet was free (wireless, code provided on request from front desk), which was not expected since it was not advertised. Location is great -- just a block or so from the harbour, and 7-minute walk from the Waterfront SkyTrain station up Hastings Street. Can walk to Stanley Park in about 10 minutes. There's a grocery store and drugstore across the street, 7-Eleven around the corner, and several coffee shops nearby. More restaurants and shops are up on Robson St., which is a 3-4 minute walk up the hill. The hotel having just opened, missed a couple finishing touches in our room (forgot the remote and phone), but that was resolved in a couple minutes after notifying the front desk. Ice machines weren't yet installed, but Room Service was quick to bring ice on request.
