Just like me, you must be unfamiliar with the neighbourhood so some amount of suspicious is granted. Once you get there, you have to get into the gate and you'll see a big verandah of sorts. The hotel is inside a building so you go up the stairs. The reception is small and simple, with two friendly managers to welcome you. The rooms are small for sure, but very neat and aesthetically appealing with comfortable beds. The bathroom is also very clean. Meals are not inclusive, but they do serve some breakfast which includes delicious little croissants, muffins, cookies and your choice of coffee. Warm service, tidy rooms, affordable rates, good location - what more could you ask for?", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jyvaskyla, Finland", "Title": "\u201cGreat\u201d", "Author": "LechW", "ReviewID": "UR20935981", "Content": "The friendly staff, location close to Termini metro station and major bus lines, clean rooms and nice price give all the right pieces for the lovely stay at Sallecchia. Never mind the breakfast concentrating in cakes. There are plenties of shops and cafes around, if you want some heavier stuff to start your day with. The breakfast time was negotiable, as everything else. You asked for it and the staff did all they can. I enjoyed this. Grazie Simone e tutti i resti!

The room was not ready when i checked in, but I was promised it would be 45 -60 mins, so I went for a walk and visited Santa Maria Maggiore (5 minutes away). I returned over an hour and a quarter later and it was still not ready. The breakfast also lacks variety (though not quantity), and doesn't actually start until 8, not 7.30 as is claimed on their website. These minor quibbles aside, the rooms are clean and the staff friendly. The staff are all young (from 25-35) and only one speaks (a little) English, but they are helpful. I would stay here again because of the overall value for money. Having read some of the reviews of other Hotels near to Termini, this sounds like one of the best of the bunch. As mentioned in other reviews, there is no big sign on the hotel, so you need to look carefully by the doors to see the name plate. The hotel is directly opposite a laundry and next door to a shop called 'Amy's' or something like that. Turn left when you reach Via Principe Amadeo, not right. The Hotel is then on your right in 100-200 metres.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cNice place, good location\u201d", "Author": "GaryReg", "ReviewID": "UR20278608", "Content": "Sallecchia Hotel was what we booked but like other Hotels in Italy, the desk for Sallecchia Hotel actually put us into Anna's Bed & Breakfast and when we asked about another night for my son who was staying over, they couldn't confirm, so we went directly to Anna's office on the street. She confirmed right away. We liked the hotel, the location was great but Anna (or the principal lady in their office) gave us the wrong directions to the Ciampino Airport and my son missed his flight. Is it just me or do all Italians send you in the wrong direction when you ask for help? That was our experience in Italy.
