The rooms were priced similar in range to locations in Madrid with more facilities and better bars and restaurants. It was difficult to get an iron and to one they gave me kept tripping the electricity. Not an exciting event when one is in the shower and the place becomes completely dark! The room was decorated with minimal expense, the bathroom floor was green laminated timber and one almost had to climb over the bidet to enter the shower. The staff were very pleasant and spoke good English. Although hotel bar was quite limited, the location is well positioned to a couple of lively spots offering traditional Spanish food and drink. One word of advice when getting to the hotel \u2013 beware the taxi drivers!! Myself and some of my companions were over charged by drivers who were keen to make more than a few euro\u2019s extra from our party. Overall the room was comfortable and quiet and it was easy to access the centre of Madrid for Business. It would make a good base for city visitors. I would recommend a stay here for business or pleasure.", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBudget hotel near Madrid airport\u201d", "Author": "John S", "ReviewID": "UR131341898", "Content": "Good budget hotel near Barajas airport, Madrid.

Hotel has an underground car park,secure, 12 euros a day and as we were going away on a cruise for a week the following day ,decided to leave the car there for the duration and take the free shuttle bus to airport.Enquired to stay for a night on our return,but the price of a room suddenly increased to 157 euros so decided against that and just booked for overnight and the car park. Nice reception staff and our room was well designed for a small room, comfortable bed , and very clean. Even though there was a road outside there was little noise.Unfortunately there was nothing opened in the hotel for a drink or food ,as it was a weekend ,so had to find refreshment in one of the adjoining streets which had a couple of restaurants and a bar.More expense. Breakfast was the normal continental and cold hard boiled eggs. The service was professional and the airport shuttle was on time. On our late return the following Sunday the reception was open and we collected the car and drove home. I am sure there are better options for a cheaper hotel if you know the area but we only wanted a place for the night,near to the airport and most of the hotels in that area know that and can command a good price.
