I emailed Hotel Gramont to advise them of our cancellation, well aware that we would have to pay for the first night. Aurelie emailed me back and said that she was very sorry we had to cancel our stay, hoped my husband would be better soon and that she had put the room onto the internet and managed to rent it out. While it wasn't the same rate as we had booked for, I now only had to pay the difference, a savings of 144 Euros.

Overall, my experience at Hotel Gramont was really positive. First, the location is great, near the Opera house, Louve and two Metro stops. Could not be easier to get to/from the hotel. It's located on a side street in a business area so while it's a little noisy in the morning, it empties out at night and weekends are quiet. I walked down the street and in the area day and night and felt safe as a solo, female traveler. Second, service. I saw it was highly ranked for service and it absolutely lives up to it. Aurelie and staff were very helpful and polite by email and in person. I cannot thank them enough for helping coordinate airport transit, museum tickets and of course, restaurants. I fully credit them with getting me reservations at some amazing places in Paris. THANK YOU! Third, rooms. As a solo traveler, I booked one of the single rooms and was really, pleasantly surprised by it. Yes, it is small, but compared to other single European hotel rooms, I thought it was actually pretty spacious. The room gives space to move around, and the beds are pretty comfortable. The bathroom is modern and you have actual space in the shower. I was very pleased with the room. The only downside to them is that the walls, doors are pretty thin so you hear everything in the hallways, which can be a little noisy at night or very early morning. I also love that the front desk if 24 hours, which made me feel safe coming home at night from dinner, etc. Although I mentioned location is great (which it is), the only downside to it is that being a business area also means there isn't the cute charm of corner local businesses for breakfast and dinner. If you want those things, you have to travel for them. Not the biggest deterrent, but if that's what you want, it's not here. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place to other US travelers (especially solo ones) and would stay there again.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great service, would stay there agains\u201d", "Author": "AntonellaP67", "ReviewID": "UR126980807", "Content": "Great hotel in a side street, near Rue di Italians walking distance to metro, 2 stations.

There are two metro stops VERY close, one at the end of the block in both directions. Richlieu-Drouot and Quatre Septembre. Plus Opera is two/three blocks if you need more/different metro lines. It is on a quiet street, so street noise is not a problem. The most noise is from other guests slamming doors. They give guests coffee for free, but eating breakfast is pretty expensive. I'm sure it is good, but I've never eaten there. This is terrible to say - just call me an ugly American - but there is this AMAZING Starbucks that looks like a luxurious hotel interior complete with chandeliers and roman columns and painted cherubs on the ceiling.

Our ride which Hotel Gramont arranged for us was waiting upon arrival at the airport and the staff checked us in immediately even though we arrived the hotel 2 hours early.

I travelled with 3 family members and stayed at the quadruple room which is in fact 2 adjoining rooms on the 5th floor with a full bathroom (toilet & shower) in each room. The size of each room is sufficient for our needs, even found it roomier by European standards, and very clean and comfortable. Hotel is tucked away in a small block with business building offices so it is very quiet at night (great for a good night's rest). Yet Hotel Gramont is only within 2-3 blocks away from 3 metro stations and several bus stops that go into the different arrondisements in the city. It is about 5 blocks away from the les grands magasins (Galeries Lafayette, Printemps), Opera Garnier & the Roissy bus drop off point; about 7-8 blocks away from the designer clothing & food boutiques at Madeleine (Chanel, Gucci, Fauchon, Hediard, etc) and about a mile away from the Louvre and Musee D'Orsay museums. There are lots of brassieres and cafes a block or two from the hotel as well as boulangeries for your daily fresh baked baguette needs :). What is most impressive is how every hotel staff member shows that they really care about the guests. They make it their business to know you by face, if not by name, without being intrusive and always remaining professional with their work.

The Gramont is right in the middle of everything, you can easily walk to the Louvre, the Opera Garnier and Gallery Lafayette.

It's also one of the few hotels in Paris that has family rooms and our children slept very well on the comfortable sofa-bed. The rooms are nicely decorated and above all very clean, as are the bathrooms which are very small, but also very clean and adequate. My husband had been staying at hotel Concorde Lafayette (4*), while attending a congress before joining us at the Gramont, and he liked the Gramont much better as it was cleaner (chairs in the CF were broken and dirty), cheaper and so much friendlier. That's exactly what I am looking for in a hotel: it has to be clean and the staff have to be friendly. The breakfast, which we had at the hotel was good as well : croissants, pain au chocolat, bread to be toasted, 4 or 5 different jams, 4 to 5 meats,cheeses, fresh fruits, eggs , juices,milk, tea and coffee and more. But, to repeat what other travelers have already mentioned, the staff really are the best. They are super friendly and willing to assist in any way 'avec plaisir' . They made several phone-calls to make reservations in restaurants and had good suggestions about where to eat.

We booked the Hotel Gramont after its stellar reviews on TA. We were not disappointed. We took the Metro from the Paris Nord train station. The location was great. There were 3 different Metro stops in the vicinity- the biggest one (OPERA) was a 4 minute walk away. We arrived around 3pm and our room was ready (room 405). We had a room with 2 twin beds. The hotel and room were both very, very clean. Check in was a breeze and the front desk staff were very nice and helpful. Upon our arrival they gave us a Paris map and the code for free WIFI. That was a nice plus. Another nice plus were the fresh croissants (chocolate and regular) in the lobby. The room was small but it had everything we needed (safe, shower cap, shower gel, body lotion and a built in hair dryer (prob good for men but not so much for women). The ONLY reason this hotel did not get a 5 was because of the room noise (something a lot of people mentioned in prior reviews). Even on the 4th floor, you could hear cars go by and I even heard a woman walking with heels at 2am. We also heard the couple next door arguing and water rushing (maybe a toilet flushing). We woke up kind of late on our trip (9am) so there were times where someone was vacuuming outside our room from 8am on. There was also a small elevator which was nice.

What a disappointment! Perhaps reviewers discount their opinions because they allow for it being 'Paris'. Well I don't. I think that hotels the world over need to measure up to certain standards or be damned whether it is Paris, London or Manhattan, and I have stayed at better hotels in the latter two than I have ever in Paris. In the case of Hotel Gramont, I do agree that Aurelie and staff are magnificent. Without her the shortcomings of this hotel would not be as tolerable. Although in a reasonable location except for a noisy street, it has tiny rooms, minimal wardrobe space, paper thin walls, a minute safe, minimal ventilation, and in my case a bathroom with a persistent odour of something between the smell of boiled cabbage and a dead rat. On the plus side: a change of room was offered, the wireless internet is free although slow most of the time. Also, the buffet breakfast is delightful and good value at 13 euro, and there are lots of complimentary items such as water, tea, coffee, and croissants offered throughout the day. So the value add is reasonable, but the hotel misses out on its infrastructure. When they renovated the building they should have reduced the number of rooms and added soundproofing. The noise from the street and within the hotel seriously undermines sleep quality. It is really a Pensione not a hotel. It is a bit like staying as a guest in the attic in someone's small house with all the shortcomings that sometimes entails. Yes, you feel welcome but there is simply not enough space although everything is relatively new and the decoration is charming.

I booked online and took advantage of the internet deal of 143 euros per night for a single room (instead of 160), not including breakfast. It is definitely the case, as many people here have mentioned, that the staff at reception are fantastic: really friendly, incredibly helpful - genuine \u201cpeople\u201d people. They made me feel very welcome. There are some nice little extras - the coffee and croissants in the foyer for instance, and the fast free internet - help leave a great impression of this hotel. Having said that, it could only be in Paris that 143 euros a night for a single room would be considered good value for money: throughout Germany I stayed at many swisher places for far less than this (eg in Nurnberg, the Le Meridien = a 4/5 star property, was 103 euros including breakfast, for a room 3 times the size and with a real bathroom). Yes, Paris hotels are expensive, but still... I stayed in a room on the 5th floor, the room was very small and you need to watch your feet - there is an exposed beam which takes up a bit of space and it\u2019s very easy to bang into. If you live out of your case (which you need to because there isn\u2019t really the space to unpack here) you will be very crowded. The bathroom was very small (even the toilet was smaller sized than normal). It was fine for two nights but I would not have enjoyed a longer stay: I didn\u2019t see any of the bigger rooms so its entirely possible that this problem is restricted to the single rooms. The bed (a full single) was comfortable but the mattress was covered in some sort of a plastic cover which makes me really hot and uncomfortable. The second night I ended up sleeping on top of the duvet and covering myself with a towel, to avoid the problem. there is a fair bit of street noise so sleeping with the window open is not really an option unless you are a very heavy sleeper. You can hear noise from the corridor but it was not a big deal to me. The room was serviced well; the whole hotel seems clean and well cared for. The location is great - a 5 minute walk will have you in shopping mecca on Haussman; I caught a number of cabs because the weather was inclement and anywhere I went within the city seemed to be about 7 euros. So, in conclusion: I would recommend this hotel to some of my friends, but not to other. To me this is a very good 2-3 star property - definitely better than some of the grotty hotels I have stayed in in the past in Paris, but I am surprised that it is so high up on the list on TA: it can\u2019t be because its especially good value and it\u2019s by no means a higher-star rating than this so the only conclusion is that the great staff make the difference.

Value for the money is excellent. Hotel is very small and has excellent Parisian charm. Our room and bathroom were small, even by European standards, but it's a boutique hotel and we expected it based on the reviews. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. Upon arrival at the hotel we were offered complimentary (and delicious) pain au chocolat, butter croissants, tea and coffee. Tons of guide books in the lobby, free wireless Internet in the lobby and in the rooms, and a 3-minute walk to the nearest Metro station. In addition to the hotel's strengths, it's biggest asset is Sandra at the front desk. I can't say enough about Sandra, because she stole the show. I travel internationally for business regularly (11 countries in 28 days in this case, with Paris at the end), and I can't remember a member of any hotel staff in my 10 years of international business travel that was as genuinely amazing as Sandra. In addition to being incredibly helpful in recommending a restaurant for our Thanksgiving dinner and making a reservation for us there, she also took care of the airport shuttle service, made excellent tourist recommendations, and was just a lot of fun to have a conversation with. I even had a personalized email in my Inbox upon my return to the US from Sandra asking me how we enjoyed our flight back. She is nothing short of amazing and is the textbook definition of \"service with a smile\" that so many other service industries lack. Only two negatives that I can think of. A/C was disabled for cooling because the cold season had hit Paris, but we were a little warm in the room. Opening the window for 5 minutes fixed that problem. Not much of a complaint because it seems all of the boutique hotels do this. There was a bit of outdoor noise in our room (304) even with the window closed, so if you're a light sleeper this might cause a problem.

There is a reason this hotel is so highly reviewed on TripAdvisor. It\u2019s a true gem and a wonderful headquarters for a Parisian holiday. My girlfriend and I spent a week at the Hotel Gramont in September 2011. The location of the property is ideal. We walked everywhere. On those occasions when we found ourselves far from home at the end of a long day of exploring, there were several subway lines/stations within easy walking distance of the property. In addition, the Roissy bus from/to CDG is just a short walk away and is an excellent value (\u20ac10/pp with plenty of space for passengers and luggage). The rooms were well done and comfortable. We were assigned a top floor Double with balcony our first night (a guest failed to depart on time due to illness so our Double+ room was not available), before moving to the Double+ room (#305) we had reserved for the remainder of our trip. No issue for us as hotel explained the situation at check-in, offered a free breakfast for our trouble and moved all of our stuff to our new room as well. Room #305 was spacious for two people, the beds were great and everything was spotlessly clean. The room had a decent sized closet area, with a number of shelves for storing clothes and bags, a small flat-screen TV with decent selection of channels and a mini-fridge with reasonably priced items. The only downside to the room was the bathroom set-up. The room had a water closet (separate from the shower and sink, which were fine) that was about an inch wider than the toilet. It\u2019s nearly impossible to use the toilet in the room unless you\u2019re a contortionist. Overall though, Room #305 was very comfortable and spacious, especially for a couple. Our initial room on the 6th Floor was similarly comfortable and nicely done. It was up a set of stairs from the 5th floor elevator. Though smaller than #305, it did offer a nice sized balcony to catch some fresh air and a glimpse of the skyline. (I think the Hotel Gramont could take better advantage by making the balconies a bit more functional, perhaps adding furniture and plant life, to better market these assets). Closet was pretty limited and would likely require you to work out of a suitcase as there wasn\u2019t much storage space. Bathroom didn\u2019t present the issues of #305. Despite being a little smaller, we would have been perfectly comfortable in the Double room for the week (although anything longer than a week and the more limited space might have become an issue). The staff is unmatched. Every single person was friendly and helpful. Special recognition has to be extended to Sandra, who was the highlight of our stay. Ever trip through the lobby was met with a giant smile and a friendly conversation. She truly is a great ambassador for the hotel. The breakfast offered by the hotel is very good. There are plenty of tasty pastries, meats, cheeses, breads, coffee, juices, etc. served in a nice little breakfast room. And there was always an empty table. A great start to the day. Also, we very much enjoyed the cozy lobby set-up. There are several comfortable chairs and sofas next to a small bar. There were almost always complimentary croissants laid out, along with bottled still and sparkling water and coffee service. In addition, there were a selection of Paris tour guides, daily newspapers and enjoyable French music in the background. Free WiFi, available in lobby and guest rooms, was fine for web browsing. We truly enjoyed our week in Paris and a stay at this hotel was a big part of that experience. We would definitely stay at the Hotel Gramont our next time in Paris.

The manager then called another taxi told him to get there ASAP and when he got there she expressed the need to rush, felt bad for us and gave us 20 Euros which was such a very nice gesture on her part.

I would say however that it surprises me that it is rated number 2 quite simply because alot of the rooms face the front of the hotel, therefore the lower floors have a direct view of an office opposite so you have to keep the curtains closed if you are dressing etc. The hairdryer was a basic 1970's design with a hose from the dryer which was connected to the wall [you know the ones I mean].

It had two shower rooms. My parents stayed in the Duplex room, which they were thrilled to bits with, especially as it has its own terrace. My Nephew had a very pleasant single room and my Brother a double whilst fairly small had everything he needed and had very nice decor again spotless.

This was my 1st trip to Paris, and I was concerned about making a good choice of hotel. What a fantastic surprise! (Seriosly, you had me at hot fresh, chocolate croissant!) The staff was lovely, and did everything possible to make our brief stay extra special. The hotel, and room were exactly as pictured; compact, but spotless. At first glance, we thought the breakfast room must have been a bomb shelter, but after we got avtaste of the food, we forgot all about that. For a very small up charge, we added the daily break-feast.....pastries, cereal, yogurt, meat/cheese tray, fruit....and eggs cooked to order. An outstanding value, and so fresh & yummy. Fresh, warm croissants are almost always stocked in the lobby too. The location is very convenient, centered between 3 metro stops, with dozens of cares and restaurants within a 3 minute walk, as well as multiple small markets so you can stock the fridge in your room. It's an easy walk to the Lourve-I strongly recommend the Museum Pass (available at the front desk) if you are planning to go to more than 1-2 museums. It can be a bargain if you want to go to a lot of attractions, but the true value is in bypassing the ticket lines! We sailed past a huge line at the Lourve, saving at least a 45 minute wait. Since we were there in summer, the strong air-conditioning was very much appreciated. Besides being spotlessly clean, our room was also charming, with fresh, subtle decor. Still, it's Paris, and the room was quite......compact. There was an open shelf area, rather than a true closet. Storing large suitcases was a bit of a challenge. Through our stay, the staff continued to provide service over and above, getting a reservation at a lovely restaurant (Dorant), helping with directions, booking a car to the airport, and even offering us a bottle champagne as it was part of our honeymoon. The only con I can think of is that the neighborhood borders on a working class business district and was quiet over our weekend stay, yet slightly less than charming. Our window looked into an office building, and I imagine it could get noisy during business hours. Even so, the proximity to the sights far outweighs this slight drawback.

Are they posting their own notices? I stayed here with my adult daughter for 2 nights in July and we were very disappointed....... Firstly the twin room I thought I'd booked turned out to have a double bed and and extra camp bed (intended for a child I think?). The mattress on the camp bed was so thin that you could feel the metal frame through it. The double bed was hard and also uncomfortable. On investigation it turned out that it was actually a bed that pulled down from a wall cupboard!!!! There were no bedside tables or lamps just tiny alcoves in the wall and spot lights above. The second major inconvenience was the window - the room was on the ground floor with a window that opened directly onto the pavement of Rue Gamont. This meant that we couldn't open it at night or even safely during the day. We also couldn't open the curtains as passers by had a clear view into the room. We were in a perpetual twilight zone. After the first night I reported to the Receptionist that the room was so hot that we hadn't been able to sleep - she apologised and said there had been an over-sight and the centrally operated air-conditioning has not been activated - great! The basement breakfast room was reached down steep stairs and along a corridor cluttered with cleaning materials and boxes. The room was windowless, cramped and uninviting and the breakfast at 13\u20ac looked decidedly lack-lustre. We gave it a miss and enjoyed a great breakfast in the sunshine at a near-by cafe for 7\u20ac. A good nights sleep and a decent breakfast is surely the least to expect from any hotel and definitely from a hotel claiming 3 stars and charging 181\u20ac per night.

As for Arthur, well he saved us from our mother having a mini meltdown when we discovered that all taxis and shuttles were striking on the morning we had to go to the airport. We hadnt travelled on the metro during our trip so were a bit wary, but Arthur gave us step by step instructions of what lines to go on, how long for and all about the Orly bus. In the end thanks to his directions it was so easy, so thank you Arthur.

Loved the bathroom & shower. Plenty of hot water & good water pressure. The room was spotlessly clean, the cleanest place we stayed during our entire 2 week trip. The beds were very comfortable with great, high quality linens. After getting the lay of the city, I came to realize the location of the hotel couldn't have been better. Several Metro stations close by. Don't worry, the Metro is actually very easy. As an added bonus, the room had a small Juliette balcony with doors that opened onto a delightful side street. However, this street could be noisy at night. Breakfast selection was poor, especially for American selections. I'd skip it. Even though you're in Paris, be sure to eat at the Italian restaurant right next door to the hotel! Food was excellent! There's also a Monoprix just at the end of the block to get cheap snacks & bottled drinks. The hotel has free Wi Fi & it worked great on our smart phones.

Despite being only on the 1st floor it was surprisingly quiet, probably due to the good design of the windows. The location is excellent, cafe life on the Boulevard is only a hundred yads or so away and Boulevard Hauseman with its many shops is only a 10 minute walk. I chose the buffet breakfast for 13 euro at the hotel which is served in what appears to have been a wine cellar and enjoyed orange juice/multivitamin juice, cereals, dried fruit, yoghurt, french bread, toast and jam, coffee. Also available within the buffet was a choice of eggs, cooked meats etc, apple tart, pancake. There was a choice of four gourmet/speciality jams that were all delicious. My only criticism would be that a better choice of cereal would be appreciated (only corn flakes or a chocolate cereal on display) but the French are not so into cereals as the Brits. The wi fi worked well so I was able to keep up to date. There is also a computer available in the reception/lounge. I slept in a single room but the bed was queen size and quite comfortable. The shower was excellent. The room was a little on the small side but more than adequate for my needs. It would be unusual to find large rooms in smaller hotels in central Paris.

I\u2019ve relied on Trip Advisor to find hotel values in many large cities. Every time, the reviews have been accurate and I\u2019ve been happy with the hotel I\u2019ve selected. This time, the Trip Advisor reviews failed me. The Hotel Gramont Opera isn\u2019t bad, it\u2019s just not that good - and it\u2019s certainly not the fine \u201cboutique hotel\u201d that the reviews would have you believe. Instead, it\u2019s an overpriced three star hotel that, while clean and recently remodeled, has minuscule rooms and only an average location within Paris. I wish I would have used my critical thinking skills to ask how a 25 room hotel in a city of over 2 million people could rank so high. First the good. It has been mentioned many, many times in these reviews that the staff is accommodating and friendly. This is absolutely true. I interacted with several different people and all of them went above and beyond to make sure I was happy. As for the location, it\u2019s safe and close to the several restaurants and supermarkets as well as one of the main shopping areas in Paris. There are also several Metro stops nearby, making it convenient to any part of the city. Finally, the rooms are clean and have newer fixtures and decor. However, the beds are horrible - our \u201cTriple\u201d included two single beds that had been pushed together to form a double bed and a cot that had been labeled as a twin bed in the advertising. Now the bad. After staying at this hotel for several nights, I can\u2019t understand how it has secured so many overwhelmingly positive reviews. The rooms are so small that there is only room for the beds, which essentially fill the space from one wall to the other, leaving only two feet of clear space to walk. The bathrooms are clean, with new fixtures; but they are about the size of two telephone booths set side by side, making it difficult to maneuver and very stuffy after a hot shower. The only other furniture that can fit in the room is a small writing desk shoved into the recessed corner with a hard backed, four legged chair. Thankfully, there was ample storage space in a closet to fit our luggage, as there was no space for it in the room itself. The reviews here laughingly say \u201cit\u2019s Paris and rooms are small.\u201d But, for $250 to $350 per night, this hotel provides no value. Like many other places in Paris, they\u2019re over reaching at these prices. I\u2019d rather pay more for a nicer hotel. At least I\u2019d feel like I got some value for my money. In addition to the tiny rooms, there is no individual climate control other than the electric heat. Paris is humid during any season, making hotel rooms stuffy and hot. And, while I think that the hotel has climate controlled ventilation, it\u2019s controlled at the front desk and not in the rooms where the only temperature control is for heat. While I was there in March and April the cooling was turned off and it was stuffy and hot in the room. I\u2019d hate to stay here in the summer and have not access to individual climate control. Fortunately, the windows open allowing you to vent the \u201cfresh\u201d Paris air into your room. Unfortunately, Rue Gramont is quite noisy for all but four hours a night. Leaving the windows open, while a very a very satisfying way to cool the room in March and April, makes sleeping in the room only a step above sleeping on the street with respect to noise. Combined with the uncomfortable beds, this makes sleeping difficult. In short, the room size, uncomfortable beds, lack of ventilation in the rooms, and noise make staying in this hotel sort of like camping in a tent - satisfying if the price is right, but not very satisfying for $300 a night. Yes, the staff is nice and speaks English. Yes, the rooms are clean. And, yes the location is a 4 out of 5. But, the Hotel Gramont Opera is only average - not horrible, but not worthy of it\u2019s high rating on Trip Advisor. Did I hate this hotel? No. It was perfectly acceptable and I liked it more than I disliked it. Was it good enough to make me uncomfortable taking a risk on different hotel next time I\u2019m in Paris? No. I think I\u2019ll skip this place next time and look for something else. And, anyone who\u2019s reading these reviews should do the same.

One must-do is the restaurant known as Les Deux Magots(no need to give you directions,as everyone in Paris knows of it!).Once a haunt of Jean-paul Sartre,the food was superb,not over-priced,and the atmosphere was very welcoming.The Hotel Gramont Opera is to be recommended,-the staff,including Sandra(the manager) who is Swiss,and Aurelie who was extreemly helpful during our stay,aswell as the two young men who were on nights during our stay but whose names unfortunately we did not write down,could not have been more courteous or helpful,and made our stay there all the more enjoyable.Free use of the laptop in the foyer to check in on line made for a seamless departure(the hotel also organised our shuttle to and from the airport).The hotel is a perfect base for a short trip to Paris,very central to many must-sees,but down a quiet street for a peaceful night's sleep.It is expensive ,but then quality has it's price!", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cVery nice Boutique Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "VicHongKong", "ReviewID": "UR97969986", "Content": "We took the bus directly from CDG and got off at Opera Station.

The positives first: The reception staff was very helpful (when there, unfortunately, we had to wait for them to turn up on several occasions). The hotel is very well situated, close to two metro stations and the big department stores and theatre district. Lots of good restaurants closeby. The rue Gramont is a side street to the very busy Bld des Capucines but yet extremely quiet. Now for the less good things: The room was the smallest we have ever stayed in, like 4x4 meters including the bathroom. There was not enough cupboard space for 2 or even for 1 person I'd think - and we only stayed two nights with very little luggage. The safe didn't work although this was fixed pretty quickly when alerting reception. The breakfast was served in the basement and there were not enough tables (I would say about 10 seats!) for the guests who came to have breakfast. We asked for expresso or capuccino coffee and the waitress told us we could get this on the main boulevard in a coffee. The hotel only provided brewed coffee which smelt burnt and was really not nice. I decided to go for a cup of tea instead. They ran out of bread and did not refuel, same for the cheese and ham... Not impressed at all. Now the worst: Our very small room (I believe it was No 504) was close to the elevator and the maid's closet. We were promtly woken up at 7h30 on both Sat and Sun morning by the maid starting to make a terrible noise in her cupboard. We literally heard this as if she were inside our room. It was awful. The maid also had the bad habit of leaving dirty laundry and huge garbage bags in the corridor just outside our room and even in front of our door one - we actually had to move the stuff in order to get in. We travel a lot around the world and generally go by TA reviews and so far have very rarely been disappointed. However, in this case, I really fail to understand what all the positive TA are all about??? We paid 170 EUR per night. This is not cheap but standard for a decent hotel in Paris.

We weren't sure what was happening, and expected the staff member on duty there to advise us, but she ignored it . Along with the other patrons we were confused about what was happening and decided to leave, although the staff member continued to clear tables. It was indeed a fire alarm (caused by a guest smoking in their room).

There were a few English-language TV channels available. What really sets this hotel apart and makes it special is the front desk staff. They are outstanding! (And their English is excellent.) Because the hotel is so small, you are able to interact with individuals personally. My sense was that they really care about their guests. They went out of their way to be accommodating. For example, when asked for restaurant recommendations, we weren't just hand a list and wish \"Bon chance\". Instead a specific restaurant was chosen to meet our requirements.

It\u2019s very elegant for a three-star hotel, which plush beds, spotless rooms, and tasteful furnishings. Also, the service is truly out of this world. I\u2019ve seen Sandra run up and down stairs to accommodate all of her guests\u2019 wishes. The free croissants in the lobby are a welcome snack when you return from a day of walking throughout Paris. The blackout curtains in the rooms and the super comfortable beds make adjusting to the time zone easier. It\u2019s quiet, but both my friend who stayed in another room and I needed ear plugs. The hotel is small, so if someone climbs the stairs past or takes the elevator to your floor, you will hear them easily from your room. You can also hear voices easily, and the house keepers start work around 8 a.m. every morning, so bring ear plugs. You can control the temperature in your own room, which is always nice. The windows open so you can get fresh air. I had a single room and there was just enough space to pull my suitcase inside the door and around the bed to the storage space next to the bed. There is an aisle on two sides of the bed and that\u2019s the room, along with a clean, attractive, compact bathroom. The shower water is hot, but sometimes it fades cold and hot, not sure why. My friend was in Room 103 and the water leaked from her shower down to the lobby for some reason. I\u2019m sure they have that fixed by now. I was in Room 503 and could not get wireless reception from my room on a laptop provided by the hotel or a Droid. I was able to use the laptop available to guests in the lobby, but it had a French keyboard and it was not as convenient as having email at my fingertips from my room. I could get wireless in my friend\u2019s room on the first floor, so I think there is some reason the wireless could not reach my room. One of the reasons I chose the hotel was for the wireless, so that didn\u2019t work out as well as I\u2019d hoped. Also, the Opera subway station is about 4-5 blocks away. You\u2019ll pass a very elegant Starbucks on the way, so it\u2019s convenient to stop and get coffee before you start the day if you\u2019d like. However, note that the subway station is a 5-10 minute walk. There are other stations closer by, but you can\u2019t buy tickets there and there are fewer lines running through those. The Italian restaurant next door has delicious food. I love Italian food and recommend it. The lighting isn\u2019t great, but I noticed the lines outside at lunch on work days, so I know I\u2019m not the only one who likes the food. The hotel offers breakfast. I enjoyed it on 2 days. It\u2019s in the basement and they\u2019ve decorated it in a pleasing manner. I hope the level of detail in this description is helpful to those considering the hotel.

That said, we were only in Paris for 24 hours and it is very hard to give an in depth opinion over such a short space of time, especially as you hardly go to Paris to spend time in the hotel. Still, the Gramont is in an excellent location, overlooking a quiet street, and the rooms are pristine and tasteful. The bed was very comfortable and there was free wifi \u2013 large hotels take note \u2013 in the rooms. The teeny shower-room required manoevering to get around the wash basin, but it was also immaculate and seemed pretty new. Any longer and I think the room would have been just too small, but I believe there are bigger ones in the hotel.

We were not disappointed, it took us 7-8 minutes to walk to the Louvres and walk the most beautiful walk in Paris: from the Louvres, walk through the Jardins de la Tuilerie and keep a lookout for the Tour Eiffel, then cross the Place de la Condorde, stroll down the lively Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and end at the Arc de Triomphe.

I believe an obese person will not be able to reach the toilet seat in my room, as there was only a narrow gap between the sink and the wall to access the toilet. If you are obese, make sure you inquire about that all important detail. The room was very clean and cozy. My husband had a hard time sleeping on the first night, as his side of the bed was caving in a bit. My side was fine. This is the only criticism hotel Gramont will get from us. The best part of the Hotel was Sandra, our gracious and lovely innkeeper. She was always available to answer our zillion questions, always in a courteous and lovely manner. She answered every telephone call in the same way. She speaks German, English and French fluently and always welcomes all the guests with a warm and welcoming smile.

Elevator is small and only goes to floor 5 so you have to carry luggage if on 6th floor and you will do so in a very small winding staircase that adds to the charm. Location is fantastic with 3 metro stops. Opera being the main one that is just about 4-5 blocks on the main road. Hotel offers breakfast and will bring leftover breads to the lobby for anyone to enjoy later in the day. Small bar in lobby offers wine...cheapest we found anywhere! there are hairdryers, irons and umbrellas for your usage if needed. Beds very comfortable and rooms have AC if needed. We stayed over a weekend and Fri/Sat nights can get a bit loud on the street so you may want to close the window and us the AC. This of course can not be controlled by the hotel.

A peaceful night's sleep was easy. The staff are very helpful and speak English, but were happy to let me try to use my schoolboy French too. When we sought advice on how to get to the Moulin Rouge, we were advised to take a taxi; this was sound advice and worked perfectly. The hotel is situated within two minutes walk of two Metro stations, making travelling round Paris very straightforward, even for novices. As the centre is relatively compact, then it's worth taking the Metro in one direction, and walking back to the hotel. Don't worry about getting lost because Paris is very well-signposted and the hotel is situated close to the Paris Opera Garnier. The area abounds with superb shops too. The Louvre, Orangerie and Musee d'Orsay are all conveniently situated within a short walk. The Tuileries gardens are superb, and take on a completely different aspect when the sun shines. Be prepared for the traffic. It never, ever stops! Take care when crossing the roads, (as you would anywhere else). Whilst it is possible to hire a taxi or shuttle from CDG airport, we chose to use the RoissyBus which worked perfectly for us, and as it goes directly to the Opera, it delivers you very close to the hotel.

Two amenities we particularly enjoyed were the location and the free internet. The location is superb! Walk 10 minutes south and you\u2019re at the Louvre. Walk 15-20 minutes north, and you\u2019re in Montmartre. The Opera Garnier is only 5 minutes away and there are SO many caf\u00e9s and places to eat all around the hotel. The free internet was our lifeline home. We emailed and uploaded our photos during our downtime. It was something we really wanted and it worked fantastically. We also stayed in two different rooms. We spent half our time in the Duplex room and half our time in a quadruple room. If you\u2019re trying to judge space, the quad and duplex are the most similar to an American size hotel room. The Duplex room also comes with breakfast included, a definite plus, and has a cute rooftop terrace. We were able to enjoy a bottle of wine outside most nights and thought it was a definite plus to our experience. The quad rooms also come with two bathrooms. We didn\u2019t need them both, but I could see how they would be handy for more than two guests in a room. In closing, this was an amazing experience.

Everything was perfectly clean and the beds were very comfortable. The staff members spoke perfect English. The hotel lobby had a PC for guests to use for free and a supply of complimentary croissants. The location was great, with a zillion restaurants and cafes a block away on Boul des Italiens. Be aware that restaurant and cafe checks include the tip, despite any waiters' claims to the contrary.

There are 1, 2, 3, and 5-day unlimited ride tickets available. We were able to go everywhere we wanted with at most one change of trains. Breakfast at the hotel was OK, but I would recommend going out to one of the cafes unless you're on a tight schedule and need to save time. There were a couple problems. One of the TVs lost its signal on our second night and the hotel was unable to get anyone to fix it during the remainder of our stay. The WiFi reception in our room was intermittent, which I suspect was due to a weak signal (WiFi in the lobby worked fine). The room was also a bit noisy, and we could hear kids running around the room above us.

Very close to the 'Open Top-Hop on Hop Off' bus tour start point (just behind the Opera building) which we found invaluable for an overview of all the attractions, even though the queues were very long and we decided not to hop on and off we don't feel we missed getting to know Paris and at 32Euros for 2 days (4 routes) good value. The hotel cannot be faulted, excellent welcome at the reception, very clean rooms (and I am fussy!) comfortable beds, the bathroom is a bit small, bit so what? The hotel is located on a side street which was quiet during the night particularly on the weekend nights, Monday morning it started to get noisy around 6am, but you need to be up early to cram everything in on a short trip. We thought breakfast at the hotel was excellent, a very wide selection of continental foods but also scambled egg, lovely coffee and very reasonably priced at 12Euros, local cafes were asking for 16Euros and there didn't appear to be the selection we had in the hotel. One big bonus on the trip was the journey from the airport, I had previously read on Tripadviser about the Roissy Bus, this leaves terminal 2D Gate 11 at the CDG airport and drives straight to the Opera district, no stops, so you don't have to worry about where to get off. The hotel is a short walk, around 5 minutes, from the drop off point. You can also catch the return bus from the same spot back to the airport, although on the way back it will stop at all the terminals. The cost is 19 Euros return and definitely worth it. A couple we met had 2 metro changes and stood for the journey with their cases, not ideal. It was our first visit to Paris together so we had to cram a lot in and there is a fair bit of walking so flat shoes everytime. There are plenty of bars and cafe/eateries close to the hotel, including Italian, Chinese, Japanese, obviously French, and even a McDonalds, which might keep the kids happy.

The location is great, two minutes walking from underground station (Quatre Septembre) and five minutes walking from Opera. The area is full of restaurants and shops. You can reach Printemps and La Fayette with a little stroll. Also Place Vendome is within a walking distance. Last but not least the cordial and friendly staff. Sandra and Aurelie was very very nice, helpful, full of suggestions and smiling, they feel like at home, like a friend. I have been in Paris for Whitney Houston concert who has been cancelled at the last moment. Aurelie has been very very nice, sweetly attentive to help me to have the refund of the ticket. Last day there has been also a strike of train worker and she was ready to inform me about alternative transports to airport. Together with the wonderful beauties and monuments in Paris, they are part of my happy memories of the holiday. I will comeback in Paris because I love this city, I have a lot to vist again and I will comeback to Hotel Gramont to call in on Sandra and Aurelie and have another pleasant stay. I suggest this best value hotel to everybody.

The room we've got is large and well furnished, in particular with huge and comfortable beds; the bathroom is clean and fully equipped.

The hotel has been recently refurbished with good soundproofing, really suberb heating (silent, responsive) better than even expensive hotels, clean, and quiet. Although some cars and motorbikes go down Rue Gramont, this is rare at night; it is usually so quiet that the main noise is the footsteps of pedestrians. Less than 100m from the 8 and 9 metro lines and 150m from the Opera station so there are about 5 metro lines close by. Breakfast is generous in a barrel vaulted cellar. The main feature, however, is Sandra, ever helpful, kind, polite, knowledgable, and truly interested in the welfare of her guests.

We choosed it because of the good reviews. Well, if you want to have a charming little hotel in a perfect location with a very friendly and helpful staff...this is the place you should stay!!! You should not expect a 5 star hotel, because that is not what you will find...it is still a 3 star hotel, but probably the best 3 star hotel in Paris and way better then most 4 star hotels in Paris. I f you think the price is too high...well Paris is just an expensive city and maybe there are other cheaper hotels but probably not so clean and nice...But let me describe it a little bit more detailed :-) Location: The hotel is in a quiet small street...a lot of cafes, brasseries and restaurants are just around he corner and they are all not too expensive with good food....and for those who don't like French food...a Pizza Hut and a Mc Donlds is just 3 minutes away :-) You walk about 10 minutes to the Louvre and metro stations are also really close!!! The area is very safe and you should not have a problem walking during the night around there. Rooms: The rooms are not very big, but everyone who was in Paris before knows that this is normal in Paris...you can't expect a big room with chairs and a sofa like in the United States for example, but the room is very clean and knew...the beds are good to sleep in and when you really want a bigger room...just get a triple room then you have a sofa and more space :-) You also should to try to get a room in an upper floor because even when the street is really small and the windows are sound proofed you still can hear a little bit of the streets, but not too much so don't be worried about it :-) But on an upper floor you would probably here nothing at all...also try to get a room number with a 01 or 02 ending...just like 401, 402 oder 501, 502 because they are at the end of the hallway where you won't here anyone. Hotel: It is small with just 25 rooms but that makes it charming...you have a laptop at the lobby with free internet access and also free wifi in the hotel. There is no pool or fitness center or anything else to do in the hotel but in city like Paris you don't need things like that. Food: The breakfast is wonderful. You should not forget that it is a really small hotel and normally French people don't eat that much breakfast but what you get in this hotel is really great...juice, milk, tea, coffee, hot chocolate...fruits, scrambled eggs, bread and a lot more!!! We really like this place and when you want something special...get the Duplex room...it has a nice balcony to sit on...we had the chance to take a look at it and it is really, really nice....perfect for couples!!!", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable and stylish in a quiet , convenient street.\u201d", "Author": "sevenstiles", "ReviewID": "UR60007400", "Content": "Just returned from a long weekend staying at the Gramont.

Good points, the d\u00e9cor is fresh, rooms are clean, staff efficient, breakfast at \u20ac12 is better than average and served until 11:00 am if you want a lie-in.

The rooms themselves are adequately equipped, clean and well serviced with comfortable beds and decent linen. Provided you like living in a very confined space! Submariners and the little people will love it. There was hardly any room around our bed, opening the door to the bathroom completely blocked off access from one side of the room to the other. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever experienced in a hotel, the lavatory was tucked under the wash-basin and unless you have the agility of a gymnast you will find bathroom activity something of a challenge. Entrance to the wardrobe space and safe was via a narrow gap in the bedroom wall, it contained some shelves and a hanging rail. However it was unlit so we groped in the semi-dark for clothing or use of the safe. How anybody of above medium girth could access the wardrobe I do not know.

We managed to get a slightly earlier check-in and were (thankfully) given a room on the top floor. The room was clean and since it was recently renovated, everything was in tip top condition. The only gripe was that the room was on the small side and we had some difficulty with placing 2 huge luggages plus 2 other roll ons in the room but this is not unusual in Paris/Europe. The hotel is located on a quiet street so you did not get the noise from much traffic or pedestrians. Other than a few drunken youngsters screaming as they walked down the street on the weekend, overall peace was much desired. The hotel was within walkiing distance to most major areas: Lourve (abt 15 mins), Opera and the major dept stores (10-12 mins), We even walked to The Sacred Heart which took us a bit longer but was a leisurely walk through quaint and quiet streets. Another great thing about the location was that there is a supermarket 3 mins away and also a whole street of Japanese/Korean/Chinese restaurants a block away. Although there is a Metro station near the hotel, it's an unmanned station; meaning if you needed to buy carnet of tickets or to buy a ticket to Versailles, you need to walk to the Opera station about 10 mins away to buy it from the counter.

The other female staff (sorry didn't get her name) helped us call for a doctor and to translate when my partner fell ill on one of the days.

The location was perfect, being so close to the tourist attractions like the Louvre was great, as we could walk everywhere. The staff were really lovely, all actually interested in talking to us, which was nice, as sometimes in bigger hotels you can feel a bit anonymous. We loved the rooms, they were beautifully decorated and clean (and the beds were very comfortable). The only thing I would say is that we would have preferred a double bed (we got two singles pushed together - but we did get this at other hotels in France - so maybe just a cultural thing?!?) All in all would highly recommend for someone looking to stay in the centre of Paris and wander the streets looking for great food/sight seeing. Thanks again to the staff!", "Date": "February 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "georgia", "Title": "\u201cTotal Class,comfort and convenience...A Home Run all they way!!\u201d", "Author": "GeorgiaArtlover", "ReviewID": "UR54830703", "Content": "It was our first visit to Paris and from the moment we arrived, the staff was welcoming and efficienty helping us to get comfortable in their lovely hotel.
