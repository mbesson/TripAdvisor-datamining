Our bed is small for a couple. And we did get annoyed by the noises in the late night. So which room and rate one will get did contribute to the non-uniform ratings people posted here. I feel the hostal may be understaffed and our room did not get cleaned up even once during the three nights we stayed. Hostal Horizonte is decorated with a lot of antiques and collections the owner collected from his travel but the lighting is so low that I don't think many guests would be enticed to appreciate them. Rent is cheap, so I do not complaint. Location is great (for Sol, three museums, airport and train), except if one will be coming from/going to the bus station direction. Taxi will cost 15 euro or more. Then, it'd be better to find something to trade more values off by 15 euro for a stay in Madrid. It may be also a little too hot for the rooms facing the street during the summer. The shower is on the other side of the hostal so once you get sweaty, you have to think about whether to walk across the hall way just to get some moist.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whangarei, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cA greta quite hostal\u201d", "Author": "crassell", "ReviewID": "UR114795582", "Content": "We stayed in the King Alfonso XII room which had its own bathroom.

Julio, the hotel owner, was so kind to wait for my arrival. So a better start of my vacation is not imaginable. The hotel has a very nice atmosphere because of the colors and the scent of incense; just as a vacation should be like: laid-back. The rooms also are decorated attractively. I had one of the smallest rooms, but it's good enough. From the hostal to the plaza mayor is a 5min. walk. And although it's situated in a busy street the hostal itself is relatively quiet. Julio is as nice as most Spanish people and can give you good advice when you want to see something specifically.

It has 2 types of rooms - basic sleeps with shared bathrooms (very clean) and rooms with private bath. If you just need a place to crash, it\u00b4s fine. But you need to contact Julio by email because he is rarely around to answer the phone. I stayed there 2 days in mid March and then Easter weekend. He tends to be around in late afternoon only. So you must give him a definite arrival time by email. If you just show up he is unlikely to be there. Also the cancellation policy is tough. He requires a credit card for the bookings and will charge a day\u00b4s rate if you cancel in less than 7 days. I got stuck because of the cancellation policy. I tried to check out after 2 nights and was told that I would be charged a penalty of one night rate for \"cancellation.\" I knew of this policy but thought it applied to cancelling a booking before it started. So my advice is to use this hotel for short stays or as a back-up when availability is tight.", "Date": "March 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Acton, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGood Location and Clean, but Also Can be Noisy\u201d", "Author": "RTWtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR2699003", "Content": "This hostel is in a great location in Madrid and you can expect to find clean rooms and bathrooms.
