If you read my other reviews, I generally, if anything, lean toward giving hotels the benefit of the doubt and think most cranky reviewers on TripAdvisor have an axe to grind. Not so in this case! It is literally the only hotel where I slept in my clothes on top of the bedspread for fear of what was under the sheets. I wouldn't put my suitcase down on any soft surface for fear of bedbugs. There were dead roaches scattered across my windowsill, and more in the hallway. In the morning, when I went to take a shower, I turned on the fawcett and brown water came pouring out (it did eventually run clear, and I did take a shower in it and survived, though). Stay as far as possible away from this place! If you have a missed connection at the airport and are offered this as a place to sleep, just camp out in the terminal instead.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cRat hole!!!!\u201d", "Author": "meemawof5", "ReviewID": "UR68087715", "Content": "I traveled 400 miles to give my daughter and son n law their first baby shower. A VERY special event for us all. Upon arriving at this poor excuse for a hotel with a set time to meet the banquet coordinator,unload items for the shower and decorate, I was told the banquet coordinator was not available and could not be reached by phone. I was also informed that we could not have access to the rooms until later in the day. We drove back to my daughters which was an hr drive. When we came back that afternoon to get ready for over 100 guest we were told by the manager that the elevator would not work without HER key but she would make herself available at all times to escort our guest to the 4th floor, most of our guest had to climb 4 flights of stairs just to enter a room that was so HOT that the 3 tier cake melted and the top layer fell off. The temps outside were well over 100 degrees and the humidity was unbearable. The room was just as HOT My daughter which is 8 months pregnant nearly fainted from the heat. When I complained about the heat in the room, I was told to keep the door closed leading into the hall way because there is NO air conditioning in the hall. Kind of hard to keep the door closed when you have a 100 guest arriving. Do yourself a favor, don't waist your money on this place. This place should be condemned. It is filthy and not fit for animals to stay in.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cCan you say NASTY?!\u201d", "Author": "CathKorp", "ReviewID": "UR54616995", "Content": "Where to start?

Do not stay at this hotel! My mom, aunt and I booked this hotel for a four night stay in November 2009. First of all, do not let the name fool you. This hotel is not near the airport. Secondly, it is disgustingly dirty and infested with cockroaches. We arrived at the airport at about 930pm and called for the airport shuttle, using the phone at the airport. The man who answered said they did not offer airport shuttle service. We advised we were looking at a sign at the airport stating otherwise. He then admitted they did have one but it is broken at the moment. He suggested we take a cab. We asked if we would be reimbursed for this. He said he did not know, but he could ask the management tomorrow, and we may be given half of the cab fare back. (which was $22.00 USD). Whatever. That part was no big deal. But the big problems started after we checked in. The rooms were DISGUSTING! And I don't mean there was a stain on the wall, or a hair in the sink. I am talking cockroaches. Lots and lots of cockroaches. Oh, and mold. Lots and lots of mold. In the end, we moved rooms three times, and every single one had cockroaches and mold, as well as a host of other smaller issues. During one traumatic hotel room move, we followed an employee to the laundry room as he was going to get us additional towels. He opened the door, turned on the light, and an army of cockroaches ran for cover. They are literally everywhere. Eventually, at midnight, we checked out as we were too disgusted to fall asleep. Literally, we left in our pajamas with no idea where to go or how to get there. We just could not stay in that filth for one more second. Please, do yourself a favor and do not stay here. By the way, we ended up staying at the Radisson at the Airport, which was super clean, comfortable, and was actually close to the airport.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cSleep in your car rather than stay here.\u201d", "Author": "123wjs123", "ReviewID": "UR47142347", "Content": "Booked a room over the Internet at $67 but on arrival we were qouted a rate of $95 which, to give the desk clerk his due, was corrected to $67.

I had to tap the desk and call hello some times and then he comes over. He was not at all intrested in us. He was yawning and stretching constantly while talking to us. He checked us in and gave us a room key. The main hallway was good but as soon as we got to the second floor, the flooring was bad, torn and damaged carpet/tiling. We got to our room and the room is filthy. Pieces of hair on the bed. The bathroom was all smelly and stained. The walls and roof has stuff coming off. There was a small cockroach roaming around in the tub. This really grossed us out. We went back to the front desk and asked him if there was any better room. He said oh may be facilites missed that room and gave us another room. The new room had same issues but atleast no cockroach that we would see.

Very nice staff and eager to answer questions, but dark, old hotel. Looks like it was a former Holiday Inn that's been converted to an independently owned Ramada. Lots of things had Ramada stickers placed on top of the old Holiday Inn name, even on the ice bucket. Hallways were dark and had a weird smell. Carpet was old, worn and torn. My kids' feet were filthy from walking on the carpet. Even if you vacuum, you can't get that out without replacing the carpet. Doors and walls had chipped paint, torn wallpaper, etc. The back security entrance was propped open with a folded newspaper. There were NO cars in the parking lot when we arrived in the early evening. More were there when we came back from dinner but they were all gone early the next morning. The room itself wasn't horrible, but it wasn't nice either. The hallways were musty and muggy and so was our room. We cranked the a/c and it did cool it off enough that we wanted blankets that night but weren't about to pull the bedspread up over us. They'd tried to fix the pillows and fold down the sheets so it looked nice. Bathroom was tiny and hard to see with the light that was in there. No fan in the bathroom so it got hot. Towels seemed to be new but evidently they hadn't washed them because we had towel fuzz on our faces after drying off. Tried to eat breakfast the next morning. Staff kept saying they offered breakfast but no one would say if it was included with the room. Got to the restaurant and didn't see anyone eating or working there. Could smell something cooking but the restaurant didn't look like anyone had been in there. The bar was completely empty. A worker asked if we were trying to eat. When we asked if it was included, he asked how much we paid for the room. When we told him we booked it through a discount site, he said no, it wasn't included. Then proceeded to print a receipt for the room, even though we paid through the 3rd party site. The receipt had our name but a different credit card and a different address. Not sure who it belonged to. We were just anxious to check out. It's in an industrial part of town. Definitely not a nicer part of East Memphis like up on Poplar. We're sure the staff is trying, but the place needs a complete remodel not just new towels.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "st. louis", "Title": "\u201cabsolutely horrible-don't do it, keep searching\u201d", "Author": "melSt_Louis", "ReviewID": "UR33271734", "Content": "We were very excited to finally just get away from home for awhile and low and behold we stayed here.

All of this is true and happened to me this week (april 13-14, 2009)!! During my stay at this Ramada Inn in Memphis, TN my experience was unacceptable for a few reasons. Upon my check in on April 13th I was told my room cost $80.00 even. I paid cash for my stay. * The first room I was given had a broken TV. The front desk did move me to a new room. * This new room had a broken toilet. Again the front desk moved me to a new room where I was able to stay for the night, despite the spiders in my bed and bathroom. * In addition to this hassle, there were no working ice machines on my floor or the floor above me. * And the elevators were unreliable and smelled of mildew. * Upon my check out I received my receipt and took the shuttle to the airport to catch my plane. I accepted the issues that this hotel had and did not complain or ask for a refund. At the airport I inspected my receipt which stated that the cost of my room was only $63.78. This is including accomodation, sales tax & occupancy tax. ...yes, I should have looked at that receipt before I left, so this is why I don't expect anything in return from this hotel, as it's my word against theirs. Ultimately, what happened was the individuals operating this hotel stole $16.22 from me. I have tried several times to contact this Ramada to speak with the manager. I was told my call would be returned which it has not 4 days later, and every other time I call about my situation I am sent directly to voicemail or told the manager is in a meeting. I am extremely upset with the poor service and experience I had with Ramada. Most importantly it's upsetting to have money stolen from me. Not to mention that I believe a bait and switch tactic was used on me as well. I was originally quoted $69 for the stay, but had to pay $80. So with all this said, I advise you to never stay at this Ramada Inn.
