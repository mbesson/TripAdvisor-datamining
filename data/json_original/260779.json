However, we were greatly disappointed. First, we had to check in at the hotel (I think it's called Hotel Grand Canal, it has a red awning) a few doors down. Then we had to go back to the Airone, which is a second story floor with no elevators. My friend and I each had luggage and it was quite difficult to carrying 40lb luggage each up a flight of stairs. The room was small and did not feel very clean. My pet peeve is that the private bathroom that we paid extra for had the toilet and shower head placed on a platform together. A toilet and shower together? Really? It was disgusting having to shower with the toilet a foot away from you. Hotel Airone is actually a hostel and although it was cheap, I would've paid the extra cost for a better room. There was not hot water at times and they don't have any amenities: no shower cap or hand soap and we had to go to the lobby of the Hotel Grand Canal to ask for a hair dryer. Definitely stay away from Airone and don't let the other positive reviews fool you. I know Venice can be expensive but this \"hotel\" was really beyond ridiculous. The only positive thing about it is that it's close to the Ferrovia station and a quick walk from the train station. However, since all the sights are by San Marco, it's still a 30-40minute vaporetto ride.

The city is truly beautiful and if you have the right person to go with will give you enough memories to last a life time. However there are a few bad points. Firstly this has got to be one of the most expensive cities ever, 9 euro for a cup of tea, 4 euro a slice of Pizza, 4.5 euro half a beer so watch the pennies! Couple of hints are DONT eat around Rialto or St Marks go to Ferravia where prices are much better, Watch the cover charge at restaurants, in some it is 5 euro which adds up. Get a ACTV pass for the Vaporetto well worth it and go on a Traghetto Not a Gondolar, same boat but one costs between 80-300 euro and the other 50 cent! Okay time for the really bad point. Whatever you do DO NOT stay at the Hotel Airone on santa croce. This is a supposedly 2 star HOTEL but has to be worst hotel i have ever stayed in, and that includes North Africa! The photos on their website are complete rubbish, i attach mine which are genuine. They have no reception, you press a buzzer and then are given directions to another hotel down the street where you pick up a key and they ask you to pre pay, DONT DO IT, pay on leaving. You the go back to original door , open it and are met by the sight of mouldy torn carpet on stairs that are falling apart with great chunks of plaster split and falling off the wall! At the top of the stairs is what used to be a reception but is now used as an open storage facility for laundry....classy eh? Your room is best described as a shoe box except that shoe boxes do not have bare wires dangling in them and wall paper falling off the walls. Bathroom is a sliding door and you get a squirty hand wash with 4 towels. Double bed is 2 singles pushed together and i was lucky as got extra ( see photo of dead fly in bed!)
