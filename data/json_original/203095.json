The hotel was easy to find. I checked in and went to room,it did look like they still had to finish cleaning the bathroom,when I came back from a walk it was cleaned.

The room we had was large spacious with a wonderful outdoor patio, large bathroom with Jacuzzi tub. The room also had a living room area and terrific spacious closet. I was very impressed with the carful attention to details. The maid service surprised us daily. She would not only do the usual cleaning but each day would leave something special. Flowers on the bed. Goodies to snack on. A surprise extra touch which made out stay even more lovely. The restaurant staff in the hotel would go above and beyond. My wife has celiac disease, a wheat allergy. A problem for the best restaurants. This staff not only was careful to provide gluten free meals but went out of their way to get supplies of gluten free foods especially for my wife.

The bedroom was slightly smaller than is consistent with the period but was immaculate and an artistic delight.

The hotel is located near an area of restaurants and eateries and if you are looking for a nice Italian meal, I would recommend Mamma's Angela which is also located along Via Pelestro. The whole theme of the hotel is Art and retro so it is quite nice, they also offered complimentary services such as free coffee/tea/water to room, international papers etc. The reception staff was friendly, usual of Italian hospitality. One complaint about the hotel, the walls are quite thin and we could hear our neighbors walking along the corridor. Do ask for a room NOT facing the road as it can get quite noisy at night with cars and ambulance siren. As for the buffet breakfast, the variety is OK but we got sick of the selection after 3 days.

Here is a summery of our experience. We had quite an eartly morning flight. Upon booking the hotel, we requested an early check in. When we arrived at 11am, we were told in no uncertain terms that we would not be able to gain access to our room untill 2pm. As there was nothing we could do, we just headed out and found somewhere fr a spot of lunch. When we finally got into our room I have to say the stnadard really was good, the beds were comfy, the bathroom was clean and the docour was what one would expect from a hotel with the name Art Deco. The only thing we found, although amusing for us but those with young children, or who find these sort of things offensive was that directly opposite our room on the other side of the street was a sex cinema, the trail of men coming and going may make some people feel uneasy, however you are perfectly ok inside the hotel. The following morning, we went down for breakfast. The breakfast room really is not sufficient for the number of guests. Once we had found a table, we had almost had a stand up row with a woman who thought she should have the table, despite arriving after us. There was hardly any food, once we had mentioned this to a member of staff, all we got brought out was a bread roll (not what you would expect). We complained to the reception (the same guy from the previous day), and we got the usual Italian indifference. We then decided we would not bother with breakfast in the hotel for the remainder of our stay. The area around the hotel is ok, easy to reach the main attractions, and there are pleanty of little bars and restarants around without having to go too far, also as it is away from the main tourist area, these places are a bit cheaper.

The desk staff were helpful and friendly, spoke English well and even joked around with us when we checked in. The room was not humongous, but not having any other Roman hotels to compare it to I would say it was certainly adequate. Even though we had gotten the 'standard double', it came with a large enough bed which was actually quite comfortable, a small fridge, t.v. safe and desk. In fairness, this was the smallest bathroom we had during our two week stay, but hey -- it's a bathroom. On the topic of bathrooms, the only complaint I would really make about the hotel (and it is of a semi-personal nature) was that the toilet pressure in our room on the 4th floor was sufficient to flush about one piece of toilet paper at a time... so any interaction with the toilet tended to take about 4-5 times longer than an average bathroom pitstop! Breakfast was standard, neither superb nor terrible... as long as you like pastries, yogurt and fruit you will find everything you are looking for there! The neighbourhood, despite being near the train station, feels very safe at night, quiet but enchanting... while walking home a few nights after dinner, my wife and I felt like we had rented out the streets to ourselves because they were so quiet, it was very charming.

I had read in other reviews that the wifi probally wouldn't work in our room, but we had no problems at all. I also loved the decor through out the hotel, and our room was no exception. We very much enjoyed breakfast each morning. We had been told by friends that European breakfasts are rolls and coffee. So that is what we expected. Boy were we suprised when we found eggs, Italian bacon, rolls, cereal, cakes, an amazing cheese tort, yogurt, juices, fresh fruits, and yes of course coffee. I don't think we could have found a better breakfast. The dining room staff were very polite, and quick to bring us coffee. It was quite a let down to come home and have to make our own breakfasts. On days we left the very early to go on day trips, we were still able to have a wonderful breakfast. We thought our best hope was maybe we could maybe get a cup of coffee to go. Not at Art Deco! They prepared boxed breakfasts for us. This was something we never expected, and something we will never forget! Thank you Jose and kitchen staff!

The bed was hard but i found it no problems after my enormous days of walking- so no worries, pillows great! Cleaning people very thorough, bathroom awkward but i liked it- culturally interesting and clean. Loved having a bath and took advantage of it twice a day to rest my weary legs! Elevator is not for tall or 'large' people but stairs are soft underfoot, elevator was also fun to try just for the sake of it. Didnt hear much from the outside and loved being able to open the windows to look outside at the quaint cobblestone streets. Wake up call on time and air con worked fine. Safe also worked well. Not far from the main termini but when sightseeing you should use the closer station- castro pretoria. Quiet location, near turkish embassy. I would totally recommend this hotel.

It wasn't a huge deal, and since it was our first time in Rome, Italy for that matter, we didn't mind. If you're looking for a hotel that IS centrally located, you probably need to look elsewhere. My main concern, after reading the reviews, was the size of the room and the bathroom. Both were great. The furniture was a tad on the low side, but other than that it was a nice sized room...it was a double on the 2nd floor. We looked out over the front street and being as exhausted as we were, the commotion nightly from the main street didn't phase us. It wasn't bad at all.

We stayed both nights at this hotel. This was our first trip to Italy and we were being economical taking the train from the Termini to the port and back ~ which was fine. However, I would recommend you find a different hotel to stay-in. This hotel is a lot farther from the Termini than other reviews led me to believe. On top of that, it is at the very end of the neighborhood where most hotels are so you are walking a lot just to find one or two restaurant sor to enjoy any type of sightseeing and the area is not incredibly safe for nigh walking i.e. no late dinners out unless you take a taxi. And, if you have any luggage with you, it's just a big pain because the streets near this hotel are not made to pull rolled luggage on and I ended-up with a broken roller and ruined suitcase after walking to this hotel. Having said that, after we passed many other hotels we could have and should have booked, we finally found our hotel - many of these other hotels were hotels I had looked at on Expedia - which were less expensive - I would recommend the Venetia Palace as it is very, very close to the Termini and we walked past it many times wishing we had stayed there. So, we get to the hotel itself is not so great either - carpets are old and the staff didn't seem friendly pretty much ever. The elevators did not work while we were there - both times - and apparently, the elevator down or up to the 2nd floor NEVER works so you have to always carry your luggage up or down one big winding staircase, no matter what - not good for us since we overpacked for our cruise. Also, my husband smokes so we reserved a smoking room and upon check-in they said they had no record (Expedia has done this to us before so I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't true). Regardless, we had to have a non-smoking room which made the hubby very unhappy. On the way back, we did get a smoking room. As for the room itself - it's more than adequate - very, very clean - nice bathrooms - both very important to me - I don't like \"old\" places and our room seemed very modern. TV worked fine - there was CNN so hubby was happy. The outlets are all European and I had forgot a converter so they said they would hold \"one of them\" for me upon return - when we returned the next desk clerk said \"it is already out with someone\" so apparently, they only had one converter ~ so, no flat iron or Internet usage for me both stays. Which reminds me, they advertise wireless Internet but because I was never able to get a converter to plug-in our laptop, I have no clue if they have it available in the rooms - there is a small desk by the front entry with a computer but there is a sign by it saying \"you must register with the front desk to use, blah blah blah\" Breakfast at the restaurant was the best thing the hotel did - a big display of hot foods, cold cereals, juices, coffee, danishes, fruits, to-go foods, etc. Very nice and all free. As for the location, past the walking with suitcases, I just wouldn't recommend it if you want to be in the middle of lots of restaurant choices and/or hustle and bustle. We took our time to see a lot more of Rome and felt like we stayed in the absolute wrong area. I would recommend someone stay near Vatican City or the famous shopping street in Rome - where there are lots of shopping and eating options - and pay the $6 or $7 taxi fee to take you to the Termini and back, if you must. Also, we ignorantly paid 48 Euros to have the front desk arrange us a taxi to the airport on the morning we left. They told us we would have a \"private driver/not a taxi\" and the guy shows-up in an old station wagon marked taxi, drove like a maniac, then the car literally died on the highway, but we finally made it in one piece and the guy told us 48 Euros was not enough.

This is the type of hotel we usually try to go for - comfy and clean, but not overly posh being as we spend most of the time out. We were impressed with the hotel, as although it was part of a large chain (BestWestern), it felt small enough to have an atmosphere and not too impersonal. This is probably partly due to the hotel being independantly owned and managed. This also meant that one became familliar with the (very helpful, very pleasant) staff. Generally speaking, we though that it would be difficult to find such a clean, smart hotel in Rome for the price. The train station \"Termini\" is only approx 5 - 10 minutes walk from this hotel, so if you can cope with dragging your suitcases that far then that's probably the best idea. If, like us you've got a cigarette deprived, menopausal woman in the party, you'll end up getting a taxi, like we did. General Hint: If you must get a taxi, don't ask to be taken to the hotel, give the name of the road it is on. That way the taxi driver will think you've got a vague idea of where you're going and is less likely to rip you off! Like some other reviewers, we came to the conclusion that all the taxi drivers in Rome that we had used were thieving so-and-so's, and as a result ended up hiring a car. Though the hotel doesn't have it's own car park, at extra cost it can be arranged through reception to use another car park nearby. The only real negative with the hotel is that it doesn't have a terrace or any outdoor seating, so sitting out in the evening with a glass of wine (Italian Beer that we had wasn't that good!) is out of the question. Also, the hotel didn't have a swimming pool, but very few hotels in Rome city centre do unless you're prepared to pay big money.

Our room was on the fourth floor overlooking the gardens of the convent next door. Across of the convent is the Turkish embassy. Next to the Turkish embassy is the Russian embassy, this is on Via Gaeto I believe. On the same street as the hotel but in the other direction is the British Embassy. Needless to say with these facilities nearby, it's a good neighborhood. There are always armed guards at the end of the street 24/7, The hotel has a complete American/british style breakfast with eggs, ham, bacon and all of the other usuals you expect from continental breakfast service. Perhaps the presence of the British embassy across the street plays a role in the breakfast they serve? At any rate, breakfast is also included in the price of the room. Freet internet access is available in the lobby. The art deco theme of the hotel is carried out throughout the property which creates a nice ambiance. In reviewing all of the write ups before we chose this hotel, we learned of the adult movie theatre that is just across from the hotel, to the north I believe? That did not disuade us from choosing Hotel Art Deco nor should it. I had completely forgotten about this until our third day there and we walked past it going back to the hotel. The theatre is not well marked by illuminated signage and if you don't know it's there, you won't notice it. I never noticed unsavory characters or a bad element hanging around. I am sure the armed guards at the other end of the block help in that regard :) Antonio and Gioi who work the front desk during the day bend over backwards to be helpfull.

A few complaints: the room was a bit shabby with a faint sewage smell emanating from the bathroom at times; the shower was either very warm or hot but not _really_ hot; but these were fairly minor. We had some problems getting Best Western's supposed 'price guarantee' and had to deal with various levels of customer service, but got the lowest price in the end. However, the upgrade request that we put in through the Best Western system was never transmitted to the hotel; seems like the communication between BW and the hotel mgmt. should be improved.", "Date": "January 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Russia", "Title": "\u201cSweet and sunny like Italy\u201d", "Author": "Ksusha", "ReviewID": "UR8755055", "Content": "Small, sweet and sunny hotel soaked with Italian spirit.

Pretty central to the famous sites ie 20 mins walk from the Fontana di Trevi. 30 min walk from the Colusseum. The main train station is only 5 mins walk away along with the Metro. A trip to the Vatican then the use of the Metro is recommended costing 1 euro in both direction(2 euro's return) and the station Cipro (For the Vatican museums) (If you are NOT on an organised tour of the Vatican do not take the first cue you see when climbing the steps-wrong cue...) as the walk would take about 60-80 mins from the hotel.

Got to the hotel using the Leonardo Express Train from Fiumicino to Termini (the main train station). From Termini, it's about a 10-15 minute walk. Exit from the front of Termini and walk through the piazza to the main boulevard and hang a right. You'll pass through another piazza before reaching Via Palestro (about 5 blocks down). Make a left on Via Palestro. It'll be about 2 blocks up on the left hand side. There are a number of hotels in the area, so you're bound to see many other travellers lugging suitcases down the street. Quaint hotel. Spotless room, nice art deco decor. Well kept, decent sized bathroom. Front desk staff and breakfast room staff were very accommodating. As it is with many European hotels, the elevators were painfully small; barely fitting two people comfortably, much less luggage. Breakfast was very good. Deli meats, cheeses, pastries, cereal, scrambled eggs, juices, milk and coffee. Loved the location. Hotel was surrounded by embassies, so no need to worry about security. You're away from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet main attractions are still easily accessible by subway (Metro). Castro Pretorio metro station (Line B) is a 5 minute walk. (In May 2006, it was 1 euro for a single ticket or 11 Euros for a 3 day pass.) Line B will take you to Termini and the Colosseum (2 stops after Termini). When you exit the Colosseum metro station, the Colosseum will be directly in front of you. It's a breathtaking sight. At Termini, you can connect to Metro line A to get to Trevi Fountain (Barberini metro stop), Spanish Steps (Spagna metro stop) and the Vatican (Ottaviano metro stop).

We have been to Rome several times and this is one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in. Yes it is a bit far from the Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona and the other tourist locations but this is made up for by the fact that it is a safe and quiet location. It is just across the road from the British Embassy and other Embassies are close by so the area is extremely well policed by the carabinieri. Termini station is a 15 minute walk and the metro is 5 minutes away. As of last weekend a taxi from Piazza Spagna to the hotel cost 9 euros. The street itself is very quiet even though Termini station is very close. The hotel is very attractively decorated in the deco style and is extremely clean although it is not impersonal as many chain hotels can be. The staff were all courteous, spoke fluent English and were very helpful. When we had a small problem with the bathroom plumbing it was rectified immediately. Our room was very spacious, recently refurbished and at the end of a corridoor so that there was no noise. We can highly recommend this hotel as a little oasis in bustling, noisy Rome. A handy hint for those arriving at Ciampino Airport. A return ticket for the coach to Termini station costs just 13.5 euros each. This service is run by Easyjet as well as several other airlines and tickets can be purchased at the Airport. I bumped into a couple who had been charged 80 euros from Ciampino to our hotel - the correct fare is about 40 euros.
