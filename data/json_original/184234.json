This was our first visit to this hotel, although we have been frequent visitors to other Delta Hotels. By way of full disclosure, because of those visits, we were able to use an available upgrade which moved us from the regular room we booked and paid for, to a Signature Club room on the 21st floor, with a view to Burrard Inlet. Other than the view, the room itself was fairly standard, but came with all the basics, robes, great wifi and a very comfortable bed. Other than an oddly shaped sink, there is nothing to complain about. The really great thing about the Signature Club rooms is the free breakfast in the morning and snacks in the afternoon. Breakfast was first rate, and included something hot, either pancakes or french toast in our case.

The whole idea behind it was that when hotels have unsold space, they might as well fill it up. A cheaper price is still better to the hotel than an empty room. If it were a 4 star hotel, you'd get a 4 star room and 4 star service at a reduced price. The hotel would get a reasonable amount of money for their empty room which, otherwise, they would have receive nothing. Everybody wins. Well, Delta hotels in Canada, and especially this one, have found a way around this. They call it a 4 star hotel but it's not if you book on Priceline, hotwire, or a similar service that now many websites emulate. This hotel has many floors specially reserved for these \"lower paying\" customers. The beds do not have cushy toppers or fluffy comforters. The suites are missing furniture and may only include a nightstand and two chairs in the corner of what they consider the \"living room\". The \"sofa,\" if there is one, is a smallish love seat barely big enough for two small behinds. The rooms are not 4 star. In my view what you get is a 2.5 star room. So, I complained at the front desk and was met with silly arguments like \"you wouldn't expect us to rent a penthouse for a Priceline rate.\" It was clear they had head this many times before. If it's advertized as a 4 star room, I expect a 4 star room. I complained the next day again, but this time I could find a manager and I was moved to a \"regular\" room which was much better. This proved I was correct in my assessment. But, even these regular room room were no better than the mini-suites I've seen of the roadside chains. Not a 4 star downtown hotel.

I was out after dark both nights I stayed there, although not terribly late, and felt better knowing the doors to the hotel were locked on the less safe street sides. I knew this before returning, so came through the right entrance. You also need your room key to access the elevator for safety reasons too. I did not feel nearly as \"unsafe\" as i thought I would, as a woman, which was great. The rooms weren't huge, but given it's downtown Vancouver, they were bigger than I expected. I found it a bit hard to find optimal room temperature but I managed to get myself more than comfortable to sleep both nights. You can also open your window a bit, which is great for a bit of fresh air with the dry heat of a hotel room in the winter.

The location can't be beat - Waterfront station (with Canada Line public transportation to airport) is steps away, Pacific Centre (for shopping) is nearby, as are multiple restaurants. Staff assisted us with restaurant recommendations and efficiently addressed any issues related to our group booking. My only small beef with the hotel is that I wish the internet was free (internet was $17 per day). The hotel did have an offer during our stay where you could move to an upgraded (higher floor) room that included internet for $15 per day. However, not everyone in our group was made aware of this at check-in. It would just be easier and so much more welcoming if internet was free at Delta and other chains that are holding out on this feature. Nonetheless, I had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Annapolis, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cThe Delta never dissapoints!\u201d", "Author": "hernameislola", "ReviewID": "UR122374349", "Content": "We always stay at the Delta for the convienent location downtown.

It was for a two room suite with one bed and a sleeper sofa. At check-in we asked about the possibility of upgrading to a suite with two beds and were quoted a rate of $40 in addition to what had been pre-paid. The girl that was checking us in then asked how many people would be staying in the room and we said there were four of us. With that she said there would be an additional $30 charge each for persons three and four. Our first conclusion was this was a blatant opportunity to get more money for what had been a priceline rate. Aside from that, an issue in itself, we made the point that we had called after making the priceline purchase and were told four people would be allowed in the room. To that, the receptionist asked, \"did you call the hotel directly or the general reservations number?\" We don't know which it was and really it just seemed like she was using the standard response to diffuse the point we were making. After initially making it clear the hotel would stand firm on these additional charges, the receptionist relented and offered that if we paid for the $40 upgraded room, she would only charge for one extra person, $30. This would be $70 in addition to our pre-paid rate. Honestly, we travel often and frequently find priceline deals in places ranging from Vancouver, a number of US cities and also in Paris and Barcelona and have never encountered these surprise charges and inflexible staff at check-in. With the negotiations settled, she advised that the room was not yet ready for us. This was a surprise considering it was 3:15pm. So we sat in the lobby for a few minutes to decide where to go to kill some time until we could get in the room. After 5 minutes, the receptionist came over, indicated the room was now ready and gave us the keys. Now headed to the room, I reflected on the ordeal and also took note that the lobby furniture and carpet appeared worn and lightly soiled. I was hoping the room would have a better appearance. All four of us were pleasantly surprised when we arrived in our 17th floor the room and found it to be clean, well maintained, comfortable and modern. Its unfortunate we had the challenges and up charges at check-in but overall it was a good stay in a comfortable room. Much to our surpass, when we closed out our bill when leaving, the total extra charge was $40.

The living room part was well equipped with a couch, coffee table, comfy chair, desk and good office chair, and a cabinet housing the TV, fridge, etc. The bedroom had two extremely comfortable beds, flat screen TV and a dresser. There are two closets, which again is convenient. The bathroom is well lit and well equipped as well, and the spacious entry hall made moving around simple.

The hotel itself is in a good, central location (5 min walk to Gas Town, Canada Place, etc), but it's the service you receive that really sets this hotel apart from others. The outstanding service started when making my reservation. It was a bit of a complicated process, since I was redeeming my points to cover the stay. Coco in reservations was sooooo patient with me, and was a great help making sure everything was done properly. When we arrived at the hotel (two months after the reservation) who just happened to be walking by - Coco! We were greeted at the front desk by an extremely outgoing and friendly woman, who greeted each of my kids (all four of them) individually. She then gave each child a 'care package' filled with toys and cards for them - they LOVED it! Of course, next thing you know she's pulling out cookies for the kids and for the grown-ups too. We stayed on the 20th floor which is on the Signature suites level. Our suite was two rooms (separated by pocket doors) and a full bath. There was plenty of room for all of us, and the hotel made sure to send up extra towels, shampoo etc b/c they knew that there were six of us in the room. The room itself was very clean and well laid out - I even felt that it was clean enough to give my kids a bath in the tub (a rarity in hotel bathrooms!). With our suite came complimentary breakfast in the club lounge on the 20th floor. The breakfast was good, but again, it was the service which was outstanding. Sushila (who worked in the lounge) took fantastic care of us, and always made sure we had everything we needed. Again, I can't say enough about the staff and service at this hotel.

The suite was lovely with views of beautiful vancouver harbour front and Robson Street. The suite was spacious and very well maintained, the decor was modern and fresh looking and very welcoming. The lobby of the property is lovely, the Concierge level had orduerves each evening and breakfast in the am inclusive which, saved us money and was located on a high floor (22nd) with lovely views. There was the biggest seagul I have ever seen in my life hanging each morning on the side of the patio to great us on the concierge floor which, was funny (I included a pic). The service at the Front Desk was amazing, the young lady that checked us in got our a map and circled everywhere she recommend we go experience and tourist traps that are rather a waste of our time. We took her up on every suggestion and were not disappointed in the least. Capilano Suspension Bridge, the Vancouver Aquarium, Stanley Park, Granville Island, whale watching adventures from Steveton (drove us all the way to Victoria on a search for the best photo ops), Rogue resteraunt a 2 minute walk from the hotel (get the lobster mac and cheese, amazing!), Robson Street, Yaletown, etc. She also recommended a resteraunt which we really enjoyed at Granville Island along with the market there. We were recommended by a Front Desk agent the night after a hoity toity resteraunt on the Harbour Front called Aqua which, had great views but not so great service or food and was very expensive. The Front Desk gentleman that sent us there did have an appitizer sent to us compliments of him but I wouldn't return to the resteraunt. If we pay $250.00+ we expect amazing food, great service and great atmosphere. The hotel didn't have a pool or jacuzzi which, would have been icing on the cake but it was lovely none the less and the service, service efforts were wonderful. The last night we were there we ate in the lounge area and although the server wasn't very hospitable the food was amazing and made up for it. When checking out our final day we had a few hours to kill before our departure and the Front Desk stored our luggage which, was appreciated. We did not have a vehicle rental or vehicle when staying at this property but we really didn't need one seeing as the location was great, many tours we booked had hotel pick-up and the light rail transit system was one block from the hotel. We took the LRT to and from the airport with ease and costing about $16.00 there and return, much less than a taxi and the views we seen along the route were lovely.

We had been in transit for more than 40 hours and were beyond good manners and friendliness. We wanted sleep, shower and silence. The receptionist took one look at us and changed our booking to accommodate our frazzled state. From the first moment we staggered up to the reception desk, to our last minute there, the staff at the hotel were fantastic. Not in a fawning, irritating way, but in an intelligent way which showed that, no matter what they did, they did it with care and pride and were really interested in the guests. The suite was pristine and stayed so every day. When we took the tissue box out of the bathroom because we had the sniffles, the next morning we found there was an additional box on our bedside. When we asked the concierge for directions to a restaurant, he advised us and pointed us in the right direction. A few blocks later, he came running up behind us, just to make sure we were not lost! When we ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant (where the food, newspapers and magazines were excellent) we listened to the relaxed, cheerful chat of the staff amongst themselves. Sometimes they would come over and introduce themselves, ask how we are doing, and recommend a restaurant, happening or transit route. The night concierge even got on a ladder to help me photograph the impressive paintings in the hotel foyer. Wherever we went, there was always someone giving us a smile and a greeting. I don't know if that is the norm in Vancouver, or whether it is typical of Canadians, but the staff were definitely outgoing and empathetic. After the aggression and tension of Johannesburg, this was amazingly refreshing. The hotel has great free wi-fi and is situated in the centre of the Vancouver business district. You can quickly walk to many of the sights, beaches and hot spots. Just outside the entrance is a handy little shop that stocks most of the things you usually forget to pack. The view from our room was great and we spent some time just looking at the sunsets over the harbour. We slept like logs because the room seemed sound-proof.

We enjoyed cycling round Stanley Park and even did a bit of a city tour,feeling mildly smug as we passed cars stuck at the roadworks. We also found our way easily on foot to Granville Island, an interesting spot and the starting point for a great day out with Wild Whales looking for orcas! The only downside to our stay was the feel of some of the surrounding area... it would be worth taking advice from the very helpful concierge about where to go to eat in the evening, and where to avoid. We are accustomed to just wandering out and walking around till we see somewhere that looks interesting, but that approach left us feeling a bit uneasy once or twice.

While I have no complaint about the bed and the room cleanliness (which is why people first choose a hotel),,, the customer service has not been ideal and listening and offering customer service. Our complaint was with the BREAKFAST - not only was the food terrible, the service was SLOW. The way our complaint was handled - my thought is now \"why bother?\" We waited well over 30 minutes for a BLT and Scrambled Eggs on toast. The restaurant only had 4 tables (including ours) so how could they have handled a full restaurant - I believe it had 30+ tables? I could have shown the chef how to make it as it was terrible. When we commented we were given a card and directed to log in and complain... and make our comments known??? We did and alas 4 weeks later here's their comments: Thank you for completing the Delta survey in regards to your stay and particularly in regards to your breakfast experience in Manhattan restaurant.

The room ( on the 10th floor ) was much bigger than expected, was pristine and has two double beds and 2 TV's - what more could you need for a city break ?

Overall, we don't feel that the room was worth what we paid and probably wouldn't stay again if this is the best that this hotel has to offer. As a side note, for those who have complained about the location, be aware that while Vancouver is generally a very safe city, just like every city, there are areas to avoid. It is well-known to locals and frequent visitors that the part of East Hastings close to Chinatown is one of those areas. If you turn right when you walk outside the doors of the hotel and keep walking, you will quickly hit this part of Hastings. If you must head in this direction, it's best to walk up to Pender (or down to Water if you're headed to Gastown) instead, or better yet, turn left instead, walk up Seymour a block or two, and catch SkyTrain to your destination.

And, just as then, the hotel was flawlessly good with its service, amenity and all-round comfort. I am (as my othe reviews will show) reasonably generous to hotels; but the Delta is, quite genuinely, the most impressive I have stayed at in the past 5-10 years. The only one that comes close is the Marriott in Hong Kong in the 1990s: and thatt was as much because it is 'spectacular' and I was a relative newcomer to luxury hotels. Above all else, the Delta has great staff: Delta, I think, has a real focus on staff quality and it shows in the attention to detail and general demeanour. But this is not just an act - they are genuinely friendly people who should be treated as equals and will reward you for it. Indeed, I sometimes wonder whether the occasional criticisms of hotel staff you read here are produced by the mean-spirited arrogance of some hotel guests who imagine that the staff are some kind of 18th century throwback? Anyway, Delta is perfect in this regard. I think what the Delta does right is provide slightly better quality things without massively inflating the price. So, the bathroom amenities are good quality and include all that you would need (two or three kinds of soap, shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, moisturiser, and mouth wash!), rather than - as is increasingly common at some hotels - the bare necessities. There's a profusion of towels, too, all of excellent quality (again, some expensive hotels will provide just enough). Water is provided free of charge, at least 1 bottle a day; turn down service; chocolates; cookie on arrival. What this approach does is say 'hey, we are going to charge you quite a lot for this room, but we will try extra-hard to match EVERYTHING we do (not just the room itself) to the price'. I find this, implicitly, the best way to make a guest feel welcome, and, at the same time, make their stay as easy as possible. We were staying in one of the more expensive upper-floor rooms (deluxe corner view ... well worth it for floor-to-ceiling windows, two rooms) but imagine it is the same throughout. Plenty of space, as you'd expect from a suite. YMMV in a smaller room, but I suspect that the quality is the same throughout, just not the space. Decor in the Delta rooms is, at least to me, very tasteful and restrained - light greens, blond woods, bone/tan colours on the walls and fittings. It doesn't feel like it's been decked out according to some standard playbook for international hotels: e.g. the artwork is actually nice, not just there because there has to be something on the walls. So, all in all, another great stay - definitely recommended. Note - curiously, the toilet got blocked on this occasion as it did on the first stay 4 years ago! These things happen - but what makes me like Delta is the efficient, no fuss way in which the problem was solved.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFaboulous friendly service\u201d", "Author": "255103John_elphick", "ReviewID": "UR66282726", "Content": "This hotel is very conveniently located.

If you're on a business trip, you can call it a suite, because the rest area is big enough to work and meet someone. The second room was simpler, the LCD TV is in the centre to separate the sleeping and living area, but you can turn the TV 270 degrees. The only problem is all the room is facing north, where the people in the elevator to the UFO building (don't know the exact name) would see you if you don't cover yourself. Underground parking can also be accessed from the third floor of the Hotel using your card. One reminder is if you drive, you should go through the entrance on the Seymour Street, not their official address on West Hastings. We'll definitely go back there in the future if we can get a good price.", "Date": "September 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ottawa", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "MartheOttawa", "ReviewID": "UR40200199", "Content": "This is a wonderful hotel, the service was incredible.

The rooms themselves are quite nice with a relatively good size and feature a separate living and sleeping area. The bed is quite comfortable and the washroom is also of a decent size. Some of the rooms on higher floors have decent views but with all the tall buildings in this area, it is hard to have an unobstructed view. Although I did not use the gym during my recent stay, the hotel featured a gym with an adequate array of aerobic and weight equipment. The only drawback was to get to the fitness facility which is located in an adjacent building (do not have to go outside). As with most other Delta Hotels, this location features a Signature Club Lounge located on the 21st floor. A nice feature of the lounge is the balcony area with a few chairs and table providing a good view (but not necessarily picture perfect) of Vancouver. The food offering (for breakfast) is quite standard with juices, fruits, pastries, cold cuts, cereals and hard boiled eggs. Like some other Delta location in BC, the restaurant does not feature a traditional full hot buffet for breakfast (It does have a generous continental breakfast area though). Members of the Delta Privilege program who are entitled to free breakfast are usually entitled to what is called the \"American Breakfast\" (Eggs, side of meat, potatoes, toasts) or something of equivalent value.

There is a TV in both the sitting area and the sleeping area. Security is good, you need a room key to use the lifts to the floors above ground, and the streetside doors are locked at 8pm so you need to use your key after that time. That makes you feel pretty safe, as there are quite a lot of homeless panhandlers in Vancouver. The only small negative was that my wife was dismayed to see that this hotel places its coffee machines in the bathroom right next to the toilet. Probably not the most hygeinic place to make a drink! We cleaned ours and moved it onto the desk in the sitting area. No big deal really. All in all, it's a good, reliable, clean hotel which is an ideal base for which to step out and explore this fine city. If you are looking for something ultra luxurious, then look elsewhere, but if you want a good deal on straightforward rooms, then I'd definately reccomend the Delta.", "Date": "January 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGreat service, great price, great location\u201d", "Author": "AReasonableTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR23173902", "Content": "This was our second time staying at this hotel.

Hotel - Great location, across the street from the Vancouver lookout, one block from the sky train/sea bus station and on, or one block away from, key bus routes for tourist attractions. Tim Horton's 1/2 block, Starbucks across the street :) The lobby is clean and simple. My only wish is that it had a swimming pool and wireless internet in the rooms! The kids got toy packs that instantly kept them entertained for a bit while we unpacked (well, they did get into trouble with the slinkies :)). Everyone loved the warm chocolate chip cookies, too! Hotel room - Very nice updated rooms. Clean, good quality textiles. Great options in the mini-bar. We did switch from the smallish queen bed to a room with a king. They were incredibly accomodating with this request in that they personally delivered the new keys, offered to help move us and didn't charge us an extra for the bigger room. Internet access was fast and reliable. Would be nice to see at least the living space TV updated and some HD channels made available in the lower end rooms. Safety - Good - feel totally safe on this block, and also because you must have a room key to access any floors. Also, we had left some incredibly important documents behind in the safe with our room switch and everything was returned to us in perfect order. Family travel - The kids felt welcome with all of the treats, but also missed having a pool and weren't thrilled with the prospect of the twin-pullout and couch cushions for sleeping arrangements. Other - Room service was very friendly, quick and the food was good and at reasonable prices (for room service). Value - At trip time this room was priced around $15-20 less per night than other hotels when we stayed but I think it was far less when we booked (~$25-75 cheaper per night).

We were not disappointed. The property is modern and in a very good condition in terms of decor, maintenance etc. Whether you would describe our room as a suite would depend on what you expect a suite to be. We are not aware that we were upgraded but we got a very nice 'suite' on the 8th floor which comprised a spacious bedroom with two of the four walls being full height windows. Through a sliding glass door was a second equally spacious lounge/workspace. GIven that we were looking for comfortable, quality well located accomodation from which to explore Vancouver, we were more than satisfied. The staff were polite efficient and helpful. We took breakfast each morning in the hotel restaurant and found it to be excellent. We felt that detrimental references in previous reviews to the presence of 'down and out's and to the neighbourhood in which the hotel is located were hugely exagerated and the reader should not be detered from selecting this hotel by these reviews. The hotel's location is absolutely fine - no problem at all, in fact it is ideally situated to explore Gastown and Downtown. On our first night we asked the concierge if there were any areas we should NOT stray in to. There was, but with a very ample buffer between it and the hotel it was not a problem and we felt entirely comfortable walking out at night. As in any major city there are homeless and beggers and Vancouver has no more than its fair share. If your choice is to ignore them they won't, in our experience, bother you. For dinner we highly recommend Water Street Cafe in Gastown. Vancouver is a fantastic city to visit. We recommend a 'hop on, hop off' bus tour. Be sure you hop off at Granville Island as this is in the 'must not miss' category. While you are there, buy lunch from the Public Market and take it to a waterfront seat and enjoy the view and the food. Spend time at Canada Place (the cruise ship terminal) and stroll down the waterfront towards Stanley Park. Be sure also to visit Grouse Mountain and take the gondola to the top.

It is a very modern all suites hotel that even has a 13th floor (where we stayed). It's about 3~4 blocks down from the \"main drag\" and all the central shopping and entertainment. Everything was as advertised--spacious suite type room. Business desk, large bathroom, 2 comfortable double beds. All furniture was quite new and the room was decorated in bright, modern colours. My only \"complaint\" about this room, and it is minor, is that the sitting area did not have a sofa and coffee table. My room had 2 smallish chairs beside the business desk and chair. This was a small disappointment, but definitely not a problem for me. The hotel offers valet parking at a fee $25.00 and there is a self-parking parkade ($15.00/day). However, the parkade and the hotel are NOT connected by elevator, making it cumbersome to drag suitcases and shopping bags from the car to the hotel. Furthermore, to enter the parkade on foot from the hotel, you need to walk through the same entrance as where the cars drive--again cumbersome if you have a lot of luggage. The Manhattan restaurant inside the hotel had some wonderful and interesting breakfast dishes. Although it was expensive, it was different and in my eyes, worth the money. For those not familiar with Vancouver, for most activities it is best to walk up the street (away from the water) from the hotel and to stay to the west side of Hastings St. If you walk a mere 3 blocks to the east, you will see the down and out side of Vancouver. There are a great deal of homeless people and with that also comes drugs/alcoholism and petty crimes. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

The Suites are horribley small, and are not true suites. Regular Rooms are simply one room with a cheap partion, with an area that has an ottoman chair. We complained and paid 30 bucks to upgrade to a 'premium' Suite, which was still not a standard hotel suite, again a room with a partion that was broken and didn't close all the way, and left two feet gap between the cieling and and again a cheap thin partition. Amazing these guys call themselves a Suites hotel. Maybe they should go and at least look at a hotel like any Embassy Suites (which are far far superior), or for that matter the Pacific Palisades Suites in Vancouver itself. I was amazed that an earlier posting someone wrote that the Fairmont Group owns the Delta chain, what a stain on their reputation for running such a dump as this hotel, two years ago we stayed at there Hotel Vancouver and Empress in Victoria, I wish the could bring the same high standards to their Delta subsidary). We usually stay at the Palisades (part of the superior Kimpton Group) which has huge full suties and a lovely pool area. The Delta's Pool requires a huge hike to get to, where you find a filthy pool and spa, both with thick black growths of mold growthing on them. The Delta seems to think mold is in fashion or something. Our bathroom and tub and bathroom tileing had disgusting growths of black mold. The Delta has a placard in there bathrooms saying that they guarentee clean rooms, or your first night is free. This is a claim they do not honor and is silly for them to have anyways. Why dont they act like there compitiion and just offer a clean room each and everytime as a matter of professionalism and normal cleanlyness in the hospitaltiy industry. As a owner of several apartment complex's in California, the health department here would never let a property open their pool area with the gross mold they have growing everywhere. Avoid the gym as well, or you are likely to leave with a staph infection or catch some other virus. We returned in the evening to our room having found the maid, who again failed to clean the mold and dust in our room had turned the Air Conditioning on FREEZEING, at least she left a a mint by the pillow, a Claritin for alleriges would have been more appropriate for those allerigic to mold and dust. Upon going to bed I turned up the heat since the room was so cold. A couple hours later the room was still freezing so I turned on it top heat. The heater alas was broken and needed serviceing and 3 A.M. in the morning I had to call the hotels maintaince department to fix the heat in our room. After waiting close to an hour the maintaince man finally came, another hour for him to fix it. He told me this happened 'all the time' after the A/C had been on, that since they recylce the air, the heater gets full of water and has to be drained. I had enough, I went to the hotel's \"business center' to reserve a Suite at the Palisades (for a cheaper price and superior product). By the way, the 'business center' had three computers, but only one worked. It made me wonder if anything worked in this property. Luckly the Palisades had room for our next three nights we where spending in town. What a relieve to be able to get out of this property . Amazingly upon checking out we found the check-out staff aincredibly unproffessional and rude. It was if the women who checked us out named 'Chi-Chi' was experienceing her first day at work or maybe was sent from a Temp Agency to fill in for the day. Though she had a record of filthy room we got, she knew of the mold in their pool, -as she informed us they share it with the condo complex next door, and the hotel was 'pondering' closing \"their\" pool as the condo complex regularly leaves in uncleaned with mold and bacteria and who knows what. We informed her that if their own hotel cleaning staff was incapable of cleaning the mold in around the batthtubs in the room, the pool would still be the same. Anyways Chi-Chi, said there was nothing she could do as we had booked our room through Hello-B.C. , which is part of the province's Tourism department, and thus could not honor their policy gurarentee of a clean room or hotel facilities, but she was happy to throw in her totally rude and unprofessional service for free! I have written to Delta's \"we listen\" customer service department but have recieved no reply so far and it has been over six weeks now since our stay. Lastly, this is hotel is located in Vancouvers worst nieghborhood, Gastown is full of filth and drug addicts. The hotel purposely Locks its front enterance on Hastings St. for security. Thus you must enter the hotel through the garage breezeway to get into the hotel at night. Do yourself a huge favor and stay in a safer neighborhood, like in Yaletown or on or near Robsin Street, i.e. like the Pacific Palisades where your are close to shopping, restarurnats and nightlife, the dodgey neighborhood of the Delta offters none of this come the weeekend when the area is deserted.

An amazing view from all sides, excellent washroom, good location near the Waterfront Station, and friendly staff who always said \"hello\" or \"good morning\" when they passed you.

We didn't have a very good experience last time - the alarm went off at 4 am and hotel employees had no idea what to do - so I complained and management gave me a free 2-night stay. We decided to use it on 12/15-12/17 and it couldn't have been better timing since we are from the Seattle area and had no power for 3 days. The biggest plus to this place is that they allowed us to bring our boxer. The staff was super friendly to our dog and complimented on her every time we walked through the lobby. They also gave us a bag of treats. The room is pretty nice w/ a sitting area, desk, large windows and large bathroom. There is a park about a block and a half away and we also found a dog beach where she had a blast. Vancouver BC is much more pet friendlier than Seattle is. I think she had more fun than we did! One scary thing is that I got a call from my credit card company saying that the hotel tried to charge my credit card $86,000! When I talked to the front desk about it they acted like it was no big deal and that it happens all the time (when the person checking you in forgets to put a limit on the deposit). I let it slide because it didn't go through and the good things about the hotel superseded the bad. We had room service for breaksfast, which was wonderful, and had a snack in the bar at the lobby. The prices are reasonable and not too spendy (compared to Seattle). I would definitely stay here again because it's only blocks within Robson and a block away from the shopping mall so you don't really need a car.

From the start of our stay until we departed I have cannot say enough about the calibre of this hotel. The service was as good if not better than we have had in 5 + star resorts ! The front desk staff, guest services etc were second to none. Two very telling indications: While on the elevator, I had the pleasure of having one of the guest services staff join me on another floor. When I said good morning, she quickly said....room 1106 ? To which I replied yes how did you know. She indicated that she had taken my call that am and then called me by name ! The second telling event was when my family arrived back tired from the family wedding only to have one of the valet staff say....how was the wedding, you folks look great. It is this personalized attention to detail that in my mind differentiates a good hotel from an excellent hotel. The room was wonderful for us....we had a queen bed in a separate room and a pull out couch for the kids in a sitting area. We did see a room with two doubles but the sitting area is limited so I would definately suggest the room we had for family travellers. I would recommend this hotel highly. On another note stay away from the Brew-works restaurant in Whister. Bad food, long wait and it really demonstrated poor quality and service to us. The manager there needs a serious lesson in leadership and taking responsibility......when we complained after my young daughter was in tears waiting 45 mins for her food, the manager blamed just about every one of her staff .....really turned us off !!

However, he did park the car in front and behind my car without explaining to those drivers the cost of valet. I did park my own car after the attendant implied I could not afford valet service. The front desk clerk who checked me in only informed me of my room number. I had to inquire how to get to my room, and where parking was located. Since I have never been to this establishment I did not realize that I would need directions from the parking garage to my room (the clerk only gave directions from the front desk). Our room did have the aromatherapy package on our bed. The sparkling wine was not in the room. I called the front desk at 3:30 p.m. and was informed that someone would start delivering to the rooms at 3:00. I think it should have been brought to the room with the aromatherapy basket.

It was nice to see they offered more than just a cold sandwich. We got our meal in about 10 minutes and really enjoyed the quality of our late night meal (besides the fact we were famished and could of eaten anything about that time) and the price I found reasonable. We had a great sleep in the hotel's comfy bed, and were not bothered by any Monday morning traffic noise. Maybe being on the 9th floor had a little to do with that. There was a coffee machine in the room but we opted to hit the Starbucks across the street. (There's also a Tim Horton's across the street) Overall, we enjoyed our 1 night stay at this hotel.
