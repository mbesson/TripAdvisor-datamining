{"Reviews": [{"Content": "This hotel manager saved our trip! We arrived at the hotel totally dejected, since our most important piece of luggage containing wedding clothes and gifts had not turned up at the airport, and the personnel had no idea where it was. We were leaving early the next morning for another city and despaired of ever seeing it again. The hotel manager, Gijs Schelvis, telephoned, used the computer and worked literally hours until he located it, and the next morning we retrieved it at the airport. Without his help, our trip would have been a great disappointment, to say the least. He was quick, efficient and relentless in helping us. In addition the small, cozy hotel was very clean and attractive, in a quiet little town about 20 minutes from the airport with a free shuttle to and fro. The room was very small but comfortable and after all, this is Europe! I recommend it.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR101277864", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bunski"}, {"Content": "Erm... dont even bother the hotel was properly the worst place i have been to. the service was really shabby, the rooms were dated, the shower was bad, breakfast was tasteless, and the location!! absolutly miles away!! the only good thing i can say about this hotel.. the drinks were cheap at the bar and there was cheap internet access, but that about it.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR580879051", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "beniboi"}, {"Content": "Just say \"No\" I ended up \u9225\u6e1ftuck\u9225?at this location due to a soccer conference in Amsterdam that booked all the hotels- including the preferred Sheraton \u9225?airport. I am not sure \u9225\u6e22errible\u9225?rating is one hundred percent accurate in the description of this hotel, but it is definitely less than \u9225\u6e19k\u9225? The hotel is very far away from the airport and town. It\u9225\u6a9a located in a residential neighborhood and is 15 \u9225?5 minutes from the airport. The good: They offer a free pick up shuttle that runs between the airport and the hotel ( its a good thing, as I dont think taxi drivers could find it) . At least one of the shuttle drivers is friendly (not the case with the one who picked me up late in the evening). The rooms were tired, but clean.The bad: Other than one driver, the rest of the staff was considerable less than friendly. There is a restaurant and bar (the front desk personnel, tend the bar, and would prefer to chat with friends than provide service). I \u9225\u6999 recommend avoiding eating or drinking there. There are NO restuarants ( or anything else) in the area. The soap in the room includes the tiny bars similar to those provided in motor inns in the 50\u9225\u6a9a. Other than one \u9225\u6e1bay per minute\u9225?computer I saw in the bar, I saw no other evidence of internet access. The walls are thin and the hotel was very noisy. When you check-in they hand you your remote for your room TV, I don\u9225\u6a9b know why its not left in the room, but in any case it probably wont work. The lobby is the size of a small closet, and if a few people are waiting for a shuttle, there is literally no place to stand. Overall the hotel has the look an old Holiday Inn on the verge of being closed. Book early in alternative locations and avoid being stuck here. At 130.00 euro (without breakfast) you wont be happy with the location, accommodations and certainly not the staff.", "Date": "Nov 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR910166347", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "snowbiz100"}, {"Content": "Too far out This hotel was at least a 15 minute drive from the airport so the name was rather deceiving, it was just too far out of town for my liking.
