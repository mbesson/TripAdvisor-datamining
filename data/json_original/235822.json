We decided to take a water bus (alilaguna-blue line. one way price was 15euros p.p) and got off at the stop named s.zacaria and the hotel was directly infront of the stop. The hotel itself was located in a brilliant place right in the midst of san marco square. The hotel staff were nice and helpful, but the 1st mission was getting up the, what felt, never ending stairs. we were located right at the 4th floor with a lagoon view. now, the lagoon view was paid extra, but frankly, we could of got the same view through normal windows. the bed was cosy but the room itself was a little cramped. the 2nd mission was to find a reasonable place to eat, after reading about the high prices of dining in venice. the 1st night, we ate at the hotel, and i have never been appalled with how little food we received at such a high price, and it wasn't exactly fancy (four pieces of ravioli cost 15euros, 330ml of water was 6euros). i would recommend to go to a supermarket, or a small grocery shop to buy small bits like water and drinks etc. The views were brilliant and would highly recommend a gondola tour (80 euros). Whilst our time there, we managed to find a little restaurant named Antica Sacrestia venizia which did 3 course meals for 20euros. regarding shopping, everything is pricey, but at the markets, you may have a chance to haggle. the further away from san marco, the cheaper everything is. on the last day, we took a water taxi back to the airport which took around 25mins and cost 100euros. All in all, was a great experience, but i personally think i will not be returning just because of the dear prices and just for the experience we had.

It is in front of the Zaccaria stop. Sorry if I misled anyone. We chose this hotel because of the great reviews and location. Thanks to all that take the time to write so that the rest of us can learn from your experiences. And now I can return the favor by telling you how much we enjoyed our stay in Venice and at the Wildner. Before coming here, I researched the best hotels and enotecas that offered cheap prices. I printed out maps and directions from the vaporetti stops. I bought two 48 hour vaporetti tickets online for 27 euros each ( A 60 minute one way ride is 6,50 euro). The vaporetti are a must for getting around in Venice. Walking is fine and is the only way to see the wonders of the back streets and small canals, but the vaporetti can take you anywhere in Venice far or near with a million dollar view. A pass can pay for itself in just a few hours of site-seeing. We were there for two days prior to a Mediterranean cruise and must have rode the vaporetti from here and there a couple of dozen times. The Zaccaria stop is right in front of the hotel Wildner. The Alilaguna also stops there. The Alilaguna is the best way to get to the hotel or straight to the cruise terminal from the airport or vice versa (the vaporetti do not go to the airport). I bought one way Alilaguna tickets on line as well before we left so we could go directly from the baggage claim, get a baggage cart and go for a reasonably short walk to the Alilaguna station. We boarded the boat with all our luggage and just sat back and enjoyed the beautiful view as we saw Venice for the first time. It seemed like a short trip, but I had read that it takes more than and hour to get to our stop (we didn't keep track of the time, the boat ride was so much fun). When we got off, we saw our hotel and just rolled our luggage a short walk and checked in. The Hotel was charming. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay the extra price for a lagoon view, but our second floor room did have a window with an interesting view of an alley and some rooftops. It was typically small, but economically spaced and extremely clean and quiet. I even took a picture of the wall paper and headboard . I would not say it was dated at all as has been previously described in some reviews, but rather in good Venetian taste. A free breakfast buffet was served in the canopied restaurant at the front of the hotel. It was a perfect setting on the alluring Riva Degli Schiavori as passers by were as interesting to watch as the scenery itself. Although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have dinner at the hotel restaurant, whenever we went by it was always full of people while other restaurants nearby scarcely had anyone. We chose to eat at enotecas or wine bars as it is a lot cheaper and we are light eaters. Besides which, we were going to be on a cruise for 31 days and have gourmet meals every night. The enotecas I researched turned out wonderful. We went back to a couple twice. One thing I will tell you is to read the prices on the menus. There are usually two prices for the same thing, one for if you want a table, and a cheaper one if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind standing. The locals always stand and pay half as much as the tired tourist. Some of the ones we went to offered free seating, excellent food, and cheap prices thanks to the reviews I researched. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to Venice for the first time, the Wildner hotel is as convenient at it gets, and lives up to it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good reviews. We went in August 2011, and the weather while hot when standing in lines out of the shade, was pleasant most everywhere else. The air-conditioning in our room was just fine. In fact, we had the window open in the mornings after we got up and did not see one mosquito. Elevators in hotels do not make for a good hotel. In a lot of other places we have stayed with elevators, upon arrival they always insisted on taking our luggage to the room anyway. So it cost you a couple of euros for a tip, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small price to pay for a Hotel that offers so much in other ways for such reasonable prices. If walking up and down stairs is a problem, then of course this is not the hotel for you, but then neither is Venice the city for you. We requested a room on the second floor with a window, and that is what we got (some hotels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have a window in all their rooms). As far as the hotel operators being aloof, that was an issue at the very bottom of my want list. The same applies to restaurants and wine bars. If you want to go where the locals go (off the beaten track) for the best food and drink choices, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect too much attention if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak any Italian. If you do speak a little Italian it can be a wonderful experience communicating with them. They want to help you, but they need to understand you first.

The views are amazing across the lagoon and you see the cruise ships coming in and out and there is always activity outside to look at. The reception area is tiny and staff could be a bit more welcoming as mentioned in other reviews. We booked a room for a family of four on the top floor with the lagoon view. The view is absolutely fantastic although the room was quite small. With four suitcases, 2 adults and 2 teens it was a bit squeezy and the furnishings a little tired although clean as well as the bathroom being clean and modern. The staff help with your suitcases up the narrow staircase to the top floor. This floor is best as it avoids any noise from other rooms or floors above you.

The wifi connection was not great with it dropping in and out constantly which was frustrating but found very early in the morning the connection was better.

No the hotel does not have a lift but the staff will take your bags up for you if you would like them too, we took our bags up to our room ourselves and did not find it a problem at all.

The breakfast at the hotel is self service continental with a choice of cereal's, meats & cheese, bread rolls, french bread, croissants, fresh fruit and yogurts, coffee/tea and orange juice, we had a meal at the Hotel one evening and the food was excellent but fairly expensive, bear in mind that you do get 10% off your bill if you are staying at the Hotel, as an example.. we paid 91 Euros for.. One starter to share, 2 main meals, one dessert to share, a bottle of Rose wine and a glass of brandy!!

It proved to be a great strategy, although I wouldn't say that the Hotel Wildner was necessarily one of the best hotels to stay at in Venice. First the positives: 1) Our room did not overlook the Grand Canal. but the breakfast area did, so that in and of itself was worth the stay, since we looked out on the Maria della Salute and Maria Maggiore churches every morning. 2) The staff was incredibly thoughtful. We told them we were leaving the next morning at 6:15, and they had a cup of coffee and breakfast ready to go for us, even though breakfast service didn't begin until 7:00. 3) There was plenty to choose from at breakfast, and the fruit was cut by someone at the restaurant rather than bought pre-cut and packed in a jar or plastic container The potential down sides: 1) Our room was three flights up. Not a deal breaker, but the stairway is very narrow, which made it awkward. 2). Our room was not minuscule, but there wasn't a lot of extra room either. 3) While the room was in very good condition and not shabby in the least, it seemed a little claustrophobic.

The location is superb. Could not ask for more in this respect. It is situated in the middle of two public boat stops. We took a private taxi from Piazzale Roma and I would recommend it to anybody. Its quite an experience. The Wildner wasn't our first choice. Unfortunately, there was a huge medical convention being held in Venice on the same weekend and there wasn't a room available on the entire island. We were lucky to have gotten a room at the Wildner. The first night we were in Room 41 - smaller and not facing the lagoon. We paid 180 euro for this room. The next day Elisabetta (Manager, very helpful and friendly) agreed to move us to a Lagoon-facing room with 3 large windows. This room cost us 220 euro. The Wildner has a slightly tired look about it - inside and out. Although it is very clean, it gives the impression of being old and out-dated. It is a 3* hotel at best. We climbed up to the 4th floor (yes, thats 8 flights of stairs). There is no elevator and they have strategically placed a poor, old man at the front desk so that you are on your own in terms of carrrying your own luggage. The room we had for the first night was very small and very gloomy. The room is adorned in typical kitschy decor. The washroom, albeit clean, was fairly small. When the hotel says its a double bed, don't bet on it. Ask them. Our room had two single beds put together to form a double bed. It was rather uncomfortable. The A/C barely worked. But to be fair it wasn't needed. The room for the 2nd night was much better. It was very, very large for venice standards. We had 3 large windows opening up to a lagoon view. The view truly is wonderful. You can hear the gondolas sloshing in the water and tourists streaming by on the walkway below. However, at night if you close your shutters, you can't hear a peep. The room had a sitting area on one end and a large cupboard next to the bed. There is wooden flooring through out. The washroom is also larger here. The bed, however, was still quite uncomfortable. The breakfast is included in the price of the room. The breakfast room is rather pleasant. The food is not. There is ust some cereal, milk, juice, yoghurt, cheese and fruit (read apples only). We would have like something warm, not even eggs were available. I'm not quite certain why some people have left really positive reviews for this hotel. There is no touch of quality or luxury visible here. We saw 2 different room configurations. One was their top-floor suite. I would expect a lot more for this price. But alas this is Venice. I would recommend that you do shop around. There are many more better deals to be had at this price. Remember, if you would like a lagoon view for a fraction of what the Danielli would charge you then the Wildner is a pretty good deal. Although there are other hotels on this strip that would provide you with a little more quality. The one redeeming feature, however, was the service of one or two individuals. The 2 gentleman at the front desk were very helpful indeed. On our last day, we were late for our flight, one of them rushed into the kitchen and packed us some light sandwiches and drinks for the trip. Free of charge. Would we stay here again? Not really, and not because we had a terrible experience. All in all, we had a wonderful trip. And we didn't spend too much time in the rooms anyway. But there IS a lot of choice on the island. Spend some time to look around.", "Date": "October 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMagical Venice Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Calgarymember", "ReviewID": "UR4001998", "Content": "Early in September, my wife and I stayed 5 nights in a lagoon view room at the Hotel Wildner. Our room was very clean, well air-conditioned, had a room safe and what a terrific view (see photos taken from room windows). The Wildner's location could not be better. We walked everywhere in Venice and ended every night at St Mark's Square basking in the music of the duelling quartets. At night's end, we had a very pleasant, short walk back to the Wildner. There was never a dull moment on San Marco Basin in front of the Wildner but yet the windows were very sound-proof when shut. Every day began with a leisurely breakfast on the covered patio fronting onto the promenade and the Basin. The patio has glass enclosures that can be moved into place in case of inclement weather (not required during our stay). The staff were all helpful and very friendly. We previously visited Venice in 2003, staying in an excellent hotel, but would consider staying only at the Wildner on our next visit. The lagoon view room is definitely worth the premium.", "Date": "October 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "2", "Value": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cNot sure what all the fuss is about\u201d", "Author": "SThearia", "ReviewID": "UR3786075", "Content": "We booked (triple room 180 EUR per night) for four nights but checked out after only one, and really can't see why others rave about this hotel. Come on people! Surely it has seen better days and needs a makeover so that it doesn't look so shabby. Yes, it's a pensione, but that's no excuse for the generally poor standard of decoration (inside and out - not exactly inspiring when you see that your hotel is the only building on the water's edge that has a cladding of old grey plaster and nothing else). Our room had dust on the some furniture, unrepaired water damage (marks etc) in the bathroom and a door that had a gap between it and the door frame. Have to admit that the view is pretty nice, but for exactly what percentage of your time are you going to just stand at your hotel window and look out? We quickly found a recently refurbished two bedroom apartment about 1 minute's walk from the same water's edge, at 10 EUR per night less. In case you're wondering, we aren't new to Italy in terms of a holiday destination so this review is a measured one as far as we're concerned. A parallel can be drawn between this hotel and Venice itself - despite the tourist income, there wasn't any evidence of it being reinvested for the benefit of tourists. Got to 'do' Venice once in your life, I guess, but we can't see ourselves going back.", "Date": "August 18, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Wildner", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d235822-Reviews-Hotel_Wildner-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$106 - $342*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Riva degli Schiavoni 4161</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Castello</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30122</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "235822", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/05/74/05742b2aa2f88e71fd91ea8da842513432large.jpg"}}
