The beds were large and very nice to sleep on. The room I was in was situated a distance from the main lift however, it was much closer to the Club Olympus lifts - which led to the health club. I wandered up to the health club and saw there was a nice gym, changing rooms which led to a German sauna / steam room (mixed genders) at the back and a heated swimming pool and jacuzzi. I did spend a couple of mornings just soaking in the jacuzzi which was wonderful in winter! The location of this property was wonderful as it was within 10-15 minutes of the Brandenburg gate (I stayed during the New Year's Eve so it was a bonus just walking to and from the gate!) - the sound of fireworks going off late into the night didn't really bother me much. The U and S Bahns and trams and bus stations were also very close by within a 5-10 minute walk.

Since the weather in Berlin was not upto my suiting (for me winter is 15-20c.. and it was -5c at that time!), hence I was mostly stuck inside the hotel or at best within walking distance, as I had to repeatedly to return to warm myself up! While I had originally booked for a Grand King Single room, I was upgraded to a Grand King Double room at no extra cost, and that came in handy for a someone who likes to move sideways free while deep in sleep! Breakfast at Vox is healthy and hearty: the spread is the best that can be! One is simply spoiled for choice, and if you like a good, heavy breakfast (like I do!) than I would recommend a good 1 hour be set aside for this ritual. The hotel is incredibly modern, well-maintained and while modern with original artwork adorning the common areas and the rooms, it isn't all too over-bearing and it all sinks in perfectly well. I didn't try out any of the restaurants there, so I won't be able to comment much about this area. The Sony Centre next door was amazing, and everything else was also within walking distance: I did trips to the Berlin Wall museums as well as the Holocaust memorial and the Checkpoint Charlie all on foot. The reception could have been better manned, and while I did ask repeatedly for help on my walks - the guy at the concierge appeared really friendly - but his directions weren't too helpful. Also, what he directed to me was of not much interest to me. I was indeed offered a map too, but again, since I was new to the city and had shorter time at hand due to the business nature of my trip, I always found that I could have done better with some extra help from the concierge! I guess I paid about 150 euros per night, but it was worth the stay.

My son, wife and I stayed in a grand suite, which was fantastic. Two separate rooms and lots of space. Everything seemed pretty new and well kept, and the best of it all was that all drinks and snacks from the minibar, the club lounge and the wine and booze in the room was complimentary. That was really nice. What I particularly liked about this hotel was the spa on the top floor. We did not have any treatments up there, but we used the pool, the steam room and the sauna a few times, and especially the jacuzzi next to the pool was so nice to sit in and relax after a cold day in the city. Location is ok - we normally stay in hotels around Ku'damm, but Postdamer Platz has turned into a rather nice corner of the city, and the walk to Friedrichstrasse is quite short, so we were just fine with this location. We had a few issues with the hotel - first, when we arrived 1\u00bd hours after official check-in time, two of the five rooms were not ready yet. That is not ok at this level. We were compensated with a drink that turned out to take 30 mins to arrive. Not really getting any more pleased by this. One of the rooms had issues with noise from a seemingly karaoke bar one floor beneath. Both issues were compensated more than fairly on our check out bill without having to create a big scene about it, which we found was extremely good customer service. So even though we had a few issues, both were resolved caringly from the hotel's side, and we left very happy with our choice. I would recommend this hotel to anybody - also families with children even though there are not many of them at this hotel.

We paid 153 euro a night for a standard room. The hotel is about 5 minutes and 7-10 euro by taxi from the train station, which is very nice. The lobby is nice, although it has a very odd large blue square on the wood panelling when you enter, which may be artistic but I though just did not work. Check in was simple and easy enough, and the lady was very friendly. We were given a map at check in and the clerk was very friendly and made sure we knew where things were and to let her know if we had any other questions. The rooms were satisfactory. They were a decent enough size. There were not really any views to speak of. The bathroom was large enough for 2 of us to move around it, although it was a little hard to find the light switches in the night, and some of the lights they turn on are a weird choice, as some of them can awaken the other person. The shower was large and spacious, and had a rain shower with seperate tub, much like the Hyatt Regency Cologne. The TV was a flat screen with the standard assortment of international channels. We had breakfast in the club lounge every day, which was good. It was about on par with the Hyatt in Cologne and Mainz, although I would give the GH Berlin the edge. There were a few more choices in the cold meat department, and they had very very good fresh made apple juice. Also, they offered more hot egg choices for those who care, other than just hard boiled. There was a standard assortment of yogurt, breads, etc like always. The breads were very good, as they were at each hotel. In the evenings there were desserts and some light hot foods, which were nice. A little step above the other Hyatt Regency Clubs, as you could definitely eat dinner in the club if you wanted/had to. There was a little room with a computer in the club for email/internet, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel is well located, as it is very close the train station and is only about a 10-15 minute walk from the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag. You can easily walk to those sights, and you are already in the Potsdamer Platz where there are restaurants and shopping, etc. A taxi to Tegel (TXL) airport early in the morning cost us about 18 euro and took about 10-15 minutes. Only had 1 minor issue and that was a 2.5 euro charge on my bill at checkout for \"parking\" which was odd since we did not have any vehicles. They took it off without any argument and it was gone from the copy of my bill I received, although I strangely had a seperate charge for about $3.40 US when I returned home, but this was promptly removed by my credit card company. Not sure if it was that, but I can't imagine it was anything else. A very minor issue though, which was fixed easily.

The bath/shower 'sliding door' room was great...and the towels, Aveda toiletries and great lighting and mirrors. Just what a perfect bathroom should be. 2. the sleep - bed was super comfy, lots of pillows, blackout curtain and easy to operate lighting from bed...and an amazing TV too.. easy to sleep...zzzzz! 3. Spa - fantastic. I had the best massage of my life here... Steve the masseur is a sports physio and does deep tissue/shiatsu-esque... absolutely fantastic. The spa is mixed sexes and very German (e.g. everyone is nude...and wearing a bathing suit in the sauna is verboten...or, at least frowned upon. Sorry - but I am uncomfortable sitting naked with the equivalent of my parents and a few complete strangers in searing heat inches apart and thinking it is 'natural' and not unusual!) ok...back to the spa.. clean, modern, great showers and facilities...but the pool! And jacuzzi...with a great view and relaxing vibe.. post massage it was truly relaxing...along with the free Aveda tea.. Staff were super polite and courteous. Spoke perfect english and couldnt have been more helpful. The gym was small - but good equipment, but crowded between 6pm and 8pm on weekdays. 4. location, location, location - right on U/S Bahn... good shoppping next door at the Arkade and easy to walk to best sights and Tiergarten. Truly in the centre of the city and not too touristy...but lots of touristy things to do, and good restaurants at all prices. 5. MESA - a great concept... German tapas. Excellent...the beet salad and dark bread were delicious, but the goulash was fantastic! great wine choices and perfect service. Save room for the streussel! 6. Front desk staff - helpful, courteous, efficient and always seemed to be available and free...and if there was a queue, they acknowledged all guests and offered an apology promising to be 'right with you'... kudos to the management, I have NEVER had that happen before. An apology to people waiting to check in or check out... you get the feeling that this hotel is run by a top pro - and it shows! 7. the artwork in the hotel - beautiful, with a nice book explaining all about the pieces...and in the room, the nice touches of vases and books was great...I never felt it was a hotel, more like a private apartment in the middle of Berlin! my only gripes... housekeeping took all day to clean our room every day we were there... usually around 4pm...however, they did a very good job and literally wiped every surface and used the vaccum as if the carpet was fithy.. german tidiness gone mad! And gripe number two - why not free wifi in the rooms? The 3 euros per hour offered by Swiss com is highway robbery..though the first 30 mins are free... but apart from those two minor gripes... the Grand Hyatt is one of the best hotels in the world, and definately in Berlin!

I stayed here twice and both times I had asked housekeeping to have a specific item delivered to my room before my arrival. The first time, they forgot and I had to phone housekeeping twice (!) before it was finally delivered several hours later, which I found very irritating. I reported it all and the management made a note of it for my next stay. So before my next arrival, I again asked for that item by email - to be sure the note in my computer file would not be overlooked - and that email was confirmed. Guess what? The item wasn't in my room and when I called housekeeping they said they knew nothing about this. So it took another hour or so until it was finally delivered. Besides having to wait and change my plans, I found it most unpleasant that I not only lost time but also had to make phone calls about the item when I had sent an email to avoid just that kind on unrelaxed arrival! This is really not my idea of getting pampered at a 5* hotel. Mistakes happen, sure. But a hotel that can't even manage to fulfill a small wish like that two times in a row and despite there being clear instructions from management on my computer file, has a serious problem. Considering the enormous rates per room this really is bad value for money. The best thing about this hotel is the absolutely excellent restaurant Vox with its fantastic service, outstanding food and good wine.

From the moment we walked in the hotel we were impressed and thought we made the right choice regarding where to stay in Berlin. The hotel was perfectly located within walking distance to the major sites and transportation hubs. The hotel was also located near many restaurants although we spent much of our meal times at the hotel as the hotel restaurants were impressive and delicious. We had a King Club Room which meant we were on the Club Level. The Club level gave us access to the Grand Club Lounge which featured complementary: breakfast, afternoon tea, snacks, beverages & alcoholic drinks. The room itself was modern and well decorated. We also enjoyed the Aveda bath products. The only shame about this hotel was that we did not sleep well either night we were there! We had a corner room and although it was on a high floor, it was incredibly noisy! The entire night we heard people partying outside and cars speeding by revving their engines. It was awful! We asked to switch rooms (we even said we'd downgrade to a smaller, non club level room or even have 2 separate beds) but the hotel said they were all sold out and did not have a single room to move us to. They offered apologies but that was all. I was disappointed that even after another consecutive night of not being able to sleep and asking again to move rooms that the hotel only apologized again but said there was nothing they could do. I found it hard to believe they were completely sold out and I was disappointed they couldn't move us to a room of someone that hadn't checked in to yet. I wish I could say I would return to this hotel as the hotel itself was lovely however, the devil was in the details and as our lack of sleep put a damper on our enjoyment of our Berlin vacation I can only recommend the hotel if you get an interior facing room or perhaps avoid staying there during the weekends.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dusseldorf, Germany", "Title": "\u201cExcellent business hotel\u201d", "Author": "Kvitochka", "ReviewID": "UR94773014", "Content": "Grand Hyatt Berlin features great location, as well as facilities, amenities and excellent service.

There's very little wrong with it. Firstly, please note, this is geared as a business hotel and is run by a corporate chain so you won't have the personalised touches that you would from a family run hotel. Location: It's 3-5 mins walk from Potsdamer Platz on the S-Bahn and U-Bahn. Berlin is slightly too spread for most people to walk only and the train/metro(tube, subway) comes in very handy. I would recommend the 3/5/7 day tourist travelcard as it gives you a discount to tourist attractions and is only a little bit more than the usual 3/5/7 day travelcards.There's a shopping centre opposite if you find you've forgotten anything or wish to buy anything. Room: The bed is very comfortable, room spacious and bathroom is decent size with separate shower and bath. Also separate toilet cubicle, albeit within the bathroom. The things which i really liked were the little touches like; the heated floor in the bathroom, tv in the bathroom with speakers, apples in the fruit bowl, apple dock connected to the tv and aveda products in the bathroom. Spa/Swimming facilities: I didn't use the gym but the swimming pool is a really decent size for an indoor pool and has quite a nice view of the concert halls nearby. The jacuzzi is lovely, especially after a long cold day. There is also a steam room, sauna, plunge pool and relaxation area. Towels, robes, slippers and toiletries are all provided within the spa area and there is always staff around to help. I didn't eat at the restaurants which appeared to be a little dear, from what I can remember and room service which was also in line with 4/5* hotels which I also didn't try.

I get very, very little vacation time and the time I do take I have high expectations for. The Grand Hyatt Berlin not only lived up to those expectations, it surpassed them. Very few places get the full 5 stars from me in review. Only places I'd sacrifice to stay at get the highest grade. This is one of them. Location: about two blocks from the Potsdamer Banhoff and U station, in the heart of an mid-upscale shopping and hotel area (the Marriott and the Ritz Carelton are nearby). We arrived on an early morning flight which put us at the hotel at about 09:30. Our room was ready for us and they allowed us immediate access to it, which worked well for a three hour power nap. We were escorted to the room by the service oriented front desk attendant, which was a nice touch. We stayed in a Club King on the 7th floor (the highest floor with rooms). Its window looked out over the city. While a courtyard room would have been quieter, we anticipated better ventilation and coolness from an outside room. It was a spacious room with a king bed, nice flat screen TV (is there any other kind these days?), an oval desk, and night stands. The bathroom was large with a separate toilet cubicle. The bathroom floor was marble (alabaster actually, but I get technical) and was heated. The shower and tub are partitioned off by large sliding glass doors and take up an area equal or larger than many hotel room bathrooms I've been in. For those of you in the know, the soap/shampoo is Aveda. They advertise that the room windows open and they do... tilting open from the top, and even with the electrically operated light block screen most of the way down, provided good air circulation and coolness through the night. The only thing that I would want to improve about the room was the bed. It was quite firm. While by no means uncomfortable, it wasn't the best I've had either (Marriott consistently has the best upscale beds). We asked for an additional comforter and slept on that for our stay. Even that little bit made a difference. The beds need at least a minimal topper to be great. As it stands now they are merely good. Linens were very high quality and the pillows, the bane of some hotels were excellent. Security: In room safe, elevators require key card, front desk seems to monitor the elevator lobby well, and the room doors are big, thick, and heavy. Fire exits were clear and well marked (I've learned from experience that this matters). We had access to the Grand Club Lounge and used it for breakfast, afternoon cake, and evening appetizers/wine. The Club attendants were excellent, learning quickly what we liked to drink and remembering it through the week. The food was simply some of the best I've had in a hotel lounge. The afternoon cakes, apparently a German tradition, was excellent, and I am certainly not a cake person. We made an excuse to be near the hotel around \"cake time\" (3PM) every day. I wish we had done more of the gourmet evening appetizers as the ones we had were superb, but hey... you can't hang around the hotel all the time. I have attached a picture of the Club Lounge to this review. All in all, it was one of the best hotel stays I've had and certainly the best Hyatt stay.

The central location in the revitalized Potsamerplatz makes for easy travel anywhere in the city, on foot, on public transport, or by taxi; at the same time, the hotel's many facilities make it easy to combine shopping, museums, etc., with downtime in the pool, spa, or club lounge (a worthwhile upgrade). The Grand Deluxe King room was spacious, well-laid out, and greatly enhanced by the luxurious bathroom with its separate bath/shower room.

The usual fabulous Hyatt bed, of course, along with a comfortable chair, nice work area, and plenty of room for unpacking. Throughout the hotel, the design is crisp, modern, and simple, without being austere or sacrificing a sense of elegance - I thought of it as having a contemporary, subtle luxury, as opposed to a more \"olde world\" avalanche of velvet drapes and gilt.

But the best thing about the hotel was probably the location, since it was very easy to get out to see the sights of Berlin. When writing a review, I always try to look for some negatives to balance out the positives, but that was hard to do here. The only negative I can think of is the high cost for internet access. That's a cost that you're willing to accept on a business trip, but it would be much more distasteful on a holiday.

It's very close (walkable) to all the major attractions and subway access is close. The hotel is adjacent to a major mall/entertainment complex with a lot of offer. Rooms: Posh. For Europe, rather large rooms with very comfortable bedding. The bathrooms are almost as large as the room (larger than some NYC hotel rooms I have stayed in) and very spa-like. Great Aveda products and almost every amenity you would need. Staff: Very professional, very efficient, very accomodating. By all means, they get the idea of \"service\", albeit with a German style. I would say it's equivelant to a Ritz-Carlton in the US. Public Space: The lobby is modern and gorgeous. I did not use any of the restaurants or room service. Nor did I try the 8th floor Spa...although I hear it's quite nice. The club level offered a lounge with quite an elaborate spread for breakfast, high tea, and evening appetizers. Also free wine, beer, soda, and juices. The lounge was awesome and really was a nice perk - especially with the free computer use they offer as well.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful without being too forward. We got room service the first night. There wasn't much choice for vegetarians so I opted for spaghetti with sauce, which was quite boring. Luckily I also ordered a rocket salad which was very good. My partner got salmon and roast vegetables which he really enjoyed. The room itself (Grand King) was comfortable although not very big. The bed was very nice and it was possible to order extra pillows and bedding if required. We were happy with it as it was. There was a flat screen TV (Bang & Olufsen). There were also speakers in the ceiling of the bathroom which was cool. You could lie in the bath and listen to your tunes or watch TV as there was also a smaller flat screen TV in the bathroom. There's a connector cable provided so it's possible to plug your MP3 player or laptop into the system. My only complaint was that the bathroom had sliding doors. One opened directly beside the bed. None of the sliding doors sealed very well which meant there was very little privacy when you used the toilet etc.. The spa was very nice. It wasn't too busy so we had an enjoyable swim etc.. Wireless internet cost 50 cent per minute with a maximum charge of \u20ac18 for a 24 hour period. The location of the hotel is very good. It was clean and to a good standard.

I don't know a lot about Berlin (it was my first visit), but this hotel is really in a great area to explore. There are numerous museums, a big shopping mall, a huge live theater (Blue Man Group had just opened), an IMAX theater (and film museum), all within blocks of this hotel (and the kids loved the Mc Donald's next door!). Oh, and and the Starbuck's right across the street was nice too. We had three rooms in total: my folks had a one-bedroom corner suite on the third floor and we had two separate (two queen bed) rooms on the concierge floor (I think the 23rd floor). The suite was a real gem, with a nice view out of the corner living room that overlooked the front entrance of the hotel. The mini bar was COMPLIMENTARY (the kids loved this, as they had been forbidden to enter the mini bars in any of our previous hotels!), and there was even a stocked bar with liquor as well as a complimentary bottle of wine (my dad cracked this open right away) and a beautiful bowl of fresh fruit and cheese. There was also a DVD player with a BOSE surround sound system in the living room (There was large selection of DVD's to choose from in the concierge club room as well, with lot's of family friendly entertainment). The floor to ceiling doors opened to a bedroom with a king bed. The decor was modern (almost \"cubist\") and predominantly black (of course!), but suprisingly the room was not \"dark\". Our rooms on the upper floors were just as nice for \"regular\" rooms. I loved the utterly modern feel of this hotel. walking down the hallways felt like you were in a futuristic sci-fi movie or on a spaceship. Even the \"do not disturb\" signs on each door is a push button light! The greatest thing about all of the rooms however: the bathrooms. Simply magnificent. I especially liked the \"overflow\" bathtubs... they are enclosed behind glass in a huge travertine shower the size of half the room. There is a \"notch\" cut out of the side of the tub so that you can fill the tub all the way to the brim, and let the water flow over the edge when you get in. To get to soak all the way to the chin is such complete luxury. There is also a flat screen TV and sound system to enjoy while soaking in the tub! I really want to copy that bathroom in my house. As great as the hotel was, the real star of this property are the people. The staff was magnificent, with perfect english (with just the slightest accent, of course!), and a true dedication to service. No request was ignored or delayed, no employee encountered without a smile and warm \"hello.\" A lovely young woman escorted us personally to our rooms and explained all the features and amenities. And did I mention everyone is gorgeous!? There must be a rule that you can't be over 30 to work in this hotel, they all looked like models. The men were even better looking than the women! *sigh* I love Germany. The concierge room was a real treat. Each day it is the offical \"breakfast\" room (included in the room rate). With a lovely continental cold breakfast buffet set up. The coffee is fantastic, with a lovely froth on top from the machine. The wait staff is attentive and always close by. The selection of breads, pastries, & cereals was good and there was also fresh fruit and always a fish and meat selection as well. Oh, and an unexpected bonus for Europe: the room is completely NON-SMOKING for the breakfast service! A lovely way to start the day. In the afternoon, the selection turned to tasty & savory cold appetizers and pastries. Also Coffee, tea and all kinds of soft drinks and juices to try (the banana nectar is great!). And a staff always eager to serve. Small touches abounded: when we arrived in the concierge \"club room\" the first morning for breakfast, we started to push two tables together because our party was large and all the tables were set for four. Well, the staff politely informed us that they would be happy to do it for us, and also that they would have it set up for us in advance each morning of our stay... and so it was the next morning all set up when we walked in. When we left on the final day (sadly) we had rented a large van for the drive to Munich. When we returned to the hotel and loaded up, checked out and finally got ready to go... one of the doormen came out and presented each of us with a large bottle of water to have for our long trip! I was amazed at how considerate this was. One more bonus I forgot to mention... my Dad travels a lot for business, and our entire stay was free with his Hyatt Gold Passport points! The worst thing about our stay is that it was too short... only two nights. The city of Berlin is huge and there is so much to see. I can't wait to go back! I can only hope I'm fortunate enough to stay at the Grand Hyatt again.", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Grand Hyatt\u201d", "Author": "dadinha", "ReviewID": "UR5609438", "Content": "Very good hotel, great design and great rooms.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "CVCVws", "ReviewID": "UR5469236", "Content": "A fine hotel close to everything.
