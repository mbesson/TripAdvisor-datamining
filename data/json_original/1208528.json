{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A great place! We stayed here for 4 nights and found it a very enjoyable stay. Easy to get to, with a underground station just over the road, that also provided convenient access to the rest of Berlin. There is one floor of stairs to walk up but its easy enough. Our room had big windows with good views looking over Wittenbergplatz. The rooms were sizeable and though basic in appearance, were fresh, clean and nicely fitted out. The bed, was two twins pushed together but its was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and not too small. It was quiet except for the morning while the market was set up outside the hotel. Still it was all over relatively quickly and once everything was set up, you heard nothing more of it. All the staff were friendly and though not all spoke English that well we communicated easily enough. Breakfast was fine and always topped up, nor did we feel hurried along to finish by a certain time. Great value and all in all a great place to stay. Would have no trouble returning there, its probably one of the best places we've stayed re a Pension come two star hotel.", "Date": "Nov 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR501214812", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Buoyant130"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1208528-r21812713-Hotel_Pension_Classic-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "1208528", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
