But with the neighbourhood going downhill, note that the hotel also has had a change of management a few years ago, so check the timeline for any guide or review you see. That stretch of St-Hubert Street was never the splendid suburbs, but the National Library taking a whole long block of closed-at-night real estate, a large park squatted with drug dealers that spread to side streets, and a syringe exchange program right across the hotel, it sure didn't get better. Advantages are proximity to downtown core, the Village, the bust station and the main subway exchange station. Disadvantage among a few is that whereas old management was selective in clients and built a long term international following of repeat customers, the new one seems mostly interested in short-term cash. Depending on your room neighbours your milage may vary. But the is better at similar prices. So some folks list their bad experiences here. Any hotel could list a few. Make your own mind, I made mine: After being a regular for over a decade, I visited but did not stay after the new owners took over.", "Date": "May 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sands Point, NY", "Title": "\u201cBe afraid\u201d", "Author": "fratendler", "ReviewID": "UR27423093", "Content": "I am. I'm so disturbed that I felt compelled to write this review almost immediately after I arrived. First of all, the bathroom reeks of smoke, although this proposes to be a \"non-smoking room\". I took the cover, which betrays a nauseating canvas of yellow and brown stains, off of the bed immediately. I'm pretty sure I walked through a sizable area of something sticky on the floor adjacent the bed. I wonder if the hookers outside know what it is. There's no toilet paper. Starbucks napkins are rough. The shutters are patchworked together and look like a broken grill. I can see the junkies outside through the missing slats. We went to the corner deli down the street and a crackhead followed my boyfriend back to the car demanding money. I was unhinged by this. We returned without dinner. I hope tomorrow comes soon. Oh, and it sounds like somebody is dragging a body around in the room above us...and everything in here is this vomitous buttermilk color.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience!\u201d", "Author": "tripper317", "ReviewID": "UR25040805", "Content": "I was a little concerned about this place when I read the reviews, but I gave it a try.

Yes, the place is older and not all rooms have bathrooms in the rooms, but I would not say it was dirty at all. The neighborhood can be a bit sketchy, but I did not feel threatened or unsafe.

First off, on the top floof a piece of the building was missing and it was covered by a tarp. The man who owns the hotel also sleeps in the lobby....weird. I had a friend who missed his flight and needed a place to stay as he could not find a room ANYWHERE. I was staying in a single room but offered him the floor, the guy at the hotel did not like this. He stormed into my room barking at me to get my friend out or to pay an extra $80. It got to the point where I was so terrified that I called 911. I didn't sleep that night but left early thae next morning. I ADVISE YOU NOT TO STAY HERE.

The room was small but the furniture was really nice- and modern. The bed was big and comfy. The owner did not speak english well- but enough to get by. The hotel was 2 bocks from the St. Catherine's street night life- but beware that the night life, and all it brings, does end up in front of the hotel- no prolems -just a bit noisy. We had the front room on the main level- not good if you don't like to be disturbed. The bathroom is really small- and parking is a pain- $17 for the night at the lot- but if you can grab a spot on the street, its free.
