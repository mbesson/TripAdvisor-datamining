Upon entering the main lobby, I could not contain my \"wow\". The structure is so impressive in the way only Disney can do. The theming is fantastic. We had a one bedroom unit that had a nice kitchen and a wonderfully roomy bathroom area, including a large walk in closet. These units are very smartly laid out and make it easy to get comfortable. Since we were on the first floor, we had two walk out patios. The landscaping and decor are very relaxing. The proximity to Magic Kingdom can't be beat - you are right there but feel a world away from the hustle and bustle once you are back at the resort. The staff at the lodge was always very friendly and helpful. We even got to be the flag family and visit the roof of the main lodge. As for cleanliness, I was pretty happy. We left a small gratuity every day and mousekeeping took good care of us with extra toiletries and towel animals for the kids. They kept the room clean and even ran the dishwasher. We did have a couple of issues that were very minor - previous guests had put away the dishes when they were dirty, the shower door was a little rusty and likely needed to be replaced, and mousekeeping forgot to clean the toilet before we checked in. Overall, we were so pleased with the villas and can't wait to return! We booked a bounceback offer and will be back there very soon!

We are DVC members and stayed on points. We stayed in a one bedroom room with a king bed and a sleeper sofa. Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking the front of the villas walk-way from the Wilderness Lodge. Our room was very clean when we arrived. The bedroom had a very comfortable mattress that was soft with good quality sheets and bedding. My wife liked the soft pillows. My daughter said the sleeper sofa was fine and she slept well each night. The bathroom had the toilet in a separate room with its own lockable door. The shower stall was huge with a nice Waterpick shower head. There was a separate area in the bathroom for the large jetted tub and vanity. This is also were the walk-in closet is located. The bathroom was accessed from both the master bedroom and the living area. The kitchen area was spotless when we arrived. The refrigerator was spotlessly clean as was the sink, stove, microwave and dishwasher. Disney does an excellent job in the way it \u201cThemes\u201d its resorts. The Wilderness Lodge is themed just like its name \u2013 as a lodge/log cabin. All areas show Disney\u2019s attention to detail in how the theme is carried out throughout the report. All posts and beams are made to look like logs (if they are not actually wooden logs), and all metal handrails look like small logs. My only complaint about the room is how the bathroom is set up \u2013 there is no way to lock both doors that enter into the master bedroom from the living area and bathroom. There is a lock on the door from the living area to the MBR, but not on the door from the bathroom into the MBR. This door can be locked from the inside to prevent anyone from entering the bathroom, but not from entering the MBR.

The landscaping of the grounds is superb and we really enjoyed walking the nature trail, or even better, hire a surrey bike and save those tired legs. There always seemed to be a quiet corner of the grounds to sit and relax too. The villas building is impressive and the touches and attention to detail is the best that I've seen in Walt Disney World - you can really tell how much effort has gone in to the \"imagineering\" of the resort. The rooms were spotless and well thought out and the balcony, although compact, had a lovely relaxing view of the woods. We found the boat service to Magic Kingdom a great advantage and a novel way of getting to the park. The bus service was ok but it was annoying to detour to Fort Wilderness, often doubling back to continue on to the parks. We were glad to have our hire car - just be careful to remember where you park as the lot shared between the lodge and villas is massive. The staff were always helpful and friendly. The restaurant options were ok - we've eaten at both Whispering Canyon and Artist Point in the past and would definitely recommend the latter. Roaring Forks food court was also good - we used the drink refill station a lot and bought a few snacks from there too. The pool for the villas was quite small but we never found it that busy. The lodge pool was much bigger but in comparison, was always packed.

The Whispering Canyon Cafe is a fun place to eat, the food is very good. It is themed so well, you wouldn't think you're in Florida. It feels just what it was themed for..like you're staying at a lodge in one of our national parks out west! Only drawback with this resort is the main pool. It just isn't on par with other Deluxe resort pools. A better water slide would definitly change my opinion. If the waterslide dosen't bother you then the pool is fine. I'd advise against accepting the handicaped room...unless you need it. We were given this room becuse it was the only one ready when we checked in, I was tired from driving , I just wanted to sleep, so I accepted it. You lose a lot of counter space, plus no eating counter and you need to put a towel in front of shower or your bathroom floor gets wet.

Since we are Disney Vacation Club owners, we generally stay on property at DVC resorts. For this trip, we decided to stay at the Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge due to it's proximity to the Magic Kingdom. We were very happy with our choice! When we arrived at 11:30 AM our room was already ready. Normal check-in for Disney resorts is 3:00 PM, so we were extremely happy to be able to check-in early. We stayed in a studio room which comes equipped with a queen bed, double sleeper sofa, flat screen TV, dvd player, coffee maker, refrigerator, and microwave. We typically have a light breakfast in the room each morning, so the kitchen area made things easy. The resort has a great lobby and the grounds are beautifully maintained. Overall, you really get the feeling of being in the Northwest wilderness. In addition to the pools, the resort offers an arcade, a children's activity center, bike rentals, boat rentals, nightly marshmellow roasting and movies on the beach. We enjoyed a great dinner at the resort's signature restaurant, Artist Point, and the counter service restaurant, Roaring Forks, had lots of quick and tasty options as well. The location of the resort was terrific! The boat ride to the Magic Kingdom took less than 10 minutes. There is also a boat that will take you to the Contemporary Resort, which is convenient if you have reservations at the California Grill or Chef Mickey's.

Check in was seamless and our room was ready early. The lobby is beautiful and filled with similar amenities to the other DVC Villas: a few restaurants, a bar, a gift shop, and arcade. Our room was very similar to the ones we stay at Saratoga Springs in layout, but in decor it had a very cabin like feel and color. It really was too dark for us. My husband made the comment that he would just go to a cabin in the woods if he wanted to stay in a cabin! Ha ha. We stayed in a one bedroom villa that has ample space for two adults and two relatively small kids aged 11 & 13. We will eventually reach a point where the kids will desire more privacy and/or room, but that's another story. Things that we disliked:the decor was too dark and made the room feel dated and the main pool layout seemed as though it was put in as an afterthought in the middle of a walkway. Plus the slide seemed geared toward kids younger than ours. Things we liked: the beach, the staff, the lake, the boat and bike rentals, the ease of transportation, the deer grazing right beside the walkway each evening. In conclusion, it's a great resort, but our family prefers light, open, more modern accommodations. We are used to Saratoga Springs which has an entirely different ambience.

When we checked in, I wasn't thrilled with the news that we had a first floor room but my fears were quickly doused when we arrived in our room. The view out the back windows was of pine trees and there were two small patios, one off the living room and one off the bedroom. It's really too hot to spend too much time sitting outside anyway, so it turned out to be fine. This hotel is big and having a room on the bottom floor made it a lot easier to get to our room after a long day at the park. The room had a \"wilderness\" camping theme. The colors were lots of dark greens, maroons and browns and woodsy looking. I loved the little hidden Mickeys in all of the carpets, curtains etc. There was a stackable washer and dryer, which is very useful. They supply you with one loads worth of soap, so if you plan to wash more, bring some from home. The kitchen was well stocked with everything you would need to prepare a real meal, fridge, regular stove/oven, microwave, dishwasher and untesils. The bathroom is a splt bathroom,with a toilet and sink and shower in one room area with a door and then the jacuzzi tube and sink in another half. The tub has a window that over looks the bedroom, but there are louvered shutters that you can close. There is a sofa bed in the living room that is really easy to set up and is quite comfy. The master bedroom had a King size bed, and extra overstuffed chair, dresser and a flat screen tv. There was also a flat screen tv in the living room. Overall, it was comfy and perfect for the three of us. The lodge itself is beautiful. There is a ferry that takes you to the magic kingdom and is really quick. There is an awesome \"quiet\"pool. There is also a pool with a slide, bar etc. The only downside I could say is that the parking lot and the rooms are really far apart.

Could only see trees. It was so humid from first thing you couldn't sit out there. The staff was very switched on and helpful, no mistakes on billing, no lost dinner res;s, which I am used to from travelling mostly Carribean. A well oiled machine. Ran out of shampoo and called to ask if its supplied or do they sell it downstairs and they said it's not supplied but they sent up 2 weeks supply of everything. The main pool was packed and not much fun because of that. Bratty kids running loose. The villas pool was less packed but I had to keep telling my kids not to splash!! People were enjoying quiet relaxation. It would have been good if we could each go to different pools!! LOL I found the best feature of this resort the close walk to the boat shuttle from the villa (something other people complain about and I don't get it!) and the short, direct, ride over to MK which brings you right to the front gate. I think it took me just as long to walk to our rental car in the resort parking lot as it did to get to the boat dock. I rented a van and used it every day. A grocery trip, wallmart trip, other resort dining, and to other parks. Well worth it IMO. It took so little time to get to the other parks and resorts. good advantage to be able to drop the seniors off at the door then go park. Parking was easy everywhere and fast shuttles from parking. We took the boat to MK to Grand Floridian one night and it took an hour and a half.....boats also don't run if there's lightening!! Most dissapointing was the meal plan. I made a few in park dinner reservations and we had to get out of the parks around 3 cause it was 98'F. This left us with not what I would have liked for last minute dinner choices. Believe me, one night at the wispering canyon is enough. The second night I had an extremley overcooked steak and some chip and southwest dip app that tasted like dirt. I would have eaten more off property for some more fresher food options, probably half the price. They're not that far of a drive and I think would have been more enjoyable for all. Not to mention the 6 desserts left in our fridge on check out ....and thats with 2 kids!!! It would have been nice to have more dining options on site. I think my next choice would be the grand floridian as when we went there for dinner it is close to everything and offers more options...and no forest themes...I'm from Canada eh? no big deal, would rather have something more elegant.

We rented a Queen Studio room, which provided us a fridge (bigger than the standard micro-fridge), microwave, toaster, and coffeemaker. The room itself was non-descript basically about 2/3 the size of a standard Embassy Suite room. It had a sofa and TV and standard bathroom, nothing fancy. The one minor annoying aspect was the placement of the TV inside the console and could only be viewed from the bed and not the sofa. The grounds surrounding the lodge are very nice and cozy; there are two pools, one near the villa which is smaller and quieter then the main pool at the lodge which is only a short walk. There are hiking and biking areas to enjoy, there is a also a non-swimming beach area . One the main perks I enjoy staying on a Disney property is the extended park hours for guest and if you want access for free parking throughout Disney.

Rocking chairs inside and out - fireplaces and lovely areas to sit or gather.

My son and I shared a studio room with a friend of mine and her 16 year old daughter. The room was spacious...my friend and her daughter slept in the queen-sized bed, I slept on the sofa bed, and my son slept on a twin-sized air mattress on the floor. There was plenty of room to walk around in the room even with the air mattress on the floor. The commode and tub were separate from the bathroom sink/vanity which made it nice in the mornings! There was a small kitchen sink and under-cabinet refrigerator in the room along with a coffee pot, microwave, and toaster. Since we were using the Disney Dining Plan we didn't need anything more from a kitchen. The room was quiet, and we were never bothered with any noise. Check out was awesome! We used the Disney airline check-in service which allowed us to check our luggage and print our boarding passes without leaving the resort! We were very thankful to already have those boarding passes when we arrived at the airport and saw the long lines for for Air Tran! Now for the \"not so positive\" things. 1) Our room (room 3562) was the last room in the longest hallway of the Villas! We were at least 1/4 of a mile away from the bus stops, so by the end of the day, that 1/4 of a mile felt like another 14 miles!!! If you have the quick service dining plan, you should also plan on walking a long way to the Roaring Fork restaurant because it's located on the back side of the Wilderness Lodge near the pool...this is farther away than the bus stops. There is a boat available to take you to/from the Magic Kingdom, but from our room, it was a good 1/2 mile walk. I am not exaggerating these distances....I felt like I was in Vegas! 2) You don't always get what you request. My friend has been a member of DVC since 2002 and commented that she had never had such a problem with her reservation. She made her reservation in November and we traveled in June so the reservation was made in plenty of time. When we arrived at the Villas, she was given a handicap accessible room which had a bathroom where the sink/vanity was in the same room as the shower and commode. This did not work for us since no one would be able to use the sink/vanity if someone else was in the shower. And, if you have small children, there is no tub in the handicap accessible rooms. She requested a room change and that is when we were given the room in BFE! On her reservation, she had requested a room near the laundry facilities which at the Wilderness Villas is near the front door on the first floor and she reminded them of this. She was informed that they would try to accommodate her, but they could only work with the Studio rooms that were coming available from people checking out on that date. So...as the story goes....your requests don't really mean a lot. 3) The laundry facilities are very lacking. There are 2 washers (one of which was broken the entire time we were there) and 4 dryers. Not much for a facility the size of the Wilderness Villas. I know that this doesn't mean much if you're staying in one of the larger rooms since they have washers and dryers, but it does if you're in the studio room. Who wants to spend 2 or 3 hours doing laundry with there one washer? 4) Our room did not have a view. I have read other reviews that commented on the view of the lake, but our room had a view of the service road.

The water launch was excellent to Magic Kingdom and we didn't wait long coming or going at any time. We LOVED the boat where we didn't have to collapse the stroller down to get across. My family and I had not been to Disney in 10 years and assumed we would come back in another 10.

Despite this convenience, we felt that the villa side of Wilderness Lodge was very quiet, peaceful, and almost another world. We never heard any other families while in our villa. We felt like we had the place to ourselves. But the lodge and all of its conveniences was a very short walk away - even with 2 young children. We would get breakfast in the lodge at the counter service place and bring it up to our room many mornings. This was easy and convenient. We stayed in a 1-bedroom which worked out perfect for us. We had a little patio with a woods view near the villa pool. I was a little nervous about being so close to the pool, but we never found it to be noisy at all. We enjoyed sitting out there in the evenings and looking at the stars and trees. The beds were not particularly comfortable, but they were not terrible. Our villa was stocked with Palmolive dish soap, and Tide laundry detergent in addition to the usual supplies (pots, pans, plates). Housekeeping was very accomodating of our schedule without any special requests on our part. The villa pool was far less busy than the main pool at the lodge. The theming was very well done at this resort, and it made the place even more special. We would not hesitate to stay here again, although since we are curious, we may try another resort next time.

We were booked in Kidani Village but had lunch at Whispering Canyon on our first full day. Wow. We took the boat over from Magic Kingdom and it was fun and easy. Our jaws dropped when we walked in the place. It's beyond gorgeous. The lobby was towering with the biggest Christmas tree we had ever seen and thick, heavy garland and twinkling lights. Everyone seemed friendly and relaxed. Soft, traditional holiday music played in the background. That was it, it was love at first site. When my husband went to check in at the cafe, I visited the concierge and begged for a room transfer. Wow! talk about accomodating! They went well over and above to arrange it for the following day. We left Kidani early and checked in at the Wilderness Villas. The process was quick and painless. They took our cell number and texted us when our room was ready. We could not wait to see it. Wow! What a room! The Villas are a short walk from the main lobby under a covered walkway. Our room was around the center atrium. The decor was stunning. Garland and twinking lights the whole way. Short walks all around. Oh, and the scent... Have you ever been in the woods after a rain, surrounded by ferns and smelled that fresh, earthy smell? Yep, it smells that way on the walk to the Villas. The room was a one bedroom and HUGE. The kitchen was well stocked with real dishes and cutlery (Kidani had a few paper plates and plastic ware). The master bedroom was huge with an extraordinarily comfortable king bed. The kids loved the sofa bed. We all loved the huge jetted tub, separate shower, and plentiful storage. Everything worked as it should. Having a washer and dryer was wonderful. It was blessedly quiet and so convenient to everything. The busses worked very well and the boat was a delight. We loved the pools and hot tubs. The kids enjoyed the water slide and the bubbly water in the second pool. We didn't use the health club but it looked very clean and well equipped. We at at Whispering Canyon twice and that was fun. Roaring Forks was quite nice and the food tasty. Our favorite food was Artist Point - our waitress was fabulous and the food divine. We brought our 6 year old and 12 year old and they were warmly welcomed. To summarize, we adored the Villas at Wilderness Lodge. They were beautiful and so convenient.

We stayed in a two bedroom villa which was perfect for us. Travel from the airport to the lodge was a breeze. We took the magical express from the airport. There was no wait and our bags arrived shortly after we did to the hotel. Return to the airport was even easier. We had a late 8PM flight on the day of check out and it was so nice to be able to check our bags for our flight that morning and get our boarding passes right in the hotel lobby. They held our carry-ons for us while we enjoyed our last day in the magic kingdom. Villa: The villa itself was very comfortable with a great layout for our family. Each bedroom was spacious and clean (one with king, second with two full beds) with large closets and baths. The kitchen/combined living room was well stocked. There was laundry detergent, paper towels, coffee maker etc... It was great after a long day at the parks to have the living area to relax. Our son loved it. Housekeeping came daily. The only drawback to the villa was that we were on the 5th floor and VERY far from the elevator. I'm a fit person but after walking in the parks all day then walking up and down that hallway all week , it got old fast. We ordered groceries ahead of time at gardengrocer.com. They were waiting for us when we checked in and were delivered to our room when we checked in. Wilderness Lodge in General: A wonderful place. We researched for a while and after stopping at many of the other hotels to compare during our stay we were so happy that we went with the Villas at Wilderness Lodge. The grounds were beautiful. My son loved seeing the rabbits, ducks, the geyser, the lobby is breathtaking. It was great to take the boat over to the magic kingdom or contemporay and hop on the monorail. The bus service to the other parks was also great. The pools were very nice. The main pool was very crowded at times. Liked the pool at the villas better ...smaller/quiet. Cubs Den: We also made a reservation one night for our son to have dinner on his own at the cubs den while my husband and I had a date. He absolutely loved it. The space itself is small but they have many toys, computers, sand pit for the kids and they eat dinner there as well. He was very content here and we had a wonderful time off on our own for a few hours. We found the price of $12/hour to be very reasonable. Dining: We were pleasantly surprised by the dining choices at Disney. We didn't go with very high expectations. Whispering Canyon in the lobby was an excellent choice for dinner our 1st night. Several of us got the all you can eat BBQ and it was great. We had a wonderful meal at the California Grill our last night. The fireworks were amazing with the most spectacular view. We also had a very nice lunch one day at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. The food in the parks was ok. Chef Mickey's for breakfast also just ok. Our son LOVED getting to see all of the characters here. So glad we got him an autograph book. In the parks you have to wait in line to see them but at Chef Mickey's all the characters come right up to the table. It was great; lots of good pics. The Roaring Fork at the Wilderness had great quick options. We tried to do a quick service at the Polynesian one day and left when nothing looked good to us. Territory lounge at night was also a great place in the lobby for a drink. Wished we could've bought beer at a reasonable price to keep in the fridge in the villa ($5 for one can) steep in the lobby shop. Wine was reasonably priced but limited selection. Gym: The gym was great and modern and on the 1st floor off the lobby in the villas building. All the cardio, wts etc. You could access it 24 hrs/d. My husband worked out just about everyday at 5AM. My husband and I enjoyed some wine in the lobby at the Grand Floridian one night while listening to a jazz band. Beautiful lobby. It seemed less geared towards children but really was pretty. Might be a better place for families with little girls. Lots of little girls dressed up taking pictures in the lobby while we were there. Loved the white lobby and they had a great selection of wine. Couldn't be any closer to the magic kingdom here either. We also loved seeing all of the animals at the Animal Kingdom Lodge while we enjoyed lunch. We debated booking here at first but after visiting I'm glad we didn't only because it really is so far away from everything else at Disney. All in all: wonderful stay! This was our sons 1st trip to Disney so we wanted to do it right and do everything we thought he would enjoy the most. I highly recommend the Villas at Wilderness Lodge.

We were all excited to see how Disney deluxe accomodations would compare with those at a moderate. We were also looking forward to sleeping in larger beds (king with a queen sofa bed). And it was my husband's birthday, which I had let the reservationist know when she asked if we were celebrating anything. So I expected it to be fun at check-in, with my husband receiving and (undoubtedly be embarrassed) by a \"happy birthday\" and birthday button. Rocky Start However, though we loved the villas, our trip kind of got off on the wrong foot. I would not mention any of the following things but these villas, reserved through the Disney reservation system, are not inexpensive and my expectations were high. We had caught the boat from the French Quarter to downtown Disney, and had a wonderful lunch at Wolfgang Puck's. We decided we would have to return on our last day prior to departing for our late afternoon flight to get meals to bring on the plane. We caught the bus from downtown Disney to the Wilderness Lodge, and soon realized the long bus ride meant we would not have time to return to do a last-day stop at Wolfgang's.. The bus stopped at Typhoon Lagoon, and there was also an at least ten minute stop at Pleasure Island -- there isn't much left open at Pleasure Island, but it seemed to take some time to do a driver change. This was probably the longest bus ride we were on during our stay at Disney World. When we went to check-in at the Wilderness Lodge, there was no friendly greeting or mention of my husband's birthday or button (I know this may seem silly to mention, but I wanted him to get the full Disney treatment). We asked about our luggage transfer and the desk clerk checked and said it had not arrived and gave us a number to call to inquire further. My husband asked if she could check for us, and she did, only to find our luggage was not even en route -- it was still sitting at Port Orleans. So we went up to our room and immediately rushed to our balcony to take in the view. It was a view of the rooftop and the bus stop. My husband called Port Orleans and spoke to a supervisor at the Bell Desk, who arranged for our luggage to be taken over to us. My daughter had been excited about going to the pool, and we were all anxious to get out and see the property, but the swim suits were packed in our luggage that was being transferred and we had to just wait around in the room for a couple of hours for the luggage to arrive. I had suggested to my husband previously that we just catch a taxi and move our luggage ourselves, but everyone at Disney had been so exceptional prior to all this so he thought it would be okay. But next time we would move it in a taxi. I called the front desk to see if (1) they had any way of acknowledging birthdays and (2) if we could get a room with a better view. The lady at the front desk said they could send him a Mickey Mouse birthday card if I wanted, but he would not get it until the next day. I said that was fine. She then switched me over to another person about changing our room. This lady was extremely gracious and helpful and said that, while there were no rooms with better views available that day, she could move us the next morning so that is what we did. As it turned out, we did find the Mickey Mouse birthday card in our room when we returned from dinner at 1900 Park Fair that evening. It didn't have my husband's name on it, but it had arrived on his birthday. Our five year old immediately appropriated the card, saying that she thought Mickey had meant to leave it for her because she had met him the previous day and thought she must have made a good impression! We were very glad to receive the card. Wound up being a Great Place to Stay! Despite the intial disappointments, the one bedroom suite was really wonderful! As much as we loved the French Quarter, it felt so luxurious to be at the villas! The beds were large and comfortable, and there was a wonderful jacuzzi tub and shower and walk-in closet. There was a full kitchen where we could keep and reheat leftovers. The washer and dryer was SO convenient -- I was able to wash all of the dirty clothes we had accumulated in the first part of our stay. There were two television sets, a comfortable living room and a pleasant balcony amid the trees. We were really able to relax at this resort. I can certainly see why people would invest in these timeshares -- such a comfortable base when you're out doing the parks all day! The cleaning staff at this resort were absolutely excellent. Our rooms were extremely clean and well-kept. We asked for extra hangers and someone came immediately. They were really great! The grounds at the Wilderness Lodge are magnificent, among tall pine trees with a created waterfall, a white sand beach and playground, and a geyser that goes off in the background. We saw one very tame brown bunny that was allowing a little girl to get close enough to almost touch. There were two pools -- one smaller one by the villas and a larger one with waterslide in the main area. In the afternoons they host games at the pool. The boat service to and from the Magic Kingdom is delightful. We didn't wait long for boats, and the trip was not long. One evening, quite by accident, we found ourselves returning on the boat during Wishes, and it was fun to watch the fireworks from that vantage point. I was taken with how majestic the Wilderness Lodge looks at night. lanterns light the walkway from the boat dock among the Pines. The waterfall, pool and grounds look particularly spectacular amidst the night lighting.

It was hot outside on the 22nd but once you got inside it was air conditioned and all the different tiki poles and how huge it is was pretty breath taking also. Check-in was faster than we could say \"Disney World\". We had a room in the Villas part on the 3rd floor around the hexagon I believe. The view was not great but the room its self was huge. We had our own kitchen so we cooked for 3 of the night we stayed which was money -saving and extremely conveinient.There was our own washer and dryer so we could wash our clothes and that means less luggage. My daughter had her toe bleed because of the metal thingy (forgot the name). The bed was big and comfortable. The bath was huge and so was the shower. We had a double sink which had not madness to fight for it. The walk to the pool was a short walk. Theres 2 different pools and both were great. But we used the Villas pool at about 8 o clock so the water was warm and we had it all to ourselves. It rained alot so we barely passed going to the hollywood studios because it was a raging storm. The walkway to the Wilderness Main Hotel was nice because you could see the flowers outside and a short walk to the Disney Buses was great. The indoor river was magnificent so we took alot of pictures. Theres 1 store for food or clothing and even games but I thought they shouldve had atleast 1 more store there. The Roaring Forks was good. We got the mugs so we dont have to pay like 15.00 for 4 sodas. (im just guessing). We went to Whispering Canyons one night and that was FUNNY. We had a waiter with funny glasses so my son loved that. He also needed Ketchup (for those who know what happens with that). So the waiter yells for ketchup and every single bottle of ketchup is brought to our table. 2 teenagers actually met there also while we were there. Short boat ride to the Magic Kingdom and buses to the other parks and downtown disney. We went to the House of Blues for breakfast and there was many food and drinks to choose from. I couldnt choose!

We had a two-bedroom suite. I shared the suite with my 3 children (7, 4, 1) and my parents. My husband could not come with due to work, but there would have been more than enough space for him as well. We had stayed in the Lodge about 3 years ago and loved the location and calmness of the Lodge. The Villa was nice - but one complaint was that it needed cleaned for the price of a $600+ night villa. It was fine per Comfort Inn standards - there were no outward dirt. But, we did find a teething ointment bottle folded up in the port-a-crib that came with the room. My father snores - and so my mom reported that the fold out sofa was comfortable. The villa was big enough that I didn't hear him, which is a good thing. The kitchen was clean, no spoons or bowls - which made breakfast interesting. Beware of the jets in the tub. I didn't notice that some were higher than others and ended up spraying my mother in the face with them when my daughter asked to see the bubbles. Again - not perfect, but funny. The kids loved the towels folded as animals. The location is great. We had a 8AM breakfast scheduled with Cinderella and we were told to catch the 7:30 boat. Unfortunately, the 7:30 boat was training new boaters - so we were left somewhat stranded. Panic is not allowed on vacation, so we loaded ourselves on the ferry to the Contemporary Hotel and then the monorail to the Kingdom. We made it with 5 minutes to spare. What started out as a bit stressful time ended up as one of my favorite memories. They let us into the Park before the masses - and then my 4 year old daughter - afraid to miss her meeting with Cinderella, hiked up her Belle dress and sprinted down Main Street full speed ahead. I had my video camera out and caught a bit of the action. I couldn't stop laughing at the sight of a little Princess running to her castle with all of the Disney music playing in the background. But as far as the Lodge was concerned, a bit of coordination and heads-up would have been nice when we asked about early transportation to the Park at the desk the day before. Would this happen at the Ritz? no. The Children's Activities were fun for my 7 and 4 year old. They gathered kids up and the pool and had games in the sand. The pool was busy and I did run into strict rules, which are a bit irritating. They have ducks in the pool - which is why I marked them down for cleanliness. My daughter wanted to swim with the ducks. So, I said gross, but okay and off she went. I sat near the edge of the pool with my diet Coke watching her. I was told that I couldn't have drinks in the pool. I wasn't in the pool, but said okay and put it behind my back. She told me that I had to have it 6 feet from the pool. Now, let me understand this - duck poop in the pool - okay - a diet coke 2 feet from the pool - not okay. It is just that you are paying lots of money and expect to be treated like you are home... not in kindergarten. The view was great - 4th floor with partial lake view. The room was big and everything worked. I don't like the Disney bus service and we didn't use it. But the boats were great and one afternoon they even passed out swards and the kids led by the co-pilot stood at the front of the ship and took over other Ferry boats pirate style.

We had a one-bedroom suite, and my in-laws had a studio which connected to ours through double doors that could be locked on either side. To say we were impressed is an understatement. First, the resort itself is very beautiful - from the moment you walk into the well-decorated lobby at the main resort - you hear quiet, relaxing music and the sound of a bubbling creek; there are tall totem polls and comfy chairs. Go through the lobby and turn right through double doors, and you are on the covered path to the Villas. I found the Villas building to be quiet and more mellow than the main lodge. The rooms are beautifully decorated and ours was clean and not worn at all - reading some of the previous reviews, maybe we got lucky, but everything was in great shape. We traveled with our two boys, who are 4 and 1, and they both had a great experience. They adored the jacuzzi tub - it has never been easier to give them a bath! We asked for a crib rather than the standard pack-n-plays that come with the room, and it was delivered promptly. I was impressed with how large and comfortable it was. The mattress on our bed was soft for my taste, but basically okay. The outer room had a TV with a DVD player (nice when your kids want you up at 5:45 a.m. and you need a little time to relax and make coffee). There was a balcony with a woods view, and there were tall pine trees all around. A hawk landed right outside of our room on the last day; ducks swim in the main pool on a regular basis and we saw rabbits, too. The pools are fantastic. There is a very quiet, kidney-shaped pool in the Villas area, along with a spa. Towels and poolside seating are convenient. If you walk along the path toward the main building, you can see a beach by the lake (no swimming in the lake but you don't miss it since the pools are right there) - my youngest one loved digging in the sand, which is clean and soft. The pool by the main building is much larger and it is busier, but it wasn't crazy crowded when we went. There is also a nice shallow wading pool for younger kids, which both the boys enjoyed. One perk for parkgoers is the boat transportation to and from the Magic Kingdom. The buses are more conveniently located when you stay at the Villas, but if you care to take a walk to the other side of the resort, the boats can take you to Fort Wilderness or the Magic Kingdom. The ride itself is short (less than ten minutes) and so relaxing - you can see wading birds, as well as the other resorts. My boys loved the boat rides we took. Bus transportation elsewhere is doable. I found that the buses came pretty frequently, and there are comfortable places to sit while you wait. My husband and I cannot wait to go back to the Villas at Wilderness Lodge, especially when our boys are older and we can do a bit more. All in all, I highly recommend this place, especially for families with young children.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redding, CA", "Title": "\u201cResort was the Highlight!\u201d", "Author": "conkime", "ReviewID": "UR23286223", "Content": "The Wilderness Villas was a refreshing finish to each day.

It was always quite there, I did not hear many noise levels in the hallways. The one bedroom was equipped with a full kitchen (stove, microwave, washer/dryer and sink with all the works such as detergent for clothes and dishes). The down side was that the washer and dryer & the bathroom toilet was extremely loud! You can seriously be awaken by the toilet being flushed (with the doors closed)! Also, my husband has allergies and he had a reactive symptom there because I think they need to change the air filters and some furniture needed dusting (I did it myself- which was no big deal). You can take the ferry boat to magic kingdom and the shuttles to the other parks. One thing I've learned was that you can't take the bus to get from one hotel to the other, except to get to the Grand Floridian on the hollywood studio bus. The Whispering Canyon restaurant in the hotel is okay and the roaring fork was decent for fast food. The lobby and restaurants are separate from the villas (it is about a 2 minute walk).

This was our first trip to WDW with kids and parents, so we wanted to make every effort to select somewhere very accessible. Since we knew working around nap time would be a must, accommodations close to the Magic Kingdom were the most important thing to us.. I am happy to say we could not be more pleased with the Wilderness Lodge. Regarding location, we found both the bus and ferry to be very prompt, with neither requiring more than a 15 minute wait. We had booked several character breakfasts at various resorts, in the early morning hours (7:30-8:00 am). Even at that hour, we found access from the Lodge to be prompt and without hassle. Regarding the Lodge itself, we opted to stay in a two bedroom villa in order to have the entire family together, and allow room for the kids and parents to rest without interruption. We were extremely impressed with our villa. The layout was excellent, everything was extremely clean, and both the furniture and beds were comfortable. If you enjoy a little quiet time after a busy day at the parks, you certainly find it at the villas. Not once did we experience noise from the corridor ,never waited on an elevator, and a pool designed to serve those staying at the Villas was a short walk away. I have noticed others writing on Trip Advisor had mixed reviews regarding customer service. However, we were very happy with our experience in this category as well. We arrived several hours prior to check in and found the front desk willing to go ahead and check us in. Our luggage actually beat us to our villa! We rented a car during our stay. Apparently the bellman noticed this when we arrived, as he brought a map with our luggage and highlighted the nearest grocery store, restaurants, etc.. The conceirge's desk was extremely helpful, making several reservations for us and never attempted to rush us into making a decision. Another great thing about the Lodge is all the entertainment available without leaving the resort. Between the two pools, bikes, boat rental, arcade, and walking trails, you can spend the day having fun without ever leaving, just in case you want to take a day off from the parks.

This made it one stop shopping as we purchased our theme park tickets, made reservations for dinner and picked up confirmation notices on previously made reservations. The property is not large and spread out like Saratoga Springs or Old Key West so it was easy walking distance to the bus or boat transportation and back to the main building. The lodge is well maintained, clean and the theming inside the main building and around the pool areas are pleasing to the eyes. The one area that we were a little displeased with was the bus transportation. I recommend the boat to MK it is more reliable even though it is only a 5 minute bus ride from the lodge. The problem that week seemed to be infrequent bus transportation more than 20 minutes apart and in our case almost a 45 minute wait for buses to Epcot or the Studios. Buses to these two resorts first stop at the Floridian so be prepared for crowded buses. All in all it was a pleasant experience, we rate this resort above both Saratoda Springs and Old Key West but a notch below the Boardwalk. We have not been to AK Lodge or the Beach Club so I can't comment if the Wilderness Lodge is a better stay. Its main advantage is it is close to the MK and the compact nature of the resort.

The room was very clean and stocked up with all the \"starter\" packs you get with DVC-coffee, Tide, etc...The king size bed was wonderful, but the pull out sofa bed was dubbed \"the Black Hole\" by my 6 year old. Housekeeping was a mixed bag. We asked for bed rails and received those with no problem, but a couple nights later we asked for an extra blanket and it took 3 calls and a walk to the front desk before we could get one. We had a \"trash and tidy\" visit on our 4th day, and the beds were made, trash was taken out, and supplies were replenished. The villas are located off of the main lodge, but they are an easy walk from anywhere on the property. The property was extremely quiet and nice to come back to after being at the parks during one of their busiest weeks of the year. The grounds are gorgeous. There is a small sandy beach in the back with boat docks and a place to rent boats/bikes. We rented 2 Sea Racers one afternoon, and the price was very reasonable. They allow anyone over the age of 12 or 13 drive the boats, which I think is a bit young. We experienced a very hairy situation when a young boy was trying to maneuver his boat throught the canal at the same time one of the Disney ferries was going through. If you're going to let your pre-teen drive the boat, please go with him. The villas have a small, \"geyser\" pool, which was very nice. The main pool behind the lodge was very large, with plenty of pool chairs. Every afternoon they had a \"pool party\" with Limbo, Hula Hoop contests, dancing, and more. There is a bar and deli area right near the main pool area as well. There is some outside seating for eating, but the ducks and birds are VERY aggressive, and if being stalked by birds is not your thing I would not recommend eating outside. Transportation was never a problem. We waited probably not more than 10 minutes for a bus to any of the parks. We took the boat to MK one morning and it was quick and very peaceful. There is also a boat to the Contemporary, which we took one morning and then jumped on the monarail for a ride.

The room was spotless: the kitchen appliances were clean and functioning, the master bathroom was perfect. both bedrooms had small balconies that had partial views of the large quiet pool. the building was also very welcoming and fully encompassed the hotel's theme, as is expected with Disney resorts. The main pool area is wonderful, with a gentle waterfall safe enough for children. The pool bar is good, but the pool bars at the Coronado Springs and the Boardwalk were better. The snack bar near the pool provided a wealth of snacks for everyone throughout the day, and our group would get breakfast there if we weren't going to a theme breakfast that day. The staff was friendly, though we bumped into a few staff members that weren't exactly feeling the \"Disney magic\". We didn't let that get to us. Mostly everything we needed was taken care of immediately. There are two restaurants in the hotel, and we only ate at the theme restaurant (its a barbeque restaurant). Be prepared for very involved waitstaff - if you don't like LOUD, crazy, get you up out of your seat to do a rodeo dance around the room kind of dining, then i suggest you don't go here. it's a great atmosphere for kids, but only go there if you are open to semi-obnoxiousness and you have a sense of humor. the food there is pretty good too... LOVED the pulled pork!! Okay, now here's the bad news. The second night in the hotel my friends and I used the hotel hot tub. Two days later I woke up with the WORST allergic reaction I've ever had in my entire life all over my legs. We actually had to have a doctor come to the hotel to diagnose me, as I could barely walk. The doctor (employed by DisneyWorld) diagnosed the reaction as a reaction to potential hot tub bacteria that soaked into the pores in my legs. it's why the reaction stopped at my bathing suit line. when we informed the hotel, they were not receptive to the informaiton. they refused to take responsibility for it, which was very disappointing as we have been so impressed with Disney in the past. Fortunately, they did end up taking responsibility and covering all medical costs. However, my 10 day trip was essentially cut short - not only was it unbearably itchy, but it was so embarrassing to walk around with - people actually were commenting and asking me what was wrong (not Disney's fault). I was also unable to go out in the sun, as it would potentially irritate it. I ended up sleeping through the days and only going out at night. Other than this setback, we enjoyed our vacation thoroughly. We have been to DisneyWorld over 18 times and never expect less than the best.

Sure, the microwave and toaster was nice, but not worth close to $500; the walk to get coffee in the morning took about 20 minutes and was very inconvenient. We stayed at the end of a very long hall, but I think it would be a pain in any room. A simple coffee stand/shop in the villas would have made a huge difference; after sending 2 faxes and a request at check-in asking for a \"room with a water or pool view\", our view ended up being of the back of the resort facing the linen storage area (we thought they were garbage bins at first); the maid service was a mid sporatic as we came \"home\" one day at 3:00 to an unserviced room which was a bit odd. Please don't think my \"cons\" suggest the place wasnt great.

This review covers my stay at the Wilderness Lodge Villas from May 29th thru June 3rd. You will have to read the extension of my review once we reached the Villas at Boardwalk Inn. Our trip began with a stay at the Wilderness Lodge Villas. We had visited the Lodge before to have dinner at the Whispering Canyon Restaurant and toured the grounds. To say we were impressed at what we saw and the excitement we felt as we checked in would be an understatement. We were checked in right away and placed in Room 3059. After a long day of travel getting to Florida, all we wanted to do was take a shower, rest for a bit and hit the parks that evening. When we first got to our room we found lights burned out on the bedside and the bathroom, and as we unpacked and started to stock our refrigerator I noticed there was a crack in the handle that subsequently pinched me at the tip of my finger. Not a good first impression. I told the front desk receptionist about our experience as we left for the park. When we returned, the lights had been fixed, but the fridge had not. Also as we settled in the night, I noticed a smell from behind the couch and so I pulled the couch out from the wall to find pepperoni left behind. To say it was disgusting would be in jest as my feelings to the overall attention to cleanliness and detail were far from positive. The next morning I got up to get a bottle of water from the fridge and again was pinched by the broken plastic handle. That was it and I felt I needed to communicate my disappointments with a manager. I went downstairs and spoke with a manger by the name of Alisha. She listened to all my concerns, apologized for the occurrences and assured me that the room would be cleaned again and fridge repaired to the best of her ability. I thanked her for her time and left for a day in the parks. When my family returned we were glad to see that the room had been cleaned, fridge replaced, but the complimentary fruit basket and note of apology was amazing. That bit of hospitality went a long way and helped put our trip on a magical course again. We stayed at the Lodge till June 3rd.
