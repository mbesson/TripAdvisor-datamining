I went into to this hotel expecting the worst, and was impressed with that I was provided, for the cost, and what wasn't as had been posted here. The check-in process was very smooth, I had made my reservation online through the hotel website. I arrived, and filled out the paperwork and got my keycards, which nicely work as discounts at various locations around Branson, one of ours was for Dixie Stampede which is just across the strip and the other was for the tracks. The room, which of average quality, had a king sized bed believe it was 305. It was located in the front building. There was not a elevator, so you had to take the stairs, which I guess is a negative for some. The bed featured no heavy comforter, so unsure if this is a seasonal thing, or just a norm for this hotel. The room had some signs of wear, but nothing to complain about, some paint chipped on the wall in the bathroom, and some scrapes in the sink from wear. The AC unit worked well. The door did seem to shut quite loudly, it caught and you had to slam it. All the doors open up onto a balcony type area to the outside, but that isn't a big deal to me. We didn't have any issues with noise, or neighbors. No major issues to report at all, both the wife and I agreed it was good and fine for us, and I try to stress that normally we stay in Hampton Inn's when we travel. The breakfast that some previous posters complained about, it a normal \"free\" breakfast, which is served at the Rowdy Beaver, which is located just to the West of the hotel. The breakfast offers cereal, pancakes, waffles, sausage and gravy, fruit, and muffins. They also had coffee, and apple and orange juice. I found it to be filling and good quality. They didn't seem to mind if you went back for seconds either like some places. They had a very friendly lady, who welcomed you, and cleaned up your trash. There was a booth setup in the lobby where you can get \"free\" show tickets, in exchange for you looking at a resort. We didn't do it, but the woman there was happy to explain to us some of the good shows she would suggest. She had told us for about 90 minutes of our time, we could get a couple show tickets. We didn't like the idea of being locked into having to look over something.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flushing, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery Acceptable\u201d", "Author": "Kruiser48433", "ReviewID": "UR138908778", "Content": "Room was clean and well appointed, Breakfast was hot and good and included with room and bacon or sausage was available for a nominal cost.

Both pools were very nice and well cared for. We saw hotel personell making regular rounds, caring for the pool occasionally. We especially enjoyed the breakfast experience. It was more than a continental breakfast, with several hot items. Sausage and bacon were not included, but there was plenty without sausage and bacon. My personal favorite were the biscuits and gravy, as well as the fried potato wedges-they were amazing!! There was not juice, but plenty of coffee and pop. Our kids would rather have pop anyway. The hostess of the breakfast was a Loretta Lynn impersonator, and she definitely added to the \"Branson experience\". She was very kind, and she also sang a few songs. The staff were friendly, and very helpful. On the morning that we left, we asked for directions, and one of the hotel employees gladly helped and gave us the help we needed.

But the experience made such an impression that I will never forget it and feel compelled to share it. If the condition of the hotel has changed since my stay, or since those who stayed at the end of 2011 (based on the reviews below) I can not say. So judge this review based upon the fact that my stay was not recent. First let me say the location is good since it was right off the strip, and the club house where you check in is very nice, but that is where the happy part of this review ends. My wife, child and I entered into what could only be described as a horror movie (place pschyo music here) the moment we stepped into the room. First the bathroom was flithy (notice that is worse than dirty) the tub appeared as if it had hardly seen the underside of a scrub brush and never been exposed to cleaning agents and we wont discuss the toilet. But that isn't the worst of it. Our sheets had odd stains on them and one of the queen beds had some sort of crumbs strewn all over it. And the carpet left nasty black stuff on your feet. The door to our room seemed to be closed but somehow a parade of ants and other insects had no problem getting into our room. While I was able to kill a few with my shoe the majority were too small and numerous to destroy. We had a 3 night stay planned in this hotel but since it was too late to leave we huddled down in our clothes with our shoes on and barely slept while laying on top of the comforter all night. EARLY in the morning we stormed to the front desk raised hell and promptly left the premises. We called AAA (thank God for them) and they promptly booked us into the Comfort Inn & Suites off Gretna Road. (Which was like HEAVEN after our stay at the Ramada) where we stayed the next several days. Now I don't say this lightly but if the Bates Motel was real... I believe that staying there would have been a better stay than this. Now again, I do not know if this hotel has changed or is under new management (We can only hope) but when I stayed here a few years ago it was just as bad, if not worse, than the reviews written for this hotel at the end of 2011.

Two queens beds and a small pullout sofa. However, my son pulled back the comforter to check the sheets and they were actually stained with something red (blood perhaps)? Of course he immediatly thought of bed bugs. To me, it seemed like it was an old stain that just didnt come out of the wash. But either way, it should not have been in use. We then checked the pullout sofa for linens and didnt find any. I called the desk to see if we could get some and was told \"Well, if it doesnt have them, then its probably broken\" Sure enough, we checked and the bed was broken. So no using that! The room had the bare minimums for sure. No frills or extras (such as mini fridge or microwave). Didn't even have a closet (they did provide something on the wall to hang clothes). No issues with the bathroom.....plenty of hot water. The location does include a hot breakfast which is actually done by the local bar and restaurant next door. Nothing fancy, but again adequate. Options included blueberry muffins, breakfast potatoes, two kinds of eggs (looked scary though), waffels, biscuits and gravy (most people who had these said they were very good) and cereal. Good coffee and juice as well. I would say a bit better than some hotel free breakfasts. Location of the hotel is across the street from some dining options if you want to walk to get some food. Not sure if I would go back to this place if we go back to Branson. There are MANY motel style options to choose from and even a full scale Hilton that we may look into next time we go.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Joseph, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGood motel to stay at.\u201d", "Author": "nicole g", "ReviewID": "UR120847375", "Content": "Our room was very clean and quiet.

It is an aging hotel and the furniture and carpet are showing their age. However, the room was clean and large (king bed and sofa). The bed was very comfortable. The staff were courteous and friendly (World Series weekend, and the staff were really excited). The buffet breakfast in the restaurant (read non-smoking) part of the Rowdy Beaver was excellent even tho they were running low on food near the end of serving time.

Had two rooms for two couples. Booked through Discover Branson so wouldn't suggest using them either. (Believe their desk is actually set up in the Ramada Inn Lobby, so no wonder they booked us there!) Both rooms looked nice at first glance, but they both had spiders crawling on floor and up the walls, and even in the jacuzzi. There was also dead bugs and rolly pollies in window sills around edges of the room. The dresser in our room was missing handles and the bottom two drawers were falling out. Called office about the spiders - said they would send someone to spray. Didn't, so I called manager's extension. Kid showed up and sprayed. Woke up during the night with a big furry spider crawling up my arm. Complained at the office the next day. Asked if we could get our money back if we found someplace else to stay (July 4 weekend). Girl couldn't make that decision. I told her we would be out for the day, so if she would just have the rooms sprayed again and thoroughly cleaned, we would stay. Got back to the room about 8:30 that night. Room had not been cleaned, so I imagine it was never sprayed either. Complained again. They sent the same kid down with a vacuum cleaner to vacuum the carpet. I instructed him in order to get more done than he was going to do. My husband wouldn't let him spray since we were in the room to stay for the night and the spray took our breath away the first night. Never did try the jacuzzi - as my friend said...no better than the rooms were cleaned, wasn't sure we wouldn't have been sitting on someone else's dirt/bacteria/germs. Like one of the other reviews, was not impressed with breakfast. Dining area too small for the number of people. Red jello all over the buffet, so it ended up on my friend's new blouse when she got too close while reaching for some food. Ran out of plates, so part of us had to wait. Bus girl (who seemed to be the jack of all trades) took up what available space there was with her cart. Have visited Branson probably 20 times in the last 20 to 25 years.
