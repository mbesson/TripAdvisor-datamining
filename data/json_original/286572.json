This is our first time staying in a hotel that wasn't in \"Venice proper.\" Water buses were a little tricky out here to Giudecca at first (having been to Venice several times before we thought we could \"improvise\" with the water buses, bad idea), but once you know the right buses to take, it is easy. Unlike the main island of Venice, where all the touristy stuff is, Giudecca is a neighborhood with real people, the locals who grew up in and live in Venice. And it is so quiet here, unlke the main island. We were there for three days and nights and the only thing I heard outside our window was a boat going by, and only that one time. Air conditioning was a godsend, plumbing was great, lots of hot water, but it took a few minutes to come up. The shower stall was tiny, so large folks may have a problem. The hotel has an elevator, simply unheard of in small hotels in Venice, so this is great for luggage and for people who are physically challenged. The breakfast was awesome, lots of things to chose from. I am a tea drinker, and I only had to order my breakfast tea once, and the lady managing the breakfast room remembered that and remembered me and, bless her heart, she had my tea piping hot, on my table almost before I sat down. She must surely be a mind reader! People didn't much like the coffee machine in the breakfast room, from what I could overhear from the other guests. My tea, though, was delicious and perfect each morning. I would make a trip back to Venice just to stay in this hotel. I very highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFantastic find in Venice\u201d", "Author": "Derby17", "ReviewID": "UR119961429", "Content": "Hotel is very modern and contemporary in design.

My wife had stayed there some 8 years ago and recommended it and now I can endorse that view. It is far and away the best 3 star hotel I have stayed in. The rooms are modern, well designed and well maintained and the staff excellent; genuinely friendly and helpful. Breakfast is continental (cereal, croissants, fruit, ham coffee etc) rather than cooked. There is no restaurant in the hotel but there are several within 10 minutes walk. If you haven't been to Venice before, don't be put off by the fact that the Domina Home is not on the main island's of the town's centre. In fact, it's location on Giudecca is an advantage as we found it very quiet with restaurants nearby that are a little cheaper (and more honest) than those in the centre. You can reach the hotel easily from Marco Polo airport by Blue Line waterbus to Zattere then take the Line 2 east bound to Palanca (about 3 minutes across the canal). The Domina Home is about 5 minutes walk (left from the waterbus stop, over the bridge, 1st or 2nd right down the narrow alley).", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry but I cannot recommend this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Peder M", "ReviewID": "UR119652159", "Content": "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry but I cannot recommend this hotel.

Fun to watch when passing by and gave a very local feel quite different from the main island. Giudecca itself is rather limited for restauarants and a couple are quite pricey for what you get. My peference was the Trattoria al Cacciatorri. However, note that these waterside restaurants have little in the way of architectural delights to set them off and when busy they can appear rushed.

Print these directions out and take it with you and i guarantee you won't get lost. Apart rom that my top tips would be to dine around the Palanca Vaporetto stop. The restaurants are lovely and cheaper than in Venice and you can enjoy having the perspective of looking back on the city from the other side.

The way I would give directions is to get off the waterbus at Palanca, stepping off the dock turn left (East) along the promenade and walk about one hundred yards until you cross a little bridge. As soon as you have crossed the bridge look for narrow allyway on your right. Go down this alleyway and you come to an open courtyard with an old well in the middle. Continue across the courtyard and you will see the Hotel entance on your right. Hopefully there will also be a sign standing on the pavement outside to help you find the door.

We arrived on a Ryanair flight from Stansted mid afternoon, following a two hour flight delay and were understandably a little tired! Having never visited Venice before- we selected to fly into Treviso airport and were a little suprised at the distance from Venice itself, being approximately an hour away. The options for travel to the hotel were either a private water taxi, provided by the hotel at a cost of 70 Euros (one way!!) or a coach to Plaza la Roma and a water bus from there. The latter is far more stressful amd takes a very long time but only costs 11 Euros each- significantly cheaper! We decided upon the cheaper option! A single fare on the coach is 5 Euros each but a return is 9 Euros- so makes sense to do that! Also buy the ticket before you leave the Airport as they don't sell them on the coach and we missed the first coach as we hadn't realised that! The coach ride was air conditioned and comfortable so not bad at all! Upon arrival at Plaza la Roma, we boarded a water bus which was the number 82 to Palanca (the nearest stop to the hotel). There are numerous options for tickets but the cheapest way is to buy one for the duration we were there- wish we had realised that at the beginning!! And a 72 hour ticket costs 30 Euros, a 48 hour costs 25 Euros and a 24 hour 15 Euros. There is also the option of a single fare which is only 6 Euros- but lasts for 12 hours. You can also buy these at the Tabac stores (there is one by the Palanca stop) and I am told these are cheaper- but didn't find this out until I got back! I have read many reviews on bus routes but we used the 82 in all directions and it was the most direct and easiest. You can also buy single tickets from the guys on the boat but don't forget once you get on as the signs warned of hefty fines. We were only asked to show our tickets once though and that was on the way out- little suprising since we used the service about 20 times! When you arrive at the Palanca you need to turn left off the jetty and head towards a little bridge that you will see ahead, walk over the bridge and there is a little alley way almost immediately on your right hand side. It's very narrow so be careful with suitcases or large umbrellas! Walk right to the end and up ahead you will see another little bridge. The Domina is the last door on the right and there should be a little sign outside the door telling you you are in the right place! The receptionist was initially very welcoming and we were allocated room 12. Following reading a review of the hotel we were warned that room 12 was not recommended due to its proximity to the bar and reception and became quite noisy at times. We returned to reception to explain and ask if there were any other rooms available- and the receptionist became quite snotty and wouldn't even look me in the eye. I don't have the loudest of voices and my boyfriend told me afterwards that he could hear everything we said- word perfectly so it was certainly the right decision to move! We ended up in room 9 after a lot of faffing about! The rooms are ALOT smaller than you would expect but modern, clean and well furnished. The bathroom was a good size with a fabulous shower and you a provided with a great selection of little toiletries, bath robes and slippers! In room facilities included an lcd tv and wireless keyboard for internet access. Be warned though EVERYthing on telly is italian (as you'd expect!), I think we were a little naive in hoping somehting would be in English and next time I think I would bring a laptop and some dvds so as to relax comfortably after a long day marching around the streets of Venice! Breakfast was basic but nice, a selection of breads, cold meat, cheese, yoghurt, cereal and juices are provided. A good start to the day! Overall we had a good trip but found it to be very expensive (We spent about \u00c2\u00a3400 between us, just on food and travel around Venice and we didn't even buy anything!

The going rate for water taxi service is 90.00 EURO per hour in Venic, the hotel staff insists on booking taxis for you and charging 120.00 EURO per hour. During my stay we booked a taxi for 4-6 hour excursion, and were told by the staff that it was 120.00 per hour and a minimum of 6 hours (and had to be paid in cash), when the taxi arrived he stated that it should have been 90.00 per hour and that there was no minimum hourly charge (he owned his own taxi). We decided to book this same taxi driver directly for our departure the next day for 60 EURO, and in the morning the staff called 30 minutes before to tell us that our driver cancelled and that they would find a new taxi for me - but it would be 90 EURO in cash. This was not true, as our taxi arrived on time and said he never called to cancel. I contacted the Domina hotel chain after I returned from Italy and demanded my money back, which they agreed to do - which shows me that this is not the first time they have done this to their guests, nor will it be the last until the management is replaced. Be warned if you stay here not to trust the management staff!", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel shame about the reception\u201d", "Author": "Abyron", "ReviewID": "UR5937742", "Content": "The directions i printed from a previous travel advisor enabled us to find the hotel without a problem, so i would advise to do the same because it is hidden away. The rooms are clean and good value for money although there double bed was actualy two pushed together. We didnt find the fact it was on a seperate Island to much of a hindrance although at times it would have been nice just to walk back to the hotel it was good to see how the natives live. The breakfast on the first day was pretty much none existent, after that we presumed someone had complained and the following two were fine. Our only real fault with the hotel was the staff on reception. when we first arrived we were greeted by a chap who barely bothered to look at us, when we asked a question the best we could get out of him was yes and no answers. the second day when we asked him to book a restraunt he told us to do it from our room, when this didnt work we called him and when we told him the problem he huffed and put the phone down. Fortunatly we are a very laid back couple and didnt really let this get to us but it did make us feel very unwelcome. Saying that though Venice is a wonderfull place and im sure wherever you stay you will have a cracking time. enjoy!!", "Date": "October 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff", "Title": "\u201cNo compliants!\u201d", "Author": "N.Davies", "ReviewID": "UR5834130", "Content": "A good hotel.
