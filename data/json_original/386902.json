The hotel is being refurbished and therefore the reception and breakfast dining has had to be moved to a much smaller annex so room was a bit tight for breakfast. Continental style breakfast but a reasonable choice and excellent value for money. The staff were superb, especially the catering staff supplying breakfast. Reception staff was really good and their spoken english was excellent which is very helpful to ignorant people like me who won't learn other languages. We payed \u00a329 per person per night including tourist tax and breakfast for a hotel very close to the Colosseum, clean rooms with ensuite bathroom but a tad on the small side is all. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, whether the price will increase when the refurb is completed I can't comment on. We flew with Lufthansa with a short stopover in Frankfurt, flying from Heathrow - they were excellent, good legroom (I am 6 foot 2 inches tall) and plenty of seat width and the seat belt still had a good 8 inches \"spare\" with my 44 inch waist, superb. The hotel also arranged for a taxi to pick us up from the Airport (Flumincio) which was 50 euros but was a 9 seater taxi so we thought it was good value, the journey is about 40 minutes and is a pain by train or bus/coach as we have done that before.

Breakfast: The breakfast was served from 7.30 to 9.30 I think. The breakfast was good, with rolls, cheese, ham, salami, yam, yoghurt, cereals, juice and a small coffee-bar. The selection of croissants and cakes was enormous. The service was impeccable. Internet: The hotel did not have wireless internet, but had a computer in the breakfast area with internet connection. Fifteen minutes a day for each room was free, and you had to pay for access exceeding that. I think they wanted 2\u20ac for half an hour or something. Service: The reception was staffed 24 hours a day, and the service was good, and the reception staff spoke well English. Check-out time was 10.00. We had a nice stay and could recommend this hotel to other travellers. We didn't check very much around, so I can't say how the price is for a hotel in Rome, but I think it has an OK price.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cDepressing\u201d", "Author": "Jacarandar", "ReviewID": "UR44330488", "Content": "While this hotel is very cheap and in a central location, if this is all you can afford then stay home until you have saved more money.", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haarlem", "Title": "\u201cGreat breakfast\u201d", "Author": "FonzieHaarlem", "ReviewID": "UR43351267", "Content": "Behind the busy street Via Nazionale we have found a great (not to big) bed and breakfast hotel.

I guessed i'd try it based on my budget and giving the benefit of the doubt to the hotel. Mistake. Unlike other reviews the hotel isn't a '10 min walk' from the Termini Station, it's closer to 20 minutes. The location definitely is it's strong point though, being a few minutes walk from the Metro and a 5-10 minute stroll to the Colloseum. Despite this and the fact that the Receptionist was very helpful & friendly, my girlfriend and i moved out after just one night. The room we were given was on the top (5th) floor and was the 'Poppea' room adjacent to the 'Cleopatra' room. The Poppea bedroom is so small it doesn't have a bathroom within it, you have to go across a landing to your own separate facilitiies. A bit strange but nothing too bad. But the fact that the walls were so thin you could virtually hear everything from seemingly the floor below, not just next door, was what initiated my desire to move. I failed to get to sleep until approx 1:30am due to other guests noise. The main reason though for moving out was the ANTS. Yep, i noticed about three ants on the bedroom floor before going to bed but thought nothing of it. In the morning i awoke to what can be best described as scene from a wildlife documentary. This may sound like i'm trying to create dramatic effect here but i am totally honest when i say they were streaming along the floor by the wall from the door to window. They'd managed to form some sort of mini colony around our belongings on the floor. Luckily only the odd one had gotten into the bag or clothings. But as you lifted things off the floor you were left with a black outline of the item on the floor made up of small ants. I followed the 'trail' and it seemed to end in our room but originate from the 'Cleopatra' room next to us as they filed under the bedroom doors. I obviously can't claim to judge the rest of the hotel's rooms (or the breakfast area for that matter!) but i felt it only fair to warn people of what they may be sharing their room with on the top floor. It's unfortunate that i write this review as the receptionist (manageress?) was most apologetic and understanding stating the rooms were cleaned just the previous day and claimed not to have had this complaint before.

It is a 5 minute walk to the Colosseum, it's in a good area and near the subway. If you have reasonable expectations then you shouldn't be disappointed in this hotel. The staff was very friendly, although some of them had the typical Italian attitude where it seems like you're bothering them. The good: Very clean. This is my most important criteria. The only thing I noticed was that the floor was a bit dusty (there are no carpets). The room wasn't large but it was more than adequate for one couple and three pieces of luggage. Security: You have to be buzzed in. Breakfast: Lots of croissants (with or without jam/nutella), cereal, milk, pie, cheese, yogurt and more. The staff asked us what we wanted to drink every day, promptly. I always had a cappuccino. Location: Best price/location ratio I found. Service: We only had one pillow each, which is unfortunate, so we used the extra covers under the pillows to give us some lift. The maid must have noticed this and left 2 extra pillows the next day. The surroundings: A lot of good places around. I loved the Gran Cafe at the brazilian coffee shop across the street. I loved the ice cream at the gelato store across the street. I loved the prosciutto at the calabresi deli across the street. You get the picture. The Bad: Paper thin walls: You can hear everything in the hallway/everyone in the hallway can hear you. If you're planning on sleeping in past 7:30am this may be very bad. I didn't have any problem even though I was on the first floor as I woke up early every day. I didn't hear anything from the other rooms. Double bed was actually two twin beds. This was very annoying and we weren't told that was the case. I actually emailed the hotel in advance to ask if it was a double bed and was told yes. Apparently this is common in Italy (My parents had the same thing happen to them over 30 years ago on their honeymoon!) Temperature: The temperature in the room was fine but the hallway was very cold since there is no actual door to the outside, just a gate. Safety: One night we couldn't get to our room because there was a large (fire?) door blocking our way on the first floor. There was no way to open it as it was electronically locked via the front desk. There didn't seem to be any way to open the door from either side. The man at the front desk seemed surprised that it was closed and locked. If this happened and a fire occurred I don't see anyway to get out of the building. This made me VERY uneasy. Wake up Calls: On our last night I was offered a wakeup call because my plane was scheduled for 8am. I used my own alarm as well and thank god because the wake up call never came. I went downstairs to see if my taxi had arrived and the employee was sleeping on the chairs in the front room. Lesson: Always bring your own alarm! Don't let the negatives fool you, overall I liked the place and I liked the price too. Obviously this isn't a 4 star place but if you know that going in you shouldn't be disappointed.", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cClose to Roman ruins, but bathroom issues\u201d", "Author": "young_dazza", "ReviewID": "UR13950450", "Content": "Stayed here for four nights.

The train station is another 7-10 walk from the hotel ROOM: Clean overall, especially the shower. however you can tell the maids are not completely thoughrough cleaning the floors in the corners and under beds (see pics). the rooms are small but comfortable. The tv is tiny and doesnt have good reception. There was a mini fridge in the room, which was convenient. HOTEL: doesnt really have a \"hotel\" feeling. It's more like your Italian aunt's bording house atmosphere. There is a separate entrance to the lobby and to to rooms. THe staircase to the rooms is a little dark and shady looking. BREAKFAST: just your basic, nothing extraordinary by any means. there is juice, coffee, cereal, croissants, maybe pasteries and bananas. SERVICE: pretty friendly, we didnt have any negative experiences. the staff speak english pretty well so its convenient to get info/directions, etc. OVERALL: normally i would say that the price was rip off based on what the hotel had to offer, but it being Rome these kind of prices are to be expected. it was good overall. next time i would try to find a better hotel and try to book way way in advance to have a better selection.", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cFab Flavio\u201d", "Author": "LiverpoolLaw", "ReviewID": "UR12785423", "Content": "Booked the hotel online for a really reasonable rate and was slightly worried about what to expect! but we shouldn't have been!!

It worked just fine for us during our entire stay. Our room had two windows on adjacent walls which opened onto an interior court. This eliminated most street noise and provided for good cross ventilation during mild evenings. During warmer weather, we found the air-conditioner effective and quiet. The room was clean and adequately furnished. It even included a third single bed which we used for our luggage.

Saftey deposit box was included as was air conditioning. Bed was comfy. Beds were made up daily and towles changed every 2 days.

ROME Use the red bus tours,, great for seeing the whole city. Get up early as most tourists dont,we were in some places by 9am and had no waits etc, visit the Vatiguan on a Friday if possible - less busy or go late in the day to avoid long waits. Or pay for a guided tour as the price includes entry avoiding the long long waits (about 4+ hours) - it costs more but will save you time. (use Romaround tours [--]) Watch your bags at all time (especially when you are at the tourist sights) - my bag was opened whilst posing with gladiators, they offer to pose with you but will rob you!! Luckily for me my bag only contained water and guide book. Water is free and clean in Rome,,,, buy a water bottle,, once empty keep it as water is available at all fountains around the city it is fresh spring water,, we simply filled up regually. Take a guided tour of the coleseum, this gives you free pass to the Paletine and a tour which is very good & informative. We used romearound tours.

There was a foul odor emanating from the bathroom. Although we complained to the front desk, they did not do anything about it (perhaps they couldn't and it was just old plumbing). This necessitated keeping the bathroom door closed at all times. There was an air conditioner but the fan blew directly on one of the beds that was located in the smaller portion of the L shaped room so it was difficult to keep the room cool. The room was basically clean although far from spotless. The hallways and entrance to the hotel were not clean. The included breakfast was good - bread, pastries, cereal, yogurt, etc. Overall the staff were helpful and friendly. Directly across the street is a great gelato place - among the best we had anywhere in Italy (and it felt as if we tried them all!). About a block down the street (towards the Colosseum) was a small piazza with a fountain that was a local hangout. We enjoyed relaxing there and watching the children play. The location of the hotel was good and permitted us to walk most places. It was close to the subway which we used quite a bit too.

This was not the best expreience considering we had been in Rome less than an hour. The hotel is very small but i thought it was just right. I think 3 or 4 days is the right amount to stay here as there is no hotel entertainment or bar. Its perfect for staying while you are sightseeing, and as Rome is a large place after a whole day of walking its a perfect place to relax. All the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a large choice of breakfast too. I found the restraurants around the tourist attractions to be overpriced and bland. If you walk a few blocks from any attraction it gets cheaper. There is the best ice cream shop in the world just opposite the hotel with hundreds of different flavours, i definatily recommend you to try one!

The room was fitted out with airconditioning and heaters, fridge, tv, safe and the bathroom had hot running water and was very clean. This hotel is in a fantastic location and you can literally see the colloseum right up the main street - it is within a easy walking distance and was a wonderful starting point to explore all of historic rome. Travelling to the vatican was also very easy - you just catch the 64 bus from a stop which is a very short distance away - the receptionists will be able to assist. The metro stop Cavour is about a 5 minute walk away - however you will not need to take it as everything is within walking distance - the only time we travelled by train is to get to/from termini station to get back to the airport by shuttlebus. I booked through expedia with no breakfast included, however the staff insisted we take the hotel breakfast with no extra charge which was greatly appreciated. Breakfast consisted of an assortment of croissants with fillings, coffee and yoghurt. The staff are happy to hold onto your bags after check out, however I would recommend having some locks readily available as they are left in the lobby (however under close watch). There are a great selection of restaurants nearby - we tried a restaurant called \"WANTED\" which was near the main intersection, and the food was to die for. Try any of their pizzas, and their gnocchi was fantastic (authentic stuff too - 3 mega sized dumplings, not the small western variety). The gelati store \"Il Gelatone\" directly opposite the hotel is also a gem and has a huge selection of gelati and is open until really late at night - should you get any icecream cravings towards midnight, you know where to go! Make sure you try their blood orange flavored gelati.

I was VERY disappointed. My 17 year old daughter and I stayed at this B&B during Holy week 2007. We were booked in a triple room because my 16 year old son was also supposed to travel however his passport never came so he stayed home for this trip. Before leaving the USA, I requested a double room but the B&B staff said that they could not change the reservation. We arrived on a Friday night after our private car (50E) picked us up at the airport. The B&B arranged the car service and it was clean and efficient. The driver spoke very little English but he was polite and waiting as promised even though the flight was a little late. When we checked in to our room, we were given the Nerva room on the 3rd floor in the front of the building. The odor in the bathroom was overwhelming!! The smell of sewer was so strong that we had to immediately open the window and attempt to get some fresh air. The remote for the TV did not work and there were blown light bulbs. Other than that, the room was clean. Friday night I asked the desk staff to fix the TV and the lights. She said she did not have maintenance staff on the weekends but would see if house cleaning staff could do anything in the morning. Saturday morning the smell from the bathroom made me sick. I asked to move rooms and they said the manager was the only one who could move rooms and there was no manager on the weekend. They left me air freshener spray. Saturday night the street was LOUD and I was unable to get to sleep until about 3:00 am. Sunday morning I asked to be moved again and was again told I could only be moved by a manager and to check on Monday. I again told them how bad the smell was from the bathroom and they said there was nothing they could do. Sunday night my neighbors returned about 1am and proceeded to have loud relations. I asked the front desk staff to move me again. They said they could not. Monday I did not speak to the Manager as I had a tour to attend at St. Peters and did not have time. Tuesday morning when I finally spoke to a manager, she insisted that I had not complained at the right time of day to be moved and that if I had complained at the right time, I could have been moved. She gave me two keys to check on two empty rooms. I picked Constantino on the fourth floor. It was a TRUE improvement over Nerva. We changed rooms. The smell was gone. The room was quiet and we had a wonderful bathtub. I wish the staff had been more responsive when I complained multiple times. They seemed to have no idea how to handle any of my complaints. The manager did give me a discount on my room from 170E (which I booked at 165E) to 160E per night. Overall I would never recommend this B&B to anyone.

We stayed in room Severo on the fourth floor (maybe those with good reviews had better quality rooms?!). It was incredibly basic and poorly decorated (yellowy smoke stained walls). Shower doors were falling off, bathroom lights kept failing, remote control on tv didnt work (not great when tv is positioned very high up in the corner of the room) and the noise in this hotel is unbearable. You can hear absoultely everything going on in the adjacent rooms, including all the ups and downs of marital life if you catch my drift. Everytime someone flushes a toilet, the noise is unbearable and wakes you up if you are asleep - there seems to be a common flushing system between the rooms. The noise outside is also very loud, especially on Friday and Saturday nights when the local kids hang out outside until the early hours of the morning. The double bed is 2 singles pushed together, so not the best and it was cold in March, with only a thin blanket to keep you warm at night. There are no provisions for a fire escape route (although this could be an Italy thing), and the staircase was dangerous - uneven stairs and unfinished handrails (I managed to get a huge splinter in my finger from them). If you are looking for a very basic hotel, then this is for you, but it certainly is not value for money for a basic hotel - 100 Euros/night.

The windows also have external shutters, so during our stay (February), it was nice to leave the windows open and the shutters closed to get both privacy and fresh cool air (temperatures ranged from 40-60 F). The bathroom shower stall was bigger than the other hotel we stayed in on this trip. Food: The included continental breakfast was pastry, a roll, choice of hot beverage (cappucino, hot choc, tea), nutella, fruit drink, yogurt. We found it enough to start the day. Area: The Cavour Metro station is just a 5 minute walk, and the #117 bus line stops in front of the hotel. There are oodles of places to eat nearby, and some specialty shops.

We booked with lastminute and prebooked a taxi with the hotel via email (see their own website) from Learnado De Vinci Airport for E50. This went so smoothly, and the driver even stopped the car to let us take photos on our way in, that we also booked our taxi for the way back. Taxi journey from LDV airport to hotel was about 35mins. Arrived at the hotel and was delighted to see so many resteraunts within 2min walk of the hotel as well as a fantstic view of the coloseum from the road! Check in at the hotel was a breeze, we were promptly given our room key. Note: most hotels do take your passport upon check in, but there is a room safe, and if like me and my friend, you are under 26 and you show your passport (or driving license), then you get discounted entrance to many of the sites including the colosseum (E6.50 instead of E11) and the Vatican museum (E11.50) along with many others. For 2 people, we had the Nerva room on the 3rd floor with a double bed and a single bed (v.clean!). There was one lift, however it was small and meant for 2 people, with 2 small luggages (so ok for us). Not really a problem if youre on the lower floors though (went upto level 5). Room size was good, there was room to fit our luggage on the side and walk around the beds. We had a dressing table and chair, and 2 sets of cupborads with hangers for clothes. There was also a safe (the key is attached to the room key so impossible to lose!) and a fridge in the room. Our room overlooked the main Via Di Serpenti Rd, which wasnt too noisy with the windows open, and dead silent with the windows closed. The bathroom was a good size, super clean! There was the usual sink, shower, toilet and little bidet. Only problem we had was the water draining a little slow in the shower, but other than that, no probs. Oo, they do provide towels, but they are not what i am customed to- i.e. they were more thin tea-towel thickness than normal home-towel thick, so i would suggest you take one along if you are like me. There was complimentary shower gel and shampoo/conditioner and soap (no toothpaste so bring your own). Also out of the 3 nights we were there, cleaner came twice and restocked. Shopping: we went mainly for the 2 main roads: via del corso and via di nazionale, both within walking distance (i.e. 1-10min walk). Dont be put off by pricier tags on shop displays, some of the shops have real cheap gems if you are willing to give it a try! They have the usual name branded shops, e.g. as well as Armani, prada, gucci, CK, Nike, Adidas, they had Zara and united colours of benetton as well as several italian shops. For souveneir shops, there arnt really shops per se. In fact, we found the small stands around major sites best for souveniers. The cheapest area for souveniers was the piazza between St Peters (stunning, and free entry) and the Vatican museums (moderate charge) with magnets costing approx. 3euros and statues starting from 2euros. Sights: this is where rome hurts you. On the feet! There are many sights we saw, all within walking distance of each other. The exception was the vatican city for which we took the metro (1euro for a single journey- tickets are bought in the station from a machine which is in italian or english- so keep change on you!). The main sights to see are: Colosseum (entry fee), Roman Forum (free), Palatino (included in coloseum price, but to be honest, not worth it if you are without a tour guide here as its so easy to get lost!), Vatican city, pantheon, Trevi fountain, Spanish steps and Castel Sant Angelo (5euro entry) to name a few. There is piazza navona, which we thought we could get away with visiting in the daytime, but to be honest, it doesnt come alive until the evening. Warnings: do try to keep your wits about you especially when it comes to poor people with babies who sometimes try to steal from you. We did not have a problem, but it appeared that they went after oriental people more, e.g. by pick pocketing. I am not trying to scare you, because we did not really see this, but we did hear about it so just passing it on: Take care of your essentials especially at main attractions, and you will be ok! Food: Overall, as vegetarians, we had no problem with food whatsoever. The free breakfast in the hotel was served in the basement from 7.30am to 9.30am. Food offered included yoghurt, danishes and pastries, cereals, dried toast, rolls and tea/coffee or red orange juice. Italy are not big on their Teas so if you cant stand the thought of no tea or bad tea, take your own tea bags!!! The coffee on the ohter hand, is divine no matter where you go!! For dinner, we tried Mother India (left of the hotel) which was superb! 2 courses and glass of wine/water was approx 9euros each. We also tried an italian resteraunt on the right side of the hotel where the pizza was lovely. I had margherita, mixed salad and a coke for only 8euros! We also ate at an italian on the top of via nazionale which had yummy pasta! Note: if you ask for red peppers, they add chillies! They dont really tend to have red or green peppers as we do in london or if they do, they dont call it peppers! Coz to them peppers=chilli=hot hot hot! Note: DO try teh gelataria across the hotel. The icecream is not to be missed! I had a cookies n vanilla icecream, smallest pot (equivalent of 2 scoops) for 1.50euros which was the right portion (my standards!) and pure heaven. My firend had a mint choc icecream and it was sooo fresh and lovely too. They actually used real mint leaves and not additives!! Spending: We went fro 3 nights, and took about 200euros spending per person for general eating/drinking, taxi one way and light shopping. It was enough, but if you run short, there are ATMS all over the city, and not too far from the hotel - not that we were ever in there long enough other than to sleep!!

Daily, the receptionist would nod his/her head, speak in English, and still nothing was done other than the maid leaving the windows wide open while we were gone during the day. I know this is not a new problem to them since I've read this complaint a few times at least on this site but obviously nothing has been done. Also the walls and doors are thin so during the nite you will hear the front door, the elevator, and whoever is in the hallway very clearly as if you had the door wide open. We stayed on the second floor facing the street. The location is great, the hotel is clean, the quad was a great size, the gelato shop across the street is great, and the price is decent. The breakfast is average, small assortment of pastry and yogurt, and I really enjoyed my daily cappucino.

The only complaint that I had was that when we checked in the room was not ready (which we knew as we were arriving early) so we left our bags in the foyer for several hours. When we returned we were surprised to see the bags still in the foyer left unattended. In North America the bags would have been taken upstairs when the rooms became vacant. My only other comment relates to the open bus tour. The receptionist gave us incorrect information and sold us two tickets. It was a disaster (take the red bus it runs every 5 minutes, the open bus runs every hour despite the information provided at the hotel). WHen we returned we complained and was advised that they would contact the bus company and get back to us. We heard nothing else. Overall this was a wonderful hotel that I would strongly recommend.

I booked the flight and the hotel just a week before. Actually, I was intending to spend about 100 Euro per night for the room, but the cheaper bed&breakfast location in the center were fully booked, already. So was happy to get a room at the \"Anfiteatro Flavio\". We got a room in the 4th floor. Luckyly, there is an elevator in the hotel. It's a very small one so you won't use it if you suffer from claustrophobia *g*, but it's really helpful to get you luggage up to your room. Our room was small, but sufficient and well equipped: With air condition (well, we don't used it), a safe (included, no extra fee), a tv (well, who will watch tv in rom? The channels are all in italian, anyway) and even a small refrigerator. The floor has no carpet, but floor tiles which I liked a lot (better hygiene). The room was also clean. Well, unless you have a look under the bed. The bed: we slept well. The bath was fine. The shower hat a solid cabin (not one of these awful curtains) and there was ever enough hot water. The bath also had a bidet. The bath would have been perfect if the sprinkler of the shower would not have been broken (unable to fix it at the wall) and if the cabin itself would'nt have been a little bit defect (it was however working perfectly). The \"Anfiteatro Flavio\" is in the center of room. And although the Via dei Serpenti is a small one-way street, it's a rather busy one with a lot of traffic. And italians love to use the signal horn. So, you either need be really tired to get asleep or just close the windows. The windows have double panes and really keep all the noise out. After lecture of my rom travel guide (\"forget the breakfast in the hotels, get to a coffee shop\"), I had no expectations regarding the breakfast. Well, ok, don't expect ham&sausages, scrambled or boiled eggs etc. pp. - Which one might expect looking at the price of the room. Such a breakfast seems to be quite unusual in Italy. You however get biscuits and jam or honey, good coffee or capucino, a yogurt, cornflags and fruit juice. So, the breakfast really was better than expected. Last, but not least I'd like to mention that the personal was very friendly and helpful. And the personal at the reception speaks english. I used a taxi to get from ciampino airport to the hotel and was tricked by the driver: The meter was off during the drive and he finally requested 68 Euro, about twice as much as expected. However, the hotel managed to get the taxi company to pay 25 euro back. Great service! On the other hand: The hotel requests 50 Euro for arranging the transport to the airport... I really enjoyed my stay in Rom. The \"Anfiteatro Flavio\" is located in the center of Rome and we just walked to the common places. The price for the room was rather high. But I guess it's just common in Rome.

The Vatican is a must and dont miss the walk up the steps to the top of St Peters Basillica.

At 1.50am, after nearly 2 hours of shouting, banging, calling and sitting outside on the verge, he finally woke up. This was not a good end to our holiday, especially having to get up early to catch a flight. And had we not paid the day before we left, we would have demanded a discount. Other than that, a pleasant stay!!", "Date": "September 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bromley, Kent", "Title": "\u201cA very distressing hotel experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3789731", "Content": "After an eveing flight the first thing we wanted to do was to get to the hotel and rest. At the hotel we were shown a room down stairs that can only be described as a broom cupboard. There was no window, it stunk and there was no door leading to the bathroom. Going back to reception and saying that we hadn't paid for that room we had spent a lot of money and were promised what we had seen on the internet the receptionist then told us basically that there was nothing they could do and we had no room. After discussing the matter for an hour and speaking with the manager they put us up in a local hotel only because we stood up for our rights-by this time it's 11'0clock at night-were walking through Rome and we had to carry our own luggage. The next morning we had to come back at 11'oclock to get the room we had orignally booked. It appears to us the hotel management have this system so if they have a paying customer in the hotel for that night they can take extra money and they don't care about the customers that are distressed as they have overbooked. The reception staff were extremely rude, basically unhelpful-they didn't make us feel welcome and tended to be smoking our on their mobiles for personal calls or. When we did get our room eventually, we were shown a space that contained 3 singles beds and not the double we had booked, the singles were then put to together with a gap down the middle to make a double which gave back ache and the remaining single became a sofa and took up alot of space. The make-shift wafrdrobe was far too small for 2 people. The room was very dusty and floor seemed as though it had never been cleaned. The Breakfast Area was located near the broom cupboard room and there was a general space being used as what can only be described as a general rubbish tip. Matresses and there bases were left there to be built. The marjority of the time you had to wait -10 minutes to be seated for breakfast as the area was too small for the amount of guests they were ripping off. The breakfast menu was never changed and after 8 days can be become slightly tedious. The icing on the cake was the constant drilling and hammering noises of hotels maintance work which seems absolutely ricidulous for the busiest time of the year. We both had a wonderful time in Rome and enjoyed our holiday despite this disressing and upsetting hotel environment. We would both reccommend you to stay somewhere else.", "Date": "August 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat little bed and breakfast in central Rome\u201d", "Author": "marcol", "ReviewID": "UR3742166", "Content": "We found this hotel to be exactly as described on its web site. Good central location within walking distance of most tourist attractions.We had a small clean comfortable room and a bathroom that neatly fitted in.The breakfast lacked imagination but rolls, coffee, pastries and juice were laid out every day by two very friendly ladies and the breakfast area was pleasant and clean with cafe style tables. Reception staff were very helpful and approachable. If you're visiting Rome and looking for value for money, this is the place for you. TIPS: Take the 110 tourist open top bus to get your bearings then you will find that almost every attraction is within easy reach. Good value at 13.00 euros for an all day ticket. BEWARE: Pickpocket gangs, thieves and bag/purse snatchers operate continually on Metro and bus services, especially 64 bus from Termini to Vatican. These are professional criminals....don't be complacent.

We ended up with a room so small that we had to put our suitcases on a shelf above our bed, to get some livingspace.The room was certainly not redecorated since the 60-s. It was small, smelly, with a bad AC and a shower that kept dripping all day. The hallway leading to this room was filthy with an old carpet, and a closet with its doors hanging out. When I complained, the btw very friendly staff, they did not know what I meant, till I started speaking Italian, wich I can fairly. They promissed us a better room the next day, wich we got. It was better then the one we had, but certainly not the level shown on internet. The nayberhood is perfect, as the location is. But it has a very bad price/quality rate. I do not know how the pricelevel is for americans or other not Europeans, but for Dutch standards this was really not a cheap hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
