This Courtyard Marriott is typical of most Marriott middle range hotels. It's very clean and the staff are helpful and professional. The hotel is not Marriott's most contemporary design, but my room was functional with a flat screen TV and free wireless internet. and a balcony. The desk offered me a small welcome gift of bottled water and chocolate as I am a Marriott rewards member - basically nothing but it was nice. The front desk also helped me order in food from Doral pizza which was not bad. The shuttle service runs on a schedule to and from MIA about hourly - I called anyway when I arrived. I used the Whirlpool which was nice, and the gym which is super super small but has two treadmills, a bench with free weights to 50lbs and a bike. I did not get to use the pool because the staff were cleaning it at the time - it looked very nice. The one thing about this hotel is it's location to the runway... its almost hilarious how loud and close the aircraft come to the hotel when landing... I was going to ask for another room from the front desk however in the elevator on the way down I could still hear the aircraft screaming overhead. I did get a good sleep though so it was not such a big deal after all... if you or your kids are aeroplane buffs then this might be a cool place to stay...", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "ATLANTA, GA", "Title": "\u201cWill stay again\u201d", "Author": "Kdsolomon", "ReviewID": "UR124822449", "Content": "This courtyard was very convenient to find from the airport.

The downsides for me were many. The location of the property is very difficult to find and when you do find it, it is difficult to get to it. The location is costly because there are tolls associated with getting to it, if you don't know the none toll road way to get to it. I was fortunate that I lived in Miami for three years and knew the roadways very well. The fact that this property does not include any continental breakfast shocked me. There is a deli and coffee shop inside with plenty of seating. But the prices for food and drinks were a little high for my liking. One would think that since the property was far off the beaten path the management would offer some form of discount or reduce costs for patrons. As far as other issues with this property, the jacuzzi was not hot at all. It was mostly luke warm at best. The elevator was broken 2 of the 4 days I stayed. The maintenance of the building is lacking. The bright spot of the stay was the people at the front desk. They were very responsive to all issues but was unable to get them fixed. I guess the maintenance department needs new help.

My experience in this hotel was good, and I didn't give it 5 points just because I do believe they should updgrade the floors and carpets in the rooms and add a little more \"wow\" factor to the decoration, having said this, the rest of my experience for the 5 nights I stayed was pretty good. These are my observations: 1. The lobby and front area of the hotel is inviting, nicely decorated and has a lot of nice functional spaces to hold meetings with colleagues or other guests. 2. There is a station that has access to coffee to go and water with lime on that area that I found super convenient. 3. Most of the staff (not everyone) were friendly and helpful 4. The courtyard with the swimming pool was actually really nice and enjoyable both, at day or at night. 5. The rooms were really spacious and the beds are very comfortable. 6. The furniture on the rooms is actually really nice (except for the dated sofa) but there is a large HD TV and it is well layed out. 7. Closet space and drawer space are enough and convenient. 8. For me, Internet connectivity is really important, and this hotel had one of the best I have seen in a hotel so far, it was fast and simple. 9. Even when I got a room on the first floor due to my rate, the rooms were reasonably quiet (this is an airport hotel) On the not so great side of things: 1. The carpets need to go or to be changed 2. The decoration in some areas needs to be re-vamped. 3. The excercise room wasnt all that great 4. The breakfast buffett wasn't all that great, so, I ended up just once and went to Denny's (1 minute drive from the hotel) for Breakfast the rest of my time. So, in the end a pleasant experience, and it definitely surprased my initial expectations and I would recommend, specially when it helped me save over half of my bill.

As others have said, this Courtyard does not have the remodel that other Courtyards have. However, it has everything that you and your family could need. Breakfast buffet was outstanding and even included made to order eggs/ omelets for only $10 adult and $5 children. They have a free coffee station and also free computers to use in the lobby. The pool was clean and large for a Courtyard and had many lounge chairs to use. Our room was dated, but was clean and roomy. We had two queens in one room and a pull out sofa in the other room. Flat screen TVs, microwave, and mini-fridge were nice touches. The hotel staff were very nice and very helpful!! Ask them for the handout that lists all the nearby restaurants and attractions. Doral is one of the nicest areas of Miami, but you will need a car to get to most places. However, there are a few restaurants that you can easily walk to. Overall, we were pleased with this hotel.
