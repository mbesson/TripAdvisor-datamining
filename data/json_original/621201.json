{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Incredible Value My wife and I stayed here for 7 days in 2006 and though it was fantastic!The quality and comfort of this hotel was incredible despite the cheap price!The location was great - just a short walk from Shinjuku station.The receptionists were extremely friendly, even though they didn't speak much english.The rooms  bathrooms were quite small, but had everything we needed. They were also very quiet.There was a complimentary Japanese breakfast, which was very filling for busy days.Throughout our travels this hotel remains as one of the best we've ever stayed at.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR586611508", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "danm82"}, {"Content": "Great value and position The Toyoku Inn Shinjuku is part of a chain of essentialy business hotels all over Japan. quite basic but very clean and pleasant. this one is just out of the centre of Shinjuku about 10 mins walk from Shinjuku station .......other people have have mentioned that it is quite difficult yo find so here is a brief guide on how to find it. Leave the station( it is massive) on the central east exit when you exit the barrier look for a sign ..still in station saying Kabuchiko then when you exit into the square look across to the right diagonal corner you will see a shop called ABC Mart walk to that then left dowm to a large road turn right for about 100 yds and look across the other side of this very big road and you will see MISTER DONUT on the corner walk to that and then walk up that smaller road on which mister donut sits on the corner keep walking about 400 yds and if you look up to your left you should see the Toyoko Inn massive sign on the top of the building.I was travelling with my 14 yr old daughter and although this Hotel is situated on the edge of a red light district it is not a problem Japan is a very non threating place to travel and the people as they were in the hotel are almost painfully polite. The Shinjuku area has masses of shops and places to eat of all styles also because almost every underground line passes through Shinjuku station it make getting round Tokyo easy .", "Date": "Jul 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR929960748", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "humbert1"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Hotel This hotel was recommended to me by my Japanese friend who is frequently travelling around Japan and says that apparently the Toyoko Inn is considered to be the best budget accommodation in the land. I don't think many foreigners know much about this chain as it's not advertised on any of the touristy web sites like japan-guide.com etc. I have used this hotel in Hiroshima for the first time and it was perfect. I used it everywhere else in Japan since. The Shinjuku hotel is located 5 mins away from the Higashi-Shinjuku subway station. It's not hard to find it, as they have got a huge advert on the roof of their building which you can easily see from around the subway station. I felt that the area was a bit dodgy (japan dodgy) and found out that it was a Red District area. Saying that I was coming back to my hotel at around 3am that night and it was perfectly safe i thought ( like anywhere else in Tokyo).The staff was ok, and since they do not get many english speaking guests their English was not very good but good enough to check you in and out. There are 4 internet stands which are not heavily used. You also have a printer and a land line phone which you can use for free. The reception area is fairly big and you have all the usual vending machines, washing machines and dryers if you need them. My room was on the 7th floor with a fairly decent view of the skyscraper district. The room was bright, with a big double bed, tv, small storage space for your shirts, fridge and other accessories The room had the usual selection of books (Buddha teachings/ bible etc.). There was also a remote control for the air-conditioning/heating unit. The control was in Japanese so it was a bit of a challenge working out how to use it.The bathroom was of a decent size, with all the accessories and my favourite hi-tech toilet. The breakfast was also included in the price ( 7,140Yen with tax) and consisted of miso soup, some rice and pickled veg. Free tea and coffee are also provided. It is not you usual selection but i recommend you try it just for the experience.i checked out in the morning at around 7 am and caught the subway to Shinjuku-Nishiguchu station and walked(3 mins) to Shinjuku st to take the Narita Ex. to the airport which is very convenient.I would definitely stay in this hotel again in Tokyo or anywhere else.", "Date": "May 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR572941086", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "VagrantBoy"}, {"Content": "Clean, budget, good location business hotel       double sharing bed", "Date": "Nov 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR843487755", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "monophobia"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel At Fantastic Price My Fiancee and I stayed here in 2004. I was finding it very hard, and searched and searched the net for a few days to get good value accommodation for a reasonable price in Tokyo. Luckily i found Toyoko-Inn. Convenient and in a good location. Although we found out on the last day it was in a red light district, you would never have noticed it unless some one told you. In general Japan is one of the safest place i have visited if not the safest. Rooms were small compared to what im use to, however we were in Japan where land is scarce so its understandable. Reception were very polite and courteous and helpful in everyway they can. They speak just enough english to understand and get by. We got gifts from booking it on their website in a form of some socks for the males and some face towels for the females which was a surprise. The rooms were comfortable, had airconditioning, TV, and small bathroom, but adequate. You would compare this to a Formula 1 hotel in Sydney but better in the hotel lobby area.. For the price compared to other hotels in the location it was great value for money. Would stay there again.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR346683787", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "GabeTravel"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d621201-r19040563-Toyoko_Inn_Shinjuku_Kabuki_cho-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "621201", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
