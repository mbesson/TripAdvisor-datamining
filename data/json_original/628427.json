{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good location but poor quality rooms The place is quite hard to locate at first as its off most of the tourist maps. However once you do find it it is actually quite easy to get to and from. If you are going the best way is to go to Alexanderplatz S-Bahn Station, exit following signs Drickenstrasse and you will see a tram stop for the M2 tram straight outside. Get this and after about 15 mins get off at Am Steinberg and walk back around to the next block and you are there.The accomodation itself is very dated - looks like not much decoration or refurnishing has been done since the 1950s/60s. I was in one of the attic rooms and the room had that smell that you get when nobody has stayed there for a long time. There was no curtain on my window so I was woken up at 4am by the sun shining through! Having said that the owner was very friendly and helpful especially when my friend was delayed by a very late plane and he said it was fine to check in late. Breakfast was also good. Overall I would stay again if they had a refurbishment as the location is pretty good.", "Date": "Jun 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR147522495", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Jonny05"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d628427-r8004212-Pension_Anne_Kathrin_Bigus-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "628427", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
