On the plus side, It's in a good location, across from Fort Canning Park and a few steps from the MRT (Dhoby Ghaut Station on the Purple Line) and two shopping malls (Park Mall and Singapur Shopping Complex). It is also close to the major shopping road (Orchard Road) that sells all the designer clothing. Amenities include a large outside pool, baggage storage area, a gift shop and a complimentary mediocre breakfast. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. On the negative side, the hotel had a large lobby but nothing to sit on! There's no free internet service. They do provide internet service in a non private area in the lobby at a premium charge. The room with two small twin beds was small and smelled of smoke though designated as a non-smoking room. They offered to spray the room but never did. There was a small desk and a small fridge but no drawers to put your clothes in. The bathroom had only a bath towel; when asked about the wash cloths and hand towels, they stated that they do not provide that. There was only one electrical plug in the entire room which was controlled by the key card to your room. So if you have more than one electrical device to charge, you'll have to wait until you are in your room to charge it and can only charge one at a time. We were told that we got upgraded to an executive room. If this is what you get for an executive room, I'd hate to see what you'd get for a standard room! There's no taxi pull in to this hotel. I told the front desk that I needed a taxi to the airport early morning. They indicated that they would book a taxi for me. The taxi meter registered $14.85 to the airport but the taxi driver charged me $32 stating that the difference of $17 is the booking fee! Though I'd recommend this hotel for the location, I think it is overpriced for what you get. There are many surrounding hotels that offer better amenities for the same price.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cClean place\u201d", "Author": "vptsindia", "ReviewID": "UR127913368", "Content": "The location is slightly away from Orchard Road which is slightly inconvenient for tourists.

We had a late night flight and the hotel had a secure room for our bags to stay after we checked-out. The best thing about the hotel is its location. It borders the park and we were easily able to walk to Clarke Quay in about 10 to 15 minutes. In the other direction, Orchard Road and all that it offers (e.g., Starbucks, restaurants, shopping) is nearby and easily accessible by foot depending on how far you want to walk. We spent most of our time walking Orchard Road and even felt safe coming back late at night around midnight. Public transit is also readily available as the hotel is a short 5 minute walk from the Dhoby Ghaut station. The directions we found to the hotel from Dhoby Ghaut from other travelers were very helpful and worth repeating \u2013 take the Park Mall exit and go towards the Park Mall building on the left; enter the building and take the elevator down to the 4th floor; exit the 4th floor to the parking structure and the hotel is directly in front of you; go left to exit the parking structure and walk around to the front of the hotel (it really is a lot easier than it sounds).

Dhoby Ghaut MRT was 5 min walk away. This station connects 3 MRT lines, so actually you can get from this station almost everywhere in Singapore.

Only 3,20 SGD per way and you get 1 dollar deposit away from this price when returning the travelcard to the machine. And it takes about 50 minutes depending on the terminal you are going to or arriving. Also you can get from Woodlands with MRT. One tip for travellers arriving (from the airport) to the hotel. Take MRT to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. Take the Park Mall exit. Up you can easily see the Park Mall. Enter the building. You'll find the elevators just in front of you. Now you are on the first floor.

But This Is Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Lifetraveler1", "ReviewID": "UR123296783", "Content": "Today I am in Singapore, yeah! It is someplace that I have wanted to visit for a long time. It has been about 21 hours of planes and transfers. But now I am settled! Looked for hotel rates before leaving the states! The average hotel was running $250 to $350 plus per night. Especially if you wanted to be near Orchard Rd, the main shopping and visitor area in the city. Using tripadvisor.com, support by some other websites, this YWCA Fort Canning Lodge came up with the best rates. So I decided to try it. Even though I guaranteed my room, with my arriving at 100am in the morning, I was concerned that my room may have been given away (that's happened before). But no, they had everything ready for me, so I was able to come in a crash. Location: This hotel is located at coordinates, N1 17 50.95,E103 50 41.59, near the Orchard Road shopping area. You go through the garage next door, take the elevator down to the first level, where you pop out in a mall. Across the street from the mall is the MRT Dhoby Ghaut, which sits on Orchard Road. This access, so easily to the subway train makes it easy for you to find your way around the central district. The Building: Looks to be about 12 stories tall, with a decent amount of vegetation surrounding it. It looks like it is in good shape and there was no reason to pause about going into it. The Lobby: Is very simple and plain, but it is clean and the staff that greeted me were very nice. There are two computers in the lobby for accessing the internet, however, there is a small fee, unless you room promotion included unlimited internet as part of the package.. Mine did. The Hallways: They were also simple, nothing fancy, but yet they were very clean. The Room: This room is rather small (see my photos) and the word plain comes to mine again. There are no textured walls, no photographs or pictures hanging on the wall. The flooring looks like a nice quality wood grain laminate. However, the lighting system is a little crazy. Once you come into the room, you have to stick your key card in a slot near your door. Only with the key card in this slot will the various lights come on and work. Once the key card is removed, the room goes dark if it is night. So you must remember to stick it in the slot as you are walking in the door. There is a safe in your closet for the room and that's good. The closet space is ample for two folks staying several days. There is only one decent size drawer to stick your dirty clothes in. There is a small fridge and a regular tube tv set, which appears to be about 19 inches. There is a desk with an 'ethernet' cable for your computer. Wireless is only provided downstairs in the lobby and dining area. The Bed: There are two in the room. The bed would be considered a little bit firm. but when you are tired, you really won't notice it. One of them has this very faint stain on the bedspread, but I'm not sleeping in that one. The Bathroom, It is also small. Two good steps in and you are already at the walk-in shower. However the facilities within the bathroom looked okay. The glass enclosed shower let's water bypass the glass door and it usually ends up on the floor in the bathroom, but nothing serious. Other Items: Internet is not free until it is part of your hotel package. Breakfast is included and it was pretty good. Besides typical Asian fare, they had items that most Americans would consider typical breakfast at home. Ants, yes let's talk ants. Between last night and tonight I have smashed up 6 of these very small, but very fast little ants. They ants appear on hard surfaces like the business desk, but not on the beds. I thought it was a hotel issue until I found them again at other places in city today. I saw them in restrooms in public buildings. My consensus is that $100 per nights is not a value. However, with other hotels costing three time more then yes, this is a value relatively speaking. I'd stay here again. Although I may look for a Hostel for the remainder of my stay. You can cut your cost in half.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cDelight all the way\u201d", "Author": "SurajitMitra", "ReviewID": "UR123241762", "Content": "I was initially sceptical on this hotel after reading few negative comments about it.

The room was just like any 3 star room should be.. with comfortable beds, wardrobe, fridge, TV, clean bathroom etc. The coffee/tea supplies were replenished everyday.

The breakfast was extensive though almost the same every day.. but we loved it as it filled us up for the day.. lots of fruits, juices etc..

However as of late there has been a lot of other hostels/cheap hotels that are offering a more competitive price for about the same standards within reasonable locations. Personally my opinion of the place has also changed over the years due to this. Although Fort Canning Lodge would still fall under the 'budget hotel' category, based on the room prices you would be expecting a slightly better situation than what they have to offer. My last visit here was perhaps the worst of the many times I've stayed. The first room we were assigned to had a musty smell like mould + cigarettes, bathroom sink had a lot of limescale stains (possibly from age) and a few unsightly hairs over the floor. After inquiring about room availability we were assigned to a different room at a better location with slight improvement. Not one to be too picky when staying 'on a budget', I would just say that the cleaners were perhaps just not too thorough when cleaning the bathrooms. Other than that, the room as a whole was satisfactory, although perhaps a little overpriced compared to other budget places and quite small. Staff are not too friendly, but not particularly rude or anything like that. Parking can be quite a hassle as they only allow a one-time FOC entry/exit, which is a problem for those who need to go in and out frequently.

We got in, and the lobby was huge but plain. No problems at all with our reservations, and there were 3 elevators which made sure there wasn't a long wait. When we got to the room though, first thought, \"Dormitory!\" We asked for a double and single bed for me, my wife and twelve year old daughter. We got 3 single beds instead. The room hardly had extra space. The floor was parquet and bare. There was a single window facing the pool side, a table with a water kettle, a small TV, and a small bathroom. But the closet was huge! And there was an empty refrigerator! None of those little cans and bottles that cost a fortune eating up precious space! But, since all we planned to do in the room was keep our stuff safe and sleep in, we agreed. For the price, it was great. The hot water was hot and the air-conditioning was cold. We went outside for our first look around the place, and discovered how wonderful the surrounding area was. We were right in front of Fort Canning Park, and beside us was the parking lot of the Park Mall where we went through to get to Dhoby Gaut Station, which was an intersection of all the train routes!!! So we could get anywhere from there! Breakfast the next day was very filling, and though it wasn't varied too much, it was very satisfying. There were cereals, rice, pasta, dimsum, eggs, salads and fruits, with either sausages or bacon. The coffee was brewed very well and the milk was fresh. For a 3-star, it was worth it.

Unfortunely the airline site or the hotels internet connection was slow and we didn\u2019t finish our changes. The staff gave us an extra time for free. This is when we found that it was the airline site that was having trouble. We decided to try again in an hour timer We came back to try again (this was at 10pm) and when we went to pay for another connection they could see our grief and gave it to us free again.

Today I emailed the hotel to confirm that we would be 3 people, only to be told that the 3rd person would have to pay $70 ++ extra per night as there were only 2 single beds in the room ..... unless of course 2 people were to sleep together in a single bed !! Further more, when questioned about the photos on their website, I was told that the photos appeared to show a large bed due to fact that \"the picture angle was from the side of the room\" Needless to say that they do not want to refund me my 10% deposit. I am only thankful that I discovered the true nature of this hotel straight away, 10% deposit is a small price to pay for what would have surely been a very uncomfortable holiday.

The AC is individually controlled for each the living room and the bedroom but at night we turned off the AC and opened the window, and still could sleep comfortably.

The only negative was the location, which is not bad for adults but could be challenging for small children to travel on foot.

Perfect location, a few minutes walk from a central MRT station (Dhobi Gaut). Everything of interest radiates out from here. The walk through the covered car park and the lift (four floors) saves the long flight of steps up the steep hill at the side of Park Mall. 2. Perfectly adequate breakfast. We enjoyed the rice and noodles - which, contrary to another review, were different every morning of our 8 night stay, as was the rest of the choice. Plenty of fresh fruit. Coffee poor, but Singapore is not a coffee culture - we didn't get a good cup of coffee anywhere - so it's wise to stick to tea. 3. Evening meals were adequate when we were tired off the long flight. However, it was disconcerting to eat alone, and the choice was limited (though tasty). The doorman recommended Plaza Singapura beyond the MRT station- the excellent food hall on Level 6 had good value meals with a wide variety of fantastic food freshly prepared. 4. There's no hotel bar (if that's important to you). We brought duty free spirits with us and bought the mixers locally to keep in the fridge, so it didn't matter to us. Alcohol is very expensive compared to UK - about twice what we'd expect to pay at home. 5. I don't think there's WiFi in the rooms, but we didn't bring a laptop anyway. There's internet access in the lobby, you get a password from the reception desk. 6. Spacious room, freshly decorated (we opted for mid-price Executive with a double bed, rather than cheaper Standard or more expensive Deluxe room). Kept spotlessly clean, but not boutique style - more upmarket college hall of residence. Fridge big enough to chill your bottles of water or tins of mixers. The room was twice as large as one we visited in Ibis Bencoolen (which was claustrophobically small). Our TV and its remote worked fine and the CNN channel gave us all the news we wanted. There's a safe in the huge wardrobe. (One hotel we almost booked was too small for a wardrobe.) 7. Pleasant views of leafy Fort Canning Park on the other side of the road. However, rooms on the other side would look onto Park Mall and may be less appealing. 8. The swimming pool is big enough to do proper lengths, to ease off muscles aching from much walking or sitting on a plane for 12 hours. There were children's swimming lessons every afternoon but there was a generous section left for other swimmers. Basic changing room, but adequate. No jacuzzi to sit in, no poolside bar, no problem. 9. I can't understand the honeymoon couple's review complaining about the house keeping staff coming in unexpectedly - we used the 'do not disturb' sign and the door lock to prevent this, as it can happen at any hotel in the world. The staff always knocked and called several times on the other doors nearby. Housekeeping checks the minibar daily. You can have clean sheets every day if you want; we were given fresh towels daily. 10. It's an interesting place - it's not just a hotel. Courses are run here, there are offices for the YWCA business side. There was always an interesting range of people - all ages, multi-racial, families, business people. It did feel especially safe for women travelling solo. The quiet leafy courtyard is a bonus in a city centre location. Although it's a Christian Association, the Christian message was not intrusive or heavy in any way. 11. I strongly recommend booking through Expedia - you pay up front, so you're not affected by the varying exchange rates, and they give you a lot of support and confidence in a long-established web site. Many other websites don't include the various local taxes in their rates, so you can get an unpleasant surprise (an additional 10% or more) on checking out. 12. My sister and brother-in-law were staying at the Ibis, but said that next time they visit they'll come to Fort Canning Lodge. If the things it doesn't have aren't an issue for you (no bar, flat screen TV, WiFi, spa bubble pool, boutique cushions on the bed, room service), then its price and location make it ideal.

We had to shell out $130 and paid it to a VERY arrogant front desk person. And oh yes, the room...it looked like one of those rooms which have not been used for ages. The room and bed smelled..and I was itching the whole night. And the bathroom was dirty. There was a tiny old TV (old meaning, it doesn't come with a remote and you literally switch channels..although there weren't any working channels). At 3am, I was already looking through the yellow pages trying to find another place to stay for that night. I didn't care anymore about the $130 we paid. Picture those run-down motel rooms you see in the movies, and you'd get the idea. The next day, they transferred us to another room, larger and much cleaner..but still basic. With the same kind of TV, and still with no working channels. And as we were getting changed to leave, the cleaner just suddenly went inside our room without knocking..which was kinda embarrassing. Breakfast was so-so..it was the same everyday, and the orange juice was powdered and was not even cold. Location is great, though. It is right in front of the museum and close to a nice park.

I work as a Supervisor in a BPO company, & my colleagues persuaded me to visit this beautiful country in order to unwind. We stayed in YWCA Fort Canning Lodge for 5 days (May 31 \u2013 June 4, 2009), and I solely based my decision to the reviews that I saw on this website. Please don't expect too much from this hotel. The reason why I chose this hotel was that it\u2019s the cheapest hotel near Orchard road. The pictures of the hotel that I saw BEFORE our arrival were kind of deceiving. I saw a lot of 3-star hotels even in other countries, and they\u2019re much better than YWCA Fort Canning Lodge. The receptionists are not really friendly and presentable (fusion of Indians and Chinese). Just waiting for our keys (or cards) already took several minutes. The elevators are\u201d low-tech\u201d because you need to insert a guest card in order to use it (most of the time the card has a defect!). I reserved one twin-sharing bedroom online (their website) and when we saw the room (#1116), we were really shocked because it has 1 queen-size bed only (doesn\u2019t look queen-size at all). I called the reception because it really looks like a single bed, and they said that they already upgraded it to an executive room for free (the room is really small and no bath tub). Well, in as much as I wanted to be thankful, it\u2019s difficult because we didn\u2019t expect these \u201cpeculiar\u201d service/features of the hotel. By the way, they use a different kind of plug (different than what we are using here in the Philippines) and when we tried to borrow a plug/outlet for our devices, the receptionist was really rude so I just hung up on him because I can\u2019t stand the bad customer service that they\u2019re giving to their customers. He apologized eventually but the damage has been done. To sum it up, it\u2019s bad customer service and below average facilities. The location, however, is GREAT since it\u2019s near the MRT station. This is the only advantage that I saw when we stayed in the hotel. It\u2019s very accessible! The said station is only \u201c2-stations-away\u201d from Orchard Road, which is really ideal for shopping & even \u201cwindow-shopping\u201d. By the way, they have this GREAT SINGAPORE SALE this month so visit the country for great bargains! Also, the hotel is beside the Park Mall and near Plaza Singapoora (this is a great mall especially if you wanna buy cheap stuffs (better go to Daizo shop, level 5 - I think!). By the way, it\u2019s really hard to get a taxi in Fort Canning so it\u2019s better to just go to the MRT (It\u2019s a cool experience!), only 2 SGD with a refund of $1 when you return the ticket in the machine afterwards. During our last day, I asked the hotel to call a taxi for our transfer us to the airport, and it cost a fixed rate of 35 SGD (around 1,155 Philippine peso) and the airport is really not that far from the hotel. The free breakfast buffet is not good. During our stay in the hotel, they offered the same menu most of the time (chicken franks, nuggets, noodles,etc). Also, during our last day, I was startled because the charges or the bill that I needed to pay became higher. Just a piece of advice (especially to those people who \u201cbook\u201d online), don\u2019t trust the figures or prices that you see yet since it doesn\u2019t include the taxes, charges etc. The internet is 5 SGD for 30 minutes, no wifi or internet access in their rooms (you have to pay if you want). The souvenir shop on the ground floor offers cheap souvenirs. The swimming pool is tolerable and child-friendly since its 5 feet only. I would not say that you should not stay in this hotel. The location is great and the room packages are really cheaper compared to other hotels. And this hotel is the CHEAPEST hotel near Orchard road. If you have extra money, I suggest that you find another hotel like the Grand Central or Mandarin. But if you\u2019re in a budget, still wants a good location, and the service/facilities are not an \u201cissue,\u201d then you can stay in this hotel. I posted a lot of pictures to help you decide.

As a frequent traveller in Southeast Asia, I have had my share of bad experiences but for a 3-star hotel like this one, I couldn't believe what I saw. When we first checked in, the room given to us reeked of urine and the toilet seat was broken. Disgusted at what I saw, I requested a room switch which was initially denied by the receptionist. It wasn't until I requested to talk to the manager that I got my room changed. Second room had ants in the washroom floor. Ants. The A/C was ridiculously loud and when the hotel sent up a pest control person to deal with the ants, he ended up overspraying my entire washroom with pesticide. Needless to say, my room stank for the rest of the day. The TV cable was definitely sub-par. On their website, they advertise having nice cable TV, but in reality, there were only about 4 viewable channels with the rest being either fuzzy or difficult to see. 3 Star Hotel Huh? I've had much better TV service in Cambodia costing $10US a night. The service workers in the morning have no utter regard of customer service. I got a knock on my door at 9am from them requesting to inspect my 'minibar' in my room to see whether or not I ate or drank their goods. Without giving her permission, she literally walked into the room, invading our privacy. Frustrated, I demanded some compensation for my horrible experience. Luckily, one of the managers was very accomodating and was probably, the only one qualified in customer service. The best I got was a room upgrade to the 'family suite', not even a discount on the room rate. Sadly, the family suite upgrade also had ants on the table, the TV was fuzzy and even worse, the A/C system made even more noise than ever. At this moment, I was too stressed out and tired with the whole situation to bother making another complaint again. Upon checking out, the billing system wasn't clear at all and it appeared as if I was being double-taxed for the entire stay. I sent an email to the hotel about the situation afterwards and all I received was some non-chalant reply and a message not to submit an internet review of their hotel to 'tarnish their good reputation'.

The room is clean,and has a refrigerator/ air conditioning/TV/and a good bathroom with a shower. The two things I like best are: 1.A nice,qood-sized pool outside. It's so good to enjoy the sun.The pool area is nice!! 2. An all-you-can-eat breakfast(comes with the room) that includes a tray of cut papaya. It also means you're so full you can skip cost of lunch. Also it is located conviently near transportation. You don't have to tak an expensive cab.

At the top, turn left. Go until on right are glass auto-open doore. Go thru to the elevator. Take to 1st floor. Out the door is three options: 1. To the rightis a bus stop. Take a buss there to the Botanical Garden. The orchid garden is fantastic!!! 2. Straight across the street, you take an escalator down to MRT underground train syste. It goes to bird park(bus required at the other end)/ downtown/ and orchard street. 3. To the left of MRT station is a multi- story building. This is PLAZA SINGAPURA.

But I couldn't see the difference, as it looks like a hotel to me. I stayed in this hotel with my wife and my junior in December 2005, a vacation. If you want to book this hotel, I would suggest book it via internet travel agent, as I only paid USD108 (approx SD180) for two nights stay (SD90 per night) including breakfast for two. If you walk in, the rate will be SD140 per night. My room was upgraded to deluxe room for free during my stay due to all standard rooms being occupied. The room is quite spacious. The floor is wood, no carpet. It's equipped with a queen size bed, standing shower (no bath tub), TV and mini fridge. The fridge has variety of sodas, bottles of cooled mineral water, and also two bowls of instant noodle. The price is approx double the market price, but I guess this is normal. Two packs of free instant coffee and tea each (3-in-1 type). No free drinking water though; you have to boil it yourself with a small kettle. There is a notice stating that all calls made from the room will be charged as same as calls made from public phone, it is by Singtel (one of the three telco). I don't know how true it is as I didn't make any call. At night, it could be a little noisy as what mentioned by other reviewer. The room is not sound proof, I could hear clearly other guest opening and closing their room doors, and also when they speak in the corridor. YWCA only has one restaurant, more like a coffee house actually. It serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, and it close at 9pm. You won't be able to get anything to eat after 10pm as the coffee house is closed, you would have to travel quite far to get a meal, especially after 10pm where shopping malls are closed too. This hostel also doesn't have room service. I guess this is the reason it's not called a hotel. The breakfast is only average. Not many choices, with a fried noodle, fried rice, sausage, toast, fried and boiled egg, salads and that's about it. Juice, tea and coffee are included, of course. During my stay, they have buffet dinner at SD8.80+, it's Chinese dishes, not much choice also, but value for money. Staying in YWCA is very convenient if you travel by MRT, as Dhoby Ghaut MRT station is just across the street. There're few ways to go to the MRT station, I would suggest entering the Park Mall car park, and take a lift to ground floor. Exit Park Mall through the lobby, cross the street and reach the MRT station. If you prefer taxi, it will be quite difficult to wait for a taxi at YWCA, as most taxis will be occupied, unless you pay extra SD2~SD4 to book for a taxi, or wait for someone to arrive at YWCA and take his/her taxi. Orchard Road is just 2 stations (MRT) from Dhoby Ghaut, so does Bugis Junction. Walking and taking MRT to most places of interest is no problem from YWCA. Except Singapore Zoo, which is located quite far from the nearest MRT station, I paid SD4 for a taxi from Zoo to Khatib MRT station. YWCA also has a swimming pool, quite big, not Olympic size though, this is a hostel, remember? Overall, this is a great hotel, or hostel for less than SD100 per night (via internet agent booking). If you are on a budget, just like me, look no further. If money is not an issue, go stay in Orchard road, so that the view could be better, and also a better breakfast.", "Date": "December 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Queensland, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, shame about the noisy groups staying\u201d", "Author": "Denise07012", "ReviewID": "UR4148674", "Content": "Bright and airy reception area.
