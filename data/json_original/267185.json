We managed to tough it out for one night only because I was too tired to find another hotel at midnight. The room smelled awful when we walked in and had the tiniest tv I have ever seen in a hotel. The bathroom was absolutely filthy and scary. There was mold and scum everywhere. We had three towels total in the room and no bathmat. The continental breakfast is a complete joke and ours was cut short by three Kissimmee police cars pulling up to deal with another guest who was much more vocal in his displeasure with the hotel. We checked out immediately and moved down the road. My suggestion is to not even bother checking in. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again if they paid me to.", "Date": "June 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNot good!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3274952", "Content": "Not a good deal at all, we got what we thought was a great deal but quickly realized, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! It is not clean at all. It is very loud, we were woke up at least once each night by people screaming or car alarms going off and the hotel staff did nothing about it. Also it is not convienient to Disney at all. OH, Also, I reserved a crib before we came. When we got there they said they had none. After arguing with then for 5 minutes a manager came over and said, ok I have a brand new one in the storage room you can use if you agree to pay 5 dollars a night for it. I did because I had no other choice. They brought the crib up and no one could figure out how ito put it together.

Only stay here if you are on a really strict budget, and get a rate of <$20. The carpets are dirty, along with the rest of the room.

This hotel is not sanitary, and is not where you want to stay, beacuse it will ruin your trip, it did mine to Disney World. The connentinental breakfast is also trash, just cereal + bagels. Not a good place for a family, i had to learn that the hard way. The only good thing was my bed was made every day (unecpected). This is not the place you want to stay with your family, i found that out the hard way. Bottom line, it is not the 2.5 star hotel it is reated, at best it is a 1 star.

The soap that was in there was from Ramada inn???????? The pool's only security was a chain link lock that they chained at 10pm, other than that, with a little one, we were right by the pool, with no self locking latch.

We had three rooms for seven nights - big mistake! They would not clean our rooms every day. The carpet in \"our\" room was so dirty that is made our white socks black - just like if we would have walked around outside without shoes on. My \"mothers\" room the bed was broke and the head of the bed slumped onto the floor. The second room that they gave my mother had a broken microwave. Our room had a broken shower head. All the showers in the place had mold growing around them. They would not leave clean towels or toilet paper in your room. You would have to go to the desk and get some yourself and then they would only give you a half of roll of toilet paper and two towels. No wash clothes or bath mats. The one day when I went to get soap and toilet paper they lady gave me paper towels and told me that they were out of toilet paper. The breakfast consisted of white bread and english muffins with butter and coffee. The juice and milk thing had been out of order for awhile. ALL the ice mechines in the hotel were out of order. The TV's in the rooms are really small. The ladies at the front desk kept blaming everything on the fact that the manager was in Canada and the owner was in Iraq so no one was around to order supplies or anything. Also, this is not a maingate hotel! It is quite a way from Disney. I would not recemend this hotel to anyone.
