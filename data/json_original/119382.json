Weekend rates were slightly higher than weekday rates, as was expected, but the overall price was good. When we checked in we were told that we'd already paid (though the charge hadn't shown up on our credit card statement). Upon checkout, we asked for a receipt and were refused. Specifically we were told that since they'd already charged us (they hadn't), we didn't need to sign off on the charges, so a receipt wouldn't be provided. Uh okay... Then the charge shows up on our card, much higher than the rate we agreed to when making our reservation. After speaking with the manager on the phone, we were told that because the reservation was made with a third party (not an Inn staff member over the phone), the rates could change without notice and a refund would not be issued. We again asked for an itemized receipt and was given the run around. When the manager finally agreed to provide a receipt, he made it difficult. We had to receive a faxed form, fill it out, and fax it back just to have him snail mail a receipt (or so he said...we've yet to receive it). The other issue was that the Inn was under construction. To be fair, we knew this was happening as it was mentioned in our reservation confirmation. However, it was stated on that confirmation (and posted all over the Inn) that the construction would be confined to 9am-5pm Monday through Friday. This was not the case at all! Construction noise could be heard at all hours on all days that we were staying there (Thursday-Sunday). Additionally, the water was turned off not only during the posted construction times, but on Saturday as well. When we mentioned this to the manager while discussing the room rate increase, he stated that he knew for a fact the water was not off on Saturday during our stay. After arguing, he finally said he'd take $30 off the bill after discussing the water situation with his construction crew. All in all, we weren't in the room much during our trip. When we were, it was a constant source of irritation. We won't stay here again because of the poor customer service.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livingston, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good choice\u201d", "Author": "solo m", "ReviewID": "UR126174730", "Content": "I just spent two nights here, during renovations.

We really enjoyed our time here. It is at the southern end of venice beach, and only a block away from the water (a LOT of hotels in the area are several km away from the beach). It is on the same street as venice fishing pier. Just north of the marina, and at the southern end of the canals. The action end of Venice Boulevard is at the northern end- close enough to walk to, but able to escape from by coming back to the nicer southern end. (Venice boulevard is not a place where you want to be staying right in the middle of all the action). There are plenty of places to eat dinner nearby, from Japanese to Italian to Mexican to bars. Prices were pretty good at all of these places. No laundry on site, and no coin laundry nearby, but there is a cleaners a couple of blocks up the road. Parking on site is plentiful, but costs $7 per day (from memory). Breakfast is great with a lot of variety, held in the pretty courtyard on the first floor. Cleaning is good and rooms are very spacious (we had a rollaway bed for the third person and still had a heap of space to move around the room. Rollaway bed was surprisingly sturdy and good quality). Sometimes street noise can carry through the windows if you are on the Washington Blvd side. Wifi is fast and always worked well while we were there. Staff were always very friendly on the front desk. There is a small fitness centre on site which you can use, or you can walk/run along Venice boulevard (better in the mornings before it gets crowded). I would definitely stay here again when we return to LA at the end of our trip. We booked last minute so prices were a little better, but overall the rates are reasonable, especially for LA. In terms of location this is a great area as parking is plentiful and you can walk around easily at night, and a much nicer atmosphere than Hollywood or Beverley Hills. I prefer Santa Monica but as the hotels there are not in my budget, Venice was an excellent alternative; this hotel has the best location in Venice in proximity to the beach, canals, marina and plenty of eating and drinking options.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thunder Bay, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPricey but good location and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "ThunderBayHiker", "ReviewID": "UR122951336", "Content": "This is an average hotel in a great location so I guess they can justify the prices.

But, as we found out to our great discomfort, the Inn at Venice Beach definitely does not come up to the same standard of quality as the others, even thoug it was the most expensive of all three Pacifica Hotels that we stayed at during this trip. Up front, the only positive comment I have is that the room was clean and the bed comfortable, although the television set was a vintage crt model (all other hotels we stayed at had large flat screen HD television sets). We had reserved a room with King bed, but when we arrived were informed that the only one available was at the front of the hotel, above the lobby, which fronts onto a very busy thoroughfare. The room had absolutely no sound-proofing - single glazed metal frame windows that do nothing to stop the noise of all-night busy traffic. We could plainly hear the conversations of people on the sidewalk below (there are parking spaces along the curb outside the lobby), and at a nearby bus stop. Late into the night, and early next morning, buses frequently pulled up to the stop and then accelerated noisily away. To make the situation worse, there was a gap around the in-wall room heater/air conditioner that was so large that we could see daylight through it. So the street noise just traveled straight through the gap as well. We spent a very disturbed night with little sleep. Next morning, a Saturday, continental breakfast was supposed to be available until 10:30 am, but the coffee and juices were all gone by 10 am, and althought there was nothing to drink, no one came by to refill them. We complained later to the receptionist, but he countered by saying there was a phone in the breakfast room that we could have used to call for assistance. I saw no phone, so if you read this Inn at Venice Beach, how about putting a sign in the room to inform guests on how to get assistance?

The best value for money was Bally's in Las Vegas. The most luxorious was The Village Lodge Mammoth Lakes and not too expensive closely followed by a B&B in Morro Bay.. The worst place was I'm afraid Caverns Inn ( really poor) near the Grand Canyon followed closely by the Venice Beach House also for poor accomodation compared with value for money, the Venice Beach House even charged $20 for parking. I still can't get over the $368 charged for one night poor B&B (\u00c2\u00a3250). Another problem which I think will affect the tourist industry is the cost of eating out.

Location is great if you want to hit the beaches or walk the front. There are a number of restaurants in a short walk, and the ones we tried had good food and reasonable prices.

My room overlooked a busy outdoor restaurant and it was noisy until 1 or 2 in the morning. I asked to change rooms and the only other rooms were along the busy street into town. The walls are paper thin and I could hear everything the guests were doing in the room next door. Breakfast was typical continental fare. The room smelt really bad and the furnishings were old or outdated. I thought for 155 per night I would have better accomadations. I paid for only for the luxury of staying near the beach. After one day it was enough. I wish I had spent the money elsewhere and just drove in and paid for the parking.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "Shakes96", "ReviewID": "UR104043245", "Content": "We stayed here recently and had a great stay.

The rest: One is greeted upon entry with a sign warning that the building contains toxic materials that can be dangerous to one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health. When I asked for the brochure describing these toxic materials, the clerk could not locate a copy. He mumbled something about proposition 65, but never produced an explanation of the toxins. The building is old, funky and in serious need of renovation. The bathroom was so small that one had to navigate to get in and out. The bathtub / shower combination was old with lots of black mold growing between the tiles. The blankets on the beds were stained and torn. A true flop house. Our room was on a corner was so noisy that we could not sleep. There was noise from traffic, from people walking on the sidewalks, and from the interior halls of the hotel. A true insult. The ventilating fan in the bathroom would have put a Mack truck to shame. The room was dark and poorly lighted. Only one of the two floor lamps worked. The small refrigerator tucked into an alcove added to the noise pollution. But, worst of all was the old through-the-wall air conditioner. Its noise level rivaled a jet aircraft taking off. We turned it off rather than suffer the noise. When we asked about why there were no double pane windows, we again were given a mumbled answer that the walls were too thin to allow the installation of noise resisting windows. Total nonsense. Then there was the shower. When the hot water finally arrived, it was regularly laced with freezing cold water. No adjustment was possible.

There was a wonderful courtyard, but we never sat in it because of the weather being a bit chilly. Next time. Would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. And, I'm picky.

We rented the loft room and they took the bed in the upper section while I slept on the futon on the main level. We had a third floor apartment facing Washington Blvd. The loft room had a small kitchenette where there was a mini fridge, a sink, and a coffee maker. The hotel seemed like it was in fine shape. First and foremost, the hotel had a great location. The walk to the Venice pier, the beach, and the boardwalk was only 2 or 3 minutes. Santa Monica was only a few miles to the North as well. The carpets in the hotel may be a little old but the rooms, blankets, and towels all smelled clean. Everything was nicely cleaned in the kitchenette and bathroom as well. There was a large CRT TV on both levels of the loft. The futon was comfortable enough, I had no problems sleeping on it. Light sleepers should beware of the noise coming from the street. There is a bar/club located just down the street where there were live bands and loud people until around midnight on weekends and one of the weeknights that we were there. We didn't mind much, and found the noise to be more than tolerable when you simply left the patio door shut. We opted to leave ours open most nights, but I am a very heavy sleeper. I awoke to the sound of a jackhammer that had apparently been drilling across the street for the last 2 hours, so noise was no issue for me. The service was very good. We would head down for breakfast and by the time we got back up to our room it would already be finished. They would neatly remake the beds and replace all of the towels, and also replaced the creams and such that were complimentary and a big help. The continental breakfast was delicious. They had a reasonable assortment of coffee, juices, bagels, pastries, and fruits to choose from. The dining room was clean, but we chose to eat in the courtyard every morning. It was a very nice setting with a fountain and was open to the elements (no roof) which was a nice way to start each morning. The receptionists were all very nice to us. They would always smile and greet us everytime we came back into the hotel and seemed like genuinely kind people.

I decided to combat the traffic issue by activating my navigation on my Blackberry (Highly recommended and worth the extra bucks). After reseaching a variety of hotels, motels, B & Bs, I settled on the Inns at Venice Beach. My teenage son and I rolled into Venice late on Saturday night and tenitively strolled into the small lobby adjacent to the garage. We received a warm welcome, quick service and directions to a late meal from a pleasent young man at the front desk. As we rode the elevator and walked the mezzanine around the open court yard to our room my son and I to agreed that so far so good, the Inn seemed pleasent enough. While the Inn at Venice is not a four star, four diamond property it is a clean and straight to the point \"funky boutique hotel\" in a great and safe neighborhood. The beach is a block away, restaurants are plenty and acess to all major highways are less then 10 minutes away (very easy with the help of a good map and or navigator, again highly recommended for us out of towners). The Inn offeres a free, fresh and plentiful continental breakfast and pleasent customer service. My only disappointment was the noise, as mentioned earlier we arrived to the hotel late and the hope of sleeping in was diminished with the noise of early raisers and housekeeping as the rooms don't seem well insulated and sound traveled straight through the walls and through the pillow that covered my head forcing me to start my day at the crack of dawn. Because the hotel is in such a great neighborhood my son and I did not hesitate to grab our sneakers and go for a morning run through the eclectic streets of Venice turning my crumpy, early rise into a very pleasent day... Yes I would recommend the Inn at Venice to everyone I know. Infact as this trip was a college tour trip and my son's top choice of school is right in the heart of LA I predict that I'll be visiting the Inn at Venice again, with ear plugs and sneakers in tow.

Parking is quite convenient as the hotel has it's own self parking facility which costs USD 7 a night which is a good price for that area. The room is quite big and so is the bathroom area. The room is not very modern (i.e. no flat screen TV etc.) but everything is clean and the bed is very comfortable. I had some minor issues with the drainage in the shower and my phone was not working very well. However those are details. Also the WiFi was bit patchy as it kept logging me out. I tried with my iPhone and my laptop and both seemed to have problems. Not sure what the problem was. Breakfast was the typical continental breakfast type with cereals, bagels, hard boiled eggs etc. It was not bad and was served in a small room on the first floor. Check-out was efficient and quick which was appreciated. To sum it up, it's a good hotel and if you can get it for the right price (USD 117 p/night excl tax and parking) it is really good value for money. It is also near LAX and bordering to Santa Monica.

Wow, groups of girls in bikinis on a weekday in March now and then! Great stuff. If you head the other way on Washington Boulevard, then a block away is a selection of cafes and corner stores. As you near the beach on Washington Boulevard there's a small sports store and I bought some Nike sneakers (runners) for US$90 - half the price they are available for in Australia. Last thing - in California there is SALES TAX. And they don't tell you about it, even when they quote prices to you! It's whacked on top. One minute you think you're paying US$2.50 for a hot dog and the next you think they said the total cost wrong (it's sales tax). There's no sales tax refund program when leaving LAX.

I was out during the day and was only there for one weekend. I found the rooms (had to be moved once, with notice, when minor renovation needed doing) clean and enjoyed having a small balcony to step out on. The cleaning staff seemed to take their duties seriously and the staff was very helpful. My third floor room had a high, slanting ceiling that gave it a very open, airy impression. The breakfast provided was pretty simple offerings: bagels, toast, cereals, waffles, yogurt, fruit, coffee, tea. Low protein, but an adaquate start to the day and free as well; those with certain dietary requirements may wish to take note. I found it easy to walk to the beach, boardwalk, a good variety of local restaurants and convenience stores and other neat places in Venice itself. There are a couple downsides: 1) noise. You can tell when other guests are using the shower, as the acoustic separation of rooms is not good. The front of the building faces a major thoroughfare, with traffic starting early and ending late and there is a popular restaurant right across the side street. 2) while I did not expect the place to be decked out like the Beverly Hilton, there were a number of minor \"fit and finish\" issues: loose bathroom doorknob, label adhesive left on sliding glass door, cracked tiles in bathroom, stuff like that.

I had looked for something in the area at my price range and kept finding fleabags so I was really pleased to find the Inn. We had just endured a 12 hour transatlantic flight so we were all a little tired and fed-up. What better way to revive ourselves than with the freshly-baked complimentary cookies on the reception desk?!? On subsequent days there was also a fruit basket and freshly squeezed juice, all compliments of the hotel. The location is another HUGE bonus. It was a quick and easy drive from LAX airport, and we were only 2-3 blocks from the beach. So every morning we could take a walk on the beach before breakfast, and stroll on the beach at sunset. The markets (and the endessley fascinating passing parade) of Venice Beach is about a 5 minute walk and both Santa Monica and Marina del Rey are 5 minutes by car. The rooms are enormous by European standards (although I gather pretty average by American standards!) and nicely furnished. We had a queen-sized bed and a rollaway bed in our room and it never felt too crowded. Our room faced the street, so there was some traffic noise in the morning, but nothing too bad. The room was very well equipped - there were more free toiletries than we had at any other hotel over our 17 day trip and they also provided bathrobes, which is an obsession of mine ;-) If silence is a priority, make sure to ask for a room facing onto the delicious little courtyard in the middle of the building. It's a really lovely little public area that doubles up as an overflow for the breakfast room and looks great with the lush plants and little fountain. The breakfast (served in the room adjacent to the courtyard) was good - dry cereals, instant oats, yoghurt, fruit, a selection of hot drinks, bread, bagels, waffles, Philly cream cheese, syrup, jam/jelly etc etc. And nobody seems to mind if you come downstairs, grab some food and eat in your room. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, and credit has to go to the young lady who on our first night recommended Tony P's (in Marina del Rey) for dinner on our first night. We could not believe the view when we walked in - you are RIGHT on the marina! We ate in the enclosed balcony area and had really delicious food (mmmm, clam chowder!) - and it was really reasonable for what you were getting (and downright cheap if paying in Pounds!) The only negatives were the fact that we could not for love or money get our (non wi-fi) laptop computer to work, despite lots of advice from the staff) and the fact that when you are in the bathroom, you can hear every movement in the adjacent bathroom (the staff did warn us about this and suggested we sleep with the bathroom door closed...). But apart from those two very minor gripes, I absolutely loved the Inn and I would definitely stay there again. Oh, and as somebody else has mentioned, the $4 per night parking is really reasonable!", "Date": "October 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, Great Value, Top-Notch Service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4054277", "Content": "We sere pleasantly suprprised not only with our room at the Inn but at the hospitality of the staff as well.

The room and bathroom were clean. The bathtub did have a slow drain but nothing serious. The hotel was also eco-friendly and offered many options for conservation.

The room was fantastic and had an upstairs (the bedrtoom) and a sizeable living area downstairs. The standard rooms werre big enough, but the suite was enormous! The stay was fantatsic again, as we knew it would be. There were renovations being carried out at the hotel but the noise was during the day and was minimal. We would not have noticed the rennovations had we not seen the sign in the reception lobby. The hotel is also ideally located as it's about 2 blocks away from the beach and it is such a nice wals to Venice along the boardwalk. The amenities nearby aee great.

I'll get straight to the pet peeve....I hate when I can loudly hear the shower running in the next room, and I was awoke two of the three days by the neighboring tenant. I want a quiet room where I can sleep great. Other than the shower noise it was fairly quiet. But that did bother me. Now to the positives...The staff was very, very friendly. Very nice. The location is great if you want to spend a lot of time on the beach or stroll the boardwalk. And rental bikes and skates are a block away. It is also not too far from the airport on side streets. The free continental breakfast is nice and welcomed and the room was a decent size, though I wish they had king beds in all the rooms. We had to get a queen, which is a little small for my wife and I, and we probably won't do that again. I also wish it was a little closer to the freeway, so if you plan on driving all over L.A. there might be a better location. But if the beach is a primary objective, then this is as good as it gets. I also like that the parking was only $4/day. So many hotels charge almost as much as the room it seems. And it was okay that there wasn't a bellman. The bag trolley is right there to use and you don't have to go far. The hotel is small, which is nice.
