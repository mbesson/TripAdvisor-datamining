I was somewhat anxious as some of the reviews for Central Park were pretty damning, while some were pretty glowing. I got a good \u201cgrand opening\u201d rate so I decided to chance it. From my experience, both the damning and the glowing reviews were accurate. The professional photos provided by hotel management are accurate portrayal of the ambiance of the hotel, except for the wear and tear from a few years of operation. Room: I was given room 1101, a \u201ccityview\u201d room (i.e. a room with view to concrete buildings across the street). Like most hotels in Hong Kong (except the 4* 5* ones) the room was expectedly small, but the space-use was pretty efficient. The lighting was pretty good, and the design quite pleasant and trendy. My room was not mouldy as many others have noted. The carpet was a little stained, but not overly noticeable. The furniture were pretty worn-out and cheap quality though. The air-conditioning in the room was finicky and inconsistent (compare to the consistently cool hallway). The wifi worked super fast, which was a plus. The bathroom was clean and modern overall, thought there was a little bit of moulding as reported by others. Service: While the attitude of the front desk staff was impeccable on the surface, my stay presented a substantive issue which tested true customer service, and on that front they failed. My flight was Newark was cancelled so I arrived 18 hours late. I emailed them while in Newark, still well before noon in HK time, and tell them I need to change my booking as I would not make it for the first night. They charged me for the first night nonetheless even though I did not use the room. This is the kind of situation where any sensible manager who cares about repeated business would use their discretion to waive, or at least discount, the fee for the unused night. The housekeeping staff were accommodating and helpful. No complaint there. Location: The hotel is located at the edge of the busy Soho area. Thus it is fairly central and easily walk-able from fancy restaurants, trendy bars, hip nightclubs and shopping. You can however also experience some of the most traditional/typical residential neighbourhood by simply walking around Western. It is a fairly safe neighbourhood, with no concerns about walking around even late at night. The only downside is that the closest subway or street car stops is still a small hike (approx 7 minutes) away. So overall, it was an okay stay. Nothing extraordinary, but acceptable. The hotel has some potential, if the owner is willing to invest some money and refurbish the room and turn it into a nice boutique hotel. Until then, it would only be a worthwhile stay if you can get a discount.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cCheap, good location, does most things just about well enough\u201d", "Author": "John_from_NM", "ReviewID": "UR136347731", "Content": "This is a cheap hotel in a good location in an expensive city.

We found this place on Wotif.com and booked an 'executive' room. Whilst I wouldn't put any kind of executive in it, it was perfect for our needs and represented value. The rooms are small and the bathroom is a frosted glass capsule inside it (not for the bashful). They were clean and comfortable. The air con was excellent and essential. It will only operate when you are in the room. When you go into your room at first, it can be like an oven. The broadband was quick and reliable. Beds were super comfy. The service at the hotel was excellent. They seemed to predict all your needs in advance. Bags were stored and taxis called before we even asked. The view was great, over a rare park. You stepped out on to Hollywood Rd, a fascinating area we felt extremely safe in. There are western restaurants close (Macca's and Pacific Coffee company) when the local food just won't do it anymore. And tonnes of local places. Our favourite being Lin Heung Teahouse, 160-164 Wellington St. There was also a place up Hollywood Rd called Hollywood Tea selling tea pots and tea, which made a wonderful souvenir. You could spend days exploring this area and going further in the evenings when it is cooler. Don't miss a trip to the smokey temple down the road. To get to the hotel take the airport express train to central ($160HKD for the two of us). Then ask a taxi to take you to Hollywood. You may have to ask 6 or more. They generally did not want to go on the shortish journey (still much to far to walk with suitcases).

The TV has two English channels, but the room also has an Ipod docking station and a DVD should you be caught up in the room during a rainstorm. There is free wifi which is a great speed and for those without a computer/smart phone they have Macs in the foyer. The hotel offers various services including wireless printing, a shuttle bus for the airport and laundry. The location is perfect. Surrounded by restaurants, next to a park, 5 minutes walk from SoHo and the metro system. There is a Wellcome supermarket right on the corner if you want to buy snacks to fill up your fridge.

The front desk staff was very pleasant and prepared, even with my late arrival. After reading reviews on Tripadvisor.com I asked if I could please be given a room on a higher floor. I was stunned to hear that I had been given a room on the 1st floor; however I was told \u201cWe\u2019ve actually upgraded you to one of our premium rooms\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t remember every word she said but I got the impression that this was a recently remodelled upgraded room, which is what I believe I heard. Having previously read that they were remodelling, I thought that the first floor would be as good as any place to start. They did assure me the room would be quiet. I proceeded to carry my bag up the short stairs to the lifts and on up the 1st floor (UG, then 1) I was immediately leery of this supposed remodel. The hallways are very narrow, dark, the carpet and walls also appear dirty. I approached my room to see a patched up door, not very indicative of a remodel as usually the whole floor is remodelled and not just the interior of the rooms. Upon entering my room I was greeted with a very dark, empty room with a kitchenette, a large flat panel TV on the wall, a small bed, and a window ledge turned into some kind of desk. There was no dresser or any freestanding furniture beside the bed and a single stationary chair at the desk, there were built in drawers into the \u2018Desk\u201d. The carpet had stains, the desk/ledge had water stains, the windows were pretty dirty, and the blinds were not able to easily go down all the way as they would hit the phone or the iPod clock. The shower uses a motel type flimsy curtain that billowed in while showering and allowed water to spray into the rest of the bathroom. Oh and back to the bed, it was very small, I am about 5\u20198\u201d and my feet were at, almost off the edge of the bed!? Reviewing the website and previous reviews I became convinced that I was not in a remodelled room and higher floors would have the best rooms. I decided to take the lift and randomly look at floors above. Between my exploring and stopping on other floors to pick up passengers I saw four different floors. Looking out of the lift I saw the same dirty carpets and walls. I also did discover a large trash bag in my lift lobby and an odd curtain with objects protruding. After a quick check behind the curtain, I discovered that the last meter or so of hallway was actually the maid closet using a curtain, this same curtain I saw on all floors I stopped on. My last night there, the bar across the street was really going strong and from my room I could hear every note of the music. I was able to fall asleep only to wake up at 5 something to sounds of heavy machinery outside. Looking at the website, and seeing signs in the lobby I have high hopes for their eventual remodel, however it is not there yet. The remodel will take time and I have not seen any signs of construction beginning.
