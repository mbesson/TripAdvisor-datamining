El parador is right off route 116, very accessible and easy to get. The entrance is quite impressive with a large fountain and magnificent trees. They do offer a good breakfast and meals. The service was great and folks are very hospitable. I checked in with the security guard as I arrived after hours, but they definetely earned a 5 star on service the night we checked in. I stayed with my wife for a romantic getaway, and we truly enjoyed it. It wasn't overprized as management offers some good deals on the weekdays. The price on a weekend is another story. It is one of those experiences that you have to live to tell your own tale. For us it was a pleasant one. It is a good place to get away from the overprized run city hotel rooms, or beach houses in the area. Plus, you get to see the country side of Puerto Rico. If it is for a couple and you want to get a taste of the 1930's, I will recommend it.

As a history enthusiast I appreciate the fact that the property has been restored to it's original purpose as a hotel (originally part of the company town supporting the Guanica sugar mill). That however, means that it sits in a mangrove so if you are looking or a place where you can step out of the room and walk to a sandy beach, this may not be the place for you.

The room cost includes meals, which is good because there are not a lot of places to eat good food nearby. The food was good but the dessert flan was the worst flan I have ever eaten. They do not have a liquor license - something about being too close to the church across the street. So, if you like to imbibe, be sure to bring your own.

They were also nice enough to let us check in early, at 7AM, since we arrived so early. However, the rooms were a big disappointment. The rooms are very small, and have a moldy stench to them, especially the bathroom. The outlet in the bathroom was not working, therefore I had to plug the hairdryer and straightening iron in the outlet by the TV, so we had to unplug the TV and microwave, which made it very difficult to do my hair without a mirror. They said they would send someone to repair it, but never did. The only other outlet available was by the bed, but it was being used by the lamp and alarm clock. We had to unplug those in order to charge our phones, so we had no lamp and alarm clock. Our phone was also not working, which they also said they would send someone to repair it and never did. There was no outlet to plug the coffee machine in either, since everything was being used before we even started plugging our stuff in. They didnt give enough towels in the bathroom. The only way to control the AC was an on/off button. There was no way of adjusting the temperature. So we would turn it on and off every 10 minutes literally, because it would get too cold in there very fast, but it would become very humid if it was off for longer than 10-15 minutes. There was no fitted sheet on the bed. Instead it was just a regular sheet tucked under the mattress, which wasn't long enough to cover the whole mattress. About 8 inches at the end of the mattress was exposed, which you would feel when you got into bed. So we had to take a sheet from the other bed and cover it, because the mattress was not that great looking, let alone how rough it felt on our feet. Another thing about the shower, there is only a tiny little soap dish in there. Everything else we used in the shower had to be put on the floor. The hair dryer even had an old moldy smell coming out of it. All in all, it was a great location for us, since it was close to where we wanted to be.

The staff was friendly, if a bit too laid-back, and we only encountered one problem--upon check-in they couldn't find our reservation. Luckily, I had the confirmation number, so they were able to retrieve my paperwork. (Our reservation information, inexplicably, was at a different hotel location.) This mix-up was easily solved and a minor inconvenience that did not affect the rest of our stay.", "Date": "April 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, IA", "Title": "\u201cQuiet, historical, convenient\u201d", "Author": "IA_rover", "ReviewID": "UR6149391", "Content": "Parador Guanica 1929 is definitely not for the resort crowd. However, for those who want quiet, safe lodgings as a jumping off spot for exploring the southwest part of Puerto Rico, this hotel is fine. The rooms are smallish, but in line with other old, historic hotels. The beds are comfortable, the grounds clean and the staff pleasant. We arrived exhausted and missing our luggage after an overnight flight. The manager (Alana) was very helpful. She had our room cleaned and opened for us very early. All of the staff were quite friendly. Using the hotel as a base, we traveled around the area exploring the Guanica dry forest, the Toro Negro cloud forest, and various towns in and around the area. The hotel is on route 3116, which connects to 116 just west of Guanica, and at Ensenada farther west. It's easier to find from the Guanica side, but not tough either way. (Hotels.com's directions were way, way wrong!) The previous reviewers are right, there's not much in the way of restaurants in the area. In general, I was disappointed with food in Puerto Rico. Except for roadside stands (where we had the best food) prices were high, and I didn't find the food all that great. The breakfasts at the hotel were OK, but uninspired. Eggs, ham, a dab of mashed potatoes with sofrito, toast, and a tiny wedge of watermelon. I had fantasized about mounds of tropical fruits, and never found anything resembling my dreams. Somehow, white bread toast and Kraft jelly doesn't cut it. They don't start serving breakfast until fairly late in the morning, too. This meant that we didn't get on the road to our next adventure until nearly 10:00 most days. It gets hot quickly in this part of the island. There are generators on the property, as there are on many isolated business properties in the area. There was a power outage one morning. They fired up the generator, and we had power again within a minute. Other than the one or two hours that the generator ran during the outage, the electricity was on and the generators silent. We visited with the owner of the hotel one morning towards the end of our stay. He also owns two properties on the east end of the island. He offered to transfer our last pre-paid day to one of the other hotels so we could go to El Yunque (the national park on the east end of the island). Although this option is not evident on Hotels.com, they are quite willing to transfer. The menu at the other hotel was exactly the same. Bottom line, you get a quiet, safe place to stay while you explore the area. We felt like we were the only guests there - we only saw a handful of other people the entire time we stayed at Parador Guanica 1929. I would go back and stay again to continue to explore the area. I might try to opt out of the breakfast, though.", "Date": "November 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, P.R.", "Title": "\u201cGreat Deal\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5356121", "Content": "I stayed with my family for a weekend, and it was better than I expected.

We loved the \"off the beaten track\" location - near some gorgeous beaches and 40 minutes from both Ponce and the West Coast of PR. The local restaurants and taverns are not likely gathering spots for tourists... HG 1929 is a historic property, leased to the owner/operator with some bureaucratic stumbling blocks. The electrical rewiring is waiting for PR government certification, and the generator that was to be on site for 30 days has been noisly operating for 1 yr. The guest room windows cannot be replaced, and they can't be opened either. This gives the small rooms a cell-like quality, a shame given the nice and comfortable furnishings, modern bathroom, and efficient A/C. The staff is bilingual and lovely. Paradores feature on site restaurants, and HG 1929 has a pleasant indoor/outdoor cafe on the property. We don't agree with previous reviewers who claim it is the \"worst food on the plantet,\" but having stayed in two properties owned by this family, we are glad we did not opt for the inclusive packages. The food is adequate, but not worth the ala carte prices.
