Hotel Bassano uses swipe card (as opposed to keys) to access rooms and the front door to the hotel is locked with access quickly gained from 24 hour staff at the main desk. From the moment we walked into Hotel Bassano, we felt at home and welcome, due largely to 'Ali' the very kind and knowledgeable man who is one of the hotel's staff attending to the front desk. There is a small business center with computer and printer, a bar, lounge and an overall willingness among staff to make your staff pleasant and to address any needs you may encounter. Hotel Bassano is just a few blocks from the Arch de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower and several wonderful restaurants, boulangeries, shops, fresh produce/fruit markets. A half block away is a 'grocer' offering a modified selection of 7-11 type products including bottled water, juices, cereal, yogurt, toiletries, snacks, etc. Without fail, every staff member we encounted at Hotel Bassano offered a smile and a willing readiness to make our Paris vacation enjoyable.

When I enter a Hotel, I am inspecting everything with my eyes. My husband and I searched and searched for hotels for our Christmas/New Years stay in Paris and saw how this hotel kept coming up for high ratings for a decent price. I was concerned though that the reviews about small rooms would affect things but was pleasantly suprised at the space. So, after all of this we booked the Superior Double (room) for a week. Our flight arrived early (10am) and was still pleasantly greeted by Ali for an early check-in eventhough check-in is not usually until 2pm. The room very clean, neat, more than spacious (for a typical Pais hotel). The location was excellent- about 2 blocks from-- Champs Elysees in which on the Rue de Bassano corner had the George V Metro station stop and the Ultimate Plus- the 2 story LOUIS VUITTON! :) I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again if I ever return to Paris. During our stay, Ali helped recommend places to eat for dinner and gave us copies of Menus with prices for our New Years Dinner from several restaurants. Another front desk lady (I forget her name) she actually called the restaurant and made the New Years reservations for us (my french was poor lol!) Also, when we left for the airport to return back to the U.S. we forgot out Macaroons from Laduree in the room and Antoine (not sure about the spelling?) arranged for a Taxi to come pick-up the Macaroons from the hotel and delivered them to the airport. He even called me to make sure that they arrived at the airport to see if I received them. The downfall is that the taxi charged us a ridiculous price though.

Yellow metro line 1 is very convenient for other main sites - Louvre, Tulleries and direct access to the super station of Chatelet. Also easy downhill walk to Place d'Alma on the Seine for Eiffel Tower viewing, Bateaux-Mouche, Diana homage .... if thats your thing. There is a supermarket 50 metres down the street and a boulangerie literally next door for breakfast. We stayed in the level 6 suite. Hotel Pros: large rooms for Paris - 2 x areas seperated by short passage/bathroom. They made separate beds for the kids which was better than them fighting in a double sofa. Clean modern bathroom. Turn down service. The bedroom actually looked just like the hotel photo when made-up. Little touches - great toiletries, petals in bathroom etc Minor Hotel Cons: flight of steps from level 5 to 6, slowish lift, the beginning signs of wear since the renovation (chipped paint on door etc), a double powerpoint which only allowed one plug to be used at a time. At night you may feel a bit out of it, we pretty much travelled to the Latin Quarter to eat - but Rue Bassano is quiet and after a full day this may be a pro .. More serious hotel cons: The fridge was maybe one degree cooler inside than out which spoilt my initial grocery run (cheese, ham, milk etc) and stopped access to cool drinks. The lack of windows at eye level and below may make some people slightly claustrophobic - though we were fine. I'm sure this is not typical but the aircon was broken for 3 nights and in July on top floor this is serious! After one night we arrived back to find a portable unit (promptly nicknamed the darlek) in the lounge - this was noisy, only sort of did one room and required an open window for the exhaust which was a bit counter productive - but was better than nothing and showed initiative on the part of the hotel. All in all though Paris was probably our favourite city in our London/Rome/Paris trip. The hotel wasn't the best of our trip but it contributed positively to the experience, worked with kids and was definitely was not the downer so easily encountered in London/Paris. Next time I may hunt down an apartment in the Latin area. If not I would probably stay here again.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "JabaGee", "ReviewID": "UR69576322", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights, prior to moving into an apartment for a longer stay in Paris.

Complimentary wifi access was useful, and an in-house computer/printer was great for printing boarding passes prior to our departure. The location is great - a full view of the Eiffel Tower (5 mins walk) greeted my wife's & my bleary eyes at the beginning of our run along the Seine each morning. It's a similar distance from the Champs Elysees and many of the typical tourist monuments that make you feel like you're in Paris. The main downside on location was that we drove to Paris, and the rented GPS unit - bless her robotic heart - kindly directed me to the hotel via the chaotic Arc de Triomphe. As roundabouts go, it makes a good theme park ride - the aftermath is more fun than the experience! (PS street parking was free on Saturdays & Sundays, but in-house parking was expensive at EUR29 - we'd recommend returning the car and using the metro / tour buses). The hotel staff - one gentleman in particular - were fantastically responsive and courteous. Our attempts at French were met by polite responses in English, and our inquiries were followed up during subsequent discussions (e.g. we complained about noise from the room above - a call was made to the room immediately, and we were asked on the next two days whether the issue had been resolved satisfactorily). The room itself was great, which was expected for the price. The king bed (two king singles combined) was very comfortable, and the double glazed windows were effective in reducing noise to a level we could sleep through (we're light sleepers). The main negative issue was the resounding thud whenever the guests above us were either walking heavily or carting bags around ... but with the exception of one family, this was generally limited to daylight hours. We would have liked access to an iron & ironing board for the duration of our stay, but the one time we had one it was removed the next time the room was serviced.

By the way, the hotel recommended Caf\u00e9 de L\u2019Homme for dinner\u2026 unless you want to pay a lot for a view of the Eiffel Tower at night, do yourself a favor and skip it\u2026 service and food were not close to being worth the $. The location was fine, especially at night as it seemed to become very quiet\u2026 you\u2019re very close to the George V Hotel\u2026 highly recommended for great service, a high-priced cocktail, and some celebrity spotting too (Lebron James one of the nights we stopped in).", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nice", "Title": "\u201cgood place to be\u201d", "Author": "gastjunior", "ReviewID": "UR40109666", "Content": "excellent location in center of Paris.

I paid 195 Euros per night including breakfast for a standard room. I caught a taxi to the hotel from Gare St Lazare which cost 7 Euros (on a Sunday with little traffic). The hotel is about a 1km walk from George V metro stop which is on the yellow line (line 1). As you exit the train station take the Rue Georges V exit not the Champs Elysees one and it will bring you out on the rue Bassano side of Champs Elysees. There is an escalator for the last section up to street level. Rue Bassano is right on your left and if you walk about 4 blocks down you'll come to it on the right (it's on a corner). The hotel is modern and rooms really comfortable and large. My room had a king bed (it was 2 twins joined together), a bathroom with a large modern bath and shower over bath and a separate toilet. The bed was very comfortable. The TV had English channels (BBC) as well as French. Breakfast was pretty standard although I did think it was a bit overpriced for 19 Euros. There were limited cereals, bacon, eggs, pastries, cheese, cold meats and fruit. There is a separate bar area which looked quite funky but on the one night I decided to have a drink it was closed and I sat in the breakfast area instead. There is a little computer nook with a brand new MAC computer for free internet use and printing. There is also free wifi in the rooms which worked really well. The hotel is ideally based for those who don't mind walking. It is about a 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, a 5 minute walk to Champs Elysees, 30 minute walk to the Louvre, 45 minute walk to Notre Dame and Latin Quarter. I wouldn't say that the area it is in is particularly vibrant ie. there are not a lot of cafes etc etc but it is a nice quiet area that appears safe. There is a bakery next door, a little bar/cafe opposite and a tapas restaurant a couple of metres down on rue Bassano. I caught a taxi from the hotel to the CDG airport at 8.15am on a Thursday morning and it took about 40 minutes and cost 50 Euros. If you're looking for a great way to see a less touristy side of Paris I'd highly recommend the Bike About Tour (it's number 2 on the Things To Do list for Paris http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d652724-Reviews-Bike_About_Tours-Paris_Ile_de_France.html and gives you a great orientation to the city).", "Date": "July 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Helens England", "Title": "\u201cIt does what it says on the tin\u201d", "Author": "PaulandKim", "ReviewID": "UR34999069", "Content": "I booked a two night stay for my partners 50th birthday, this also coincided with Bastille Day.

The special suprises that I had arranged were all provided as planned, even to discreetly asking if my partner was aware of them and did I want them kept secret. A nice touch I thought.

We stayed there for three nights including New Year's Eve and found it perfectly located for Paris sightseeing. The Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees about five minutes' walk away. The hotel was quiet, and our room, though modestly sized was beautifully appointed with chic French provincial furnishings. The bathroom was big and lavish with L'Occitaine toiletries and fluffy towels. There was also a PC behind the lobby with free 9medium speed) internet for guests which was handy for booking onward arrangements. Reception was quiet and unassuming; we had no outrageous requests but they were cordial and helped us book a couple of tours. Breakfast was not included in the price so we only ate in the hotel one morning - it was plentiful and well-prepared, if a little expensive. There were a couple of good restaurants nearby. As swish an area as Bassano is in, (and let's face it, as lovely as Paris is) I do NOT recommend Paris for New Year's Eve. Reception warned us against gathering at the Eiffel Tower at midnight because of crime and 'hooliganism.' Set menu dinners at any of the nearby restaurants was over 200 euros a head. We ended up staying in and toasting 07 with Champagne and ice cream and were awoken after 2am by drunk revellers, and the sound of breaking glass on the streets outside. On New Year's morning, there were broken liquor bottles and more than a few pools of vomit on the footpaths around the hotel, in addition to the requisite piles of dog poo. A real shame, given how beautiful the city is and how important tourism is to the Parisians that they don't make more of an effort to keep it clean. Nonetheless, the hotel was very pleasant and comfortable, and I would recommend it, especially for couples. I do not agree with the assessment that it's good for families with kids - it's pretty elegantly furnished, quiet, lots of light-coloured soft furnishings, and doesn't lend itself very well to a lot of noise and activity.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mclean VA", "Title": "\u201csmall and stylish\u201d", "Author": "myjourney", "ReviewID": "UR10409844", "Content": "We enjoyed our short stay.

Only complaint is the seperate WC (as most are in France) was right there as you walked in the door, and the shower was on the other side of the room. Kinda strange configuration. We were able to switch to another room for the remaining two nights of our stay. It has a much better configuration, with a small hallway leading into the room, and the WC next to the shower / washroom. Get one of these rooms if you can. Overall the hotel was clean and quiet, even though windows open to the street. Very soundproof windows. There was a few areas where the hotel is showing its age, a little paint peeling here and there. A staff member indicated the entire hotel will soon be undergoing a significant renovation. However it was not that bad and did not detract from our stay. As with the Chesterfield Hotel in London, staff here were excellent, and most helpful in all respects. Location of hotel was one of the features, and we were very happy with being able to walk to le Champs and many major attractions. For breakfast we ate at boulangeries instead of the hotel, and saved about 50% of the cost vs. the hotel. As travellers know, breakfast at any hotel anywhere is usually 2 to 4 times the cost at a \"regular\" local diner. Last day was a Sunday and there was nothing open, so we ate at hotel and it was very good. Had two dinners in Paris, Laduree on the Champs Eleysee (on the recommendation of Frommers, somewhat disappointing) and at La Fermette Malbouf (on the recommendation of the Bassnano), which was truly fantastic.

The rooms were always clean and you were never hunted out of your room for cleaning like in other hotels.

It is a wonderful hotel, made more so by the staff than anything. I had booked the hotel based on reviews from Trip Advisor. It's nicely located near the main streets, and in the middle of the so-called Golden Triangle of Paris. I had booked early last July 2006, and had been in communication with the hotel regarding airport transfers and religious services (as a Catholic, I wanted to know of any nearby churches). The hotel staff, namely Gaelle, Hoa, Ali and Anita, were always up to date and aware of our arrangements. When I arrived, the lift was being repaired, but Saran, the bellhop, kindly lugged my extremely large bag up the steps (up to the 3rd floor, for which I was very grateful!) without complaint. In other places, you'd be hearing quite an earful by then. During our stay, Antoine was on duty at the desk and he was most obliging in helping us confirm our flights, arranging for our taxi, etc. They were all very helpful and friendly, and we appreciated it very much! The hotel is simply but charmingly furnished. The bedsheets were always clean and tidy and a pleasure to sleep in. We had been upgraded to a larger room at no extra cost and throughout our stay, experienced a blissful quiet. We hardly heard or saw anyone, and only during breakfast, if at all. Breakfast is expensive at 18 Euros for the full buffet, but since I was pretty hungry at the time I tried it, it was worth it. Room service is also available, though at certain times only. The food was excellent and arrived at their proper temperatures. If you like quiet neighborhoods (this isn't like St. Germain de Pres where it's chock full of tourists; most of the residents were like us, there primarily on business), then the Hotel Bassano is for you. The Champs Elysees is a few blocks down (literally downhill), and at the end of the street is the very large Loius Vuitton flagship store. If you need a taxi, the hotel staff is eager to help, or if you want to walk a bit, go down Avenue Marceau, there's a reliable stand there, in front of the other property the Bassano is affiliated with, the Hotel Elysees Regencia. The nearest Metro stop is at Kleber on Avenue Kleber, which we used a lot, but if you want to be at the center of things, the George V station is not a bad walk to the Champs Elysees where it's located. I certainly recommend this hotel, great value for money and wonderful hospitality, too, in a city with a reputation for rudeness that in this case is quite undeserved.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cFirst class hotel\u201d", "Author": "edendown", "ReviewID": "UR7567170", "Content": "We have just enjoyed our first stay in Paris, compliments of our daughters, and the Hotel Bassano made the trip a total success.

The room was beautiful and spacious and the staff was extremely courteous and helpful. All of the staff we met spoke very good English, which was good as my French is horrible. The room was cleaned daily very well and the turndown service made my wife feel like a queen. The in room safe was large enough for out laptop (15.4\" wide screen) and all of our other valuables. The TV does get 4 english speaking cable channels. 2 news channels, BBC One and a EuroSports which is in german some of the time. Also has a XXX channel late at night, so be careful of any children you bring. The room also had a HUGE closet large enough to unpack our 3 suitcases into. The location was unbeatable. It was an extremely quiet neighborhood being a couple of blocks off any main streets and within walking distance to just about everything. We even walked to the Louvre and Notre Dame, although it was an extremely long walk and not for the weak at heart. The Metro was easily accessible for those wishing to use it. They were typically crowded but great for getting around and a heck of a lot cheaper than a taxi. Food-wise, we found 2 very good Italian restaurants within walking distance, a pastry shop 2 doors down from the hotel which we used daily and a cute little market a couple of blocks up towards the Arc on Avenue Marceau which always had fresh fruit (best grapes I ever had). Complaints? Only that the toilet area, which is separate from the bathroom was a bit small so I would not recommend it for anyone that is claustrophobic. Definately the best place we ever heard of or found in Paris. We stayed at 2 other hotels this trip, including a 4 star (Le Meridian), and this one outshined them easily.

Location was close to Champs Elysses but somewhat remote from Louvre and Notre Dame", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cVery nice stay\u201d", "Author": "DDouglasF", "ReviewID": "UR6053608", "Content": "We had a very nice three-night stay here in late September. The room was very comfortable and quiet. We didn\u2019t\u2019 hear any noise from the street or from the other rooms. The air conditioning worked fine on a warm afternoon. The d\u00e9cor was tasteful and the storage was adequate. The bathroom, while well equipped, was small even by Paris standards. Having stayed at the Hotel San Gregoire (6th) at the beginning of our trip, we had been spoiled by a larger bathroom. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The neighborhood was safe and a brief walk from the Champs Elysees and the Metro. We didn\u2019t try the breakfast, but there were a number of cafes close by. I would highly recommend this hotel for people wanting to stay on the Right Bank and close to the Champs Elysees. We tried three restaurants during our stay here with mixed results. We had a great time at the L\u2019Angle du Faubourg (the second line restaurant of the three star Taillevent), which is a brisk 15-minute walk from the hotel. The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all top notch. They have a great 35 Euro menu at dinner, but you have to ask for it. It is posted outside, but the printed menu presented at table mentions only the 70 Euro menu and the expensive a la carte. The less expensive pre-fix menu is three courses and well worth asking for. Our impressions of the other restaurants we tried were mixed. The Citrus Etoile near the Arc de Triomphe was like being at home-California cuisine. The chef here had done a ten-year stint in southern California. The place is lots of fun and the chef\u2019s US-born wife, a former model, runs the dining room. The first course of smoked Scottish salmon was out of this world, but the main course of roasted salmon was less appealing. Maybe it was too hard an act to follow after the wonderful first course or maybe I had too much salmon. The dessert of fresh sorbets was very good. I recommend going here because of the smoked salmon, a good wine list (2004 Domaine Laroche Chablis for 30 Euro), the pleasant atmosphere and the caring service. The lighter touch on the food might be an interesting change if one has been dining on richer, more traditional cuisine. The third night we dined at Flora, a five-minute walk from the hotel. The experience here was bizarre. We arrived on time for our 9:00 P.M. reservation, but it took an hour to get any food. The staff seemed overwhelmed by the packed restaurant. The first course, a fish soup, was tasty, but things went downhill from there. We had been tempted by the menu description of a fresh swordfish brochette. However, when the meal arrived, we found an over-cooked piece of fish that had been coated with not very interesting spices with a skewer stuck through it. My wife could not finish her meal. The waitress inquired as to why she didn\u2019t finish her meal. To our regret, we told her that the fish was dried out. The waitress immediately picked up the plate, took my wife\u2019s fork and began mashing the leftover fish into a mushy paste. From then on, we were practically ignored. Our dessert was brought in silence and we never offered coffee. At the end of the meal the chef came out and greeted each table. If my French had been better, I would have tried to complain. At that point, we just wanted to leave. I had to retrieve our coats from the cloak closet, as none of the staff was around to help. I strongly suggest you avoid Flora.", "Date": "November 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent friendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "London-lover-forever", "ReviewID": "UR6030492", "Content": "Excellent hotel!

This little hotel therefore had a lot to live up to. And it did. And how! We were given an early check in to our suite. I'm not telling you the room number since I want to try as much as possible to ensure that it is available when we want to go back! Our suite had a bedroom, a sitting room with a fold out double sofa bed and a kitchenette with a fridge. Not a mini bar, although it served that purpose as well but a fridge. As a mother travelling with her son, this was the icing on the cake. I could wash bubba's bottles and store his milk and food hygienically which is more than I can say for the Disneyland Hotel. There was a huge bathroom and a separate toilet, clever people! Our bed was scattered with flower petals when we arrived. We ooh-ed and aah-ed over the rooms and went out. 5 minutes later saw us posing in front of the Arc de Triomphe following a leisurely stroll down Champs Elyssee. The location is perfect for sightseeing and aimless wandering around the heart of Paris. The staff are the best I have found anywhere. They cannot do enough for their guests. They all speak great English which is just as well as my schoolgirl French was a little embarrassing! To any future guests, be careful which hotel you book as there are two hotel Bassanos directly across from each other. Since I haven't stayed in the other one I\u2019m not going to comment on it but this review is about the 4 star one at 15 rue de Bassano. I could write about this hotel forever. In the same fortnight we had stayed in the Waldorf Astoria in New York and as mentioned, Disneyland Hotel and in a nutshell this hotel wipes the floor with both of them. Give yourself a present and stay here. It's now joined my list of 'Reasons to go to Paris'! I will post pictures later but can confirm that unlike other hotel websites, what you see on the hotel Bassano website is exactly what you get.

This was the only hotel with nothing negative in the reviews. It also provided accomodations for four people which was what we were looking for. Extremely clean, spacious rooms with beautiful decor, very nice marble bathrooms with bathroom robes. The staff was very friendly, helpful and always there for you to answer any questions or to book any restaurant. Breakfast was lovely (it was included in our price) and served in a nice breakfast area. I just cannot find anything bad to say. Big windows opened to a very quiet small street. The metro station was a short walk (right on Champs Elysees). Great restaurants nearby, \"Asian\" is a must. Very friendly service and amazing food.
