Nobody meeting you at the door. Just go to the counter while some snotty rude guy rambles directions and shoves bracelets and room and towel keys and whatever else at us. Rude, unpleasant, impatient. Was a confusing expereience. * 1st room leak above tub. Ceiling was stainled brown all across, not just where the leak was. Clearly not a new development or problem. Seemed to want to try to make repairs. Only moved us to another room after we spoke up and told them we want to unpack not wait for some repair. * 2nd room shower head spraying in all different directions. Was fixed promptly. * Constant running water throughout the walls. I don't mean shower noise, I mean like there is a leak somewhere and water is going all over inside the walls. * Can hear the people upstairs from us as if they were outside our door. * Pool was dirty, foggy, and low on water the 1st two days we were there. Did not swim in it on those days. * Lounge chairs were almost all damaged, fabric was ripped and majorly worn so that they sunk so deep when you sat in them that you could barely get back out. disgusting. * Lounge chairs dirty/filthy with food and bird poop. disgusting. * Seagulls and blackbirds all over the place. Not a single soul to do anything to keep them away. Perhaps a bit unrealistic, but for a supposed 4 star resort they certainly should try. 3 out of 5 of us got crapped on. I think that would be considered problematic, not just plain old nature.The birds were bathing in the pool. * Food remnants and an empty plastic cup on a particular platform in the pool. Never did see anyone remove it. Remained there for 2 hours while my friend & I sat by the pool, and was still there when we went back to our room to get ready to go out. * Drinks were disgusting made of syrup and virtually no alcohol in them. NO REAL FRUIT?? Really?? seriously the worst drinks I've ever had. If you can even call them cocktails... terrible. * Same music in the \"club\" area as well as the swim area every single day. Same songs over and over and over, blaring so loud in the bar even when nobody was even in there. * One day while sitting in a chair by the pool, one of the activity/recreation guys came and asked if I wanted to play bingo. I told him no. He said \"yes?\" I said no again. He says why not. I say irritably \"because I don't feel like playing\" . He says \"are you mad, what's wrong?\" rudely to me, as if I'm the problem. I say \"i'm not mad, I just simply do not want to play any games\". Point: Why the hell do I have to be badgered? He should have accepted my answer and left me alone. I didn't think this was amusing. He apparently did. * Noticed in the buffet restaurant that the tables were not actually wiped down fully when guests were done eating. The servers essentially just brushed whatever crumbs off the placemats, did a general swipe if the table appeared dirty and that was it. Sometimes you would get offered water. sometimes not. NEVER with ice it it. * Chairs in dining area of the buffet restaurant were filthy. One breakfast, they sat us at what appeared to be a lovely long table with white coverings over the chairs. Looked nice at first, but every single chair cover had food or some type of sauce literally splattered all over it. There literally was not one single day that I did not have to brush specks of food off of my chair before sitting down. Disgusting. * Noticed that dirty dishes tended to sit outside of rooms for huge amounts of time before they were ever collected. This happened twice for my roomat and I. Once with the remnants of the fruite plate, and again with our leftover pizza boxes. * What's up with replacing the water only ever other day, making guests walk around and fill there bottles up? I truley think that is great for the environment, however 1st of all, you know the environment is not their agenda, and secondly I find it absurd and tacky to make people that have paid upwards of $1700.00 go find water. The bottles were too big to fit in the fridge, so you essentially had to drink them warm, or transfer them into smaller bottles THAT HAD TO BE PURCHASED, in order to fit and put them in the fridge to get cold. Tacky! * noticed throughout the facility broken tiles, dirty paint, and our shower even had some random hole in the ceiling that appeared to be drilled. (hope they had a good show! lol) * Not a single ice machine to be found anywhere throughout the whole facility. * No channels came in on the T.V * Had to pay extra to get access to the safe in the room. Absurd *Constant work being done every single day. Always banging and hammering etc. It was painfully clear in every aspect regarding the facility/\"resort\" from restaurants, to ammenities or lack thereof, right down to employee's rude and non-caring insincere behavior that this \"resort\" is simply in it for money money money, with not a care in the world regarding the comfort of their patrons. I have stayed in motels that are in better shape and have nicer employees that this place! I am thourouly disgusted with this resort. I saved for two years to be able to take a relaxing vacation in a beautiful place.

Left Toronto early am, arriving Cancun 9am..shuttle to Playa for 1+ hours....so we were there by noon. This is a smaller AI, which we prefer for the personal touch, which is what you get here. Every one is friendly, accommodating and eager to please. Upon checking into our room, there was a water leak in our bathroom which our bellboy reported to maintenance and they were there in 10 min. It took them 2 hr to fix but they cleaned up afterwards and never had anymore problems. The hotel was full and some days had difficulty finding chairs around pool/beach. The beach is rather small due to tides and on some days was no wider than one lounge chair. Location is great, 4 blocks to start of pedestrian 5th ave shopping district...awesome!! we went several times during our stay. You can walk the beach or go over one and up 2 blocks then turn left. Always felt safe and everyone is friendly. Ate & drank at several places on 5th, and was great. Food at the resort, although bland for our taste, was adequate and varied. Service was mostly great. Spa was amazing..Betty does great massages. The only thing missing was an outdoor sitting area, in the evenings it is nice to sit outdoors after dinner to enjoy the weather, evening breezes. The sitting area around the pool bar and snack bar is great for eating although I found it hard to get a seat at times as people tended to sit and drink there all day. Another issue is the rental \"beds\" at the beach area. There were at least 8 of them set up and only saw 2 rented all week. They take up so much room and are a lot of work for the lad working on the beach. We watched him endlessly taking the mattresses & drapes in & out daily. When the beach is so short of space, these things need to go..2 or 3 are sufficient. We also took several excursions - booked through services at the hotel - visiting mayan ruins and the repelling into cenote - don't miss; also went camel riding...absolutely great..a lovely walk to the ocean guided on foot (we were on the camels)with the 3 employees who took pics & video of us along the way, explained the camel operation, local landscape, culture. Overall a great trip..including the tire blowout on the bus to the airport at 8pm. A replacement bus/luggage transfer was handled so quick.

They change the themes every night with some being better than others. 5 of us went ages ranging from 27-40, and all of us had a great time. Close to 5th avenue for all your shopping needs and a 5 minute ride to the ferry if you want to visit Cozumel for a day. Any complaints i would have would be for the fridge to be stocked daily rather than every other day. A cheaper rate on wireless hook up, 15$ a day is a little steep, and lastly not that we watched much tv but picture wasnt that great.

The primary perk for us was that it was a 10 min walk to 5th Ave, which is a lovely 45 minute stroll that parallels the ocean (one block away) and is full of great shops, restaurants and bars. The hotel is small - about 280 rooms. It had a lobby, lobby bar, one pool and pool bar, a couple of shops, a buffet restaurant, 2 a la carte restaurants and a small disco. The rooms are in a U shape and overlook the pool area. It is an all-inclusive. The beach is small and there are many boats moored in the ocean off the beach. You can walk along the beach in either direction, though, beyond the resort property. You can also use public beaches in the area. We were not \"hassled\" by anyone on the beach. There were few to no biting bugs (some tiny ants?) around the washroom sink in your room - no big deal. This was a huge relief for me as I have an allergic reaction to Caribbean mosquitos! The place was always really clean, the staff was great and the food was good. Also, the alcoholic beverages were good. (try a Mudslide!) We went to the Mexican a la carte and our friends went to the Italian a la carte. Both experiences were positive. For all the bad press Mexico has gotten over the violence against tourists, we were rather apprehensive, but we did not experience any problems at all. 5th Ave is always full of tourists and all that we saw was shop staff beckoning for business. A smile and a non, gracias, was sufficient to be left alone. I am a middle-aged female and walked into town 3-4 times alone, wandered about (mostly stuck to 5th Ave, but went a bit off it a couple of times) and never felt unsafe. Of course, I was sober, attentive and not being an idiot so that always helps. The hotel's pretty basic but was nice and we would go back. The only reason we wouldn't would be to try a new place or if we got a better deal elsewhere. We were there the 1st week of March and paid about $1100 p/p, flight, hotel and bus to and from the Cancun airport. The bus ride was about 1hr 15mins.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gatineau, Quebec, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAwesome times at Grand Coco Bay !!!\u201d", "Author": "Janvitos", "ReviewID": "UR126019764", "Content": "So I went to Grand Coco Bay for Quebec spring break which lands on the first week of March (4th to 11th). I traveled with my girlfriend and both of her parents for a full week of fun and sun. Fun and some good sun we got, but what I wasn't expecting is this more than amazing experience at this resort. First of all, I really want to say, like other reviewers said, the staff all around the resort is simply awesome. These people are friendly, helpful, kind and I was already missing them the first day I got back home. Whether you like to sit at the bar for a drink, take a few salsa lessons by the pool or simply learn some Spanish by the beach, there's always someone to have fun with. Also, this was my second time traveling to Playa Del Carmen and I can say the food was very good at Grand Coco Bay. I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food but this had a lot of meats and fish which I really love. The taste was always better than I expected and for a small resort, there was good diversity. If you want to have a fancy experience, there's always the a-la-carte restaurants which have great food and a relaxing atmosphere. The rooms were basic but clean and there were no bugs or anything of the sort to be seen. I can say that for anyone who likes to sleep on a soft bed, these might be a bit hard but that's how I like them so no problem there for me. The nightlife wasn't the big attraction of this hotel but there was always some late fun at the lobby. This hotel is about 25 minutes walk from all the nightclubs and a taxi ride is only about 50 pesos (less than 5$ USD). What was really great though is that we got advice from the entertainment crew for some great Playa Del Carmen nightly action. Some of the crew even came with us at a bar called La Bodeguita which played some nice Latino music and where we had a blast. So in all honesty, I would recommend this resort to anyone. If you are looking for a huge place with five lobbies and ten buffets, this might be a bit too small for you. But for every other reason, be it the food, the staff or the general quality of the resort, this is a real four and a half star for me. Will I go back? Absolutely !

When he mentioned his disappointment to the maitre d', he was immediately offered his choice of any other meal on the menu. We were very impressed. The only major drawback was the noise level. The sound from the lobby bar carries up to the rooms and can go well into the early hours. Also the noise from the hallway comes through loudly. The pool area could do with more shaded areas.

I have to say my experience proved the negative reviews all wrong! We had a group of 19 ranging in age from 14 to 73. We all enjoyed ourselves very much. The only two complaints I had were...1) like others I did not like the beach chair situation. There are not nearly enough chairs for the amount of guests and they were all saved by early morning. My parents would have loved to sit at the beach in the shade and watch the activities the rest of the family were involved with, but there was no chairs available and even less places for shade. 2) I think they are very understaffed. Those that are there work very hard and can not keep up with the amount of people (bars, restraunts, entertainment), resulting in long waits for drinks, coffee etc. Other than that it was great! Good food (especially the special dinner show), everything was very clean..there was even a person raking seaweed at the beach ALL day. I don't remember names of all the staff(I would probably leave someone out) but they were all very friendly and helpful. Some people have complained about the boats in the water, but no one in our party thought it was a negative. There are some issues with things like airconditioners in the rooms, but it is an older building so that is to be expected. I liked the small size of the resort, we were able to do our own things, yet see others in our group and keep an eye on the numerous teenagers that were with us.

The food was very good and the presentaton astounding. The activity staff was very good at getting people involved without being overbearing. They were also very entertaining. The rooms were basic and if there is one thing that needs to be upgraded is the rooms but hey, you sleep and you hit the pool or beach. The bed was comfy and there was an abundance of pillows. Now this too me is the quality of this resort. We met another couple from the USA. We hit it off and were going on an excusion on Wed together. That morning he had difficulty breathing. The staff was there immediatley with oxygen, the hotel Doctor was ther within minutes and an ambulance soon followed. The reaction time was amazing. The Lomas travel customer service manager even went to the hospital, and stayed in the waiting room and then drove the couple back to the resort when he was released. They even assisted in getting them a flight back to the states within hours of the request. That is what you want, in an emergency, you want the staff to respond properly and this staff did just that. That can't be taught, it just is the quality of this staff. Here is another amazing story. My brother came by (from Cancun) and we jumped a taxi to 5th Ave. He left his camera in the taxi. He went back to Grand Coco Bay, and asked the security to see if the cab driver had his camera. The next morning I get a call, went to the lobby, the cab driver was there with the camera and also showed me the $200 in US dollars was still in the camera pouch. I was again amazed. As for other finds... down the beach, 50 yards, 1 hour full massages for $30 US... amazing....and so much less than the resort. We had 3 massages. The Camel excursion, recommended by Juan Carlos with Lomas was a must do!.... The silver shop in the lobby, a great selection and the prices were resonable and negotiable. The nightly shows were entertaining and good quality. The drinks were just fine and no skimping on the alcohol mixes. I understand the resort will be under new ownership as of March 1. I can only hope they can improve the rooms cosmetically, but they have outstanding service already in place. While not a 5 star resort, its smaller size, its staff, and its quality of the grounds certainly makes this a must stay. I have been visiting Mexico for 15 years, I am not new to the country and not easily impressed but...We loved Grand Coco Bay and will certainly return.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lethbridge, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA perfect beginner vacation spot\u201d", "Author": "Pacifica911", "ReviewID": "UR125204296", "Content": "The Grand Coco Bay is a perfect vacation spot for first times to the all inclusive caribbean vacation. We travelled with a group of 11 people, all family. The size of the resort was perfect for the purpose of our trip. It's was small enough that we easily found each other throughout the day without having to set a timeframe to see each other. Overall the resort is very basic and plain but great for your average \"one week to Mexico kind of place\". Positives: the resort itself it quite beautiful with all the amenities in the middle such as a nice large pool, snack bar, restaurants, bar etc. the staff were all very friendly and all deserve to be tipped here and there. If you don't like leaving the resort, vendors come in at different times throughout the week so you can do some shopping. There are no independent vendors allowed to stroll the beaches here, so no constant harassing for necklaces, braiding etc etc. the pool is great! Nice and big. The overall cleanliness is quite good. I think the hotel has some wear and tear to it, but I think that's to be expected. The Mayan Riviera itself is very nice, seems well maintained. I would almost say \"ritzy\", having been toother areas from the Caribbean. There is lots to do in this area for everyone and anyone, just costs lots of dineros. Negatives: The beach that belongs to the resort is quite small. A lot of people were reserving chairs under the huts the night before and I didn't think that was fair. There aren't a lot of water sports included like snorkel/glass bottom boat and catamaran, which are things we really like to do. There isn't much to do for kids here except swim. But there is a \"mini disco\" for them at 8 everyday. The rooms are very very basic. The beds were pretty hard, a bit run down. We had a leak in our room due to the air conditioner, but they came to fix it right away. We had some little fruit flies in our bathroom, but with some bug spray took care of that. I found that if you don't leave food or drinks open in your room, they don't really come. There is a show at night, some were good, some were ok. It was justbtoo bad there wasnt any nightlife outside, such as a live band. The food is also very plain. It's good, but nothing fancy. For example, I was looking forward to seafood night all week, but all there was for seafood was a bit of shrimp (little ones) and some mussels. But I have to say we were quite spoiled at \"beaches sandy bay\". Last thing, I thought it was kind of expensive for the wifi ($80) for the week. Overall, we had a great time. I suggest you pay with pesos in the town, I think you get better prices and easier bartering. Taxis are an easy way to get around, just negotiate a little. There are cheaper ways to do things, just ask....", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ely, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time\u201d", "Author": "Noez1", "ReviewID": "UR124576133", "Content": "I am starting this review on my I-Pad while at the resort.\u00a0 We were here from the 4th to the 11th.\u00a0 It is now a little after 7am. \u00a0 90% of the pool chairs and beach chairs have towels and other items on them. \u00a0I have watched people put one towel on two chairs and then walk to the beach and do the same. \u00a0 So, \u00a075% of the time chairs will not be able to be used by other people. \u00a0 \u00a0 It Kept getting worse as the week went on.\u00a0 \u00a0This is our second room that we have been in.

We called the front desk to have it opened, and although they sent someone right away , the \u00a0worker could not get it opened. \u00a0 He left, and was never seen again. \u00a0 We laughed when we realized the safe was not even attached to the wall, you could pick it up and walk out of the room with it if you wanted to! \u00a0Although we spoke with the desk personal numerous times, nothing was done about it. Approximately 80% of \u00a0the people are \u00a0French Canadian, 10% American, the rest from all over. \u00a0 English will not be the language most spoken here. This could change from week to week tho. \u00a0Food. \u00a0 Buffet is typical of a 3.5 star resort. Taste is subjective. Not a whole lot of variety, so it becomes boring after a few days. \u00a0 Theme \u00a0nights will offer different choices so be sure to make use of them. \u00a0Overall, the food was good and rarely no complaints, just remember, it is a buffet. \u00a0There are also two \u00a0restaurants on site, \u00a0Italian and Mexican which are very good. \u00a0The snack bar has a good variety of food that can break up the buffet routine. \u00a0 \u00a0I found the coffee to be terrible. \u00a0 \u00a0The beach is small but adequate. \u00a0The boats moored out front can be either a eye sight or in my opinion, an addition to the ocean ambience. \u00a0 Along with 3 hot tubs, The pool is warm and clean.\u00a0 The \u00a0front \u00a0desk is very helpful and cheerful as long as you treat them with the respect they deserve. \u00a0Would I stay again? Yes. \u00a0 First time travelers will have different opinions but this hotel is typical of the 3 -3.5 star rating. \u00a0 Remember \"Star\" ratings are different in Mexico then elsewhere.\u00a0 \u00a0This was our 14th trip to Mexico, we have stayed at better rated places, this is what we expected for the price.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cLoved Grand Coco Bay!\u201d", "Author": "Amy L", "ReviewID": "UR124538625", "Content": "My husband and I just returned from our first trip to Grand Coco Bay and we loved it!

The people there work so hard and it seemed they worked very long hours, but always with a smile. We could always hear one of the workers whistling in the evenings while cleaning up the buffet area after dinner, which we found charming. We left a buck or two tip here and there for drinks, after dinner, etc., but were never made to feel it was expected at the resort. There were a few restaurants to choose from, but we usually ate at the buffet or the snack bar near the pool, We chose Coco Bay partly because at the price we paid we could still go eat a few dinners on 5th Ave, and not feel guilty about spending the money. This was our second time to Playa and we love the beach and 5th Ave. The beach at the hotel was excellent and we had a beautiful view of the pool and the ocean from our room. One bit of advice.......if you want a lounge chair on the beach or by the pool better get up early because every chair usually was reserved with a towel by 8 a.m., which was frustrating since many of the chairs would sit all day reserved with no one in them. The drinks at the bars were great. Antonio and Richard were great bartenders. Lydia, the operator you get when calling the front desk from your room, was wonderful. We met so many nice people from Minnesota at the resort. Most of the guests at the resort seemed laid back and fun-loving. This is not an over-priced, stuffy resort.

Playa Del Carmen is a great place to shop and prices are reasonable...you need to check out multiple stores as prices very and some will barter with you.

Coco Bay is a small resort, the swimming pool, restaurants and beach is right outside your bedroom door. The mood of the resort is slow and relaxing. Every one of the resort staff are so very friendly, they are all so willing to stop and talk, always asking if there is anything they can do for you today. We have stayed at larger 5 stars resorts where the staff is so busy tending to the large number of guests that they do not have time to stop and say hola. We were able to become good friends with almost every one of the resort staff we talked to, which is why staying at this resort is so special. It is like visiting with a family member. The bell hops, Alermo or Victor are the first persons to greet us as we get out of the airport transfer. They always greet with a warm welcome, smile and handshake. They unload the baggage and direct us to the lobby to check in. As we get to the check in desk we are greeted by Alfonso and Zoila who attend to us the minute we approach the desk. Check in process is fast and straightforward. We are given room keys, towel keys, AI bracelet and the opportunity to rent the in room safe. Alfonso was able to switch our room from the third floor down to the ground floor without any hesitation. During check in we are handed a moist towel and a glass of champagne. With check in complete, we meet Alermo at our room as he delivered our baggage, and gives us a tour of our room explains how to use the room safe, verifies the TV remote is operational and explains how frequently the soda and beer is restocked in our room refrigerator. Our room was very clean and we had no problem sleeping. The buffet has a wonderful breakfast; I especially enjoy the omelet and waffle station. Our waitress, \u201cGabriella surprised us during lunch on the day of our anniversary by bringing us a cake with the words happy anniversary on it. Adelmira was very efficient with the coffee pot so early in the morning. At lunch we always started with a salad. Then onto what the cook was fixing. Was so delicious. Every night they have a different theme which gives variety. Bernardo was our waiter on most evenings; he was always running and with a smile on his face. One night I was not feeling well, stomach ache, chills, (dang flu in Mexico) and the captain asked if they could make me some chicken soup. I thought that was so thoughtful. But then again, that is what this resort is like. (I had yogurt & it did the job). Now let\u2019s be real\u2026 Yes, at times it is the same kind of food. They have what 20 different dishes. Not sure about you but at my house I DO NOT serve that kind of variety. So change it up\u2026. The only bad food I had there was one time the beans were a bit salty for me. The next morning they were back normal. All the buffet staff is extremely nice and efficient. I wish I could name them all. There are two specialty restaurants, Mexican and Italian that require men to wear pants and close toed shoes. The food at both restaurants is very good. Reservations for the specialty restaurant can be made at the buffet in the morning. Please, try either one or both. The food is DELISH!!! The service is beyond 5 stars. We enjoyed the service provided by Samuel & Francisco in the Italian restaurant. After dinner Francisco would bring me a cup of coffee and Wassel cream liquor which was very good. The snack bar is out by the swimming pool. It is open during the afternoon and late at night and serves pizza, hamburgers nachos and other yummy snacks. Pool Bar\u2026 \uf04a well delish drinks, not short on alcohol, service with a smile, and they are busy but what pool bar is not, right\u2026. These guys work very hard 6 days a week so it never hurts to leave some pesos to show your thanks. Luis at the buffet can make a great variety of drinks, just ask, he can do it. There is also a bar in the lobby and a sports bar. Well shoot, you will get great service at all the bars and restaurants. The beach has been losing ground for a while. We were in Playa last year and the beach was huge. So in a year\u2019s time it has lost so much ground. This makes me so sad but not sure how that would be any resorts fault. The beach with white sand and turquoise water is beautiful. The cool breeze coming off the ocean kept the temperature comfortable. The U shape of the resort facing the ocean allows the cool breeze to blow over the swimming pool and lounge chairs having a similar cooling effect. If it got too hot we would jump into the pool or into the ocean to cool off. We spent a lot of time lounging at both the beach and pool with a cold beverage. On one afternoon of lounging on the beach I had discovered I did not have my camera. Earlier on I had taken a stroll on the beach and was taking pictures. I placed the camera in my pocket and it apparently fell out. I walked up to the main lobby and found Alermo and asked if they had a lost and found and if a camera had been found. He immediately phoned the resort security, at that time there was no report of a camera. I did not think I would ever see that camera again. Later on in the afternoon we were lounging near the pool and Alermo comes up to me and tells me that the beach security guard had found my camera, which was amazing! I was so surprised. Since I had my camera back I was able to take more pictures while taking walks on the beach. The location of GCB is close enough to allow you to walk down the beach to 5th Avenue to shop. We would stop on our walk at a beach club and have a cold beverage and some ceviche. The entertainment staff at the resort provides various activities throughout the day; I enjoyed playing beach volley ball. The nice thing about this entertainment staff is that they don\u2019t nag you to join in the activities. Some resorts they nag to no end. In the evenings after dinner the entertainment staff would provide a nightly show. My favorite was the Mexican show with all its color, dance and music. If you are looking for a warm charming place to spend your vacation, I highly recommend staying at GCB. We will be staying there on our next vacation to Playa Del Carmen. Grand Coco Bay staff goes above and beyond their duties; they take the extra step to make your stay better. I will be returning many more times.

Service in the buffet was great, and I found the staff young and very enthusiastic at all times. Probably my biggest complaint, as I came to mayan for the beach/ocean, was the size of our beach. It was very small and I was out of my room every morning by 8am to ensure I had a lounger on the beach. Also, I think our area on the water was a place to doc boats...so at all times, I could smell boat gas and would have to swim on the far sides of the water to go our further. Nightly entertainment was good on a couple nights, but there were 2-3 nights where it was terrible. Seemed like they had a cancellation and had to scramble to get staff to do some comedy routines. Our room and bathroom were large and clean (no bugs!). Location - really close to shopping and as long as you stay on lighted streets, very safe.

The beach and ocean was beautiful, white sand, turquoise water and not too big waves. There were lots of boats but it didn\u2019t bother us either to view or swimming because they were further out in the sea.

We also ate at the a la carte restaurants and can recommend them both. But the best thing was the snack bar. Lots of different choices and what we ate was very tasty. The drinks were ok. The alcohol might have been watered down but the drinks were included in the all-inclusive so you could just drink more of them. All the staff were very polite and nice. We never saw any Time Share people and the team that organized activities were funny and not pushy. If we didn\u2019t want to join we just said a politely no. It took about 10 minutes to walk to the shopping street on 5 Avenue. In the evening it could be a little dark to walk but we felt safe all the time. To the bus station, collectivos, and Wallmart it took about 20-30 minutes to walk. The collectivos was a really good alternative for transportation. Just make sure that the driver knows where you are getting off. Bring lots of small value in dollar or pesos, as you will be tipping a lot. It may also be useful to know a few Spanish phrases because the Mexicans don\u2019t speak much English. From the airport in Cancun we took the Ado bus for 120 pesos.

The resort offered free snorkeling and kayaks, but only had 2 - 4 of each available for the entire resort!!

We found that this one, rated at 3 stars, was substantially better in both food quality and customer service. The only thing to complain about was the over-zealous time-share sales rep in the lobby (referred to as the \"concierge\" which makes you think they are with the hotel when they are not),. Stay clear of the front lobby if you don't have a back-bone, if you do then just be pleasant but firm with them. Oh and need I say, whatever deal they are offering you is not actually a good deal so don't get sucked in by any of them, anywhere. The local-themed food was excellent, everything with fish was amazing. We also ate one night at the a la carte restaurant but we actually found the buffet to be better so we never used the rest of the reservation tickets. The snack bar off the pool allowed you to put together your own nacho plates (delicious!) and also provided chicken wings (disgusting!) ... like I said, stick to the mexican food and you won't be disappointed. Personally I think it is unfair of people to travel to a foreign country, stick to dishes that are common in their own country, expect those dishes to be cooked the same or better as back home, then give a bad review of the food. To the credit of the resort, they do make a valiant effort to have a wide variety of items at every meal, it's impossible not to find something you can fall in love with unless you're extremely fussy. Someone commented that the house wine was bad, I disagree. I don't even drink wine but I was in the company of two very educated wine drinkers. They both quite enjoyed the house wines and also the variety, a different wine every night. The coffee is gross but that's nothing unique to this resort, coffee is a home-based staple not a mexican-based staple, most resorts don't even provide a coffee maker. There is a Starbucks on 5th Ave. if you are in need of a \"real\" coffee, personally I think there is a fortune to be made by some smart cookie opening up a Tim Horton's right on the strip. Being firmly addicted to Timmy's and having learned from our previous trip to Cancun, I purchased a little single-cup plastic filter at Walmart for $7 and took it with us, along with a small can of coffee, a plastic mug and took my own kettle to boil water. It was perfect, had coffee every morning while enjoying the sunrise on our patio. The resort was also quite accommodating with us \"stealing\" hoards of creamers to keep in our fridge. The beds are not very comfortable but are typical for mexico. The bedding was clean. The room was nice and clean and was expertly taken care of daily even when we didn't leave something extra for them. In fact we did not have any change for a couple of days in a row so on the third day we left them a tripple tip, when we came back to the room the cash was still there but moved, clearly they were not sure it was a tip so they just left it, very impressive. After that we made a point of leaving the tip on the pillows. Also impressive was how well the room was cleaned of bugs. There are little bugs that will invade your room if you are silly enough to leave the bug screen open on your patio, which I did. This is NOT a reflection of the cleanliness of the resort, you must expect there are bugs when you are staying in a sunny destination. By the time we left the room the next morning they were everywhere but we had an excursion to go to and just left. When we returned that evening the room was once again spotless, not a bug to be seen, and not even a lecture about closing the screen. I have no idea what they had to do to get them all out but they did an amazing job, and I learned to keep the screen closed. The staff, we didn't have one single person that was not excellent. Particularly enjoyable were the pool entertainment staff who went out of their way to ensure a good time. The resort itself is very much mexican, so if you are wanting to stay in something with a Kardashian-approved look/feel to it then this is not the place for you. The colors are vibrant and the vibe is definitely mexican all the way, we actually preferred the authenticity of it over the more upscale resorts. Someone else said that there is smoking everywhere, that was not true. There is no smoking anywhere in the lobby of the resort or anywhere else indoors including the restaurants. There were a couple of times we saw people light up in the lobby and they were quickly asked to smoke outside. Drives me crazy when anti-smokers make grand statements like that. Travelling with 3 non-smokers and 1 smoker, we all found that it was very well accommodated for everyone. The resort is small so you don't have far to walk to get to anything, which is great if you are spending the day on the beach and want something from your room it's no big deal to go back and get it. Our room was on the second floor at the lobby end so we never had an issue with being disturbed by the noise from the disco, which is at the beach-end. There was only one night where the noise kept us awake but that was the Mexican halloween which is a huge celebration time and was not a big deal. If you are really uptight about getting your rest, take some ear plugs with you and use them. Shopping. The famous 5th avenue strip is just minutes up the road and quite easy to walk to but you will pay at least 3x more for everything compared to if you just go about 5 blocks further north and shop at the local stores. Also the taxi's, if you take a taxi right from the entrance of the resort then you will also pay at least 3x more than if you just walk a couple of blocks up the road and wave one down. A trick that the pool girl taught us was to ask the price in spanish, if you ask in English then the price doubles ... learning a few simple spanish words and phrases surrounding bartering, manners, and costs can end up saving you a significant amount of $$ (they will teach you this right by the pool at the resort upon request). When half our party shopped at the same store separately, the ones that used English paid over 3x more for the same item as the others paid who bartered in spanish. Regardless, if you are not prepared to barter then you should not be shopping. I was very frustrated when the ones that paid more for stuff called the locals \"con artists\" and thieves. Not fair. Everybody knows that you must barter in Mexico, and if you haven't educated yourself at least to that point before you go then you should not be going. Whatever the price that is being asked initially, drop it by 50% and that is what you should end up paying, only go as high as 60% if it's something you reeeaaallly want that is unique, but definitely no higher. That is what the mexicans expect you to do. If you are paying more then you are not bartering properly, and that does not make the locals \"con artists\" they are simply trying to feed their families on incredibly low wages. If you went to the local stores you would see that they pay the same costs for things as we do in Canada, and yet their DAILY wage averages $7. If you want the locals to like you and treat you well then it's actually not about the tips (although those are obviously appreciated given the poverty). They love it when you try, and fail, to speak their language beyond the standard \"Ola\" (properly pronounced Hola btw). We got the pool staff to teach us all our basic manners as well as little phrases to make fun of ourselves such as \"stupid canadian tourists\" which brought much laughter. Seriously if you just learn to tell them to have a good day in their own language along with basic manners, you'd be amazed at how far that will go for making your stay something special. The beach. Amazing. Speaking to travel agents this resort has one of the best private beaches along the east coast. The only disappointment was all the boats docked off the shore obstructing the view. There were plenty of chairs, good security and the sand was completely rock-free. Ocean. Not too far out there is a natural reef you can easily swim to. If you are a snorkel snob you will enjoy the huge variety of beautiful sea life to be easily spotted. When standing on the beach facing the ocean, the right side definitely has more to see than the left. A strong recommendation would be that you take some sort of brightly colored buoy with you and attach it off yourself. There is a lot of boat traffic and it is hard to enjoy snorkelling when you are constantly worried about being mowed over by a boat or jet ski because they don't see your little snorkel spout sticking out of the water. Alcohol. The drinks were great, not watered-down at all. The only disappointment was the swim up pool bar. When you sit at it from the pool side you are facing the back of everything at a much lower level so your view is of mechanical workings of the fridges and stuff. No big deal you can always get out of the pool and go to the ground-level side where there are plenty of tables and chairs. In summary, for those looking for an authentic mexican experience I can't see how you cannot find this resort to meet and exceed your expectations in every area, and the price is awesome too! If you are more comfortable with your regular creature comforts of home, then go to Cancun, you'll hardly know you're even in a foreign country.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wi", "Title": "\u201cAwesome resort for the money\u201d", "Author": "tristo", "ReviewID": "UR122318689", "Content": "We stayed at Grand CoCo Bay over the holidays and loved it.

One day we got bikes from the entertainment staff and rode bikes to Playa Del Carmen. If you enjoy spending time in Playa this place is great, it's close enough to save a lot of money on cab fair but still far enough to not feel like you're in the city.

We also enjoyed the paint your own pottery stand. Also for anyone looking for an inexpensive massage, just a short walk down the beach toward Playa there is a tent right on the beach that does an awesome 50 minute massage of your choice for $20.

On paper this resort offers ocean front and ocean view rooms; An international buffet, snack bar, coffee snack bar, Mexican and Italian restaurants; Evening shows (including dinner on some nights); a disco; a gift shop; in hotel Travel reps; front desk service; room service; phone service; Tennis courts, a Spa; Jewelry shop; beach front; pools; garden; elevators; and hot tubs. It is also located about 5 blocks (less than 1km from the 5th Av shopping district). Although the hotel offers all of the afore mentioned services, they are not of good quality and most certainly are not in par with 4.5 stars. I would rate the overall quality of this hotel at 3 stars, but, considering the variety of services I would bump up the rating to 3.5 stars and no more. If you are planning a trip to this hotel please understand this as we felt like we were sold a better product than was provided. The Grand Coco Bay Resort is quite older and a bit run down, the rooms do have air conditioning, a flat screen TV, hair dryer, iron, coffee machine, safe (for a $7 check in fee) and a balcony. The TV has about 30 channels; most Spanish, but English channels include HBO and National Geographic. Don't expect to receive a TV report control as there are none. There is a mini-fridge that was stocked with cans of coke, diet coke, sprite and sol beer. The mattresses are on the harder side and you get four feather pillows. Personally, I had trouble sleeping on my bed but other people in my party had no complaints. There are bed side reading lamps but they are tied to a motion sensor so if you're prone to read in bed you may have to wave at the sensor every 10 minutes or so. All areas of this hotel are smoking so do keep that in mind when booking. The bathrooms are just okay. There are tubs with shower heads but they have permanent non-slip grips so taking a bath is just not comfortable. We also noticed very small bugs in the bathroom around the sink area that ended up in some of our toiletry bags. We opted for an ocean view room and unfortunately the way that the hotel is laid out the only rooms with an ocean view are the furthest away from the ocean. If you like a quiet room do not choose an ocean view room unless it's on the 3rd floor as they are located directly above the main lobby and theatre. There are a handful of ocean front rooms, half of which are directly next to the disco the other half are directly next to the children\u2019s playground. The food was just okay - Breakfast is the best meal and contains the best variety including pancakes, eggs, omelets, muffins, donuts, pastries, yogurt, cereal, sausage, fruit and rice and beans. Lunch and supper are hit and miss. The salad bar wasn't very good - most days it contained frozen peas, shredded cabbage, boiled eggs, capers, olives and picked beats. The fruit was quite amazing and it ate quite a bit of it. The meats were almost always overcooked. There were always Mexican buffet items as well as some form of rice, potato, and mushy pasta dish. There were soups as well as buns offered with every meal. Dessert was good only sometimes. My favourite meal during this trip was fajitas made fresh by the chef. There is a pool side snack bar that makes fresh tortilla chips, salsa, guacamole, ok chilli and watery nacho cheese sauce. (it was pretty good for the pool side). They also made wings, fries (which 30% of the time were cold), cheese burgers, hot dogs, chicken and mini-pizzas (The pizza was really quite nice). The menu lists fish, Portobello mushroom and veggie burgers but they are not stocked and therefore not offered. They also have ice cream at the snack bar. Onions, greens and tomato slices are put on the burgers about 3/4 of the time. There is also a pastry/coffee and tea table in the lobby next to the pay computer (it is set up at about 6-7pm). The coffee, to be honest, really sucks. The tea and the pastries are very nice though. WiFi is available at a fee as well as use of the hotel computers. The lobby bar does have an espresso machine but the bar tenders don't like using it so unless you insist on it they will point you toward the coffee carafe. The Italian restaurant is a small step up from the buffet (food wise) but the atmosphere is quite nice. The house wine, to be honest, is quite gross and better bottles are offered at a fee. The tomato soup was good but over seasoned - the salad bar was confusing but better than the buffet. Our entr\u00e9es were overcooked but better than the buffet... if you get what I mean. We never made it to the Mexican restaurant. The beach is small - about 20 feet wide. There is only room for a few palapas, chairs and a volleyball court. The ocean is calm and swimmable - however - at any given time there are between 60 to 80 local fisherman boats anchored about 40 feet off of shore directly in front of the hotel but not on the adjacent beaches (for what ever reason). As a result the swim area is greatly decreased and swimmers run the risk of swimming in boat oils and even being hit by a vessel (I saw two near misses). The pools are alight but on occasion sea birds bathe and drink out of them. I went to the Ya'Ax Spa twice and has 1 truly amazing massage by the shorter masseuse (sorry but I can't remember her name). The facilities are once again hyped up to be better than they are. On paper they list men\u2019s and women\u2019s locker rooms, showers, saunas, robes, a sensory floor, tea, relaxing music etc... In actuality, there are separate locker rooms with saunas but on my second spa booking I was put into the men\u2019s locker room (I am a women). I found this quite awkward as a couple of men arrived and began changing in front of me. The only place to change was the shower stall and it was full of water. The music was, again, ok and the tea was just nice. The 'sensory floor' is just foam with a plastic hardwood look. The facial (which was complementary) was applied by the masseuse during my massage appnt. and I would rate at a 6 out of 10. The massage was amazing (10 out of 10) and I would book again (but only with the good masseuse - she combined, Swedish, lomi lomi and traditional techniques). Services can be charged to your room but they insist that you pay after you leave so bring $$. Overall, I was unnerved by the spa facilities but had a great massage... The evening shows were excellent!!! On a few occasions the buffet was closed and served in the auditorium about 2 hours before the show. Twice during our stay the hotel had a 'casino night' at the disco - it was family friendly and just okay. The disco is located directly next to the beach and is on the smaller side - It contains a dart board and a pool table. The poolside entertainment was fun enough, we learned how to salsa, played bingo and volleyball. The hotel staff were some-what unaccommodating. Most staff only spoke Spanish (fair enough) and we did try our best to ask for things in Spanish. About a third of the hotel guests were from Mexico with another quarter from Europe with the rest from Canada and the US but I found that staff were noticeably nicer and more accommodating to the Mexican guests. At some meals the wait staff didn't offer us drinks. Even as we tried to gain their attention they served other Spanish speaking tables and continued to ignore us. Some staff members were quite nice and very hardworking though. (I should note that our group was nothing but respectful during our visit.) When we arrived at the hotel no concierge service was setup and we were very confused as to what to do and where to go. We found our way to the front desk, checked in and luckily had a staff member show us to our rooms. I observed other guests, having just arrived to Grand Coco Bay having the general direction of their rooms pointed out to them. All in all, our first impression of this hotel was pretty bad - We had a very heated conversation about changing hotels but decided to give it a chance. After seven days we can confidently say that we will never stay here again. We all felt quite duped with the star rating of this hotel but all in all eventually found relaxation around the pool and on the beach. (But most hotels have beaches and hotels - some of which are actually 4.5 stars).", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat time!\u201d", "Author": "Jenna H", "ReviewID": "UR121749849", "Content": "Just got back from grand coco bay and had a great time there.

We were the last off 5 drop offs before ours so we have now been on the bus almost an 1 and a half hours finally checked in check in just after 1am We were suppossed to be here by 8pm. We are offered a room that turns out to be just a few feet away from a disco bar directly beside our room, this is not a bar from this resort this is an all out private club built directly beside Grand Coco Bay literally a few feet from the rooms and runs all alongside the one side of the resort the music is so loud you can here it vibrating all the way to the other side of the resort. Turns out the bar can be rented out and there was a huge wedding party booked til 6am and then at 8am the pounding music started on the other side of the room at the pool so needless to say we went for literally 24 hrs with no sleep. The next nite it was booked out for something else otherwise it closes generally at 2. We had them move us to one of the back rooms that was much quiter and had an ovienview however on the 3rd nite the ceiling in the bathroom started leaking really bad and we called maintennence at 3:30 in the morning to come fix it. The following day was our anniversary we just came back from shopping on 5th Avenue to get ready for our booked 5 year anniversary dinner when we were casually asked by the staff if my husband was a, doctor not understanding why he asked that, we came around the corner and noticed a woman lying on the floor in distress it was clear to us this woman was deceased the staff had absolutely no idea what they were doing when it came to CPR or anything else they had no equipment it took forever for an ambulance to come but it was already to late. found out later the woman was ill she thought it was indigestion on the plane and refused to take the ambulance waiting for her at the plane to the hospital. She literally just checked in and collapsed in front of the elevator going to the room. She passed away from a heart attack. Very somber and upsetting by this point my husband and I cancelled our anniversary dinner went the next night we never knew who these people were or anything about them.The staff were very helpful friendly outgoing and always quick with responding to service, however they would only restock beverages in the room refrigerator 3 days. We went Mexican nite for our anniversary and was very disappointed basicsally it was the same food they would serve at the buffet there was no variety the same thing every day. The dinner theatres were combined with the entertainment which we didnt like dinner started at 6:30 but the entertainment didnt start until 8:30 so you would have to sit around or come back and get a seat with no view. All in all we would choose somewhere else next time.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "kamloops,B.C.", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant Resort\u201d", "Author": "clubmed63", "ReviewID": "UR121334407", "Content": "My wife and I spent one week at this resort, Nov.19th to Nov.26th. We arrived by shuttle from the Cancun Airport and were greeted by friendly courteous desk staff with glasses of champagne and cool damp towels. Check in was fast and efficient with a quick orientation. The bell person took our suitcase and we were off to our room. Upon entering the room, he noticed that the sliding mirrored closet door frame was broken and could not slide smoothly in its' track. We went for a walk around the grounds and upon returning to our room, there was a maintenance man, removing and replacing the lower track. Now, that's service!!! I telephoned the week previously asking for a ground floor room with a king bed and was told that they would try to accommodate us which they did. The room was quite acceptable and comfortable. The king bed was firm which I prefer. The flat screen T.V. had no remote control and the desk informed me that they did not have a spare for that brand but next day there was a remote available at the desk, problem solved. We enjoyed the whole atmosphere of the resort, including the bars, snack bar the buffet and the A la Carte dinners. A special hello to Carlos on the pool bar And Neltre in the buffet. All the staff were always friendly and courteous toward us....perhaps it is because, both my wife and I treat people with respect and warmth. Another thing, we always try to tip the staff for good service. They don't make great wages and small tips of 20 pesos are greatly appreciated. I watched the buffet staff work at a very fast and continual pace almost at the point of running and we were always served quickly. I had the Grouper fish in both the A la Carte restaurants and my wife had salmon in the Italian and the Grouper in the Mexican restaurants and they were soooo good. 5th Avenue was interesting although a typical tourist trap. If you want to purchase silver jewelry beware that there are a lot of rip offs. One merchant approached us like a long lost buddy telling us that he works at the Grand Coco Bay Resort, (of course, he spotted our wrist band which identified us) and proceeded to escort us into \" his mother's \" shop and after weighing some silver ear rings my wife liked, offering them for a \" bargain \" price of $70 U.S. By the time we hit the door, they were available for half that price. We did not buy. We took a tour to the Coba Ruinas which was really the high lite of our vacation. It's the only spot where you can still climb the pyramid. all the other locations are banned to climbing and are roped off. We were told that come January this location will also be banned from climbing. Now, do I have any complaints about Grand CoCo Bay Resort? Yes, and this comment is directly pointed at the management....I know that you read these submissions by your responses, so I would like to ask you why you have an exchange rate of 9 Pesos to the Canadian Dollar when the going rate at the bank or money changers on 5th avenue are12? You don't have such a large discrepancy for the U.S. Dollar and the two Dollars are almost at par. I complained to two supervisors about this but they responded simply that the exchange rate is set by the \" administration\". Paying 25% on the exchange is outrageous and I strongly suggest that you revisit this policy and adjust the rate to a reasonable number so that you don't give the appearance of gauging your Canadian guests which you are presently doing....so, to all future guests who are reading this submission, see if there have any changes been made to the exchange rate and if not, complain to the management as I have done or else you can pay the outrageous difference!!

When we booked the resort it was getting pretty decent reviews on tripadvisor, 1 week before departure I decided to check to reviews again only to find out it was receiving a lot of complaints. The trip was non-refundable so we had no choice but to stick it out and stay there - this is my review based on my experience. The hotel is classified as a 4.5 star (at least through our tour provider it was), it is actually a 2.5 star at best. The location is right on the beach which is great, but if you are worried about safety and would rather stay in a gated community I would recommend Playacar as security is at a maximum. At the Bay you can come and go as you please, no gates, no one checks in on you. The hotel itself is rundown and in need of a serious update. The rooms are nothing special and you can usually find bugs in the room. If you want to use the safe in the room there is a surcharge (our safe was broken). If you have an early morning excursion and want breakfast delivered to the room there is a surcharge. No booze in the room, just 6 cans of pop and 2 bottles of water that are never replenished. This hotel needs to look up what the definition of all inclusive is. I don't think the concierge understands what her role should be, as instead of making sure guest are happy and having a good time she rather sell you on \"special promotions\" meaning a sales pitch on how you can book directly to stay at Coco Bay next time instead of using a tour provider. (For the record I wouldn't stay at Coco Bay again if THEY paid me). My boyfriend and I declined her presentation, but that didn't stop her from asking us another 3 times during our stay. She also advised that we book all excursions through her and not our tour provider as she could get us a \"better deal\". FYI if you are traveling with a tour provider you are backed through TICO or your companies insurance - if you book through the hotel or independent and have a problem you have no recourse; so consider that when making your bookings. We booked everything through our Sunwing rep. The food is crap - period. You won't starve because they have a pool bar which is half decent (the man working the poolbar is also the hardest working employee at the resort and he is always by himself preparing multiple orders as the buffet is sub-par at best). There are 2 restaurants on the resort, Italian and Mexician. The Italian was tolerable and Mexician was DISGUSTING! My meal consisted of a \"salad\" which was 1 lettuce leaf with 5 hard pieces of coconut, a cherry tomato cut in half and a ball of grey, yes grey goat cheese. Main was coconut shrimp that were also grey in colour and smelled about a fishy as you could image. The rice was also hard. My boyfriend has the same fish they served at lunch that day. Needless to say we ate dinner off the resort every night. The servers in the buffet need work. I have never been to an all inclusive before where I had to serve myself. At breakfast no one came to ask if I wanted a coffee, at lunch no water or drinks offered. In fact one day during lunch after being in the sun all morning, I helped myself to the water jug after being ignored for 25 minutes only to get yelled at by a staff member that \"she was going to serve me\". Also a lot of locals stay at this resort, so they all received service while we were ignored. The maids either come at 8am or 4pm, didn't seem to be a method, if we left bright an early for an excursion we would return in the late afternoon only to see our room hadn't been touched. Didn't matter if you tipped or not, didn't get you any better service. Bottom line is, I would never stay here again. If you choose to stay here do so at your own risk, but don't expect any form of luxury. Its super basic and without the service that one would expect from an all inclusive. Your vacation dollars are much better off spent elsewhere.", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ribe, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cCoco Bay November 2011\u201d", "Author": "Lars D", "ReviewID": "UR120677766", "Content": "We would like to thank all staff for 2 wonderful weeks at Grand Coco Bay Resort.

We never travel in November being off-season, hurricanes, etc. but were pleasantly surprised that the weather was awesome and every day we had our choice of a beach or pool chair without having to go down at 7AM and reserve it with a towel! Same for the a la carte restaurants, no line ups to reserve. The hotel is outdated, were a bit worried when we entered the lobby, not very bright and inviting but were greeted with champagne and smiling faces. Many beach chairs could be replaced and all the towels were very old and tattered. Other than that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, had a great time and will go back. No complaints whatsoever about the food, the buffet and snack bar always had great choices. The Italian and Mexican restaurants were really good too, although we were disappointed with the mexican decor in the Mexican, thought it should be more colourful & lively - more \"mexican\" style and fun, but found it to be very serious. The staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout the resort. They serve the red wine chilled which I prefer room temp. All I needed to do was ask and voila, a whole bottle for me! (although Mexican wine is not the greatest). And yes as others pointed out, there were teeny ants in the bathroom but nowhere else. We did leave a muffin on the dresser only to find it covered with ants so just don't leave any food lying around. The beds were hard but we slept great, no problem there. The resort and our room was always clean, the staff was continuously picking up the dirty dishes and cups, the poor seagals didn't even get a chance at leftovers! The grounds were beautiful with plants and flowers and very well looked after. We were surprised the pool bar shut down so early, at dinner time when the buffet opened. But the buffet had a bar as well and I guess they want to keep everyone in the lobby bar in the evening so the pool area is quiet for those who want R&R. We had really hoped to hear mexican and carribean music, that's why we go to Mexico - but none. The lobby bar music could have been better as well. At least we got some in town with the mariacchi bands and some rock in the sports bars. The beach was gorgious, we walked forever - and no vendors! As you walked to the right, a few resorts down the way, there was a bad sewage smell just in that area. Didn't smell it at all where we were. The bathroom by the pool had that smell too, was pretty bad at times but after the floors were cleaned, it was gone, must come from the drains. Our ultimate highlight of the trip was being walking distance to 5th Avenue and we went often, both day and night - very safe! Found a great pizza & pasta place, Barillo's I think, and of course a few mexican cuisines, followed by several cervesas! We're not one's to stay secluded on a resort. We did end up doing the timeshare thing at the Royal and got $80US (in pesos). Although persistent, they were very nice to us but not the case with another couple from our resort.

One of the days, I had some fish for lunch from the buffet and immediately felt sick... I don't recommend eating the fish. I only had one drink out of the entire time I was there, it tasted kind of cheap, but it wasn't bad, and I had it with the Italian dinner, which was really good. The rooms were cozy, but unless you are 100% fluent in Spanish, forget about watching TV. I fortunately know Spanish, but my Aunt does not, so I had to translate for her every few seconds. You might want to get some more English channels, in respect to your English-speaking customers, because there are a lot of them. The beds were as hard as rocks, and there were ants in the beds. The shows were mediocre, they reminded me of the shows I used to be in when I was in middle school. Cute, but nothing too impressive. 99% of the staff was very friendly; the staff in the Spa were the nicest. The timeshare people are friendly, don't get me wrong, but they need to understand that no means NO and take that as a sign that them pestering us is not a good way to get us to participate in that timeshare crap. I got hit on a lot by the male staff. One of them was trying to push me to go out clubbing. I understand Spanish, and clearly they thought I didn't, and I heard some young men (who worked there) make a comment about my behind. I don't usually take that stuff seriously, but there were times where I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable. I am well \"of age\" to go into the hot tub, so this isn't from a personal \"frustration\", but I think the \"over 18\" rule to go into the hot tub is a little bit ridiculous. All in all, my stay at the Grand Coco Bay was alright. It wasn't terrible at all, but it wasn't SPECTACULAR.

Stayed at Mayakoba last year, Iberostar a few years back and Riu Yucatan before that. Loved GCB. You were treated very well by all the staff. We loved the omellettes made to order, fresh donuts every morning, with different pastries every day. All the usual cereals, yogurts, fresh fruits, fresh squeezed orange juice (other juices I didn't sample).Standard for the all-inclusive. There was even champagne for mimosas and vodka and tomatoe juice for those who start the party early. The restaurants were limited, only Mexican and Italian. We were there for 7 days. We were told at check in that we could come back for more tickets for dinner reservations(got one for both Mexican and Italian), if we'd like. So we went back and went to the Italian twice. The restaurant food was great and the service was very professional and the presentation was lovely. The wine was very good there too. My husband loved the cervesa, he said he saw them clean the tap. We stayed at a Riu in Cabo and the beer was foul tasting and that has happened at other resorts too. The room was attractive and spotless, the tile floors were cleaned with bleach every day. We had a flat screen TV, Air conditioning blew cold, I left a couple of dollars on the dresser for the maid every day, she didn't take it. Finally, I just caught her and handed it to her. We paid 3 dollars for the safe, I like to keep the passports, etc. in there. I saw people complain about the towels. You got the card for the towels and you could exchange your towels as many times as you would like every day. The beds were firm, the pillows were soft and plentiful (4 on each bed), I packed my own pillow because of reviews I read, not necessary. We were in an ocean view room on the first floor. Which would have been a spectacular view if we were on the 2nd floor, but we didn't pay any extra and we were about 50 to 75 feet from the ocean, and the pool was right outside of our door. It was a lovely pool. The entertainment at the pool was continuous. Evening entertainment was great too. Location was only about 1/2 mile walk to 5th Ave. Beach was soft and sandy.

If that's what you want, go elsewhere and pay the much higher rates. For what you pay, Grand Coco Bay offers a good value. My fiance and I were at Grand Coco Bay from 10/16/11 through 10/21/11 and had a very enjoyable time. Admittedly, I walked into the Lobby with mixed expectations based on the reviews I had read. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. REGISTRATION: Fast, efficient and friendly. We didn't have to wait more then 5 minutes to get checked in. We were welcomed with a chilled glass of champagne - refilled with a smile. The desk clerk explained the resort, where things were, etc. and was glad to answer questions. We were offered use of the safe for $3.00 per day. We declined but once we got to the room, I guess we could have used it anyway but we didn't try. The bellman delievered our luggage to our room very quickly and confirmed that we knew where things were around the resort. LOBBY: For a change, we weren't accosted by people trying to get us to tour a timeshare. I know others who weren't quite as fortunate. Beware - the concierge will try to hook you into sitting down to book tours (non-timeshare) and to sell reduced price Costco cards, etc. We easily avoided this. Just smiled and said no thanks. After that we were left alone. NOTE: The Lobby is NOT air conditioned - that may bother some, especially during the really hot/humid months. Wasn't too bad while we were there. We REALLY enjoyed the Lobby Bar and the bartender there. If you want your drink stronger, simply ask - he was glad to accommodate. ROOM: We had a garden view right off the pool. I don't know that I'd pay more for an ocean view as many these rooms offered a very limited view and depending on where the room is, you might be disappointed. Ocean front might be worth the extra charge if that's important to you. The bed was quite comfortable (a bit firm but that's what we prefer - certainly not as hard as some Mexico resorts where the bed is like a concrete slab) . The pillows were fine if a little lumpy (but that means they've been washed so I'm OK with that!). The AC kept the room very comfortable as did the ceiling fan. We called maintenace about a minor issue - they were at our door within 15 minutes and were pleasant about fixing the problem. The room was clean. Could have used a fresh coat of paint, but it wasn't really that bad. I did see several rooms being painted while we were there so perhaps they just had not gotten to our room yet. We were there at the end of Peak Season so guessing they do a lot of sprucing up during off-season as you would expect. MINI-BAR: Don't expect much here - 4 canned sodas and a bottle of water. I read another review that said there was an additional charge for additional bottles of water but when I asked the person refilling the minibars, he happily gave me extras. BATHROOM: Spacious and clean. Well lit. No complaints except that there isn't an AC vent so it did get a bit stuffy. Toilertries were what I expected for the rate paid. Nothing to brag about (small bar soap, body lotion and combo shampoo/shower gel). This didn't bother us as we travel with our own toiletries anyway. Towels weren't luxurious but again, they were what one should anticipate for the rate paid. When we asked the housekeeper in the walkway for an extra towel, she didn't hesitate to give us a couple. BALCONEY: OK, so they could use some better chairs here. The ones on our balconey were the basic plastic ones you see everywhere. I did notice some balconey's had wood/fabric chairs that appeared nicer. The chairs were a bit grungy and could have used a good wipe down. NOTE: Ground floor rooms had hammocks - nice touch and wish we had had one. BUFFET RESTAURANT: OK, again, you get what you pay for. You're not paying for 5-star gourmet meals so don't expect them. The food was average overall. Nothing spectacular but there were always things that we enjoyed. Breakfast was usually particularly good - except for the \"weird\" bacon. Particularly enjoyed the French Toast sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. We did not try the Mexican or Italian reservation-required restaurants - not for any particular reason, just didn't. NOTE: The buffet restaurant is NOT air conditioned. It was a bit uncomforable for a couple of meals, but not unbearable. Never experienced a wait to get our table or our food. A little slow with coffee a couple of times, but no worse than our local IHOP. \"SPECIAL\" MEALS: Two of the nights we were there, they served the buffet dinner in the theatre off of the Lobby instead of in the normal buffet restaurant. One night they had a Mexican show (we didn't stay long for that, opting to enjoy the quiet by the pool instead) with Mexican food. The other night offered an International buffett with a cute broadway show. The entertainers were friendly and enthusiastic. POOL and GROUNDS: There were contantly people working to keep the pool and the grounds clean. The bottom of the pool felt a bit slippery/slimey but I attribute that to lots of people jumping in with suntan lotion/oil. There was some sand at the bottom of the pool too. Gee, what a surprise - it's only a few yards from the BEACH! No one could keep up with the sand 100% of the time. The lounge chairs were a bit faded and worn on the edges - but hey, they are out in a sunny, salt-water environment 24/7/365, what do you expect? They weren't dirty, just a bit faded. We never had a problem finding chairs, but again, we were there during off-season. I think the well kept grounds would benefit from having many more bright flowering plants to give it more color and life. Pool bar - I recommend asking for extra flavored alcohol if you're getting a frozen drink and ask them to blend it really well or you'll have a watery frozen drink with lots of small chunks of ice. SPA: Beware of changes in prices. The rate sheet in our room had a rate of $80 for the massage I wanted. When checking out of the spa after the massage, they tried to charge $96. Had a little \"discussion\" with the person at the desk about it but he did eventually change the price. Another complaint is that the young man that checked me in didn't communicate well about what was to happen, where I should go, etc. so I was left a bit confused. Also, if you're at all a \"voluptuous\" type you'll find that the robes are small - and they don't have larger ones - I hate that! They could use new massage tables. Though covered with a pad and a sheet, when the covers shifted you could see the old vinyl had been taped over several times. The shower on the ladies side of the spa wasn't as clean as I would have liked. The massage itself was very relaxing and well done, though I probably wouldn't use this spa again and would go to 5th Ave instead. SNACK BAR: Pretty good overall. Always had chips, seasoned taco meat, and melted chese for self-serve nachos. Pico de gallo was fresh and tasty. Guacamole was OK - not great. But we're from Texas where we have lots of great guacamole so our standards for that are pretty high :) Fiance enjoyed the French Fries and hot dogs. I liked the tuna sandwich with mayo and pico de gallo added. There was never a wait to order or get our fooed. Special note to Megan - we enjoyed the cat being around. We noticed that a trap was set and the cat was successfully caught our last night there. Hopefully they moved him to a more permaenent home...... BEACH: There are lots of small boats tied up just beyond the large roped off swim area. This is due to a breakwater that protects the boats from waves. If you want an unobstructed view of the ocean, don't stay here. It didn't bother us. The lounge chairs on the beach were in similar condition to those by the pool. We thought they were fine. They were in the process of putting new covers and pads on the \"beach beds\" so we didn't use those. We didn't spend as much time at the beach as we did at the pool so I can't comment on the strolling beach vendors. It's a rather small beach area but perfectly adequate. We did notice a rather unpleasant sewage type of odor along the beach (not limited to the Grand Coco Bay beach, but all the way to the cruise ship docks, which is as far as we walked). Not sure if it was caused because of the recent heavy rains or if it's always an issue in this part of Playa Del Carmen. DISCO/SPORTS BAR: Didn't check out either of them though heard comments from others that they were pretty boring. Again, it was off-season so that's not unexpected. BARS OVERALL: I can't say whether or not the alcohol was watered down. I typically drink frozen drinks and asked for extra of whatever flavor I was having (banana liquor, coffee liquor, strawberry, etc.). My fiance drank beer or vodka martini's and wasn't disappointed. He was fine with the beer they had on tap. Not many truly top shelf alcohol was available, but again, 3-star vs. 5-star. If you simply MUST have your favorite vodka, bourbon, etc. buy it at the airport and take it to the bar so the bartender can fix your drinks with it while you're sitting there. Yes, a bit of a hassle but if you won't be happy otherwise, it's a way to get around the limited choices they offer. MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS: You're staying in a tropical climate so some insects are to be expected - whether you are staying in a 3-star or a 5-star resort. It's just one of the things to expect. We saw a few very small ants in our bathroom but nothing more. We really wished for more Caribbean or Mexican music out by the pool. I think the music they played detracted from the overall Caribbean vacation experience. Shopping on 5th Ave - Suggestion - take a cab ($5) to the FAR end of where the shopping starts then leisurely stroll back to the hotel. It can be difficult to make the cab driver understand where you want to go. I suggest telling the doorman what you want to do and ask him to tell the cab driver if you're not confident the driver understands. The vendors along 5th can be annoying trying to get you to come see there wares but that is how it's done and is to be expected. Just smile and keep going. A trick they will use is to recognize the braclet you are wearing is for a particular resort and tell you \"Hey, I'm Felipe, you're waiter from XYZ Resort. Come see the jewelry my mom makes. I'm working for her today - my day off.\" Whatever! Don't be afraid to haggle over the prices. I bought a ring for $65 that started out at $160. There are several cafes along the street should you want to enjoy a meal away from the resort. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised after reading some of the comments. A lot of that has to do with both having a good attitude and having realistic expectations. If you expect a 3-star experience, you won't be disappointed. If you expect a 5-star experience, I hope you will go elsewhere instead of staying at Grand Coco Bay and then writing negative comments about issues that are outside of a 3-star expectation.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois City, Illinois", "Title": "\u201c\"I wouldn't recommend Coco Bay\"\u201d", "Author": "prtynpnk1116", "ReviewID": "UR119733901", "Content": "My boyfriend and I went to Grand Coco Bay with another couple. We arrived Oct. 16th and stayed until Oct 23rd 2011 We are from the US. I didn't have the experience that I was expecting to have. We reserved two rooms with king size beds with ocean view. they gave us twin beds with no ocean view. I complained, after that they wanted to charge us extra for getting a king size bed. After over 20 minutes of explaining to the front desk that we reserved the ocean view with a king size bed did they finally give us our room. Our Apple agent told us the safe was included in our price. We had to pay extra for the use of the safe and 90% of the time the safe never worked. since we were there during off season we only had a choice between two restaurants, the buffet (which is open all the time) Mexican was one day then Italian was the other day. you had to make reservations for the mexican and Italian restaurant, they only gave us two cards..For the 6 days i'm not eating at the buffet. I had to ask for more cards If you didn't go in early to make reservations then they didn't have any room for us. Mexican and Italian restaurants had very good food!! the buffet wasn't that good. I felt like I was eating the same food for 8 days. I didn't want ot be on vacation eating at a buffet. The snack bar food was good! they had this cat that kepted coming by us begging for food. I was told it was the massage ladies cat. I'm allergic to cats. It made the place look trashy with a stray cat roaming around. The walls were paper thin we had neighbors that always came home at 1am. My boyfriend and I didn't get any sleep through our whole vacation. The beds were sooooo uncomfortable. By far the worse bed I had ever slepted in. They had ants everywhere in the buffet and in our room. One of the staff told me they are bad cause the rain they got the week before we were there.. I'm not a mixed drinker I only drink beer. they only had one choice of beer.

The front desk did not keep track of our original request to have two adjoining rooms. We called ahead and reserved this as well as made follow-up calls to confirm before departing for the trip. We even took down the name of the lady who we made the reservation with. When we got to the hotel, there was no one at the front desk. Finally, someone came out and we were met with an unhappy rude man. When they had no record of our adjoining rooms request in their system and when we mentioned the lady's name who took our original request, he bluntly answered, \"Well, she's not here now is she.\" We knew it was off season and the hotel was not completely booked so we refused to believe him when he said there was nothing he could do. Finally, after 20 minutes, another lady came out and after looking into the system, she was able to come up with two adjoining rooms. Seriously? The place was simple and average regarding cleanliness. I must agree with the previous reviews when they say the place was understaffed and not everyone spoke English. Even if it is off season, it should not have been this understaffed. The outdoor snack bar was manned by ONE person (cooking AND taking orders) which led to long lines. Since the buffet was only open at certain times, the snack bar was the only source of food which led to it being pretty packed. The snack bar food was OK. The buffet is the best at breakfast, mediocre for lunch and pretty crappy for dinner. The italian restaurant (which needed a reservation) was pretty delicious and I would recommend that. The beds were ok but the pillows were horrendous! They were actually physically lumpy! I slept on a pile of my clothes as my pillow! The beach area was clean and private but because there were so many private/fishing boats in the ocean it kind of took away from the view. Nevertheless the water was clear and beautiful. The pool is designed very nicely although it was somewhat dirty. You could always see some kind of film of grease on the surface of the water and the pool floors/walls/steps were very slippery/grimy which makes me feel like it's just dirty. The pool chairs do not lay completely flat so it's hard to tan laying on your stomach. Small issue but important nonetheless for tanning lovers such as myself. The drinks were watered down but the bartender and snack bar/restaurant workers were always very nice..although there were a lot of non-English speaking workers. The disco (club) was pretty small and hardly anyone was in there. There was a pool table and an area to dance, bar and music playing. I can imagine it might be better when the hotel is more crowded. Room service is horrible. We called numerous times for someone to bring 6 cups to our room and they would either transfer us, or hang up on us! Finally, after calling the 5th time, 30 min. later someone showed up with 3 cups. We were just glad we got 3 instead of none. We loved relaxing poolside but it was very annoying having outside vendors come around and bother you into booking their services/excursions. We would be approached 3-4 times a day and they won't just leave you alone when you say you're not interested. One of the poolside workers who manned the towel area begged us to play volleyball for seriously 10 minutes straight when we just wanted to walk around the beach area. I don't think it's an issue for people to ask, but a no is a no and they should understand that and realize some people are just on vacation to relax and do their own thing. I saw that they did not really bother the elderly or families. One great thing about this hotel is that it's a 10 minute walk to the town area where all the restaurants and shops are. Although there was a different guy at the front desk at our departure, he was just as rude and I was appalled at his attitude.

We traveled to Playa Del Carmen for a friend's bachlorette party. I just got back from my stay which was from September 29th - October 3rd and had to write a review, my very first one ever. In a nutshell: Reception: When we arrived at the resort we were greeted by no one and it took close to an hour to check in. The front desk staff is slow moving and slow thinking. When i complained about how slow the service was and how rude the receptionist was, he threatened me by saying, \"You better be careful while you're here\". First time in my life I was ever threatened by a hotel worker. Room: The pillows on the bed were extremely uncomfortable as were the beds. I woke up with a sore back every day, as well as my friends who were in the room next door. The maid service was good however, they cleaned daily and early. Food: Breakfast was good, lunch was worse and dinner was inedible. The snack bar, poolside was good but there was only one cook so it was slow moving. They also close room service very early in the night. The hours of the buffet are also terrible. We couldn't even eat lunch at noon. We had to wait until well after 1:00pm. The food at the italian restaurant was good however I did not try the Latin one. Pool: The pool was great, size and depth-wise but it was dirty. I literally stepped on what looked like sheet rock. The floors were incredibly slippery with grime and the pool chairs were uncomfortable and covered in bird feces. Locale: While the resort looks like it is in the underdeveloped neighborhood, a $5.00 cab ride will take you to the downtown area in under 5 minutes. This was probably the highlight of our stay there, a trip to town to enjoy the food and clubs. It is also right on the beach which was great. Staff: The bartender was nice, as was the snack bar and food service people. Everyone in reception was horrible, as were the staff over the phone. I was constantly put on hold and no one knew what they were talking about. We were constantly harassed by people selling timeshares, condos or activities. When we would politely ask them to leave they would call us rude.

I would rate the hotel as follows: - location (A+) - 5th ave is a 5 minute walk away, and the beach stretches for miles in both directions. the location of this hotel is about perfect. - clean (A+)- it was very well cleaned - our room was always cleaned well, but the area around the pool was almost spotless. There was even someone sifting sand! The only negative around the cleanliness was that no one came down to clean up plates and cups on the beach during the day. - staff (A)- the staff was generally very friendly and took the time to talk. - beach (A+) - beautiful and soft with very little shells. There is a boat mooring in front of the hotel - it had maybe 20 boats, but they weren't going in and out all day, so it wasn't a distraction from anything other than the view. - entertainment (A-) - they had your standard fare of events thru the day - beach volleyball, water aerobics, bingo, dance lessons, soccer. The entertainment staff encourages participation (but beware - they are really good at volleyball!). There is a show in the evening which was usually well done. It was a shorter show and not hi-tech, but I thought they were generally pretty good. - shower (C) - it was pretty much always lukewarm at best. The ocean was warmer (and I'm serious!). Seemed no matter what time we showered, it was cold. - food (C) - the food was truly mediocre. This is my 6th all-inclusive hotel and it had the most mediocre food. There wasn't a huge selection, although there was enough selection - it just wasn't very interesting food. We did the italian and mexican restaurants, and they were better, but we ended up eating out a couple of evenings because the food just wasn't that great. - vendors (B) - in the evenings, there was often vendors there selling their wares. They were much less intrusive than those along 5th avenue. Their prices seemed in line with what we saw on 5th ave. - bar (B) - the bars were okay, but I'm used to bartenders that know what you drink within the first day and are really friendly. These bartenders were okay but not what I would term \"fun\". In addition, it seemed that a lot of the time only one of the three bars were open. They don't make mojito's - which was a huge disappointment! As for the rest of the hotel - it is a smaller hotel, but I didn't find that to be a plus or a minus. We walked and ran the beach a lot, and this hotel has beautiful sand relative to hotels that are further south (they have more shells down there). If you are a runner - I recommend running north instead of south - a 5km run from the hotel is north to the next resort and back. There are less boat ropes to jump over heading north and the slant of the sand is not as big of an angle. The bathroom only has one plug in (NOT two), provides your basic hotel blow dryer and no conditioner (I got a small bottle on the first day, but I didn't ever get it again). I thought the room was a good size - tile floor, a hammock on the patio (which was very cool!). The beds are VERY firm! The concierge is not really a concierge - it's a sales pitch. They want you to spend 90 minutes of one morning hearing about something. We never went although we were asked to go 3 seperate times in our one week stay. One fun item was that in the morning at breakfast, they had a table of supplies to make bloody mary's, mamosa's, or to put baileys in your coffee. Nice touch! We had one incident with the hotel mai'tre de in the al a cartes. Our excursion was over an hour late getting back, making us 30 minutes late for our dinner reservation. Before running to our room and changing, we thought we would check in to see if we could still get in. One of the waiters said yes and sat us. The mai'tre de then came over and told us that my husband had to go change (he was in shorts). Then while he was gone to change, the mai'tre de came back and told me that we were very late and that we should be on time and so on. Our frustration with this was that the waiter had accepted us and let us in - only to have the mai'tre de basically tell us off twice when the waiter had already said all was good. My husband tried to talk to the mai'tre de about it and point out that fact, but he was quite rude back to us...our only point was that his staff had accepted us, so the issue was with his staff member, not us.

If you're traveling in a group of four, I'd highly recommend getting two rooms instead of sharing one. They only give you three towels per room regardless of how many people are staying in there. - The resort is very stingy on water. We only got four cans of pop and two bottles of water in our room for the entire week! The expect you to take the bottle they gave you and to keep refilling it, yuck! - Snack bar was a joke. There was only one staff member, whom always had a smile on his face, but food took forever to get. The pool bar was also too slow but the bar tender was great. - Entertainment was not the greatest. The stage area reminded me of elementary school and the entertainment was average and inconsistent. Pool activities were repetitive and the same activities were done every single day. - During the day the main lobby bar was not open. If you wanted to enjoy a drink in a cooler area, you had to go into the sun to the pool bar and bring your drink inside. - The so-called \"disco\" was very dated, small, and honestly there was nothing happening every night we went. If you're looking for entertainment, this is NOT the hotel to go to. - The front staff were extremely rude and a lot of staff members in general did not speak good english. It took the staff 8 hours to get our room ready. When we got to the hotel, we signed documents indicating we wanted our room to be moved to the area of our relatives. When checking out, Alfonso called my mother and I liars when telling him we signed for a safe but never given confirmation/information on how to use it when we got our keys 8 hours later. I have never been so DISGUSTED with customer service in my life. It seemed like a lot of other people had much trouble with the front desk staff too. Everytime we passed by, there always seemed to be some sort of drama. - Food was absolutely terrible. Same garbage every night. If you love seafood, this is NOT the resort for you. The most they served were fish and scallops, both of which were not very tasty at all. Breakfast was the best meal by far. - Sanitation wise, there were always plates and cups left around the pool because there was no designated area to put away your dirty dishes. Birds kept flying to pick off plates. Also, washrooms near the pool were so gross and a completely turn off to even use. Lastly, I noticed that the same utensils used on meats were used on vegetarian items too. Touching pork and then touching a vegetarian item is a HUGE issue to those who eat kosher and halal. After witnessing that, I just stopped ordering from the snack bar. - The pool was gorgeous and so was the beach. There were a lot of boats floating metres from the beach but it didn't bother me so much. - To get to town it's a 5 minute walk. There's a lot of things to do and explore in town. - If you're looking for adventure, the Sunwing staff was great on ensuring all the tours were booked and went well. My mother and I did parasailing, Coba ruins, and atving, all of which were money well spent. Marcus was fantastic. - We had to use the room phone ONCE to call home, and it costed us almost $60 dollars for a 5 minute call to Canada... I may as well have spent that money toward another resort that offers free Wi-Fi to keep in contact with my family. My advice is to spend the extra $100 or $200 dollars per person and go elsewhere if you're looking for a higher quality resort- there's a lot in the area that I can guarantee are around the same price point of what we paid for Grand Coco Bay. I would never categorize this resort anything above a 3 star. I've been to Mexico before and was very disappointed with the services, the quality, and the overall experience I had at this resort.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cThe 3 Star Grand Coco Bay\u201d", "Author": "LeeJer", "ReviewID": "UR118281207", "Content": "We traveled with another couple to the Grand Coco Bay in August of 2011.

The rooms were clean however we would describe them as outdated with no frills. The beach was beautiful and the ocean was quite clean. We enjoyed swimming in the pool however the loungers were old and ratty looking. The service personal were polite however there just wasn't enough of them to serve the guests - we waited in lines for drinks, food, and at the front desk. We paid $800 a person for a week - so we kept telling ourselves that you pay for what you get. The hotel supplies you with two small bottles of water and after that you needed to either buy more from the hotel ($2) or bring your empty bottles to a bar where they would refill them for you. It was hot in August thus making sure you always had water to drink in your room at night was a pain. I don't think we would return here.

The real test comes when you are stranded and need assistance. A friend and I went on a six-day vacation to Playa Del Carmen and stayed at Grand Coco Bay. We had a wonderful time, enjoyed all the beautiful amenities of the resort and found the staff to be terrific. When the time came to come home (August 27th), we discovered all flights had been cancelled due to Hurricane Irene. I figured we'd have to stay an extra day or so until the storm passed, so I went to the front desk and they were able to shuffle reservations to allow us to stay in our room. Imagine my horror when I finally reached United Airlines and was informed we couldn't get another flight until a full week later (September 3rd). Grand Coco Bay's wonderful staff did everything they could to help us and accomodate us. We were able to stay in our room, which had a wonderful view of the Caribbean and the pool for our whole extra week. The bartenders, especially Javier & Manuel, were always friendly and ready to fix whatever we requested. I don't agree with reviews that state the drinks were watered down, well they certainly didn't water ours down. The food in the main restaurant was good, but I'll admit we did go into Playa one night for a great steak dinner. The specialty restaurants were wonderful - especially the Italian one. But one person really made our unexpected, extended stay extraordinary - Guest Services Manager Guadalupe. Guadalupe went way above and beyond her job description in making us feel at home from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. In fact, before we left Grand Coco Bay, I gave Guadalupe my address and email in the States extending an invitation for her to be my guest should she travel here. I would consider it an honor to extend the same hospitality she showed us while guests in her country. Good going Grand Coco Bay!

We assumed they upgraded the property because of the significant price increase. On this last trip to Playa, we noticed a sale on the property so we booked there. Such a disappointment. The staff was friendly enough, but they were tremendously under-staffed. Very difficult to get a drink for the lack of bartenders at the pool, and the main bar was closed most of the time. The main restaurant was also understaffed, therefore it was almost impossible to get any service. As with most all-inclusives, the food quality is mediocre at best. The pool was filthy (a nasty shade of green) and we also noticed a lot of debris in the pool. I would have to say that they probably had about 1/3 to 1/2 the staff they used to have and it shows.

We are both in our late 50's, very active and are quite well travelled around the world, having stayed in many places ranging from 1 to 5 stars. Upon our arrival at the airport in Cancun, just outside the airport we were warmly greeted by our Sunwing rep and ushered onto our bus. Having read previous Trip Advisor Reviews, we avoided any reception desks in the airport and thus were not duped into listening to or going to any timeshare speeches. After several hotel drop offs, we arrived approx one hour later to our hotel. We were greeted with a glass of champagne and Zoila competently and very kindly checked us in. We asked for a first floor room...2140 to be exact...in order to avoid any loud noises that may be emanating from the lobby or sports bar later on at night. This idea was also suggested by other Trip Advisor reviewers and we are very happy to say that it was very quiet every night for sleeping. Zoila is very approachable( as are the other desk staff) and quite amenable to customer requests... room changes, use of computers, safes not working, money exchange, etc. Our room was kept very clean, actually spotless, as were all of the grounds, the pool, the beaches and even the patios off of the rooms. No evidence of any bird droppings anywhere. We tipped our maid everyday as she made towel art for our pleasure. The towels and sheets were changed everyday and sink, tub and toilets cleaned. The beds would be considered to be a little on the hard side...but not really all that bad. We got used to it. There were actually three tiny pillows...an extra one in the closet, and we were able to make do. We actually ended up feeling quite comfortable. You do not need to bring a hairdryer or converter if you are from the US or Canada. We did bring extra beach towels which we knew that we were going to leave behind. Such a good idea! The location is excellent ...10 min walk to 5th Ave. You might want to spend 500 pesos to take a cab right to the end of this street to Senor Frog's ( a really fun bar I might add!) and then browse the shops and restaurants on the beach all the way back. Such an enjoyable experience. We went during the day the first time to avoid crowds; even though it was hot, there was not as must pressure for you to buy anything from anyone. Night time is lots of fun too...especially if you want to go to the many wonderful restaurants ..Origines, Luna Maya. These ones are particularly close to this resort and are very highly recommended. Fantastic service for good prices! Might also want to ask the hotel reception for restaurant reccommendations all along 5th Ave as they will give you free business cards which will entitle you to free drinks and discounts. Really loved that! Gabriel, our Sunwing rep, was caring, sensitive, good humoured and quite honest. He takes the time to get to know your likes and dislikes. I strongly reccommend you book your excursions with him and reccommend Coba, Tulum, Xel-ha, Isla Mujeres, and of course Chichenitza. Visits to cenotes are included as are terrifc lunches and snorkeling. Because of the price of this all inclusive resort you can actually afford to do as many day trips as you like! So much fun! The food in the main building at this resort is rather mediocre at best; however, there definitely is something for everyone. Snack bar was also quite good. Yummy chili cheese nachos and wings! Breakfast in my opinion is the best meal...the omellettes are incredible as the fruit. Also the Mexican a la carte restaurant is fabulous. They even let us go twice and they certainly did not have to! Gotta love that. The beach is rather small but is adequate for swimming. I actually preferred the pool. The fishing boats seemed to be a little closer than I thought they would be. At night time though, they do look quite lovely. You do want to bring bug spray to use at night if you want to drink in the lobby...although I cannot really say that I sa all that many insects. Think I got only one bite and was glad I had an anti itch medication. You should also pack some imodium as well...I did need it the first night as I my system had to adjust to this environment. I was fine the rest of the week though. My husband had absolutely no problems though. Mexican night (Monday nights) is lots of fun..might want to buy some souvenirs at this time as they are a bit cheaper. I quite liked the regular margaritas on the rocks and did not feel that they were watered down. It does help if you tip the staff! Al in all, a very nice, older small resort ...great service, well situated, friendly and helpful people who will go out of their way to make you feel at home.

The Hotel does look a bit sketchy compared to the new condo developments as you drive in through the town. The pictures you see of the hotel must have been taken a long time ago because there is condo development all around the hotel so you see a lot of construction. Not the pristine jungle depicted in the pictures. We paid less than $1800 for the 2 of us so we knew we got a good deal and you get what you pay for. From the reviews we knew it wasn't going to be a 5* hotel but we just wanted it to be clean and decent. It is a very small hotel compared to the giant resorts in the mayan. Room: We were in room 2401 which had a beautiful ocean front view. We were spitting distance from the ocean. Most of the rooms face the pool which is fine too. Our A/C was on 24/7 but it never got cooler than 25C in the room. I told the front desk it wasn't working and I did see workers go into our room but the temperature never changed. It wasn't unbearable and we could still sleep so it was ok. The room also has a ceiling fan which helped a lot. Our bed wasn't as hard as expected from the other reviews. Our room did have an oversized king bed, I'm not sure if that makes a difference in the hardness of the mattress but it was fine. Bigger pillows would have been nice though. You get 3 really little ones but they're soft and comfy. The room itself is pretty plain and simple and our housemaid kept it very clean. We tipped a couple bucks a day. Sometimes, the maid never took our money...we're not sure why. But we never worried about theft. We did have a room safe. If you're with Sunwing, they give you a deal and you pay $1/day for the room safe as opposed to the standard $3 rate. The reception on the TV sucks. You really only get one channel which is not a big deal if you're only going to be sleeping in the room anyway but we like to wind down to the TV so we watched a lot of E!. You get a mini fridge which came in handy but they only give you 4 sodas and 2 bottles of water for the entire week. You have you go and buy more bottles of water. It would be nice to have your fridge stocked daily with bottles of water which is standard in most other resorts. I really don't think that would cost the resort that much more and it's so much more convenient than refilling our bottles at bar areas. Our bathroom was fine. 3 bath towels, 2 hand towels, and 2 face towels. Replaced daily. Beach: There are a total of about 12 palapas (grass umbrella huts) on the beach. We got up at 630 everyday to get one of the last 2-3 remaining spots. So you DO have to get up early if you wants some shade for the day. It's worth it though. There are a lot of loungers in the sun and around the pool but the beaches ones are pretty much filled up by 10am. They work hard to keep the beach in front of the hotel clean. The water is warm and clear. If you want to snorkel and see more fish, you do have have to go out further into the reefs past the boats. There are a lot of little fishing boats but there's plenty of room for playing in the water. The boats are fenced off by bouys so they don't really bother you. They actually look pretty charming at night when you can see them in the moon's reflection on the water. Pool: The pool is a fair size. Decent service at the pool side bar. When we first got there, the water was green and you couldn't see the bottom of the pool. People were still swimming in it so I assumed it was ok. BUT... after a few days, we saw them do a thorough cleaning and the water went from green and murky to clear. Food: Typical of an all inclusive meal plan but it is pretty bland and not much for variety. I ate a lot of french fries and buns. It isn't bad but it's definately nothing special. If you want something fancier or more varied, 5th Ave is only a few blocks away. Service was always good for us. Everyone was courteous and kind. Internet Access Wifi only in the lobby and you have $5 for 24hrs. OR $2.50 for 1/2 hr on their computers Between you and me, we paid for wifi once on our second day there but still had access until we left. :) 5th Ave Close walk. Nice atmosphere at night. If you're looking for mexican trinkets like bracelets, and paintings, it's way cheaper at the hotel when they have their theme nights and the vendor set up their booths. We bought some embroidered name bracelets for $5 each at the hotel but on 5th, they were charging $8 and they would NOT bargain with us. Go figure... Walmart If you're feeling ambitious, you can walk to walmart to stock up your fridge. It takes about 45 mins to walk there but it's not too bad. You can walk along 5th ave for most of it and then hang a right. Just as for directions. But it's only a $5 cab ride. Tips: -bring some water noodles. They're fun to swim and play in the ocean with. -if you're considering excursions, considering taking a cab and paying at the entrance gate instead of booking through your tour company or through any vendor. It's cheaper since you're cutting out the middle man. And you can come and go as you please. -xplor - SUPER FUN!!!! only 15 min cab ride away and only $15 cab fee each way. if you buy your tickets online it's even cheaper. -xelha is great too but far to get to. great snorkeling -oxxo is like 7/11. 5 min walk from the hotel. you can buy water and snacks here- - bring some mosquito repellant for the evening. they come out at night even in the lobby -take the info on the weather network with a grain of salt. We were so worried that there were thunder showers everyday but it was clear and super hot the whole time. The hotel was decent but we probably won't go back here. The little things are lacking like stocked bottled water, tv receptions, and cold A/C. With so many resorts to choose from, doesn't make sense to sacrifice these things.

To sum up my lengthy story below; the food was terrible, you have to pay for bottled water, the pidgins and their feces eliminate your patio space, the entertainment was the pool day crew dressed up, the beds are hard as rocks, the pool is hot and the hot tub is cold and I got Giardia from their bar drinks. Here we go: I called weeks ahead to confirm my reservation and square the small things away such as having a king or queen bed. All was fine and dandy although the lady on the phone informed me I was not eligible for a suite upgrade. No problem, I just need a bed I can snuggle up to my new husband in (we did not plan to be in our room a lot). The photos of this \"resort\" are so misleading and off from what it really is. When our taxi pulled up to the hotel we thought \"Oh no\u2026this is it? This is the Grand Coco Bay?\" It is located off of the ghetto outskirts of Playa del Carmen which harbor run-down and abandoned buildings, overgrown lots and a small mix of new condos for sell to the wealthy traveler. We proceeded inside where our baggage was taken from us by the bellman. As we checked in, we were asked if we would like a security safe. Yes, we did - $3 per day for use of their safe in the room you have already paid for. We then were handed a well-used remote control with batteries hanging out the back panel. We were informed this was for our TV and we had to sign for use of this and if we did not return it we would be charged. We asked if our bags were being delivered to our room since the bellman was adamant about taking them and the desk employee responded \u201cwell, if you would like I am sure we could do that.\u201d We declined and went back to the outside of the hotel to grab our now unattended suitcases from the parking lot. As we entered our room we walked into two twin beds. We walked back down four floors (elevator did not work) to the desk and asked if there had been some kind of mistake. The woman was very friendly and gave us a different room. We walked back up four floors to a new room that had a king bed but happened to have one window and resembled a cave. We were much happier with this room because of the sleeping situation so decided to deal with it. We then noticed the infestation of pidgins on the patio. There were everywhere and so was their feces (droppings). It was down the walls, on the ground and all over the two patio chairs. After looking at the other balconies and patios we realized that they were all like this which means no patio use for us! We could not see the beach since our view was right smack into a palm tree. We settled in and headed down for dinner. The hotel is all inclusive but be aware this is according to their hours. \u201cAll Inclusive\u201d actually means from 7-10 am and 6:30-10:30pm in the cafeteria (seriously worse than high school meals in the actual cafeteria). The food is TERRIBLE and lacks anything authentic or tasty as it is bland and recycled from morning to night. Even the fruit was \u201cover-ripe\u201d. If you did not make it to the cafeteria for their meal times you would have to eat at the snack bar which offered tin trays of cold French fries, quesadillas, stale chips and ice cream. You do receive two bottles of water and four sodas in your room, but after that you must pay. We ended up buying all of our water from the hotel store (about $3 a bottle) as we will not drink the water in Mexico due to the lack of sanitation in many areas. This thought did not help me in regards to the hotel\u2019s bar as I was drinking their beer and even ventured to have a mixed drink. Shortly after my Pina Colada I came down with a terrible stomach ache and ended up sick in the bathroom for the rest of the trip. After getting home I went to the doctor and tested positive for Giardia which comes from bad food/water sources and is highly contagious. During our stay we needed to contact our transportation company (associated through the hotel) and were informed that we must call from our cell phone as the hotel will get charged $.60 for the connection. Being America, it would cost us $1.25 per minute to do this. I asked if they could do us the favor and the man at the desk refused. The next morning we went to the hotel travel agent (that we spent over $800 with over the course of our stay) and he had no problems making the call for us to get a ride back to the airport. It took him 40 seconds to make us happy. The hotel toilet leaked to the point that we had to roll our towels around the base of it to keep the floor from flooding. We changed them each evening since the front desk could not help us. There was one working light bulb in the room and one in the bathroom; all others were burned out. The shower curtain smelled so badly of mold that we had to take short showers to avoid holding our breath. We will NEVER return and do not recommend taking the chance of staying here. For the price of what we paid we could have stayed at a real resort if we had known any better.

Went with girlfriend and two kids aged 3 and 7. I will list my pros and cons: PROS- Beach: Very nice and well maintained beach, very close to any rooms. Cant really see your feet in the water because of dead coral and coral reef area were boats dock. Very shallow and not overly wavy though and no one tried to sell anything or bother you on the beach. Staff: Staf here were very good and interactive with guests, moreso then any other hotel I stayed at. Very personal with guests and they even played water volleyball with us. Most were very friendly and spoke at least some English. Customer service was good (Guest services) they called frequently to see how I was doing and if anything was okay (never had this at other resorts). I lost my wallet one day in a cab, and the bell hop Viktor was able to retrieve it for me...he was AWESOME!!! Very friedly too. Pool staff hung out with us a lot and made our trip enjoyable. They even do the shows at night which are very audience interactive as opposed to just performing a show. Had a mini disco for the kids which they enjoyed. Also, kids went to mini-club (open 9-1pm and 3-5pm; very small, but same staff from pool areas and you feel you can trust them. No issues or problems here) Cleanliness: Rooms very VERY clean...great housekeeping work. Grounds: VERY well maintained and clean, however you could here staff making general repairs and maintaining the property as early as 9 a.m. (would not recommend if you like to sleep in and can't sleep with noise). Nice pool and beautiful grounds. Location: Didnt find location to be the greatest but it was the first hotel in Playa del Carmen area, a bit far (for walking) to 5th Ave. but $5 get you there in a taxi. Food: Food was really good for the first 3 days there. I was really impressed and commented a lot on how good it was (first trip to Mexico, and compared to other places like Dominican Republic and Cuba)...however menu was very repetitive after and not alot of variety. Keep in mind though you could always get food at the snack bar that is different then the buffet (e.g. burgers, fries, nachos and cheese, and pizza were popular). CONS- Rooms: Although rooms were very clean, they were small, beds were very firm and I had issues with the room. I had to change rooms after second night because the air conditioning never went below 24 degrees celcius and I like my rooms cold. Also, the first night (Saturday) there was a wedding on-site and next to the hotel (which is private condominiums) and can hear music until well after 4 a.m. Didnt sleep well, due to hotness of room, uncomfortable beds, and noise (walls are also thin can here other rooms doors opening and voices in hallway). Our second room didnt have a functioning toilet, so got moved again, and was cooler then the other room, but after two days the air conditioner broke (started to leak water in middle of the night), and called 10 times to fix afterwards and didnt fix properly or offer to change rooms again. VERY DISAPPOINTED... was even told by maintenence that room was \"cold enough\" while I was sweating my a** off at 26 degrees. Many excuses, but no resolution to my problems...the worst part of my trip. I should also mention you only get three cans of pop and two waters stocked in your room at the begining of trip, never refilled and you have to buy your own pop at the store if you want more (although you can refill water bottle at front desk). Food/A la Carte: Good food, limited choses, and only two restaurants. Can only book each one once (unlike most places I have stayed)...didnt bother us though. Bars/Staff: Generally good bars, not overly busy. However, as mentioned but other reviews, only 1 person working pool bar most of the time when two were needed. Had to get out of pool to get drinks and often waited up to 5 minutes to recieve them. The bar staff did the best the could thought given they were by themselves, so not faults to them and they made killer drinks. 1 cook at snack bar, so hardworking, but struggled at times to keep up with all of the orders, often 20 minute wait for food there. Need more staff to assist in these areas. No bar back bringing drinks to beach area either, so not very accomodating unless you dont mind getting drinks for yourself. Bar upstairs small but decent, open from 10-2 am. Lobby bar crowded and difficult to get a drink at times, only 1 bartender there too. Everything else was enjoyable. Recommend for families. Entertainment staff, housekeepiing, security staff and bellhops were all the friendliest. Miss you all. Most of the guests were either Mexican families, or Canadian (lots of French-Canadians from Quebec also). Would reccomend if you dont mind the negatives, but I would not stay again.

This is gonna be a very mixed review because we loved alot about this hotel & some things did not like so much. So you can read it & decide for yourself. ROOMS --- very nice rooms, yes the beds are very hard but this did not bother either of us, I think the housecleaning services were wonderful, our room was always cleaned. The only problem I had with the rooms were the location of one of the bars which is right underneath the row of rooms we were at, our rooms were 2331 & 2334, I would suggest that u ask to be moved away from these rooms. very loud. not alot of tv stations in English, pretty much only TNT, cartoons & CNN. I didnt go to Mexico to watch tv, but It did rain for 3 days & not much else to do there. never had a problem with hot water or water pressure, the air worked great. GROUNDS---BEAUTIFUL, someone is always working on the grounds from scrubbing the cement around the pool to pruning trees & flowers. BEACH---AWESOME, BEAUTIFUL, STUNNING, not enough words to describe it. some people might not like all the boats in the water but we thought they added to the beautiful scenery. If you have been to some other Islands & were bugged by people on the beach to buy stuff----well that wont happen here or atleast it did not to us. very safe to walk along the beach in either direction for miles. BARS---only 3 bars lobby bar---- good bartender, only open at night, VERY VERY HOT in the lobby, it is an open air lobby with no air conditioner & no ceiling fans. pool bar--- only open until 6PM, very very busy, pretty bascially it is a swim up bar but you have a hard time getting a drink if you are in the water, you need to get out & stand in line on the other side of the bar, only 1 bartender & he cant do both sides so it seemed to us he always picked the cement side to work on sports bar---- very plain but is air conditioned, kinda very small RESTAURANTS--- did not book special resturants cause we did not bring long pants which are required for men---so I have no comment on them. the buffet was really just ok, certainly not enough of a food choice for me, they did have theme nights, asian, italian, etc... but if you dont like that kind of food then you pretty much are out of luck unless you want pizza & french fries. LOCATION--- very nice location, very close to 5th Avenue (which we loved) not to far from the airport. ENTERTAINMENT--- very nice group of entertainment people, always smiling, very talkative & friendly. Myan nite was terrific!!!!!!!! CABS--- very easy to get, they are lined up right outside the lobby. TIMESHARE----BEWARE THEY ARE EVERYWHERE FROM THE AIRPORT TO THE HOTELS, THERE WILL BE TIMESHARE PEOPLE IN YOUR HOTEL LOBBY WHO YOU WILL THINK ARE WORKING FOR THE HOTEL BUT THEY ARE NOT!!!!!!! THEY WILL OFFER YOU A TRIP TO THE SISTER HOTEL & TRY TO SELL YOU A TIMESHARE. MUSIC-----not enough music playing during the day, or evening. So over all we did have a great time at the Grand coco bay & we are not at all sorry that we went here but No we would not go back here. We are used to staying at Riu'S which are much bigger hotels. We thought we would try a smaller more quaint hotel but I think from now on we will stick with the bigger chains.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOk, but definitly not going back\u201d", "Author": "huotsky", "ReviewID": "UR114621992", "Content": "Considering the price we paid for the week, it was OK.

Obviously we like it enough to go back. The main reasons for returning are the size and the beach. Getting lost in a mega resort is not our style while being right on the beach is. We requested an ocean front room and got it. It wasn't the one that we wanted and we considered changing rooms but decided that just being in Mexico on vacation with an ocean front room was enough! If you've read any of the reviews you will know about the boats. My take on this is that, yes, there are boats in front of the resort, but they are not in the way of swimming and actually add some charm. The water is beautiful and the white sand beach is fantastic. We didn't partake in any of the dinner shows, just because we had seen them before and usually by the time we were ready for dinner, they were already over!!! The food at CB is nothing special, but there is always something to eat, if you aren't too picky! Drinks were always good and I agree with the tipping. While there this year, I experienced a medical issue that required a doctor's care. I talked with the concierge and she called their on-call doctor who was in our room within an hour. He was very professional and knew exactly what was wrong and how to treat the problem. It cost a little more than what it would have cost at home, but just knowing that if you need help, there is somebody there to lend a hand. I was very impressed by this, especially being in a foreign country. We had a coffee pot in the room, but no coffee! They would never leave any, even when tips were left! We also had a clock in our room which I see alot of people on here saying they did not have. It might be the room choice? So, besides the 7 hour layover on the way there, the cortisone shot, and a small issue with our transportation to and from the resort, it was a great vacation!

Yeah, it looks fine in the photos, but the coral is ALL DEAD and as soon as ya take a couple steps out, your up to mid-shin level in muddy water. Locals fish right off shore, in front of the resort. I may be somewhat of a beach snob, to be honest. Being to Cuba, Aruba, US & BVI, but I expect when going to the \"Caribbean\" side of Mexico for the beaches to be somewhat, Caribbean.

About a 30 minute cab ride from our resort. The cabbie(s) and the bell man, got together and decided that in order to take 4 mini vans (6 people each), will cost $240 per van. There and back.

The room was large, clean, had water and sodas (replenished once per stay) in the fridge and a fully stacked bathroom (including mouthwash). Yes, there was no clock in the room and, as the management already commented on one previous review, it did make for a much more relaxing stay. If you'd like to keep track of time, bring a watch or check the wall at the front desk: there you will find clocks, each set to one of the major time zones. THE FOOD: Nothing outstanding in terms of selection but certainly plenty to choose from and everything very tasty. A very nice fresh juice bar for breakfast (watermelon, papaya, beat, grapefruit, orange, carrot), all kinds of cereal and toppings (nuts, granola, oats, even flax seed!), fresh cheeses and cold cuts, various flavours of yoghurt, pastries, fruits, and a whole array of the more-fatty hot food selection, including a made-to-order egg station. Lunch and dinner always had a number of proteins (fish/seafood, chicken, pork and/or beef), various salads, and all kinds of other goodies. Really good food. The one thing that bothered me each and every day is that, as one reviewer already noted, there was very little Mexican food. Note to management: Set up a Mexican corner where one can get true and pure Mexican food every day. (And no, a Mexican theme night is not enough.) Those who travel to Mexico want to experience Mexico and that includes food. Have fresh salsas. Have tacos, tortas, enchiladas, burritos (Mexican, not Tex-Mex), maybe huevos rancheros for breakfast. And make sure there are fresh chilles! The one and only disappointment during my stay at your hotel was the lack of good Mexican food. THE BARS: This holds true for every place on earth (maybe with the exception of England, where they refuse tips): Tip a bartender once, he'll be your friend for ... at least, a week. I didn't have any issues getting a good drink in any of the bars. (BTW: Also bring a tip for the lady that makes your morning omelette. The poor woman has a tough job, working the hotplate in this heat.) The bartenders were friendly and smiling. And if you don't get a smile, it's because they're working hard. THE ROOM: Large, clean - see above. THE LOBBY SILVER STORE: Negotiate ;-) THE SPA: Either bring cash or make sure you agree on a price in pesos before they swipe your card. You'll be given prices in US dollars but they'll charge your card in pesos. Their exchange rate was, last week, $175 pesos per $1 US dollar. The lobby exchange was $110 pesos to a dollar. In short, if you're charged in pesos at the spa, you'll end up paying more. Other than that, great service. Ask for current promotions. THE BEACH: Very nice and clean. There could be more shade but then again, one can always find shade. The beach is about a 2 min walk around the pool from the lobby - the farthest point. You're always within your room's reach. It's too bad that all those boats have to be anchored right outside of the swimming area. If the boats bother you (they're anchored, not zooming by there and back), walk a couple of steps to the left or to the right and ... no more boats. The water was unbelievable! THE POOL: I don't care much for pools with swim-up bars. OVERALL, a very nice place to stay. The 5th and 10th are about 10-15 min away on foot or 3 min and $3-5 by taxi. The beach and the ocean are clean and inviting. The service and the staff are great. I will go back to the Grand Coco Bay again and would recommend it to all but the pretentious. LAST TIP: Buy tequila at the duty-free on your way out. Nice selection and great prices. Prices in Playa vary a lot but all were higher than the duty-free shop at the airport.

The food was OK, it wasn't like eating in a restaurant every night. I would say the food was home cooked, it was edible mostly tasty and filled the stomach. Every night they had a theme night aka Italian, Mexican, and Chinese. Their omelette bar at breakfast was to die for, I'm already craving one. The pool was very large and very clean and there were several lifeguards on duty. Throughout the day they did activities with the guests like bingo or volleyball on the beach. At night time they'll also have 'casino night' or Mexican hat dancers. Vendors also come in a few times a week and you get nice gifts or souvenirs and barter with the vendors. There was lots of security on the resort which was comforting but I felt safe and thought it was a little too much. There is no air conditioning in the common areas like the lobby. There's wireless internet in the lobby for $5 but if you lose the password they charge you again despite it being the same password. The rooms are nice and with great air conditioning but the beds are hard, however I got used to them. However, while we were there they did construction which started at 8am. I'm a deep sleeper and housekeeping came 3 times at 9am while I was in bed and they'll forever have nightmares for how they saw me. You'll see a lot of boats in the water and staff can't do a thing about them but there is a blocked off area just for swimmers.

The boats out front are unfortunate and the allotted beach area is tiny, but like others have said it is surrounded by public beach areas which are easy enough to move to, if you don't mind not having a lounge chair or palapa. Hm, the lounge chairs are actually crammed together, there were so many more than needed, which I found to be odd and uncomfortable. I thought it was also highly unfortunate that the beds (cabanas) were $30 a day to rent. Meanwhile I didn't see a single person rent one during our entire stay so I guess it was a bit pricey for most people. I felt the resort nickle and dimed us, with the bed rental, how they don't give you soda and water in your fridge throughout your stay, and how tough it was to get a coffee maker! They say coffee makers are standard but as another reviewer remarked, it is quite a struggle to get one. We didn't have one so I asked the front desk about it and told only ocean view rooms get one. We had a partial ocean view, although when booking the trip I had the option of selecting full ocean view for the price I was paying. . so I told the front desk woman that and she said, ok, she will give us a \"free upgrade\" to an ocean view room just so we could get the coffee maker. It had a nicer tv so I was happy about that. . but guess what? There was no coffee maker. I called the next day to ask about it, they said they'd send one up. Waited a few hours, called again and was told that I'd have to pay extra for it?! I explained I had moved rooms just to get a coffee maker and they said ok, they will send one. Hours later, still no coffee maker. I think I called 4x throughout that day and evening before I got one. I got one packet of decaf coffee to go with it, no cream or sugar. I only wanted it to make tea anyway, I just went to the walmart in playa del carmen and bought my own tea and milk, finally, and that was that. It was just odd how hard it was to get one when they advertise it as a feature of their rooms. The rooms are alright. Not super luxury, but nicely designed and sufficient. The bathrooms are also fine though the bath tubs could use updating. The towels aren't fluffy and soft and they don't give you a bunch of stuff, just a little soap and shampoo and conditioner/lotion. I don't use the hotel stuff anyway but it would have been nice to receive more, like a shower cap, sewing kit, etc. I also thought they were cheap when it came to the food budget. The chefs do an excellent job with the budget they have, I give them an A+ for effort, but unfortunately it is obvious to me, a person with 8 yrs of restaurant experience, that they aren't given much to work with. Still, the food was good, some dishes were very good, some were so-so. I wouldn't go here for the food. For example, I noticed they didn't have great cuts of meat, you won't see a whole steak or even chicken breast, but plenty of stewed meat dishes. Vegetarians would not eat well at all, though they do have salad selections and some side dishes that probably are vegan (not much and it would be hard to tell.) The staff, outside of the front desk staff which I found to be a bit difficult, are outstanding! They seemed like very good people and I hesitated to write anything negative at all because of them. The location is excellent, right in Playa del Carmen, less than an hr from Cancun airport and about 15 mins away from Xcaret eco park. To sum up, I think this resort could be so much better than it is if they just increased the quality of ingredients and added a few more touches to the rooms.

Just returned from a week of 88 degree sunny days with a tropical breeze. Perfect weather began the journey. I'm not a beginner at travel to Cancun and Mayan Riviera as this was the 15th trip to the region, so I do have some experience. Booked with Apple and the trip from the airport was uneventful in a good way, though did have to drop several others off first, which is normal, so took 90 minutes to arrive. I was a bit concerned arriving as it seemed we were in a pretty dicey section of Playa, but the resort was separated by barrier from the town and the entire time there felt secluded and not hindered by proximity. In fact it was nice to be 10 min walk from 5th avenue and scores of restaurants and shopping! Or you could walk there via the beach and end up near the ferry and the Royal Resort...which looked pretty awesome...except very few of it's rooms were near the beach! Anyway the Coco Bay had a small adequate gym. Decent open air lobby with great reception desk and bellmen. Lobby bar right there to, though didn't open til 6. The pool was good size though not mega resort size, which was fine. One ample swim up bar (which stayed open til 630 which is the latest I've encountered) with a regular bar on the other side. No problems with drink quality. They made the drinks how you wanted them! The food was probably the only minor issue. Not great...though by no mean bad. Only one of the 3 of us got ill during the week. I didnt...and figure a week in Mexico without breaking open the Imodium is a successful journey! They had two ala carte restaurants, Mexican and Italian. Only tried the Italian and it was good. A couple days they got the grill going on the beach and and cooked up some shrimp, clams and crabs...though if you're a seafood person like me, it's pretty scarce in general as is the case with most all inclusives. There is a snack bar right by the swim up bar that made good burgers, dogs, philly roast beef sandwiches, wings, pizza etc. The beach was fine, and very close. Boats out front were no issue. Walking slightly in either direction and you were in wide open beach again. My favorite part about the place was its small size. I've been to several large resorts like Iberostar and Barcelo and it takes 20 minutes to get to the pool, beach. lobby, restaurants etc. Nothing here was more than 2 or 3 minutes away. If you forgot something in the room you're back in a flash. The lobby bar was 30 seconds from my room. That was great!

When we checked in on April 10th we got our room and it was a double room, we had requested an ocean view king room.

Well the other 2 couples we were with did not upgrade and got a better view then we did. So unless you are going to upgrade to ocean front I would not waste the extra money.

I think in the hotel industry, the star rating is based on the facilities at hand, however, I believe, we all think the higher the star rating the better the hotel all round, this being the case, I would rate the Grand Coco Bay at best 3 star and overpriced, I would not advise it be avoided, just be aware of what you will be getting.

We found this very disrespectful as most ppl then left their chairs emty till 10am. 4 hours with no one on the chairs was a little nerve racking. especially when it says at the towel place that you can NOT save chairs with towels.

Our stay was terrible due to the overall poor service. This place is a dump as compared to other all inclusive resorts in the area. It reminded me of a very cheap motel. We book what was labeled \"all inclusive\" on expedia. It came as a shock to discover we were on the European Plan. Warning-read the fine print when you book. We ended up shelling out 200.00 more per person once we were there and that was a negotiated price. The hotel was overbooked upon arrival so we were shipped off to Sandos for 2 nights. This was a good thing because the Sandos has superior service to Coco Bay. We then spent our first day at Coco at the pool. The drinks are terrible and the bartenders at the pool bar are very grumpy. The sandwich at the pool place was the grossest thing I've ever tasted. We had no water for hours for our first night at Coco and then we had only cold water in our room. Other people were being upgraded out of the resort mid-week due to overbooking and I asked to be moved. We went to Riu Tequila for 1 glorious night. This place was heaven on earth. The food, drinks and service were the best I've ever seen. Complete opposite of Grand Coco Bay. Alfonso at the front desk at Coco was not nice at all. He was extremely rude. Zoila one of the only helpful people working there and tried diligently to make our stay better. There's no consistency. The drinks in the lobby are decent but then the pool bar is nasty. None of the workers seem happy. Noone smiles and they seemed forced when they do speak. When we arrived back at Coco Bay for the 2nd time I asked if we could be moved again. We ended up going back to Riu Tequila for our last night. The end result is that we spent 4 nights at other resorts and 3 nights at Coco. Thank goodness for their overbooking problem because I would have hated my trip if I spent all 7 nights at Coco. Also, I swear there was a security camera on the ceiling in the 2nd room they put us in so check your ceiling carefully. The Italian and Mexican restaurants were surprising good but the cafe (buffet) is almost inedible. It's just not good and low rent.

I\u2019ve also stayed at the Reefclub, Riu Tequila, Barcelo Maya Colonial and Catalonia Tulum in the past 10 years. The resort really has a kind of cozy feel to it because of the size and how all the rooms face inward toward the pool. It only takes a couple of minutes to walk anywhere on the property. The food was quite tasty in the buffet at all meals, the snack bar was good, and the Italian Restaurant was very good. There isn\u2019t the variety or fancy display as at some of the larger resorts, but we weren\u2019t expecting that either. The rooms were very clean and very quiet at night which was important to us. Just could use a bit of paint and minor repairs in the bathroom. The beach was nice, but we had to get up at 5 am to get a palapa reserved, 6 am for a beach chair in the sun. The beach is nice for swimming, but the narrow stretch of sand makes it so your chairs are lined up like on a cruise ship. The boats in the water in front do take away from the relaxing feeling of looking out at open ocean. The beaches just north and south are excellent. We didn\u2019t sit at the pool, but it looked nice. The drinks were like at most all inclusives, basic. The things that really stood out for us at this resort were the proximity to town, being able to walk long distances on the beach in both directions, the cozy feel of the resort and mostly the staff was all great. The entertainment people are always in a good mood, not too pushy to join in games, etc. They work from 8:30 am until 10:00 pm and get one day off a week. We didn\u2019t sit at the pool, but it looked nice. The guy in the Lomas Travel office in the lobby was really good too. He was very friendly and helpful. He set us up with a trip to Coba. I would say that Coco Bay should be rated as a 3 \u2013 3.5 star resort based on Mexican standards. They shouldn\u2019t be marketing it as a 4 star because I think it disappoints people if they are expecting more. The guests were about 90% French Canadians, who we found to be very rude, but we just avoided them and all was fine. We are from western Canada.

Somewhere that had decent food and not a lot of focus on things like massive rooms or flat screen t.v.'s(I mean really don't you just use your room for sleeping anyways?) We booked with a travel agent who told us it was a 4 star,small and right on the beach with good food and selection. Perfect! Overall I can't say it was a terrible experience but it was a shock. Check-in was easy. Our room was what we were expecting. Found out the fridge only gets stocked once which was strange but no big deal and eventhough my boyfriend and I aren't there to watch t.v. a couple more English channels would have been nice. The grounds were very well maintained, clean and security was apparent. The beach was nicer than some other hotels beach fronts however you have to be out at the crack of dawn if you want a beach chair. Something that we found annoying is the lack of alarm clock or any clock in are room for that matter. We had to rely on wake-up calls,sometimes the t.v. or the lobby to find out what time it was. Towels ran out so plan ahead. We never used the pool however it looked clean. Staff were friendly. Everyone seemed to have a friendly, fun attitude. Poolside activities were organized by a few young people who were very friendly, respectful and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Now the food, you may go hungry. My boyfriend and I aren't picky but some days we didn'y eat much at all. Breakfasts were usually quite good. Eggs, pancakes, sausages, cereal. However you wash it all down with powdered milk or Tang. No orange juice. Lunch was a gamble and dinner was usually the worst. However if I had to choose, Italian night was the best. We only ate at the restaurant once because we couldnt be bothered to get up early and stand in line for an hour to make a reservation. Everything is horribly slow. 15mins in Canada equals an hour in Grand Coco Bay. Drinks were okay but nothing fancy. Not like you see in the commercials. No fruit and all are served in plastic juice glasses. Very inconsistant. Sometimes not enough booze, sometimes too much sometime the ice was in big chunks. It was nice that this hotel was close to the airport(about 45mins) and seemed to be in between attractions(about 1/2hr from everything) the trip advisor was very friendly,helpful and seemed to know what he was talking about. My only warning is this: EVERYONE and i mean EVERYONE sells timeshares and hotel memberships. Don't even consider giving anyone your time! Or think \"well this one sounds different\" it isn't, it's a rip off and they become extremly rude once you tell them you aren't interested.

My boyfriend and I were relaxing on the beach enjoying our snacks and strawberry daiquiris. We were soon joined by 2 male friends who were staying at another hotel. Our friends stopped by the beach to say hello and chat since many of us were staying at this hotel for a wedding! Next thing you know, the security guard comes over and says the lounge chairs are only for guests. Ok, but I'm sitting on the chair talking to my friend. 15 minutes later, Guillermo, appears--I think he's part of management because he was dressed in slacks with close-toed shoes and was never seen again by us. He crouches over my boyfriend and tells him in an intimidating tone and third person that he should know better, that drinks and snacks are only for guests of the Grand Coco Bay. He says in an intimidating tone, \"do I make myself clear?\" My problem with this scene is that Guillermo treated us like criminals instead of paying guests!! First of all, we were not sharing our drinks/snacks with anyone. Second of all, he was very rude and not courteous. We were confused by the situation and didn't understand what Guillermo was referring to. He didn't let us ask questions. Poor customer service! We were very uncomfortable by the situation and left to Mamitas Beach Club to meet our other friends. Moral of the story: if you don't want to be told who you can and cannot talk to, if you don't want to feel threatened when you're lounging around in the sun, then DON'T come here! PROS: 1) Breakfast at the buffet is good although lunch and dinner could do better, especially for the price. 2) Luis, the bartender, was very nice and made us a very cute/special drink on our first night there. Claudia, the lady who greets you at the restaurant is always friendly and approachable! The chef who makes the breakfast omelets is very nice and made delicious omelets and chilaquiles! 4) I liked the size of the pool and it's close proximity to the beach. 5) Most of the employees spoke great English! I was impressed.\u00a0 CONS: 1) There is no internet in the rooms. You have to go to the lobby to use the hotel's wi-fi (which costs $5 US dollars per day and is very unreliable). 2) The ocean in front of the hotels beach is full of boats, which distracts from the nice view. Plus, it's the only hotel with boats parked along it's ocean view!! 3) The beds are super uncomfortable and hard. It appears as though our bathroom towels were just folded instead of washed on a daily basis! 4) The hotel's iron was old and ruined my boyfriend's dress shirt. 5) The room's outlets did not work. Multiple times we thought we were charging our camera or hair straightener, but in reality the plugs were not working! 6) Hotel should state on website that people are limited to ONE reservation at the specialty restaurants per stay! We were quite surprised by the false advertisement. 7) The pool and jacuzzi/hot-tubs are cold! Turn up the heat! 8) The bicycles we used from the hotel (for free since we had all-inclusive) were not adjusted for use by women or people of average height (5 ft 6 in); only a giant could comfortably dismount those bicycles. 9) I would have preferred the activities personnel would have played tropical/Latin music by the pool instead of English/country/mainstream music. 10) The hotel is definitely not for young, hip couples looking to have a relaxing and fun time.

We arrived very late at night and were checked in promptly and efficiently for the hour. My husband and I enjoy the smaller resorts not having to travel up and down on elevators or shuttle to the beach. The bartenders were very good and made some excellent drinks. I especially liked the Moonlight Surprise made by Israel and I believe it was Gabriele (it was made with chocolate sauce). The buffet for the most part had a good variety....some days were better than others. However, I do think they need more staff in the buffet restaurant because one person is doing too many jobs. There should be people just clearing and setting tables, people getting drinks and serving coffee/tea, and people replacing empty trays of food. The chefs shouldn't have to go at any given time to fill the bread trays at breakfast or cheese trays or whatever as they are very busy cooking to order as at breakfast making omeletes. We were at the resort for two weeks and ate at the Italian and Mexican alacarte restaurants two times each. The food was excellent. They have improved the method of making reservations where you go up to the restaurants between 9 - 11. We have always been in the habit of getting up early to save chairs on the beach but not at 5:00 - 5:30 A.M. if you want to get some shade. Even though we are Canadian we found it very difficult trying to communicate with most of the French Canadians. They did not seem to want to try to communicate with any english speaking Canadians and found the majority of them very rude. We enjoy walking the beach and it is excellent for that purpose. There are many fishing/snorkelling/scuba excursion boats anchored in front of hotel but that's because there is a reef about 200 yards out in front of this hotel which makes it convenient and excellent for anyone loving to snorkel .

The main reason for going was to regroup and figure out where life was going next. The plan was to hang out on the beach during the day and Salsa Dance (or any Latin Music really) at night. I am also a big food person and love real Mexican food. I got to hang out on the beach which was nice (I mainly stayed on the local part of the beach as the hotel beside GCB played loud music that I did not care for.). I was not impressed with the food at all - I do not come to Mexico to eat Chinese. I simply wanted Tacos - fresh fish - local fruits - specialties. Roberto, my waiter the 1st night was very nice and finally ended up getting me some heated tortillas and some grilled chicken (which was very good) so I could make tacos. It was completely unfathomable to me that I was in Mexico and could not get tacos. The restaurant where they had Italian and Mexican food at night reservation were required. You had to do that by 11am. The 1 day I remembered to ask the 1st opening they had was at 930 pm. There is a 'disco\" I guess at the hotel but they do not play Latin music. From what I understood most of the places close by played all American or Electronic kind of music. Neither of which I wanted to dance too. My option was to take a taxi and go across town. Viktor, bellman was super nice though and very helpful. He is a great asset to the hotel. I had 3 services at the Spa. They were nicely performed by Karoline (I think). The price list I got at check in was no where close to the prices that I was charged. Later I also realized that the discount I was suppose to receive was never deducted. I told the manager at check out that they should not be handing out brochures with services $20 less then what they spa was actually charging. Before I left on my trip I had contacted the resort for spa price list and wi-fi info. It took me 3 emails to get the price list and I never got the wi-fi question answered. For 30 mins of access on their computer it was 2,500 pesos. I thought that was a little high. I do not drink much but I do like Tequila - they only had 3 brands & none of them where very impressive for being in Mexico. My Mexican friends would have considered them low grade tequilas. So if you are not a big food person and don't go to Mexico to actually eat Mexican food, don't want to dance and mainly want to lay out on the beach then this hotel is suitable enough.

We arrived after midnight, I had requested a room with a view of the ocean which we got, a room over the lobby with a view of the ocean but the palm trees were in the way, I was still very happy, I got exactly what I asked for. I would request a room away from the lobby next time though, it was a little noisy as the lobby bar was right below us. The room was very clean and simple, we never had a problem with bugs, but then agian we never brought food into the room. Always, no matter what time of the day there was lots of hot water, the air conditioning worked and kept the room nice and cool, as with the fridge, no problems. Our maid was awesome, extra towels, clean sheets everyday, and she did a great job cleaning the room daily. When you check in, you get two bottles of water and 4 cans of pop, you have to pay for anything over that. You can take your water bottles to the swim up bar and refill them with cold water during the day or the lobby. There was a coffee maker in the room, but no coffee. We had a plasma television, there were several english channels including two HBO movie channels for those evenings you prefer to stay in your room to unwind from the long gorgeous days. I am not complaining about anything here, just giving anyone the heads up. I would stay here again for several reasons 1- the great price for two weeks we paid out of Toronto for two weeks 1100 plus taxes 2- I loved the size of the resort, you could get from one end to the other in a couple of minutes 3- the location of the resort, it`s an easy walk to 5th ave. or a 50 peso cab ride 4- The friendly staff, always remembered you and your choice of drink, the recreation staff were very good and funny and remembered your name Remember, you get what you pay for so if you are looking for some place luxurious and fancy then you need to fork out more cash. The price we payed would have gotten us a nicer hotel but for one week, that was a sacrifice I was willing to take, an extra week in the Playa area was more than worth it to me. It also allowed us to leave the resort for an overnight in Isla Mujeres, we spend two beautiful days there, which I consider a bonus. There is so much to see and do in the area that we tend to leave the resort alot for many day trips, we just get on the ADO or a collectivo and go wherever we want to, it`s so easy to get around. We keep going back to the area because there is so much more to discover. And for those days you just want to relax and hang out at the resort, the pool is nice, it was clean, and yes it was cold, but any hotel I have been to (even the 5 stars) the pool is cold when you go there in January, it warm up considerably while we were there. The pool was very refreshing. And yes, everyone there plays the towel game too, so if you want a prime spot either on the beach or by the pool you need to get up early and leave your towel on your chair. If you upgrade your room to ocean front, you automatically get a cabana everyday that you are there and your fridge is stocked as much as you like. The price varies for this, depending on who you speak with at the front desk, we were quoted 50 dollars a day, another couple we spoke with paid less than that. The food was ok, breakfast was always great, but remember the money you saved by booking this resort, you can now go into town whenever you want and have something different on 5th ave. The snack bar was ok as well. I did enjoy the italian restaurant upstairs and we never had any problems making a reservation. Also, a vacation is what you make of it, and if you know before hand that this is NOT a 5 star, maybe a 3. I knew all the pros and cons when I booked, and I was happy with my choice. When you break it down into dollar per day including flight, it cost us 78 dollars a day. Where else can you stay, including your flight, eat and drink all you want for that amount, think about that! Wow, I think thats awesome. Plus you get the beautiful warm, turquoise ocean steps away from your room, not a 15 minute trolley or train ride like at the huge mega resorts, it`s a no brainer to me. How much was that drink you had last time you went out to a bar/restaurant at home, or the brunch you went out for? Would I go back again? Hell, YES. That`s my two cents worth.

Although reviews I read seemed to be mixed, most complaints were minor, so we decided to go ahead and book. From the easy and stress free check-in (which took a whole 5 minutes) to the equally simple check-out (another 5 minutes) it was a pleasure to stay at this hotel. Due to the low cost ($1400 for 14 days) you need to realize that you won't be staying at a 5 plus star luxury resort, but I was still very impressed with almost everything. The property itself is small and compact, which is a relief if you don't want a map just to find the breakfast buffet in the morning. All rooms have, at the minimum, a pool view and partial ocean view, and at the maximum, a full ocean view. The rooms themselves are fairly simple but spacious. They are very clean and well maintained and met all our requirements. The grounds and buildings are also well maintained and very attractive. The staff was polite and effecient and any requests or small issues that came up (eg. asking for extra blankets, light bulbs burnt out in the bathroom) were dealt with immediately. The hotel is on a pretty, white sand beach which is small but seems to have more then enough room for all hotel guests. As with most resorts, you'll need to get out to the beach by 7am at the latest if you want to reserve yourself a chair. Speaking of the beach chairs, they are very \"well used\" and most need to be replaced, however this was only a minor annoyance. The pool is also very nice, unfortunately since it's not heated it tends to be on the cold side. Because of that, it's definitely under-used by the hotel guests, which is a shame. There are also 3 \"hot-tubs\" complete with multiple water jets that are also not heated, which I found a bit odd. Sure would have been nice to have access to an actual heated hot tub on some of those cooler nights... This hotel seems to cater to mostly French Canadians from Quebec and our own experience here was that many of these people were very rude to anyone who didn't speak their language and, most importantly, rude to and very demanding of the hardworking hotel staff. Although we found it annoying, the real concern was that anyone would treat the staff this way...they work extremely hard for next to nothing (bartenders get approximately 55 pesos for an 8 hour shift which is about $6 a day). I'm hoping that this is an exception and not the rule at this hotel; hopefully we just happened to run into a few \"bad apples\". Of course, this is not the resort's fault, but as we did experience this repeatedly on our stay here, I thought it may be worth mentioning. Another thing to note, if you are the type of person who spends most of their time on the resort, you will likely be a bit bored here, especially on overcast, rainy or cool days when hanging out on the beach or by the pool isn't an option. The ammenities of a larger resort are obviously lacking and you'll need to be able to entertain yourself. I'd suggest getting off the resort on these days...Playa Del Carmen's 5th Avenue is only a few blocks away and the town itself is very safe and fun to explore. Not to mention the whole area is full of amazing eco-parks as well as all the Mayan ruin sites, so there's really no reason you need to be bored. One word of warning, avoid booking anything through the resort's dive shop, book all excursions through your representative instead. We booked a catamaran tour with \"David\"...he assured us that there would be snorkelling (which was the whole purpose of going in the first place) and also assured us there would be life jackets for snorkelling and parasailing on the way home. He also mentioned that in the case of bad weather, the trip would be rescheduled. The day of the trip was cold, rainy and windy. The trip was most definitely not rescheduled, there were no life jackets in the boat for the snorkeling, and when we got to the snorkelling site, there were actually whitecaps on the reef which deterred many people. No parasailing was even offered on the way home and it was basically a miserable and cold day for us all. We chatted with some of the other people on the bus ride back after the trip and it was pretty much unanimous that nobody had a good time and everyone felt cheated. We also found out that David apparently was offering the trip at different prices to different people; we paid $12 more per person then some of the other people on the trip! Finally, the food at this resort may be a concern to some people. I am not a picky person when it comes to resort food, but even I was unimpressed with what was available! Selection is very limited and some of the dishes are downright bizarre...scrambled eggs mixed with peas?!? Most of the food is also cold unless you're first in line at the buffet. Fortunately, there are 2 a la carte restaurants that you can book as many times during your stay as you like...the hook is that you need to book them first thing in the morning at breakfast and the line starts forming at about 6:15am (breakfast starts at 7am). If you're unwilling to line up early, you can still generally get a booking, but usually you'll have to settle for what's left which is usually the 9:30pm time slot. My suggestion...eat breakfast at the buffet (their best meal), lunch at the snack bar and dinner at one of the two a la carte restaurants (Mexican or Italian). Overall, I had a great time in the Riviera Maya and was pleased with the Grand Coco Bay accomadations. If I ever do return to Mexico, I would definitely stay here again and reccommend that everyone else to do the same!", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "prgeorge", "Title": "\u201cGrand Coco Bay - We would go again\u201d", "Author": "two_boots_traveling", "ReviewID": "UR94870308", "Content": "Grand Coco Bay: We (4 of us) spent 10 days a Grand Coco Bay, I would return again. Because of the resorts size (smaller than average) and location the northern limit of Playa Del Carmen, was what really made out trip memorable. The size. You got to know the staff, and they got to know you and remember who you are. The staff were always polite curious and professional. The same staff were there from 3 yrs prior and remembered who we were and welcomed us back for the second time. The location was perfect for us. If you wanted quite and solitude you walked north on the public beach for 3 km before you reached the next resort. We always felt safe as there were security staff for adjacent private land approx every 600m. The public beach was also cleaned every few days from any debris washed up on shore. If you wanted people and activity you could walk in the opposite direction and have resort after resort with lots of other beach goers. As well it was a 5 min walk to the north end of 5th Ave where you could find all the tacky tourist shops and and numerous restaurants above and the street and at street level. And talking about restaurants if you are looking for something a little different try a Place called \u201cAlux\u201d (pronounced Alush long u). It is off the tourist route but only about a $5 taxi ride from the the resorts. The atmosphere is indescribable and the food was amazing ( plan on $25 Canadian per meal). A very unassuming place from the outside but amazing on the inside, but I will not spoil the surprise. The beach is somewhat small in width, but if you want more space just pull your lounger or towel over to the public portion of the beach. The depth of the beach is about 20m. The sand is the consistency of confection sugar. The swimming area is great for kids as there is a reef about 300m off shore that protects the beach from any waves > 2'. Even when the red flags are out it is safe for small kids to play in the water. Waiters will not serve your drink to you on the beach you have to get up off your chair and walk over to the bar, probably not a bad thing. If you are good swimmer skip the $40 snorkel fee at the dive shop and just swim out to the reef in front of te resort. Just as good and will save you some money, just keep your wits about you as you will be swimming through where the tourist boats are tied up. The food was always fresh and well stocked. But you will need to get out of your comfort zone to try other foods. The fish was always great tasting, and make sure you try the bruschetta on Italian night. If you want easy access to pool and bar and snack bar stay on ground floor, if you're looking for a good nights sleep, second and third floor. The travel agent in the lobby beside the jewelry shop is very helpful, low pressure sales, and reasonably priced. Juan Carlos Cano was very helpful when we missed a booking and re-booked with no additional costs. Our adult kids went out to coco bongos with the activity staff. Just picked up the tickets meet in the lobby. The staff got them there and got them back. This is not a 5 star resort, but if your are looking for the above, clear water, great beach, clean site, reasonable good food, and access to quiet or activity I would recommend this resort. We found the resort to be a good place for the budget conscious traveler. In short We would go again.

The size of the hotel was perfect as the rooms, pool, food, drinks and the beautiful beach were all so close to each other. The food was so-so. I found the breakfast buffet to be by far the best meal. Went to the Mexican restaurant once and it was good, however could not get into the Italian restaurant the few times we tried as it was already booked (sometimes before 7am). However, it gave us all the more reason to go into town in the evenings, walk 5th ave and try some of the great restaurants there. Yes, the beds are hard - so what. Yes, the walls are very thin and it is a bit loud in the lobby in the evenings, however I was there for a fun, relaxing time and that is exactly what I got. You get what you pay for. It is not a big fancy resort, however I didn't pay enough money to stay at one of those resorts. Plus, like I said, the size of the hotel was great as you didn't need to take a shuttle to the beach or to a restaurant. The beach out front was absolutely amazing and made the whole trip worth it. Just make sure you get out early to reserve your beach chair as they fill up quickly. It is a short and cheap cab ride to 5th ave or you can also walk and it is only takes about 20 minutes which is nice as you do spend most of your time eating, drinking and laying around in the sun. All in all, a great hotel worth every penny. I would go again in a heartbeat. Do not be swayed by some of the negative reviews here.

Very relaxing and nice. Definately not a party place for the young at heart. The nightime entertainment was excellent, especially Sunday nights. The lobby bar was excellent, with Louis the bartender always pouring the drinks and making you laugh. As for the girl who complained about her Dad getting Neumonia from mouldy rooms, I call Bull###. As unfortunate as it was that he was sick in the hospital, you yourself told me he was sick prior to coming there from Kelowna.

Take note; this resort is not a short walk from fifth ave, It is a 50 peso taxi from it. The resort offers a great range for Its all inclusive offers, including snorkeling and kayaking off of the beach, and of course all the drinks you can sink, but mind you, they are in the business to make money. They do let reps from other tourism agency's on the resort to get you to go out and go SCUBA or on a boat, or to another resort or go do other things. They charge $6 for 24 hours of WIFI, which you can only get in the lobby. They charge $3 a night for the safe in your own room.

The rooms are very modest, but spotless. The beds were very hard (not uncommon in Mexico), and the pillows quite small. The resort itself is well taken care of, but older. There is a fridge in each room that upon arrival has 4 cans of pop, which are the only complimentary beverages (outside of the 2 bottles of water) that will be placed in your fridge for the entire week. You must hang on to your 2 bottles from the water in order to fill them as required, as you are not given anymore bottled water during your stay. They do have a number of filling stations for your water bottle(s). There is also an electronic/programmable safe in each room that they have an extra charge for - $1 to $3 per day, depending on who your tour operator is. The buffet did not have a lot of selection. You could get a fresh omlette or a fresh wafle for breakfast daily. There was not a lot of fresh fruit - no apples, banana, etc. You could usually find some pineapple and papaya. The Italian restaurant is quite good, probably the best place to dine at the resort. They also have a snackbar where you can find fries, burgers, wings, etc. Unfortunately, every single person in our group was sick due to the food, and each for a number of days. We have been home for 2 days now, and after talking with some of our friends found that they, like us, are still feeling the effects. I have been to Mexico many, many times (I usually go a couple times a year) and I, nor the rest of my family, have EVER been sick like this. The pool water is rather cool, but the weather is quite hot, so not so bad, right? ;) This hotel sits directly on the beach. The beach is rather small and there are always boats docked out front, somewhat blocking the view. The hotel has 4 kayaks and 2 boogie boards for guest use. People in our group used both. The water in front of the resort is very calm for the most part and is not the greatest for boogie boarding, but very good if you have little ones that want to go in the ocean. Grand Coco Bay is a $5 taxi ride to downtown Playa. Well worth the trip! Most of the people in our group went to Explore (the park/attraction) and loved it. We deep sea fished with Captain Rick's and had a great time.

We chose Coco Bay because it was the only resort in that part of Mexico that accomodated both what we were looking for and our travel schedule. This is what we liked about Coco Bay: 1) It's a family resort, and we find children highly entertaining--particularly now that ours are grown, and we can just sit back and enjoy the show! 2) It's small, and everything is in close proximity. If you're on the ground level (as we were), the patio door opens onto grass, and then right there is the snack bar, pool bar, and the beach only a few steps further. And a ramp that takes you up to the front desk and lobby bar. I hope that doesn't give the impression that it's crowded; it's just comfortably close. 3) The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Their English is good, and we were never frustrated with language barriers. 4) Rooms were clean and modestly comfortable. Beds are firm, but we like that. I would suggest avoiding rooms 2129 - 2133, as they are right under the ramp entrance and guest-use computer--but they were quick to relocate us :-) 5) Ah, the beach! It's clean, it's soft, and it's white; however, it's small, and a bit crowded. Because Coco Bay is the first of a string of beach-front resorts in Playa del Carmen, you can take a 10-minute walk south, past all the other resorts and people (always interesting), which takes you into town and some great shopping and restaurants on 5th Avenue. But if you turn north, you can walk or jog for a couple of kms of relatively quiet beach. Several locals may be fishing on the water's edge, but they were always friendly and quite tolerant of us (I ran into their fishing lines more than once!). 6) There is a TV in the room. Normally, I would not consider this a positive element, as watching a man flip through channels is not how I like to relax; but we were able to watch history in the making as the Chilean miners were rescued--an inspiring way to spend that stormy inside-day. 7) The food... well, if I had never been to any other all-inclusive, I would probably say it was great--but I know better. It was not 'great,' but it was good, and probably worth what we paid. The beauty is that someone else cooks it, someone else cleans up after it, and it's there whenever I want it. What's to complain about? So, I guess I should tell you the few negatives we experienced at Coco Bay, if I'm going to give an honest review: 1) The hot tub is not hot. 2) The nightly entertainment is highly inappropriate for a family resort, but I have learned that that is the same wherever you go. However, our first evening's show was great, with traditional sets, costumes, and dance--very talented young people! And one other night they performed Mama Mia. But 2 out of 7 isn't really acceptable. 3) The servers in the restaurants, while friendly enough, are highly inefficient. If you want to eat at a clean table which has been set properly for guests, don't be late to dinner. 4) Gym? What gym? 5) If you want to do any excursions, find a resort that's closer to what you want to see/do.

I recommend using all four of your available reservations because the italian and mexican restaurants were incredible. The snack bar was quite convenient especially for someone like me with a picky stomach, lot's of \"safe\" foods made to order. The lobby bar was understaffed in the evening but since we spent most of our nights out the best place to get our drinks fast was the \"disco-tec\" which we didn't know was there til a couple days into our stay, it was pretty much dead all the time but we used that to our advantage and spent a lot of time with our own personal bartender who was very very good. The housekeepers were incredible and the rooms were always very clean; we never had any trouble with waterbottles, (we had two from the airport and the two that came in the room so we just refilled those and left them in our fridge) the tap water is apparently drinkable but we didnt take the chance.

After arriving in Cancun there is a bit of a bus ride to get to Playa del Carmen but Grand Coco Bay is the first stop to arrive and leaving it is the last pickup so you get the most beach time. Staff a friendly and service is very good. Rooms are clean but the walls are thin, bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Great beach and safe for swimming, beautiful sun rise in the morning. Recommended for all ages. Location is close to 5th Ave within a 5 minute walk that is safe with good lighting at night. Entertaining and good places to eat. Lots of shops but prices are pretty high, don't pay more than half of what they want. Excurstions to Xcaret, Xplor, and Dolphinarus is would highly recommend. Xcaret and Xlpor I would book through your agent and take the tour bus there to get some info and your passes but catch a taxi back for $15, this will save yourself a lot of time. Dolphinaris was awsome. Staff were great and very repectful with the dolphins. A little expensive to buy photos (optional) but worth the expense for the experience. we also went to Coba to see the Mayan ruins. The tour is a long day and a lot of time is spent on the bus but worth the day trip to break up the week. Mayan village was worth the stop.

There are boats parked in front of the hotel but they don't move and didn't disturb us at all plus if you walk literally 2 mins in either direction there are no boats. The service was awesome, never waited more then a minute for drinks and always walked right into the buffet. The buffet food was alright, food was the only area this resort was lacking but it was decent.. The rooms were very nice, they give u a remote for the tv at check in, the maid and towel guy come every day, but they only fill up your fridge once at the beginning.. However the store in the lobby sells snacks and drinks for very reasonable prices (1.00 for a can of pop etc). We went on this excursion where u atv thru the jungle for an hour then swim through the cenote for 65 dollars each offered thru the diving shop and it was the best excursion ive ever been on.. Also tulum was okay, not really my type of excursion I like more adventurous stuff but it was j treating.. Lastly if \"Porfivio the Mexican Picasso\" comes to the resort while your there making intense paintings with only spray paint for 20 dollars make sure u check it out, he painted us swimming in the cenote and it was beautiful, most talent I've ever seen.. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone unless u need the 5 star attention because this is def not 4-5 star.. But it did the job and I had an awesome time in Mexico and I'm not broke, I might even go back to the same hotel in January again since it's so cheap.

Don't miss the Mexican Fiesta night, they really do a great job with the show and food and staff are doing their best to make you feel welcome. Many people from Quebec, Canada visit this hotel complex. The entertainment staff were fun and not too loud, never felt pushed, and they work hard. In general the staff here seem happy to be working at GCB, and a smile, tip and being courteous goes a long way. Great family resort, the evening shows were not extremely vulgar as many other places we have been to. We would have liked the spa (3 pools) to be heated as they were chilly.

It is not a 4-5 star hotel, but if you are budget conscious it serves the purpose. The staff at the front desk area is very helpful and go out of their way to accommodate you. The room was very clean, except the beds were very hard, be prepared.... it is not a Hilton Hotel bed!! . The maid service was exceptional, the girls gave you what you needed. (speak very little English) In the morning..... the staff was hard at work around the complex , sweeping, mopping and grooming the grass. The buffet had great food and as did the Italian and Mexican restaurants. You must make reservation for both the Italian and Mexican every morning at the buffet. I did not find this a problem, as this procedure is also followed on cruise ships. I had no problem with the pool bar, great drinks and the snack bar items were delicious. Again....this is not a 4-5 star hotel but who cares !!!! I was in Mexico and enjoyed Playa del Carmen with my two 40 some-thing girl friends !!! The all-inclusive price of approx $70.00 per night each was a good deal!!!, we did not go home broke !!! As in most hotels .........be wary of the time share men at the airport and hotel lobby........ just keep walking when the word senorita come out of their mouths !!! There are many things to do and places to explore in the area, I recommend ; zip lining, snorkeling, the Mayan Ruins in Tulum , Cozumel and shopping .......some Mayan Ruins are 2 hours away so be prepared , if you are strapped for time, Tulum is the closest. Cozumel can be visited , on your own, via the ferry, but zip lining and snorkeling must be set up via the tour office in the hotel. The tours can be expensive , but well worth the price. They leave early in the morning and you are back in the mid afternoon. I would recommend 2 tours in one day, so you have the next day to yourself by the pool. If you are looking for night life in the hotel..... there is very little, the disco was ok but I was so tired every nite it did not matter !!!! we had a few drinks at the lobby bar walked on the beach and called it a night. If you are looking for a great massage...........walk down the beach and look for the white tent, $25.00 for 30 minutes, a great deal!!!! In Conclusion.....

We are all in our late 20's, early 30's. We have been to 3, 4, & 5 star resorts in Mexico before. Grand Coco bay is a nice little resort, but I definatly wouldn't rate it as a 4 star. The resort is very pretty and the beach is great! When we got there, right away I noticed that it's definatly not a flashy or really fancy resort. The lobby is quite plain, and the rooms aren't very good at all. The beds are really hard, and this was the first resort we had ever been to that had an actual bath tub in the washroom! All the other resorts have had really nice big, luxurious showers. The patios are big and have a hammock on each one, which was nice. We did notice that a lot of the rooms were empty and when looking outside we saw caution tape on some of them because the patio's were starting to crumble. If you go here, make sure you get a room away from the lobby if you don't stay up late, because it seems to be the place to party! There is a disco in the resort that is open until 2am. We went to the disco a couple times, but it was always dead. The buffett restauant is just alright. The buffett is not very big, and the food is average. The Itialian restaurant is amazing (suggest the cream of spinach soup), The Mexican restaurant is not so good (which was very suprising). The staff at the resort are friendly, but they are not willing to go out of their way to make sure you have a good time. We have noticed at other resorts, the staff are very interactive, and the bar staff will do \"cocktail\" moves. At this resort it was just normal service, nothing special. The pool is really nice, and big, but cold! On the website, they say the pool closes at 10pm, but they kindof just decide each day when they want the pool closed. One day we even saw the staff kicking people out and saying the pool was closed at 6pm! They also do not allow you to swim in the ocean once the pool is closed. One really nice thing about the resort is the location. It only takes about 10 minutes to walk to 5th ave in Playa Del Carmen. The nigh shows at the resort were short and not very impressive. The spa is quite expensive, but very nice looking. We got a really good price on this resort, and if you can find a price for around $1500.00 for 10 days, I would recommend it. Anything more, you can stay at a much nicer place for the same price. I would rate this resort as a 3 star.

Just a step away from the beach that there is no worry if you forget something or want to go back to the room for something.

There is a lot of beach on either side of the hotel for walking, however, in a lot of areas the beach is somewhat narrow. The hotel pictures show a larger beach area than it was - however, with ever changing weather and water levels the beaches can easily change. This resort has 2 levels of beach area - one is at the level of the resort and the other is about 4-5 steps down and closest to the ocean. We felt that the lower beach area was pretty crowded. There are no resorts on either side of the hotel, however, this is a bar/restaurant on one side that is pretty low key and is not bothersome. There are a number of boats parked in the water in front of the hotel - whcih didn't bother us or smell of gas all day. We did however, notice a terrible smell at times when we went into the ocean to cool off - it was like rotten eggs or something. The room was average. The bed was fine however, the pillows are horrible! The cleaning staff did a great job every day. There is a fridge and you are supplied 4 cans of pop and 2 bottled water. Keep the empty water bottles and refill them at any of the bars or the front lobby. This is good for the environment!!!! We never had a problem with our A/C, and the shower water was pretty good - would become luke warm but warm up again in a few minutes again - but never went cold. There is a nice flat screen TV in the room, however, the cable went out quite a bit which was a little annoying at night when you were wanting to catch the news before bed or when it was pouring rain out and nothing much to do.... It costs $2.50 US for 30 minutes for internet which is not a huge cost - however only 1 of the 3 computers were working. NOTE: use common courtesy when you see others waiting in line to use the computer - a quick email home to check in should be sufficient!!! All staff were friendly - Carmelita was always happy and had a smile on her face each morning while she made your waffles, eggs or omelettes!!! Buffet- Breakfast and lunch were pretty good - meaning you could always find something to eat, however, the dinner buffet did not have a great selection. We ate at the Italian and Mexican restaraunts twice each and they were great! From noon - 6 pm you can get a burger (very thin patty so you may want a double!!), hotdog, individual pizza, sandwiches, fries or nachos with cheese and/or salsa. The bar staff could use a hand - most of the time there is only one person working the bar so be patient - this is not their fault - management should be doing something to address this. We took in only one of the shows - Mama Mia. It was just ok. The other shows did not interest us. Overall, we would not likely return to this resort.

After reading some of the negative reviews we were a little nervous, but it turned out to be one of our best vacations. The room -- we lucked out with a room on the ground floor, with a patio that was steps away from the pool. All of the rooms overlook the pool area, so I don't think you could get a bad room location, but for us, ground floor was ideal. The fridge in our room made a horrible rattling sound. By the end of the stay our AC didn't seem to be cooling the room very well. The pool - amazing! It's huge with a kiddie pool on one end, a swim up bar and a volleyball net on the far end. I noticed some people commented that you couldn't get service at the swim up bar. That was not our experience at all. There were regularly people in the pool getting served. Service - the bars and snack food service area are understaffed, but it's not a big deal. I never waited more than a minute or two for a drink. There is not wait staff to serve at the pool or beach, so be prepared to go get your drinks. The beach - plenty of chairs and shade. The boat parking lot is kind of interesting and definitely doesn't get in the way of any water activities. Diving - my husband went on three dive trips. The female dive master in the dive shop is very friendly and helpful. We got 25% off the listed prices; I think this is common practice, so be prepared to pay LESS! If you do dive, know that the 2 tank dive is coordinated with other resorts and it takes a long time to get to and from. They take you out by boat, but drop you at another resort and bus you back. Kid friendly - there wasn't an abundance of things for my daughter to do, but she still had fun. The kiddie pool is perfect for young ones and there is a playground set near the beach area. We were provided a baby bed; it was pretty crappy, but got the job done. Food - since we had a toddler with us we didn't eat at the reservations only restaurants. The cafeteria, Miramar, was okay. For some meal the food was great, others were very lacking. I agree with the review that Oriental night is no good. The drinks were very good, they definitely don't skip on the alcohol! The spa - we had issues with the spa staff not speaking English. After having a very frustrating time trying to make a reservation we showed up and found that our reservation had been booked incorrectly. We were flexible about it and the massage was wonderful! Transportation - it sounds like most people book a package that comes with transportation to and from the airport. We book directly with the hotel and had to coordinate our own transportation. We used www.cancunshuttle.com -- and they were awesome! Our flight was 2.5 hours late and they were still waiting for us. We had to be picked up at 2:50 am for our early flight and they were right on time. I highly recommend this company.

We arrived early Saturday morning 2:00am, check in was quick, got into our room quickly and everything was smooth! We even made it to the sports bar for a cerveza! The \"Welcome Meeting\" the next morning was informative, but we chose to book an excursion with the travel agent in the lobby, (great guy) we saved $50/person but had to take a cab to Xcaret... not too bad for $12. The Ocean is amazing, after reading previous reviews we knew going there about the so called \"Boat Parking Lot\" it's not so bad.... yes there are boats there but it doesn't ruin the view or the beautiful ocean in anyway. We heard the boat owners signed a contract long before the hotel was built, so really... not there fault and it doesn't wreck the resort in anyway. The Pool is okay, don't expect service at your chair though... you do have to get up to get your own beverages, the music at the pool could use improvement... more variety for all ages would be an improvement. The Lunch Shack, great place the food is good... Roast Beef Sandwich was a family favorite! The Buffet, breakfast was always good... disappointed with the bacon, but in general the breakfast was good! Can't tell you about the lunch buffet, as we chose to eat at the lunch shack. Supper was good... if you were there early! The supper starts at 6:30 and if you wait until 8ish, it's pretty picked over. A la Cartes, they were both fantastic Mexican and Itallian both great dinners. The resort is in a great location, either a 20 minute walk on the beach or a $5 cab ride to 5th Avenue. The Service, unfortunatley I can't say a whole lot about the service we received. The line ups for the bars were generally long. The staff are not overly friendly, generally we hear the workers singing and greeting people at other resorts, but not this one... and I don't think it is the fault of the staff. In my opinion, the staff at this resort are overworked, there is generally only 1 bartender at each bar, only 2 cooks that also serve at the lunch shack, a huge section for the waiters and waitresses to cover in the buffet area. Generally at resorts you will see the maids cleaning around the major walk ways. Not here... actually I don't think I ever saw a maid outside... I'm thinking they only do the rooms. The rooms are spotless, very clean and never had an issue with AC or hot water. I regret to inform you, the rep at the resort with Sunwing was a fantastic guy in the beginning, once we asked him for his assistance in a late check out (checkout was 12:00 noon, and out flight wasn't until 1:40am) he was not so friendly, he said there was nothing he could do to help us with a late check out, the maids only work until 5. This was very disappointing, we actually had to argue with the front desk to get out checkout extended to 3:00pm. Once we got all this settled, without the assistance of our Sunwing rep, he did not return to talk to us at all that day... which was odd, he was generally a friendly guy and always greeted us during the day. It was like, we asked him for assistance, and he suddenly turned. Not impressed at all, with that! Upon reading my review, please keep in mind we have travelled to the Dominican twice, Puerto Vallarta twice, Cuba, Los Cabos, and this was our second trip the Mayan. I do think this resort is okay... if you get a good deal you have nothing to loose. It is definitley not a 4.5 star, maybe 3 or 3.5. The food is good, the service needs some serious improvement. The beach is great, the pool is okay and the location is perfect. To sum it up, a vacation is what you make of it.. we had a great time, the weather was amazing!!

If we wanted anything more during the week, it was going to be an additional cost. That being said, we had to hide our empty water bottles in the fridge each day so the maid would not toss the bottles and had to refill ourselves in the cafeteria/buffet. We were also told by Lomas Travel that room service was available but only between the hours of 10pm - 1am.

We didn't have a remote for the tv, there wasn't a coffee maker or a clock in the room. This was the same for our entire party (5 rooms). The public restrooms were not clean. I'm not sure what it was, but the smell was like they had not been cleaned for a week. One toilet in the woman's restroom by the pool didn't have a seat! I felt like the staff was overworked and couldn't cater to the wants of customers. Only one bar was open at the resort at a time. There were no cocktail waitresses so forget trying to get a drink at the beach. The one bar open for the significant part of the day was staffed with 2 employees. The Lomas agent was pretty good but gave some misconceived information for the golf outing. FYI - The \"twilight\" session is cheaper because you aren't guaranteed 18 holes of golf. They sell it as 18 holes but that is only if you can play fast enough before they close. The grounds were well maintained and security was apparent.

This hotel is so far removed from 4 1/2 star hotel it's not funny. I was put off as soon as I walked into the main lobby. Had to pay $3.00 american per day for use of the safe, want your mini bar re-stocked(consisted of 4 pop) no problem, that too is another charge.It took forever to get booked into our room, boy was I blown back when I walked into the room, beds were small, hard and really not what I imagined in a 4 1/2 star. After all I have stayed at the Princess and the Palladium several times, which are rated only 1/2 star more. The rooms were below average, cleaning staff needs some more training, toilets were running constantly or were backed up. Need a drink at the lobby bar or the pool bar, hope you got time, even when they are not busy it can take 30 minutes to get someone to notice you and serve you, better order a couple at a time. Staff rarely smiles when you do see them, I suspect it is because they are over worked and under payed, they desperately need to hire more staff. The pool guy who does aroebics, is also your towel guy, who is also the karaoke guy, the beach guy, the waiter in the buffet and in his spare time he is the announcer for your evening show, he gets 1/2 a day off a week and he was the only guy I seen smiling. Hats off to Allan!! The food where to begin, the food in the a la cartes amazing, I have to say I am stunned that the food from the buffet comes from the same kitchen. /all the meat is covered in sauces, so you are not really sure what you are eating. We did see a schnauzer running around the night before, maybe he was the unlucky hor derves. Fresh veggies consisted of lettuce leaves, tomatoe slices and cucumber slices I am sure that came from the day before. Sure hope you are not a vegetarian, everything is covered or deep fried, Bon Appetite. I usually go home and have to lose 5 lbs, not this time I actually dropped a couple(and no I am not 300 lbs)Trust me the last thing I need to lose is weight. The swimming pool is closed for kids at 7 pm, and you guessed it, no kids club, like the hotel so clearly advertises. My 12 year old daughter got permission to go into the karaoke bar to sing, she was there with her 4 other family members, we had no drinks on our table and there were 4 staff in the room and 2 other couples. A manager walked up to me and said, \"you need to leave and take your kid with you\" I said she had permission to be there he said she can't because of the alcohol. Remembering we are at an all inclusive, I said to him there is alcohol everywhere, the pool, the beach, the lobby where would you like her to go, she can't swim you won't allow that. I think they need to make this hotel aduly only, kids are not really welcome here. The concierge/time share dude books your excursions, do not get your hopes up. We also booked that trip to Chichen Itza with the other couple Kat and Bert, the only good thing out of that trip is we made some new friends, we got to go to Chichen Itza for a whole 1 1/2 hours with our bilingual tour guide, half the time we were standing and waiting and never got to see the old part and only about 1/2 of the front pyramid section. So when we all complained to David the concierge/timeshare dude he made it up to us. For a mere $90.00 american 3 of us could go to Coba and climb the pyramid before they close it in December. We were going for a half day.Coba and only Coba here we come. WRONG!! They took us to a cenote, okay that's only 1 hour, they then dumped us at a private beach that cost us $20.00 american, when he came back, I explained we paid to go to Coba and are to be back at the hotel by 2 pm. He said impossible, we are going to a village, then shopping, then lunch and Coba after that, I told him I wanted my money back he said no and left us at the beach, it cost us $40.00 american to get back to hotel, except are driver would not take us to the hotel he dumped us at the ferry and we had to walk back. David did refund us the $90.00 american, but did not help with the cab fare or beach fare. I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy, stay clear.

First off the location was horrible. extremely far walk to the heart of \"5th Avenue\" with all the shops and cute little town (which was extremely enjoyable and pleasant, overpriced but that is to be expected). However you can taxi anywhere for 40 pesos (4$ can) during the day and 70 pesos (7$ can) at night. The Staff was reasonable but didnt have a clue what was going on, we wanted to rent a scooter and the front desk acted as if i asked to rent a space ship. The bar was busy at night and only had one bartender and i waited forever for a drink even when i was tipping. No service at the bar UNLESS you are tipping. Some of the staff are smiling and some seem to be upset or tired or angry. The buffet staff is slow with drinks and not very friendly. THE SECURITY made us feel like we were CRIMINALS.. always causing trouble and always gave us dirty looks and harassed us, when we wanted to go for an evening swim we werent allowed, the pool closes at 10?! We wanted to take a dip in the ocean at dusk and weren't allowed. TOO MANY RULES for a vacation. Too much patrolling, i felt like i was 12 and on vacation with my parents. The Rooms were so so, it took us bargaining and negotiating for at least 45 minutes to get a room with a king sized bed with an ocean view. When we booked we were promised that. When Alfonso FINALLY gave us what we wanted we had to wait for 6 hours before we could have it and left our luggage in a room. The bed was hard but again for some reason we had no troubles falling asleep. The air conditioning was good and cold! The toilets in everyones rooms seemed to be broken, ours wouldnt flush and always seemed to have problems. The TV had no remote and other travelers had these same problems. The tv channels didnt even work. when the tv was turned on manually. The cleaning staff sucked and really didnt clean the way any other hotel i've stayed in. They actually stole something as well. The food was mediocre, Sometimes it tasted fresh, sometimes it was soggy and flavourless. I was unimpressed. The \"A La Cart Restuarant\" was always apparently booked and you had to book before 11am and when we tried to see if we could squeeze in, IT WAS EMPTY!! we even waited with some drink for 2 hours to see if it ever got busy and it never did. The house wine was HORRIBLE!, the drinks were always served in plastic cups and THE ODD glass that we got we werent allowed to leave the bar area with. NO ROOM SERVICE??!! The music being played throughout the day sucked and seemed like it was mexican radio, which is fine for a bit, but i want some variety. There is a saying, you cant please all the people all the time, but you try to please some of the people some of the time. NO ONE WAS PLEASED with the music. Even the event staff doing pool events or areobics, were nice, but were slacking and or not professional about their job, they didnt know how to entertain people and brought their own children to work and THE GUESTS were looking after them!!! The Lobby was boring, no music, the BAR OPENED at 6pm CLOSED AT 12 midnight. Then the \"sports\" bar closed at 2am meaning the hotel completely stopped serving drinks at 2, The Snack bar actually had some good selection but wasnt consistent and needed more than just one person running it. The beach was decent with clear sand and water, but there was a parking lot for boats right infront which was a very unpleasant view, they could have parked somewhere else. THE NON MOTORIZED WATER TOYS (canoe, kayake, windsurf, catamaran, sail boat, snorkeling gear) were NOT free!! the sea doo's were $120 american an hour and cannot be negotiated. The kayake and canoe were $40 american an hour, the sail boats and windsurfs were $60 american) THIS HOTEL NEEDS TO HIRE MORE STAFF TO HELP!!!! not enough staff for any area!!and the ones they have need to smile. THIS HOTEL HAS ALOT OF FALSE ADVERTISING AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A clean 2 star hotel and nothing more.

It can get a little noisy by the pool, so if you dont like noise spend a little extra to get an oceanview or save with a garden view. We went during an off season, so they understandably cut back on the bar staff. One bartender handled the swim up bar and the poolside bar which made a line for the drinks at almost any moment. The food was average. Nothing really stood out as amazing. the snack bar had cheese quesadillas and tostadas as their only Mexican option. The buffet dinner changed everyday, but it also lacked a good selection of Mexican style dishes. The upstairs resaurant filled up quick, I recommend reserving your spot before 9. There is a dress code that isnt very well stated before you get there, so pack something nice to wear to it. Shopping at 5th avenue is not super close. it takes at least 20 minutes walking at a brisk pace to get there. In the hot mexican sun it feels much longer. Many shops do not have AC. Once you have hit your first big tourist shop, you are pretty much done, they all have the same things. Recommended drinks would be the Riviera Maya dn the Tequila sunrise.

I will agree with the other reviewers that the hotel manager is a chicken. We booked our stay for 5 people and 2 decided to join. When we called to try and add the 2 extra people they told us to do so when we got there. We paid $50pp each night and was promised the price would be the same. When we got there, the price went up to $90pp. We didn't pay it, waited until the next morning and asked for the manager. He would come out to talk to us, but sent us a girl that barely spoke english to negotiate with us. It was pathetic. We managed to pay $60pp instead of the inflated rate of $50. Other than that, the hotel was ok. Rooms clean, a/c ok, beds hard as a rock, hot water good, water pressure ok, food ....mediocre. Staff (other than the manager) friendly. Victor spoke very good english and was nice. This is NOT a 4 star hotel by any means of US standards. I would put it at a 2-2.5 stars. I have stayed at many other places and this place is great for the price, but not 4 stars. My only complaint other than the manager, would be that where this hotel is located there is NO wind coming off of the ocean. So the eating areas are stale and HOT. I didn't spend much time on the beach because of this. However, the swimming is great on the beach because there are little to no waves. So, my advice is. If you need somewhere cheap to stay that is decent, then this is a good spot. If you are going to luxury, most definitely go somewhere else.

This hotel was clean and the service was great. I guess those who blatantly rate it lower are just trying to make the hotel look bad. One bad experience can't under rate everything about a hotel. SERVICE No problems. Smooth check in. Staff dealt with issues quickly and efficiently. Bar and wait staff worked hard to make you feel welcome. I asked to be close to the water and the front desk complied because there was an available room. ROOMS Very clean. Typical room for hotel of this level. Everything worked. People need to remember that each room isn't individually controlled. There is a main system that cools to the temperature to a setting. It is very hard to keep everyone happy. If it is a bit cool...open your room sliding door a bit. Every room faces the pool area and has a balcony. FOOD Great food. Different menu each night in the buffet. The A La Carte restaurants were well done. Don't expect 5 star food quality at this level of hotel. Well done for the level of hotel. BEACH Cleaned everyday. Appeared to be enough shade for everyone. You can walk for about 3 kilometres to the north and it is somewhat deserted early in the morning. There is a local beach area at the end of the beach that has fresh water springs pumping out of the ground and then into the ocean. Interesting to see. It is quite safe to walk. South of the hotel you can walk along the beach into Playa Del Carmen. NIGHTLIFE You are right on the edge of Playa Del Carmen. About a 5-10 minute walk to the north end of 5th Avenue. If you want it is about a 5 dollar taxi ride to the south end. You get off at Plaza Antigua and then you can walk along 5th avenue towards the hotel. Lots of trendy restaurants and shops.

Had all kinds of exictement about going since I was going with 3 of my sisters. Got to the hotel to check in, They give you wine and wet towel to freshen you up while you wait for the sign in and bracelet, room keys, and towel cards. That went OK. All week we were there, we had issues with lights going off, air conditioning leaking, toilet backing up. TV not working. And if you told someone about it, somehow it was always your fault. Like leaving door open for the condensacion in room. We did not leave door open for the air conditioning to leak. For the most part the food in the Miramar restaurant was great. Different menus every day. Italian restaurant food was great. Did not try the Mexican Restaurant. Seems there was a lot of families there with children. Families that didn't seem to follow rules, like NO food in pool area, no climbing on the concrete pillars in pool area, no getting in Jacuzzie if you were under 18. For the most part, most of the workers, staff and the entertainment were great. There were a few bad apples in the bunch. Like the guy serving drinks in the pool area, and the guys serving food in the snack area. I asked one guy for chicken wings, and he basically just walked away from me and went behind the grill like I wasn't even there. RUDE!!! It seems to me if this place is in business, they would want to take care of problems that come up and not blame the guests for their problems that need fixing. I left yesterday afternoon. which was 8/4/2010/ When I woke up big puddle on floor had to put waste basket to catch the drip coming out of the light fixture above the door. came back from breakfast, another leak coming from air vent. Toilet backed up also. Told front desk on way back from breakfast. Said someone was going to come to check out. But since I was checking out then, could I leave early, because they had a lot of people coming. They were busy. Went over to my sisters room and stayed there for an hour or so before going to lobby.

Check-in was a breeze, which was great, cause we were exhausted after travelling with a baby. The lobby is nice and quaint, but has poor air circulation. So we arrived to our room, soo tired, and ready to freshen up so we could grab something to eat. This is where it began. I started to run a bath for our baby, and the stopper for the tub was broken. We called the front desk who sent someone to fix it. Got my baby bathed, then proceded to take a shower, but the shower did not work. Along this process I noticed the bathroom door did not shut. All you had to do was push it open, the latch would not click. So my daughter was in the bathroom, non stop. Anybody with a 15 month old knows what I am talking about (hand swishing in the toilet the minute you take your eyes away). So I told my husband that I am not fishing my daughters hands out of the toilet our whole holiday and that we need a new room. So we ended up changing rooms..Only after I had unpacked, just to pack up again. The room we got moved to was better, everything we needed. I will tell you that the rooms are basic, no frills. If you want a remote control for the TV, you will have to get it from the front desk, and it will have to be taken back to the front dest to be reset almost daily in order for it to work. One other complaint I have is that the bathrooms have no fan..Absolutely no air circulation. I have travelled Mexico extensively, so I knew what to expect. The rest of our trip was fantastic. This resort has everything you need. Beautiful beach, great pool and grounds and the food is fantastic. Lots of variety, even if you are picky. We do not eat pork and there was always something . There is fruit, cereal, the yogurt is excellent and we always brought a couple to our room for our baby to have when she woke from her naps. I always enjoyed the eggs and refried beans. The staff was great, always had a smile and hello for our baby. Especially Guadaloupe, whe gave us 1 litre of milk whenever we needed to take to our room for our baby. The last night of our stay, our baby got sick and threw up all over our bedding(not from the food, she just drank too much milk), the front desk sent someone right away and had our bedding switched over in no time..(considering this was at 11:00 in the night). This resort is very family friendly, and is small which makes easy for getting around. I would have to say that this is an economical resort, and don't pay more than $1000.00 for your vacation here. The only problems that we encountered were due to the poor maintenence of the rooms. We still enjoyed ourselves, and had fun in the sun daily, and walked to town every night to spend our evenings. I would say if you get a good deal, take it..Who spends time in your room the whole vacation anyways. Another tip..The air conditioner in the rooms is set to turn off after a few hours (due to guests leaving them on non stop). So what we do is turn it off when you leave, and then turn it on when you get in the room. It will not take long for the room to cool down..Oh yeah and keep your water bottles and refill them at breakfast at the water coolers in the restaurant..Then you have water for the day...EASY routine to get into..

I was a little surprised when she said that there would be a $3/day rental charge for the safe. But nonetheless I agree and offered up my credit card for incidentals, she said it was not necessary that we would settle up at checkout (remember this, it becomes very important later). This took about 20-25 mins to get checked in, towel cards issued and arm bands put on. All in all the check in process was quick and painless for me....but my kids (ages 5 and 7, first trip to Mexico) were having fit to get into their swim suits and get in the pool . The \"changing room\" was the lobby's public restroom, that was under construction and not available. So we were instructed to use the pool side public restroom. We went to the restroom and it was naturally wet and seem unsanitary so we asked for our towels (remember the towel cards at check in). They staff informed us that they were out of towels, so we went back to the front desk and were again met with friendly enough people but they were not able to offer any solutions to our problems. So we went back to the pool and my kids just swam in their travel clothes for a while. We then went back to the front desk to check on our rooms (11:00) and we got in some trouble for tracking in water....remember we had no towels! We finally decide to dig in our luggage and dry the kids off with my shirt and let them change in the luggage closet...we got in trouble for that as well. We went back to the pool and the wife and i sat at the swim up bar to get a drink to calm the nerves while the kids swam...and we sat....and we sat....and we sat....and we sat....not a drink between the two of us....there is very little service at the swim up bar! So the nerves are still a little bit on edge. Around 2:00 we were assigned our room (2428)...we had a top floor room with an amazing view of palm tree!! Seriously you couldn't see past the tree! We could see and hear the pool and the ocean we just couldn't see them. We finally settled in and began to realize that our room was warm/hot and didn't seem to getting any cooler...we did figure out the secret is to keep the closet doors closed, the bathroom doors closed and the curtains drawn...all day and night...and that seemed to make it bearable...just not comfortable...especially in the bathroom. And before i forget be sure and go see Carlos (if you travel with Lomis Travel). he will chew you out if you don't...I know this from experience...and that is what you want while you are on vacation is a butt chewing from our travel rep. Day 2: All day at the pool....friendly pool/entertainment staff...nothing exciting. Day 3: I took the wife and kids to Xcaret for the day...too hot and too much walking for me and my team...you can decide for yourself ($207 USD for the 4 of us). We stopped back at the hotel grabbed a quick shower and head back to town for dinner (since the food at the hotel is not that good). We returned to the hotel at around 11:00 in the evening and began our routine of showers, teeth brushing and taking medicine when we noticed that staff had not replaced bottled in the frig. This was strange since we were at an all inclusive resort. I decided to go to the front desk and just get one there (thinking it would be 30second deal). I informed Salvador that the staff had not restocked our frig asked if i could get a bottle of water...he informed me that only the first day's water was free and any additional water or soft drinks were $2.50 each. I told him that there must be a mistake that we had paid for and \"all inclusive\" package and he assured me that i was not entitled to any free water and if i wanted a bottle of water that i would have to pay for it. I said whatever and offered to let him just charge it to my room. He said that since i did not have a credit card on file that he would not be able to give me bottle of water (remember the credit card at the beginning of the story)? I told him that i did not have any cash or credit cards on my person (since i had showered and changed in my PJ's) that they were in my room and he could just make a note and i would settle up with them at check out tomorrow (like i was going to do with the safe)...he told me to go to my room and get some form of payment he would be glad to sell me bottle of water...I told him to get me a [-] bottle of water...he told me to go get him some money and he would give me water....I all gets a little fuzzy here but i do recall telling him to go [--] himself and get me my [--] water.....and he then called security....and that's where it got ugly!!! (a full incident report in on file at the front desk if you choose to inquire about it). I will say that if it weren't for a kind professional employee named Victor who was witness to the debacle and who brought me a bottle of water to my room. If if werent for Victor then i would have most likely spent time in the Mexican jail. All this over a bottle of water!!! FYI this is my 9th time to Mexico (5 Cozumel, 3 Playa Del Carmen, 1 Cancun) and i can say that this is not the norm for customer service in Mexico.

Reservations to either the Mexican or Italian are done between 7 and 11 am at breakfast. There is a swim-up bar but do not expect to get served while in the water. Usually two bar tenders work and it is only on the top part. Most of the time there is only one bar open and it sometimes takes a while getting drinks but the bartenders work hard and do a super job getting everyone served. We took insulated cups with us (not large tankards) and if you saw the way glasses are washed everyone would do the same. This is the practice at most bars everywhere. Towel service could be a problem at times with kids in charge of the service. We found few Americans there when we went, many French Canadians, and a lot of Spanish speakers so we did not meet as many people as we usually do. The area of town this resort is in is not the best. It is much more than a mile to town but a cab ride is only $5. We did enjoy the beach route to town a couple of times. It is longer but it is a cooler safer walk.

First and foremost, the staff is hounding you 27/7!! The maids never knock, they just let themselves in...constantly! We had a maid walking into our room, no word of a lie, at least 2-3 times a day. You constantly feel like you're being watched by the staff. Security randomly knocks on your door and just looks in your room, and leaves. This may sound like they're checking for safety reasons, but there is a very uneasy \"Big Brother\" feeling when they're around. I heard the same complaint from several other travelers who we met during our stay. We had a scary encounter with one of the men at the resort when we called him to look at our air conditioner. Long story short, the man was fired and we spent our second day at the police station making statements. I felt very unsafe at this resort during my entire stay. Next, the staff rip you off consistently. No tip is ever good enough for any of the staff members. Particularly, a bartender named Gilberto...watch out for him he's very choosy with who he like and who he doesn't...and if he doesn't like you...go to a different bar tender because your service from him will be awful. If you listen to anything from this review listen to this: Don't, and I repeat, Don't go anywhere with the entertainment staff!! Book through the guest services manager or Carlos the excursion guy. Everytime we went somewhere with entertainment staff, they'd rip us off. Coco Bongo for example, is ALWAYS a different price depending on who takes you. One Thursday we went it was $600 pesos. The next Thursday the same guy said $625, then 2 hours later it was $650!! Then at the end of the night they end up sending a different staff member to take us to Coco Bongo, and he said $690!!!! They just make up what ever price they feel like, and once they realize that your catching on to their scam, they ignore you and move on to knew guests that they can blindside. They always say taxi is included there and back, don't believe it. They took a bunch of us out, then left without saying a word, and we all had to pay for cabs back to the hotel. The food is okay, but to be honest the snack bar 4/5 times is better then the buffet. The Italian and Mexican restaurants are alright but nothing more than mediocre. If you plan on having a romantic or quiet vacation, don't go here!! There are a million Spanish children running around all the time, and they don't speak English, so you can't tell them to stop splashing while they're jumping into the pool practically inside your drink. Their were several nights while we were there our water stopped working in our room, there was bugs everywhere, our TV regularly stopped working, the toilet barely flushed and the air conditioner leaked almost everyday, and one time, flooded the floor and soaked my luggage. Again, if you want peace and quiet, better not get a room by the lobby, there were several nights where the music was pounding until 2am. The bar is also right there, so you can hear people shouting and talking, and the blender going off every 5 minutes. To end this review, I want to say that I NEVER complain, I travel the Caribbean 3 times a year and I have never had to write a bad review until I stayed at Grand Coco Bay. Please just don't stay at this hotel, it will ruin your vacation. Lastly, parents, don't EVER let your teenagers travel here alone, especially if they're young girls.

Me and a best girlfriend went. First off, it was a fairly quick commute from the airport (about 45 minutes). Check in was a breeze, be prepared to pay I believe it was $3.00 a day to use the safe in the room ( definately pay!). Our room was nice, the beds were comfortable and the washroom was clean. Do not be expecting a glamorous room, it provides the bare necessities, which was just fine for us! I should mention, we had planned to book last minute for our vacation, thinking it would be cheaper, and we kind of got screwed. We ended up paying $1450 canadian for a week at this all inclusive resort. Let me be honest here, I would not pay more than $1000 MAX to stay here. Anyways, the resort is small, which i liked, it was easy to get around. The beach is wonderful, and there is always a lounger available. The food is fine, no real complaints, a little bland if anything ( bring hot sauce!) lots of variety in the buffets. A la Cartes are good, the Mexican restaurant definately wins over the Italian hands down! The entertainment staff are absolutely wonderful! So funny and so friendly! I recommend playing ping pong and vollyball with them, you will have a blast! While on the trip we experienced one solid day of rain in which we decided to visit the spa. I had a massage and a facial and it was heavenly. My friend had a massage and a body exfoliation and loved it., The spa is very quiet, very modern and spotless. I highly recommend. The location of the resort is perfect. very close to Fifth Avenue for shopping ( set lots of time aside, Fifth Ave is HUGE! I recommend going in the evening as it gets very very very hot there!). As far as things to do on your vacation, we did the \"Tulum Extreme Adventure\" tour which included a tour of the tulum ruins, ziplining, repelling, and swimming in an undergrond cenote, I highly reccomend this trip, it was around $100 american and worth every penny!So so SOOOO fun! Guides are awesome. If you want a night to party, definantely go to COCO BONGO, is a nutshell, it is absolutely insane! basicallly a huge party with celebrity impersonators, a real vegas style show, so fun! Take advantage of any tour for snorkeling, snorkeling in the reef is absolutely amazing. One thing I want to add is that there is NO nightlife in this resort, and i mean none. The disco says 18+ but there were basically 30 children and their parents dancing around. This is really a resort for families. We still had a blast, but wished there was something to do after 9 o clock in the evening. We had a lot of earl ynights, basically, becuase we were bored. If you want to party a bit, I don't recommend staying here. UNless you go with the entertainment crew to the numerous bars, which can get expensive, it was $50 american to go to coco bongo, worth it, but pricey. If you have a family, or are early to bed and early risers, this is an amazing resort. I believe the actual website rates it a 4.5, honestly, i have been to mexico numerous times and i can fairly say it is a 3 star.

(exit hotel, turn left and go until you are at the T intersection where you turn right and then left at 5th avenue, don't walk on the beach, it is much longer). I can recommend to go all the way down the 5th avenue. If you need to buy anything there is a huge \"Mega\" store (we were buying fruits, yougurt,sunscreen etc.) and you can actually walk there. We also went to local market to buy fruits. You need a taxi to get there, say \"colosio market\". There are few things about this hotel that people need to know in advance, so they are not frustrated as we were first night. We arrived at about 10PM and there is nothing to eat or drink there (except champaigne) until 11PM, when the snack bar opens. Hotel staff was helpful though and found some food for us. There is also a gap in a \"food coverage\" during the day. The bedding is better than in other hotels we have been to.

I am a travel agent from PEI, Canada and travelled to this resort for a FAM trip through one of the Wholesales that I deal with to see how the resort was, I work for Expedia PEI Cruise Ship Centers! Great Agency. The only problem that I found with this resort is that if you call a package \"All Inclusive\" then you would think that they would stock your mini fridge! You were offered 2 complimentary bottled water and 4 cans of soda (and this is to be shared with your other guest in your room) And this is all they put in your fridge!! If you want anything else after this you have to pay for it $$ There is no liquor in your fridge at all! They tell you not to drink the water in your bathroom so if you need water in the early morning you have to go looking for it elsewhere if there is a bar open and if not then tough luck! The water on the resort is okay in the buffet area, they said it was filtered, but how would you know? The rep on the resort said it was okay to drink, I did drink it and I never got sick. We arrive late in the evening so there wasn't much open and our rooms where not even stocked with our complimentary water or soda. Called the front desk and they said they would bring them up, next morning nothing, called again twice and went to the desk twice, on the last visit to the desk I said that this is the 4 or 5th time I am asking for my complimentary water and soda and no one has brought them to my room so she finally got someone on the phone and they were there before I got back to my room. They log the calls in there book whenever a guest calls the front desk and it was showing there that I called so I don't know what the problem was!! I told her after a couple of days not having my bottled water that there better me no charge on my room, she said not it is complimentary, I said that it should be restocked every day with no charge \"all inclusive\" means no charge, but she said this is there policy! Most staff was very friendly and the place was very clean. Food was good, lots of choices Pool was nice and clean Entertainment was good Beach was very nice, it would have been nice to have the boats parked somewhere else, it kinda took away from the view, plus with them reving up the engines there was fumes around and it was busy right there on the water. You couldn't go snorkeling by yourself or you would get run over by a boat. The resort is almost right in the town of Playa Del Carmen, you can walk around the town no problem Place was very quiet in the evenings, didn't hear much noise The rooms were very nice, nothing to fancy but they kept them very clean Extra cost to use the safety deposit box 21 dollars per week Top floor (3rd floor) is not very safe, they are doing renovations now so hopefully will be all fixed soon Resort is small and cozy if this is what you like. Not much nightlife unless you left the resort to go to some of the downtown discos One note to make to anyone who needs to call home from here or mexico.. the best thing to do is buy your prepaid cards there, some prepaid cards you buy from home will not work there....Buy the ones from mexico, instructions on the cards are easier to follow than others. Overall for myself considering an all inclusive to meet most expectations of at least having bottled water (resocked daily) in the mini fridge I wouldn't recommend this resort for this reason only. Other than that the resort is small and cozy and nice. Does need more renovations to some other areas. Staff if friendly, and it is very clean. All depends on what you are looking for.

I like to see the differences in opinions of people..so I will give you my opinion after spending a week at Grand Coco Bay. I'll start by saying that I have been to many many all inclusive resorts. Very few stand out, and Coco Bay falls into this catagory. Nothing at all wrong with the place, actually it was quite nice..as I said in my title..a good solid 3 star..no more..no less. Check in was fine, fast and efficient. A welcome drink upon arrival as in many other places. The room was fine, and very clean..Had a balcony overlooking the pool, and you could see the ocean. It appears all the rooms overlook the pool area. The buffet restaurant was typical of all inclusives..always something to eat. Very nice desserts, and good service. As in any open air restaurant, there are bugs to be contended with, and some nights the mosquitos were terrible. The Italian restaurant was excellent. I went with 6 other people, on 3 different nights, and noone had a complaint about anything. The Mexican restaurant was not to our liking. Food had weird sauces, some that looked like, and were the colour of toothpaste. We only ate there 1 night. The grill alongside the pool was great for lunches, with a wide variety of choices. Drinks were fine. Had a massage for 55.00, and it was wonderful. ( If you book a couples massage, it is 55.00 opposed to 60.00 for a single..Just means you are both in the same room. Playa Del Carmen is close by and you can walk along the beach to get to it: however, the heat knocks you out. A cab ride is only 5.00. 5th Ave. is definitely a tourist trap, but we had lots of fun shopping, stopping for beer, and mingling with the locals. I love the Mexican silver as it doesn't tarnish..Bought a ring for 30.00, 1 pair of earrings for 30.00, and 1 pair for 22.00..T-shirts around the 10-12 dollar mark. Lots of fun. Xel-Ha ( my 3rd time there) is a great place to swim, snorkel, tube. We booked through the hotel at 99.00 (this week only..haha!) but the entrance fee is only 79.00 if you make your own way there and back. Includes all your equipment, lockers, towels, food, and drinks..Lots of paths to walk on and see beautiful wild-life. The beach was really nice for swiming, nice sandy bottom. Lots of boats out front, but they don't interfere with anything. We only saw one show there ( Michael Jackson) as the entertainment, in my opinion, at most resorts, is not quality..The M.J. show was very good though ( if you're a fan) All in all, it is a very nice little resort, nice staff, good rooms. We paid just over 1000.00 Canadian for this trip..and I will close by saying that I've had just as good, for a cheaper price. This hotel should be in the 800.00 range..but..you live and learn.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThree stars at best, very surprised and a bit disappointed\u201d", "Author": "natalie73", "ReviewID": "UR63055451", "Content": "This hotel has two things going for it. the staff who are wonderful and pleasant all the time and the cleanliness. Otherwise, I'd rate it at a 3 star at the most. typical \"motel style\" mexican rooms, old tv's chipped paint on the doors etc, stained taps, faded granite, but super clean. We were given two rooms off the bat that weren't ready, third one was super noisy until we were moved upstairs, still noisly but better. Mini bar not filled up in any of these rooms then not once in seven days. Asked that it be filled up and told go to the gift shop, it's cheaper. you get two waters ($2 each) upon arrival. do NOT throw out these water bottles because after that you simply CANNOT get another one unless you buy it yourself. what kind of 4+ star hotel can't get you a bottle of water?. after the bar closes your only option for water is to trudge down to the lobby for a tiny glass of room temperature water. Hotel was super noisy, lots of screaming, running, yelling after the nightclub closed at 2am. Toilets repeatedly on the fritz and not flushing, both got \"bad stomachs\" at one point and had to leave toilets full as they just dont fill up with water, so poor housekeeping had to deal with it. public pool area toilets smelled of urine and also stopped flushing often. Kids weren't a big problem until the weekend ( i think it might have been staff kids day or something?) but then the staff did nothing to move them to the activity pool because they were jumping, splashing and SCREAMING all day annoying all the adults trying to float and drink and relax. Food in the italian and mexican restaurant was excellent, but unless you eat those two over and over you are stuck with the cafeteria which makes the airplane food look good. not much choice and not well prepared. Didn't see a single kayak, windsurfer or anything, despite it saying non motorized water sports. Snorkeling offshore was $35, diving was $100. Playa del carmen is nearby and is quaint, lots of restaurants and nightlife, but if you plan on spending any time in the resort, just know this is NOT a luxury resort at all. After the fiasco with our two rooms not being ready and then moving from the noisy one, the one we got ended up flooding from the ceiling and maintenance had to come. we hinted that we'd like an upgrade due to the inconvenience but the front desk guy said \"no problemo, we fixed\" and just didn't get it. Concierge was great and checked on us the next day. bellboy and taxi service great. Bar service was great, no complaints about the pool bar or the drinks. service in the cafeteria was a bit slow getting drinks but very polite staff. don't drink the red wine, it's horrid! if you eat up in the alacarte you can buy a good bottle for $15 though. Only one pool and very clean, no bugs or debris in it at all, but although it's divided into sections, activities, adult and kids, it can be super noisy when they are playing volleyball, playing music or dancing etc. We met a lot of other couples there and the first thing most of them said was \"did your travel agent tell you this place was a four star?\" as we were all under the impression it would be a bit more upscale. If you do go t here, you can get a 50 min massage on the beach nextdoor for $20! that was amazing! I would have been ok with this hotel (motel) if I'd paid $500 or less, but since we paid $900 each, I\"m pretty sure we could have got way more for our money elsewhere.", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Canada", "Title": "\u201cCaveat: Prepare to relax . . .\u201d", "Author": "dharmacate", "ReviewID": "UR62836853", "Content": "If you base your choice of resort on luxury and grand size, keep looking. Grand Coco Bay is an intimate 210-room hotel located in Playa del Carmen where everything is within a three minute walk from your room - spa, restaurants, beach, pool, bars, water sports, gym . . . We were a group of six women in our 30s-50s who love to walk, but on the beach, not all over a resort. The staff were very helpful with varying levels of fluency with English, and as always any attempt on the guests' parts to speak Spanish is welcomed with grace. Thanks to Victor and Zoila at the bell station and front desk. Our rooms were spacious and spotless and located on the top floor above the restaurants. We only asked for maid service every other day, and were always kept supplied with plenty of clean towels and amenities. A huge plus in our thinking was the waiter service near the pool and on the beach. Our favorite server for the week was Orbel\u00edn, whose smile and genuineness were a delight. It is good that the drinks are not made too strong, but they are hardly watered-down as some reviewers complain. Gilberto at the pool bar says he has seen some tourists rendered almost catatonic if he makes the drinks to the customers' demanded strength, as they believe that to get their all-inclusive money's worth, they need to imbibe from opening until closing time. We were pleased that they used more environmentally sound rigid, washable plastic glasses around the pool and not disposable ones as some resorts have turned to. The beach itself was great but the prime real estate claimed by the rarely-used volleyball court front and centre seemed strange. There could easily be many more loungers and palapas placed there, and the court maybe off to the side somewhere. We were never bothered by the anchored boats. The water was clear and warm and the most azure coloured of any Caribbean destination we've visited. It had an almost luminous quality which could be attributed to the brilliant white Mayan sand, and was very safe for swimming. A ten-minute walk to the south brought you to the pier in Playa where a short walk up one street brought you to the fun and shopping of colourful Avenida Quinta and its cheaper, less-touristy side streets. A must-do! Food choices were amazing considering the small size of the Grand Coco Bay. Make a connection with M\u00e1ximo and his helpers at the snack bar, and you will enjoy some fine chicken, salad, pizza, and other fast-food. In the buffet, our group of Atlantic Canadians were delighted at the freshness and daily availability of lovely firm grouper, roughy and other firm-fleshed white fish, grilled or in various seasoned sauces which did not overpower. There were always two soup selections with lunches and dinners, and on the buffet itself everyday, some form of chicken, beef, pork, sausage, and vegetables, plus salads. Theme nights were delightful, especially the Asian evening, with sushi, shrimp and calamari teppanyaki, spring rolls and tempura that melted in your mouth! We like the Mexican a la carte enough to go there twice. The presentation rivals some fine dining restaurants we have frequented around the world. I recommend the Mexican sampler appetizer, the GCB salad, the seven chili soup, and the coconut shrimp. We loved the ambience of the Italian a la carte, and the food was fine, but not stellar. We ordered wine as the house wines were not at all palatable. We were more than impressed with all of the food here. Side trips were made to Isla Mujeres, Tulum and Ya-Kul, cenotes, etc. I can recommend personally the services at the Ya-Ax Spa on the resort, where Bety was so professional. I chose the combination relaxation/Shiatsu/aromatherapy massage and paid 80 dollars (plus tip) for an hour.

And if you can't find something to eat at the buffet you need help! The food was amazing. Very clean resort, beach was a little crowded for our liking but still great. I will miss Gilberto greatly...he was my favorite (pool bartender). A walk to 5th ave was only 15 min or $5.00 by taxi. The only \"watch out\" factor was the concierge will try and talk you into going to see their sister hotel...Real I think it was called...anyway, it seemed to be a time share type thing...so just avoid talking to them and you'll be fine. Didn't really take part in the night shows as we were exhausted at the end of the night and just cuddled in the room and watched movies. I would go back in a minute! I have to agree with a previous review....lots of french Canadians.... Last part...the gym wasn't that great....one treadmill had torn tread and the bike couldn't adjust the seat. Lots of free weights and weight machines...just not much for cardio....I got my cardio by making trips to the bar", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable.....\u201d", "Author": "christinek6", "ReviewID": "UR59666530", "Content": "We arrived after 12 hours of travelling and were received at reception with 4 papers to sign all written in Spanish before we got whisked off to Sandos Caracol Ecopark and Resort for 4 nights. According to the Grand Coco Bay, the reason we were given for being at another hotel was that there was damage done to floor tiles by some spring break bunch. Upon return we were upgraded to an oceanview room, given a champagne bottle and a fruit plate in our room. This was on account of the fact that my husband called twice to the hotel from our ecopark location to inform them that we wanted an upgrade for our inconvenience. Once at the hotel we were very well looked after. We did not pay for anything extra and Alicia from guest services was very helpful. They have a very friendly staff who works very hard, especially in the restaurant. The food was good. The beach was the nicest I saw with no sea weed. There were boats in front of you which marred the sight. You could walk for miles on either side. The location of the hotel is excellent if you want to walk into Palya del Carmen and onto Fifth Avenue. That is why I chose to be here and was seriously disappointed by being located outside of Playa for about 4 days. However, they did make up for it at Grand Coco Bay. We rented a car from Europ Car rentals and Alicia was very helpful with that. We drove to Chichen Itza and stayed overnight to view the ruins early in the morning. That was awesome!! We travelled there on the toll highway which was very expensive but got you there. On the way back we travelled on the free highway and you have to have a lot of patience as in each small town you have to come to a full stop to cross over speed bumps or topes as they are called. That was cumbersome. Upon return of the car, we got ripped off for gas at the Pemex station, the government owned gas. We couldn't say for sure if it was Pemex or Europ car but I would hedge my bets that it was Pemex as it even rips off its own people. Alicia and the staff were very helpful to me when I went back to the gas station in a taxi and had a big blowout with the manager who lied to me straight to my face that he didn't even talk to Alicia nor knew what I was talking about when I got there. Sick country to do that to tourists. I am writing to the Mexican Ambassador to complain because I resent being taken advantage of while I am paying as a tourist and giving money into that industry. As I said, hotel staff were empathetic and helpful. It is a small and personable hotel; you get to know staff quickly. Entertainment at night was not bad. I usually went to sleep quickly so it didn't bother me when I didn't quite see it . Overall, I enjoyed myself at the Grand Coco Bay-good location, friendly and helpful staff, good variety in food and small hotel where you don't have to walk miles to the beach.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlottetown, PEI", "Title": "\u201cThought it was great!!\u201d", "Author": "PEIGirl46", "ReviewID": "UR59237258", "Content": "We just returned from Grand Coco Bay and thought the resort was wonderful.

What I didn't like, compared to my first stay there in 2007, is that some staff were not too friendly. Not at all rude but somewhat indifferent in dealing with requests. (The fornt desk.) The pool bar staff were not so friendly. I wonder if it's because we didn't tip them during the day as we decided to do it at the end of the day.

In fact, we returned for 2 weeks again in Feb. The place is a 4 star resort and as far as I'm concerned, lives up to it. The beach is superb with sand better than anywhere else. It's a quick walk (10-15 min. ) into Playa Del Carmen in one direction and an endless walk on a relatively quiet beach in the other. The amenities are fine. The food was more than passable despite what other reviews have said. There was a lot of variety at the buffet. You would have to be a very picky eater to not find anything you liked. The a la carte restaurants are great although the service is a bit slow at times. I found the house wine to be acceptable. The lack of beverages in the room is a minor inconvenience. You are steps away from a bar at any given time. I never saw them run out of drinks at any of them. The staff are very friendly and courteous. No, most of the housekeeping staff don't speak much English. They're Mexican! How's your Spanish? All of them will respond to a simple \"hola\" with a smile. They have a spa there that's new this year. Great treatments by very professional staff at prices comparable to home. The rooms are fine, nothing deluxe but more than adequate, very clean and comfortable. It is an older hotel so things aren't always pristine, but there is nothing here that would constitute a health hazard by any means. We had a poolside room with a hammock and 2 lounge chairs. Very nice if you want a bit of quiet. The pool does tend to get a bit noisy at times. The beach not so much. Yes, you have to get something on a lounge before 8 a.m. to reserve it but that's true of most resorts I've been to. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. They are always working at it. This is a smaller resort which appealed to us. No walking for miles to get to the restaurant or beach. Everything is close at hand.

It was small and everything was convenient. Our room was spotless. The balcony and landscaping were nice. The pool was cleaned daily. There was a \"fenced off\" area for the little kid's pool that seemed to work real well for them. We did not care for most of the food but we watched many people fill their plates and eat every bite. Many people comment on not enjoying the Mexican food (not only at this hotel, but almost every hotel). The Mexicans will tell you that Americans have Americanized their food to the point that they do not recognize it. We are expecting to see tons of cheese, onions, black olives, sour cream, etc. Not on their food! The Fruit Loop person had me looking around the hotel the first day or so for all the horrible things they experienced. I could not find them. There was NO oil slick on the water. The boats did not bother us at all. I remember reading that the hotel catered to the French. I would not say they cater to a specific nationality, and the French are French speaking Canadians. The resort was mostly Canadian vacationers. The beach is beautiful and you can walk a long, long way in either direction. It is about 10 minutes to downtown Playa on the beach. Contrary to a recent review, downtown Playa is NOT far from the resort via the street. Many people walked to town every day. 5th Avenue is a lot bigger than we expected. Wear your walking shoes. This is not the small, open-air markets we have found in other cities. Some people brought in animals for us to hold and they took our pictures. You could purchase the pictures the next day. There was a python, 2 tiny monkeys, 2 iguanas, a Tucan and the big white \"Barretta\" bird (sorry, the name escapes me). If you do not like very strong coffee, and drink a lot of it, you might want to think about packing a small coffee maker. My husband could not drink the coffee although many people loved it. The water bottle issue isn't that much of an issue. Think about it. If there are 200 rooms and two bottles of water a day, that is a lot of plastic. This hotel just might have the right idea. Water bottles could be filled at any of the bars. On the bathroom mirror, it said the tap water was drinkable but we chose not to try it. Spending my vacation sick is not how I envisioned it. There was a gym that appeared to have pretty decent equipment; however, it was so cold in there, we left right away. Obviously, we were not to excited about exercise while on vacation. The first week was rather cold and overcast. Very few people were in the pool. When it warmed up, the pool filled up and the swim up bar opened. Check out the mango marguarita. Excellent! The conceiege was trying to get us to see a time share; however, when we could not confirm our pickup, he was very helpful. He helped us several times. He can book trips for you. We used Loomis Travel (office in the hotel lobby). I enjoyed Michael Jackson and several of the other shows. They start early and end early. That is nice. Being outside in the fresh air and sun tires you out. We did not go to the disco - same reason, bed called early every night! Would I recommend this place? Yes, I guess I would.

I hadn't realized that 10 years had passed since I was there last. So feeling exhausted from life and work I decided that I should go back and rejuvenate my soul there once more. I checked out google and was surprised to see the magnitude of changes partly due to the hurricane and secondly due to progress and growth of course. I choose Grand Coco Bay because I wanted to experience the same peaceful and relaxing setting I had when I stayed at the Club Bananas hotel which was pretty much at the end of 5th at that time. When I looked at trip advisor's reviews I was some what worried at the sight of the boats anchored in front of the hotel beach. But when I arrived all my fears were put aside when it became clear that there was an ample stretch of beach that extended far to the left of the hotel. I have to say that the waters are not the crystal clear waters I remember on my previous visits.But they are still a beautiful blue. Grand Coco Bay hotel itself is not as large as many of the hotels in the central zone and definitely not as new but it is not overwhelming either. It is cozy and clean. The food is good and again I have to say the staff are friendly, kind and try extremely hard to provide the best service they can. It's a good group of people that provide service there and I was amazed at the kindness and consideration demonstrated by every staff member, from the gardeners to the management. It is obvious that they take pride in the jobs and the service they provide. I JUST WANT TO SAY TO THEM ALL HOLA! and NOS VEMOS! Hi! and WE WILL SEE YOU AGAIN! The animation team again very friendly and helpful. They are a source of information for new travelers to Playa Del Carmen. Again I was there with a girlfriend to relax and rest. So it was really nice to find a young man at the hotel who had a ceramics kiosk near the pool area in which he also sold unpainted ceramics for hotel guests to purchase and paint , maybe keep or giveaway as gifts. I found this so entertaining and relaxing. Moms the kids really enjoyed this as well. That brings me back to the feeling of the hotel. It is a great place for family and mature guests who may not be as into the party scene etc. It is relaxing and restful. But if you like the party scene and the shopping it is just a 10 minute walk to 5th ave. for all the fun and excitement you may want. 5th Avenue is really bright and beautiful in the evening so you should make a point of going at least once and bring your camera.

This is a small and older resort, as we expected. It definitely doesn't have the \"wow\" factor of some of the big resorts, or small \"boutique\" resorts, but the size is excellent (for us) and the beach was great. I didn't even use my water socks in the ocean, as there was no coral to step on, that I came across. We also enjoyed the proximity to Playa del Carmen; we walked into town several times with our daughter and enjoyed the entertainment, shopping, and food. The resort itself could use some repairs here and there, but was always very clean, and we had no problems with our room. It was excellent to have everything within such close walking distance to our room. All rooms have a balcony or terrace; some have hammocks and others have hammock chairs or plastic chairs. The pool was nice, including the jacuzzi pools with a view of the ocean - these were not hot, just a tad warmer than the cold pool. What I enjoyed about the buffet was the nice view of the ocean from the open-air windows. Breakfast was my favourite, as it usually is in Mexico! The made-to-order omelette station was excellent. Drinks were more limited here than at other resorts we've stayed at. For example, bartender Gilberto at the pool bar had to buy mint himself so that he could make a limited number of mojitos, as the resort did not provide mint. We used the Mexican and Italian specialty restaurants, and our meals were good at both. Our daughter used the kids' club and loved playing with Liz. It was not well advertised - there were very few children stopping by. They have a nice little facility there for the kids though, with washrooms, craft supplies, games, tables, TV and movies, and a nice playground in the sand. Liz made balloon animals with our daughter, bracelet making, etc. It was unfortunate more children didn't participate though. I enjoyed a massage at the spa for $60 US/hour, which was very nice. Our daughter also liked the two turtles who live at the little pool in the lobby.

Beer was available to all that wanted to purchase it for cheap. We bought expensive mixed drinks at the airport so next time I will stick to a good, cold, cheap beer. Got to the hotel in no time and we were in our room right away! I did let it slip that it was a repeat for us in the hopes that it would ensure a good room. No worries on that account. We had a king-sized bed in a quiet area and that is all that we really asked for. The rooms are nice enough, not totally luxurious but good enough for all the time that is spent in the room. For repeat visitors the resort gives out t-shirts and we think a bottle of champagne\u2026we were napping and didn\u2019t really comprehend the champagne because we thought it was a time share thing so we just took the shirts. Next time we will know better. There are time share people that try to entice you to go to the Royal for a visit but they honestly didn\u2019t bother us at all to go.

If you have to resort to eating Fruit Loops then you really shouldn\u2019t be wasting your money on a holiday\u2026 The beach was as good as it was 2 years ago with maybe a little less width to it. There were always plenty of room and beach chairs. We had a few very windy days so it was nice to have the option to go up to the pool area as well. The sandblasting on the beach was quite awful 2 of the days we were there. The spa and massage therapists were out in full force while we were there and I did have a massage on the beach while we were there. There are many opportunities downtown to have massages as well. We saw a deal for an hour long massage for $18 US. I paid $30 US for a half hour at the resort. It was good but the next day I was pretty bruised from her working my shoulder with her elbow\u2026is that normal? The resort is a short walk on the beach or on the street to 5th Avenue and all the shops and sights. We enjoyed going both ways, depending on the temperature and what we were doing that day. We would walk to Playa to catch the collectivos when we went to Akumal for our snorkelling days and when we went to Grand Cenote. The collectivos are the best and economical way to travel down there. We recommend taking a trip on your own to Akumal. We take our snorkel gear and just spend the day in the area. It really has amazing snorkelling if you want to see the giant sea turtles and beautiful fish. The one day we went we saw 6 turtles and a very large (harmless) barracuda as well as other tropical fish. We do highly recommend investing in snorkel vests if you like to snorkel. The peace of mind it brings is amazing. Being that this was our 2nd time to the resort and to the area we did learn some valuable things. #1: Check your receipts! One large (Mega) store I went to overcharged me over 800 pesos. I checked and the 1 dollar book marks came in as over 16 dollars and I had bought 4 of them\u2026Very glad I checked that out! #2: Do not pay a tip if there is already a \u201ctax\u201d. I specifically asked and was told it was a tax. We paid a tip on top of that and plus the band and then found out later what it was. I should have recalled reading about it on the forums but I forgot. Apparently Karen\u2019s is notorious for it though. I actually went back a few days later and complained and got my tip money back. #3: Go check out the entertainment in the evening. They are pretty good. Sometimes they even bring professional dancers and entertainment for the guests. I highly recommend that you see the Michael Jackson Show. He is pretty talented. #4: Go to Bad Boys bar in Playa! What a great place to listen to classic rock, dance and enjoy the beach and ambiance! We had a great time there! #5: Relax and go with the flow\u2026I think that can be said for most things. You are on holidays and life is too short to get angry or worried about the small stuff. Have fun and then go plan another trip!

The check in process was painless and we were directed to our room. We were not happy with the room that we were given and asked to upgrade to an ocean front room which was not a problem but cost us $350 US extra for the week. The safe we were given was a key lock which meant keeping track of a key for the week. Kind of a pain. The location and size of the hotel are great! It is an easy walk along the beach to Fifth Avenue and we appreciated the size of the hotel especially after walking past some of the \"mega\" resorts with what seemed to be thousands of lounge chairs lined up right beside each other on the beach (way too crowded!). The food at the hotel is fine. Any one that \"has to eat fruit loops\" for breakfast every morning (previous review) and could not find anything to eat is obviously just looking to complain. The breakfast was great. The dinners were good but not great but we only had dinner three of our seven nights. We did eat at the \"Mexican\" restaurant. It was not great. I had coconut shrimp which came on rice (nothing too \"mexican\" there!). The entire menu did not scream Mexican though. My husband had the Grouper and said it was pretty good. We did make a reservation at the Italian restaurant but ended up at a beach front patio and missed our dinner. The drinks were also just ok. I am a white wine drinker and the white wine at the hotel is....ummm....well.....gross. It's never a good sign when the wine comes out of tap I guess. I finally had to buy my own wine and keep it in the room fridge. This hotel seems old. The rooms seem this way as well. No frills for sure! You are given two bottles of water in your fridge at the beginning of your stay but if you want more, they cost $2 US. You can refill them at all of the bars though. We did not stay at the hotel very much because we like to venture around and do our own thing so this hotel was ok for us. I would rate it a three star at best and trust me, I am not overly fussy. We LOVED the area though! Beaches are awesome, snorkelling is great, Fifth Avenue is fun, locals are friendly, Cozumel is a must see! We actually stayed in Cozumel for a night and rented a jeep to tour around. Xel-Ha is good (a little touristy) for first time snorkellers. The meal there was really good! Our favourite part of the trip was the back part of Cozumel! There are miles of secluded beaches and no one around. We went to the Mega (grocery store) and packed a lunch and beer and had a great picnic on our very own beach! If you go there- you have to rent a vehicle or you will miss a ton!

This was our second holiday at the grand coco bay in less than a year, our first time being in April 2009. And we are going back again in May 2010. When we first arrived here , it did not look like much from the outside. but once we walked in we were simply awed. It was beautiful, they greeted us with a glass of champagne and friendly smiles, and took us to our rooms on the main floor, with sliding doors right out to a stunning pool. I might add the garden around the pool area is beautiful. The beach and ocean were truly amazing, we spent many hours a day in the ocean in front of the hotel, boats are not a problem cause they are far enough out you dont even get close to them. My kids absolutly loved it. The food was great and the staff are fantastic. We missed them all so much we went back in dec. Now i will say they food was not as amazing the second time as the first but i am thinking it was due to thier recent swine flu epidemic and the shortage of staff. However we were given the same rooms as our first time, a walk out the door to the pool and all the drinks you could ask for. They even cut down coconuts from the tree and served us them filled with long island ice teas. Eduardo is the best!!!! The Ala carte restaurants were still fantastic, but the buffet was only open one one side, so less of a variety, but the food was still good. The Entertainment staff are truly the best. Hector, Lalo, Arturo, Deigo, and Charlie they go out of thier way to make your holiday fun. Its a short walk to the shopping and lots of night life.. The kids went to the Coco Bongo one night with Arturo and Hector and had a blast. We met some great people from all over Canada and Us and it was just a very relaxing, whole lot of fun vacation. I couldnt complain about anything but then i am not looking for a 5 star resort where everything looks pretty but really isnt. What you see is what you get here, there is nothing hidden, no extra costs, no long line ups, no 15 minute walks from your room to the pool or the beach and no one hassleing you to buy a time share.

We read all of the reviews for GCB and thought that those with negative experiences must have been picky. Boy were we wrong.

DO NOT go to Grand Coco Bay if this is what you are looking for. The drinks are THE WORST I have had in my life. They come in small plastic keg cups and they all taste the same.

There is only 1 bar at open at a time. The buffet was basically the same everyday. The ala carte was buffet food on a pretty plate. The snack bar is OK but good luck finding some sort of menu or someone to help you. Nice beach. The boats parked in front of the beach didnt bother us. There is NO WAY you can swim out and snorkel near the hotel. All of the beaches in Playa ARE public so thousands of people walk by ALL DAY. NO BEACH SERVICE. Basic hotel room. Bed was OK. TV squealed. You cant flush toilet paper. There is what they call a \"mini bar\", which consisted of a \"Coca Cola Light\", a regular Coke, and 2 Orange Fantas, with 2 bottles of water in the bathroom.

Just finished reading the last review - were we staying at the same hotel? Returned back from a week with family. Check-In: Disorganized to say the least. Arrived quite late and the staff available at that time were not as helpful as the front staff during the day. Requested side by side rooms, one with a King Sized bed (yes, they have King sized beds available for guests). First set of rooms met our first criteria but when our key didn't work on our room, they found a more suitable room for us without asking! We had to pay for the safe but it was $3.00 a day I believe, not $8 and we had a key code, not a lock and key. There were only two bottles of water in the room, at a charge of $2 each. You can fill up your water bottle anytime at the beach bar, pool bar, snack bar and front lobby - NOT from your tap (even though it is potable). The water they provide at all restaurants / bars is safe and nice and cold. Pop in the room - we only received two the whole week but here are a few bars all around the resort where you can ask for one! Rooms: When we finally got to our room, they were in a fantastic location. Ground level, right beside the pool. I would highly recommend this location as you are 30 yards away from anything at the resort! Rooms 2158, 2159 and 2160 and one other room on the 2nd floor directly above us. Food: Was definitely more than ok. No need to eat fruit loops every day! For those who think the food is repetitive, it is at times but use your imagination! If you eat something different at home every morning, I think i'd like to move in with you! Breakfast: There were always eggs (any way you want them), great omlette station, two kinds of potatoes, pancakes, french toast,danishes, fresh fruit, yogourt, fresh juices and more. The coffee is better in the urn at the entrance to the buffet! Lunch: We weren't around too often to enjoy their lunches and didn't need it. You can go to the buffet or go to the snack bar. Snack Bar: French fries, burgers, nacho chips, pico de gallo (hey, that's Mexican salsa! I think we have it wrong in US / Canada and they have it right - when in Mexico...), chicken and chicken wings - all excellent from our point of view. Dinner: Italian a la carte is amazing! The choices are unreal. Very nice atmosphere and the wait staff were super nice. Mexican restaurant just as good but for some, it was an acquired taste. They setup the auditorium a few nights during the week, buffet style and themed so you can eat then watch the show. A nice change from the regular buffet. Shows: Excellent! Why? They aren't hokey like the other resorts, they dance and sing for one song then onto the next one - done in an hour. They start at 8:30 as well which is great. Beach: Excellent - no need to say anything more! Spa: Got a massage from Bety at the Spa - super nice lady and the massage was excellent! I recommend asking for her and experiencing what they have to offer! Excursions: You always get a little burnt on excursions and we've travelled often enough to know that you can do your own thing for less than half the money and have a better time doing so. We rented a car one day (approx. $50) and four of us drove to Akumal (parking $3.00, snorkeling with the turtles FREE). Then drove to Tulum (parking FREE, $5.00 admission for Tulum). We ate at a local restaurant Pollo Brujo - very nice. So for approx. $100, all four of us took two excursions and saved ourselves over $300! Cozumel: We took the ferry over ($14 each way) - ocean very rough and many people were ill - very ill. Rented a jeep ($55) and toured around the whole island. Found many shells, enjoyed the many beaches and stopped for lunch. Again, we saved at least $300. Playa Del Carmen: We walked a few times for shopping excursions - the walk is an easy 15 mins. or a $4 or $5 cab ride. In town meals: PG's Sports Bar shows hockey games each night - they have a list of which games are on and available, if you want to come back and watch one, let them know! The fish taco's are excellent and the beer is cold. We also ate at El Fagon, close the Wal-Mart and Mega stores. Whoever blogged about that on the Playa Del Carmen site was bang on - amazing! We'd go back in a heartbeat! Honestly, the hotel would not be for everyone however, it is definitely not as bad, not even close to being as bad as some have suggest (reference reading the latest review)..... It is nice and small (we met people who stayed at the Princess who said it took 25 minutes to walk from their room to the beach and they paid $1500 each for their holiday - put it all into perspective and it makes for a fantastic holiday! Not a lot of night life at this hotel but heard the same for the Princess. A lot of people go into Playa del Carmen to enjoy. I would definitely recommend this hotel for the price point we paid (less than $1000) hands down and would go back for that reason - it allowed us to do everything else we wanted to do, enjoy some peace and quiet and at the same time, go out and spend money on what we were in Mexico to enjoy!", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cSwine Coco Bay is what this should be called Dawn from Toronto was here\u201d", "Author": "dawnkara", "ReviewID": "UR53381717", "Content": "Hi, I booked a trip via ITravel 2000. I had a party of 5 My sister, brother-inlaw, my 2 sons and myself. I was told by Itravel that this was a 4 1/2 stars.. This is a flat out lie.. Were do I begin.. First off this is a 2 star at best.. If you are looking for a 2 star then this is your place to go. BUT let me tell you our CRAPPY VACATION.. We pulled up at night. From the outside, it looked OK.. I knew this was a small resort, I did know that. OK lets get back to my waste of money vacation at Grand Coco Bay Was greeted at the front.. NIce, At check in, I was told that my reservation ( booked a junior Suite for 3 and a reg double occupancy ) WELL ALL the rooms are the same.. They have only standard 2 queen bed rooms. (THIS IS ITRAVEL\"S MISTAKE) SO, after paying for my share ( well I paid for myself and my boys) I did not have a bed to sleep in myself.. I WAS PISSED from the start. I was not offered a cot, Nothing.. Ok then, I asked for a safe.. its 8 dollars per night and they give you a lock and a key you out in the safe.. ( well not even that could be simple. ) we had to walk down to the front desk to get another, as the first one they gave us did not work). Then we settled in and was SHOCKED STUNNED Livid, as I noticed that the room did not have bottled water.. EVEN in the bathrooms, no botteld water.. A sticker on the mirror states that the water from the tap is ok to drink..;EEEK I really dont believe that the hotel tap water is drinkable.. Well AGAIN this was an issue, as the hotel states in their claim to fame, ( IN ROOM BAR) well that means there is a small fridge but it is empty.. I HAD TO ASK FOR A BOTTLED WATER) Well by day 3 I got 2 bottles of water and 4 cans of pop placed in the fridge. ( if you want more bollted water it costs.. Ya the booze if inclusive but the water is $2.. ( you can refill it from the tap if you want.. Ok then we went to the bar in the lobby.. Each and every bar serves there drinks differently, so if you like consistancy... you are at the wrong place.. On the first evening I told my boys to tip well anyone who looks after you, as they will look after you well for the week. LET ME TELL YOU, that our family tipped $200 us dollars that week. ( not by my choice, but the boys 18 & 21 were generous with my money.. I can tell you that only 1 lady tried her best to look after us.. SHe was only in the lobby bar so she could only do so if we were there. I am just going to make bullet point for the next many inconveneices as this could end up being a novel . * NO hand soap in the mens room by the POOL.. We even told and made the manager come to see on day 3 as no one listened to us for 2 days.. CAN YOU believe that after all the swine flu H1N1 scares that any hotel in Mexico does not have soap.. NOT EVEN SANITISER anywere... How discusting.. It did get filled on day 5.. The bathrooms are discusting in the Buffet Room, yes were the food is served.. * OK FOOD,, well i was so grossed out by the food, I only ate froot loops, UNTIL they ran out on day 5 ( I left on day 5) I was starving.. The buffet served what looked like dog food each night ( and then served again at breakfast ) I asked for SALSA and as my sister explained to a lady from the spa, what salsa was and how to make it.. WE are in Mexico and we got salsa on day 5.. The food was cold, minimul, and swarmed by fruit flies.. SO THE FOOD SUCKS>> ok letsget back to service.. I complained to management and they sent our rooms a letter appologising and then left a bottle of tequeila.. YES sorry we lied and get drunk so you dont have to think about it.. The food served at the pool smack bar.. OMG hard as rock clubhouse.. sitiing for hours.. french fries,, were cooked in cold greese and you can imagine how they tasted. NOt one good dish from the snack bar.. And the mens room with no soap is right beside this.. * the hotel was taking in weddings and private parties by locals, aproximately 3 funtions in the 5 days we stayed there. SO the space we would normally have access to was off limits to the hotel guests. The staff was assigned to the party so we were watching the party have great service and all the attention.. * and the food that we watched them serve the party looked good.. ( but i think we were served the leftovers for breakfast the next day on the buffet. * one more thing, they advertise 2 restraunts.. well only one is opened at a time and you better book a reservation by 9 am or you dont get in.. ( just grab frootloops and put them in your pocket, thats what I did) * the pool lets talk about the pool.. Well I saw a few kids in one day.. The swim up to pool bar never opened once.. The bar was opened on one side but the swim up one never did. * THE HOT TUB<<< ha ha ha, it was colder than the weather we left in Canada. No one was in it.. OK LETS GO TO THE beach... OMG it looked like a marina if front of us.. there was over 20 boats floating infront of our veiw each day.. BUT the sunshine on the water and the oil was like a rainbow.. how nice.. NOT. They had 10 or so straw umbrella's ( sitting on the beach) not working ( iwas told it was due to the hurricane they had there and they got damaged.. ( WELL that was 2 years ago.. get rid of them or fix them . It was a tease.. Half of the beach lounge chairs are broken.. you can lay down but they dont sit up.. Am I picky??? OK do I have anything nice to say?? I am trying really I am.. BUt the only good thing I can say and please believe me when I tell you THE FROOT LOOPS WERE GREAT.. Until they ran out.. Before we arrived I told the family,, NO TEQUELA,, it will haunt you.. WELL that is what I drank most of the time, for a few reasons.. I love mamosa's,, but could not keep pulling fruit flies out,, it turned me off. The mixed drinks ( frozen ones ) each bartender made them different.... So I adked for the dark tequela,, salt and lime.. You cant go wrong with that.. We checked out on day 5 and went to THe REEF, It was like the taj mahal in comparison to the COCO BAY.. So, I forgot to tell you about the pay phone, I went to, to make a frantic call to my travel agent... I picked it up and it was full of SNOT.. yes, runny snot, and it stayed there for 2 days,, it could still be there, i dont know , i left after that.. SUMARY... THis hotel in my opinion, is a place to go if you take day trips every day, if you are wanting to loose weight and perhaps get the flu, I am still sick and I have been home now for 2 weeks.. It was 4 years, since I had a vacation, and I wish I could have enjoyed my whole vacation.. Once we moved ( NO THANKS TO SUNWING OR ITRAVEL) we took a cab and walked to find a new hote.) we paid a cab to change and never had any help . We even paid out of our pockets the hotel bill at the Reef. SO I am disappointed with the whole thing.. and I will think twice before using any of the service providers.

I would have settled for a smoothie over the food, but no smoothies. -Lunch and dinner were changed up daily, and I did have meals in there that were enjoyable. But overall I would not recommend their food. -I had an upset stomach almost daily while on this trip. My girl friend did as well although not as much as me. I can not directly connect it with food, as I was drinking a fair amount of booz all day long, which my stomach was not used too. -Attention they charge extra for room safes. -House wine is GROSS. -Air conditioner didn\u2019t go below 26 degrees. Despite it being looked at. -Hard beds, (lthough nothing harder then any other hotel in Mexico). -Each room is only entitled to 2 bottles of water per day, any more would result in substitution of the soft drinks( not like I cared, but signs of a cheap management) Really Bad -Nothing stands out as being really bad. This was my 4th all inclusive in mexico, First in Playa. I would come back to Playa del carmin although I would not go back to Grand Coco bay. Grand coco bay is a nice place with great potential. It would have been interesting to have seen it prior economic recession & H1N1 because I have a feeling they are in contingency mode.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canby, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cI'm ready to go back!\u201d", "Author": "brentmmcneill", "ReviewID": "UR52109737", "Content": "We just got back from our trip on Dec 20th and we're ready to go back!

The food at all the of the restaurants was always fresh - and as you ate/when you were done the waitstaff were right behind you cleaning; never a dirty dish in sight. Juan Carlos at Lomas travel is fantastic - he went through a bunch of travel options for day trips and helped us select the one that suited us best. We went snorkling at Xel-ha, followed by a guided tour of Tulum - well worth the day trip! The entertainment staff was fantastic - we saw a Michael Jackson Show, an Native Aztec Show, they had casino night and we watch a Las Vegas Show... all were fantastic - the staff were amazing (Carlos, Arturo, Lalo, Joshua and Hector) Shopping is fantastic, you're minutes from 5th Avenue and all its vendors, restaurants, etc... and for only $5 US you can take a taxi practically anywhere in Playa Del Carmen (we went to the Walmart and friends to the Mega). We purchased jewellery from the Jewellery store on site and they were perfect at finding the right item at the right price! LAST BUT NOT LEAST- is our fave bartender GILBERTO! He works at the pool bar - he is fun, knowledgable and just a plain great guys - he makes FANTASTIC margaritas and coco locos! He made my vacation even better by being able to visit with him each day! While my trip was only 6 days - I would definitely go back and for longer next time - I really enjoyed being there and the service we received. At first our safe and TV weren't working well, we called the front desk and within 15 minutes both were fixed without further issue. We never had to fight for a chair at the pool or ocean - you could move freely between both - During our trip we met a great bunch of people from Alberta, BC, Quebec and Michigan!

I prefer ones like the Grand Coco Bay. It is small (I believe approx. 210 rooms), on the beach, close to shopping, great staff & service, great food... This was my first trip to Mexico - it was for a family member's wedding. They were married at a different (large) resort so we had the opportunity to spend the day there. Which allowed me to compare a big resort vs. a small one. This may not matter to some but if you are looking for a smaller resort, I recommend the Grand Coco Bay. The resort is located right in Playa Del Carmen so we walked to 5th Avenue for shopping. It is also located right on the beach. Since it was windy during our trip, we spent most of the time by the pool - which is great as well! The staff worked very hard and were all very friendly. The front staff & doormen are very welcoming. The entertainment staff created fun and laughter. Waiters and bartenders were excellent! Housekeeping staff were great. The gardeners seemed to work every day, trimming hedges and tidying the yards! :) We booked some excursions through the travel booth in the lobby - they were very helpful and recommended the best activities for us! Restaurants are good, lots of food to choose from at the buffet. The bar in the foyer was very busy most of the time and allows smoking. There is a 'disco' upstairs beside the restaurants, it was very quiet so as a group we spent some time there having a few drinks and talking.

It wasn't as fancy and secluded as some of the resorts we passed by in our shuttle...but it was perfect for us. The resort was cozy and comfortable - the pool, beach and restaurants were within walking distance and it had all the amenities we desired (internet access, swim-up bar, beach front, all-inclusive). The resort was only operating at 17% capacity during our stay, and we were definitely pampered with no lines, waits or reservations for the ala carte meals. In fact, all the meals were ala carte (except for the final lunch, in which Eduardo got me ceviche since it was my last meal there). I don't know if I could return now for the Buffet, since I really enjoyed the ala carte meals. :P The only downside was they served \"International\" three of the six nights we were there, and the menu wasn't our favorite. But we chose this place because it was light on the wallet, so we could enjoy some excursions, traveling, and eat in the city of Playa del Carmen, which is easily accessible by foot. We walked into town two or three times and usually took a taxi back (for around $3-5). The staff was amazing - Gilberto the lobby bartender went out of his way to help me when I had a sore throat and suggested a great restaurant in Playa - not to mention his mixing fun and delicious drinks. Hector of the entertainment staff was also very nice - he got us hooked on Water polo and volleyball. The cleanliness of the rooms was great, and there was some construction happening inside our resort and next door. I wasn't put-off by this - brought ear-plugs...and realized that I'm in a foreign country so I just shrugged some things off. Plus - the resort is open all the time. Construction will have to happen during operating hours. There was nothing dangerous in need of fixing. With the humidity there - mold happens. *shrug* You get what you pay for. And for what we paid - the important things really were of top quality - the service, the food, and the atmosphere. It's a beautiful resort...and the beach is quite nice compared to some others. The boats did get a little old after awhile, but they weren't overwhelming. Every now and then you did smell gas - but I attributed that to the wave runners (highly suggested!). We snorkeled on the public beach and saw many beautiful fish. I wouldn't suggest snorkeling on the beach directly in front of the resort. I would certainly return to this resort...but am not sure it would be nearly the same with more people there. We enjoyed easy access to lounge chairs wherever we wanted and the pool was always nearly empty. I WOULD NOT suggest renting a car through the resort. Go to Playa. The car rental company tried to rip-off the other couple we split the car with. The rental attendee claimed it was returned at 11:00am the next morning with a flat tire, even though it was perfectly full the night before (around 11:00pm) when we dropped it off in the spot. The situation was easily remedied with $5...so basically the guy was trying to pull a fast one. Not sure how that could be avoided. :P It was nice to have a rental car for a day though! Overall - the resort satisfied our needs. It was budget friendly, clean and gorgeous. The atmosphere was relaxing and even kid friendly.

The cleaniness of the place is unbelievable. The service is also fantastic. Several outstanding people were Gilberto at the bar, He would make sure your drink was ready whenever you were ready for one. Francisco and Guadalupe at the buffet. I enjoy ice tea in the morning and Francisco would specially make it for me and kept my glass full. Guadalupe did the same in the evenings at the buffet. They were exceptional in their service and attitude. They were always ready with a smile and helpfulness. It really added to our trip. A few points we would suggest: 1) Bring agua shoes for swimming in the ocean. The floor of the sea has a lot of coral which dig into your feet. 2) We were planning on swimming out ot the reef when we were there and several people did but it is about 200 yards from shore. 3) Definitely sign up for the speciality restaurants. We enjoyed both of them but definitely the Italian more. 4) We enjoyed that this resort is very casual so if you are into dressing up, this is not the place for you. 5) We walked to 5th Ave but it is a hike but we felt safe. It is definitely worth seeing. We took a taxi back for $5.00 and there are plenty of them. There is also taxis around the hotel so transportation is not a problem. 6) At the airport after you get your bags and get through customs keep going until you are outside. That is where your real transportation is. Otherwise you get approached and herded to where they are trying to get you signed up for time share stuff. Just keep walking until you get to the outside doors. 7) Bring tip money. $1's go a long way. We had booked our trip through Expedia used Best Day for our pick up at the airport and return. We can't say enough GOOD things about them. They were exceptional. We waited no more that 5 minutes before they had us loaded up in a shuttle van. The next day we met with Roman at the hotel and he was awesome!! We set up our return trip and he let us know about some of the tours without being pushy. He said he would call us the next day to see if we wanted to do any of them. When he called we met him at the hotel and set up the Mayan Adventure. We highly recommed this tour. Eddie was our tour guide and picked us up right on time. He was also exceptional. He made this trip for us. We snorkeled in a lagoon for over 1 1/2 hours where we saw all sorts of fish, brain and fan coral, a turtle, etc. After that we went to a cave where we swam. It was beautiful (and cold but sooo worth it). It was crystal clear. Then we ate and it was great food. Then we went to a cenote and swam. We had such a great time and it was definitely one of the highlights of the trip. I hope this helps.

Coco Bay did not have any part in this, just the concierge.

We thought it would be very busy during this time of the year; however, there were not huge crowds. I guess it's because it's a smaller sized resort. We were there just as word broke out about the swine flu, but nobody made a big deal about it at the resort. My husband was in a leg cast on using crutches, but we decided to continue with the trip as planned. Upon our arrival (we got there several hours early BTW, but they still let us in our room), the staff was friendly and helpful. Although we didn't book a handicap room, they accomodated us and got us into a nice room near the lobby (so my husband didn't have to walk too far). The room was in a hallway a couple of doors down from the lobby bar, so at night it was really loud. If you have young children or are a light sleeper, you might consider a room away from the lobby. Our room was central and close to the pretty much everything, the general store/shop with some basics and food items, a jewelry store, tour sign-ups, bar, computer area, money exchange, coffee/tea center, and auditorium. FOOD: The food was okay, nothing exceptional. I guess we were expecting more Mexican food since we were in Mexico, but there was hardly any. The buffet was a different theme each night--Asian, Seafood, Luau, etc. During lunch it was pretty much the same stuff. I'm a vegetarian and didn't find too many options.The staff around the resort were very friendly. My son was a regular at the snack bar and pool bar -- the staff got to know his preferences, which was nice. The snack food was mediocre, serving hot dogs, burgers, nachos, sandwiches, ice cream, pizza. It seemed like they were always out of stuff. Reservations for the a la carte restaurants were accepted during breakfast, so you have to get there early if you have a preferred time. We tried the Mexican and Italian and both were just okay--the desserts were terrible though. We left tips (a couple of dollars) each time we ate and had drinks. I don't think it's expected, but I know the waiters and bartenders appreciated it and remembered us when we ordered the next time. BEACH: This was the best part of the resort. Unlike the mega-resorts, the beach was easy to access and we always found a couple of louge chairs (we arrived early in the morning as advised by others on this site). The only bad part is that there is no food/beverage service at the beach, so you have to walk up to get it yourself (a small price to pay since it is so close to the bar). The nice part is that the beach is private, for hotel guests only and security guards made sure the people from the public beach right nextdoor didn't come onto the resort's beach. There were several tour/activities vendors walking around. My son and I did parasailing for $60 each, which I thought was pricey for a 10 minute ride. We used the snorkel equipment, which was free. There wasn't much to see, unless you swam out pretty far to the reef, which we didn't. POOL: The pool area was nice and clean. Again, you would want to arrive early in the morning to save a seat. There's a nice area where you can sit in a lounge chair that is placed right in the water (on a step), which is neat. There were some funny pool activities throughout the day. It was fun to watch the staff and guests dance, roll around in the sand, and act silly. My son enjoyed playing water polo and pool volleyball every day. The pool bar in convenient. There were massages right off the pool area, next to the beach, which looked nice (if you don't mind other people watching you while you get a massage). SHOWS: We watched a few of the shows put on by the staff. They were very funny and entertaining. I wouldn't pay to watch these shows, but it was good, light-hearted entertinment. There is a pre-show for young kids, and that was fun to watch too. We didn't visit the nighclub, but could hear the loud music all the way in the lobby (even though the club is on the opposite end), so it must have been a happening place. A couple of times I saw some staff taking groups out to local nightclubs. We went in to town (5th Avenue) twice and it was just a $5 taxi ride. We enjoyed the shopping and food there. We had a regular room guest -- a small lizard that would crawl up the walls, across the floor, behind furniture. Fun to watch, but kind of creepy. We heard from other guests that they also had the \"visitor\" in their room. So, I thought it was pointless to switch to another room. Overall, we really enjoyed the resort (minus the food). It was a good value for what it was. We are ready to go back soon and wouldn't even consider a mega-resort. We would like to try some excursions/activities next time. I can't imagine how long it would take to walk around those huge places.

We were greeted with a glass of wine at check in. Room 2310 was standard with a great view of the pool and an extra large balcony. Room was very clean with a large bathroom. Maids did a great job daily. Hotel was only at 30% capacity so there was never a problem with pool or beach chairs, plenty of towels and umbrellas/ palapas. Buffet was good, good variety and a new theme everyday. Two reservation restaurants, italian and mexican. Both very good but only took up to 30 people a night at 4 seatings so if you didn't get it reserved early then you might not get in. Happened to us once and they rotated the restaurants everyother night. Not sure they always do this but then again there weren't alot of people. Snack bar had great nachos, burgers, ribs, steak sandwiches. Open througout the day and then reopened from 11p-1am. Always something to eat even if you are a picky eater. Three bars at the hotel. Drinks were great, never watered down and great service from bartenders and servers. Pools and pool areas were cleaned daily. Plenty of beach area to take long walks and about a 15 min. walk to 5th Ave which had many shops and restaurants. Water was very calm with few waves. To the right of the resort was a great reef for snorkeling. There were many boats docked but never a problem and I only noticed a slight exhaust smell one time. Took an excursion to Maroma for jet skiing and snorkeling. Well worth the money spent. Tour guides were very knowledgeable about the area and did a great job assisting us with our activities. Saving the best for last was the entertainment staff at Grand Coco Bay. They were always there during the day for aerobics, games and alot of beach and pool volleyball. All of the kids loved them! At night there were shows or games for both kids and adults. Thank you very much to Tania, Omar, Hector, Carlos, Eduardo, Lorenzo, Wilbert and Orlando! They went out of there way to make sure that the guests had a memorable time.

If you are looking for an affordable Mexico vacation, with a great beach and quality food and service, this is the place for you. We stayed at Coco Bay from 5/8 thru 5/15. We debated on whether to go or not, because of the flu scare, but are so glad that we decided to take the trip. Hotel capacity was at about 7% and we had the beach to ourselves! Choice of beach chairs and Palapas everday, no lines at the bar, and most meals were served a la carte due to the decreased visitors, meaning there were not enough people there to justify putting on a buffet meal. Reviews of this hotel are sometimes sketchy, but I really don't know why. We booked an ocean front room and that is exactly what we got. It was fabulous! The air conditioner worked, the in-room safe worked, the hot water worked! The ONLY complait I might have is that the maid forgot to leave me coffee for my in-room coffee maker several times, but all I had to do was call housekeeping and they would bring it. Big deal. So, if you want to escape to the sunshine, feel the ocean breeze on your body and not pay a fortune to do it, this is the place. GO! Oh yeah, the massage on the beach is fantastic too.

We had never been to Mexico before, and kind of picked this hotel with no idea what to expect and maybe a little apprehensive from a few reviews on here. But you know what- I loved it. Grand Coco Bay is in a perfect location on a beautiful stretch of beach. We basically had the whole beach and many times the whole pool to ourselves! (I think this has to do with the Swine Flu scare- word is many tourists cancelled their vacations). It was great for us though because we nearly had the whole place to ourselves. We had booked a standard room, but when we arrived I asked the lady at the front desk for an upgrade if available. She was really nice and gave us a complimentary upgrade to an Ocean view room with our own balcony. We were psyched! The view was perfect. The staff was super friendly. Every time was passed a housekeeper in the hall they would stop what they were doing give us a huge smile and say \"Hola!\". Restaurant staff was equally as pleasant and friendly. My boyfriend didn't like the food- but he's picky- I thought it was alright. I especially loved the Italian a la carte restaurant. It had a 5 star restaurant feel to it, the staff treated us like kings and the food was so good. The swim-up bar is a lot of fun and the bartender makes these really cool drinks in coconuts pulled down from the palm trees with a really fun presentation. The property is safe. They have guards out on the beach at night and all around the property. (Although, it almost seemed like overkill- there were a lot of them!) But better safe than sorry I suppose. Playa del Carmen itself was a short walk down the beach- 10 minutes. We walked there and I was totally blown away by the amazing night-life there! It was hoppin'!! And there were so many cool trendy bars with friendly staff, good drink deals, and outdoor couches to lounge on. Really neat! Especially 12th street. Blue Parrot was a really fun club, partially indoors and partially outdoors with a dance floor out on the beach. Lots of fun! The only things about the hotel itself that we weren't psyched about- just so you get the full picture are 1) Our first night there having dinner in the downstairs restaurant we saw a critter scurry across the floor and into a hole in the wall. I thought it was a lizard, but my boyfriend says it was a mouse. Either way, the way the dining area is, its all open for the breeze to come in so I could see how it could happen. 2) Our room didn't have any air conditioning, so during the morning when the sun came in it was real hot, but overall we liked having the patio door open with the breeze coming in so we werent too bothered. Im not sure if the property itself just doesnt have air conditioning or if it just didnt work in our room. But we didnt push the issue because with the breeze coming in the patio it was actually kind of pleasant that way. I could see how it would bother some people more sensitive to heat though. 3) On the Expedia site for Grand Coco Bay there is a long list of the all inclusive water sports included at the hotel, including sail-boating which my boyfriend was really set on. But when we got there the only watersports the resort actually had were kayaks and snorkel- gear for snorkeling. There were no sail boats. In any case we took out the kayaks and it was a great time paddling through the beautiful blue water! There are a lot of people's boats parked in the water outside the hotel, but I thought it looked cool and you can just walk 2 seconds down the beach for a clearing. The boats didnt disrupt swimming at all. All in all, I loved Grand Coco Bay! It might not be a 5 star property, but if you're the kind of person looking to go someplace in a gorgeous location, enjoy the pool and the all inclusive bars, and the BEAUTIFUL peaceful beach, then Grand Coco Bay is where its at!", "Date": "May 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Martinsville, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Vacation\u201d", "Author": "NailsVacation", "ReviewID": "UR29874759", "Content": "Me and my Hubby were absolutly amazed with this resort.

We throughly enjoyed ourselves and are planning to return to this resort in the future. The hotel and grounds were very clean and sanitary. Some of the pictures I've seen from a recent post were rare occurances because we did not see anything unsafe or unclean while we were there. The maid service was outstanding. They always had our room cleaned and left us clean towels daily. The food was great. We've traveled to Mexico 6 times now and the food at this buffet was the best from all of our trips to other resorts. Every morning they have an omelet bar set up and make them while you watch. They always had a great selection of fruit along with other choices to complete your meal. Types of food changed out every night with a different theme. There was 2 a la carte restaurants, Mexican and Italian. We ate at the Mexican restaurant and the food and service was comparable to the fine restaurants that we have eaten at here in the States. We did not eat at the Italian restaurant but other guests were raving about it. Our decision was that the buffet had great food and service and why dress up and make reservations when we were satisfied with the buffet. Snackbar was excellent. Guacomole was out of this world. It makes my mouth water thinking about it right now. The entertainment staff was as good if not better than some of the \"WOW\" resorts that we have stayed in. They had plenty of activities planned during the day and included everyone that wanted to be involved. Their nightly shows were good. Our favorite was the \"Michael Jackson Show\". If you had not know better you would have believed that Michael was actually there doing the show. The beach was GREAT! It was clean and there was plenty of room and loungers for everyone. Yes, there is boats anchored off the beach of the hotel but most of them left out in the mornings due to snorkling, fishing, and diving excursions. They would return later in the afternoon. There was always room for guests in the water and we did not feel unsafe. It gave me a great photo opportunity with the boats out there. With the reef protecting the beach and the boats we had our own private snorkling area. There was better snorkling there than some of the other areas that we have snorkled in Mexico. The drinks were good. If we had any complaint it would be with the pool bar. They would not fill our Bubba Kegs and the service was slow compared to the other bars. When they refused to fill our Bubba Kegs my spouse just ordered 4 drinks and than poured them into the Bubba Keg in front of the bartender. That was one way to beat the system. The other way was to go to the bar at the buffet (Miramar Restaurant). They would fill the larger containers with no problem and their service was much quicker due to the fact that most of the guests went to the pool bar for their drinks 5th Avenue is within walking distance of the resort either through the streets or along the beach. We walked it both day and night and felt very safe. If you are thinking about a vacation at this resort we would highly recommend it to you.

I have to tell you that we have stayed in several resorts in the Riviera Maya, as well as a few in Cancun, so I think i can really compare. For the money, this place was amazing. Yes, it may not have had the \"wow\" factor that some of the more pricey resorts have, but the beach was incredible, the food was outstanding, the rooms were clean and newly refurbished and the service was impeccable. The food in the buffet was different every day - even at breakfast there were changes. There are two \"a la carte\" restaurants - one Mexican and one Italian - that I think are as good as any restaurant I have payed for. The staff is incredible. We had one small problem in the room, and when I went to the front desk about it, they said someone would be there within five minutes, and it was fixed. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this resort. Unfortunately, we were there during the swine flu scare. Please, if you are thinking about it GO. Right now, there aren't many people there, the service will be the best you will ever see, there is no flu anywhere in the Yucatan, and we are just killing the people there by not going. As to the difference about staying at a more upscale place - yes, here you do not have waitresses on the beach, and you don't have the var in your room and you may not have quite as many choices of restaurants as at some of the others, but for what you are paying, believe me there are plenty of choices. You just have to walk A FEW FEET to get to a bar. There is no wireless in the room but ther is good broadband servie in the lobby for $5 per day. The fact that it is within walking distance ( and a very easy walk at that) from 5th street in Playa is just an extra bonus. I really don't know what the complainers are talking about.

We tried both the Mexican and Italian restaurants, I enjoyed the Mexican more as the pasta at the Italian place was a little bland. Try the Black and White Cream Soup in the Mexican restaurant.

My wife and I chose Coco Bay based solely on value and location. Neither of those factors were disappointing. It was a great deal in a great location; very close to 5th Ave. Overall it was clean, well kept and the employees were helpful and courteous. No bells and whistles, just function. That said, I found it a problem not having waitresses or waiters, in the pool area. I am not sure about the lobby bar because we never used it. I know it may sound \"stuffy\" complaining about the lack of a waiter, but that's how it is. I'm on vacay to relax, etc.; not to wait on myself. The staff was great otherwise, so I think it's a management issue. The boats people have commented on can be an issue also. Alot of gas fumes, and just plain unsightly. We aren't talking about a few boats, either. A few boats may add to the scenery, etc. One guest characterized it as \"a parking lot for boats\". I didn't count, but atleast 20 or more. Some never left, some were always coming/going, and some left and never came back?? It seemed the area was open to whoever wanted to use it. The real problem is that to one side of the resort, there was nothing but vacant beach property for a few miles. I also found the \"resort\" to be too small, in general. It felt like you were right on top one another. The food was below average, but we used 5th Ave. alot - and intended to, so it really didn't bother me. Once again, great location, good staff, and good basic attributes. The management needs to address the waiter and boat issues that I mentioned, as I was not alone.

Initially we had wanted to stay at one of the large resorts such as the Barcelo Maya or the Palladium. Unfortunately, they were not within our budget so we chose The Grand Coco Bay based on price and the beach. We booked through Sunwing which was great, no problems at all. We stopped at several resorts along the way dropping off other guests and some of these resorts were breathtaking! (THE WOW FACTOR). Not so for us, the neighbourhood is quite rundown and when you pull up to the resort there is a big ugly empty lot right across from you . Rooms - Old but they were very clean and made up fresh for us every day. The housekeepers were the friendliest of the entire staff. Tip them well, they deserve it. Food - Buffet restaurant looked and felt like a cafeteria. Food was just ok . NO GUACAMOLE. Breakfast was the best. Fresh omeletts, fruit, pancakes ect.. Chicken burger at the snack bar was really good, enjoyed the daily soups. Staff- Some were very friendly and some were not, however I always felt safe even when walking around by myself. Felt uncomfortable sometimes when asking for drinks and food just because it seemed like they were understaffed and not friendly. Entertainment- We do not party or drink but this place was DEAD after 6pm. Cannot tell you how the nightly shows were because we did not go. They are behind closed doors in the lobby and that is the last place we wanted to be while on a carribean vacation. Went down to 5th ave most nights and spent a couple nights sitting on the lounge chairs by the beach. Beach- This was by far the best part of the trip and the reason we booked here. The pretty blue water you see on postcards is what the ocean is like at this resort. Soft white sand, no rocks or seaweed in the water. Every morning we would walk up and down the beach. The boats at the front of the resort did not bother us, they were out farther than we would ever swim. The reef in front of the resort kept the water calm and if you wanted waves you just had to walk 2 minutes down the beach where you would also be free of anchored boats. On our last day the water was crystal clear, and made it hard to pack up and leave:( All in all it was an excellent vacation, but I think it should be rated 3 stars not 4. Next time we will pay the extra money for a resort with the WOW factor. The location was great to explore 5th ave and how can you complain about a room that is a 30sec walk to the beach? I would not go back to this resort but if you are on a budget and just looking for a resort with a nice beach and good location to explore 5th ave than this is it.

Driving into the resort can be a little disheartening because the neighborhood is a little rundown, but immediately upon entering the resort all of my inhibitions were gone. The resort is absolutely beautiful and extremely clean. We were welcomed with champaign by an extremely friendly staff, most of whom knew our names by our third day. Everyone was very accommodating and out going. Our room was above the lobby which was a little loud, but the view made up for it. The beach and pool were gorgeous, with the beach being cleaned regularly. By the end of the day the pool needed a good cleaning (straws and such floating from the swim-up bar) but it was always taken care of by morning. Our room was spotless, linens and towels changed daily and we watched the maid scrub the floors of the neighboring room after check-out. I NEVER ONCE FELT UNSAFE.

Having never been to this \"side\" before (been to the Puerto Vallarta side) we were not sure how it was going to differ. We chose this resort because of the beach (the reviews here were mainly good) , the closeness (within walking distance) to Play del Carmen town and the price. We were travelling with our kids (19 & 17) and were there from March 28 - Apri 4. We did not take the all inclusive, as we don't drink much and wanted the variety of choosing to eat in town. We booked through Conquest vacations (obviously just squeeked in before the bancrupcy). They were awesome, meeting us at the airport, very friendly, got us into our van and took us to our hotel. On arrival at Grand Coco Bay we checked in with no problem and were all handed a glass of champagne. Our kids got the room on the 2nd floor right off the lobby which they thought was great. The view was of the garden - they didn't care. Our room was downstairs right under the lobby and while the room itself was okay after one night I asked to change as it was too noisy. You could hear everyone walking, chairs scraping on the floor and the bar is right in the lobby so it was fairly noisy. The next morning we asked to change and they gave is 2317 and that's when the vacation really started. It was a great room overlooking the palms, the pool and it was quiet. No ocean view but that was ok. It had a balcony with 2 chairs and table. We had 2 double beds - it wasn't the king that the original room had, but that was totally fine with us. It was clean and the maid service was great. They changed our linen every day. We had breakfast in the restaurant every morning and it was good. The omelet lady made your omelet to order - there was lots of fresh fruit, buns, fruit, yogurt, french toast, pancakes, etc etc. I learned later that they do offer a la carte. Oh well - we didn't have lunch so we stocked up on breakfast. The entertainment crew were really fun - they got people in the pool with water aerobics, then pool volleyball, Spanish lessons, dance classes, step classes, beach volleyball and always friendly, smiling, laughing. And to top it off, they performed at night in very comical shows in the room off the lobby. Some really funny, simple, amusing shows. The worked hard! You can walk to Playa along the beach and get there within 10 minutes or take a cab for 40 - 50 pesos. (Ask the price before you get in). There are lots of shops and restaurants and things happening on 5th avenue. We're not big partiers so we didn't do much of that, but our son, who is 19 did go with the entertainment crew a few times into town on their scheduled \"party night\". They went to Coco Bongo's which my son really enjoyed. It was very pricey though, $70 ? for ticket and and open bar. Unfortunately he doesn't drink so it was expensive for him, but he met lots of people and had a great time and enjoyed the show! Dinner at The Grand Coco Bay in the buffet was pretty good. The Italian night (Sat) was really good and so was the Fri night Gala dinner. Lots of variety, no line-ups, great service. There are two a la carte restuarants upstairs, but we didn't go there. I must say before ending here, is that the beach in front and on either side (for a long way) of our hotel was fabulous. Yes, there were boats out front . They were'nt coming and going - they were just moored there. There were a couple of jet skis, but that was it. We swam right in front of the boats, or went a few feet on the other side and you could swim right out to the reef were you could snorkle. If you haven't seen the Caribean water - you must. It is so beautiful and blue and the sand is so white. We also did an excursion to Chichenitza (sp) which was very interesting. If you take that tour, make sure you include the cenote tour too.

Not perfect, but not as bad as some people have made it out to be. We have visited the Mayan Riviera a number of times and have usually stayed at the bigger places a little further south but wanted this time to investigate Playa del Carmen so we picked the GCB for its location and price. As some other reviews have stated, it\u2019s a bit older than many other resorts and showing its age a bit. Having said that, it\u2019s very well kept and much smaller than the bigger beasts like the Bahia Principe Akumal, where you have to jump on a tram to have breakfast...not so here. There\u2019s maybe 200 rooms and you can walk from the front door to the beach in under 60 seconds...and we kinda liked that. Our room was very basic but functional. A/C worked fine, TV fine, bathroom fine, beds no problem, internet terminals in the lobby for cheap (2 bucks Cdn. for half an hour if you really had to keep in contact). We had a ground floor room and it was pleasant to sit out on our \u201cdeck\u201d in the late afternoons and watch the many little kids splash around in the tykes pool...lots of families there, which was no problem even though my wife and I are \u201cempty nesters\u201d. Food in the buffet was just OK but as others have mentioned, we found ourselves eating our breakfasts there and having a burger or ribs or pizza at the poolside grill for lunch...seemed to work better. The \u201ca la carte\u201d places (only two of them) were actually quite good and there was never a problem getting a reservation and no limits on how many times you went....we ended up going to each of them twice during the week we were there. Both had a good selection of food and it was well prepared...a nice surprise really. While it is true that you can\u2019t get any food after the dinner buffet closes there\u2019s lots of restaurants in town not far away and a 7-11ish store (OXXO) about a five minute walk if you really need that bag of chips. Basically, if you\u2019re looking for a 24/7 resort...this is NOT the place. The beach is very nice and because of the natural sand bar out front you do see a couple of dozen smaller fishing boats parked there because the water is calmer, but there\u2019s certainly lots of room to swim before you get anywhere near the boats. They are short of palapas, no doubt about that, and the situation was exacerbated the week were there as there was a large contingent of folks from Quebec who completely dominated the beach locations...we rarely got near the sand because there was just no room...and we couldn\u2019t stand the smoke anyway. I normally have no problem with our French cousins but by the end of the week it got oppressive...which was sad. Not that we would have spent much time there anyway as the gale force winds that we have experienced on earlier trips to the Mayan Riv. were cranked right up for all six days of our holiday...between the that and the sun, it can beat you down pretty bad by the end of the day. The pool area is nice and pretty big and there\u2019s always lots of loungers there but not always under an umbrella. Although the resort is at the far north end of PdC, its not a long walk to 5th Ave and it seemed a bit nice to be a bit out of the way. We even walked it late at night and it felt totally safe. Younger couples seeking a more central location near all the action may be advised to be further south by the ferry pier...more convenient. Not sure we enjoyed PdC all that much though....seemed pretty crass and loud most of the time and walking down 5th only makes you a target for the million and one vendors hitting on you for cigars, taxis, silver et al.

We have travelled to Dominican Republic, Cuba, Mexico plus we have gone on a couple of caribbean cruises. We have stayed in 4-5 star resorts in the past. We arrived at The Grand Coco Bay Resort around 11h00pm. Check-in was fast and efficient. We were greeted with a nice smile and a glass of champagne. Nice touch! We were told that our requested oceanfront room was not available for a couple of days. Just to make it clear: we originally booked a regular room but after emailing the reservation manager and getting more information...we decided on an oceanfront room. We got in to our regular room. It is a typical 2 double bed hotel room. It was nice and clean. Unlike what another poster stated..our air conditionner was not motion activated and worked well through the night. A couple of days later, we got our oceanfront room. There is a surcharge for the oceanfront room but there are some extra amenities such as : a king sized bed,a flat screen tv, minibar service daily with beer and soda, 2 free bottles of water per day, a coffee maker and..of course, the view. I can't even tell you how beautiful the view was. We sat on our balcony for hours and just enjoyed the view. We ate at all the restaurants and buffet. The food was excellent! We enjoyed it so much. There wasn't a big variety because it is such a small resort but the saying \"it's the quality and not the quantity\" fits this resort very well. I tried to taste a little bit of everything and I still never found something I didn't like. They have a 2 week menu at the buffet, so the themes were always different every night that we we there. The a la carte restaurants (Italian and Mexican) were very good! The service was excellent at both restaurants. We never had a problem getting a reservation. We ordered room service every morning and found that they were always on time and brought everything requested. The beach was beautiful! I had read reviews about the boats in front of the resort and I thought that maybe this would bother me but it didn't. We found that the boats appear closer than they really are. We had plenty of room to swim. The beach is protected by a coral reef about a 1/4 mile from the shore. It protects the beach from erosion plus calms the water. My husband went snorkelling around the reef and saw many different fish. There were plenty of beach chairs but lacking a few palapas. There were many palm trees that did help cast some shade. We walked on each side of our beach and found that our beach was the nicest. Some have been greatly affected by erosion. The pool was nice and refreshing. There were plenty of chairs and parasols around the pool area. They have a swim up bar and a section to play pool volleyball. There is also a section for young children. The staff at this resort are so nice! We were always greeted with a smile and \"hola\". The animation team do an amazing job every day. They get there in the morning and are still there for the evening performances at the theatre. We played beach volleyball with them everyday. The maids, security guards right up to the guest service manager were very friendly and polite. This is the 1st vacation that we got to know the names of most of the staff. The water dispensing machines were found at the lobby and all the bars. You can reuse the 2 free bottles that are given to you at check-in. Water was available at all restaurants and the buffet by glass. The drinks at the bars were excellent. They used real fruits in the drinks not just the slushy things that some other resorts use. My favorites were bahama mama and caribbean sea. We did an excursion through Alltournative and it was called Chikin-Ha. We got to do some zip-lining, bike in the jungle and swim in 3 cave cenotes. We were part of a mayan ceremony and a great authentic mayan meal. We had a lot of fun! The location of the resort is nice because we were just a 15 minute walk by beach or street access to get to 5th avenue. A cab only cost 30-50 pesos per way. All in all...we really enjoyed our vacation at the Grand Coco Bay resort. I do have a few suggestions if any of the managers does read this review. I would like to see the disotheque be transformed into another a la carte restaurant. I really believe that the clientele of this particular resort would much more appreciate another restaurant than a disco hardly ever used and that is not in a good location since the noise level disturbs all the rooms around it. My second reccomendation would be to add nicer and more comfy lounge chairs on the room balconies instead of the plastic lawn chairs. Other than that it is perfect!

On our fourth morning we had just woke up and heard a cracking noise by our front door. We then watched as the floor tiles lifted and cracked all across the room to the patio door. I went to the front desk and told them what happened - they offered to move us - again - but to a room with 2 small beds. We declined as we weren't moving again. On March 12 the resort was invaded by Studentcity.com. These out of control children were disgusting to be around. Around 5 one afternoon I was sitting outside our room and this teenage girl proceeded to lift up her dress, pull down her panties and pee right in front of our room. I hollered at her to knock it off and she just looked at me and kept on going. I called the front desk but no one came over. Management and security did nothing to control these idiots. The police were also called. A petition was started that every sane person signed to get moved to another resort. I overheard the Sunwing rep state that people would be getting refunds and we too are trying to get a refund.", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cLoved it - except for the last night\u201d", "Author": "Teppilein", "ReviewID": "UR26294640", "Content": "We spent our honeymoon at the GCB and absolutely loved it.

On Friday evening, a bus with 400 18-year old kids arrived at the hotel. They came with Breakaway tours, who apparently send Canadian kids to international destinations for their Spring break, with minimal adult supervision and NO structure (parents beware!) The teens literally went nuts, drinking, running, screaming and pounding around the hotel until well past 2am. We, and all the other adults staying there complained loudly at the front desk, but they said the manager wouldn't be in until 9am, and they were trying to deal with the situation (the security guards we saw weren't doing anything). By about 2:30am, they managed to somewhat quiet the kids down, but even then there was still some noise. Needless to say, we didn't sleep much. Final thoughts?

We chose this hotel for the location, and the price. We also chose the non-all inclusive package due to the fact that we wanted to go out and explore the area and restaurants in Playa and Cozumel. We choose this hotel based on the reviews. We travel quite a bit and have stayed at high end as well as lower end hotels. We are not hard to please as long as the hotel is clean and safe. After booking this hotel, I called to confirm our reservations directly at the hotel twice. The last time was the day before our arrival. We were assured everything was okay. When we arrived at the hotel to check in we were told that we did not have a room for the week and they were going to send us to another hotel that was 20 minutes south. The only explenaition given to us was that there was a maintenance problem with the floors. So they then paid for our taxi ride to the Palladium which is a 5-star All Inclusive MEGA resort. The staff at the Grand Coco Bay resort could not understand why we were disappointed that they were sending us to a better class hotel and giving us and all inclusive package. They kept repeating to us how we were getting such a better deal. Yes the Palladium was rated a 5 star (closer to 4) and all inclusive but this is not the vacation we planned. We purposly did not book a MEGA hotel. We wanted to be in a hotel close to Fifth Avenue and now we were a 20 minute cabe ride away, everytime we wanted to come to town it cost us $20.00 US for a one way taxi. Out of 10 days I think we came in to town at least 7 to go to Cozumel and shop and eat on Fifth Ave. So I don't think we really got the deal Coco Bay thinks that they gave us. Upon checking in to the new hotel I noticed we were only booked there for 7 days out of our 10 day vacation, so I called Coco Bay again to inquire. They told me that we would have to come back there our last 3 days of our vacation because they would have a room for us then. I told them that I thought that was unacceptable and would have to stay at either place for the entire trip. They booked us the entire time at the new hotel. We also booked a shuttle from the airport to our original hotel when we booked this trip through Travelocity. When the shuttle picked us up from our new hotel to take us back to the airport to go home they informed us it would be an extra 30.00 because this hotel was 20 minutes further from the airport than the original hotel which Coco Bay would not pay for. We are not complainers or nit pickers. We made the very best of our vacation and had a great time.

There was a group of 8 (family & friends) of us there for 2 weeks and another 4 joined us during our last week. We chose this hotel mainly because of the smaller size, location and price. We have traveled previously to Puerto Vallarta, Varadero, Cuba and Montego Bay, Jamaica. We always stay at smaller, lower star resorts and have always loved them. I unfortunately can not same the same of the Grand Coco Bay. The first thing we noticed about the resort was the different layout. The lobby bar and entertainment area were both inside \u2013 which is different from any resort we\u2019ve stayed at before. In the past we would enjoy sitting by the pool and listening to the entertainment, without having to actually sit in the audience. At GCB the pool and beach bars closed at 6:00 p.m. so after that you had to move inside. This wouldn\u2019t be a make or break it for us \u2013 it was just different. We live in Canada and we\u2019re inside from October to March \u2013 when we go to Mexico we want to be outside as much as possible. The rooms are fine. Everything was clean (rooms, restaurants, beach). We did have several problems with our room (air conditioning leaked badly 2 separate times, 1 day we had no power at all and 1 day no hot water). We also saw a hotel garden worker spit right on the ground between the pool bar and the bathroom. Considering how many people walk around the pool area in bare feet we found that pretty disgusting. These problems also wouldn\u2019t make it or break it for us. The reason I have to give this resort a negative review was because I didn\u2019t feel safe after a few different incidents. The first one happened about 4 nights after our air conditioning was finally fixed. I was coming back to my room on my own at about 1:30 a.m. About 10 seconds after entering my room there is a knock on my door, it was a maintenance worker who asked to look at our air conditioner. I asked my boyfriend (who had been in the room for about an hour already) if he had called but he didn\u2019t call anyone so the guy left. It was weird considering it was 1:30 in the morning but at the time I just thought maybe they got the wrong room and someone else had called. A few minutes later I realized I was out of drinking water so I went down to the lobby to fill up my bottle and on the way back to my room a different worker grabbed my arm and pulled me towards him. I said \u201cno\u201d and pushed him away and pretty much ran back to my room. My boyfriend went right back down to the front desk to complain about it. He thought that the guy who came for the air conditioning had likely followed me to see if I was alone and then must have saw me going back down and told another guy. The people at the front desk just didn\u2019t seem to care. They said that there was no maintenance staff working on our floor and that was it. On another day I came back to my room to grab some more suntan lotion at about 5:00 in the afternoon and when I reached the top of the stairs there were 2 workers sitting there \u2013 they got up and walked away but then when I got in my room the phone immediately rang and they said it was the front desk and that they needed me to hand in my beach towels. I didn\u2019t have any beach towels and just told them so and hung up \u2013 but it seemed really weird that having been gone all day they phoned me when I was only in there for a minute. The rest of the trip I didn\u2019t feel comfortable walking around the resort on my own and neither did a few of the other girls in our group. The maintenance staff seemed to walk around in groups and hang out in the dark hallways of the hotel. We also saw them repeatedly coming out of the same corner room on our floor which was a guest room but we only ever saw staff coming in and out \u2013 never any guests. I would not walk around town at night on my own in a different city (or even my own in certain areas) but I think travelers should feel safe in their own resort and we didn\u2019t. We are an easy going couple and have never had to give a bad review before but I can't recommend this resort.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff!

A bit of background on us, we've are 'seasoned' travellers and have been on many trips in several countries, and have stayed in various types of accommodations from 5* resorts to renting cheap apart/hotels and making your own meals, etc......The GCB was rated as a 4 star iwhen we booked, and we believe it was well rated and deserves to be praised. I am comparing this resort to other 4* I've been at, as it would not be fair to compare it to the 5+. This is a long review. Here goes. Thumbs-up to Lisa, Julie and Rachel - our Go Travel Direct reps in Mexico. Great job - as usual ! CHECK-IN & FRONT DESK: Our check-in was easy as we were only four people checking in at that time. We had requested ground floor rooms and were very pleased to find we had been accommodated (probably the first time since we've travelled). We also had friends joining us over the next three weeks and went to the front desk to make arrangements for them to be close to us. The front desk was always very accommodating and very helpful even though we knew the resort was full - unlike the mega resorts where we were always told - sorry we are full, nothing we can do. HOTEL/ROOMS: The hotel is small, private,(which was the main reson I selected it as I was sick/tired of the mega resorts and line-ups everywhere you go). The thatched roof gave it a great 'tropical' look. The hotel is shaped as a 'U' and every room has a view of the great pool in the centre. We were lucky to have rooms on the ground floor, with our own little 'private garden' and loungers. The rooms were kept very clean, and are in very good shape. Based on earlier reviews, I was expecting outdated rooms, but was pleasantly surprised and we were very, very comfortable. The beds are 'firm' but we found them comfortable and slept well for 3 weeks. FOOD: Reservations have to be made every morning for the a-la-carte restaurants. This is the only negative thing about it as the line-up starts very early (6:45am) and the restaurants have limited seating for each hour. If you think you'll get there at 8am and reserve for 4 people, you're out of luck (especially at the italian resaurant). Both restaurants have great food. Service is a bit slow, but at least they are not rushing you out for the next seating, so sit back, relax and enjoy - it's well worth it. Breakfast: Buffet was good and has an omelette station. My husband missed the bacon, sausage and meat he likes for breakfast. I, on the other hand, did not miss it at all. They do serve meat for breakfast, but mostly chicken, pork or beef stews a-la mexican style. On occasion, there were little beef steaks or mini weiners. Lunch: For the first two weeks we mostly ate at the snack bar by the pool. They have fantastic BBQ chicken, the best quesadillas with guacamole & salsa, and also have burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, fries, ribs, ice cream, nachos, etc.... The third week, we made our way to the buffet for lunch and were pleasantly surprised with the selection. Dinner: The buffets were not the best with the low selection on the couple nghts we were there, except for the italian theme night. We heard the asian night was very good, but ended up missing it every week. The a-la-carte restaurants have excellent food and well worth it. BEACH: Fantastic beach. The nicest and calmest in that area - hence, why all the boats are anchored in front of the resort. The beach is cleaned every day, and is weed-free and clear. When you walk down the beach, you realize the waves are much bigger everywhere else, and when you come back to GCB, it is always much calmer. Yes, there are several boats anchored, but we were always swimming and they never bothered us. We would never go that deep anyways. We never smelled gas, and most of them are away on tours during the day. All-in-all, it didn't matter to us at all that they were there, it just makes the pictures nicer ! POOL: The hotel has a fantastic pool. In fact, their pool is bigger and nicer than I've seen at other much larger resorts. It is well-maintained and cleaned daily. THE STAFF: We were extremely well served by many, many of the staff. We found they were always smiling, courteous, and did everything they could to help you. The fact that this is a smaller resort, makes it much easier for the staff to recognize guests (and vice-versa), making it a more personal/friendly atmosphere. The staff remember your name, what you like to drink, and even what you like to eat. We were also quite surprised by the service at the buffets as the servers were very quick to bring you coffee when you arrived, clean-off your plates, etc... I've experienced differently at mega-style resorts. Staff gets a 5 star. KUDOS to the following staff. They all provided exceptional service with a smile. - Abraham who always made sure everybody was happy at the buffet/snack bar area. - Francisco, Bernardo, Victoriano, Guadeluppe, Samuel, Daniel, Ceasar - they are all fantastic servers at the buffet. - Carmela - is the omelette queen. - Carolina - is the friendly host at the buffet and reservations for restaurants. - Edouardo & Ruth at the snack bar. Always courteous, smiling and happy. They even prepared a 'special' order of authentic mexican quesadillas for us so we could experience how quesadillas are really prepared and served. The guacamole & salsa was prepared daily and was always fresh and wonderful. - Abelardo, Gilberto and Manuel - the best bartenders ever ! They love their job and became great friends and our mexican hermanos. - Carlos - bartender at the front lobby. - Our maid (unfortunately, we don't know her name). She always kept our room very clean and she is a very honest person - One day we left our safe open, and when she saw us later, she quickly came to tell us so we could lock it. If GCB management is reading this, we were in room 2121 and she deserves a pat on the back and a big thank you. - The bell boy/concierege - Young guy, always greeting you with a big smile and wave whenever you went in/out of the resort. Great attitude ! - Carlos, Don Juan, Alfonso, Raoul - waiters at the resaurants. They always gave great, friendly service. PLAYA del CARMEN: Only 15-20 minute walk away to 5th avenue. 5th has a great atmosphere with lots to do. Great restaurants, great bars and great shopping. We ate at Senor Frogs (twice), Karen's (3 times), Los Tulipenas ? and found the food absolutely fantastic.everywhere. Don't be afraid to eat downtown. SUMMARY: GCB is a fantastic place. Very good value. I loved the smaller size and will be looking for this style of resort on future trips. Would I go back to GCB - Absolutely and probably! I will also strongly recommend it to folks who know and like to travel at 4* resorts. For those of you who prefer 5*, buy & pay for a 5* package and you'll get the luxury you are looking for. We actually met people who thought this was the worst place on earth - although they admitted they usually travel to 5* resorts, I'm not sure why/how they ended up at GCB as it is not advertised/sold as a 5*. We felt it appropriate to set them straight and stand up for GCB, the staff and the rest of us happy travellers. TIPS: - People ate at the snack bar and didn't return their dirty plates - attracting the birds picking at their left-overs. We realize you're on vacation - but it's not a big deal to keep the place clean. You wouldn't do this at home would you? And, then you won't have to complain that the birds are all over the place !! - People with screaming kids. We realize you and your children are on vacation, but so are the rest of us. Screaming, yelling, running and crying for nothing aren't usually acceptable behaviors at home, so why think it's a free-for all on vacation? When your kids are screaming, please attend to them or at least pay attention and try to quiet them. - Grumpy people. Not sure why people aren't happy on vacation - whatever. Anyways, I have always found that when you are nice to people they are nice to you in return. It works the same way with staff at the resorts. They are people too, and there is no reason they should be treated like lower-class citizens just because you 'paid' to go there. Be nice, and they will be nice in return.", "Date": "February 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary Alberta", "Title": "\u201cBest kept secret in Mexico\u201d", "Author": "pegmal", "ReviewID": "UR24866255", "Content": "We have just completed our 6 th trip to Mexico and this was one of the best so far.

The seadoo rental people were regularly zooming about the swimming areas at excessive rates of speed in the same area as guests were swimming and snorkeling in!

This was our second time at this resort. This resort is nothing fancy at all but that\u2019s just what we are looking for. We don\u2019t like the mega resorts where you have to get into a golf cart to get from point a to point b. Everything at Coco Bay is within a minutes walk. I really don\u2019t mind getting up off my lounge chair to walk over to the bar to get a drink. The staff is friendly and they always have a minute to talk with you. In fact everyone that still works there remembered us from the year before and were happy to see us. The rooms are nothing special and kind of small but I do not go on vacation to hang out in the room so again it served our needs. The Grand Coco Bay has a great beach. There is a reef in front of the resort so it\u2019s protected from the storms and stays nice. In fact you can walk just north of the resort for a couple of miles before there is another resort, but things are changing as they are building some condos. 5th Ave. is just a short $5 cab ride. The buffet food is nothing special. Got kind of old after the 6th day but there was always something good to eat and believe me I never went hungry. The A la Carte restaurants are good for a change but be sure the men bring long pants and collared shirt. I saw a few people turned away because all they had were shorts. The hotel staff does most of the shows at night that last about an hour. These are no Vegas type shows and pretty corny but they are entertaining. A couple days a week they bring in the pros that put on a very nice show that you shouldn\u2019t miss. Like I said earlier the Hotel is small and after the show the only thing there is to do is sit in the bars and drink. They do have a disco upstairs but is empty most of the time unless there is a group traveling together. They always seem to liven it up. Sure there are a few things wrong as with any Hotel but for the price I paid for my stay I have no complaints at all. In fact by staying here I get to add 4 extra days to my vacation budget. I will gladly give up luxury for days. Hopefully next year we will go to a new destination but the next time we go to Playa we will stay at this hotel.

After booking the hotel we read some reviews and almost regreted the decision to book this hotel. However, it turned out to be an excellent vacation and those reviews we read were absolutely false. Let us highlight what was not good. The in room bar contains 4 cans of soft drinks and 2 bottles of water. That's it. If you want to have your bar replenished you have to pay extra. There were no alcoholic beverages in the room bar. Some of the staff were not so great, but 99% of them were very easygoing and extremely helpful. Now let us talk about good aspects... Hotel is located right on the beach, just minutes away from 5th avenue and major shoping and entertainment street. This area is being developed and within a year will be the nicest neighbourhood in Playa. The beach is superb, with crystal clear water and it is miles long. The reef is beautiful and snorkeling is included free of charge and is not to be missed out. Food is outstanding. We thoroughly enjoyed it. The number of main courses is not as big as in other resorts, but the quality is of the finest grade. Also, A la carte restaurants are excellent and we highly recommend them. Rooms are a little bit smaller than in previous hotels we were in, but they are OK for double or triple occupancy. Drinks... they were just amazing. Let us start with the champagne, and have it available throughout your stay. All alcoholic beverages were of high quality, the finest drinks from all around the world.

Because it is just what I want and expect. If you are looking to come to Playa and stay in an all-inclusive resort and be there solely to enjoy the free food, drinks and entertainment then by no means should you be considering this hotel. This hotel allowed us to feel free to make the trek into town daily and enjoy the good eats, drinks and entertainment without feeling like we were blowing our budget because the initial cost was just right. It also gave us the ability to have an ocean front room where literally, we were walking on the sandy beach the moment we walked down the stairs so most nights were spent lieing on the hammock on the balcony, breathing in the cool ocean breeze (even in the middle of June) and hearing the crash of the waves. So what does this place not have? Ok, so it doesn't have 5 or 6 restaurants with massive spreads of food and waiters walking around catering to your every whim. Now granted, there is nothing wrong with you if that's what you want, but for me, it's just the opposite. I doubt you can get better ceviche from any of those food troughs than you can from the freshly caught fish at the restaurant and bar right next door on the beach. And I'm fairly certain that my $8 tab didn't break the bank. I don't need someone to fetch me a drink every 5 minutes from the bar that I can easily get up and walk to 15 yards or so away, unlike some of the big resorts where you have a 50+ yard walk just to get to the beach from your room! I'll trade the personal waiter for the fact that I can run back to my room for a book or camera without having to make a 20 minute trek to and from my building. So like others, I bought myself a big mug from Walmart, had the wonderful pool bartender fill 'her up and enjoyed some uninterupted sunning and reading on the beach. So the rooms are a little outdated. Well, honestly, I didn't really notice until the third time we went and had read reviews regarding it. The only thing I can say is that whoever is noticing this that much is obviously spending way too much time in their room! I, on the other hand am up at 7, eating my breakfast and scoping out my palapa on the beach and am usually out until sunset where the only thing I care about is getting my daughter's dvd setup, my pictures for the day downloaded on my computer and grabbing a few drinks before I settle in on that wonderful hammock. The bed is comfortable so as long as I get a good nights sleep, I'm good to go. There are so many other things I could go over about this hotel but the main point I am making is don't come here if you want the luxurious, all-inclusive resort hotel experience that some of the bigger ones can offer you. You will just be disappointed. But if you want a nice, comfortable, easy going, laid back vacation spot where you won't be overrun by kids and singles and a million people trying to get the best spots on the beach. If you want to enjoy your time doing what you want on your schedule and don't want to walk a block just to get to the beach in the first place.

That being said, it wasn't our first time staying at one, far from it, but probably the worst one. GCB is an older hotel. The first thing is obviously the construction going on around it. 5th Avenue is still be developed and they are about a 15-minute walk from the true 5th Avenue (shops, restaurants, etc). The rooms have motion sensors for the air-conditioning, which makes sense. But, at night, when you're sleeping and not moving, well, nothing is being sensed so you have to constantly wave/flap your arms so it gets cool again. Ridiculous. I felt like I was having a bad dream. Never got a good night's sleep because of it. The other thing about an all-inclusive is the activities. Because GCB is small, there weren't many, especially when it rained. You just kind of go to your room, flap your arms and watch TV. BORING. Also, there should be a lot of food choices. There are not and the food is terrible. Might as well go to town (5th Ave.) for a $5 cab ride and eat either authentic cuisine or have Subway, Burger King, etc. Shop at Lacoste, American Apparel, Diesel, etc. OH, and to have your room cleaned, you have to place something on the door. Aren't rooms cleaned every day at hotels? I don't recommend staying here especially if it isn't your first time at an all-inclusive. You'll see what I mean as you'll be the last stop coming from the airport and get to see all of the other great all-inclusives.

Well If you are like me, I read the reviews everyday like an obsession, hoping that someone would leave a review that would set my mind at ease. Well here it goes I can not set your mind at ease I can only tell you that a vacation is what you make it. Because of everything I read in the reviews I was not freaked out at the ride to the hotel, I looked at it as I was not downtown. The walk is not really that long to 5-avenue we walked the beach stopped at the first bar and had a drink., then walked through 5th avenue. As far at the ac in the rooms I am assuming that in October it is not as hot as summer and our ac worked above and beyond our expectations (way too cold). As far as the buffet everything was good, but may have lack a large selection. I can pretty much say I did not go hungry, The snack bar is awesome and we ate most of our lunches there. Ok here is the big one the boats omg I never smelled diesel want to know why, they are not diesel boats lol If I ever smelled a fume it was mostly food occasionally there was a gas smell but not ever enough to complain about. I really thought the boats looked cool out there. If your customer rep is lomas travel, Andres Gongora, He is there for you even if he is not your rep still talk to him he is great. Our soul reason for our vacation is it was our 1st anniversary and my 40th b-day. We knew we wanted to do some fun things so we went and talked to him, We ended up doing Cosmel and Excert I loved Excert. He made sure we knew when we need to check out and when our pick up to airport was. He is awesome I think the best part of the vacation was that this is a small hotel and since we were here for 8 nights we seen people come and go but we met some great people. Frank and Michelle, Dee and Ginger, and Julie and Barry. I really hope we all meet up again. The entertainment staff was ok the professional shows were better. The boys at the pool bar get my best rating they were great and I don't care if you tipped or not they were great. My Husband and I tipped very well but was not pressured to at all. To sum it up, I could find things wrong with the five star hotels that we have stayed in as well as this one. I guess I just remember why I am down there and who I was with and all the great friends I met while there and everything seems ok I repeat this statement a vacation is what you make it.

The resort was nice, but there are definitely a few problems. The weather wasn't great, but I can't blame them for that. Overcast and rainy most of the time - wouldn't go south in October again. First of all, the food was terrific in the Buffet, the snack bar and the Italian restaurant - we never made it to the Mexican restaurant. The room-service menu in the room was very, very limited, but at the front desk they had a much bigger menu - I suppose you had to go there to order room service? Not sure about that, never used it. The shows were fun, tho not too professional - they kept me laughing. The lobby bar doesn't have a fan and definitely needs one - it got hot there! The rooms were clean and nicely kept - although the beds were way too hard. The pool is beautiful and the bars are well-stocked. The hot tubs were not hot at all - cold actually. And the resort does not have a spa - only massages, nothing else that a spa usually offers. There are a lot of boats moored off of the beach, which is unsightly but not too bad. You can always walk 2 mins in either direction and there are no boats. We found that the bartenders, waiters/waitresses, hosts, desk staff, maids - everyone was very polite, pleasant and very helpful. If you approach them with a smile you always get one back! There are three main problems: 1. The picture of the resort that is published is VERY misleading - the resort is no longer surrounded by jungle. Playa del Carmen is growing and it's growing all around Grand Coco Bay! There is constant construction happening for new condos to the right of the resort (looking down to the water from the lobby). It starts early in the morning and once it wakes you up, there is no going back to sleep. It is really annoying. Also, if you are an afternoon napper, like I am - forget about it! The desk staff should NOT put anyone in any rooms on that side of the resort - I don't understand why they did!!! 2. Friday afternoon the locals arrive - in hoards. At least six people to a room in my estimation, and mostly kids. They were so loud!!! My goodness, what a headache I had. The adults sit and stare at you like you're a exhibit in a show (I'm not making this up) and the kids, well some just couldn't open their mouths without screaming about something. And one of these families had a room right next to ours. Friday evening in our room, all we could hear was the pitter-patter of little feet running up and down the hallways and kids knocking on all of the doors and running away, screaming with laughter! 3. The pool has an activities end and a quiet end - but the quiet end is right by the kiddie section with the screaming toddlers!!! I mean, this was getting to be too much. So, I had a choice - sit on the beach and listen to boats, sit by the activities area and listen to loud music and voices, sit by the quiet area and listen to children screaming, or sit my in room and listen to the construction.... I think you get my point? I don't know why they didn't put guests with children on the right side of the resort - they never slept past 7 am anyways, and their yelling drowned out the construction - and put guests without children on the other side!!!

First \u2013 my boyfriend & I have done a lot of traveling, so we have a good idea on what to expect. This will have been our 3rd time to the Mayan Riviera, we\u2019ve been to Grand Cayman, Florida, Jamaica, and other parts of the Caribbean & the US. We\u2019ve stayed at the Barcleo & the Iberostar Maya in the Mayan, which are 5 stars, and knew before we even booked the Coco Bay that there would be no comparison\u2026.Coco Bay is definitely not a 5 star resort \u2013 but read on for the good & the bad. First Impression Yes, everyone is correct \u2013 you drive through what seems to be a \u201csketchy\u201d area when you\u2019re driving to the resort. But also, keep in mind \u2013 this is the outskirts of Playa Del Carmen, the town on Mexico. It\u2019s not the \u201chood\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s just different from the city like we\u2019re used to. This is Mexico, everyone! The cities are going to look different from what we\u2019re used to, remember that! Check in was a breeze, the front desk clerk was very friendly. I had emailed the hotel ahead of time and requested a king sized bed with water and pool views. We got two double beds, and could have switched to a room with a king, but we had one of the best views of the ocean \u2013 we saw the whole resort, the pools, and the beach/water from the deck. Rooms The rooms are very basic \u2013 not like fancy 5 star resorts. But they\u2019re clean, our AC blew ice cold, and the beds weren\u2019t as hard as the other two resorts we\u2019ve stayed at, which was a plus \u2013 those that have visited Mexico before, know that most resorts have rock hard beds! Our deck was a good size as well. A couple of downsides to the room \u2013 our mini fridge was never stocked, which we thought it would be (if you stay in an ocean front room, you get it stocked every 2 days, we found out later), the water pressure in the shower was very poor so we usually had baths, and our TV screen went red a lot (we like to watch TV for 20 minutes or so before bed). Beach The beach here is GORGEOUS. YES, there are boats! But really \u2013 they didn\u2019t bother us at all. They were out at least 20 to 30 feet from the shore and spread out. There was no gas fumes (perhaps this is a psychological thing for people?), and when they left & came back, they were careful to drive slowly. The water is clear clear clear and the color is gorgeous \u2013 definitely that turquoise color that the Caribbean is so famous for. Hardly any rocks in the water, and powder soft sand which was groomed each morning. The snorkelling in front of the resort is great as well. You can rent gear for free through the hotel and there are many fish out front, especially around the anchors where the boats are. If you swim out about 15 minutes, you reach a long reef that\u2019s full of fish \u2013 some people saw sting rays & barracudas, and there\u2019s lots of colourful tropical fish. Pool The pool here is great. Clean, nice and cool, lots of loungers. Some have complained that if they sat at the swim up bar, no one would serve them unless they got out of the pool and around to the other side. We were always served from the water. Staff Yes, there is a bit of a language barrier with some of the staff \u2013 many of you have complained about that. In the other resorts we have stayed at, everyone pretty much spoke perfect English but hey \u2013 again \u2013 we\u2019re in Mexico! We can\u2019t expect people from Germany to come to Canada & complain that we don\u2019t speak German, right? The same goes for down there. So try to stop being so ignorant and remember, you\u2019re in another country! The staff that doesn\u2019t speak English as well still tries hard to communicate with you, and actually would ask us the English words for certain things sometimes. I found all the staff friendly \u2013 maybe those of you that found them to be rude, were rude to them? You have to give a little to get a little, in my opinion. We treated them well and they treated us well in return, with our without tips (but we did tip a lot while there, they work hard and they deserve it). I think the best example of the staff was when about 15 of us went out to the reef to snorkel. We all thought it would be a good idea to go around to the other side of the reef, and we ended up out there pretty far and the waves picked up a bit. One of the guys from the staff swam out to make sure we were all okay to snorkel with us and guide us around. We both got massages on the beach, $40 each for an hour, and they were the best massages we\u2019ve ever had. We felt like we were walking on air afterwards. Food & Drinks This is where the resort lacked. We both knew ahead of time that the food wouldn\u2019t be as good as our previous resorts, but we were both still really disappointed. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 there were some good things about the food. The omelettes in the morning were fantastic (I miss them already), and the juice at breakfast was all fresh squeezed. Breakfast we never had a problem with. Lunch at the buffet was hit and miss \u2013 the fish dishes were always great and fresh but we found everything else bland. The snack bar had good pizza and my boyfriend loved the cheeseburgers. Dinner at the buffet was okay \u2013 there were different themes each night (Italian, Caribbean, Grill, etc) \u2013 but again, we found a lot of the food bland or dry. The Italian restaurant had the best food \u2013 fresh bread, good soup, the parmesan chicken was good and so was the lasagne. But again \u2013 dishes were a bit bland. The Mexican restaurant was a disappointment, which surprised us because you\u2019d think that if anything, it would be the best. I had an upset stomach for the majority of the trip and even spent one night violently throwing up. I\u2019ve never had this problem while travelling \u2013 and because of this, we\u2019ll stay at only a 5 star from now on. My boyfriend had no problems so perhaps it was just something I ate once, or it affects people differently. As for the drinks \u2013 you sort of have to try different ones. The pina colodas & daiquiris were syrupy tasting, so we stayed away from those. The Miami Vices, Blue Lagoons & Riviera Maya drinks were the best ones. Activities/Shows/Misc Notes The shows in the evenings were entertaining \u2013 we saw the Michael Jackson show and the Latino dancing. We tried scuba diving in the pool. We painted our own ceramics beside the pool (extra cost, but it was fun & a good keepsake). If you want to walk to town, it takes about 20 to 30 minutes down the beach to the right (depending on how fast you walk). Or it\u2019s a $4 cab ride into town. Always ask how much it is to get to a destination before getting into the cab \u2013 a lot of the taxi drivers charge people more if they don\u2019t do that. We ate at La Parilla one night in downtown Playa & it was great. We also went to the Blue Parrot one night for the fire show \u2013 and ladies drank free till 2am. The fire show is definitely a must see. All in all, it was a great trip for the money (less than half of what we have paid before). We met some great people (hi to Dave & Sara from Michigan & Aaron and Peesay from North Carolina) If you go on a vacation with high expectations and a bad attitude, you\u2019re going to have a bad time.

There was 6 of us, three couples, and we stayed for two weeks. I would have to say after reading others reviews that they are making this hotel out to being a dump which it is not. The hotel is located in kind of a \"ghetto\" area, but it is only because the area is not developed yet. The hotel grounds were beautiful, the rooms were ok, they could have been a little more kept up but how much time do you really spend in your room?? The boats out in the water in front of the beach was not nearly as bad as people claimed, they were just there, the whole 2 weeks I only smelt fumes 1 day for about 5 minutes. The beach was wonderful, the pool was great! The food was good, there was always variety so you could always find something to eat. The bartenders were great, the lobby bartender Carlos is the best!!!! There was a wedding one saturday night, that was really annoying the music late at night and they closed the disco down to only people for the wedding. There was some construction going on next door, that was pretty annoying you can't really sleep in at all b/c they start working at like 6am. We arrived on Sept. 15 which is Mexico's independence day, I would not suggest to anyone to go to Mexico on that day, it was completly crazy and the hotel was packed with people parting everywhere. This was our 2nd trip to playa, and overall I think our trip was good, and we all had a great time. I would say from my experience in staying at 5 star hotels, this is not a 5 star hotel, but it is a great place to go for the money. If your expecting to come to this hotel and be waited on hand and foot, with rooms with upgrades and high end things this is not the place for you. If you are looking for an low key hotel, to have a good time at, and are not expecting everything to be perfect this is the place for you.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and very friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "KCCDallas_TX", "ReviewID": "UR20480629", "Content": "I have been to several resorts in Cancun and the Riviera Maya and must say this is one of my favorites.

My biggest compaint was that we had an oceanside room and 2 nights before we were supposed to leave, They had a wedding on the beach. The DJ proceeded to blare the \"thump thump\" music until after 3 am. I have no problem with people wanting to have a good time but when you have to be up early for a tour, the next morning, it is kinda hard to go to sleep when you have a concert blaring outside my window. I went down on 4 different occasions to ask them to turn it down and my requests were denied. I know that there were children staying in that hotel and I am sure that their parents were not happy. I understnad wanting to have a good time but they could have turned the music down some or they could have moved the speakers away from the rooms. I suggested both of these ideas but neither one was accepted. Needless to say, we only got about 4 hours of sleep that night. We were partially compensated for our trouble but not enough to my satisfaction. I went to Cancun 4 years ago and stayed at the Costa Real.

We were a group of 9 in our twenties from Vancouver, BC. I as well read a lot of negative reviews and was quite nervous as I was delegated to choose the hotel for our group, but everything turned out fairly well. I am ready to leave a really long and detailed review! A little background of my travel experience so you can gauge my opinions a little better - I've traveled to Puerto Vallarta 2 summers ago and stayed at the Royal Decameron, a 3.5 star hotel. I've also stayed at a 200square feet space in NYC, and 3-5 star hotels around the world. Since we were a fairly large group, I booked with grand coco bay because it is a smaller hotel. When I was at the R. Decameron I disliked having to walk for 5mins to get to anywhere. Grand Coco bay was also walkable distance to 5th ave and I wanted to save us the trouble of needing a taxi to get there and back. We were greeted warmly at the reception and was given wet towels and wine. The lobby won't wow you, and neither will the room. Very average. Among the 9 of us we got 4 rooms (2 couples, 3 guys and 2 girls) One of the couples got a room with some ants in the bathroom, but was able to switch to another one the next night, however that room had a bit of a leaky a/c. All the other rooms were fine. The 3 guys shared a room and they claimed the cot was too soft and uncomfortable. I found the mattress to be a little too hard for my liking however my friend who likes hard beds really enjoyed it. The a/c is sensor activated, so it goes on and off and doesn't really regulate in a way that would like. If there was one thing that I wish was better it would be the rooms. It just comes off looking kind of old and out of date. The a/c not cold enough during the day, and too cold at night. Oh well, we didn't fly all the way to spend all of our time in our rooms anyway! In terms of cleanliness, every night and morning we see their staff cleaning everywhere. The maids were also very quick with making our room every morning. (Even when I had forgotten to tip the first night) Since the hotel is somewhat dated, it might give the impression that things are dirty, but in fact everything was clean and none of us encountered any problems. Yes, there were bugs and insects - in fact there was a huge cockroach in our room under the dresser (that we know of!) But what can you expect? It's a hot weathered country, the complex is surrounded by grass, sand and beach, there bound to be critters running about. But it's definitely not because the hotel is dirty and it's not to the point where they are everywhere. That being said I am not a fan of cockroaches, and as a deterrent we always left our bathroom light on. Never know if they decide to pop out from nowhere! There is also a very skinny but shy raccoon that comes out at night. Some people complained that the staff were rude. I do not agree. They have a lot of work to do and would never finish if they had to stop and say hi to everyone who passes by! Of all the times I initiated a greeting they always smiled and said hi back. Now the beach! Having been to PV (murky water, dark sand, rough water), I can really appreciate the white sand, blue water kind of beach! The water was generally calm and easy to float in. There are indeed lots of boats in front of the beach, but they don't occupy the entire beach front. In fact if you swim out just a couple meters over to the left of the boats, it's a very very long stretch of open water, so I don't know what people are complaining about? Having to swim a few meters to the left? None of us in our group smelled gasoline either, must be psychological for some people. It is really a gorgeous beach! The pools were fun and a good alternative to the salt water. There were also a couple of hot tubs to wind down in. We were not expecting to be waited on and in fact enjoyed taking the little short walks to get our own drinks. We brought our own thermo mugs which kept our drinks nice and cool most of the time and reduced the need to refill constantly. Bartenders were nice in general and staff all around don't pressure you into tipping. As for the restaurants, the a la cart menus were quite nice. We didn't mind the buffet either. They make really good omlettes for breakfast in the morning and the watermelon juice was THE BEST! (that's what I miss the most actually!) Service was always good and prompt. The snack bar was fun! Their tortilla chips were amazing, and their burgers were so soft and delicious... I miss the snack bar! The entertainment staff on the resort were also really nice. They recognized us easily because we were such a huge group and always tried really hard to engage us, making sure that we were having a good time. We rented for free, snorkeling equipment (brand new!) from the resort and snorkeled out to the reefs. It was a good experience and prepped us for snorkeling at the Xcaret a few days later. We also rented bikes (free) to ride around the area. My friend and I rode into Playa Del Carmen....but don't do it! We got stopped by the police telling us we were not supposed to bike on 5th ave. So we biked back on 10th ave instead. We were also a huge fan of their ping pong table, we occupied it most of the time. Playa del carmen IS walkable distance from the hotel. This made it very convenient for our group as there were times when some people wanted to get out for a walk and it was there for us to go to. We walked there and in general found things to be very expensive. They have mostly western chained stores (american apparel, diesel, etc) that are even more expensive than back home so don't expect to be finding deals. We did buy some luchador masks which are quite funny. So we walked most of the way on 5th ave and decided to cab back to the hotel because it was so hot. We were very lucky to have a van stop to pick us up, which fit all of us perfectly. We got to talk with the taxi driver and got a very good price for going to the Chichen Itza, which we ended up going to the next day, and we also called him again to take us to the Xcaret. He was such a nice guy, very trustworthy and brought us to a local liquor store (Covi) to buy tequila (much cheaper than buying from 5th ave) I took his business card so if you want his contact you can message me. The sports bar at night is a little quiet but we were there almost every night. (we're not clubbers and didn't want to go all the way into Cancun) Most of the time it was occupied mainly by us. Although we did have a lot of fun singing karaoke and drinking shots like silly. The bartender there was such a great guy! He made us crazy drinks. Some of the entertainment shows at night were quite amazing. They put in a lot of effort and while it's no vegas style type of shows, enough quality to entertain you. I can see how certain ones can come off being cheesy (especially the comedy one!) but hey, have a couple of tequila shots and just enjoy yourself! Overall it was a great experience! I would say, if you like having a luxurious room, being waited on, and the feeling of being in a grand and new hotel, Grand Coco bay is not for you. But if you want a smaller, more cozy type of hotel with friendly staff, good food, and a great beach (that you can access without a 5min walk or taking a shuttle), for the money it's a great little place. We left a big tip for all the staff on the last day! :D I would recommend this place to people who can tolerate a very average room, and those who are looking for in-house clubbing/partying.

We booked are pak thru Orbitz (only 1120.00 for the both of us for hotel and airfare) we opted for not all inclusive due to the poor review the food got at this hotel (the food was actually great!)and the fact that we were close to 5th Ave. (we are all of the restaurants/bars/shops are located) We also booked our transportation thru Orbtiz (90 bucks r/t, totally worth it) RIDE TO THE HOTEL: Its about 45 mts from the airport, you are on the main hwy and then you make the left hand turn onto where our hotel is located. DONT GET SCARRED!! You do drive thru what may seem like the \"hood\" but its okay. . . then the hotel is at the end of the strip. Completely secluded from the \"hood\" (if you been to the caribbean before is not like you never seen before) ROOMS/HOTEL PREMISES Rooms are clean and comfy. Great view of the pool area or ocean. They keep the hotel nice and clean 24hrs. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. You ask for something and they deliver. POOL/BEACH Both gorgeous. The pool was really relaxing so what the hot tub. The beach was nice and clean. YES THE ARE TONS OF BOATS IN THE WATER AND THE FUMES MAY GET A BIT TOO MUCH BUT ITS NOT THAT BAD!! Take a stroll toward the right of the beach and walk all along the strip to the other side. The good thing about Playa is that the beach is public. The beach walk down is awesome, and the water is much niecer and there are no boats in the area and its not a far walk. RENTALS ON THE BEACH AT THE HOTEL ARE FREE FOR THE 1ST HR. go kayaking or snorkeling. . . . FOOD. . . GO ALL INCLUSIVE!! the food is was great!!! I have no idea why people were complaining about the food. It is not A FIVE STAR HOTEL!! I am a picky eater and the food was fabulous. GREAT bfast. Fresh Fruit!! But if you opt for a la carte, its not expensive either. DRINKS, nicely spiced if you ask. Also, we did the ROMANTIC DINNER!!! 98 dollars for 2 pp. When I tell you it was breathtaking, on the beach at night, the food was amazing, the service was great!! Nothing like having your own private waiter, while having dinner on the beach, looking at the stars. we had the sirlion stk (and it was juicy and tender) and the shrimp with steak. . . its worth every penny and the experience is unforgettable. EXCURSIONS. . . We booked our execursion thru the hotel since we were only there for 4 full days, we did only one execursion a 3 in 1. ATV, SPEED BOAT, SNORKELING, WITH MEALS/DRINKS. must do!! plus the staff was great and the food was yummy!!! 5TH AVE. . .. Okay, it is not walking distance from the hotel. Take a cab for 4 bucks! Have the driver drop you off in the middle of 5th ave. You can walk it up and down. The strip is full of restaurants/bars BUT THE STORE OWNERS WILL HASSLE YOU THE ENTIRE TIME YOU ARE THERE!!!! Put your game face ON! And if you want to enjoy the strip ignore the constant sellers harrasing you. Other then for that, 5th ave is really cool! RESTAURANTS OUTSIDE OF THE HOTEL: La Casa del Agua, amazing!!!! great food, great service, great atmosphere. seafood is yummy! El Fagon (its a local spot, when I say local i mean LOCAL) Good food and cheap!!! WAYS TO SAVE: There is a Walmart in town, stack up on goodies, especially if you are not all inclusive. The exchange rate varies depending on where you go, therefore, change your money at a local bank. Carry tons of change for tipping (they are big on tips) Check out 5th Ave and bargain on your items.

I've seen all types of hotels, and this was exactly what I was expecting. A great value for the money. My husband and I have two kids, one 12 and the other turned 1 on the trip. We were planning to do a whole lotta nothing, hanging out in the pool, and at the beach. We didn't want to go into town, or shop, or do a lot of touristy things. We did go to Xcaret park (recommend this highly) for 4 hrs one day so my older child could swim with the dolphins again. And went snorkling out of Puerto Adventuras another day. Let me tell you a secret. You can rent a private boat (think nice, new - $70K speed boat) for $160/hr and a capitan will take you to the same reef the huge catamaran operations go to. But you can do it in 2 hrs and with a private guide. The catamarans take up to 80 people at a time, and they move slow, so the 5 hour trip can actually be done in 2. Have you ever snorkled with 80 people on the same reef? We had 6 people, so it turned out to be $62/person for 2 hrs (although he stayed out closer to 3 hrs for same price). That's cheaper than the catamarans and I wouldn't take the baby on that tour. My mom, aunt, husband's mom, grandma, sister, and brother in law all met us at the same hotel and we had a blast. The buffet is open for breakfast lunch and dinner. I was always able to find something I liked. Bfast: They have a huge assortment. If you feel like a bowl of cereal, yogurt, tons of fresh fruit, and juices, they're there. If you feel like a made to order omlette (my recommendation) or sunny side up egg, they'll make it for you on the grill. If you want any of the assorted other choices, french toast, pancakes, chilaquiles, beans, potatoes, sausage, etc - they're all there for the taking. Lunch: Didn't make it to the buffet but once, when I had a wonderful filet of fish (grouper, local), rice, and a salad. Otherwise, I always ate at the snack bar - quesadillas. The hot dogs/hamburgers/ribs at the snack bar aren't very good. The pizza was OK. They have ice cream cones, and will make sandwiches - ask to see the menu for choices. The baby always napped then, so I didn't eat lunch much since I was in the room. Anyway, the breakfast kept me full until dinner at 6:30pm. Dinner: Every night is a different theme: Mexican, Chinese, Italian, Caribbean, etc. My favorite was Mexican. But beware, no burritos here! These are delicious traditional dishes from around the country. Might I suggest the local fare - seafood! It's fresh. Many good choices. My least favorite was the chinese. Lots of fried stuff, and nothing really appetizing. A good night to make a reservation at one of the two upstairs menu restaurants - Mexican or Italian. You must make the reservation EARLY in the am of the day you want to go. The set times fill up fast (6:30-7:30-8:30-9:30). I had grouper Yucatan style at the Mexican restaurant, and Chicken Parmasean at the Italian. Both were good, but I liked the Italian more. The beach, and the boat issue. This was a non issue for me. If you wanted to see a \"virgen\" beach, you could just walk south 5 minutes to get away or better yet, stay in Tulum. I liked that the beach kayaks were free/included. They also had wave runners for rent. Cons: I was a little bummed that the pool closed at 8pm though, since it was hot even at night. But they do keep the hotel clean and relatively quiet. Great for families. Not much of a spa as advertised on the website. They had massages on the beach ($40/1hr), but I prefer spa treatments instead. People are right, hold on to your wash cloths. The maids don't replace them unless you ask, just the towels. Also, take care with the beach towels, a lost one will cost you $30. After checking out of the hotel, stay in the pool if you can. The lobby is HOT and we waited 2 hours for our tranfser to arrive by appointment, and it was hard with the baby. A do-over would have been to bring bags to lobby, stay in the pool and just get dressed before our ride. We were too hot. Hints: Try to speak Spanish. Remember, Mexico is not an extension of the USA. They're happy to hear you butcher their language, as a matter of fact, they feel it's respectful to try. Tip people. All-inclusive doesn't mean that you don't tip. You'll be treated very well if you do. Some suggestions: (remember 10 pesos is roughly 1 dollar, 50 = 5 dollars, 100 pesos = 10 dollars, etc) Maid: 10-20 pesos/day Bell boy: 30 pesos Bartender: 10 pesos/drink or 30 for an evening Server: 40-50 pesos per dinner (they'll make sure your water and drinks are refilled, and your plates are cleaned promptly. We made friends with ours the first night, gave 100 pesos and asked his work schedule so we could ask for him - he remembered our names, and every time we showed up, he rushed to greet us and took care of us). Tour operator: snorkeling guide/boat operator - 100-200 pesos Taxi drivers need no tip, unless they wait for you to run into a store, go above and beyond, etc... Things to see: Cozumel - It's only $20 round trip to take the ferry from Playa del Carmen. Note: this place is known for what's UNDER THE WATER, not on the island. If you're a diver, I don't need to tell you about it, you already know. If you're not, this is the best place to snorkle and see underwater life. It's the 2nd largest barrier reef in the world and extends to Belize. Aside from the \"other side of the island\" there's not much to see on land. The east coast is undeveloped (no electricity/street lights) and aside from a couple eateries and ATV jungle tours, there's nothing but beach. The Eastern most part of Mexico, close to Cuba. Don't rent a scooter, get a convertable bug to go around the island, MUCH safer. For free & wonderful snorkling (my recommendation) , ask a taxi driver to take you to hotel Plaza las Glorias, and go to the pool. It's on the reef and you can enter safely here - they have a deck with ladders. There's also a good restaurant there. Tulum - definitely worth the trip. Never hurts to get a little culture, right? Xcaret - beautiful, and same as above. It's part zoo, part theme park (eco-archeological), and also just a really beautiful location on the coast. Plan on spending the whole day here, and I recommend getting the ticket which includes the buffet, because food adds up here. Swim with dolphins, dive, snuba, snorkle, see Mayan cultural shows, see animals, shop, etc. Snorkling near Playa del Carmen - Akumal reef out of Puerto Adventuras (25 min taxi ride south to port, 20 min boat ride to reef).

The food was excellent in the Mexican restaurant--we never ate at the Italian. The banquet dining was good...not spectacular...but definately what I exptected and I would put in the same caliber as a Carnival Cruise buffet (which I've been on). The breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets were plentyful and a good mix of cuisines. I felt they were trying to cater to a mix of people, but we are average meat and potatoe gals and found more than enough to eat at every meal. The staff was freindly. The entertainment staff on the beach during the day tryed to keep you moving--but not in an annoying way. The night time entertainment was fairly dissappointing...but we were not wanting to stay around in the evening anyhow. We met two other families that had 17 year old children. The mix of people was really nice--no crowds!...the resort had a quiet with no hustle bussel feel. The walk getting around was minimal--which I liked! There were only a very few small children. The pool and hot tubs were clean. Outside Grand Coco Bay, we did an ATV/Cave excursion--best money spent!!! A must do if you go--$60/per person for 3.5 hours! Finally...I want to say...no matter where you choose to stay...the 5th avenue and little town of Playa del Carmen is so so nice!! In the day...the shopping and browsing is charming.

This was our first time visiting Mexico, will returned but not to a 3 star hotel. As we approach our hotel destination we were alarmed and almost afraid of the surroundings where the resort was located. Inside the hotel we were greeted by the concierge with champagne and a welcome package which includes a 15minutes lecture about time shares. Before you book your reservation to Grand Coco Bay, please be aware of the following. There is a mini-bar which includes 4 sodas and 2 bottles of water, which is given as a complimentary service for the first day. You have the option to pay to refill every day. There is also a $21. fee for a safe to lock away your documents. We advise you to purchase your tours from your tour guide and not from within the hotels. We were amazed to find out that the package we choice to go on as part of our tour, did not include pick-up and drop-off, we had to find our own transportation. And there was no record on file of us leaving the resort because we choice that particular package, which was much inexpensive, but was almost the same as the expensive ones. The food was ok, almost the same thing every morning, mexican night was excellent. The menu's doesn't change in the restaurant, limited choices to choose from. The pool area is gorgeous, it is the exact picture images as shown on the website. The beach is loaded with boats and fisherman. As you enter the beach you can smell the gasoline from the boats. I suggest you walk 100 feet further and enjoy a much clearer and cleaner beach. The entertainment staff are excellent at night with their shows stopping original performances. Excellent work guys. Don't forget to bring your mosquito's repellent. \"You obsolutely get what you pay for\". Grand Coco Bay resort is good for a large family who's looking for somewhere inexpensive and can speak spanish. The great 5th Avenue, totally expensive.

It was not the place that I thought it would be. If I had been in Florida and had a rental car I would have cancelled my reservation and drove down the road and found a nicer place, and there are nicer places. If I had never been to the Caribbean before I would have probably enjoyed myself better. On the way from the airport we stopped at some really nice resorts in the middle of the jungle that were very impressive and got our expectations up and then after you drive through the depressed neighborhoods (hood) and saw the GCB it was a real disappointment. I will start out with the positives: 1. The price was cheaper than some of the other resorts (you get what you pay for). 2. The majority of the resort was clean, except for a few hallways were the maids had hid some trash. 3. The pool bar was nice, and the drinks were nor too bad. I stuck with cold fruity drinks because it was so hot. The lobby bar was the best. 4. The beach is close and the resort is small so you do not have to take a tram to get from one area to another. 5. The hotel is about a 30 minute walk to 5th avenue. Now the negatives: 1. I would not recommend this resort in the summer. The air conditioning (A/C) in the rooms was just above sweating temp. You can not adjust the room temperature, in fact I talked to a couple at the pool and they said that their A/C was set with a motion detector so at night when they were sleeping the A/C did not come on. They argued with the hotel staff and on the last night of their stay they were finally able to over-ride the controls. The lobby and the buffet area was not air conditioned either. They depended on the ocean breeze to cool the place. The majority of the windows in the buffet area did not open so you could not get the breeze even if it was there. I felt the whole time I was there the only place that I could cool off was the pool with a drink in my hand. You could tell that the hotel management was trying to save some money on A/C. 2. The beach had 100 plus lounge chares but only about 5 thatched umbrellas. If you wanted some shade to get out of the 100 degrees temp you were out of luck. If we got up early enough we could find some shade near the pool. 3. The boats moored outside the hotel were not that bad of an eye sore, it was the fumes from the diesel engines that was bad. As the other reviewers said, the GCB was the only hotel as far as you could see that had boats moored on the beach. The boats moored on the beach were not as bad as the locals on the jet skies that liked to play chicken with the people who were brave enough to swim or snorkel near the beach. The hotel advertised that non-motorized water sports were free to guests. The hotel does not tell you that you can only use them for 1 hour for free then it is a 30 dollar fee for snorkel equipment or anything else you barrow from them. It was a ripe-off. Also hold on to your beach towel because when you check out of the hotel you better have the towels with you or your towel card or they will charge you 20 dollars per towel when you check out. The local beach is right next to the hotel, and if you do not mind seeing a few nude little kids swimming or the occasional topples or bottomless sun bather (they were not local). 4. The entertainment at the hotel was lame. The tall guy with the ponytail was not too bad but the rest of the entertainment looked like they made it up as they went. The theater smelled very musty. The resort advertized that this was family entertainment but a few of the skits had a local entertainer who was naked on stage with a sombrero in from and a smaller hat on his rear, which he dropped at the end of the skit to moon the audience. They also had a skit which was suppose to be like the movie sister act, except they had the nuns smoking dope, drinking tequila and one nun was pregnant. I noticed several families leaving at that point. 5. The taxi drivers were an experience. Sometimes the resort had a bell-person at the taxi station that would tell the taxi driver what the fair was from the hotel to where ever you were going, but coming back to the hotel they wanted to charge you 200 to 500 percent more. 6. The food at the buffet was not very good. They basically had the same food every night but they mixed it around and added some rice or other stuff to meet their theme nightly experience. The breakfast was not too bad. We ate lunch at the grill and the stuff that was suppose to be a hamburger was, well I do not know what it was. The specialty restaurants were the best dinner selection, but you had to make reservation early in the morning. The coconut shrimp and the chocolate symphony were good. When you walked into the restaurant, you could see that only half of the restaurant was full. Also men had to wear long pants or they would not serve you. 7. There must be a shortage of wash cloths in Mexico. We tipped our maid in an attempt to get 3 wash cloths for the number of gust in our room and the only night we received some was on the last day. I guess the maid thought she would get a big tip. 8. There definitely is a language barrier at this hotel. I tried for 3 days to get a battery for my TV remote control and could not get one. I am not sure if the hotel staff did not understand any English or they used it as a excuse not to help you. We were sitting in the buffet and a couple sat down to have breakfast. The table that they tried to sit at had a broken leg and the salt shaker fell to the ground and broke, sending big pieces of jagged glass on the restaurant floor. For 30 minutes, I and other gust tried to get the restaurant staff to clean it up but no one would. We finally pushed the glass under the table. None of the restaurant stuff seemed to care that there were kids walking around in flip-flops who could have been cut. 9. The travel people at the resort kept changing the price of the tour packages. If you asked them about the previous cheaper quote, they suddenly lost their ability to speak English.", "Date": "August 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201c2nd stay was just as good\u201d", "Author": "ballarinamom", "ReviewID": "UR18549308", "Content": "We stayed here July 19th- 26th with our 6 yr old daughter. It was our 19th trip to the Playa del Carmen area. Our second stay at Grand Coco Bay. I had become leary after reading several bad reviews but we booked for this trip anyway. We prefer a quiet resort that isn't crowded. We also want a short walk from our room to the bar, pool, restaurant, beach. We want to be able to eat in the ala cart restaurant every night not just one night per trip. This hotel offers it all. We know that because there is a pool bar, there is no poolside wait service. Which is fine with us. We atched them pour drinks and they used a more than a standerd jigger per drink which meant they were not watered down. If you bring a big thermal mug, don't. They will only fill the smaller ones. I woke up each morning at 7 am to make our ressies at the ala cart and went back to sleep. We don't like buffets as we are on vacation and want to be served. We live in San Antonio and travel to various parts of Mexico often. Each region offers different styles of cooking. Don't expect enchiladas and crispy tacos as that is not the way they cook here. Grilled meats like steak, shrimp and fish is what you should expect at a true regional restaurant. Don't look for Taco Bell! The Mexican reastaurant was really good. The tapaquena was one of the best we had ever had and ou DD ordered it every night. We only ate in the Italian once as we preferred the Mexican. Eduardo was awesome!! We preferred the snack bar for lunch as the buffet was different but always the same. There is a sunken cannon just off the beach to look for snorkeling. Go right out from the soccer goal closest to the buffet about 15 ft. You can actually see it from above water as it is so clear. The entertainment staff was freindkly and tried hard. For the partiers, they offered nightly bar crawl trips into Playa or Cancun. Just sign up before 5:00. Great message for $40/ hour. Easy check in and clean rooms.

We stayed at the Grand Coco Bay hotel for 5 nights from June 16-21. Overall - it's just ok. Here are some good and bad aspects of our trip: THE GOOD: Small hotel = less crowded. Room was clean and everything worked. We tipped the maid 10 pesos ($1) a day and she was very appreciative. The beach water was mild in temperature and a little murky - you can't do snorkeling near shore. Water is clearer the farther out you go on the public beach side. Kayak rental is free per hour. We had to insist on 2-hr rental but we got it anyway. We spotted a big sea turtle surfacing for air while kayaking - it was a magnificent sight. 30 min of continuous rowing toward the public beach side will get you to a shallow & rocky beach where you can comb for baby sea urchins, yellow-striped fishes and eel-like transparent creatures. The reception desk was courteous and efficient. The hotel is a short 15-min walk to 5th Avenue. We recommend that you stroll along the beach to town because it's a bit ghetto on the street side of the hotel. You can also take a $3 (one-way) taxi from the hotel main entrance to town. The 5th Ave strip has all the shopping, bar, club and restaurants. They all cater to tourists so expect things to be very expensive. At the other end of 5th Ave is Cozumel Ferry dock. We thought Cozumel look too industrialized so we didn't go there. Ironically, it was the Snack Bar that had the most tasty foods. Not all foods are good but a lot of them are. My portabella mushroom sandwich was wet, soggy and yucky even for a veggie-lover like me. The ribs tasted too sweet and the chicken too salty but the waffle potatoes and nachos with guacamole saved our taste buds. The ice-cream came in vanilla, chocolate, coconut and lime (artificially flavored, of course) but quite decent on the hot days. Walmart is a $3 (one-way) taxi ride away in case you forget something. We accidentally lost our waterproof camera so we bought a replacement here. All pricings are in pesos and they will only accept pesos. The swimming pool is warm and clean but we only dipped in it for 5 minutes because we rather swam at the natural beach. The drinks are very diluted and sweet. I like it because my liver has very little tolerance for alcohol but my fiance was not impressed. We booked an extra snorkeling tour with Best Day Tour for $80/ea. This tour took us to Yah-ku lagoon for snorkeling, some Mayan's cave for swimming, and a private cenotes for diving. We're water-lover so this is fun for us. We didn't like the ridiculously long ride in the van and the tasteless lunch but we enjoyed the activities as short as they may be. Miramar Buffet restaurant served very decent breakfast. Lunch and dinner are tasteless (see below). THE BAD: Miramar buffet foods (including the desserts) really all tasted the same so we grew tired of them as soon as the second night. Thankfully, there was an abundant of fruit supply (papaya, watermelon, pineapple, cantaloupe, orange) so I didn't mind living off on them. My carnivorous fiance, however, wasn't too happy. We went to the specialty restaurants (Italian & Mexican) every night in hope of finding better foods but we could only say that they weren't worse. The Italian restaurant is only good for its self-served mini seafood salad bar. Entrees and desserts are not tasty. The Mexican restaurant is only good for its Coconut Shrimp with Mango Sauce entree and the Triple Chocolate Symphony dessert. Everything else is mediocre. This is a bit disappointing for us because we expected good Mexican food in Mexico. The presence of the boats that camped around the beach didn't bother us. It's the repugnant odor of their fuel that suffocated us at times. The dinning services @ Miramar Buffet: they were very welcoming on our first night (showing us to our seats, bringing our drinks and clearing our plates) but because we forgot our wallets in the room and didn't tip anyone that night, they pretty much just ignored us thereafter. We didn't realize that tip was required for service with this supposedly tip-included all- inclusive package. A little sad here. We understand that the servers may have been very under-paid so we didn't object to tipping. However, we were disappointed by their drastic change in the attitude that we decided to get our own drinks and not tip any waiter in this restaurant for the remaining of our stay. We noticed that other vacationers at this hotel were also doing the same thing. The mini fridge in the room only had 2 sodas and 2 water. The water is free only on the first day. Mosquitoes here are vicious for international blood - bring your insect repellant. That was enough of Mexico for us.

This was our first time visiting Mexico, and I am not sure if we will return. First bit of advice: BLAZE right past the official looking \"Mexican tourist board\" guys that pounce on you as soon as you pass through the sliding glass doors when you are done with immigration. They look official, but they are the first of many who try to sell you tours and timeshares. DON'T STOP HERE NO MATTER WHAT. Don't give them any money. Keep your head forward and go right outside and look for someone holding your tour company name. If you have our experience, you will wait (outside) for your transfer ride to the hotel for about 1-2 hours. When you ask the tour reps where the van is.....they all of sudden don't understand English. Our tour was with Vacation Express/ Elite tours. We used Vacation Express for our honeymoon to Punta Cana and it went awesome....so it's probably just Mexico in my opinion. We hit \"construction\" on the main road to Playa Del Carmen, so it took us another 1.5 hours to get to the hotel. Thats 4 hours from touchdown to the hotel. You will pass a bunch of nice hotels that have big gates, long driveways into them from the main road.....and you will drive through the Hood' and a construction zone to get to this gem of a hotel. Check in went fast...and we of course were given the pool view room on the construction side, even though we asked for Ocean view. We were then pounced on by tour/ time share seller #2, who was disguished as the hotel \"concierge\". This hotel doesn't have a Concierge.....they work for another tour company who is trying to sell timeshares. The room itself was decent. The mirror had stains from being old, and you have to use the 2-flush method if you go #2 or the toilet will back up. The day we checked out the AC start leaking BAD. The walls are so thin in your room you will feel like your neighbors are in your room with you. And if you are on the construction side....good luck. The buffet was enough to keep you fed, and the service was 99.9 percent good except for the mean waitress that would not let people in through a side entrance when Tropical storm whateverhername was dumping on our hotel. The mexican and Italian restaurants are very good, but you need reservations for them, which you can make at breakfast each morning. But, you will notice that both restaurants are half empty every night....but you need a reservation. Pool Bar........they stick to the letter on when they open and close....and the bar hours are weird. Tips.....even though your agent will tell you that tips are included, they really aren't. They will all hit you up for money...even when the bell boy watchs me carry our two big bags when we were leaving.....then he grabs my wife's carry on purse....and he goes \"Tip!!?\" Nice.... Snorkel tour.......lucky I was a good swimmer. They took us out in some pretty good waves, and a lot of our group were getting fished out with the life preservers. They cancel the trip halfway into it, tell us to wait in the restaurant...which lasts for 1.5 hours....while 5 vans are sitting there......and the drivers are saying they can't leave until 5:30pm. No kidding.......a brawl was about a hair away. When we ask the hotel tour company (who we booked it with) for a partial refund, we get some crap about having to complain within 24 hours...even though they always had somebody in there the next day. Return to airport....van breaks down and we have to pull over and switch to another one. Airport food....don't eat at Guacamole Grill. I have a cast iron stomach and I am still taking a beating internally. Express Class seats......I thought you get served FIRST in FIRST class....except on AeroMexico. We watched in horror as the flight attendants rolled out the food and drink cart, went all the way to the back and got to us last. Nice.....

On the way to the resort from the highway you may doubt from the side street condtions and the construction what kind of place you are going to but you will not be sorry. As soon as you enter, you are greeted by friendly staff, a glass of very nice champagne and are impressed with the open air effect and shining lobby. The resort is very clean, as was our room. Everyday, the cleaning staff are busy making the whole resort shine - very hard working and kind staff in all the various roles. The garden area is small but very pretty and well maintained. You see gardeners everyday, as well. The beach here is exceptional. They even rake the beach everyday to keep it clean from the seaweed, something we noticed other resorts did not do. We found that to be very impressive. It seems less rough too because of the reef that seems to surround the area of the resort. Nice to snorkel to. The boats that moor there don't take away from it either and most of them leave during the day, anyway. As for the food, we thought it was excellent. Even the buffet that other travellers have said was not good, we liked it. Seemed always fresh and very tasty. The staff at the buffet were always kind and hard working. They change themes every night, so watch for your favorite. Other nights, definitely make a reservation for the Italian and Mexican restaurants because they are indeed excellent. We found the Italian to be best, however, for service. The lasagne here was SO GOOD. Every dish from both restaurants is presented so beautifully. Even the salads and desserts look like artwork. We found all the bars to be good. All the batenders were wonderful and made great drinks. The entertainment staff are all excellent and so much fun. You could just stay at the resort everyday, not even go anywhere, and have a great time. They have activities going all day long. I recommend the morning stretching on the beach , the beach volleyball and water aroebics, so much fun. We did, however, go on three tours. I highly recommend the tour to Chichen Itzu as it is very informative. That is if you like to know the history of it. I don't recommend the combo tour to Xel-ha and Tulum. You are not given enough time for both. Xel-ha is awesome and the cost is less it seems just to take a taxi and pay the entrance fee. It is all-inclusive for drinks and food. The Mexican buffet here is amazing. The snorkeling is so cool and the pathways beautiful. The Mayan Adventure was fun, as well. The cave snorkeling is so amazing. The food makes you nervous but we ate it and did not get sick. In summary, if you like a smaller resort where you walk just a few feet to the beautiful white sand beach of this area, you will not be disappointed with The Grand Coco Bay. They really try to make your stay an excellent one. We went on a romantic get away for our anniversary. Next time we are bringing our children and will just stay at the resort the whole time.

I don't know if the resort charges and is making a fortune off of this but on the entire strech of beach, this is the ONLY area with boats anchored. Their anchored 30 yards off of the beach so when your swimming around you have to watch out for them. With all these boats you get to smell the burning oil everytime someone leaves or comes back into the area, which is quite often. The beach chairs are pretty uncomfortable also. They do not recline all the way and if you try to lay the opposite way on your stomach there is a bar that jabs you in the rib cage, stomach or pelvic muscle. If you want to lean back and read a pillow would be useful because of the angle of the chair it gets uncomforable. Otherwise you can slouch but then your butt falls asleep after about ten minutes. I also had a shuttle booked through Best Day, which is the tour company associated with the hotel, headed back to the Cancun airport. I confirmed the return trip with the company when I arrived at the resort. The shuttle never showed up and I had to take a cab to the airport at 5 am which cost me $500 pesos (50american).", "Date": "July 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort St. John, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat time, nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "salemkettner", "ReviewID": "UR17600063", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at The Grand Coco Bay between June 29th and July 6th 2008. Had an excellent time! We chose to stay here because of affordability and location. Here is a breakdown of the main points: Location: 4 dollar cab ride to 5th ave, or about a 15 minute walk. The road leading to the resort seems to have a run down feeling, but the resort itself is very nice. Security was always present. Very safe area. No time share sharks Rooms: We arrived at 3:30 am, therefore we were very tired and just wanted to go to bed. The room we were given had two double beds, and was located on the 3rd floor where the balcony met with a suntanning deck. It was less then desirable, but we were too tired to complain. In the morning, we politely asked to be moved to a room with one bed and in a more private location. The staff were more then happy to oblige and we were moved to a nice sized room with a king bed. Located in a corner, which opened into the garden/pool area. We made sure to tip the maid every morning and also left some candy. Our belongings were never tampered with and our room was always clean. I was slightly annoyed at having to pay for the use of the safe box, but it was a small cost and worth using. The beds were quite comfortable. My husband felt they were a little hard, I found them to be be just right. Staff: All the entertainment staff were great! They do a great job at organizing the various activities through the day and they have very intresting shows they put on at night. They interacted well with the children at the resort and always had smiles to share. The service staff are friendly and most speak english well. If you do a little homework and know some basic spanish before you go, they will appreciate your attempt to communicate in their language. Some of the staff at the buffet speak very little english, but it never presented a problem for us. Smiles and hand gestures are universal! Food: The buffet was above average. Not spectacular, but definatly good. A different theme each night such as Mexican, Italian, Japanese etc. Some items were a little too adventerous for me, but plenty of items to try. Breakfast and lunch buffets offered many choices also. The a la carte restaurants are very good. We ate at both the Mexican and the Italian, but prefered the Mexican restaurant. Our favorite dish was the coco bay shrimp. The snack bar had plenty of choices, and were often open late. I was able to get some food one night at 2 am after returning from downtown. Drinks: Swim up bar seemed to make very weak drinks, and also was not open long. The swim up bar also posted a sign refusing bubba kegs. The other bars made any drink you wanted and they were made with reasonable alcohol. The plastic cups they use are sufficient in size to enjoy a frozen drink before it melts. One of the best drinks we had was called \"Dirty Monkey\". Carlos also makes very good Mai Tais!!! ( just one made me a little buzzed!! lol) Pool: Nice area for kids at one end. Very clean and large enough to enjoy a swim without running into lots of people. Plenty of chairs around the pool, a few with shade. Beach: Gorgeous beach. Nice soft white sand. Swimming was enjoyable right in front of the resort. The boats were there most of the time, but did not affect the quality of the water. No smells or visable pollution. There is a reef a short ways out from the beach, so we snorkled along and saw some beautiful things. Plenty of chairs available. Topless is not permitted as it is a family resort. Nice public beach areas on either side of the resort. Equipment/services: Snorkling gear is included for free, but only for one hour. We used the gear for about 2 hours and didn't get charged for the additional time. wireless internet is available at a cost of 5 dollars/day. We paid once, but continued to get access the rest of the week for free. They have a massage booth located outside. It costs 40 dollars/hour. My husband and I each got a massage. Betty did mine and she was EXTREMELY tough!! It hurt the entire time, and I felt bruised and sore for 3 days. My husband enjoyed his massage done by a different lady. No other spa treatments were available. The hotel has a jewelry shop, and a travel/excursion shop. If you are looking for a lower 4 star resort, this is the place! No big perks, but it is clean and comfortable and in a great location to take advantage of tours and shopping.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "somerdale", "Title": "\u201cWe all Loved Grand Coco Bay\u201d", "Author": "giosomerdale", "ReviewID": "UR17596374", "Content": "We are from South Jersey and have returned from a week stay at Grand Coco Bay.

The beach was awesome and if you walk to the right down the beach a little towards playa del carmen the beach has more waves and awsome for boby surfing. My husband and got a massage on the beach $40 for an hour and the best massage I ever had and believe me I have had very expensive massges. There were great activites during the day for everyone. Water aerobics, soccer, volley ball, a gym, bingo... just to mention a few . The food was good. A lot of choices. We ate twice at the Italian Restaurant and once at the Mexican you need reservations which you have to make in the morning between 7am and 11am try to get there early because the Mexican and Italiant restaurants book up. The people were always happy and willing to help you any way you needed. The drinks were great especially the shots of tequila. Get a CocoLoco delicious. Our kids loved the sports bar which turned into a disco at night they played pool and just hung out with all the kids they met during the day. This was a very nice place, beautiful location and just beautiful weather.

We booked through hotwire and did not have any problems with the reservations. We got a great price on our all-inclusive vacation. This hotel has a great setup with a U-shaped design so nothing is very far away....pool, lobby, restaurants, beach. From what I gather, it was built around 2001. If a big, wide open sandy beach is important to you, then you should definitely consider GCB. The beach is by far the best feature at this resort. We have stayed at the Occidental Grand and the Grand Porto Real resorts and this beach wins in a landslide, its not really even close. The restaurants are good, but the buffet was just OK. The buffet area is nice, but its an open air design, no A/C, but the view looks over the pool and the beach. The Latin or Mexican restaurant has the coconut shrimp that everyone mentions in other reviews below. The Italian restaurant has good food, too....just not that memorable! The lobby bar was my favorite by far. Ask the bartender to make you a caipirinha. Its the signature drink served at Fogo De Chao brazilian chophouses. Its made with rum, sugar cane, and two limes. Its pronounced like \"caprinhe\". The pool bar is the absolute worst. Avoid it unless you are right there with nowhere else to go. The buffet bar is not bad.....they will make you a good drink. MaiTai's are good and my friends liked the Miami vice. The discotheque bar was average, but they will make a good long island tea. on the top level near the disco and restaurants. We had a view of the pool and beacj from our balcony and a view of the beach/jungle on the door side (see pics!). The only problems we had with this hotel were the beach towels, the room washcloths, the room beverages, the average to lousy buffet food, and the cleaning of the bar glasses at the outdoor bars. They give you cards to turn in for a beach towel to use for the day, but they don't have anywhere near enough towels! The hotel was almost half empty when we were there, yet we came to the pool every morning at 8:30 AM....it opens at 8AM and every single day, all the towels were gone! I have some advice for this hotel. Either A): Always keep a number of towels equal to the number of rooms you have times 2.....or B): Always keep a number of towels on hand equal to the number of guests staying at your hotel. This would solve the problems....its nice to have a card keeping your towel reserved, but theres really no point to it if there are only 50 towels or so to be reserved! We got washcloths in our room on the first day, then they were picked up and never replaced. How strange....we thought it was a joke. We also had a mini fridge stocked with a strange assortment of 1 diet coke, 1 fanta orange, 2 bottled waters, and 1 coke. None of these were ever refilled during out week long stay. At other resorts, they refill daily and also include a few beers. The resort says on all the taps that the water is potable, but I think they mean \"mexican potable\", not purified. The water refills by the pool bar and buffet bar are purified and safe, but use bottled water to brush your teeth or drink. The outdoor bars use a tray of this mexican potable tap water to rinse out the glasses....you can rinse out your own at the water refills. Definitely bring your own cup! Other than that the rooms were fine. We stayed on the non-construction side with beach/jungle out our door. tip #1: Its a good idea to call GCB's reservations line at 866-511-6776 2 weeks before your arrival date and again 1 week before your arrival date. Thats what we did and there was no problems with overbooking. tip #2: bring your own cup for the drinks, but not over 24-28 oz. They serve in 10-12 oz cups. tip #3: get reservations for the restaurants at breakfast for that same night. Worked well for us. tip #4: to get to 5th Ave, just walk out the front of the resort, then walk away from the beach for two blocks and then go left three more blocks. When you see the fountain, you are at 5th ave. tip #5: book Xel-Ha online before you go to save 10%. Just pick the day with the best weather forecast. You can rent a car on 5th and drive there easily. This way you get a full 8am to 6pm day at Xel -Ha. If you book through an operator, they will drive you in a big bus and stop at every other hotel in Playa picking up tourists...you will get there at 1pm and then they want to leave at 4:30 so they can drop everyone off again.....nice, 3 hours at Xel-Ha. tip #6: bring anti-diahrea medications. yeah. tip#7: book the zip line tour through alltournative.com. Its such a great time. you get to snorkel, mountain bike, and zip line very close to Xel-Ha. If you know what to expect you will have a great time in Playa, no matter where you stay. We had a blast on our vacation. If you don't mind fetching your own drinks/food, this place is an excellent value. If you want to be pampered or you want some sort of SPA, find another resort.", "Date": "July 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, TX", "Title": "\u201cMy Over-All Experience and Impression of GCB\u201d", "Author": "CandWDiva", "ReviewID": "UR17415216", "Content": "A group of five of us (my sister, me, one of my best friends & her husband and son) stayed at GCB 06/19 - 06/26. We're all in our early 40's, and her son is 19. Just a little background that helped us make our decision and be the basis for the review: Except for my sister, the rest of us have been to Mexico several times, and we've stayed at several different kinds of AI's. About six years ago, my husband and I went to PDC with another couple and stayed at Gran Porto Real. This was my sister's first time to Mexico. We booked our trip through Jay at Grand Travel (www.GrandTravelCruise.com). It was a FunJet trip for three of us, and Sun Country charter for the other two. The rest of this I'll try to break-down by categories, because otherwise this will be way too long for most people. Front Desk / Room - After being delayed at DFW for a couple of hours and a very long bus ride with lots of other \"extremely happy\" Texas folks, three of us arrived at the resort tired and hungry. We were greeted with champagne, cold cloths and the promise of the snack bar being still open. Much better already. Time to explore tomorrow. We found the other two that arrived earlier that day and called it a night. Our room was 2161, and we loved it.. It looked out at the pool and the ocean. The construction never bothered us, because most mornings we were out of the room before they got started. Yes, we had a toilet that you had to jiggle the handle, but we didn't bother to report it, because we didn't find it to be a problem. The room temperature was fine for me, but one of the other rooms from our group stayed warm. The other was very chilled. Be warned - the A/C and lights are on timers. I understand this logic, though, because I imagine it saves them lots of money. My sister eventually moved the sensor, so that all she had to do was raise her arm in the bed. ; ) There was only one night that the noise from the pool bothered us, and that's because of a group of younger kids. Again, we didn't complain, because they were having fun, and it didn't keep me awake. We were surprised that the pool didn't really seem to close (although fairly empty by 10), and they actually let us walk on the beach at night (some resorts don't). I know the couple with us never got their A/C fixed, but it wasn't unbearable. You're really not in your room a lot anyway. Our housekeeper was very pleasant, and our room was always nice and clean. We tipped every day (always asking for more towels), and we never had a problem. The young man with us had housekeeping walk-in on him once with the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, but they immediately closed the door and left. We never had an issue, but we always put our valuables in the safe anyway. Food - Everybody's tastes are different, but I never tried anything that I didn't like. It's not a five star resort, but they do a very decent job with the food. If you went hungry, it was your own fault. Try the different things, and if you like it - get more. Too many people associate with All-Inclusive as a right to be able to waste huge amounts of food. The first night we ate at the snack bar. Not a huge selection at night, but at least they were open. My friend LOVED the chips and pico de gallo, and ate some most every day. During the day, they had a standard menu, but it had several options on it. We ate at the buffet every morning, most afternoons and once at dinner. They did have different theme nights, but there were some basics that were out at every meal. The omelet station wase great for breakfast (be sure to tip!). We ate at the Mexican and the Italian speciality restaurants twice each. The servers here were just awesome, and the food was wonderful. The only thing we found \"lacking\" was the desserts in the Italian restaurant one night. The next time we tried, though, everyone was happy. You need to make your reservations in the morning for dinner that night. We usually ate about 6:30, and we never saw the restaurants full. They got more crowded later. Beach - I read a few reviews that complained about the boats. They never bothered me. One time it was a little over-powering when someone fueling-up a jet ski, but it never bothered my view, my swimming, etc. Walking down the beach one way led to a quieter area, and the other (going towards town) led to several public beaches with more of a party atmosphere. The weekend was definitely more crowded with locals, but it's THEIR beach. We're just borrowing it. We never had a problem leaving our towels and stuff by the pool or in the beach chairs. Shaded palapas were taken-up quickly, but we didn't see anyone wasting them. Even with the volleyball, bachi (?sp) ball, soccer, etc. - it was easy to relax. The water was beautiful! We snorkeled Thursday morning, and we saw lots of fish. My friends scuba dive, and I think they thought the diving was not as good as Cozumel, but it's nice. Definitely watch-out for the mosquitos if you do the cenote diving!! Pool - The pool is awesome! I tend to shy away from the swim-up bar, because those people never seem to leave their stools. That concerns me. ; ) The bar by the buffet is the BEST (they learn your favorites very quickly, especially if you tip). We didn't find the drinks weak, but there is a limited selection. But it's Mexico, and YOU'RE ON VACATION. Again - roll with it. Try a Miami Vice or my personal favoritre - a Blue Hawaiian. There's a water dispenser on the bar, and it always had fresh, cold water in it. Drink plenty. It's easy to get dehydrated doing a lot of nothing. ; ) Activities / Shows - This was an area we all agreed was a problem. They post a schedule, but it's not enforced. There is lots of confusion between the staff as to what is going on which night. For example, we were told Mariachi bands would be in the buffet restaurant one night, only to have it be Asian theme. Volleyball, casino night, karaoke, etc. never started on time. I think this caused people to give-up and do other things. I'm fairly anal retentive about schedules and planning, but when in Mexico, you just have to learn to go with the flow. Othwerwise, you'll just drive yourself crazy. My own opinion is that they spread the staff too thin (they all have multiple roles and responsibilities), and they can only be in so many places at one time. They all work REALLY hard, and I can tell they put a lot of effort into their shows, etc. We really enjoyed the Folklorico show and the different Macho Man contest, etc. we saw. They have some very funny people working for them, and the more the crowd gets into it - the better. 5th Avenue / Town - LOVE this place! Great people watching. Good bargains. Lots to see and do. Be sure to go during day AND at night. Totally different vibe. If you're willing to tip, you'll see monkeys, turtles, parrots, lizards, iguanas, etc. Be sure to check out Big Al & Red Neck Steve's Beer Bucket! We live in the DFW area, and I've been hearing about this new venture for a while (Big Al is a local DJ). It's a little place with great ambiance!! Head upstairs for more room. They're going to be expanding soon, and I think it will only be better. Paloma is a GREAT bartender (very sweet, too)! I spent the night of my birthday there, and we had a GREAT time! Be sure to say hi to Duke (and Jose, the little flirt that he is!) for me!! Summary - While you can't ever be 100% guaranteed of anything, we've kind of learned to weed through the good and bad reviews, picking-out the real problems vs. people's opinions. You can't control the weather, flight/airport issues, other people's reactions to situations, etc. You just buy trip insurance and pray.

The maids did a wonderful job, and we left them a good tip when we left. My only complaint about the room was that the bed was rock hard. I don't know if it was like this for all of the rooms, but ours was definitely not comfortable. But I forgot about this as soon as I got up and walked onto our balcony and saw the ocean : ) The food was good at the buffet...there was a omelett station every morning, and usually some sort of station (pasta, fried rice, etc...) for dinners. I would definitely recommend going to the Italian and Mexican restaraunts because the food is AMAZING!!! Just be sure and make your reservations EARLY, or else you won't be eating dinner until 9:30. One morning we weren't able to make reservations because we had to leave for a tour, and they wouldn't let us in at all that night...no exceptions. We really didn't like having to wait one night for about 30 extra minutes because they had \"too many people\" in the restaraunt....but yet there were several open tables.

I went with my boyfriend and 6 of our close friends (all in our 30's). We had a really great time and the experience at Grand Coco Bay was, for the most part, good. After reading some of the reviews from people who used Hotwire we did call the resort several times before arriving to confirm that we were booked with the all-inclusive package. The good things about Grand Coco Bay were: 1) the beach was beautiful and the boats did not really bother us. We have stayed at some higher-end resorts in Playa that had nowhere near the beach. 2) The entertainment staff was excellent - we took water aerobics with Ricky Hanser(sp?), after he talked us into it, and he is a RIOT! They had daily beach volleyball and soccer that was also a lot of fun, 3) the resort was not overcrowded so we could always find plenty of beach/pool chairs for all of us to sit together. There were kids and teenagers but the resort was not overwhelmed by a bunch of screaming kids so it was still nice for adults with no children. 4) The resort was actually very pretty and small enough that you didn't have to walk forever to get to the pool, beach, bars, or food like you do at the bigger resorts. We also really liked the lobby bar and the snack bar! The rooms were adequate, nothing special - the nice thing is that our rooms opened to the beach on one side and overlooked the pool on the other side. Also, our whole group was able to get rooms right next to each other. The resort is a little less than a mile from 5th Avenue and we walked there most every day. The things we didn't like about Grand Coco Bay: 1) the buffet got old pretty fast as they really didn't change the menu much. We ate at both the Italian and Mexican restaurants and they were okay. We spent the most time just grabbing food at the snack bar. 2) The service at the pool bar was terrible! The drinks were not as good and the staff was not friendly at all like at the other bars. Bring your own cup/mug as we watched the pool bar staff wash the resort glasses in a basin of dirty, slimy water (we all gott a touch of Montezuma's on this trip) 3) I was never able to get a pool towel - every day that I checked they were out. Fortunately, we brought beach towels or we would have been out of luck 4) The room fridge's are stocked with drinks the first day but are never replenished 5) There is no beach bar or drink service catering to the beach. There actually isn't any wait staff at all around the beach or pool areas. It's pretty much a get-it-yourself type of resort unless you go to one of the restaurants. This really didn't bother us too much, although it might have been nice to get a Bahama Mama delivered every once in a while! 6) For some odd reason, after the first day the maid took all of our wash cloths and never brought us new ones 7) the travel agency at the resort was VERY unhelpful when we were trying to get some information on a zip line excursion that we had researched online but needed contact info for. Evidently they are not in the business of helping if they can't make some money off of you. All in all, we had a great time at the resort. It's a great resort if you want an affordable price, a relaxed and fun atmosphere, a nice beach, and no worries about lines or space. We would all stay here again if the price was right. I think it was a good match for a group of adults looking to have a good time. If you're looking for luxury, great service, and fantastic food this is not the place for you. One side note: if you're looking to take a day excursion to Tulum , Xel Ha, or one of the other attractions avoid using the resort \"package deals\". We heard them quote $120/person for transportation and an all-inclusive day at Xel-Ha. We booked Xel-Ha all-inclusive online for $67.50 per person and rented 2 cars for the 7 of us. It came out to $10 per person for all-day car rental. Executive Car Rentals is right on 5th Avenue and you can book a compact car for around $13/day.

June 12-18. From reading all of the reviews, I was very weary of our trip. Once we arrived, we were very impressed and started to feel more comfortable about our vacation. We were greeted with champaign, that was very tasty. The staff were very pleasant, friendly and helpful. A lot of them did speak very little English. I found that the very few Spanish words that I know, came in very useful. The hotel is very clean. Our room was kept clean. We requested a room with two double beds. The beds were very small and barely fit two people. The second night, we ended up pushing the two beds together to make a larger king bed and the three of us slept in that and it worked out great. When we checked in, we had wash rags, but didn't have any after that. The maids always ended up taking the \"do not disturb sign\" for our door. We easily got another one from the front desk. I did leave the cleaning staff a tip. The food was very tasty, but ended up being the same thing every day. I never knew there were so many different ways to make white rice. But everything had good flavor. There was a server named Francisco that was our favorite and took very good care of us. He ended up making a lot of tip money from us and he was very appreciative. We did eat at the Italian restaurant one night and that was good for a change. We also ate on 5th Ave. a couple of times. LaParella had very good comfort food. At the Mimirar Buffet, The FRESH FRUIT was the best. I miss that already. They also have the best custard pie. My youngest daughter and I ate our share. I also miss that. For drinks, they only have one type of Beer DosXX's on tap. The mixed drinks were weak. The entertainment staff was good also. They had activities everyday. The BEST was the Michael Jackson show....We actually thought we were at a Michael Jackson concert. He looked so real....The Comedy show was also funny. The beach was fantastic...Just like the pictures. The sand was powdery and the water was crystal blue. Just like paradise. We also took the ferry to Cozumel. GCB hotel is a 30 minute walk on the beach to the ferry. We also went to 5th Ave. a couple of times. There were all different ages there. Single guys/women, couples (old and young) families with small and older children and lesbians. This hotel is fit for anyone. I would return to this hotel, but I would try something else first.

We did not want a place where we would be waited on hand-and-foot, and would be surrounded by rich folks. We wanted a fun, relaxing, middle class hotel and that is what we got! The drinks were awesome, the food was very good, and the entertainment staff was indeed very entertaining. I would not recomend seeing one of the nightly shows until you have been there for 2-3 days and have had some time to get to know the staff. Their shows are so much better when you know the personalities of the people on the stage. While most of the entertainment and front desk staff spoke english very well, many of the maids and others did not. This language barrier will only frustrate you if you let it. They are more than willing to try to communicate or find somebody who can translate. I actually enjoyed trying to communicate with them using signs and the very few spanish words that I know how to speak. I am still so overwhelmed by the amazing vacation that we just returned from that I can not even begin to descirbe everything in detail.

We stayed in July of 2007, and this was our 8th time visiting Mexico, our 2nd in Playa del Carmen. Firstly, I'm 16 y/o, 15 at the time. I was given an 18+ wristband, for what reason I'm still unsure. I look a lot order than I am, but several other 16/17 y/o that I met were also given the 18+ wristbands. My parents didn't object to it, just told me not to abuse it. The staff was excellent, and were all very welcoming and friendly. I noticed that there were many more male staff members than female, but nonetheless the interactiosn were excellent. The daily activtities that were offered were extremely fun, including water aerobics, beach/water volleyball, water \"Olympics\" games, ping pong tournaments, and so on. The resort itself was nice, the pool being average. The hot tubs weren't actual hot tubs, but they weren't horrible either. It's hot outside anyway, so what's the point of the hot tub? The beach was VERY nice, the water and the beach itself exceptional. There are plentiful beach chairs and tables w/ umbrellas. The water was excellent, as were the beach activites. The food was alright, nothing really exceptional, but if you're hungry late at night, there's not much you can do. I remember my last night I was able to get quesadillas around midnight, but it's rare. The entertainment was also great, there were karaoke nights, poker nights, and so on. My favorite part was the Sports Bar, where I always was guaranteed a great time. Every Saturday, the staff members take visitors into the city to varying clubs, where they stay with you the entire night. The resort itself was close to the city of Playa del Carmen, and my parents walked down there every night. My only complaint was the rooms. We paid about $500 extra for a \"beach-front\" room upon our arrival, but we were actually given a view of the outdoor kitchen and some of the kitchen. The key cards were constantly malfunctioning, and the room itself was alright, but nothing special. There were problems with the running water, and the pressure exerted from the faucets in both the sink and the shower was bogus, sometimes too strong, other times squirting out barely anything at all. Other than that, I experienced an overall enjoyable vacation.

We got an excellent deal through a family member, so we think it was definitely worth it. We really liked the pool and beach. It was really beautiful. It was not crowded which was great, so we always were able to find places to lay down without having to reserve seats with our towels. Also on the left side of the resort there was a very long stretch of beach so you could take a romantic walk along this. The drinks were good. The glasses we were given were not tiny, as we'd expected. My favourite was the margarita, but I loved all of them! The snack bar was also amazing- especially the nachos and pizza. Ice cream was a nice touch too! We did not do the a-la-carte restaurants so can not comment on these. The buffet though was always good- we liked the themes. By the end of the week though I was getting a little tired of this, so definitely go to the a-la-carte restaurants. The breakfast at the buffet was great. The company we booked through was on-site (Go Travel Direct) so we booked our excursion through them, which was convenient. We did Tulum and Xel-Ha in one day, which was good. A full day at either one might have been too long for us. The buffet at Xel-Ha was good, but my boyfriend's stomach did not agree. If you go here you HAVE to snorkel, and bring an underwater camera! 5th Avenue was a few minutes walking-distance away, so shopping was convenient. Be prepared to haggle! You can get some good deals- for example on a ring I talked the guy down from $120 to $40 but changed my mind and walked away. They do not back down unless you make them so if you're not interested be assertive. And they will remember you! We also went to Cozumel to see what this was like and although I'm happy to say I have been there, the shopping at 5th Avenue was better and cheaper. It was a bit of a waste of time. I got a massage on the beach which was also really nice and I recommend this. It was not expensive at all- $30 for 30mins or $60 for 60mins. There were a few negatives. We were on the construction side and we didn't notice this too much during the weekend when we first arrived but for Mon-Fri the jack hammer in the morning was not pleasant. We did not complain but I do recommend you try asking for a new room on the other side, which is what we should have done. My pillow in our room smelt like stale water, which was not pleasant. I ended up covering it up with some tops. I was hoping that after housekeeping was in this would be fixed, but unfortunately it lasted the whole week. Also there was not a whole lot of entertainment at night. There was a show one night but since there was no advertising for this we missed it. There is a sports/karaoke bar which was fine, a little small but with a few drinks it is enjoyable! Overall I thought it was a nice place. Beautifully lit up at night and a really nice pool and beach. The pictures on their website are accurate. There were way more positives than negatives, which worked especially well for us since we got it at a great discount.

I have worked in All Inclusive hotels in Mexico for the last 6 years, and i was annoyed upon arrival to the room and discovering that if i wanted more than the FOUR cokes or the TWO waters that were in the \"minibar\" there was an additional charge. then it just appeared that there were additional charges popping up everywhere!! After checking in we were hungry and the only option available for dinner was the buffet, in the same room with the noisy show, when i asked about the resetaurants i was told \"reservation only\" and minimum 1 day in advance, after speaking to the Capitan and explaining we were only there for one night, he let is in to the Italian restaurant, well, 30 mins passed until they took our order, then 25 minutes after taking the order the waiter came and told me that they did not have what i ordered! That night i have to be fair the room was clean, apart from the rusty doors, but overall the room was ok, the AC worked great and the bed was comfortable. Then at 8am we were woken up by a cleaner spending 10 minutes knocking on the door, \"To Check If The Room Was Occupied\"., followed by the noisy construction of the property next door (not the hotels fault i understand) We went for breakfast in Mirimar (buffet again - the only option) and were disgusted by the dirty, sloppy quality of the food, i ordered two \"quesadillas\" and was told i \"did not have the correct bracelet for food from the menu\" when i told the waiter that my bracelet was \"All Inclusive\" i was told \"yes but not for the menu\" (again extra charge!). After a waitress manager fighting with me, they brought me my \"quesadillas\" but they had not been cooked, and appeared to have come straight out of the fridge!!! Overall the service was terrible, the attitude of the staff was either kinda ok or rude, mostly rude. At the pool there is no waiter service, and by 12pm the bar had \"run out\" of Bacardi, Overall i was very dissappointed and wished i had chosen another hotel, i just felt happy we had not gone with my girlfriends family as originally planned, because it would of been very embarrasing.

I'm so glad we took the chance! If you're looking for an affordable but beautiful and clean resort with a great beach, Grand Coco Bay is definitely a wonderful deal for your money. Our airport shuttle driver told us that Grand Coco Bay is one of the oldest resorts in Playa del Carmen, but you would never know it. The resort is well-maintained and kept very clean. The pool is cleaned every morning. The beds are very firm, but I found them to be comfortable. The rooms were nicely appointed - I wouldn't call them luxurious, but they weren't lacking anything really important. (No alarm clock or coffee maker, but there is a blow dryer and mini fridge.) The resort staff was kind and friendly, but brush up on your basic Spanish words before you go, because their English isn't always that great. If you're an adventurous eater, the food in the buffet is good. Each night is a different theme night in the buffet restaurant, including International, Caribbean, French, Mexican, Gala, Chinese. I'm kind of picky and there were a few nights I wished we had made reservations for the resort's formal dining restaurants, which were both fantastic. (Try the churros! They're awesome!) The grill has lots of basic food for lunch, like burgers, hot dogs and French fries. Grand Coco Bay is a big family resort, which was a small drawback for us, since we met with some friends and were hoping for a fun adult vacation. There are a lot of kids, and they tend to not stay in the kid's pool area, which is mostly a baby pool. The construction on the condos next door was still underway when we were there (April 25-May 3) but we requested a room near the beach so we could neither see or hear the construction. It was really not bothersome at all. Even if you did get a room near the construction, it only goes on during the day, and all of the resort's balconies face inward towards the pool or beach, so you wouldn't have construction as the view from your room. We stayed in 2259 and it had a wonderful view. One complaint - if you're hungry late, there's no room service or eateries open.

I highly recommend it if you are on a budget but need a vacation. A little background - my boyfriend and I work on Wall Street and typically have high expectations in our travels. So I was pretty concerned having read the reviews of this being a 3-star hotel, but a friend had recommended it and so I trusted that he knew me well enough to know my expectations. We were nervous driving up, especially given that there is so much construction, but literally breathed a sigh of relief when we actually got to the hotel. Its a vacation resort. Check-in was easy and our room was really nice and cool when we got there. Our pool view was slightly blocked by a palm tree so in the morning we checked to see if we could get another one. The front desk guy literally gave us three different keys and let us select whatever room we wanted. The beach and pool are really nice, but the pool is quite exceptional. It is beautiful and fun, the pictures from the hotel are accurate so no need to question that. We especially loved the chairs in the pool and since it was so hot, stayed there most of the time. The beach is amazing, I can see how the boats could \"annoy\" some people, but honestly they are pretty far away. The massages were nice, pretty cheap compared to what I'm used to, and they are on the beach so you are listening to the waves, staying cool under a tent, but still outside. Amazing! Surprisingly, we thought the buffets were far and away better than the two restaurants. The service was ok, we love wine, so our wine refills didn't really come fast enough, but we may be an extreme in that case. We went to the buffet one night for dinner to just see it, and it was sooooo good. The breakfast is excellent as most people have said, and lunch buffet is good as well. We recommend going down to 5th Ave for dinner as well, as there are some cute places, and for the price we paid for GCB, we could afford to have a nice dinner elsewhere. Loved the pool bar, I loved swimming right up to it. We typically tipped between 5 - 20 bucks in the morning (not necessary) but the guy remembered us and knew our drink orders. We also drank a lot, so it was very beneficial for us to have the guy like us! We didn't see any of the shows at the hotel but went down to 5th Ave and saw the Fire Show at Blue Parrot - AMAZING! I highly recommend it. We also went to Chichen Itza through the hotel - it came with snacks, lunch, drinks (including beer) and was worth it. It's a long day and VERY HOT so be prepared to be exhausted. But its a wonder of the world so it's worth it. The rooms were clean, they were OK, this isn't the Ritz, but you honestly are NEVER in the room. There's no reason to take a nap inside if you can take one outside. The bathrooms were clean and the shower pressure was fine and it never ran out of water (hot or cold). Clean bathrooms are personally the most important thing to me, so it was fine and cleaned everyday. I think overall, the place is really nice for the price that we paid ($675 pp for flight from NYC, hotel, food, drinks, tax for six days five nights), and we had an amazing, romantic trip. We met people staying at the Riu's and Iberostar's, but those were pretty expensive during the time we travelled. I liked that this was a small hotel that was easy to access the bar, buffett, snack bar, and rooms without feeling like you had to make a hike to any of those places. We are now considering getting a condo down in Playa! Some Tips: 1. Ask for non-construction side rooms. 2. Bring a clock for the room (I always recommend this!). 3. Call ahead to make sure you have all-inclusive. 4. Don't go with a group of all girl friends or guy friends. Almost everyone is either coupled up or with family. There are no groups of friends so the chances of meeting people to hang out with is slim (unless you are a couple hanging out with another couple). 5. Tip 5-20 (depending on your own budget) to the bartenders once in the morning. Tip the lunch/dinner staff 2-5 dollars. They say tip is included but it really is miniscule for what they do for you. We tipped the maid 2 bucks although she probably deserved more. 6. 5th Ave - Jaguar has a good restaurant (the shrimp chipotle is SO good) and Blue Parrot for the fire show. Its also a pretty cool bar with swing chairs. 7.

We figured out after a few days to have breakfast at the buffet, lunch at the snack bar, and dinner at the nice restaurants. The coconut shrimp at the Mexican is great. The manager of the nice restaurants is a real jerk though. Elmanuel at the Italian is a great server. Very sweet. We ate at either the Mexican or Italian 5 nights of the vacation. The bartenders at the pool bar were great. Give them a $1 for the first few drinks and you'll be taken care of. The bananna colada was my favorite. the Maitai was pretty good too. Jsut make sure you drink plenty of water. Its so hot a humid the you sweat and loose lots of water. The night shows were pretty good. Really corny but that makes me laugh. The Michael Jackson show was great. I also really like the Tropical show. I wouldn't take kids to these shows. the humor was grown up at times. The message was just ok. Its not like it is in the States. Its was only $40. From what I could gather that the youger of the 2 ladies out there was better. I had the older one and she got alot of lotion in my hair.

Corona Beach has the best snorkeling. They also have 3 huge Pelicans that divebomb fish right in front of you. The was pretty entertaining in itself.

We arrived late in the evening on April 12th and stayed until April 18th. After a day spent in aiports, it was refreshing to be greeted with glasses of champagne and told that we would still be able to grab a bite if we'd like. Nearly all the employees were overly friendly, but we particularly commented on Ruth and Raul in the buffet. The rooms were clean. The beds were a little hard, but firmness of bed is an individual preference. I'm sure my boyfriend would have thought they were perfect had he been there. It would be nice to have a clock (particularly when trying to gauge the time until your dinner reservations), but you're on vacation and who needs a constant reminder of how much time is left until you're back at the grindstone? The cleaning staff was friendly and provide excellent directions if you ask. The beach is gorgeous. Despite being on vacation, I highly recommend getting up early enough to catch a sunrise or two. The beach is absolutely serene that time of day. Don't be caught off guard, as I was, if you see a group of three or four military members with guns. Evidentally they patrol the beach in the morning hours. The walk from the hotel to 5th Avenue is very reasonable, about 15 minutes. Sal in the hotels dive shop is very friendly, if you get a chance go out snorkeling or diving with him. The food was average in the buffett. There were things we loved and things we could have lived without. Of course their dessert bar was very good. Great selection of fruits. Breakfasts were something we looked forward to. We had reservations at both the Mexican and Italian resturaunts. We both preferred the Italian place. Be certain to get up early if you want to ensure you have reservations for a particular day as seating is very limited; I would estimate maybe 20 people per hour are served. The evening shows put on by the staff are entertaining. Not exactly what you'd find in Vegas, but still enjoyable to watch. The we were as far from the construction as you can be.

We were very lucky in that out the rear of our room we had a view of the beach and out the front we had a pool view. My friend and I had a great relaxing week at Grand Coco Bay.

It's an average to bellow average resort, I do have to say the rooms are plain but exceptionally clean, white sheets not so much the towels but oh well, they were clean. So, first 2 days in the resort our room was flooded from the AC, not a little bit of water but flooded, we went to front desk and was taken care of immediately, 2nd, our key card did not work 3 days in a row, very annoying to go to front desk after a long day ... but again, was taken care of immediately and no we did not have a cell phone with us to say that was the cause the key card was deactivated, 3rd, the lock in the bathroom did not work and one of us got stuck in the bathroom for what it seemed forever.. Food wise, I am a vegetarian so even I did ok, like people mentioned before, don't expect a 5 star restaurant but the food is decent, if nothing else they have a great variety of cheeses and vegetables and lots of fresh fruit. In general staff were nice but some ... I would have fired them on the spot for their rudeness, there was this one case that we asked the girl to serve us icecream in a plastic cup, which she was about to do and out of nowhere this guy from the pool bar walks over and tells her she can't do that, the cups are not for that porouse, no big deal, but his tone of voice I thought he was gonna slap us all... same guy, we were but the pool bar trying to get a cup of water and we asked for some ice, he said in a very mean tone that that water is not good for drinking, now if you've been to Coco Bay or if you will go you will see what I am talking about, that water is specially filtered for the guests to drink, or at least that's what we were told by the front desk first thing when we arrived. It does not matter anymore, we still had a great vacation, we were there to relax and enjoy ourselves, a group of 7 wonderful friends from different parts of US, nothing was going to stop us from having a good time.

This was our first trip to Mexico and our first trip with our daughters (7&5). First about Grand Coco Bay: The hotel & the grounds are great - nothing spectacular, but nothing at all to complain about. We stayed in 2123 - it was on the ground floor, non construction side, pool view. Our room met our expectations. It was clean & the housekeeping staff did a fair job. The entertainment staff are AMAZING. I thought the shows at night were great - I heard others complaining about them being cheesy - and some parts were, but I looked forward to going everynight & so did my family. During the day there were lots of activities that you could do or easily ignore. The staff is very attentive & made a HUGE effort to make us feel like family. There was water polo, dance lessons, step classes, water areobics, beach volleyball & soccer, spanish lessons etc. During the times where there weren't any activities the entertainment staff made a point of keeping the kids entertained with things like tic tac toe & just general playing around - my daughters loved them & I appreciated their effort. The bars weren't the highlight of the vacation. After a few days of horrible service with out so much as a smile - we gave the bartender at the swim up bar a generous tip & received mediocre service for the rest of the holiday. We found the restaurant, snack bar & bar staff lacked in their service skills - with the exception of the lobby bartender who always had a smile. The service improved with everyone with generous tips - but they made it very obvious with out a tip, you'd be waiting! The bars offered a small selection of premium liquor & the drinks were not watered down at all. We didn't eat at the a la carte's because none of us remembered closed toe shoes - and it is the rule (not sure how strictly it is enforced - we didn't bother trying) We ate breakfast and supper every day at the buffet. No complaints about the food at all. I found the selection to be average - there was always something - even for the pickiest of eaters. The snack bar served great nachos, pizza's, ice cream, sandwiches, french fries & burgers for those times you crave a little taste of 'home-style' food. We ate lunch there everyday & it was open from after breakfast until just before supper - which was great for the kids incase they didn't like the themed dinners. The pools are great - a small section for the little ones, lots of room for kids & another area that seemed to attract most of the singles & older couples. To get an umbrella we had to be out early - 7am for the pool, 6am for the beach - there aren't many & once people get them for the day, they don't move! The beach was beautiful, cool white sand, clear turquoise water that was as warm or even warmer than the pool. Walking to the beach from the resort you can head right to go into a busy section area & into town for shopping. Going to the left will take you on a very quiet walk and to very calm water. Grand Coco Bay is an intimate resort, I would not recommend it for young people looking for a party - you likely won't find it unless you bring all of the guests :) This is a great place for families with young to adolecent children, or 50 somethings looking for a quiet holiday. As for the area, with it being our first trip to Mexico a few things suprised me: 1) It is very safe - I had no problem walking on my own into town, taking a taxi or walking along the beach. 2) The area is very americanized - mcdonalds, dominos, starbucks, wal-mart, DQ. Wal-mart was great for the convienence of needed supplies - but if you are going just to see what Wal-Mart in mexico is like - don't - it is the same - but more expensive. 3) Very few people speak english. At Grand Coco Bay it was only the entertainment staff - the others really didn't know any English. It would have been very helpful to learn some basic spanish to communicate with taxi drivers & service staff. CANADIANS - we converted our money to american ( & paid .23) before leaving only to find out that Mexico is taking Canadian & American at the same value.

I knew about the boats beforehand and yes it seems like they are a bit close however I was very impressed with this hotel. The rooms are spacious and the beds and linens(pillows) are fine. Beds a bit hard but we did get used to them after a night. I only noticed the construction noise during 1 afternoon while trying to sleep. We took the room at the back of the hotel with the full view of the whole resort including ocean and found this quiet and very nice to enjoy the view. Food was fine - especially enjoyed the fresh grill every night -very fresh fruit and salads and we never had a problem with water. We are over 50 so we were not looking for late nights and strong drinks but found that you can ask for the premium brands and get them at the bars. The shows that really impressed us were the Mayan show and the dancing shows which are put on by professional dancers - very worth seeing - The Michael Jackson show is good as well and will appeal to some more than others. Staff are very friendly and we talked to a few tourists who were staying at more luxury hotels who complained about the size - too big. This hotel is small enough that you can actually recognize people and enjoy the friendships that you make plus no walking forever to get everywhere. This is very much a family resort - we saw many groups here as well who have returned for many years. The beach is lovely and very easy to get to town. We took a snorkelling tour to Porto Morales for half day and found it worth the money - 60.00 each. Otherwise we just enjoyed the resort and would return.

There was a lot of excitement as staff handed out champagne. This was tainted slightly when the Resort Manager, Alfonso, announced our rooms were not ready due to a \"water problem\". We were assured that our rooms would be ready the following day. The Grand Coco then sent us to the Blue Bay Grand Esmeralda making all the arrangements necessary for transport and temp lodging at the alternate resort. When we returned the following day is when our biggest concern arose. A friend and I took a kayak out. The snorkel gear, kayak, boggie board and other non motorized water sports our free. You simply sign your name and room number. The area where you rent these items is attached to the hotel. We would learn later the staff running this show is apparently contracted by the Grand Coco and not necessarily employees of the resort. While we were out on the kayak- our wives went over and asked to rent a kayak. Staff member Jorge says that he has no more kayaks right now, but asks if the girls would like to get a free massage. My wife and her friend (good looking women in late 20's) question where it is done. Jorge advises the massages are right upstairs of the little dive shop. He tells the women they have scented candles and a wonderful atmosphere. Jorge then leads them upstairs to a storage area. There is a few boogie boards on a banquet style table which Jorge quickly removes. He then grabs a towel from the floor and spreads it on the table. There is another guy up there as well. The girls are now certain this is no good. They turn and leave as quickly as possible. While walking back down the stairs Jorge is trying to get them to stay for the massage. My friend and I come back from kayaking and hear this story. We walk back over to Jorge and ask for a massage. He immediately points to the other side of the resort.... Where the big legitimate tent for massages is located. We ask if we can't get a massage here with him and Jorge says no. We then asked why he took our wives upstairs for a \"massage\"? Jorge and I proceeded to ague, talking in circles, for some time. He did admit to taking the women up there, but advised he was just showing where they sometimes did massages. Jorge was adamant that he was then going to call an actual masseuse, not give the massage himself. That was a lie. Best case scenario- these guys were going to try to massage/grope our wives. Worst case scenario- sexual assault. We of course notified the hotel manager. Alfonso acted like he was legitimately concerned. We had several conversations with him about this issue and he promised an investigation. We were never told the outcome of that investigation as promised. No apology. No job termination. Nothing. I realize we all have different tastes as travelers. From buffet choices to gratuities, I see a large variety of opinions on trip advisor. This is one everyone can agree with. What these guys tried to do was wrong. It is hard to believe this was the first time they tried to give a free \"massage\". Perhaps some other young woman was not as aware of the situation and fell for this scam. further, I realize there are sleaze bags all over the world. And no hotel can totally be held responsible for their employees actions. However, the Grand Coco Bay did not handle this with the appropriate seriousness. Lastly, the entertainment staff at this resort were fantastic. Our group had a blast with them from pool volleyball to the nightly shows. They worked hard and deserve praise.

This is our 6th trip to the Caribbean and our second to Mexico. We stayed at the Grand Palladium 5 years ago just after it opened and this time at the Grand Coco Bay from the 15th of February to the 22nd. Though both resorts are classed differently, I can very honestly say that the Grand Coco Bay met all my expectations and then some. We were 6 in our group and though it is not a consideration for most, inside and around the resort was almost completely handicapped friendly. My brother walks with a cane and has difficulty with stairs and this resort had elevators or ramps which would get you anywhere you might want to go. There were also 2 others in wheelchairs while we were there and they were able to move around very well. The food was excellent! We ate at the snack bar and at the buffet and the choice was wonderful. The two restaurants were awesome, but my favourite was the Mexican. Try the coconut shrimp! Let's face it...none of us eat as well at home and our choice is the one dish we prepare, so choice is awesome in the buffet, along with the fact that we don't have to prepare or clean up after ourselves! Choices over the week included paella, roast pork, roast beef, lots of different chicken dishes, fresh fish, sushi, lots of different potato choices and rice choices, spaghetti (prepared for you at the grill), lots of Mexican dishes, quesadillas, a great salad bar every night, fresh fruit (pineapple, papaya, honeydew melon, canteloupe, grapefruit, prunes) and the list goes on and on. Breakfast had the omelete/fried egg bar, plain scrampled eggs, scrambled eggs with ham one day, peas another day, vegetables - different each day. And with that were sausages one day, little franks another day, potatoes, at least 5 or 6 other dishes, a cereal bar with fresh coconut and fresh banana. There was a little table each morning for you to make yourself an orange juice with sparking white wine or a Bloody Mary if you were so inclined. Each morning featured orange juice, mango juice and papaya juice and usually another...watermelon juice or cantaloupe juice or other sort. We were on the side of the hotel away from the construction so it was quiet but my brother was on the other side. He found no difficulty with the noise at all and I must say, when asked at the desk with our Go Travel rep, they were ready to move him the following day if he wished. They were very, very accommodating. But he chose to stay where he was and that was fine! We never once heard any noise from the construction during the day! The service was absolutely excellent! Yes, we tipped...but in Montreal or anywhere else in Quebec, we tip for service. So if we stayed in a hotel for a week in Montreal and ate out at restaurants all the time, we would be tipping all the time...and the tips, let's face it, would be much higher. Service staff in Mexico or other parts of the Caribbean don't have the support systems in place as we do here and neither do they receive the government protected salary rates that their equivalents here in Quebec are entitled to. So a few pesos each time goes a long way to help them - and those few pesos could be for 4 drinks at the table each time. Yes, maybe it buys us better service, but more importantly, it helps them support, in some cases, their families. If we can afford a holiday down south, how can we be so cheap to refuse to leave a tip in another country or complain about it. We do it automatically here. As I mentioned, the service was wonderul everywhere we were on the resort. A smile and a regular 'hola' is worth it. Bad attitude breeds bad attitude and I believe good attitude breeds good attitude. My daughter loved the fruit juices and my husband asked if there would be a certain type of juice the following day for breakfast as it was our last day and her favourite. Not only did they do that particular juice the following day and the manager showed it to us, but at noon the day before when we asked, the manager came over with 2 glasses made just for her then. And we had not tipped that meal as we were just eating. Oh, and one more thing about tipping. We asked the manager at the buffet if the other staff received any of the tips, i.e., kitchen staff, the sweepers, the greeter, etc. He told us that the tips are all pooled together so the meagre tips are actually spread over many people. So if you are going there, please remember if and when you tip, that it is going thinly! We did have a problem with our air conditioner the first day and it was fixed within 15 minutes. And the service man arrived with a security guard with him which made me feel very secure that our things would be protected. Our safe worked extremely well and, after reading a few reviews which said that they had things taken from them, I was nervous as well. But we were very careful to lock it immediately after using it and checking that it was indeed locked after. Perhaps previous complainers did not check it after locking it and the code had not worked. I waited too long after entering it to press \"lock\" once and it did not lock...so do it right and check - it's also your responsibility to protect yourself. Well, I guess I could go on and on but it may get too long to read. We loved it there, the size, the service, the wonderful weather and beach...with the winter we've all had this year, it was a joy! I highly recomment the resort and would welcome any questions if you are planning a trip there!

I heard a few negative things from other guests on Trip Advisor so I was a little worried when we got there. I have to say the food was great, the drinks were great. The service was exceptional and the place looked beautiful. It's a great location and close to a lot of places so you can head to town for 3.50$USD by taxi. We had a leak in our air conditioner on the first day and within ten minutes of calling the lobby, a repairman and a security guard were there taking care of it. There was a lot of construction but we didn't hear any of it till we were standing out waiting for the bus to take us to Cancun to the airport. Our room was facing the pool bar and grill and as soon as our doors were shut, we couldn't hear a thing. Don't leave your doors open though, as our friends did and had an uninvited guest - a giant cockroach. Again, the maid came right up and got rid of it and they never had a problem after that. The place is kept very clean, there are always staff mopping, cleaning and picking up after you. I think what highlights the quality of the service best for me was my Dad asking the manager in the buffet if they would have watermelon juice the following morning as we were leaving the next day. It was at the buffet once and it was delicious. The manager said he couldn't promise but he would speak to the chef. A friend of ours pointed me out as the one asking for the juice and he said, 'Tomorrow!' I went to the bathroom, came back and there were two glasses of cantaloupe juice (what he thought I was asking for and was great) for me. The following morning, one of the juices was cantaloupe juice. It is honestly a great place to visit, quiet enough that you don't have to be up at 7:00am to save a chaise by the pool but with enough to do that even if the weather wasn't great, you'd still have plenty to do. And to anyone going there through GoTravelDirect.com, Lisa is wonderful! She was able to refund my money when I couldn't go parasailing after slipping on the rocks at a cenote.

The \"all inclusive\" trip was purchased through Orbitz, but during check-in, the front desk informed us that we did not purchase the \"all inclusive\" package. The front desk associates spoke very little English and there was no manager on site for two days to help us with this issue. We used the internet to do a \"mock\" purchase-to prove this price included the \"all inclusive\" package. Four hours on the phone with Orbitz and a very expensive international phone bill, we gave up and paid the additional $900. The reservation restaurants had good food and the service was outstanding! You make the reservations in the buffet area in the morning. The night we went to the Mexican restaurant it was raining very hard out. The ladies bathroom was flooded with an inch of water. That night we witnessed many roof leaks around the resort. Most of the staff was armed with buckets and mops for the night. The buffet food was below average compared to other resorts I have stayed at before in Mexico. Many items had no identifications in the buffet line. The breakfast buffet had no bacon or sausage, and ran out of butter most days. The beach area was very nice. Walking along the beach to get to town was an easy walk. I would not recommend walking the streets to town because of the loose dogs wandering the streets. Be very careful if you go on the Quad-runners...the dogs will chase you down. The towel check out area near the pool was usually staffed with guest's \"children\" staying at the hotel. As I am sure they were not part of the hotel staff. It seemed more like a day care area for children abandon by their parents for the day. Except for day five of our vacation...when a guest had a heart-attack in front of the towel check out, and died. The staff was very unprepared for an emergency. They had no idea how to handle the situation and a \"guest \" had to take control. We went to town to escape the terrible experience we had just witnessed. Three hours later we came back to the same scene, a dead man covered with pool towels, hidden behind a Carlos and Charles sign. Overall, this hotel was just OK.. I would not recommend staying at this resort. I also would be very careful when using \"Orbitz\" to make your travel arrangements. We had prepaid our ground transportation to and from the airport through Orbitz, representing Gray's Van Line. On the way back to the airport we experience a road block from another taxi company. We were told to get out of our \"Gray's\" taxi as it was not licensed for the driving in the Playa Del Carmen area. We had to pay $40 to the new taxi driver, as our Gray Line taxi driver drove off.

After reading several reviews on this hotel, I was nervous about what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised with how much we enjoyed our stay. There is construction going on right next door. It is a big project, a new resort being built with lots of machines and workers working from early morning until sunset. We didn't hear any noise from the construction while we were at the pool, at the beach or in our room. We had a room that was on the non-construction side. The rooms are simple and functional, have a/c and a fan, a safe ($3/day). We found the water pressure in the bath/shower lacking at times, but whatever. The food was above average. There was always something for everyone, even with the pickiest of eaters. The 2 a-la-carte restaurants were great. We thought that the mexican one was a little nicer, but both had great food and a nice atmosphere. The beach is amazing. There are boats anchored just past the swimming boundaries, but it was never a big deal. I found out that they are parked there because there is a large reef just off the coast of the Grand Coco Bay, and the boats use this as protection. If you do go swimming or snorkelling past the roped-off area, be very careful as there are many boats or waverunners that don't watch for swimmers. It is about a 15min walk along the beach and 2 blocks up and you are in the heart of playa del carmen on 5th ave. I loved how close we were to everything, unlike other hotels that we stayed at that were closer to Tulum. We were able to go to Walmart for diapers if needed, or stroll into 5th ave to pickup some souveniers. Here are some tips that I can think of that may be useful: - book the $25 snorkelling trip from the drive shack at the hotel. It's an hour trip, and the reef is amazing - bring a insulated mug. everyone had these down there, the plastic cups that are handed out at the bars are tiny. - if you have a baby or are in a wheelchair, rooms 2401-2410 are only accessible by stairs, which was difficult for us at times with a baby stroller. - the entertainment staff at this resort are great, the are very friendly and approachable. try some activities to make the most out of your stay Overall this is a great resort for families. There is lots to do if you want, or just relax and do nothing - it's up to you. We would go back again.

This was our first trip to Mexico and we didn't want to stay in Cancun(too crowded). My husband planned the trip as a suprise for me. I told him that he picked the perfect place. I liked this resort for many reasons mostly because it was in the middle of everything! Cancun(hour north), Tulum(1hr south) 5th ave(5min taxi ride or 10min walk), Maroma-snorkeling adventure(20min north) and the ferry to Cozmul(45mins) etc.. The resort was very clean and had a purfication system so it was ok to drink the water. Make sure you bring insulated mugs to keep your drinks from melting too fast! The resort was painted in bold colors and had a festive energetic staff. The staff would come out to the beach/pool each day and try to get everyone to play volleyball, water aerobia, Streaching etc...(haha) I actully played volleyball with them and had a blast. There were people of all ages and nationalities at the resort. BEST BEACH IN PLAYA The pool and beach were never EVER crowded. There were boats docked in the ocean near the resort which created another beautiful backround. Some people complained (in their review)about the boats being there but we both though it was just a picture of paradise. We walked the beach every morning and we definitely had the best beach in Playa. This was the main reason my husband chose the resort, because of the beach. To the right of the hotel beach, there were no hotels, no boats &, just a few people. It was a beautiful long stretch of beach. To the left of the hotel beach, there were colorful shacks, hotels & more people on the beach. This is the way to 5th avenue and the ferry. We felt very safe both at the resort and walking along the beach. Our room was basic with an awsome view (off the balcony) of the pool & ocean. We WERE on the construciton side, however, it didn't really bother us much. It seemed they worked 7 to 7 each day which didn't effect us much since we weren't really in our room that much. We had an electronic safe which was pretty cool. The Hotel lobby was beautiful, and buzzing with people every night talking, drinking, playing cards and reading. The shows were good especially (Pre-Mexico) show. The hotel had two reservation only restaurants: Latin or Italian. We chose the Italian Restaurant on Tuesday night and it was delicious. It was a very small & intimate restaurant (maybe 10 guests max). The Buffet restaurant was beautiful with a view of the beach. The windows were always open allowing the breeze to flow through. The staff were very friendly refilling coffee and water as needed. The Breakfast and Lunch buffet's were delicious. I especially liked the french toast and chocolate milk. The Dinner buffets were different themes each night. In comparison to other all inclusive buffets I have to rate this one a 7.5 out of 10 for variety. Monday night was Mexican night and the food was spicy for me (the corn, rice & beef were too spicy). I ended up eating a lot of bread & salad that night. Every other meal was delicious so I have to say they just need more variety at the buffet and for dessert. There was a snack bar that offered ice cream, tacos, burgers, sandwiches, fries & pizza. We used the taxi service through the hotel a couple times and never felt unsafe. We booked our snorkel excursion through the hotel. We chose the half day snorkle/sail in Maroma, known as the second largest reef in the world(by travel channel). Hopefully you will go out on the boat with Joel, the leader. We will never forget that excursion, he was so much fun. My husband and I have been to other all inclusives in both Aruba and Punta Cana and this is definitely right up there. In fact it sort of looked alot like the resort in Aruba. We had a fabulous vacation and look forward to returning to the Grand Coco Bay in the future!

It was supposed to be only 8 days and turned into 9 due to weather etc. ahh snow!! There was 10 of us all together, but I'll share mine and my husbands thoughts with you...we have travelled a few times, having been to the Dominican on several occassions( including for our wedding), and Venezuela, so hopefully our info is helpful. We found that the hotel was exactly what we booked. And good value for the $$ paid. The food was very good, best snack bar we've had at a resort yet in terms of variety, everything from Mexican (quesadillas, tostadas, to chicken wings, fresh sandwiches, burgs, dogs and fries). In fact, most of us skipped the lunch buffet and just snacked We didn't find any problem with the service at the restaurants (buffet or otherwise) except that sometimes they were a bit slow to replenish food, but we just avoided going in with the dinner rush, and didn't have a problem. Since the snack bar was open from 10:30 to 5:30, we were snacking all day anyhow. We didn't tip at the buffet, but we did at the a la carte, since, although it is all inclusive, you are still getting personalized service. You don't need to tip alot, but it's a nice gesture, and appreciated I'm sure. There were always pool chairs available through out the day, even at the beach. Maybe the week were were there was quiet, not sure, but none the less, it was good. Bar staff was always friendly and found ways to liven things up. We tipped our pool bartender at the beginning of the week, and had excellent service all the time. The pool staff did a good job of getting people involved in a variety of things, from Water Aerobics, Bingo, water polo...they'd even play ping pong with you if you didn't have a partner. Entertainment at night was pretty good, although the shows were sometimes a little shorter than we would have liked since they were so good, but after a long day it didn't really matter. If you can catch the Michael Jackson show, do! This is a good area if you like a change of scenery once in a while, as the shopping is a short walk either along the beach or the road. The hotel shop however has pretty much what you need, and surprisingly, the prices were pretty fair. Oh and there was no timeshare, or selling of anykind, all the way up the beach, so you can relax while you're out and about. The thing we liked best about this hotel was the size. It is big enough that you're not on top of people, but small enough that you can take a thirty second walk to the beach if you get tired of the pool..oh, and as for the construction, we spent most of the week on the non-construction side, but when our trip home was delayed, we got a new room on the construction side, and honestly, it wasn't a big deal. Most people want to be out in the sunshine pretty early, afterall that's why you're there right. Everyone in our group thought the rooms were nice, and clean, the maidservice does a good job, although they might pass through your room in the morning one day, and afternoon the next..but they always knocked on our door in the morning to see if we needed our rooms done up. We only did one tour, the Captain Hook Pirate dinner, it was nice since it got us out for an evening...after dinner, the two boats \"attack\" each other and put on quite a show..dinner and drinks are included...it is alot of fun, and good value.

Of course, we were apprenhensive given some of the other reviews but we were satisfied and thought the service was terrific, the food just fine, (except for one night at the buffet) and the view and location incredible. SERVICE The staff were accomodating and polite, we certainly don't receive this type of service in most North American hotels we stay at. I did notice on a few occasions that I did not recieve service at the swim up bar but on those occasions the swim up bar was monopolized by groups that had travelled together and who were rather loud and drunk, they were getting service. Probably because you couldn't miss them. I felt sorry for the bartenders. On many occasions, over 4 different days certain individuals that were really drunk would be screaming, yelling the bartenders name over and over again, as if they were best friends and they were being overall obnoxious. Not all intoxicated people not acted like that. It would be hard to be patient in the face of this type of customer treatment but I never once saw a bartender react negatively to this terrible treatment. The bartenders are making drinks non stop all day long and most of the time without tips because you don't carry money in your bathing suit and you certainly wouldn't leave it at the beach while swimming etc. Even if you tip the first few times you aren't going to tip every single time you get a pop, water, etc. If you really watch the staff I bet they are frustrated by their treatment of a few rude guests several times a day. In the face of this adversity I'd say the staff are really good. ROOMS We did change our room twice due to the excessive noise on the construction side. It didn't bother me so much but it bothered my husband particularly since it rained our first day and we were confined to our room sporadically. No big deal the front desk staff were accomodating and understanding on each occasion. We didn't blame them as it is not the fault of the front desk staff. On the third room we recieved an ocean front view , we paid extra for this as we should have and had no problems. The rooms are clean, properly stocked, cleaned promptly. In so far as the mini fridge is concerned BIG DEAL, you get four pops, if you want something else go to the bar or restaurant. We have stayed at many resorts and they usually do not supply water. FOOD The food was good The breakfests consisted of cereal, at least five types, various breads for toast, yogurt, fresh fruit, an omelet bar, potato's, french toast and pancakes etc. Plenty of fresh fruit, so terrific Another good feature is the patio tables and umbrellas' located near the snack bar by the pool and swim up bar. IT gives you some shade while eating and allows you to stay by the pool. A nice break from the sun. Lunch at the snack bar was pizza, ribs, chicken wings, roast chicken, hotdogs, burgers and nachos. We didn't try the hotdogs but everything else was good. Again, a better variety then most poolside snack bars we've had and the food was good. Lunch at the buffet consisted of salad items, plenty of dressings, always balsamic and olive oil to put on them, fresh fruit, fish, meat dishes, potato's desserts, cheese coldcuts. Dinner The mexican buffet was fabulous as was the Italian. The other nights consisted of hot meat dishes, several fish dishes, pasta, a roast of some kind, a salad buffet and custard type desserts, or cheese cake, which was very good. The Italian restaurant was very good. There was always plenty of drinks served throughout the meals. The service again excellent. I am not sre what else can be expected. It was terrific. BEACH the beach was beautiful, white sand, easy walking into and out of the ocean. No rocks etc to impede walking or swimming in the water. The boats are not a problem and they do not ruin the view. Who swims out that far anyway? The water activities are fun and again the staff are very patient. We observed more then one individual raising their voices at water staff because they wanted to use the catamaran. When the staff questions guests to ensure that they know what to do, they are doing so because they need to keep guests safe. Most of us do not live on the ocean and not everyone knows how to sail. It astounds us that guests take exception to this type of support from staff. So if the staff seem to be reluctant about letting you go with a catamaran, remember you are ultimately thier responsibility and your life is in their hands in terms of allowing an inexperienced person go out. The cabana's are plentiful although gone fairly early in the morning, but this is not unusual as this occurs at every resort. Activities There are many, many activiites, they invite everyone to participate and are not too forceful, attention is given equally to everyone, not just young women, the staff converse with all but are not pushy. There was great participation with all activities. Always a great turn out for volleyball, water aerobics, spanish lessons, bocci ball. Playa del CArmen/shopping Some will mention in their reviews that certians areas in playa del carmen are not nice and look scary. They are right, but this is the outskirts of the shopping district and quite frankly what I come to expect whenever I travel anywhere in some of these countries. The shopping is great, Playa del CArmen tourist district is quite charming, trendy with lots of great bars, restaurants, shops of all kinds. It is great for people watching. The taxis' are 35 peso's each and what a deal compared to home. OVERALL I would go back again but only if I could insist on staying on the non construction side. We were satisfied with everything and consider it a true four star. We have travelled to a number of locations, jamaica, hawaii, california, florida 10 times, dominican republic three times, mexico 5 times, all over europe, north america, most ski destinations etc. So we feel that we are making an informed opinion. To expect more of the food, ie. meat and hot dish selection would mean that you should be staying at a five star. IF you think the decor needs updating that may be true but since it is clean, we forgave that. IF it seems too small then you may have selected the wrong location because there are many huge resorts in the area. IF you find playa del carmen surrounding area too poor and scary then you may wish to rethink going to many carribean locations, this is not always uncommon. Safety: use a safe always, do not carry large sums of cash, use travellers cheques and maybe leave your cell at home if you are concerned about having it ripped off, we did. Stealing is not uncommon in most tourist destinations, airports etc around the world. (not just playa del carmen) Staff were always polite and approachable. OVerall I am always surprised at some of the things that annoy other travellers I say this wondering what on earth some people eat for lunch, breakfest or dinner that is sooo much better, if it is better quality food, less fattening etc, then a five or six star is for you.

In fact, we're in withdrawal, missing the excellent service, the HOT 33 degrees, the most beautiful white sand beach and best holiday ever. This was our FOURTH TIME at the same hotel and already planning for next year. It's the best location as it's only 10 to 15 min walk to 5th Avenue shopping, no need for a taxi. Absolutely no issues ever regarding any or no maintenance. All staff were more than friendly and helpful. I trust the Jewellery Store items as they are guaranteed real not fake (the ones that turn black when you get back home). The young entertainment staff were wonderful and fun always. Never ever did we feel unsafe and never locked our stuff in a safe. I'm just blown away every time I read the very false, negative comments read on this website. Those people must not be happy anywhere, including their own homes. Remember you're on vacation in paradise and little things need not bother you. So to those of you just on your way to the Grand Coco Bay.....please ignore those awful reviews and I promise you will always return to this resort from now on. Feel free to email me with any questions and I will be very happy to answer if I can. I literally cried when I left and my bags are not unpacked yet!

The snack bar had good food but it took for ever to get served as they would put one hamburger on at a time and watch it cook before they would wait on anyone else. Water pressure was awful and we could not get washclothes. One day when we went in from the pool at around 5:00 our room had not been cleaned yet and it took over an hour to get someone to just bring us towels so we could shower and meet our group to go out. On our second day I had my cell phone stolen as did one other person in our group. They only seem to take the ones that work in Mexico. I thought the management would want to know so they could put a stop to it, but they basically called me a liar and said I did not even bring a cell phone. I was not asking them for anything so why would I lie. When I got home I had a $258.00 bill for the 5 days that they had it.

To my surprise they had a room waiting (room 2440). Before going up to the room, the bellboy took us on a short tour. The staff was very friendly and seemed to want to be sure we enjoyed our stay. Housekeeping did an excellent job. In general the resort is kept very clean. Food and drinks were good. There are 2 computers to use for $3.00 per half hour or $5.00 per hour. The beach going north from the resort is excellent for walking a long distance. Now the negatives: There is MAJOR construction going next to the Coco Bay. And I mean MAJOR. Core drilling rigs, pile drivers, jack hammering, etc. We were offered another room but it didn\u2019t have a view. We are early risers and out of the room by 6:30 a.m. so the noise didn\u2019t bother us. The crews start working at 7:00 a.m. and work until dark. I found it to be another form of entertainment. I spent a lot time on the walkway just watching. You never hear the construction noise around the pool or at the beach. There are 3 bars. When we went to town one day (walked in on the beach) we got caught a downpour. Took a cab back to the resort ($3.50) and the only bar open was the pool bar and we had a drink standing in the rain. I think the pool bar staff should have been moved to lobby bar. The room safe is $3.00 a day. The resort stocks the mini bar with 4 cans of pop every other day. NO water! Everyone buys a liter of water ($1.50) at the gift shop and refills the bottle at the pool bar or restaurant. The lounge chairs are showing signs of their use. There were many families the week we were there. I realize that kids will be kids, but the parents let them run wild in the dining room and around the pool. This resort has about 120 yards of beach front and at any given time there are about 30 boats anchored just out side the swimming area. There are no boats anchored anywhere else in the area. Go figure. No one could tell us why the boats are anchored there. They really detract from what could be a great ocean view. Still we had an enjoyable week in the sun.

Plenty of activities around the pool for those who are interested. Very kid-friendly. It definately seemed like a family/couple type of resort, as we didn't meet many other singles.

I met a few people who have been before that brought their own insulated cups that the bartendenders didn't mind filling for them. The servers don't come by often while on the beach, so expect to get your own drinks much of the time.......luckily it's a short walk.

As usual the flight with Zoom airlines was good including the meals. We were met at the Cancun airport by Aaron who we had met last year in the Dominican Republic and he advised that we would be staying at the Gran Coco Bay . The rep there is Lisa and she was great. We were swiftly on our way and once we reached the hotel check-in was fast although we had to wait an hour for our room it was well worth the wait. We were in a room that seemed to have recently been renovated and although not huge was perfect for a weeks stay. The room was extremely clean, TV worked well as did the mini-fridge, water was hot although at times the water pressure was a little low. We were lucky enough to have a room that was near the solarium a little known place that got that extra hour of sun at this time of year. The food was good and the a la cartes (Mexican and Italian) were excellent we ate at both twice. We found the service in the buffet to be a little slow and sometimes non existent especially at dinner so the al al cartes worked out better. This is the first resort we have been too where you could book the a la carte when you went for breakfast which made a lot more sense than having to give up beach time to stand in line to make a reservation. The beach was excellent and you could walk a long way in either direction. It was probably the best beach in that part of Playa Del Carmen. A lot of other hotels had sandbags to hold the sand. There is also a lot of construction of new hotels/condos in the area. We went on a tour of Tulum booked through Lisa and it was a very reasonably $38 for the 6 hour excursion with a guide. The full day trip which included Tulum and Xel-Ha was $139. If you are fortunate enough to be at the hotel when they have their Mayan show...every second monday at 8 pm, its well worth seeing and make sure you have your camera. I didn't and didn't want to miss any of the hour long show to go get it..so if you have any pictures, please post some on this website or maybe you could send me a few.

This trip we asked our travel agent for somewhere with less people then our usual places. We read all the reviews regarding the Coco Bay and have to admit we were a bit worried but have always been open to try new adventures. We arrived Nov 9th. Check in was comical. We were assigned room 2250. We tried our card key 4 times in every direction possible. After the 4th attempt someone inside the room opened the door. We returned to the front desk & the girl changed the zero to a six and sent us off to room 2256. Again, we tried the card key every direction to no avail. And again the door was opened from the inside by construction people covered in plaster tearing out the floor. We returned to the front desk for the 3rd time & asked for a room minus people and not under construction. We were treated like pests but too bad, we paid for a private room minus plaster dust everywhere & we weren't giving up until we got it. We were sent to room 2126. Finally, looked okay, no people & had a clean floor & walls. All was good until that evening. Every sound from the lobby bar echoed down the open air wall into our room. Then 6:00 am the cleaning people cart brigade began right outside our door. The ramp was literally outside our door so we were awakened by the \"clunk-clunk\" sound of their cart wheels up the cement ramp to the tile outside our door. I'd guess 12-15 of them. You guessed it... I was at the front desk at 8:00 demanding our 4th room in less than 24 hours. In my requests what I demanded in a room I failed to mention a room we could get more than 4 hours of sleep in. So we added sleep, no people or a private room, with a floor & walls. They sent us to the 4th room to check out before we accepted it. It was on the 4th floor, side of the building minus construction going on, all looked good. We did fail to check the shower though, our mistake. We packed out bags from room 2126 & moved to the 4th floor, unpacked & our vacation finally began about 13:00 the day after we arrived. Other then the check-in fiasco, having to wash my hair under the tub spicket due to negative water pressure (oh, & forget any hot water) we have no complaints. The food is far from anything special, the service was okay (sparse, they really stretch what employees they have to the limit) excluding the arrogance of the front desk people with their attitude that we are gringo Americans (oh yes, after our 4th attempt the 2 at the front desk called us gringos as we walked away but not worth the argument so we let it go).

The rooms are a little dated and nothing extraordinary but they are clean and they have everything you could want. Anyways who goes on vacation to stay in the room? it is true that the maid will knock at 8 am or earlier but they give you a card to slip in your slot to say do not disturb if you use it then no problem. Warnings: The guy upfront is not the concierge he is a timeshare salesman. Just be friendly and tell him no and he leaves you alone. Also do not use the long distance from the telephone it is a scam and they will fraudulently use your credit card. I don't think it is related to the hotel but get a phone card in America before you leave if you need to call home. About the beach out front: It does have boats out front but if you walk like 100 ft up or down the beach you have the best beach in all of Playa. I know we walked and rode a boat all down it. Basically if you are looking for something over priced and fancy looking with marble and robes and big beds this isn't the place for you.

Upon arriving to the hotel, I was a bit leary because of the location (They are building new high end apartments right next door...so there is a bit of construction) BUT was quickly reassured when the bellboy came to help us with our bags. There was NO line, and we were given glasses of champagne while we checked in. The staff was very helpful! Keep in mind that if you plan on using the safe (which we did) you have to pay the $3 a day up front : ) Anyway, we booked our trip through Expedia... and am glad that we did! We had a Expedia rep at the hotel who helped us with booking excursions and such (which I ALSO recommend)... and he even warned us about the \"Timeshare scam\" and told us that if we had ANY problems with anything....(hotel staff, etc..) to let him know! We ended up booking 3 excursions... snorkeling, parasailing, and swimming with dolphins... those were all fun...but I wish we had had more beach time instead, but hey... you live and learn, right? We did get rained on a couple days... but I had done research online about the weather and sorta expected it. The area is known for unpredictable, sometimes rainy weather...so keep that in mind! : ) The beach IS BEAUTIFUL, the water is very blue/teal and has WHITE sand! Yes, the boats are parked right outside the swimming area, but we knew that beforehand and quite frankly it didnt bother us! The food isn't FABULOUS by any means, but just stick with what you know (like I did) and you probably won't have any problems. Breakfast was the best meal in my opinion because they had scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausage, etc.... and even a build your own omelette station! I would recommend making reservations for the other restaurants at least once-if not more. I had no difficulty in making that reservation, and I'm NOT an early riser! All you have to do is go to the buffet area sometime from 7-11am (I think those are the times) and put your name down with the person at the podium.... there wasnt a line at all. I would also tell you to look for the photographer (his name is Sergio) that comes to the resort... he brings different animals to take pictures with.. the pics are cute, and you can either have em printed..or buy the cd to print them when you get home... Make a deal with him though... he's super nice and will make a deal if you want your pictures... he also took pics of just me and my boyfriend on the beach...and they were very pretty! Oh, and also...if you want to snorkel at the hotel, you can check them out for an hour (longer if you want) at the little shack thing off of the beach! The weekends DID bring in the locals, and sometimes (At the snack bar) it was hard to get service because of all the children \"cutting\" in line...BUT, All in all, I liked the resort...no it wasnt \"Fancy\" but we just wanted a relaxing time on a beautiful beach...and thats what we got! The resort isn't too fast paced, or even too big, There wasnt too much bad to say about Grand Coco Bay!

Not sure why they wouldn't have been left with the towels but it took until the middle of the next day to get washcloths. Same with the min-bar.

The view from the beach is littered with all of the local boats parked in front of the hotel's beach area. The linens on the bed were very old. The elevator on our end of the bdlg was broken during our entire stay. Since you couldn't go through the lobby wet, we had to go up/down 3 flights of stairs to get to the pool area each time. The hotel is located in the middle of a construction zone with mud/water/construction workers everywhere. The hotel workers told us we could walk to 5th Avenue - luckily we took a cab because the area was very questionable and we had a child with us. Also - if you are on vacation - be aware that maid service comes at 8:00 in the morning (every morning that we were there) and we were at the opposite end of the hallway from where they started so I guess they started cleaning well before 8am.

We had a wonderful time, and we will definitely go back next year. The resort is beautiful and very safe. Once we went to 5th Ave. and onother time we went to Super Walmart. Each were only about a 5 min ride. Both times we took a cab, 3 to be exact, because we did everything as a group, in the evening after dinner, and each time the concierge wrote down the cab number we left with and cab number we came back with. They keep a track of where their guests go. Each cab ride is $3. We come from the midwest and were shocked at how high the prices at Walmart were. We needed to buy tanning lotions, and Walmart prices were lower than the prices at the resort store or the stores at 5th Avenue. But still, they were not a steal. We also noticed that many of their items, were more expensive than at our store here in our hometown. Go figure. The rooms are comfortable with specious balconies, great pool and beach with planty of comfortable chairs. Many times we started the day at the pool, than walked over to the beach, hours later came back to the pool, and our stuff was still where we left it, no one took it. Some of us took very early morning walks on the beach, walking to the 5th Ave., about 20 min. each way, and nothing ever happened to us. There were many early walkers on the beach. The food was very good. None of us were picky. We didn't expect lobsters and filets for every meal. After all, what do we all eat at home. We ate our meals mostly at the buffet restaurant. Tons of choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We ate couple of lunches at the snack bar, on the patio. Great waffle fries, the kids loved them. Except for ice cream, the snack bar had nothing else for dessert, nor any fruit, so what we did was walk over to the buffet restaurant, ask for a carry out plate and filled it with whatever we wanted, than rejoined our group at the snack bar. We ate once at the italian restaurant, and once at the mexican restaurant. Both were fine, nothing special. Again, we're not that picky. But we preffered the casual attire at the buffet restaurant. The staff was awesome. Hard workers. They really tried their best to please you with whatever you wanted or needed. We tipped with each meal. We LOVED the entertainment staff. We got to know many of them very well. Our favorite was Ricky, what a great smile, and the kids loved Nathalia. They all worked hard from early morning till early morning. No kidding. Every nite at 8 pm was the mini disco, and our kids loved it. The entertainment staff was great with the kids. After the mini disco, was the actual show. We loved their comedy shows, especially the scene based on the movie the bodyguard. The Michael Jackson show was great too. Every night was a different show. The casino night was hilarious. Everyone played with fake money, and almost everyone won something. The shows ended at 10 pm, and afterwards they were offering ascort to the local night clubs. That's why I say they worked hard from early morning to early morning. They deserve to be tipped. We had a very enoyable time, and we will go back again, but probably not during the hurricane season. Too scarry, especially being with small children. By the way, the resort is very family oriented. We saw many children from 2 to teenages. Our own children fit right in. Great childrens pool. There were also many europeans. We got to know a few. Apparently every time they come, they stay a month. Imagine that.

It was very inexpensive, $386.00 per person, this including air fare, hotel, food and drinks. The rooms are very small and very unkept. No ironing board, alarm clock or any good TV channels. The air conditioner did not cool the room, there was barely enough water pressure to take a shower, your fridge is only stocked with 4 soft drinks that have to last you for 2 days, as they only replace the drinks every other day. You can't drink the water and yet they won't supply you with water. Be sure and take you own bottle water, as they charge an outrageous price. Most resorts have a safe in your room, as does this resort, but they charge you $3 a day to use it. ( ridiculous! ) There are only two restaurants to choose from if you don't want to eat at the buffet every night. The food is not good at all. The service sucked all around. The beach stunk and like others have said, there are all kinds of boats anchored there just off of the beach. The drinks are small and weak and the employees act put out when you ask for a drink.

The day before the Hurricaine hit, we were evacuated to another hotel that was located a little more inland. It did not have the ammenities that we had grown accustomed to but we were safe, well fed and again, well taken care of. At 1am when I couldn't sleep I stepped outside our room to the balcony to find members of the entertainment staff checking on the guests, making sure everyone was ok.

Some things to keep in mind . . . .if you are asked to visit a new hotel, \"The Royal Real\" , for a time share presentation don't go. The place is beautiful but the staff is snobbish and the folks that give the presentation are pushy as all hell and will severley waste your time. Also, should you decide to do an excursion or need transportation from the airport in Cancun to the hotel, you must know that the city services are AMAZING and you can get around for next to nothing. The ADO bus will cost you $8 per person from the Cancun airport to 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen. This bus leaves every hour. In Playa, the bus station is located directly adjacent to the cab stand. A taxi to Grand Coco Bay is $3.50. You do not have to spend $50.00 per person roundtrip to get to your hotel. We went to Xel Ha, bought our tickets at the hotel, paid $59 per person for our entrance and all you can eat and drink (The Only Way to Go Honestly!) . But instead of relying on the hotel's transportation to take us and pick us up which would have costed an additional $30 per person, no [--], we took the local van which cost us $2 per person each way and we were able to come and go whenever we pleased. The local transportation found at 2nd street just off of 5th Avenue is your freedom to the excurions. They go everywhere, Xel-Ha, Tulum, Xcaret . . . there are even local ferry's to Cozumul! PLEASE, think twice before you pay too much for your transportation.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cGood Deal for a quick Vacation\u201d", "Author": "mrshouston", "ReviewID": "UR8509840", "Content": "My husband and I went right before Dean came into town........we actually flew back the Wednesday before it happened so we were not affected by that at all.

The food is OK we stayed at Aventura beforehand so there really is not a comparison since I feel the hotels are on two separate levels. We ate at the Italian and the Mexican restaurants (both you have to reserve) and the Mexican was by far our favorite. There were tons of chairs on the beach available and the water was awesome. My husband snorkeled out a bit and found some fish so he enjoyed that. The only negatives were one day my husband went down a little earlier than the 7 book time for the restaurants (he was 10 mins early) and they wouldn't let him go ahead and book it. Also, don't get caught up in the time share business...........we had read the reviews so we were forewarned and just stayed away! Oh and the beds are a little hard but my husband liked it so it's all in preference I think. Overall we enjoyed our trip and had a good time.

When we arrived we were greeted with champagne and a cool towel to fresen up. The man who helped us at the front desk was very welcoming and the check in process was quick and easy. Check in was'nt until 3:00 and we arrived around 1 so we had to wait for our room for a little while. We ate and walked around the beach in the meantime. I would recommend that you put a bathing suit in your carry on in case you have to wait for your room. It is VERY hot and humid!! The food was fine, they have a different buffet theme every night. I like the oriental night the best. Breakfast was ok for the first two days but then it gets old after that. They serve the same breakfast items every signle day. Eggs, potatoes, and french toast. They do have a gentlemen making omelettes everyday but the line it sometimes a long wait which is no big deal for me. The people working in the buffet are always happy to serve you but sometimes they walk right by and you wont get a drink until you are done eating. They do have a bar in the buffet so you can get your own if you want to. We never had a problem getting a reservation for the restaurants. We never saw a line. The mexican restaurant was awesome, I had to surf and turf which i really enjoyed. The italian restaurant was'nt very good and nobdy we met liked it either. The beach is beautiful and clean. The water is crystal clear. Our room had a view of the ocean and the pool. We never really heard any construction. The room was really nice and the bathroom was beautiful. The toilet did get clogged one day but when we called somebody fixed it right away. We did have a problem with the phone cards, the machine in the resort was broken so we couldnt call home. We had to walk to town in order to use the phone in the blazing heat and the cards we bought idnt even work in them. The front desk failed to tell us that. There is one girl worked at the front desk who is very rude, I dont remember her name but you will know when you meet her. They have good excursions. We did Xel-ha and the Atv explorer. Xel-ha was really nice for snorkeling. If you like fourwheeling the atv excursion was fun. They let you get off and swim in this really beautiful cave. They have jet skis on the beach but we never used them. They are plenty of things to do in Playa Del Carmen. 5th avenue is great for shopping and they have really nice restaurants. We bought a lot of souvenirs there for really cheap. I got my picture taken with a monkey on 5th avenue. You give the guy 5 dollars and you can take as many pictures as you want with your own camera. On friday during our vacation we learned that a category 5 hurricane (Dean) was coming for cancun. The hotel seemed to empty out more and more by the time sunday rolled around. We tried to leav earlier but there were no flights out of cancun. Luckily we were leaving on monday but we were scared they would cancel our flight. They started boarding up the windows at the resort and all through town. They took away all the beach and pool chairs. They moved the buffet to the theatre in the lobby. It was crazy! Our flight did leave on time but there was said to be 70,000 people at the airport. We left just in time because they closed the airport an hour after we left. The coco bay was evacuating people as we were leaving and putting them in shelters.

I spent a lot of time at the beach and the pool and never heard anyone complain, not at check in or check out either. The surrounding neighborhood is under construction but the hotel gounds were clean and well maintained. Our rooms were originally on opposite sides of the hotel but we asked them to change and there was no problem doing that. We had two rooms and both had ice cold a/c and plenty of hot water. Had to ask for towels on occassion but they always brought them right away. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Entertainment staff was a riot. Always upbeat and friendly. The food was fine, not 5 star but neither is the price. Early reservations are required at most resorts as they were here for the Mexican and Italian restaurants. We had reservations 4 of the 7 nights and thought the Mexican one was the best. I found plenty to eat on the buffet or cook to order grill and no stomach problems, except to much fresh fruit on occassion. The snack bar was good for pico, guacamole & chips or roasted chicken. The drinks were good if you found the right bartender (go Roger)and you tipped occassionally. The fruit drinks are too sweet for me but the margaritas were good. The beach is some of the best in Playa. There are boats moored in front but there is a swimming area roped off and the resort is next door to a not so public \"public\" beach. Lots of room to walk the beach, kayak or snorkel. Our trip was throughFun Jet. On the way to the resort they tried to steer us to their onsite travel agency for tours but once we were there we had absolutly no pressure from them. If I were to return to Playa I would definately stay at the Grand Coco Bay again. The size of the resort and the atmosphere make it a perfectly relaxing place to unwind.

I arrived and took the opportunity to upgrade to an ocean front room. I don't know what most of you are fussing about the boats - yes, they are there, and no, there are no problems with them in the water. The jetski concession was a bit more irksome (exhaust, etc.) and you'll get that at any resort offering motorized water activities. The rooms are fine, just your basic hotel room - has everything I needed: cool air-conditioning, hot water, working lamps, clean towels. Food: I really can't add much more than has been posted. Had I not been familiar with Playa and its restaurants I would not have been pleased at all. Breakfast I went continental, lunch I either went into town or grabbed whatever was on the grill that day. Dinner I always went into town. If you are looking for the overdone all-inclusive experience, Coco Bay is not the place for you.

Servers are always gracious and friendly. They all deserve tips. From what I observed there was little to no people tipping. These hard working people deserve them. Drinks were free flowing and good. ROGER, at the pool side bar, was the best and easily the busiest. The pool was always enjoyable, but we are a young couple and there were way too many kids for us. In addition the entertainment staff is kind of annoying. They try way too hard, and don't really entertain. The beach is amazing. It is just a few steps away from the pool, and there are very few kids there. The sand and water were just perfect. Playa del Carmen is a very cute little town that deserves at least one visit.

We have stayed at better all-inclusives, but chose this property because it was affordable for a rather spontaneous vacation. We booked through Funjet. Initial impressions/grounds: Like others have stated, the drive into the resort was a bit ghetto, and then we had a lengthy wait during check-in. We were supplied with champagne, but couldn't help but notice the guests complaining in front of us, attempting to resolve problems. We did feel ok about the resort at first - there was a nice lobby and a fairly nice beach. But things went downhill from there. Room: We haggled for the best room we could get, finally settling on an \"ocean view\" fourth floor but on the construction side. We were assured construction was between 8 am and 5 pm, so we felt comfortable with the situation (forgetting our two hour time difference). The room was small, and at first the toilet ran non-stop but when we complained, it was fixed immediately. Unfortunately there was a serious mold issue on the bathroom ceiling (no bathroom fan) that I tried to ignore for the week. We had read about water pressure issues that I felt were humorous - (who cares about water pressure when on vacation??) but the reality was that the water would be present for approximately 10 seconds, and then actually SHUT OFF completely for 30 seconds, causing a very interesting shower experience. A simple shower became rather stressful, and much longer than anticipated. We tried to approach this situation with a sense of humor, realizing really one gets what they pay for. We had reduced our expectations, tried to get into the vacation spirit and just accept things. Thankfully this kept the vacation from becoming a horrible experience. Food/alchohol: The food buffet was lacking, to be kind. Let me clarify that we are not picky eaters; we both come from large families where one eats what is put before them. But this food was just not ok. Eggs were always mixed with something strange, and everything was greasy. We soon adapted to a dry cinnamon roll for breakfast with coffee. We skipped lunch because quite honestly, the buffet was unappealing, and the outdoor burgers/fries/hotdogs snack bar was also unappealing. In part, I somehow lost my appetite on the second day, and then montezuma's revenge struck on day 3, and that pretty much took care of my appetite for the duration of the vacation. My boyfriend also had intestinal issues, but they didn't last as long as mine. So in getting Boyfriend's opinion, the snack bar food was B grade at best, and the smell of oil for frying was revolting and he opted to wait until dinner. Also, plates with half eaten food were left around the pool for hours, with no one bothering to return their plates and no service to pick up the plates. So birds would fly around and pick at the rotting food - disgusting to say the least. The Italian restaurant was ok, as other reviews have stated - the service was excellent, and the food was \"good.\" The Mexican restaurant was lesser quality, but ok. As others have stated, the restaurant was 2/3 empty, causing questions about the \"limited reservations???.\" Also my boyfriend was gracious enough to get up at 6:30(!!!) every morning to make reservations for the Italian restaurant. The one day he got down to the line at 7:15, we could only get reservations for 8:30 in the evening. This is not acceptable for guests trying to vacation and hopefully sleep in. At other resorts we have stayed at, we were at least able to make reservations for 3 days in advance at one time. This situation was ridiculous since the restaurants were almost empty when we did actually go in to eat. As others have stated, there are boats all weirdly grouped right in front of the resort. At one point I counted 50, all within the range of the small beach directly in front of the resort. This might not seem like such a big deal, but when you want to lay back in the lounger and gaze out into the teal-blue carribean, this is just not possible here. Plus there is very little area to wade into the water, let alone swim, and once in the water there is a very strong smell of dead fish, gas/diesel, and various foreign substances floating in the water. Call me squeamish, but this is not what I had dreamed about for my Carribean experience. Alcohol - we have stayed at other all-inclusives, and were stunned by the poor quality drinks at this resort. We naively requested various top-shelf liquors at first - (bombay saphire, grey goose) only to get confusion and negative responses. We even finally started asking for beefeater and moderate level liquors and those were also not available. The bartenders used all low-level grade liquor, and even then when my boyfriend asked for a \"double\" the bartender proceeded to fill up his cup almost to the brim with a low-quality gin, but when we both sampled it, it tasted completely like water. We FINALLY realized they must water down their alcohol - as we have read in other reviews - but didn't realize this actually was practiced! Neither of us ever felt anything close to a \"buzz\", and finally we purchased our own gin and vodka in town and mixed our own drinks on our last 2 days. Playa del Carmen - We had alot of fun taking in 5th avenue! The shopping was great, we had fun making \"deals\" on souveniers for our kids, and just taking in a few bars and clubs. Since the only day I was capable of staying out (before getting sick) was day 2, we first ate at Ajua (recommended by our Funjet reps). OK - just let me say, please, please do not get taken in by this. The Funjet reps get some kickback, and they said it is the only restaurant they recommend. Well we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant, which should have been our first warning, and we never received our \"free drink\" or 10% off from the coupon we were given. The food was mediocre, at BEST. My boyfriend ordered lobster and steak, which wasn't great, and I ordered the Mexican platter. I explained that I wasn't very hungry, and just wanted a small plate of something, and they promised they would bring a \"petite\" plate of the mexican platter. I got the FULL plate, and we were charged $70 for boyfriend's steak and lobster and $20 for my mexican platter. We tried to protest, but ended up just paying and getting out of there for $120. We went around the corner and saw multiple signs for steak and lobster dinners for $30, at almost every restaurant. On our last day we got steak and lobster at the Blue Lobster for $24 p/person. I still was sick and could only manage a couple bites, but it was decent food. We went to the Blue Parrot for the fire show - we loved it - and also danced for several hours. Probably the highlight of the trip for me at least. We tried to duplicate the experience on our last night, but I was too sick to handle it, and we went back to the hotel after the Blue Lobster. In general: We did the Xel-Ha trip, and were less than impressed. Let me clarify - I insisted on it because I had friends who have RAVED about it. But we are fairly experienced travelers and usually go out on a chartered snorkel trip, and Xel Ha just was way too commercialized for us. It was expensive, we went on the bus-chartered trip which took at least 4 stops plus a bus change (which Funjet reps totally misrepresent) and the tour guide treated us like a 3rd grade field trip. When we finally snorkeled, it was crowded, we were overrun by inter-tubers, and when we would finally find a school of fish it was almost anticlimatic, like we were in a fish tank and finally found the fish. A trip out into the ocean on a rustic boat with experienced guides, the discovery of fish - a totally different experience and I would highly recommend going through local tour companies to have this experience rather than the disney Xel-Ha park. The food was almost as bad as the resort also - very similar in quality. We ran into another gentleman we had met earlier in the week on our last day, and he was trying to decide on the Xel Ha vs. local snokel trip. He finally told us his family of 5 had been sick for days, much like us. He said they were miserable, couldn't handle the food, and were trying to also make the best of the experience. This is the reason I'm writing this review - if you have already booked this resort, see for yourself, and if you are not happy, call Funjet immediately and have them move you to a different resort. We are still kicking ourselves for not doing that. If you are trying to decide, pay an additional couple hundred and go to a better resort.

I wished we had bothered to spend anther $200-$500 and stayed somewhere that would have given us the few things we desired. Grand Cocco Bay had food that was equal to Shoney's, the drinks were usually horrible ( and very little to choose from) the service SUCKED (i've been in the service industry for 14 years...trust me I know what bad service is) And one thing just kept going wrong after another.....airconditioning stoped working 2 days before we were to leave, a drip was constant in our bathroom and from the ceiling in our room, we had 2 full size beds in our room, there was never bottled water in the gift shop (Wal-Mart is a $3 cab drive away and cheaper to buy than it would have been at the gift shop) So to sum it up....DON'T BOTHER!!!

We were the last to get droped off from our shuttle van...all the other places looked so wonderful and plush...then we drive closer into town and go down dirty, heavily construction streets, pass loose dogs ( does make for a nice anthropological look at another culture ) and then pull up to our place...after going through about a foot of water that was blocking the street that you would have never been able to walk through, and pull up to the not so Grand Cocco Bay.

If they are too watered down, ask to make them stronger...no problem...the hotel's entertainement staff was EXCEPTIONAL!...We met 2 women from Italy that have been going there every summer for the last few years....everyone knows them...they sat at our table so I met the guys from the ENtertainment staff...they are great friends and play off each other..loads of fun...all great guys and a new girl, Nathalia who had just started was terrific! My favorite was a guy named Diego....just a sweetheart! Kind to everyone...it didnt matter if you were 70 or 3, he made you feel like you were important....they guy from Chili that the aforementioned person spoke about, is I am assuming Ricardo....from Chile...he was hilarious....talked about how he was \"Muy Caliente\"....and he was, but he said it all tongue in cheek...though he did bear a striking resemblance to Ricky Martin which we affectionaly callled him the rest of the week...I think the person misunderstood their sense of humour,.....the guys were hilarious and always kidding around....like I said, you could be 70 or 3 years of age. and they always flirted, but never crossed the line....I loved how they all got along with one another...and their comedy shows were the best....as far as I am, concerned, they were the highlight....and I was therewith my husband and 5 year old and I am in my 40's...... The pool bardenter, Roger was phenomenal....try a capriani....a mojito without the mint....phenomenal....met so many nice people at the poolside bar...as far as the food..no it is not 5 star...but it was decent! We went out to Playa Del CArmen to eat at the Big Lobster...though nice, we spent $100 for a kids plate of pasta with butter, 7 shrimp for me, guacamole (which tastes better when my souther nhusband makes it here) and he had steak and lobster which were very good. We had no alcohol, just water and I would have rather eaten at the hotel. The service was wonderful....if you ran out of your drinks in the fridge, all you have to do is call and they will bring them everyday....room service was good... Now, for the down side.....the kids club was okay...my son loved it but it is only open from 10 a.m to 2 p.m. and so if you go into town, you have to be back by 2..then it starts at 3 -5..the other thing I did not like was that they used real darts....a little dangerous I thought....other than that, he loved it and went with us to shows which although had adult humour, was done in such a way that it went over their heads...you couldn't really go out at night because there was no kids club at night (guess some of the recent cruises we were on spoiled us)..... the other 2 big complaints were a. the rooms were hot and the common areas did not have adequate air conditioning...but then again, my husband and I are both VERY hot natured but we heard others complain about it too...my other big complaint was the hardness of the beds.....I woke up a lot and my back was sore....not a lot to do after 10:00 p.m....and I am a night owl.... as for internet service...cheap...$5.00 for an hour....however, only 2 computers so lines could get a little long at night...they could use a few more computers....if you want to exchange cash, they only give you 10 pesos for a dollar....and they will not change pesos back into dollars...so do it only there for convenience otherwise in town (however, remember the exchange stgores don't take credit cards...you willl have to go to the banks) or you are screwed. ...there were a few ants in our room but not enough to bother us.... All in all, I would defintely go back and met many families who go there every year from the states...it is a nice mixture of Mexicans, Europeans and about 40-50% Americans....it is not the 4 Seasons but it was one of the best vacations I have ever been on....you really do not need to leave the resort at all....I liked the boats out front.....gave it personality and they were quiet.

One note....being all inclusive, people come and decide they don't have to tip. which is exactly a personal preference...however, the workers there work 12-16 hours a day for 6 days a week...one person (don't know if this is true or not told me that the average pay is around 4-5 $ a day....they are not allowed to put tip jars out on the counter nor ask for tips...if you decide to tip (which we did), it is a bonus for them...however, I also found out that there is an even more wonderful way to thank them which will cost you nothing....if you write a comment about anyone, (and please include the people who serve you in the buffet), after 5 comments, they get a paid day off and can eat and playh there with their families....I had 13 people write comments on napkins for one of the bartenders and he told me that he will now get 2 paid days off and his fmaily can join him....so, even if you are on a budget, there is a way to recognize them...I was also told that the comments they received on Tripadvisor.com (which I always consult) is extrmely useful to them as well.", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "Bella_Dea", "ReviewID": "UR8244328", "Content": "Overall I loved the my stay at the Grand Coco Bay. Some sites list it as a 5star. It's more of a 4-4 and a half. So don't go expecting a five star. FOOD: There is one buffet with an amazing view of the ocean. The food had a good variety each day and each night there was a different buffet theme (gala, italian, mexican, international etc.) There are also two a la carte restaurants. The italian one had amazing food, service atmosphere..everything. We never went to the mexican one, but I heard it was good. There is also a snackbar by the pool. They had great quesadillas and ice cream. Some of my family ate there a lot, they really liked it. They have a huge variety of food there. There's a pool bar, sports bar and lobby bar. POOL: It was a refreshing temperature and clean. Quite large, but under the bridge there was a wall, so you either had to crawl over the wall or go around to the stairs and walk around. Not a huge deal, but inconvenient. It was sometimes hard to find a well located chair around the pool. The entertainment staff had aquafit, waterpolo and volleyball going on sometimes. There are a couple \"hot tubs\" which are just small pools with jets. Sadly while we were there a young boy slipped and drowned in one of them. BEACH: Absolutely amazing white sand beaches. The hotel provides lounge chairs and there were always enough. The water was so nice. In some places there were rocks, not big jagged rocks or ones you could cut yourself on. But if your some one who doesn't like things touching there feet, I'd bring watershoes. There aren't any fish within swimming regioin. But if you take a kayak further out you can see some small fish. For me, the coolest thing was the boats that dock themselves out front. They didn't come into the swimming area, but it was cool to see the local boats coming in. ROOMS: They weren't tiny, but they weren't big. For the amount of time we spent in the room, it wasn't a big deal. The bathroom was spacious and clean, the towels provided were large and cushy. The beds were a little hard and there was a lack of space to put your clothes. But it was clean.All the rooms have good views. I'm pretty sure you can see the pool from most views, and some pool views have partial ocean. You can pay an extra $25USD per night for an ocean view. I would suggest not paying for it, since the room is the exact same. You get room service for free, it's a continental breakfast, but fun none the less. TOWN: The walk down the beach to Playa Del Carmen is beautiful. If you take the road way it's about five minutes walking or a $3 dollar cab ride. Honestly, I fell in love with the town, it's got an amazing feel to it, and i felt completely safe. You can get some beautiful things. Near the end of the town (by senor frogs) is more of the haggling area. Going into PDC will totally make your trip worth it. I'm sure i left a million things out, but this is a great hotel with everything going for it.", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lawrence, KS", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Coco Bay\u201d", "Author": "asey", "ReviewID": "UR8233830", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Coco Bay in June and we also got married there.

We have always stayed at different resorts and only repeated one resort,the Iberostar, because the resort is so fantastic, we found this resort a wonderful break from the huge megaplexes that we've stayed at in the past. I found the resort to be designed quite friendly and easy to get around. The food was always very tasty, every night was a different \"theme\" buffet. Monday-Mexican Tues-Oriental Wens-International Thurs-Carribean Fri- Gala Sat-Italian Sunday-BBQ There is a snack bar that offered Hamburgers,hot dogs,pizza,fries and Sandwiches like Ham and cheese,Turkey Club, Shrededded Chicken ect. There was also always rotisserie chicken you could get. They have two specialty restaurants, Italiana and Latin and we never found it hard to get a reservation for the specialty restaurants, they take reservations from 7am-9am every morning. And unlike the big resorts we were never restricted to how many times you could eat at them. Note...do it alot, the food was fantastic~~ Presentation was amazing also!!! I found the staff picking up the pool area quite often. There were times that I had to tell them I was still drinking that beer and leave it. And sometimes common courtesy is if your going back to the bar, take your glass or the glasses around you back. Same things with your plates, on your way to the bathroom, drop them off at the counter. If we all did this we wouldn't have complaints. Breakfast and dinner room service was an option and the menu is on the first channel of your TV. The plates/cups by the rooms were always picked up by noon and the only time I saw them out was when I came back from the show at night. The bartenders were very good and I never found they restricted service close to 6pm. In fact he always called to us for last call and always rememebered what we liked to drink. I even saw him cut a girl off because she had drank too much the last day we were there. They are aware when these people are too drunk. The only time I saw them try to serve a underage girl was in the disco bar upstairs and when these 15 year old girls are getting smoozed by the scummy entertainment staff, I guess they are all out for the big score with these girls. But a little parent supervision would be nice because I saw the mothers drinking right next to them and they were allowing it. The entertainment staff was very nice, but having a 14 year old daughter and watching how they handled themselves with the teenagers was quite disturbing. The rule should be if they are weatring the green band... they are off limits! Although our mini bar was never restocked, I am sure if you would leave a note or call, they would take care of this. After the first day with only 3 towels, a simple note of Quantro towels Parfavor (I am sure I have even spelled this wrong) still got the four towels every day. Funjet/Lomas travel did a great job. They are by far some of the best reps I have ever encountered. Both guys, both named Juan, did a fantastic job and even though I never went to a Welcome Seminar or met them upon my arrival, I was well informed of every thing I needed to know at the resort and about my return transfers. They stated if I needed them, just contact them in the lobby. If you are a first time traveler or someone new this area, I would suggest you go to talk to them. They can help you alot. The pool area was very well laid out and there was plenty of room to stretch out. We only went down to the beach once, and the water was nice to swim in with a sandy bottom. The beach was spacious and you can always find a chair to sit in. On your way to the hotel you are in a midst of a suburban Playa area and I wouldn;t suggest you walk the streets but we took the beach into town ( its a short 5 minute walk) and enjoyed the sights and sounds of everything we passed. The beach is safe and in the short walk we passed beach patrol on ATV's patroling the area. My husband ran every morning and he also said the beach was populated and safe even in the morning hours. The shows were good, they are in an air conditioned room off the lobby and every other day they bring in professional dancers to entertain. When I first walked into the theater I didn't know what ot expect since it seemed so small to me, but we actually enjoyed the shows each night. I am sure there will be lots of postings on this but my family and I were at the resort the day of the accident of the little boy from Texas. We had just arrived a few hours before and I have to say it was a bad way to start a family vacation. First I want to point out that my own 10 year old son has played in the whirlpool during our family vacations each year to the Riviera Maya. Most of the times with us in or by the pool but not always right with him. It could of happened to our son very easily and all week when it came up, because it did, I was quick to defend the fact that I would have let him go without any worry. I was very disturbed how the entire process was handled with the emergency techs and police. Not one employee at this resort knew CPR, when the EMT's arrived (20 minutes later when the hospital is two blocks from the hotel) they didn't even try after learning the boy had no pulse and when the doctor vacationing that was doing CPR found out they didnt even have a De Fib machine, there was not much more they could of done. I also dont feel like the boys body had to be brought through the pool area for all to see. There is a path that leads to the back and he could of been taken out that way. I was doing everything in my power to keep my 10 year old son entertained and busy to keep his mind off of what was happening at that end of the pool and then had to wisk him out of the pool when they took the body out. That is a little too devastating to a young boy with a heart of gold to realize that someone his age just died. In closing I would suggest the resort to any mid range priced vacationers. I thought the level of service, food quality, call brand liquor, and room sizes were just as good if not better than the big resorts.", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Twin Cities, MN", "Title": "\u201cBeware!\u201d", "Author": "mcwohlf", "ReviewID": "UR8217084", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Grand Coco Bay for a week. The resort is just like the photo's, but photo's can only show you one side. There are condo's being built right next door, so if you are an early riser you will be fine on that side, if not...sorry! Be aware of some things though....they like to pull a \"bait and switch\" on people. You will be given one of the least desirable rooms, and if you complain you will be \"allowed\" to change for a fee. The fee goes down hourly, until it eventually becomes nothing. We had read this here, and decided to simply take the crummy room since we are early risers and being in the back corner gave us privacy. Some of the other problems we had were the bathroom ceiling leaking, which was fixed the same day, the maid will take ANY visable currency, and also candy (half eaten rolls of lifesavers etc.) that is around. Our room was only cleaned 4 out of the 7 days we stayed, which may have been a good thing. :) This resort also uses electronic cards for room keys, which can't seem to hold the code. We had many problems, and every time we were told we did something wrong. You can't put it in a beach bag, you can't put it in a purse, you can't put it in your pocket, you can't allow any contact with anything hot, wet, or magnetic....I think you get the drift. I finally blew up and told them I did not care if they had to go buy a deadbolt and put it on the door, I wanted to be able to get back into my room and was NOT going to plan my vacation around this defective locking system. The food was good at the buffet, and the italian ala carte was good as well. Drinks are plentiful and quite tasty, but not monitored in any way, so there was a shoving match fueled by alcohol and testosterone. There are rules, but nothing ever is enforced, we ate at the ala carte with folks in shorts (jean shorts no less) and bathing suit tops. Children are not supposed to be allowed in the hot tubs, but nobody did anything about it, until a young boy drowned. Nobody went in them after that. Also beware, the lifeguards do NOT know how to do CPR.

The pool was very clean and cool till late afternoon. there were always chairs available. the beach had nice white sand that did not burn your feet. ..also many chairs. There were little rocks and pieces of coral for the first 10-20 feet in the water. the water was a little cloudy...not as clear as at Cozumel. the food was good and we ate two times each at the Mexican and the Italian. Do bring long pants...they even made our grandson wear them...said any male over 7 and no shorts on the ladies. We enjoyed room service one morning for breakfast and it was quite nice. I didn't think the entertainment staff was very good. There seemed to be just a couple of the guys doing all the work. The shows were the same every night. \"any thing can happen\" there were not a lot of activities, but this was not a problem for us as we aren't big joiners. The tennis court is on the roof and you must get the rackets and balls from the towel shack. Be sure that the roof is unlocked, as we waited for over 30 minutes for someone to open it for us.... The hot tubs are very warm...the first time we have found this to be true in Mexico in the summer. I thought the bartenders did a good job and the waits were short. We enjoyed a drink or two at the lobby bar every night before dinner. A nice atmosphere and glass glasses and even a frosty mug now and then... the waiters tried to keep up and I have no complaints there. The cab ride down town was a good deal...$3 for 4 people. no problems going there. time share people at the resort try different ways to get you, just say \"no\" and they go away. One couple did go for the free gift and were not very happy as a promised 90 minute talk turned into over 4 hours and half a day of vacation lost. There is lots of construction going on all around the resort, but never a problem for us. Was glad I took a power bar, a mug, sunscreen, aloe, ear and eye drops, cards, We enjoyed the snack bar. the grandkids loved the french fries and hamburgers. The ice cream cones were a hit with all of us. At times you had to wait a minute or 2, but no big deal. At most resorts you would still be walking to the snaack bar.....everything is nice and close. They do have a catamaran that you can use, but you must take a lesson first...think it was like $60.

We stayed Saturday May26 - Wednesday May 30 (Memorial Weekend). There were three of us vacationing: myself, my boyfriend and his brother and we are age 25-35. We picked Coco Bay because of the smaller size resort, swim up bar and proximity to downtown Playa Del Carmen. None of us are keen on the crazy crowded big resorts and this place seemed just perfect because it still had some of the amenities of the big resorts (like the great pool and swim up bar!) CHECK IN: I was a little concerned at the problems other reviewers experienced during check in (when they were sent to other hotels, etc) so I arrived at the hotel with an open mind and prepared for some problems. But it was quite the opposite. We were greeted at the front desk by Kim Louis who was very friendly, offered us our choice of floors to stay on and had no problems accommodating our double bed request. Also, we got there hours before official check in. At most All-inclusive resorts this usually means they give you the bracelet and tell you to go grab a bit and come back in a few hours. But we got to check in right away. I've been to Mexico and stayed in other countries at all-inclusives so already know that anyone trying to greet you when you first arrive (other than the person at the front desk) is going to try and sign you up for a time share presentation so we firmly said no thank you to everyone trying to \"assist\". The guys in blue shirts lingering at the entrance and the girl bringing Champaign all are trying to get you to do a time share presentation. Take the champaign but save yourself the headache and just say NO to the orientation or any other welcome information they want to give you. We were checked in and unpacking in our rooms about 10 mins after the taxi driver dropped us off. ROOMS: We had room 2232 which is on the 3rd floor and overlooked the pool - see the picture of the view from the room. The room was plain but clean and the bathroom was decent. There's really not a lot to say about it and I have no complaints. People who complain about water pressure or humid rooms seem to have never been to Mexico or the Caribbean before. Turn on the air conditioner and the humidity goes away. It's swell how that works. FOOD: There are two restaurants besides the buffet: Italian and Mexican which is fewer than most all inclusives but we stayed at this place because it was very close to town and we weren\u2019t planning on eating all of our meals at the hotel. We did eat once at each of the restaurants and they were decent if you\u2019re not overly picky. They also have a grill for late night and when the buffet is closed but it takes a while to get food there because they only have one guy doing everything. I was actually impressed by the variety of food you could get at the grill. Other AI resorts usually are just burgers and hotdogs but he served chicken, several sandwiches, any formation of chips/nachos and pizza among other things. So it was a pretty good variety. The ice cream seemed to be a hit with everyone too. The buffet is open during specific breakfast lunch and dinner times. It's true what other reviewers say, that there are no clocks so we missed the buffet at times and had to wait in line at the grill. ENTERTAINMENT: The entertainment guys really tried to keep things going with beach volleyball, aerobics classes, bingo and trying to get together water polo (which failed when none of the guests were willing). They work so long - we saw them at 9am playing volleyball and then 2am dancing in the \u201cclub\u201d with all of the single ladies. The club is very tiny by the way and most of the people in there were the workers but it was a place to go at 2am after getting back from town or the Lobby bar. We never made it to any of the shows so I can't comment on that. The pool was great. I didn't think it was too cold (as others mentioned) and it probably warms up even more later in the year. It was hard to get service at the swim up bar though so most people got out of the pool and went to the other side of the swim up bar where the bartender would serve. The jacuzzis were empty the first day and had several maintenance workers trying to fix them. The second or third night we were there they were fixed but then broken again by the next day. They were also not hot enough. It was like a luke warm bath so it really wasn't worth sitting in. It's too bad too because they face the ocean and it's a great view with the boats anchored right there. It would have been a nice place to have a drink at sunset. EXCURSIONS: We never got up early enough to take a planned excursion but we took the ferry to Cozumel for a day. By the way, don\u2019t go on a Sunday. Nearly everything in Cozumel was closed by 6pm on Sunday and it was completely dead everywhere we went. It costs $20 for round trip on the ferry. We took the yellow one (which is the same price as the other) and there was a band on the boat heading out to Cozumel which we found thoroughly entertaining. We also took the public bus to Tulum one afternoon which is only $7 round trip and takes about an hour each way. The admission to Tulum is less than $5. Kudos to the Coco bay travel agent (in the office in the lobby) that assisted us even though we weren\u2019t buying one of his packages. He knew we had already missed every tour for the day and we were leaving the next day so suggested for us to take the bus to Tulum which worked out perfectly. We all thought the Tulum ruins was definitely worth seeing and it\u2019s perfect if you just want to do something that takes up about 4-5 hours or so. TIP: To get to and from Cancun airport, the absolute best deal and most comfortable is taking the public bus. It costs $8 each way and it drops you right in downtown Playa where you can take a 30 peso ($3) cab ride to the hotel. All of the cabs charge a flat fee but always ask the price before you get in the cab to make sure they aren\u2019t going to overcharge you. It\u2019s always $3 to and from Coca Bay to downtown. I would suggest that you buy your bus tickets back to the Cancun airport in advance, before the day you depart. Most of the flights leave Cancun going back to the states around the same time (12-2pm) so when we went to catch our bus to the airport, the 11am bus was completely sold out and the next one wasn\u2019t till noon (the busses only run once an hour). We didn\u2019t have an hour to spare so had to pay a cab $40 to drive us to the airport. Believe me, the bus is by far a better mode of transportation with a much more comfortable ride (especially for you tall fellas) and they show a movie to keep you entertained on the trip. So we wished we had bought our bus tickets the day before we left to go back home. And yes, you really do need to be at the Cancun airport at least two hours before your plane takes off. Overall, the resort is really what I expected and in a great location, about 15-20 min walk to town. Others have said they didn\u2019t like the boats moored on the beach but I thought it was cute and picturesque. The beach was really quiet and no vendors tried to sell to you which was very relaxing. I would have been sick of the food though if I ate there for every meal of the four nights we were there. But I think that about every AI I\u2019ve been to. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you\u2019re looking for a relaxing place that is close to town and you aren\u2019t intending to spend every moment at the hotel.", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Paul, MN", "Title": "\u201cThe Entertainment Staff made our vacation great!!

This was the most relaxing vacation we have ever taken! A lot of the clientele were older (which may be becasue we were there after Spring Break) so it was very quiet. But my boys (10 and 12) had a great time, and I give all of the credit to the Entertainment Staff! All of the hotel staff were fabulous, but this group of guys went above and beyond to make sure my kids were having a good time. And not only did these guys work by the pool all day, but they were the ones putting on the nightly shows in the theater. (The shows are very funny, and don't miss the Mayan show, it was amazing!) As I said, I didn't understand the previous complaints. Aside from a couple of ants, we had NO problems with bugs in our room. Our water pressure was fine, and we always had hot water. The food was great-our kids loved the snack bar-and none of us got sick.

I still refused to learn the merengue though \u2013 sorry to the entertainer who tried! On the down side, we got sick! Sick sick sick! So did 90% of the people on our bus to and from the airport. We think that the hotel had a bit of bad luck and some virus got into the food. One receptionist didn't seem to want to log the fact that so many people got ill, however her colleague wanted to take note and we filled in the form they use to monitor the situation. The beech is beautiful, by far the best I've seen in that part of the world. The pool was great too, loads of chairs available and an awesome swim up bar. As for activities away from the hotel, we had a great time at Chichen Itza and the Pirate Cruise. Chichen Itza took about 2.5 hours on the coach and the Pirate Cruise is about 45 minutes away, so it\u2019s up to you if you feel like travelling, but we\u2019d recommend it because they are both so worthwhile. Alternatively, the town is so close by (about 15 mins walk). It\u2019s well worth a look.

First of all I must say that the water was beautiful and we took advantage of the beach and water. I'd like to note that the usual pesky beach vendors were all but non-existent, (a very nice surprise). Now for the not so good...., The first room they assigned to us to was on the ground floor with only a view of the back of some landscape shrubs and a wooden walkway. The large mirror had mold spots and there was a greasy texture to surface of several items including the top of the TV. Citing a high occupancy rate, the front desk offered to move us to a room with a partial view of the ocean for an additional $25 per night. After voicing our displeasure, they magically found us a different room with a partial ocean view and no extra $ per night, but with two double beds instead of a king as originally agreed upon. And, it was a smoking room when a non-smoking had been requested. Thankfully it didn't smell like smoke since my wife is allergic to it. After 24 hours at the \"Grand\" Coco Bay we quickly observed that the hotel occupancy rate was probably in the 50-60% range at best, and we were sensing a (soft) bait and switch tactic had been attempted as a means of maximizing hotel profits. The second room was only marginally better. It had a crack in the big bathroom mirror that ran the entire length, and the third day we noticed a few tiny bugs. We thought we killed the bugs until we left some vitamins laying by the TV for several hours....I think you get the picture. Housekeeping service was OK but the room itself was overall sub-par. The food was plentiful, visually stimulating, and for the most part good tasting, but made us both very sick. My wife became ill two days after arrival and upon returning home, she had a 101 degree fever and ended up at the doctor where prescriptions were written for a bacterial infection. While talking to individuals at the resort, we found all but one couple had experienced stomach issues throughout their stay. We've been home two days and continue to experience stomach problems. The transition step down to the beach is huge and can be a real problem for older folks or people with knee issues. The beach towels were thin and frayed and only one allowed per person. The sand contained gravel which caught us off guard while wading in the ocean. Further down in front of other resorts, the sand was perfect with no gravel. Boats are moored in front of the hotel but we found this entertaining as opposed to a drawback. The waves are very gentle due to a reef but a short walk down the beach to other resorts provides large waves to jump. There is no waiter service at the beach so be prepared to fetch your own drinks and food. This really wasn't a big deal as the resort is so small that everything is close. While on a walk down the beach, a thunderstorm suddenly approached and upon our return to the lounge chairs, we discovered all our items were missing, including the cell phone. As my wife's father is in poor health, this was our lifeline to the States. Everything else was replaceable. We contacted the front desk and were provided a room key to allow up to get into our room but no other information regarding our belongings was available. Most of the electricity was out but we were still able to take showers and clean up for dinner. My wife then located security outside and inquired about our items left on the beach. Security then brought out all of our stuff along with some extra thongs that weren't ours. We were very appreciative of this gesture as the wind, rain and hail was quite strong and could have destroyed the cell phone. Therefore, the storm response was quite impressive. The overall service was considered poor and no amount of tipping helped. Often times at meals in the restaurant, we would go to the bar and obtain our own soft drinks/alcohol as a waiter would come by after we had finished eating. This was not the case in the reservation only restaurants. Speaking of which, the Italian restaurant was absolutely wonderful. Not enough good things can be said about the food and service in that restaurant. The Funjet rep at the hotel was very short with my wife when she told him we wouldn't be taking any of his tour offerings but when I spoke to him to conform our return reservations, he was in a better mood. However, he failed to give me the return trip voucher for transportation to the airport. My wife mentioned we needed this after being asked by hotel staff for the voucher. The representative originally said he had provided me the voucher then checked and discovered he had not. All this occurred while waiting for the transportation van. When reading this it would appear it was a horrible trip and we are people who look at the glass as half empty instead of half full. This is not the case. We still managed to have fun as long as we were within 50 feet of a bathroom. Just don't forget your Immodium and Pepto Bismal as we did. If you do, Wal-Mart is only a $3 cab ride away.

That was the part we liked the most. The staff was very friendly, and we didn't have any pressure at all from the time share people. Though we did hear others talking about what they got for \"free\" when they did the tours. If you have plenty of spare time it might be worth it. Things to note: 1. There are no clocks anywhere except at the front desk. 2. The pool is VERY COLD - the ocean was actually warmer. 3. The food is ok. Breakfast and Lunch were the best. We ate dinner there 1 night, and did not care for it, so we ate off the property most of the time, and found some great restaurants in the area, and food is very reasonable off the property. 4. Rooms were clean, shower was fine, we always had hot water. 5. Our room 2135 did not have a view, there was a palm tree right in front of the balcony, but the room was convienent to all the amenities. 6. There were many people tanning topless, sometimes completely nude, on the beach, something to be aware of if you have children or are bothered by this. 7. The hotel is safe and secure, we didn't have any issues. The negatives: The one thing I am surprised that no one else said - THERE IS A TON OF CONSTRUCTION GOING ON AROUND THIS HOTEL! It was very noisy during the day, and occassionally there would be foul odors coming from the area. I think if I had known about the amount of construction, I would have chose a different resort. Also, the floors in the lobby area heaved and cracked while we were there, making walking treacherous. Housekeeping never responded to our calls for extra towels. Concierge never brought our luggage to our room, we had to go get it after 3 calls to them and waiting 2 hours. Don't do the horseback tour! We did it, and would never do it again, and I am an experienced rider. The ride is at least 2 hours long, and done on a western saddle, which is very hard. The trails are very rough, and much of it is in the direct sun - bring sunblock or prepare to be fried. Don't ride the horse in the water - these horses don't like the water and they literrally had to drag the horse out there, they went so deep the horse was swimming and then it spooked and reared up, resulting in me swimming. There is nothing to hold onto when you go in the water except the horses mane. It was the biggest waste of money, and when we complained they said since I wasn't hurt there was nothing they could do and we still had to pay. The video clip of this activity is highly deceiving.

They are some kind of black bird that you find in the Caribbean. I don't know what they're called. Not sure that the hotel can do anything about that. Also, we were next door to a French speaking couple that would slam their doors and speak loudly until 4:30am. They also would get up early. They pissed me off so bad on the last day that I was going to tell them off in my bloomers. They finally shut their yappers and left before I could get to them. Then the birdies started in. So, the only complaint is that the place echoes. Don't plan on sleeping in. Everything else was perfect for the price. The beach, pool, and Jacuzzi were great. Plenty of beach chairs for everyone. Do stay away from the time share people. They are outta hand, and unless you want to sit through a 4 hour presentation (they say it only takes 90 minutes, not true!), don't do it. You need to weigh that for yourself. If you want to give up 1/2 a day of vacation to be hounded by sales people to get you to spend thousands of $'s, then do it. It can be worth it to get free $ or tickets for expensive excursions. The Mexicans want your/our money and they will work very hard to squeeze as much as they can, so be on guard or you will spend more than you bargained or planned for. Oh.... and the Europeans like to take off their tops. There was a strange Italian lady that was parading around in a thong and no top. We are used to the topless thing as we have vacationed with the Europeans before. However, she was a little X rated as she would order drinks topless and touch her chest. She would also do dances for her boyfriend on the patio and on the beach. It was funny. We wanted to get a picture with her like she was an attraction.

We had a great time. Before we left, we were obsessed with checking the reviews on here...and we were a bit apprehensive about our trip. However, after our time at GCB, it's surprising to read the horrible reviews some people post but our experience was almost perfect (albeit, we are somewhat easy going). The hotel is small and exactly like the pictures show. The staff is FRIENDLY and very engaging - especially the entertainment staff. The service staff in the restaurants are quick and efficient. We chose to tip as we went along. The drinks are good...both me and my husband thought they were strong enough. Do bring an insulated mug, they last longer that way. The food was absolutely fine. Breakfast had make-your-own-omlets, lots of breads, fruits, juices, cereal, etc. The coffee was really good. Lunches we switched it up b/t the buffet and the snack bar (which isn't actually as slow as we thought it would be...if there's a line up, just don't go up at that time...wait a few minutes). Suppers we were able to go to both \"fancy\" restaurants and both were excellent. Our room was simple but nice and the air conditioning worked so well, we actually turned it off for a few nights. There are always lots of pool and beach chairs available...in and out of the shade. Service staff will serve both on the beach and at the pool. And the location of this hotel is what makes it great. You may be a little apprehensive driving up to it (it a bit of an under-construction zone) but the beach front is PERFECT...the boats give you something to look at and there's places to swim further out on both sides, literally 2 minutes down the beach. And you can walk into Playa Del Carmen along the water (turn in at the Pier) and up to 5th Ave...tourist central...very fun. I guess, if you're looking for a swanky place, this wouldn't be it. But if you're looking for somewhere to relax and enjoy yourself, GCB is great. And, one more thing, they don't provide bottled water included but you can buy BIG bottles from the gift store for $1.

Size & condition: It is a smaller resort,which I really enjoyed.It is a little older,but definitely not run down or showing it's age at all.It was very clean . Room:We were put in a room w/2 double beds,would've preferred a king,so we just made our own :)There was a fridge in the room w/soda,no water or beer.We bought water at the gift shop for a $1 and beer in town.There are no alarm clocks in the room.We had to let the hot water run for awhile in the morning before it turned hot.Maid service was good,although they didn't get to our room till the afternoon when we were in there.We only had them make up the room a couple of times but they always asked if we needed towels or toilet paper or anything else. Food & Drinks:The buffet is on the small side but there was enough variety to find something I liked.The food was not bland at all.We ate at the snack bar quite a bit,as everything was made to order.The guacamole was very good as was the salsa.Also loved the grilled chicken sanwich.The snack bar opened up later after the buffet closed and stayed open till 2 AM.We only ate at the Mexican restaurant and really enjoyed everything.I had the coconut shrimp,which was delicious.The drinks were always made nice and strong :) Loved the dirty monkeys!!Really enjoyed the lobby bar before hitting the town in Playa ($3 cab ride).Never made it to the disco.There was no service at the swim up bar,you had to get out of the pool and walk around to the front of the pool bar.We did get drink service on the beach which was nice! Pool & Beach:Pool was always clean and the temperature was very nice!The beach was beautiful!There are boats out front because that's where the reef is.Not the hotel's fault,we were told the hotel has been trying to get them to move w/no luck.Very nice stretch of beach though,you can walk to the left or right to go swimming or for a walk. Staff:We loved the entertainment staff!My DH and 2 other men in our party played volleyball with them almost every day.Did encounter some not so happy employees,but they do work very long hours so this really didn't bother us.I didn't think they were as accomodating as other resorts we have stayed at.I wanted broccoli for my omelet and they told me they only had it for lunch.And we were also told by the manager in the mexican restaurant that we couldn't bring our left over coconut shrimp to our friend who didn't join us for dinner-no take outs,LOL.No big deal but just felt like there were a little too many \"rules\". Misc:The concierge in the lobby is not actually a concierge,they are there to sell timeshares.The front desk can exchange currency,pretty good exchange rate. Overall we did enjoy our stay here.Everything was pretty average,but for what we paid,we were happy.We loved the location and met some really nice people at the resort.Since it is a smaller place there is a little more interaction among guests we noticed.I probably would stay here again if the price was right.", "Date": "April 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGood value for price we paid\u201d", "Author": "ftwdd", "ReviewID": "UR7381528", "Content": "We booked last minute, reduced rate, through Funject Vacations.

Good idea to bring your thermal mug for drinks and get reservations between 8-9 a.m. for Italian or Mexican seated restaurant. We found bar service was more responsive to male clientele. It might be we didn't drink all that much or that we didn't tip up front and only $1 here and there.

Even my wife was admiring the stylish Italian ladies. It seemed as though most Italians didn't care for Americans unless you interacted with them. There was such a huge language barrier we didn't connect with any of them until we played volleyball. We sucked at it but had a lot of fun. Thats what this place is all about!

Just two hours into our experience and we were officially on vacation. Tipping is not required but we did anyway. Javier brought us drinks with or without gratuities. It doesnt take much to really help them out with some tips. If you feel your drinks are too weak or you need more the staff will take care of you. The food was great too! I couldn't believe it after I read the reviews but I enjoyed everything. The food bar by the pool has some standard pizza slices that remind you of cafeteria style food. Just have them make you something different if your picky. The buffet in the main dining area had a different theme every night and a great breakfast layout every morning. The restaurants upstairs again were excellent. Our shower was the only negetive thing about our stay. It was pretty much for lathering up and a quick rinse. It drained slowly and that was a pain.

Right on the beach, great views and was well laid out. The rooms were pretty nice. As our stay unfolded, some issues arose and I decided to start keeping notes so I would not forget things. Not exactly what I wanted to do on a vacation. So...here it goes. Upon our arrival at the resort and just after check in, we were hit up by a \"time share\" employee for the Grand Hacienda which is another resort just north of Coco Bay. This was in addition to being hit up at the airport. Watch out for those folks, they will start out the conversation with small talk and then hit you up to have breakfast or lunch with them, etc. etc. It ended up our travel to Coco Bay was over 15 hours because of cancelled flights, etc. and all my wife and I wanted to do was get to the room and then go to the hot tubs to soak. To my horror, I learned the hot tub was closed at dark!! In addition to that, the water was luke warm. I couldn't even sit in it. I questioned this at the front desk and was told it is closed at dark every day for cleaning. Dumb. No one was out there cleaning anything until morning so I just dealt with it. The next morning we headed straight to the beach. I immediately noticed the swimming area was roped off and was pretty small considering there was a huge Sea out there. It was also surrounded with all kinds of boats. No where else on the beach could I see boats anchored, just here. Most likely because of a small break wall further out, but just our luck. So I decided to get some of the \"free\" snorkel equipment they offered. The trick was I could only use it in the swimming area for \"practice\" and it would cost me $30 for 15 minutes out on a boat where the nice stuff to see was. Tricked again. I then decided to ask how much the waverunners were and was told $60 for a half hour!! Bring extra cash folks. The next day we were going to Ex-Caret to swim with some dolphins. We had to call the place to find out about the shuttle. Were told to be in the lobby at 7:50am to be picked up except no one and I mean no one, told us of the upcoming TIME CHANGE on April 1st, hence we missed the shuttle. Then I asked the front esk if they could call the place again for us and they said I had to use \"another\" phone on the wall so the call could be billed to my room. I then became a bit upset I had to pay for a local call at an \"All-Inclusive\" resort and the front desk hispanic girls laughed at me!! We then had to pay $24 more dollars to get us to the place and back for taxi rides. We were also charged $21 for the use of the safety deposit box in the room. This box malfunctioned on us twice where maintenance had to be called to fix it. I asked for a refund and was never given one. Manager was not on site the first time I asked to speak to them and never got a hold of me after that. Nice. Lets move on to the alcohol and food. As an all-inclusive, I expected some good stuff. Not so. The alcohol was not as it seemed. No matter how much I drank, I could not feel it. My wife either nor other folks I talked to. The hard stuff had to be watered down, I just can't explain it. The mixed drinks were VERY sweet even if I asked for a double. Beer was most likely 3.2%. My advise is to stick to wine or do shots (and taste it for yourself) then go to town and buy a bottle of good stuff. I was definatley disappointed in that respect as I had paid for an all-inclusive. If you did not make \"reservations\" for the \"better\" restaurant on the first morning of your arrival for every night of the week, you were limited to the buffet area. The food there was not 1st class but it was not 3rd either. Somewhere in the middle and after six days it was starting to all taste the same. We did eat one time in the nice place above the buffet and it was good. But again, hard to get into. Not what I expected. Now this next part may gross you out and I did not see it, but my wife and daughter did. Bring your camera everywhere with you is my tip. On one breakfast we sat down to, my daughter had a small type of worm crawling out of her pineapple juice glass. Now this could have actually been from the fruit itself as it was very fresh and possibly made on site. This could be fairly normal as well, I just don't know but had to mention it. After I returned with my food, I was told about it. I then learned she had got it out of the glass with her finger, threw it on the floor and stepped on it. Man, would a video camera have been gold at that time!! The place also advertises a kids club and disco. The kids club was at best lame. My 9 year old daughter lasted about five minutes and wanted to leave. She ended up being with us the whole week!! Not something we expected either. Not sure what activites they had going, but I never say organized groups of kids doing things together which only added to my belief it was not a good program. The staff had a ping-pong table out there with paddles that looked 20 years old with ripped up rubber. The disco was no such thing. Kind of a small sports bar with one pool table and a bunch of TV's, again with those low alcohol drinks. Once you were outside of the place, the city looked very dirty. Not much clean-up after the last hurricane (I hope) but the shopping down 5th avenue was OK. We had lunch at a restaurant and spent the equivalent of $40 dollars!! for the three of us. Pricey. The vendors are very pushy so beware and stick to your guns. The room beds are fairly hard which some of you may like. TV is very limited and most channels are in spanish. I unrolled the toilet paper \"design\" that house keeping had made for us and an inch and a half cockroach came flying out. Kinda freaked me out a bit. The A/C worked good. Overall, the place is rated a 3-star and it is just that. If you just want to sit in the sun and enjoy the scene you can do that here. The pool is only 4' deep so be ready for that.

This trip was the first time we brought our kids (ages 6 & 8), so we were a little aprehensive about going to a large resort again. We decided on Grand Coco Bay after looking at travel brochures and reading this web sites reveiws. For the most part every thing was pretty accurate. Beach - The beach was very nice, it was protected by a sunken reaf about 100 yards off shore. So the waves wern't real large. But because of this there are boats anchored off shore in front of the resort. There is very little traffic on the beach, because there isn't a resort on either side of this one. There wasn't any vendors peddling there stuff. Pool - The pool was nice also, 4' max. depth ( great for kids), but not a ton of people in it all the time like larger resorts. The hot tubs were nice for the veiw of the beach, but not hot. Buffet - The buffet was average for what we've experienced at other resorts, food was good with a nice variety. Wait / bar staff - The staff was very courteous, but at times seemed a little under staffed. The wait was never very long but some times a little annoying. Entertainment - The entertainment staff was Very Very Good . There was something always going on, volley ball (beach / water) exercise, dancing, ping pong, bingo ( bingo for the gringo is what they called it - funny). Shows every night with a differant theme. Kids club for the kids. Our kids had a blast, the staff was great with them. Rooms - The rooms were a little nicer than others we stayed at. They were clean, we always had fresh towels.

The entertainment was very amateur, but they did their best; \"slap stick\" humor was not appropriate for kids at times. They did have a Mayan show (hired in) one evening and they were very good.

We booked GCB for 6 days, 5 nights, Feb 22nd thru 27th. We arrived at 11am on the 22nd and were told there were \"pipe problems\" and that they were all booked up, so we would have to spend the first 3 nights of our 5 night stay at the Viva Maya, which was about 10 minutes away. We later found out that their were no pipe problems, but instead, they were booked solid due to a weekend wedding, hence why we had to stay Thursay, Friday, and Saturday night at a different resort. We tried to argue, but Alfonso, the manager, told us we didn't have a choice. He then gave us a voucher for a free three night stay at GCB valid for one year. Thanks alot, like I really want to come back here. We picked GCB b/c it looked like a small, quiet, nice resort where we could relax and enjoy some peaceful time on the beach. Instead we were shipped to the lower quality Viva Maya (Viva Maya is 3 stars, GCB is 3.5 stars) and it was NOT what we wanted/expected. Viva Maya had NO beach (I guess the hurricanes and strong waters washed most of it away), and it was SOOO overcrowded, you had to be down to the pool by 7am to get a chair. It was totally obnoxious. There were so many people and so many kids and so much loud music by the pool We hoped for a quite relaxing vacation, and we were so ticked that for three of our five day vacation we had to stay at a loud, obnoxious, lower quality, hotel. We finally made it over GCB on our 4th day of vacation and it was still a debacle. They picked us up at noon and we arrived at GCB at 12:30, only to find out that our rooms would not be ready until 2pm. Checkout there is 11am, they had PLENTY of time to clean a room and have it ready for us, given what we had been through already. But no, they told us sorry and to go have lunch and come back in an hour. I was SO livid. Not only did we have to pack up all our stuff at 11am and take a 1/2 hr ride over to GCB, by the time we got there, the room wasn't even ready. We wasted nearly 3 hours in the middle of our day packing, unpacking, waiting for rooms and transportation. Ugh, what a disaster. Finally, when we got to GCB it was a total disappointment. Buffet food was very repetitive and not very good (and I'm not a picky eater, I have been to four all inclusive resorts in the last year and this was by far the WORST in terms of the buffet). The hotel is old and run down, the rooms are plain, not well kept/maintained. The only saving grace was the beautiful beach. The beach and thatch cabanas were really nice and relaxing.

So, anyways, off we went to Grand Co Co ( they did come to pick me up when they said they would). Perfect place to spend a week when all you want to do is walk from your room to the pool , to the bar , to the beach. Our view from our room was great, never a problem getting a chair at the pool or the beach. You can walk to downtown Playa in 15 min. no problem. Rooms were very clean and decent. We stayed here knowing we would go downtown and eat every night, which is exactly what we did and had excellent food (5th ave. is the best) Try Playasia, Blue Lobster, Babe's Noodle Bar, Xache, La Parilla, and so many more, just can't go wrong going downtown. Overall, I would go back to Grand Co Co, but beware, because of people there from N. Dakota that got bumped as well because of the same reason and 1/2 their trip was ruined, so I'm sure they are mad as he##. So be careful of this whole time share thing even though once you get past that I would stay there again in a heart beat because their beach was fantastic (- the boats) you just have to walk a few feet and it's all good. So, all and all I would recommend Co Co, just be careful and don\"t plan on eating there the whole time your in Playa (GO TO 5TH. Ave ) and go to Xel-Ha - fun!! If you like to snorkel.

We negotiated our case to no avail, we were being sent down the road so to speak. We were sent to a all inclusive resort with no beach, RIU Lupita. Very nice hotel, 4 star minimum with all the normal amenities. However, NO BEACH on site. BUT, Before Alfonso put us to the curb, he did the following: 1. Gave us coupon for 5D/4N free trip for one year, no air. 2. Set us up at a very nice resort, with transportation to and from at our convienence. 3. Ensured that we were badged to use any/all amenities at GCB during our stay. Effectively, we used the best of both resorts at our leisure. Our opinion of the GCB is that it is a well maintained 20 year old hotel. It is not NEW, it is clean and staffed properly. We did not view/use any rooms at the hotel as we were not \"guests\". We slept at the RIU Lupita and when we felt like it we made our way to the GCB. We took a free 3 minute bus ride to the \"5th Avenue\", took a leisurely 30 minute walk to GCB where we did the following. Sat on the beatiful, basically uncrowded beach. Used the spotless, but cold, (our weather was a little cool) HUGE beatiful pool. Refilled our thermal mugs at the pool bar, or the other two bars, if you cant wait until 11 am. Ate late breakfasts or early lunch or snacks at the buffet restaraunt or the snack bar. Used the poolside bathrooms without fear, they were cleaned regularly. My wife indicated one of the four toilets did not work. Maybe this will be fixed when you get there. My wife said that GCB quite likely had the best soup she has ever had. If the Pico de Gallo was a little spicier, I would give it 6 stars. We have traveled extensively in Mexico primarily due to my job.

This is a nice place to relax and as advertised, close to Playa. At the time of our visit the hotel was at 86% capacity. ROOM: Our room was on the 4th floor north side and was great! Some reviews complained of room odour, shower pressure, cold/hot water. We found none of this to be an issue. There were no bugs other than a stray mosquito here and there. Thats to be expected after all this is a tropical area. On arrival the room safe did not work. Hotel service staff attended promptly and replaced the entire unit without fuss. Our maid service was prompt and always kept the room very clean. FOOD: Each night there is a food theme, such as Italian, Mexican etc.. I found the food to be quite good, although the selection was somewhat limited some nights. Still though, how much food can one eat? The food was cooked properly and I did not feel sick at all during the stay. POOL: Having stayed at other resorts on the Mayan, I quite liked the pool set up here. It is acurately represented in photo's and spands most of the hotel. There is plenty of room to swim around and there was always a poolside chair available. Hotel staff were constantly cleaning the pool. BEACH: Again having stayed at other Mayan resorts this was an area i was least impressed with and is where Grand Coco receives my avg. rating. I felt cramped at the beach, and the boats anchored just off shore added to the cramped feeling. There were plenty of chairs available, but the beach is neither long nor wide. This is partly due to the past hurricane which took away some. I spent the majority of time around the pool which was fine, as the sun shines there too. BARS: The proximity of these to the pool and beach was nice. The staff working the bars were all pleasant and accomodating. I watched others complain about the wait for a beverage, but i suppose to each his own. The longest wait I encountered for a drink was 5 minutes. Is this too long? SYNOPSIS: This is an average resort but well worth the price. It is small with only 200 rooms. I found that 5 days was perfect. I found the close proximity to 5th Ave in Playa to be an added feature. I felt safe, and the staff working there were very professional and courteous at all times. I found it disappointing to hear people complain about wait times for drinks and food at the snack bar. I have waited far longer at home for drinks at a restaurant, bar, or even a drive thru fast food place. Thats only my opinion. The staff worked very hard to ensure guests were satisfied and I was.

If you are looking to be waited on hand and foot, again probably not the place for you (I would think that the pricing would be indicative of that). However, if you are looking for a reasonably priced, laid back place to spend some relaxing time, this is the place for you. The beach was nice to lay out on. If you walk south on the beach, you'll make it to a nice area with more waves to play in. Definitely head into town and walk around and shop...there are lots of greats things to see. It's about a $2 cab ride, so just head out the front door and ask them to take you in. The food at the hotel isn't the best, but again...what do you expect for the price? We would usually eat breakfast at the buffet, lunch at the pool (the guacamole and quesadillas were great!), and splurge a little and eat dinner in town. The bar crew will make a drink for you and serve it in your own cup. We had brought some coolie cups which worked swimmingly! You'll make less trips to the bar, and your drinks will stay colder. Tips aren't required, but if you do throw a buck or two here or there, you'll be amazed at how your drinks seem to have a little more zing to them! I recommend bringing a good amount of ones $, just to have to tip here and there. I found the rooms to be comfortable and we ended up with a good sized deck that we could go outside and hang out on. Again, this is Mexico, and 5-star isn't to be expected at a bargain price. Anyone who isn't too picky and who can live with out the frills will enjoy this resort and the beauty of Playa del Carmen that surrounds them. I love the Riviera Maya, and would highly recommend a trip to Playa over Cancun (unless your into huge crowds and clubbing until 4am). Playa is a little more refined and laid back.

The beer is Corona, maybe not the absolute finest, but a good quality Mexican beer. The bartenders are not paying for the booze, they want to please you, give them a tip now and then, they will make your drink any way you want it. No problem at all! And now for the GOOD, the BAD, and the UGLY. THE GOOD, I thought the food was terrific for a place this size and price. The buffet was varied from day to day. There was always something at each meal we were raving about. There were 2 different soups at lunch and dinner, one broth type, the other a cream soup that were just fantastic. Try them, no matter what the names, cactus soup, cr\u00e8me of lime, etc. We went to both of the ala-carte restaurants once. They were both pleasant dining experiences. Do not expect a steak like you would get at an expensive steak house in the U.S. This is Mexico, they are not known for beef. The snack bar at the pool has a large selection of fast food that will definitely satisfy those \u201cbetween meal hungries\u201d The beach is beautiful, with hard sand by the high water line for effortless walking with very few beach venders but contains a few casual bars and restaurants along the way. The rooms were kept clean. The staff was pleasant. I\u2019m mostly a beer drinker, but I was surprised at the quality of the booze, definitely \u201ctop shelf\u201d liquor. The Lobby Bar opens at 6PM and provided a nice friendly atmosphere for a few adult beverages in the evening. We took the taxi to town ($3). Playa del Carmen is one of the nicest tourist towns I\u2019ve ever been to. A large and varied assortment of goods, not the same massed produced junk one finds in Cancun. It also looked like it would be a fun place to spend an evening (maybe next time). The ferry to Cozumel costs $10 one-way and is an enjoyable trip. Only buy a one-way ticket as there are 2 competing ferries and they alternate hourly, so you may be riding the competitor on the way home. The ferry drops you right where the cruise ships dock in Cozumel so there is loads of shopping and dining without needing transportation. Even with 3 big cruise ships in port the prices seemed reasonable and the crowds, manageable. Definitely a worthwhile side trip. THE BAD I want to preface this comment by saying that I tip well. The bartenders, while extremely competent in what they did, never went out of their way to be friendly or to make those wild colorful drinks found at other resorts. When I asked a bartender to make 4 \u201cMexican flags\u201d, he stated he only had one shot glass that was the right size and he needed it for something else. The outdoor bar by the pool had no bar stools on the deck side and shut down around sunset. There was a Sports Bar/Disco above the buffet that didn\u2019t attract many customers. It had 5 or 6 TVs tuned to European basketball or Soccer with out sound. The sound was a type of very loud \u201cTechno-Rap\u201d that drove most patrons away after one drink. In other words, there was no place you could get a drink out-doors in the evening. I agree with the comments about the showers, they were downright scary. The water would fluctuate from hot to cold and back again with no notice. THE UGLY The three sets of public bathrooms off the bars and pool areas all needed the immediate attention of a plumber. They were filled with a strong sewer smell, the urinals were over-flowing and the men\u2019s room toilet in the Disco Bar lacked a toilet seat. I don\u2019t know if the heavy rains had anything to do with this condition, but they existed from the day we arrived through the day we left. I cannot imagine anyone in business not rectifying a condition like this, and I hope it\u2019s fixed when/if you decide to go. Would I go back? I think that with better weather and a little TLC from the local plumber this would be a very enjoyable place to spend a vacation.

The hotel was very clean. The room was standard but when you look into the hotel it states that from the beginning. Never was really in the room that long anyway. The main thing was that it was clean and we always had fresh towels. Check in was pretty smooth. The staff was super friendly from the front desk, to the bartendars, the waiters and the entertainment crew! I got locked out of the bathroom (5am) and messed up the combination to the safe but both times a staff member came immediately and took care of the problem. The food was good with a different variety every day at the buffet. You have to know going in to a different country that the food will be a little different than you are used to. If you go in with that attitude you won't be disappointed. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night. The dinner was good. It was nice to have the snack bar by the pool all day. Food there was not bad. I wouldn't suggest eating the hamburger or hot dog (deep fried) if you are expecting it to be like the ones you get in the US. There was always food available to you and always a bar open. The pool was huge. They always had activities going on by the pool (aerobics, water ones, volleyball in pool and on beach, ping pong, darts, dancing etc.) It was nice to sit in the pool bar. The week we were there it was VERY windy so it was a little cool being in the pool. The wind also made the ocean VERY rough. Guess we just caught a bad week. The ocean water was nice though. There are boats docked right in front of you on the beach. Once again, if you know this going in then it won't be a problem. We just walked down the beach a little and went swimming in the ocean there. The beach and water are beautiful. Left the hotel one day because it wasn't nice out. Took a taxi $3 to the shopping area on 5th Avenue. It was nice to walk around to all the stores and there were also places to eat. We booked out trip through Expedia and dealt with Ricardo. He was very friendly and helpful. He was at the hotel every day and if we wanted to do anything we did it through him. I read timeshare people were there bothering you but not one of them (at the hotel) ever approached us. We did get grabbed 1st thing at the airport though! Overall we had a very nice time. It is definitely well worth the money you pay. You eat and drink all day and there is always something going on.

Only the pool bar used real bannana in daquiris and these were served only in plastic glasses that always tasted of soap.

Chicken was ok early in the day as they cook it in the morning, later in the day it was dry and tough. French fries, if you insisted on fresh cooked were ok.

The kicker for us was that we paid alot of money for what we got. The water quit running in the middle of showering. The bar was below us and was very loud until midnight or sometimes later. The food was not good. There was NEVER any snorkel gear-and we checked several times throughout the day. The boats in front of the hotel obstruct the view. And the smell of gasoline from the jet skiis and boats was very evident. I would not stay here again. I would advise others to find a different hotel/resort in Playa. Also, we thought Excaret was a total waste of money. I have heard others rave about it. Excaret was crowded-maybe because we went during Christmas Break. It was PACKED! The map was in spanish and very difficult to read. We spent most of our day wondering around lost and very hot. Towards the end of our day, we finally found a pool-one filled with sea water-and cooled off. Later we made it to the beach-which was wall-to-wall people. Not very inviting. The day was a total disappointment after spending $170 to get in! The snorkeling was pretty dull and the food was expensive. We spent our day waiting in line.

Our stay began at about 9:00PM on Sunday. We were greeted by the belboy Jose, who was wonderful. He showed us around from the lobby and pointed out the different restauraunts and bars. The first room that we were in was on the 3rd floor and it was a little difficult for our handicapped daughter to get down to the pool/beach area but after speaking to someone at the front desk we had no problem changing rooms to one on the first floor. The pool and beach were just wonderful. The weather was great. You might get a small shower but it really didn't matter, if you were in the water or on the beach, everything dried off in no time and the fun just continued. Most of that fun was due to the great entertainment staff. This group of young men and women is what actually makes this hotel so GREAT. They are EXCEPTIONAL AT WHAT THEY DO. They had our entire family involved, it was even fun just to watch their antics during the water polo games, the beach volleyball and the dancing. The casino night and comedy show were spectacular. Our 11year old daughter especially enjoyed the dancing. Her favorite dance partner was Ulises, he made her feel so special. I would definitely recommend this hotel just for the entertainment staff. The drinks were always free flowing, granted it would have been nice to have an extra bar open, but the bartenders that are there do an excellent job of getting your drinks to you.

Room: Great view, but that was about all that was great. The bed was absurdly hard. I really considered whether the tile floor might be more comfortable. I prefer a firm bed, and at a hotel I'm willing to accept a lot, but this was way beyond the norm. Our shower frequently didn't work - the cold water shut off, scalding the hapless bather and leaving them with a trickle of very hot water. The air temperature was hard to control and never quite cool enough. One thing that irritated me was that at an \"all inclusive\" resort they wanted $3 / day for use of the safe. I understand that there are limits to \"all inclusive\", but to me a $3 / day safe charge is tacky. Other than that, the rooms were clean and the maid service was very thorough. Food: Undoubtedly this was the biggest disappointment. For breakfast and lunch you have the buffet, which is ok but never stellar. For dinner, you have the buffet again, or if you make a reservation you can eat at the Mexican or Italian restaurant. I highly recommend you stay AWAY from these restaurants. The food presentation is beautiful, and the chefs are clearly talented, but they're not given much to work with. All of the food tasted oddly unwholesome, as though none of it were fresh. In particular, the olives and mushrooms were clearly canned and incredibly nauseating. The red wine - which is on tap - was atrocious, overwhelmingly dominated by very unpleasant chocolate flavors. Everything we ate in either of these restaurants succeeded in making us feel ill, and we tried them both only once. The most irritating part was that we were there during Christmas, and on Christmas eve the staff saw fit to suspend the dinner buffet in favor of a \"special\" Christmas dinner held in a small conference room where we were forced to eat the disgusting restaurant fare, sharing cramped tables with other guests. They had only two or three waiters working this event, and we were unable to get water served to us before the end of the meal - nor did they have a table set up where we could serve ourselves. I was really ticked about this, more than anything on the entire trip. In addition to the buffet, there's a snack bar open most of the day. It was OK, although when we asked for the portobello sandwich (which is on the menu) they seemed never to have heard of it, and I got the impression that several of the items on the menu were not actually \"on the menu\". Even the drinks were questionable. Most of the mixed drinks tasted like the alcohol was watered down. I could have drank their Pi\u00f1a Coladas all day long and not suspected I'd had any alcohol at all. The cups they were served in gave the drinks an odd soapy taste. In addition, the quality of the drink varied wildly according to which bartender mixed it. Beach / Pool: The beach is beautiful, although there are a number of boats anchored that obstruct your view. There is coral very close that you can swim out to and explore with snorkel gear which is provided for free. Staff: Friendly and helpful - particularly the cleaning and front desk staff. Some other reviews point out the sales pitches they give you in the lobby, and these are indeed obnoxious. At a certain point it's like \"Ok, get a clue - we paid money to come here and vacation, not get a sales pitch\". That was over pretty quick though and wasn't much of a detraction - just tacky and annoying. Overall: If you're already booked, you can relax and go with the confidence that you'll have a good time. If you haven't already booked, look elsewhere and see if you can find one with more positive reviews.

The breakfasts in the buffet where a favorite of ours as well as great deserts for all of the meals. We only ate once in the Italian restaurant and the food was mixed, some of our group really liked it and others were not so impressed. The food by the pool was mixed, some was good and some was not so great. Overall I would give the food a B+. Room: The room was about normal size and the beds were firm, pillows are very flat. Room in my opinion could have been cleaner, with all of the humidity the walls had dust bunnies stuck to them. The tile floors where cleaned daily and overall everything else in the room was fine. I think they clean the same things every day and those things are very clean, while ceilings and walls should be cleaned a little more frequently. I would give the room a B. Pool and Beach: Lets just start with giving them an A+. The Pool is huge and has many different depths and ledges to hang out on. The bar in the pool was great to hang out at, and the kiddy pool is connected to the big pool which makes it great for people with little kids. The beach was great, plenty of chairs and beautiful blue water. The beach is sheltered by an offshore reef so there is very little surf, we walked down the beach to get more waves when we wanted to play in the surf. Location: Easy to get to everything, a taxi to downtown playa was only $3.50.

We actually lost track of time and what day it was, and it was not because of drinking too much. We did not care!! The one down side was when you left the property, you were almost assaulted by people trying to sell you something. That I did not like. Cozumel was fantastic. Heres a hint. Rent a cab for 4 hours and have them take you to the ruins and the other side of the island. Eat at Bob Marley's place, fresh grouper and conch was tremendous! The laid-back attitude is something we really miss . If you are looking for a small place to relax at and not a lot of activity, the Grand Coco Bay is definitly the place for you.

You can walk the secluded beach at night very romantic(enough said). 5 Take the Xel-ha (Shell ha)tour through the expedia counter inside the hotel great water experience. 6. Good cable tv CNN, DIscovery, 3 HBO's ESPN. 7. All the beer alcohol and mixed drinks you want (top shelf). Planning on going back. Go to town often to shop/hang out. 5th Avenue, that they modeled after NYC, many same shops. Go to Cozumel during the morning you access it at 5th avenue via ferry. Take Xelha/Tulum tour through expedia. CAREFUL of local food while in town. Dont drink tap H20, while in town or hotel will regret it. I'm still having problems 1 wk after returning.

I read the reviews on this site first, which was very helpful in making a decision. I was a little hesitant after reading about bed bugs and a few unsatisfied vacationers....but went with not very high expectations and was very pleased! We stayed from July 7th - 17th (it was a bit too long). We did not have any bed bugs, but the beds were very firm. We heard on the shuttle back to the airport that you could ask for bed pads that make them softer (oh well). Also, they only offer rooms with one king bed or two double beds (no queens available at all). This may not be best for families like ours sharing a room! The main thing for me was to have fast, easy access to the beach & pool etc. within a minute or two from our room (with kids you are ultimately forgetting something or needing to go back to your room) and this resort was perfect! The big hotels are fancier, but you are just a number and it seems like everything takes longer to get to. This resort had a very laid-back, fun, family atmosphere. We made friends with the Fabulous \"Fabien\" out at the pool, we tipped him at the end of the first day and every day thereafter, and he brought us drinks whenever we wanted, where ever we were, he found us! He is fabulous, a hard worker, and after 10 days...a dear friend! The rest of the staff was also very friendly and helpful also. The food was great, they have theme nights - Italian, Mexican, Japanese, Carribian, etc. Always found something I really liked. The snack bar food at the pool was excellent, but I am BIG on fresh guacamole and salsa (pico) and warm tortilla chips....they do have other great stuff too! We weren't impressed with the upstairs restaraunt that you had to make reservations for, but then that wasn't the vacation we were after anyway! They do run short on towels in your room, but if you ask they bring more. We had no agenda (unlike our cruise last year), played at the pool, at the beach, my husband played beach volleyball & worked out in the gym. We brought rafts & goggles which were great in the pool and out in the ocean, brought insulated mugs which were also great and met alot of nice people and families. The town (shopping, bars etc.) is a nice 15 min. walk down the breathtakingly beautiful beach (can't seem to get those pictures to download, but take my word, it's spectacular). We did this a couple of times and it was awesome! We went to Xcaret on a very HOT day and wanted to go back at first, but the kids went to swim with the dolphins (very neat!) and after we went upstairs to this outdoor restaraunt right above it with palapas that overlooked the ocean on one side and the beaches and dolphins on the other....what a beautiful day! Overall this was a wonderful vacation for a very reasonable price! The things I would definitely change next time are: stay 7 days not 10; ask for the bed padding; take more pictures!!!

I have been a travel agent 14 yrs and have been to numerous beaches but this one is by far is one of the best. It was much better than Cancun where all water sports are in the murky lagoon. I loved that there are no other hotels close by. The scenery on the way to the hotel leaves much to be desired. But it reminds me of poor areas I've seen in other tropical destinations. The hotel was what I expected. It was a good value. You can't expect a 5 star (like Marriott, Hilton and such) for this price. This hotel was the same price as other hotels without the meals. After reading the bad reviews of the meals, I figured if it's really that bad we'll eat in town. The food wasn't outstanding but decent. Just know you have to make reservations 7am-11am for the Mexican and Italian restaurant at the podium in the buffet restaurant. We had to figure this out cause the front desk staff doesn't volunteer much information. We learned more information from a book that was just laying by the front desk. The dancing at the evening shows were awesome. My husband and I I took our children ages 8, 14, 17. My teens didn't have much to do but my 8yr old enjoyed the kids club. It wasn't much but playing video games, boardgames, and they had a water balloon fight in the pool at 4:30p every day. My son really loved the kids disco upstairs by the restaurants. It's for kids until 10pm and they have music and beverage bar, dance floor, pool table and sports on several tv's. If your going for the whole beach experience this is definitely worth it.

(I typed this in a hurry so I apologize for typos) Here's some tips: (1)Take a bottle of water with you and have them fill it at the various beverage bars. We took a few 12 packs and put in the fridge. Take your own wash cloths. For some reason they are scarce at the resort. We had a total of 3 the entire 7 days we were there. We purchased white ones from Walmart and left them there when we left. So hopefully they will have at least a dozen more to add to inventory.(2)On the plane, make sure you fill out the customs forms BEFORE you depart the plane. Make sure the bottom is filled in as well. Doing this will save you time at the customs window. After you process through the window to get your temporary visas, you claim your baggage. They have carts for you to use. Beware...you can only use these for a few feet after the customs areas. Then you have to pay a porter to take your bags from the cart and to your travel representative area. Make sure that the people you deal with after customs have their airport badges. It is overwhelming when you exit customs.(3)Take a deep breath when riding in the transportation there, they drive erratically and we almost hit several cars at various times.(4)What they don't tell you when you rent a car...You are not completely covered even if you have the full coverage insurance. When you give them your card, they place a $2,000 hold on it to cover any damages. This takes 10 plus days to clear after you are done renting the car.(5)Be careful using your credit cards in Mexico...our information was stolen and various charges have been placed on our cards.(6) Don't use the phone service in the rooms. Although it says no service charge, a 3 minute phone call cost $64.28, and then they steal your card information and use it to add extra phone calls. Downstairs in the lobby there is a machine and phone that you can purchase phone cards from and can use the phone right beside it. Caution, a 10 minute card costs 100 pesos and they charge you when you inset your calling card pin eventhough you have not connected to your call yet.(7)Use the bus system if you want to travel into Cancun...it's realitively cheap. Taxis into town are also very cheap, but get more costly the further you go. Ask for the price before you get in...they can vary from driver to driver for the same location $1-$2. Average cost into town was $3 for four people.(7)They have a Walmart and a Sam's club in Playa Del Carmen, so if you need something you can get it there.(8)If you need a doctor, call the front desk. Our son got an ear infection and we needed medical services. The doctor comes to your room. He was amazing, great with children and he even calls in your prescriptions an they are delivered to the hotel. The cost for the visit is $60 before 10pm and then it goes to $80. The cost for the scrips were $46 and included an antibiotic, ear drops, and pain meds. If you purchased the travel guard insurance...a note to save you an expensive phone call...You have to file with your insurance first, then they pay what is left, so save a phone call and call when you get home for the claim form. You will recieve a receipt from the doctor and the pharmacy. The doctor will also issue you a letter if you have an excursion planned so you can re-schedule or get your money back.(9)Tipping isn't necessary, but it gets you a long way if you do. We tipped the front desk people, the bell boys, and in the (buffet)restaurant a few times, and housekeeping a few $ and received excellent service.(10)When you are told to go to 5th avenue for souvenirs, it's a great idea. Although we found the souvenirs cheapest at their playa mart store and another one similar in the middle of the avenue. We made the mistake and purchased from a smaller shop and found the same thing at the playa mart $7 cheaper.(11)Excursions, if you got to Xel-Ha(Shell-Ha) make sure you take biodegradable sun screen or exchange your at the kiosk after you enter for sample packets. You get your sunscreen back when you leave. We were not told that the koisk gave you free samples and paid $15 for their sunscreen at the gift shop. Also make sure when you book the Tulum & Xel-Ha tour you have the tour operator that takes you to the ruins first. We thought that is what we were supposed to do and found out otherwise. It was almost unbearable at the ruins in the afternoon in the heat. Also at Tulum you will have to purchase a $2 tram ride for each adult to get to the site or you have to walk 10 minutes to get there. It is a round trip ticket, so don't lose the other piece.(12) STAY AWAY FROM THE TIMESHARE PEOPLE. The warn you several times, but the $100 -$150 dollars thet offer you seems like it might be worth the 90 minute tour. It's not!!!! We went at 9:30 and didn't leave until 4:30. We even tried to tell them no several times and even after they found out we were RCI owners they still trie to sell you the property. It is not worth it to waste a day with them. Now about the resort: Don't be alarmed at the part of town you travel through to get to the resort, it will make you have your doubts, but the resort is beautiful. The beaches are kept clean. They rake them every morning and they had someone out picking up the seaweed and debri washed in by the ocean. They have plenty of chairs and umbrellas and we were always able to find shade or sun. The pool and grounds were kept clean eventhough several people constantly never cleaned up after themselves. The swim up bar and the other bars are great and you get unlimited beverages. The food was very good, I am a picky eater and I found something every meal that kept me full. We tried the Italian restaurant as well and were very impressed. Our chldren embarrassed us by not eating the food, so we kept to the buffet the rest of the time. The snack bar food is exceptional. The rooms are clean, but the beds are really firm. Housekeeping cleaned our room daily. There are ants, but not very many. Don't keep food in your room. We brought ant traps along because I have an ant phobia. Try to get a room with a view on the 3rd floor. We were upgraded to an amazing room with a view and loved it. The staff was never rude and the nightly shows are funny. they are however more geared toward adults and we didn't frequent them as much after the second show had drinking games and so sexual inuendos. We didn't use the kids club, but I talked with several parents who did and their children had a blast. You will never be bored and the view is amazing. Yes there are boats because it is a natural harbor. I think they added to the view and they are outside the designated swim area and never seemed to be a problem. What did bug me was the jet ski rental, which if offered as an extra activity at the resort. They zoom back and forth constantly in between the boats and the smell of gasoline was a bit overwhelming at times. The water is a beautiful blue and clear so you can see the bottom. There are friendly little fish that surprised my youngest. We had an amazing time and are ready to go back really soon. The resort is a smaller resort and it is more kid friendly. The beach is a private beach and the walk is hop skip and a jump. The staff were all amazing and the price we paid was well worht it! The locals get a kick out of you trying to learn and speak their language and are very helpful if you don't know the right words. All in all our family gave it a big 4 thimbs up.

The Italian restaurant was very good. We ate there twice. You have to book ala cartes between 7am and 11am. They won't take reservations after that. The snack bar is terrific. They had burgers, fries, nachos,quesedillas,roasted chicken and pizza as well as sandwiches. We ate lunch there most days. Bring an insulated mug for the drinks to keep them cold. They will fill any size mug that you bring. We had e-mailed the resort to request a room with a view and a king size bed and they graciously honoured our request. You could safely walk into town and go shopping or out to bars and restaurants. There was lots of activity going on in town.Beware of the timeshare people both in town and at the resort. We took a taxi a few times and it only cost us $4 US for the 4 of us. The ferry to Cozumel was interesting and there is lots to do there. Only one negative thing to say and that is we asked for a wake-up call on our departure day (5:30 am) and neither one of our rooms got one. Take an alarm clock because there are no clocks in the room. Also only pop is put in the mini fridge. Bring a bottle of water and then just keep refilling it at the buffet. Water dispensers are available there. A good time was had by all. We would go back to this area again but will try a different resort next time only because we like to try different places each time we travel.", "Date": "July 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "cypress,tx", "Title": "\u201cGREAT TIME, OK HOTEL 6-16 TO 6-19 Houston, texas\u201d", "Author": "dawnlynnore", "ReviewID": "UR5490476", "Content": "This was our first time in Playa, It is a very pretty place, we found the people were very nice and kind .

The beds on the other-hand are very hard, but after a day at the beach or a walk into town your body really won't mind. The food is alright. The Beach is by far the best. I walked to the first Pier which is 5th ave. and the second Pier which is the fairy dock. I didn't find any part of the beach that could even compare to Grand Coco Bay Beach. So if your going to Playa for the food I would suggest going to another resort. But, if you want a beautiful beach and a nice clean resort, than this is the place. I have been to Cancun three times and Playa once. ( I will always go to playa del carmen.) Best part of our trip was playing beach volley ball and water volley ball. The entertainment staff (Ricardo, Isidro, Dustin and all the other guys) did a great job everyday motivating all of us. My kids daily played game and even exercised.

We were there for seven nights and I wish we could have stayed somewhere else. I guess you get what you pay for on cheap vacation. We checked in on June 29th and after three rooms we finally had one that was okay. The first room did not have air, the second room did not lock, the third room was a handicap room. We decided to stay in the third one b.c we were so sick of moving around. If you get stuck in that room, get ready to have water all over the bathroom floor. The shower sprays everywhere. The first two days we hungout at the pool and I did have a great time doing that. Lots of fun activities for one to have fun. There are LOTS of children so if you want to be around kids while you are drinking and trying to have fun then this is the place for you. It really wasn't what I wanted but then again we chose this hotel because of the price. As for the food....YUCK! We lasted three nights eating there and finally I said...NO MORE. It is very bland with no spice. Not exactaly what you want when you are in mexico. I think they have the food that way because of the tourists. I understand that, I guess. I ended up only eating breakfast at the resort and at night we went into town for dinner. I am not saying that you may not like it but for me I need a little more spice. As for the drinks at the resort....No problems there. I would tip the guys a little and then the drinks would come out the way I like them. After awhile the corona draft was getting old. That is the only beer that you have at the resort and draft beer after awhile gets gross. But, it did not stop me from drinking it!!!!! Grand Coco Bay is what it is. Remember you are getting what you pay for. As for Playa del Carmen......I love it!!!!!!! WE are already looking into going back in December! Oh...one more thing. We did not do the tours that resort offerend b.c we did not want to be on a time schedule. One day we went to Cozumel and did an awesome Catamaran snorkle trip. It is called the Fury.....AWESOME!!!!!!!! One day we rented a jeep and cruised around. WE went to Xcaret on our own. As for Xcaret.....Never again. I felt like I was at Disney World in Mexico.

But the hotel does have a bar open late upstairs that was very fun to hang out at!! We ate at all of the restaurants the hotel offered and loved them all. You do need to make reservations early for the mexican and Italian places and don't forget to dress up or they will make you change...The pool was huge and there was always open chairs to lay out in. There are also always chairs available at the beach. There are boats out front but that didn't bother us at all. You can walk 100ft in either direction to get away from them if you really wanted. The hotel staff was very friendly (even more so when you tip extra), and there was always something going on..from pool volleyball to water balloon fights. The rooms were alway cleaned and all the balconys have great views. While we were there we took ATV tours through the jungle to the cenotes which was excellent! If you want more of an adventure dont go through funjet- go into town and find people who give tours..they are better! Also, the best bar to hang out at was the Blue Parrot.

All the kids had a great time and I liked the fact it was a small hotel because we could look out our balcony or from our table and see the kids with no problem. The beach right in front of the hotel did have the boats but it was neat to see. Especailly did not bother us since we checked out the boogie boards and went right up the left side of the beach to a perfect area to body surf and boogie board. Stayed a week right after school was out and only a few people on the beach around the hotel compared to all the people we saw when we walked to town via the beach in front of all the other grand hotels. We had a room right above the lobby and I would not recommend that. Although we had a clear straight on view of the pool and beach it was very loud at night. Our room was kept very clean and the service was great. A/C in the room worked awsome. Yes the beds are a little hard but I slept pretty good. Never a problem getting a chair or umbrella at the pool. The entertainment guys were great and they worked such long hours but obviously love what they are doing. Again they kept an eye out for the kids which made us feel totally safe to go to dinner without the kids. The nightly entertaiment was actually good if you appreciate talented dancers, which I do so I loved it. Out of the 8 of us traveling together I liked the buffet the least. It was good but I kind of got sick of it. The fruit was awsome and at the Snack Shack the chicken and the nachos were the best. Not to mention the lemon ice cream which was my favorite. As far as drinks just ask for \"mucho\" of whatever alcohol and you get plenty. yes I tipped the staff when I had it on me but that did not seem to matter they always did a great job.

I took my husband here on a suprise trip for his 40th birthday. Neither of us had been to Mexico before--so we weren't sure exactly what to expect--it is a poor country and you do see that as you arrive to the hotel--however, once you are at the hotel it seems as if that part of town is miles away. We always felt very safe at the hotel--they have security present at all times and the Mexicans overall are all very gracious to the tourists. We had heard they got a new chef the week we were there (a couple that had been there for 2 weeks gave us that info) and the food had improved dramatically. We never had a problem with the buffets-there was always a good selection. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night and it too was good. It was very nice having food available poolside all day long. As far as drinks go -- we brought our own insulated mugs -- yes, they will fill them up for you. We were envied by many other guests who had to use the small plastic hotel cups. Try the Miami Vice drink-mmmm good. We loved the swim up bar. They even have top shelf liquor. You must try the Mexican coffee too-they served it during the Mexican buffet. The hotel is kept very clean and it is very pretty. Yes, the beds are firm--but not bad. The hotel staff overall is extremely friendly and will allow you to be as involved in activities as you would like. It seemed like an excellent place to bring your kids-they all looked like they were having a blast. We were there just to relax and soak up the sun--and that's exactly what we did! There were tons of lounge chairs in both sun and shade--poolside or beach. They will provide you with very large beach towels. The staff also speaks very good english as well as many other languages. There were many Italians there during our stay. The beach is absolutely beautiful. I felt we had a much more private beach than other hotels closer to Playa. There is a lot of foot traffic in front of their hotel beach areas. Since Grand Coco Bay is at the end of the hotel chain there are not many people going by you when laying at the beach. It is a very nice walk into Playa via the beach--we did it once or twice a day. We actually enjoyed having the boats in front of our hotel - it was a pretty view and with the reef there are not as many harsh waves coming up to shore as other parts of the beach down to playa. I would recommend wearing beachshoes (especially for the kids) when in the water as there are many broken pieces of shells/coral underfoot. We took taxis many times--we never had a problem. Taxi drivers are fun to talk to. A trip into Playa is $3.00--from Xcaret-$10.00--and the airport-$40.00. FYI: there is a 24 hour pharmacy in Playa and you can get drugs there that we can only get with a prescription! Take in some snorkeling somewhere there--we did it at Excaret with their special tour--very cool!! We also went out fishing and each caught a Barracuda!!

We had booked our hotel and paid for it ahead of time. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with our stay. I can't really say it was one glaring thing, but instead more of a group of things. Yes, the food was not great on the buffet. Yes, the drinks were not very strong and the beer and wine was only offered on tap (wine on tap?). I could have dealt with any of these things if it had not been for the customer service. That is what the Grand Coco Bay lacked...customer service. I know a lot of people here rave about the entertainment people. Yes, they seemed great. We did not really engage with them, as we were there to enjoy Mexico and all that Playa del carmen has to offer...not do step aerobics to loud music poolside. However, the people that did seemed to have a great time. I'm talking about the customer service you get from the front desk and from people you come in contact with regardless of what you do at the resort. When we first arrived at the hotel, it was 10:30 at night. The gentleman behind the desk told us that they only had one room left that was oceanfront, so it would be an extra $25 a night. We told him that we had already paid for our room and would not be paying extra. He tried to bargain it down to an extra $20 a night, and when we still said no, he said he would give us the room for free that night, but that we would have to move the next day. I have never stayed in a hotel where you have to move rooms because they gave away all the other rooms, but whatever. Well, the next day we got back from downtown Playa (which was GREAT) and found out that our room had been moved because our keycards had been deactivated and we could not get into our room to get our stuff. They did move us into another room that actually worked out better because it did not smell nearly as bad as the other. Anyway, our friends had to force the issue as well on getting a room that they had already paid for...they had them in a lower cost room and were refusing to move them for two days! Then we tried to go to dinner that night at the Italian restaurant. No one tells you how to make reservations, so we called the front desk that morning. They said they could get us in at 6:30 and we were all set. Well, when we showed up at 6:30, they did not have us down and refused to seat us. We did finally get into the Mexican restaurant the next night and it was really good. There were a host of other things that happened, like going on a snorkel trip offered by the hotel that took us out in the ocean where the wind was blowing so hard that the water was whitecapping and it was so dangerous that they had to rescue one guy who was so exhausted he could not swim anymore...no one cared. The kicker to me, though, had to do with water. The Grand Coco Bay actually RAN OUT of bottled water on Saturday morning and said they would not have anymore until Monday. RAN OUT of bottled water...in MEXICO!!! To me, that is a health hazard! Again, no one cared. I have never done one of these reviews before, but really felt strongly about letting people know that you may have a great stay if you go here, but if you have ANY issues at all, they will not be addressed.

We walked once along the beach to Playa - a nice walk with not much effort. The other times we took the Taxi for 3$. We also went to Tulum and spent another day on a snorkeling trip.

Both Tulum and snorkeling were incredible and we recommend you go. Next time we will rent a car or investigate 'collectivos'. During our snorkeling we saw a sting ray, an eel, a lobster, and many fish big and small. Back to the resort... the air conditioning was ice cold, the little ants I have read about were microscopic. No bother to us at all. Snorkeling off the beach at the resort does not offer much. We used the gear from the hotel and they discouraged us from snorkeling outside the swim ropes. They were concerned about the wave runners and boats parked outside the swim zone. We kayaked first to see if there was a reef area (not). Then we snorkeled out a little ways outside the swim ropes. Really not much to see. If you want to go snorkeling and see fish you probably have to go to a snorkeling destination in the area. We had been warned by people - don't drink the water... so we didn't. But the last night we were there we did have ice in our drinks with no problem whatsoever.

The hotel was only half full. The reception staff pleasantly honored our request to be moved to a room with a direct view of the beach. The room, although small and non-descript, was VERY clean. Everything was in working order. There were only 3 draws in the dresser but the closet was large with several shelves. The balcony has two plastic chairs and a small table. Our room was cleaned by 9:30 every day. We did not partake of the on site entertainment, but it looked like folks were having fun with the entertainment staff. They did beach yoga, volleyball, bingo, aerobics, dance lessons, etc. The resort is absolutely beautiful. The grounds are immaculate. The view upon entering the hotel is breathtaking. There are more than enough lounge chairs on the beach, we were able to get chairs in the shade everyday and didn't have to get there early in the morning. The staff was efficient and we could always find a waiter to bring us drinks on the beach. The pool bar was great for hangng out. The pool was also very clean. Use sunscreen and lots of it. There is a cool breeze coming off the water so you might not notice how strong the sun is. We both have nice sunburns to attest to how strong the mexican sun can be. Bring thermal cups for your drinks - they keep things colder longer, won't spill and the staff is only too happy to fill your thermal cup with whatever you like. All of the water served at the bars and restaurants is filtered so it is ok to drink. No problem with the ice cubes. Getting a taxi into Playa del Carmen is easy and very inexpensive. I highly recommend Iza Spa. The facilitites were magnificent and the staff very professional. They have a website (-). I bought Spa Finder gift certificates at Costco which they happliy accepted.(I paid $80 for $100 worth of certificates - great buy). We called before leaving the states and made a reservation for massage and facial. The roof top lounge area was very nice. After the spa we had a late lunch at Sur which is a restaurant directly across the street from the spa. Excellent food.. I had the sesame crusted mahi and my friend had the grilled salmon. Both dishes were a 10 out of 10 on quality, taste and presentation. We went back a few days later for dinner and were blown away by their grilled lobster. The best lobster dinner I have ever had in my whole life. After visiting the silver shops on 5th avenue which is a nice pedestrian street we headed to the Tequilla Barrel where we remained until after midnight. Even though the resort was all inclusive we were very happy to spend our pesos for a good meal and some tequilla shots - we recommend Tres Generaciones- very smooth. IF you are planning on buying any silver be prepared to bargain and know what things cost back in the states. Visit Taxo silvershops back home. I think you can get better prices here in the states than we got in Mexico. Still it was fun to browse the stores and buy a few pieces as a memento of our trip. Back to the resort. The beach was cleaned of seaweed each day. However they could have done a better job of cleaning the sand around the chairs, we saw some cigarette butts and trash, but not enough to spoil the experience. The food was yucky!. We both recommend the omelets for breakfast. We found the rest of the dishes bland. Do not order the \"steak\" in the mexican restaurant - it was so tough it was not edible. We didn't try the italian restaurant but did not hear good reviews from the other guests we spoke to. The snack bar is convenient. The wings and fries are good. We enjoyed the guacamole and salsa with chips. We got a great deal on airfare and the hotel from United Vacations. It was very well worth the price we paid. Aside from the food not being great everything else about this resort is a 10! I would recommend this hotel to anyone!

My husband wanted to snorkel and just went down the beach alittle ways. The resort is small compared to the bigger resorts further south but we sort of liked that. My only problem was with the first room they gave us which was near the service door to the theater area.

The jacuzzi was not open but they were painting it so I assume it will be open very soon. The food was OK...it is Mexico. We liked the mexican restaurant and not the italian, unlike other reviews. We did have a few little tiny ants in the bathroom but not a big deal. We enjoyed the entertainment including the shows and casino night. The staff works very hard. Always filling drinks, even on the beach and pool side. They are constantly cleaning, we were very impressed. The area around the hotel is under construction.

The fruit was great! The italian and mexican restaurants were good however they were very hot inside. The pool bar did not open until 11am and some times you would have to wait a while to get drinks. To get drinks before that you had to go to the buffet restarurant because they had a fully operating bar that opened at 7am. The staff was great. Everyday they would make us special drinks and any kind of food you would like even if it is not on the buffet. The maid had our room cleaned by 9am everyday and the entertainment staff had activities for everyone to participate in daily. It is a relatively quiet resort with not much going on after the 9pm show. A few people go the the sports bar and some people stay at the lobby bar. There are numerous boats infront of the resort however I never smelled any of the fumes that other guests apparently smelled. We did find that if you walk down the coast you would be able to enjoy a nicer beach with even better water than what is infront of the resort. For a minimal fee you could be taken on a snorkeling trip where you could see tons of fish and all the coral reefs.

I am so glad that I chose Grand Coco Bay despite some of the negative reviews I'd read because it was absolutely perfect for us. First of all, I have to say I've had the opportunity to stay at a \"5 star\" hotel in the US and Europe. A room alone has cost me in the range of $450 - $650 per night, so I really don't understand how some of the people who stayed at this all-inclusive resort could complain the way they did in their reviews. The cost per day for the two of us for everything was barely over $300. Simply put, the hotel was very clean, comfortable, relaxed and friendly. We especially liked the fact that it was not a big resort and there was never a problem of not having a beach chair or a long wait to use water sport equipment. Although the food was not outstanding, it was good. There was a wide variety to choose from and we ate well...maybe even a little too well! We met some really wonderful people during our stay, but the heart and soul of this resort is the utterly fantastic \"entertainment crew\". These young men, (and everyone who has stayed here knows who they are), were TERRIFIC. They worked very long hours each day and were so friendly and willing to do anything that they could to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. They organized soccer and vollyball games on the beach, lead fitness classes, made sure you were happy and they often participated in the evening entertainment which was lots of fun. I can't say enough good things about them, and I hope the management of the hotel realizes that they create a great atmosphere at the resort. All the guests that I spoke with felt the same as I did and agreed that without them it would not have been nearly as fun. They rock big time!

Since I prefer smaller resorts, this was just perfect for us. The pool, pool bar were super and the beach is the best in my opinion! since the hotel was not full occupied, there was never a hard time finding a chair either by the pool or the beach. The staff at the pool bar and the bar by the restaurants were very efficient and on the ball at all times. One thing is a must and that is bring a big insulated mug! boy, was I glad I did. Every morning I would go down, after it had opened up, and they would give me a huge bloody mary in my mug...gotta love that. The drinks were always very good. I did not find them to be weak at all nor did I find the beer to be watered down...not sure how that can happen when it comes from tap. I like wine so when I had my fill of beer and margaritas I just wanted a nice glass of wine. I am not fond of their house wine so I bought a bottle of Pino Grigo at the Italian restaurant for $18.00 but boy, was it worth it! Kept it in the room for those nights sitting out on the balcony!

First, I must qualify my review by saying the first 3 times we went to Mexico we stayed at the Omni in Cancun. We were spoiled there and knew it would be hard to beat. We are beach bums who like to soak up the sun, relax, eat, drink and be merry. This resort was nice, there is alot of staff and they do work very hard all the time. The entertainment staff was great and fluently spoke several different languages. They also really looked out for the girls to make sure none of the guy guests were bothering them or being inappropriate during games etc. The grounds are nice and the exterior lighting at night was beautiful. The walk to Playa is beautiful with lots of colorful hotels to see along they way. This hotel was not crowded like the others we saw and the facilities are much closer to the beach than those we saw along the way. There was not enough information in writing to read about the hotel. No map, etc. This was frustrating because the staff didn't understand English as well as we thought they might. When ordering off their menu at the snack bar (that was written in english)we got the wrong thing more than once, but sometimes it seemed like they cooked what they felt like and thats what you got. The all inclusive option is great for kids but on more than one occaision mine was ignored or put off at the snack bar. The room service that is included is Seriously limited (like no hot breakfast items). The service was marginal - several times we approached a counter or the doorway of the restaurant and were not aknowledged and had to seat ourselves or ask to be served. The staff didn't smile much so even when they did offer help it sometimes felt like we were inconviencing them. We thought the food was \"not good\". The buffet line was dry and the hot entree that was being prepared at the grill each night was slow and unimpressive. On BBQ night we were expecting to see shrimp, chicken, ribs and steak, but instead got thin strips of chicken and beef being fried on the pancake grill. Our experience at the fancy Italian restaurant was also a disappointment. They make it difficult to get into the nicer restaurants by only taking 2 seatings one at 8:30 and one at 9:30pm. You have to book your reservations in person,(not on the phone)in the morning between 7 and 11am and have to dine that night only. So you can not make them for the next night if they are full when you get there to make your reservation - and they only seat about 20 people at each seating. I didn't understand why all those boats were parked infront of this resort. To the left there is a mile or two of coastline with no resorts... why they are not parked over there is questionable. They do distract from the view but aren't bothersome otherwise I guess. We liked it there - it was our kind of resort small, close to the beach, entertaining and clean.

We could not find anything to complain about during our entire stay. Check in and out was very easy; and they even asked us if we preferred a certain room. We hit the lottery on that choice; the location of our room was prime. Our room was very clean and spacious, for three women on a getaway. We left a tip with a note for the maid everyday asking for extra towels, and she left extra towels and supplies for us everyday. She did a good job of cleaning and organizing our chaos everyday. We went into town on arrival and each bought our own gallon of bottled water to keep in the fridge. Taxis were readily available and only charges $3 to go into town. The resort also kept track of us when we left the premises by asking our room number and taking count of us. When we returned they checked us off the list. We brought our own mugs and kept those filled with water from the restaurants/bars to drink while lying around the pool or at the beach. The pool was beautiful and ran the length of the resort, and there were always loungers available somewhere around the pool, either in the sun or the shade, at all times; the same was at the beach. They were constantly cleaning the pool and pool area at all hours of the day. Same could be said for the entire resort; cleaning always going on. The buffet offered a large variety of foods for breakfast and lunch and features theme nights. We always found something we wanted to try on the buffet. There is a snack bar near the pool bar that offers burgers, hot dogs, chicken, pizza, nachos, fries, and ice cream. I personally liked the nachos with the fresh guacomole (sp). The Mexican and Italian restaurants are also excellent. I only wish we could have eaten at each again before we left, but we kept ourselves quite busy with activities. The beach was beautiful with fine powdery sand that was kept clean by the staff. There were boats anchored just outside the swimming area, but they did not interfere with going in the water, and I thought they added to the charm/scene. The view is not blocked and there was very little activity with the boats. Most sat anchored all week. Also there were no vendors on the beach so you could relax without worry. The activities staff was always 'on', but they never forced you participate if you weren't interested and just wanted to relax. The bar by the dining area and the pool bar were open all day, and the lobby bar was open for the evening. The lobby bar was surrounded by tables and chairs for guests to sit and visit. The service was superb at all times. The show started at 9PM each evening and lasted about 30 minutes. They're not Broadway shows, but they are very entertaining. The staff always had a smile and were helpful, and the service we received was awesome. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is conveniently located near Play del Carmen, is clean, and has an awesome beach. Great food and a wonderful staff. As an extra note, we highly suggest taking a Coba Mayan Encounter tour with Alltournative. It is an experience you will never forget. It was the highlight activity we did during our stay. Be sure to get plenty to eat before leaving though, and take along a bottle of water. It is a very physical excursion and its hot out there in the jungle. We repeled into a cenote, kayaked across a lake, ziplined across a lake, ate with a Mayan family, and then climbed Coba, the tallest pyramid in the Yukatan Pennisula. We also did a Paradize Reed Snorkel, which was awsome. We asked our Funjet representative if there was something we should absolutely see or do before leaving and he sent us to Chichen-Itza. We personally did not enjoy that excursion because we spent more time on the bus than at the site (it was a three + hour ride), and it was also very touristy - not a genuine Mexican or Mayan experience; but everyone has their own idea of fun and I'm sure there are lots of people who really enjoy Chichen-Itza. All in all I cannot say enough good things about the resort and the area. I hope anyone else who stays here finds it just as enjoyable and relaxing.

If, however, you like 5 star accomodations and you believe their ad that says they are 5 star, DON'T!) We spent two weeks her from Feb. 10- 24,2006 and were horrified by the state of the resort. Worse than the fact the resort was a mess was the attitide of the staff. They let you know the town was full and you would just have to put up with them and they couldn't care less. Here are some of the things we put up with: -the hotel ran out of water. No water in the bar, the restaurants, the store or at the front desk. When I demanded water they finally found three little bottle but said I could not purchase the bottles because they had no money and I did not have exact change. I question how the desk and the store could have no money and they told me even their so called \"money exchange\" had no money. (during our trip they also ran out of diet soda and tequilla... since we don't drink, those were not an issue to us but there sure were some very angry people!) -our bed broke due to wood rot and my daughter and I slammed into the headboard with enough force to swell up my head. It took 9.5 hours of fighting to get the bed fixed. They did finally bring a new bed and put the old one in the hallway where it remained for 10 days so people were tripping over it. The light was held onto the wall with medical tape. When it fell off they didn't even put on new tape they just propped it up. -the tv didn't work -they didn't prepare enough food for the resort so more than half of the buffet was empty all the time and the \"snack\" bar was out of half of it's items at all times and only open part of the posted hours. -the staff was very rude and wouldn't even make eyecontact with you. -BUGS!!! Our first week the weather was cool so the airconditioner was fine. The second week was hot and humid so the airconditioner died and the bugs came. We were swarmed with ANTS. My neck was swollen from the bites and two weeks later my daughters stomach is still scarred from bites. The hotel did not care about the situation at all. YOu would pick up the shampoo in the shower and bugs would run all over. -NO HOT WATER for two weeks we had freezing cold water. They tested the temperature and it was 50F, They told us that was as hot as their water gets. We paid for a 5 star hotel and then paid 350US extra upon arrival to get their \"best\" ocean front room and had these problems...imagen what the \"bad\" rooms are like.(other rooms had no water at all, or leaking airconditioner, toilets that wouldn't flush etc) - the drain in the tub didn't work but the water was cold it didn't matter but my husband tried to shave and the pipe under the sink was broken so the water drained all over the floor and my makeup suitcase that I had stored there. I presumed the plumbing work; I presumed wrong! -they finally offered to change our room and we jumped at the chance. We walked to the front desk to be met by the manager and were told to jump in the lake. They would not move us, would not fix the situation and we could just leave if we didn't like it. I have never seen such rudeness at a hotel. Every day you would hear people at the desk screaming about something. WE paid as much for this hotel as we did for Xpu Ha Palace Resort (a truly five star hotel). We were robbed. So, if you get this place cheap and like bugs and \"roughing\" it good luck here. IF you want decent clean accomodations DON'T.

Every bit the 4 rating Room: Very clean and spacious. Huge double closet with sliding mirrored doors. Plenty of hangers and a few shelves. The refrigerator is located inside the dresser cabinet, which leaves 3 drawers for clothing. Each of the nightstands has a drawer with open space below. Table with 2 chairs and a TV on a stand. There are 4 sodas/juice. No Beer. They came every few days to check on the inventory. Large bathroom with makeup mirror, hairdryer, shampoos, lotions and soap. Washcloths provided. Thick bath towels. No bottled water in rooms. We brought our own bottle and filled it at the restaurant. All rooms had a view of either the pool or ocean. Pool: The hotel is built in a square horseshoe shape. The pool is set in the center and runs the entire length of the hotel. 4 \u00bd deep with a ledge in various spots so you can sit on the edge.. There is also an area of the pool where the loungers can sit in the pool. Kiddy pool at one end at wading depth. The pool bar is located about at mid point of the pool. Three Jacuzzis located at the ocean end of the pool along with showers. Very clean pool and pool area. You would see staff cleaning the pool daily, as well as testing the water and cleaning the lounging area around the pool. Dining: Excellent dining. The buffet offers a large variety of foods for breakfast and lunch and features theme nights. Caribbean, Mexican, International, Italian, Gala, Oriental, and BBQ. Appropriate dress is enforced including a cover up over swim suits. There is a snack bar near the pool bar that offers burgers, hot dogs, chicken, pizza, sandwiches, fries, and ice cream. The nice part of this is that you order your food and it is made at that time, it is not pre-cooked and left to sit under a heat lamp. Condiments are added by the staff per your order. The Mexican and Italian restaurants are also excellent. Same day reservations are required. With seating beginning at 6:30PM and hourly there after. Both require men to have long pants and shoes on. This is strictly enforced. Beach: Best beach in the area by far. You can walk the beach going north for quite some time/distance before coming to anything. Going south, a 10 to 15 minute walk on the beach will bring you to the first pier in Playa del Carmen. Two blocks from the pier is 5th Avenue. You can also walk to the second pier via the beach. The area between the two piers is overcrowded, smells of fish, has boats tied one after another so you have to step over all the ropes, seaweed is all over. Many of the restaurants/bars and hotels were damaged by the hurricane and appear to be either closed or of limited use. The beach at Grand Coco Bay is a beautiful sandy beach with a nice swimming area. Yes there are boats anchored just out front of the hotel but do not interfere with going in the water. The boats are out further. The view is not blocked and there was very little activity with the boats. Most sat anchored all week. There was never a problem getting a beach chair or a chair by the pool. The palapas were occupied early but people were always on the move so they would open up at various times. No vendors on the beach which was a real treat. The activities staff was great. They let you know when a new activity was starting but were never pushy about getting you to join. Beach towels were obtained by exchanging your towel card for a towel. They did allow you to exchange a used towel for a clean towel at the end of the day (based on availability) so that you could go to the beach early. The towel/activities desk did not open before 8AM. Bars: The sports bar at Grand Coco Bay was damaged by the hurricane and they are working hard to re open it. The bar by the dining area and the pool bar were open all day, and the lobby bar was open for the evening. The lobby bar was surrounded by tables and chairs for guests to sit and visit. The service was superb. Shows: The show started at 9PM each evening and lasted approx. 30 minutes. The show was in the theatre just off the lobby. Good variety with the entertainers being the activities staff. It was set up much like a dinner theatre with tables placed in between chairs in the first few rows. Waiters came to take drink orders during the show. Check In: Efficient staff make check in a breeze. Check out was equally quick. Other notes: Extremely clean hotel, even the bartenders wore hair nets. The restrooms by the pool/beach were cleaned constantly. The restaurants and common areas were very clean with constant maintenance going on. 2/3 of the restaurant wall was glass and it was always being cleaned. Someone was constantly walking around on the beach picking up guest glasses. Guards were constantly watching over the beach area so \u201cnon-guests\u201d did not stop and use the chairs. Occasionally \u201cnon guests\u201d did stop and were quickly asked to move along. Plenty of taxi\u2019s available. We were told it was $3.00 to get a taxi to town. There was a water taxi you could take over to Cozumel. Tickets could be purchased at either pier in town. The staff always had a smile and were helpful. Most understood the English language. The service we received was awesome. I would highly recommend this hotel. It is conveniently located near Play del Carmen, is clean, and has an awesome beach.

The reason we were there was because we were bumped from Sandos Caracol Village (which we booked) due to it not being open because of the Hurricane. First of all I am not one to complain and feel very bad about all the misfortune in this area because of the Hurricane. We were not told we were coming to Grand Coco until we arrived at the airport in Cancun. We decided to make the best of it. The food was pretty good. Good variety. The snack bar was great. Staff was great. Very friendly. Rooms were clean. Telling us not to drink the water and then charging for it at an all- inclusive was very tacky to say the least. Also charging $3.00 a day for a lock safe in your room. The pictures that you look up online of the beach look wonderful until you get there and there are 15 to 20 boats parked in front of the hotel every day. Yes you can walk down the beach, but the chairs and lounges you sit on are in front of the boats. We brought our 7 year old along and couldn't enjoy the swimming pool (there is only one) that everyone gathers by with their children due to the fact that from 1p.m. to 5p.m a group of selfish ADULTS decided it was ok to get drunk, dirty dance and moon everyone by the pool. It would have been nice if the staff told them to stop and consider the other guests, but they were too busy participating in the charade. It would be fine at an all adult hotel but this isn't. It has a kids club, which means it is family oriented. Those adults should have been taken aside and told to wait till late night when the kids were sleeping if they needed to entertain each other.

This is our combined review. To start with the Entertainment staff was fabulous. They kept young and old busy at all times. It didn't matter whether the sun was shining or it was raining they did their job well. The bartenders, waiters, and waitress were also very friendly and ready to please. They were greatful for a tip, but they were not snobish if they didn't receive one. The food was wonderful, they had a different theme night every night. If you went away hungry it was your own fault. The desserts were fabulous and many to choose from. A MUST SEE is 5th Ave. it is a 15 minute walk from the resort. You can spend many hours there. There are internet cafes and many different shops. You can hop the ferry to Cozemel from there, buy your souvieners or book trips. We went back 3 times. Don't walk alone. This area is still recovering from the hurracane. I don't think anything would happen, but just wouldn't want to take the chance. Some of the staff at the front desk were rude when you had a question or wanted something, but if you wanted to spend your money they were all over you. Also beware of some staff members posing as maids to get into your room just to pick up the tip and leave. And when the real maid gets there there is no tip for her. They are short staffed in the maid department and it takes them all day to get to all the rooms. (202 rooms) There were only 3 days that our room was made up before 4 pm. Check your locks and dead bolts some of them don't work, also the safes. Rooms are large and clean. They no longer put beer and water in the mini bars. They told us that the staff was drinking the beer so this is why they stopped. Take a couple of water bottles with you and you can fill them up at the buffet resturant. Over all we would rate the Grand Coco Bay Resort a nice place to relax and renew old friendships. As long as you don't mind a little bit of construction. You will enjoy you stay. As for us to return.

Keep in mind that you are staying at an economical resort and not the Ritz, Iberostar, or Sandals properties so don't expect to have perfect everything. We were very fortunate to have an oceanside room, the view was amazing!

Bar service - Way better than average. All the bartenders were very polite and got to us when they could. If you wanted a stiffer drink, slip them a couple $$ and they'll remember you for the rest of your stay:) Staff - Above average. When you remember the fact that you are in their country and not the other way around, that probably will help you realize that not everyone is going to speak English to you own liking.

The beach is beautiful but 50 yards out in the ocean there are a large amount of boats speeding around. So it was just not safe to snorkel.

We knew we were not staying at a 5 star hotel, but we didn't figure the staff to be not helpful and the dining facilities to be less than par. Bugs in the water and on the table cloths in the buffet room were a daily occurence. The food was okay, but we had to make sure it was cooked, raw eggs and uncooked meat are things to watch out for. We had to approach the bar to get drinks while dining, and find our own cups and coffee for morning. The best food we ate was at the \"snack bar\" which included rotiserre chicken, quesadillas, hamburgers, pizza, and chips/dip. If you want to eat good food at this hotel, plan to eat at the snack bar.

We got to our room and of course the AC did not work. SO we had to switch rooms. We carried our bags back to the front desk and were give a room on the other side of the complex. We took our bags all the way over there and our key didn't work, so we walked back 5 minutes to the desk and were give another key. We then walked all the way back and no surprise the key still did not work. The food was very poor, and when I say poor I mean very, very poor. No selection and what they did have was either not cooked correctly or just plain bad. Not to mention the drinks were clearly watered down. I also agree with the previous reviewer, there are bugs all over the buffet and the tables in the restaurant. The shows at night were nothing special and most of the staff including the activities staff spoke very little English. So obviously it was difficult to communicate.

Melina, Dan, Max, Paco and all the rest were fun, calm, and dedicated workers. They evacuated us to a nearby school for 4 days (3 nights) and although we slept on tile floor and one night on a locker, we had blankets, pillows and a towel. We also had plenty of food and water. Hot food during a hurricane? I don't know how they did it, but it was quite entertaining when someone knocked on our classroom door and said, \"Hot chocolate?\" Don't get me wrong, it was the scariest experience of my entire life. We could hear, but not see the rain pounding on the windows and door. And during the worst of it there were 42 people in a regular sized classroom. Lots of different nationalities made for some very interesting interactions. Did I mention the law that you can't serve or sell alcohol two days before and two days after a hurricane? We made friends with other Americans and eventually, with the staff. We were all in the same boat, waiting to get out of there. We played lots of Rummy. The thing that sucked was that if they wanted to keep their jobs, the workers, including Dan and Max, had to get into the pool and start dumping out sand and other gross stuff. For $30 every two weeks? Fat chance. The food wasn't the best, but the beach, the size of the hotel, the service all overshadowed it. Another thing that really got me was that they charged us $100 for each extra night we stayed there beyond our reservation. It was a 'special hurricane rate.' We didn't have much of a choice, since the radar tower at the airport was completely shot, so we had to pay it. We talked to people from other hotels at the airport and found out that they got charged even more!

The opening line was \"First you pay $50 US per person extra for the new year dinner, and then we will give you your room key\". We paid, and went for lunch to found that the quality of the buffet was terrible. The snack bar really is the only place that offers something decent (if you want to pay for All Inclusive and only eat hamburgers and quesadillas) It was new year, so we just wanted to have a good time. When we got our room (2 beds, when we requested king) we found that the TV and lights were not working. The towels looked grey and old. But again, it was new year, we were still trying to have fun. We arrived to the restaurant to enjoy our special new year dinner ($50 USD per person), again the unfriendly staff did a big effort to make this dinner a terrible one. I will just mention a few details: * Holes in our tablecloths * Bugs on the water * Bugs on top of the table * 10 minutes to get a waiter to come a take the order for drinks (the restaurant was not even full) * We asked for gin tonic and we got water with gas, the house wine tasted like vinegar * The food was mediocre (for $50 US per person you cabn get something really good at any restaurant in Playa del carmen) But the worst thing was that nobody offered an apology after we complained 4 times for all the issues. I hope the management of the hotel reads this. It is a shame to call that place a \"hotel\" because they obviously don't know anything about \"hospitality\".

Apparently when we were there the hotel was in the middle of changing owners so because of the changes I feel we kind of got a raw deal on some of the services. The food was downright disgusting most of the time. Very little variety and it was very apparent the hotel was trying to cut corners where ever possible. Our room was leaking the first day and we talked to the reception and were given another room. This room was not leaking, however it did have ants everywhere. Once again we switched rooms and this one was finally ok. By the way Melina at Guest Services was an absolute doll. She bent over backwards trying to correct problems that were obviously not her fault. The real shining point of this hotel is the entertainment. THEY WERE AMAZING. The head of the shows, was an American named Dan. Mark my words this guy one day will be a star. HE WAS HYSTERICAL!!! To this day my husband and I still crack up thinking about some of the things he would say. He alone was almost worth the price to go down. The entertainment staff worked day and night providing us with water aerobics, volleyball, spanish classes, and a variety of other fun filled activities. The shows at night are kind of repetitive but as long as Dan was hosting them there was never a dull moment.

My hubby and I were there Oct 9-16 '05. We were only back 5 days before Wilma. The hotel was very quiet for the majority of the week, which was perfect for us. Room: We were given a nice room with a pool view but we opted to stay in one of the ocean view rooms instead. This was the highlight of our vacation. We had a breath-taking view of the sea. We were located two rooms over from the sports bar but it wasn't a problem as the bar was closed for most of the week due to some minor repairs. The ocean view beside us was vacant as were the one above us so we basically had the entire wing to ourselves. I had heard that the hotel walls were paper thin and was concerned. We were able to listen to our music very loud most days and never heard a peep from the other rooms. We had a big balcony with two chairs and a big wooden railing to put your feet on :-) We brought some rope with us and made clothing line to hang our we bathing suits. It was very breezing on the balcony so ours clothes dried really fast. Most evenings and afternoons we sat on our balcony and soaked up the beuatiful surroudings from high up. Beach: as beautiful as all the pictures or more so. We walked up the beach towards playa del carmen several times and I have to say the reef has one of the nicest stretches and less busy. The water was warm and crystal clear. We swam for a few hours every day and it was soo nice. We found that we did not have to leave the area in front of the hotel to find a nicer spot. The beach goes on and on either direction to if you prefer something more priviate - however be cautious heading north towards cancun along the public beach. We ran into some locals who lets just say were trying to make a quick buck in a not so nice way. Pool: The pool is very nice and the swim up bar is very fun. We met all kinds of nice, and some very drunk people from all over the world lol. We met all sorts of other canadians which was nice. We swam at the pool every day and sometimes at night. I believe it's open until 10pm. I recall the swim-up bar closing at 6pm, however the bartendars don't leave right at 6 and some will continue to serve a few drinks if you're nice to them. The bartendars are all very nice and if you give them a tip now and then they really appreciate it and will give good service. Grounds: Very pretty and intimate hotel. we loved the openness of it and all the plants and flowers throughout. The overall design is nice and everything is close by. The lobby is nice for lounging, especially at night when they have some live music. Restaurants/food/Drinks: We didn't really care for the al le carte restaurants. The food was okay and it was just too formal to be honest. We were more comfortable at the buffet restaurant where you can serve yourself at your own pace. The atmospehere is great at the buffet restaurant, especially in the mornings. They play lovely music all day and it's very relaxing - except for when the pool is playing loud dance music, which is late morning. The buffet has a theme each night and we loved them all. Mexican and Italian were our favorites. The morning buffet is nice but they could have had more fresh fruit available. They had some, but not as much as most other resorts we've travelled to in the caribbean. There is a little bar beside the grill area that always had spicy sauces, salsa and guacamole, limes etc. Nice accents for any meal and nice on ommelettes. The coffee isn't too bad in the restaurant and even through I am a coffee snop I drank some. It's no Tim Hortons but not much is. The buffet always seemed to have a good selection and lots of variety. We ate at the snack bar every day to for snacks. They have good chips salsa and guacamole. I liked their regular french fries to and the ice cream was good. After a while everything at the snack bar started to taste the same as they use the same oil for everything but it was still good. I had heard previously that it was open until 2am but it closes at like 6pm. Drinks were good. My husband said the corona was not as good as it is back home but he still enjoyed quite a bit. The mini bar contains modella and some pop.. would have appreciated something for the non beer drinker. We drank plenty of the water but were NOT charged, I think because we upgraded to a better room and they didn't care. They also did not charge us for our safe, which is a savings of $3 per day. Staff: The people that work at the reef are AWESOME. The waiters in the buffet restaurants are my favorite of all the staff. They bring your drinks to you and basically take care of whatever else you need while you're there. They could not do enough for us. We tipped about every other day a couple of bucks. They REALLY appreciated it and they totally deserve it as they work so hard and are always smiling. The animation staff were really nice and my husband really hit it off with them. In fact, he hit it off with all the staff and each of them greeted us with enthusiasm daily. We brought some candy along to snack on while in our room and we gave much of it out to the staff daily. Most of them put it away and brought home to their children, which is very sweet :) They were so happy at the gesture as lots of people that visit the hotel treat them as servants. We had a great time at the hotel but it's defintely not a 5 star. Not sure why they advertise it so. The area where the hotel is located is 5 star for sure, as is the beach. The hotel itself was a 4 star and there were little things that they could have done to make things better overall. For instance our bath tube would not drain very well and the water pressure was poor. The showers at the pool were far superior!!!! The comforter on our bed has a big stain on the inside of it, which wasn't a big deal but every heard of bleach? They try really hard which is what counts and overall it was a very nice hotel and experience. Oh and go into Playa del Carmen a few times and do some shopping and sightseeing. We got some nice souveniers and didn't have to pay an arm and a leg. The vendors are SOOOO pushy but you just have to be able to ignore then and keep walking. They will say just about anything to get you into their store. Make sure you barter a bit. We paid $10 US for a nice mexican blanket that someone tried to sell us for $50 about 10 minutes earlier. We went for drinks at one of the bars along the strip and it was nice to sit and people watch. The bar we went to gave us free chips and salsa which was so good.

We had paid for a much higher quality hotel but once we got off the plane we were moved to 2 lower quality hotels by Royale Tours. After complaining, we were told by Katia of Royale Tours to either accept Coco Beach or that we would be on our own on the streets of Cancun or Playa del Carmen. So be forewarned about this shady travel agency. We were moved to Reef Coco Beach after being moved from Club Med after complaining about the condition of Club Med's room and site. To get to Reef Coco Beach, you have to travel through a part of the town that is in construction and delapidated buildings -- locals live in some of these buildings which should be condemned. So it's not an attractive drive to get to the hotel. During our stay at Reef Coco Beach, we never had internet access and always got the same lame reply, \"We're working on it.\" Room service could possibly take 1 1/2 hr to deliver anything. It took that long for us. In fact, if you call to check where your order is, Room Service will simply refuse to answer the phone. So, you are ignored until you call the hotel manager and complain. Also, during our stay, the power went off -- but only partially for like 1/3 of the hotel. We had only our lights working-- no air conditioning for about 2-3 hours. At the front desk of the hotel, we talked to other occupants who were complaining and they told us that nothing worked in their rooms. The staff essentially \"blew us off.\" When we talked to the female hotel manager, she essentially blew us off as well -- except with a smile. In fact, while there were about 4 men (including my male companion) complaining about this outage, she was in the hotel lobby playing with a guest's baby. She never dealt directly or seriously with anyone. Very unprofessional and the staff behind the desk looked stressed. To be fair, I have to say that the food in the 2 restaurants was delicious and all of the bartenders could mix mean margaritas and pina coladas. You do have a nice view from the Reef. The hotel is U-shaped so that most rooms get an oceanview. The hotel is about 10 minutes walking distance from the major shopping street -- which anyone can tell you what the name of that street is. I can't remember presently. (Remember, you're walking through unpleasant neighborhood to get to the main shopping street.) When shopping, remember to walk farthest away from the hotels because the prices for the same items drop by $5 -$20. Everyone is selling the same thing and people are more willing to bargain the farther you are ... just get away from the hotels. TOURISTS GET RIPPED OFF near the hotels b/c most tourists aren't willing to bargain, a most exhausting activity. The rooms in Coco Beach are like a slightly smaller version of Holiday Inn -- no kidding. Small bugs are always present in the bath and in the room. You can't get rid of them. Housekeeping employees do not arrive until about 9 or 10 am. To put things in perspective ... If you're a Holiday Inn type of person and don't mind small bugs everywhere, you will be satisfied with Reef Coco Beach.

At first it seemed kind of seedy. When you pull up it is on a side street off the main road so you are like..where are we going? Once you get up to the actual resort you are like...ah, this is nice. If you have been to other AI resorts, this one is small. There is no long walk to take to get from your room to the pool or to eat. Everything is very close. The hotel is in a horseshoe shape opening up to the private beach. The pool is in the middle part. It's a kind of lagoon pool with lots of places to perch and a swim up bar. Bring your own floaties. I saw very little damage on the property. The main thing was the vegetation had been stripped but you could see it growing back already. The beachfront is spacious and we had no problem finding a palapa to claim for the day (be on the beach early -before 9 am- to get a great covered spot!) I thought the public beaches on each side would bother me but it didn't. The water was great and the sand soft. Sunday is the big \"take the family to the beach\" day in Mexico so you will see a definite rise in the beach population of locals. The security gaurds politely get rid of any wanderers without resort bracelets. The food was really good compared to other resorts I'd been to. The restaurants were EXCELLENT! This is a thumbs up from a self-acclaimed foodie. The steak in the Italian place was tender and the appetizers& soups in the Mexican dining room rocked. Try the stuffed relleno...it is a pepper but not real hot like a jalepeno, very mild. Bees...lots of bees. THey are friendly and not aggressive. They are around most of the bars and the outdoor dining area. I didn't see anyone get bit and the bartender let one crawl on him to show the kids to not be afraid. Bring your EPI pen just in case if you are severely allergic. I did get the strange rash that someone else had posted about. It was a mild, non-itchy, splotchy rash on my legs from the waist down. I'm not sure what it was but it was either from the chair, towel or sun. Needless to say bring some Benadryl and plan on sleeping well that night. The room was clean. Put a can of airfreshner in a baggie your check in luggage or bring some scented candles to get rid of the slight musty odor. Febreeze would probably work well too. The bed is firm and the pillows flat. If you have neck/back problems you might want to pack your personal pillow. One thing...a photographer and his assistant come on the property daily with a \"jungle\" animal for you to take pictures with. You don't have to pay for the pictures unless you want to keep them (about $8 apiece). He would bring a different animal daily...squirrel monkey, parrots, iguana. They also take family portraits out by the beach. All of the images were very professional.

We arrived Saturday afternoon and had no problem at all checking in. We upgraded to a Beach Front Room (room 2401) for an additional $25 per night (they only took cash for this) and Check-In was a Breeze. When we got there it seemed so quiet and deserted and there was no one around barely. Our room wasn't ready for another hour so we went up to the room with a Man who carried our luggage for us and stored it in the room while they cleaned it. The front desk and this Man were very helpful. The Resort itself is located on a great stretch of Beach and to the left is a beautiful stretch of Public Beach which was crowded with Locals on the weekend but the security kept anyone not staying at the Resort away from the Beach that belonged to the Hotel. To the right is a Dive Shop, A small Beach Restaurant/Bar and then a great and very entertaining Bar next to that on the beach that played Music all day and had swings to swing on instead of Bar stools-def. recommend checking it out-Well Worth It!! The Property was Very Clean and there was always someone cleaning something. Whenever it rained (for about 5-10 min. a day), the employees would immediately be out cleaning and squeegy-ing the floors (they get very slippery). The resort is small and pretty quiet b/c it never seemed crowded. Everything is conveniently located and after seeing how far other resorts are (Playacar, etc) from the town, I think Reef Coco Beach is in an excellent location. POOL: We never went in the pool but it seemed very nice and there were always chairs available to lounge on. I saw someone cleaning it every morning. It was a little more filled with kids and families and the activities like volleyball, \"the crazy game\", etc. during the day so we stuck to the beach. BARS: The Lobby Bar: was nice and relaxing and got somewhat crowded early in the evening and then emptied out. The Bartender there was very nice and so was the Waitress (Ellio and Carolina). The drinks were excellent and so was the service. They had a man there playing the trumpet for a few hours a night-it was kinda corny as he played with a tap eof Music but if you used your imagination and didn't see that there was only 1 man playing you would think there was a full band there. Papo's Sports Bar: This bar was right over the Beach and was only open at night also. Most nights it was very empty and is very laid back with couches and TVs all around. The only night that there was alot of people and some action was Wed. where alot of people took part in the Karaoke. It was nice to get a drink there and sit outside over the beach on the balcony up there. They also had a self-serve popcorn Machine but it was only working 1 night. The Beer served in the Bars was great as it was served in Frosty Mugs! The Swim up Bar was also very good but they only served drinks in small plastic cups so we used our own cooler mugs that we brought from home to take with us on the Beach although there is someone who takes drink orders all day on the Beach also. FOOD: The 2 Especialty Restaurants were great and gave you a significant amount of food. I would recommend ordering the full 3-4 course meal though as the main entrees are on the fancier side and are much smaller. We had no problem making reservations by about 9am that day. The service was a little slower here but good. The Italian Restaurant had a few waiters in Tuxedos who walked around and sorta made us nervous-just the way they watched over everyone. It was a little too up-tight. But the food was great. The Buffet however wasn't so good. It seemed very repetitive and didn't have much of a selection. There are two displays of food but the both sides have the same things in them. There were theme nights and they decorated the dining room really nice each night and the service was good but the food left a lot to be desired. They had a Mexican theme night the one night we were eating in the Especial Rest. so we didn't eat there but that food looked great and they had an Ecellent Mariachi Band playing. Also, Friady night was Oriental Night and that made to order stir fry was probably the best I had all week in the Buffet. The ROOM: Very Clean and neat. We had two dounble beds. We never got turn down service or mints but that is fine. Our mini-Bar was stocked almost every day. We never drank the $1 bottles of water but they tried to charge us for 2 at check-out and we fought it and they quickly took it off the bill. We had Room 2401 which was in the Corner on the 4th floor facing the ocean. It was a great room but alot of stairs esp. when you are hot and tired. Our dresser drawer wouldn't close one day and they brought someone up that day to fix it and a security guard stood with the man while he was in our room. This made us feel safe b/c they weren't just letting \"anyone\" in the room. THE BEACH: The Beach was great! Very relaxing and compared to the Resorts around us, it was never crowded like the other ones were. The Boats are a little strange but they weren't very bothersome at all and most of them are gone all day. There was someone usually cleaning the beach each day but one of the days you could tell they hadn't yet. This was Thursday I believe and that same day, at night, they did a very thurough cleaning and moved all of the chairs, etc out of the way. The water was clear, calm and beautiful. Overall, my husband and I had a great Vacation!! I wouldn't say the Reef Coco Beach is a 5 star but it sure does try! We were treated well and had all of the luxuries we could ask for on a vacation and esp. considering the price. We loved Playa Del Carmen and all of the Natives were very friendly.

I have never in my life seen a staff so dedicated and hard working as at the RCB. Before and after the hurricane they were great, and during the evacuation they were even better. The amazing staff stayed all night in the shelter with us (even though some of them weren't required to) and stayed awake all night keeping the guests safe and sane. I was amazed at the effort that was made to ensure our safety and comfort in a crisis situation. They provided good food and plenty of drinks, along with pillows and towels. They gave us updated information on the progress of the storm and went way above and beyond the call of duty to care for everyone. These same employees worked all day the next day(after being awake all night!) getting the hotel back in shape- even had a hot breakfast ready when the guests arrived back at 10am from the shelter. The clean up effort was incredible and they had the guests back in their rooms by the afternoon, despite all rooms having had several inches of water. Melina of guest services is a true angel along with Jorge Martinez and Miguel Lopez- just to name a few of the best employees I've ever encountered anywhere. We love and appreciate their true kindness and caring for others. We all also loved the location of the resort- it's nice being able to walk back and forth to Playa. In closing.

The staff are the hardest working and most considerate people. The accommidations were great. The all inclusive food/drinks/water was the only way to go. Everything thing there is so centrally located that you get to be friends with staff and guests. There are two great restaurants with amazing food (Italian & Mexican if you bring pants and closed toe shoes) and even better service. We spent one day at Xel-Ha and found it well worth the money. I plan to go back to both. Now the not so fun part. We were scheduled to leave on Sun the 17th @ 3:30. The Cancoon Airport closed for Hurricane Emily at 3:00. The hotel had nothing posted for airline closures and evacuated all guests and wait staff to a nearby two strory private school. My travel agency told us en route to the airport that our flight was cancelled and we should take shelter at the school with the other guests. There were six aprox. 20' x 20' class rooms with concrete walls, wood shutters for windows and tile floors. Each class room held aproximately 30-40 people. This is where the organization dropped dramatically. People began to horde towells for blankets and some people had 3 to 4 pillows. My wife and I were given no towells or pillows when we arrived and a fend for yourself attitude prevailed. Space was scarce and some people were very selfish. Unfortunately human decency faltered. Throughout the course of the storm we were drenched from wind carried rain being blown in the sides of the windows. After I had a shower of rain we ellected to evacuate our room for one on the other side of the school. This was probably within 45 minutes of the eye of the storm and I will never forget it, in fact it is still in my sleep. The next room was much better with much nicer people and several of the staff (who would give you the shirt off their back to make you more comfortable). This is where we continued to wait out the storm. We were at the school for about 24 hrs and no one was hurt. We survived our first hurricane! A final note: I will never use a travel agency again. Too many lies and the emergency phones were turned off! I will gladly go back to the Reef Coco Beach, except in storm season.

We had already changed from the Caracol due to bad reports, and we were equally concerned about the Reef Coco Beach having heard reports of over-booking and bad service. Check-In On arrival at Reef Coco Beach we sailed through check-in with no problems whatsoever, a porter showed us to our room along with our luggage. Room The room was lovely and spacious with a good view of the pool. The maid cleaned our room immaculately daily and provided clean towels even when we did not request them. The only disappointment was that the mini-bar was not refilled daily. Pool Area The pool was clean apart from a few flies that had decided to commit suicide in it. Nice temperature, not too cold! Plenty of sun loungers for everyone. Bars There are 3 bars the the Reef Coco Beach \u2013 the lobby bar, pool bar and sports bar. The pool bar was constantly busy during the day but service was good. The Lobby bar was busy from early evening to 9pm when people either went out or to the theatre to watch the show. The sports bar had no life whatsoever and constantly sent me to sleep. Best bet is to head to Fifth Avenue. Restaurants The snack bar was excellent during the day & late evening, selling tortillas, burgers, pizzas, chips and our personal favourite \u2013 Coconut Ice-cream. The buffet restaurant was excellent for breakfast but left a lot to be desired in the evening, although the choice was varied it was often cold no matter how early we sat. No complaints with the desserts though \u2013 very yummy indeed. Reef Coco Beach had 2 A\u2019 La Carte restaurants. It was nice to sit down to a menu & hot food \u2013 a welcome break from the buffet. There are 3 sittings daily for the A\u2019 La Carte restaurants but limited seats. Book by 8am to avoid disappointment. Beach The beach at Reef Coco is lovely and was a pleasant walk to the right in the morning at sunrise, and to the left in the evening to get to Fifth Avenue. The beach was clean and although the coast here did have lots of boats they did not spoil the enjoyment of it. There is a small hut where you can hire snorkel and scuba gear. Shows The shows at the resort are the norm but still very enjoyable. Entertainment Staff The entertainment staff at the hotel really made the holiday. They were extremely friendly and entertaining for both children and adults alike. They offered step, volleyball & crazy games which were hilarious. Overall a holiday to remember at Reef Coco Beach.

We were very happy with the overall quality of the hotel, its service staff, and our room. The only minor complaint I might have would be the plentiful, but bland food served at the buffet, but considering the extremely international clientele at RCB, I imagine that they are just trying to accommodate a variety of tastes. We were fortunate enough to be at the hotel when the eye of Hurricane Emily passed just south of Playa del Carmen. A couple days before the storm, we returned to find a note written in four languages attached to our door, advising everyone to remain calm and that the hotel had an evacuation plan. The next evening, they asked everyone to remain in the hotel, although the hurricane was not yet near us. At that point, they put an easel in the lobby advising us that on Sunday morning, they would move us to a school building about 5 blocks from RCB. We brought \"essentials\" with us, and the hotel stored our larger suitcases in sheltered rooms (most of them locked) by the lobby. At 10 AM Sunday, they sent the 300 or so of us that had not escaped to Cancun airport to the school by bus, and told us to camp out in the second floor classrooms. Then they proceeded to move the hotel to us!! They arrived in truckloads of workers, bringing beach towels, blankets, pillows, towels, and pillow cases and passed them to help us make the marble floors as comfortable as possible. Then they set up the cafeteria and served us lunch and dinner before the storm hit. After they made sure everyone had plenty of water and soda to drink and were as comfortable as possible, they set about boarding up windows and taping up glass. When the storm really hit at 9:30, however, many of the rooms still had minor flooding, so the staff moved as many as possible to other, drier rooms. The workers never slept; they spent the night squeegying and mopping up water from the floors until the storm finally moved on. The next morning at 10:00, they bussed us back to the hotel, where they served us breakfast in the theater off the main lobby. The thatched canopy over the front entrance had been blown to smithereens, the ground floor was flooded, and the buffet restaurant had lost all its vertical glass panels to the wind. There was no air, no electricity except by generator, no hot water. The pool was unusable, but the beach had no serious damage. The staff asked us to wait in the lobby until the rooms were cleaned, and opened the bar for non-alcoholic beverages. As the rooms were done, room numbers were called out, and everyone went to their rooms for a cold shower and some sleep. I was extremely impressed by how well we were treated at Reef Coco Beach. We heard some terrible horror stories from guests staying at other hotels on the Mayan Riviera and Coxumel. For instance, one group of British guests were told abruptly that their Coxumel hotel was closing and that they should take the ferry to the mainland and find other accommodations. Our hotel accecpted about 40 displaced people, and treated them just like the other guests, but one couple told us that the hotel that accepted them fed their \"real\" guests, and then offered them a large can of tuna, some mayo, and a can opener! We really felt like we had lucked out staying at RCB. They were organized, hard-working, and gracious throughout the whole ordeal. We never heard a harsh word from anyone, even though the staff was awake and working for at least 48 hours straight. In fact, during lunch the day after the storm, my friend went to get some water, and a waiter told her to sit down because \"You're tired. We'll wait on you!\" I know this is getting long, but I also want to mention the great service we got from the Funjet people. We flew UsAir, but Funjet and its representatives from Lomas, took care of our transfers from airport to hotel and back, and our side trips to Tulum (fair) and Xel-Ha (excellent!) Those guys were always available at the hotel, and even went with us to the shelter and came back the next morning to make sure their people had the latest news about their flights from Cancun airport. Needless to say, I will recommend Reef Coco Beach and Funjet to anyone going to the Mayan Riviera, and if we go back to that area, we will definitely stay with them!

I think I may have a different outlook than others. I am 22 and just graduated college, I went with my younger sister who is 20, and my parents on their 25th wedding anniversary. (we got lucky they took us along) and had different rooms as well. There was some construction going on when we were there (looked like a big addition off to the side) but after getting through that to the hotel, it was beautiful. The lobby is all open and it feels really tropical when you walk in. The rooms were above average, and We never had problems with the air conditioning at all. Everything about the rooms was great, except the walls are a little thin. The maids keep the rooms very clean, and at night we even got turn down service with chocolates on our pillows (could have been bc we told about our parents special anniversary - so if you are celebrating - let the front desk know. The pool and pool area were great, always clean. The pool has a swim up bar - and since the hotel was all inclusive this was one of my favorite areas. I noticed some people tipped the bartenders, and others didnt. As long as you were nice, and had fun with them, they treated everyone well. My favorite was Oswaldo - during they day he is at the swim up bar. Make him your friend if you like cocktails. Some of the people there get roudy, and others just sit back and relax. They also have a really nice sports bar that is open at night and always really air conditioned and has tv's all over if you want to keep up with your sports while in mexico. we read before we went that you should bring your own cups - my dad told me this, and i didnt want to look like an idiot and thought he was crazy, but when we got there, it was true, the cups are really small, whether you are drinking coke or corona you have to make alot of trips up there, and sometimes the bar gets crowded. DEF bring your own mug or cup, doesnt matter how big they fill up anything. As far as the food goes - breakfast buffet was really good, fresh fruit - made to order eggs any style really good and seemed to be open no matter how late you sleep in. There is always something to eat. If the buffet is closed, then the snack bar is open - and when i say open, it goes untill 2am if you have a late night craving. Burgers, hotdogs, chicken (really good), nachos, pizzas, fries, and ICE cream... i noticed the little kids loving this one. the buffet at night is good, but make sure you eat at the specialty resturants as the buffet gets kind of repetitive, although each night try to have a different theme. The italian one is really good, we ate there 3 times. And the rumors are true, you need to get up before 7 to sign up to eat there. But it is well worth it. As far as ages of people there when we were there, we noticed alot of couples, not very many teenagers, and some families with smaller children. During the day the event staff plans events, pool volleyball, water polo, beach soccer. They also have a dive shop by the hotel and there are trainers there to teach you how to scuba if you never have done it before. My dad and sister did this - first you go into the pool and try it out for about an hour, and if all goes well you pay around 100 bucks and they take you out in the ocean - make sure you go out when the weather is good - both my sister and dad got sea sick, but when down under the water said it was great. My whole family snorkeled- we have traveled alot and done quite a bit of this - and there are some reefs out there with some nice fish and coral. Also at the beach shack / dive shop you can check out equipment to do this for free if you want, or we just brought our own, they also have small boats (like small sail boats) that you can rent, kayak's - anything that is non-motorized was free, they also had jet ski's but you had to pay to use those. We are also really attached to our labtop with internet, and although we called and asked if they had wireless service in the lobby and said no, we brought it out there to try, and they did! So if you want to bring it along, we just sat on the couches in the lobby and did some emailing. They sweep the beach every other day, and have plenty of chairs by the pool and cabannas to lay under if you want to stay out of the sun. I think we found to be the truth that as far as decent swimwear the rules were anything goes. It seemed like no matter how big someone was - everyone was wearing bikini's, so ladies, no worries there was flesh everywhere - i even got my mom wearing one. some ladies even had the thong bottoms on, and as far as men there were speedos everywhere. We went into town alot (5th ave) about a 5-6 min cab ride into town - alot of good shopping, art, jewelery, shirts, everything. But make sure you bargain with them, they go down in price alot of you are starting to walk away. It is a really long strip of shops and the further you walk the cheaper stuff gets. Never had a hard time getting a cab, they were everywhere around there - 3 bucks into town 4 out - I think they let you take up to 4 in a cab. We went to Senor Frogs - not as fun as the ones in cancun or Poco - as I have been to both of those, we also got word of this place called the Blue parrot - get there early, to get a table, they have a night time fire show that is really neat to watch (we went to see it twice) they have tables on the beach and a big bar inside that has swings for seats - it was a really neat place, and after the fire show the dance floor fills up with teenager and people who party - so if you are into that it is the place to be, if not go for the fire show and leave. The show starts at 11 Like I read there is not a lot of night life in the hotel, but plenty in on 5th ave. Sometimes at night we would walk back on the beach to the hotel, really pretty and calm - the beach was def. white soft sand and was a relaxing walk. SO, overall I would go back, and had little to no complaints. Hope this helps from a perspective of younger adult, or for parents bringing kids my age.

Beautiful, bigger and great food! The RBC itself is great and very authentic mexican style resort , and it is very unfortunately we didn't have the same luck as my friends last year. Maybe with this new company that is taking over the Reef Coco beach perhaps will come back with better reviews later but until then I wouldn't recommend this hotel at this time.

I read the reviews religiously prior to our departure and felt like it was a 50/50 chance that we'd have a good time. There were 4 adults and 2 children traveling in our group. We wanted a smaller resort so that we could keep up with the kids a little easier. We had an early arrival so I made sure I had our swimsuits and sunscreen readily available. Check in went well...we requested oceanview rooms for an extra $25 a night (be prepared to pay in cash). We were only able to get one oceanview, but they were very accommodating and placed the rooms very close together. There was a sigh of relief once we got settled into our rooms since this seemed to be a negative experience for many people. We didn't observe or hear of this our entire stay. The rooms would compare to a Hampton Inn, nothing fancy, but definitely clean and acceptable. The boats were closer to the beach than I anticipated, but it didn't seem to bother anyone. It was interesting watching the locals load and unload their boats. The grounds were always clean and the staff worked diligently to keep the trash, used cups and plates picked up. The food was acceptable and very good at times. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the Italian restaraunt while the other two adults had a bad experience with the Mexican restaraunt. The buffet was always plentiful and had a good assortment of food. The snackbar was good as well. My husband tried the chicken wings on our last day and said they were delicious and wished he'd tried them sooner. Probably the most disappointing part of the resort was the nightly entertainment. The staff worked hard during the day and seemed more suited for the outdoor fun rather than the on stage fun. At times it appeared to be made up as they performed. The humor in the shows was \"tween\" humor and inappropriate at times for younger children. The kid club had a daily schedule which was nice to be able to pick and choose from the activities. There is a kiosk in one of the south walkways that you should visit. A young girl, Estella, runs it. Basically you pick your mexican plaster figurine and paint it. Once you're done, she takes it home to \"fire\" it and brings it back the next day. You'll be amazed at what you can do. She also sells some of her finished work which is beautiful. On the day it rained we decided to do the ATV and Speedboat tour. We missed the horseback riding which was okay because it didn't look like much fun. It was a great activity to do in the rain. We went to Tulum by private car set up by our Funjet rep. This is definitely the way to go. I took this advice by another review and trust me, you don't want to get stuck on a tour bus. It seemed expensive at first, $50 a person for 5 hours. But, we really didn't want to be stuck anywhere for an entire day. The ruins were beautiful...take or wear your swimsuit because there are 2 areas you can swim in if you like waves. I would not recommend this trip for children if you can avoid it. It was very hot and lots of walking. Our other outing was to Cozumel by ferry. We took a cab to Chankanaab National Park and snorkeled. It was beautiful and everyone had a good time. Like the other reviews, getting to the town of Playa del Carmen is very easy. You can walk down the beach to the pier or take a cab. We walked down in the morning and then took a cab home. One bit of advice, bring more cash than you think you'll need. At home we're so used to using our debit cards everywhere and don't think to have cash on hand. Luckily my husband surprised me and brought more cash than we talked about. The ferrys only took cash and some of the tours only took cash. You can use ATM machines in town, but we really only went there once. Also, if you're prone to mosquito bites, bring some spray. Two of us did manage to get quite a few bites on days it was not windy. All in all I'm glad I read the reviews prior to the trip because it did lend us a hand in some situations.

We are a family of four with a 13 year old girl and 15 year old boy. The resort was wonderful, clean and the food was more than acceptable. Staff were not all English speaking but certainly did their best to help out. The beach at the Reef Coco is exactly as per the pictures and internet sites we looked at. It does have a local beach right beside it but I found that not too many town's people went there. The resort is small so if you have \"tween\", it's great because you don't loose track of them. We did get bumped to another resort for the first night and ended up at the Sunscape. It felt a little dirty and dingy. The hallway to my room had a mattress leaning up against the wall, the fridge was not full and there was only one double bed in it. I'm glad I didn't pick that resort. Also, the beach was really small. Activity wise, they had quite a few things going for them. Free bungy trampoline, water trampoline and a floating \"iceberg\" that you could climb on. The kids enjoyed that part. For the inconvenience, Reef Coco has offered us one week free within the next year. We just have to make our way there. I'm sure the hotel was full because they couldn't provide us with the king size bed we had requested, yet there never seemed to have a lot of people at the beach or at the pool. We could always find chairs at either location but sometimes had a hard time finding one in the shade. It never felt small and crowded. The beach on either side went on for miles and miles. The buffet restaurant was never crowded and offered plenty of variety. Drinks were plentiful and not watered down in my opinion. I would have liked to experience different types of drinks but they really didn't offer a large menu to select from so I stuck to margaritas and beer. The food was not the same as a 5 star restaurant found in Ottawa but there was always something that was more than acceptable. The dinner at the Italian and Mexican restaurants were fabulous and very classy but almost impossible to get in. Plan on getting up at 7am and line up for making reservation for that evening. Too bad that sometimes we walked by those restaurants at dinner, only to find empty tables. Maybe they should offer a waiting list of some sort. I would not hesitate to recommend this resort to any family type of person. If you want to party, it's still OK but most of the vacationers had kids to low-teens. Then there's the 20-30 crowd. Everyone fits in. There's activities early in the morning for the early risers and the sports bar is open until 2am for the party'ers. One thing that did surprise me was the amount of people with really small children- even newborns, maybe a few too many. Most of them were close to the kiddy pool so we stayed on the beach. The real nice part of this resort is it's location -- 5 minutes to Playa del Carmen, a really nice town, with a quaint shopping \"street\" full of shops where you will find it all -- tacky souvenirs, $75 tequila, Lacoste clothes and Mexican wear plus all the restaurants you could imagine.

Make sure you put in reservations for the Mexican and Italian restaurant early in the morning. I always booked around 8am and had no problem. I did hear a woman tried to book around 9 am and they told her they were full. The times to choose were 630,730, and 830. The restaurants were nice. White linen table cloths and a nice atomosphere. The snack bar had pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, nachos. and ice cream. The breakfast buffet had made to order omlets, which were excellent. There was plenty of fresh fruit on the buffet at all times. The beach was very clean and beautiful. Mario kept the Coronas coming. We didn't have to make a trip to the bar for a refill. I would suggest you buy a insulated cup. They will be happy to fill it with your favorite drink. The cups they have there are only approx. 6 oz. The insulated cup will help keep your drink cold. We booked a swim with the dolphins and absolutely enjoyed it. We saw 1 show during our stay and enjoyed it very much. The entertainment staff likes to involve the audience.

I only found this message board after we arrived home from our vacation because I wanted to make it known to others what a waste of time and money this hotel was to us. We came to this resort fully aware that it wasn't a 5 star, top of the line resort. We knew it was smaller in size, which meant it wouldn't have all of the amenities that the larger hotels would. We knew the food wouldn't be exactly like what we were used to, but we were willing to keep an open mind and try new things. Afterall, this is what traveling to new countries is all about.....However, what we didn't know was how poorly we would be treated while away on a much-needed family vacation. It really is a shame. You spend your hard-earned money on a vacation that you hope your entire family will enjoy, only to receive rude service and be made to feel that we were unwelcome at their hotel. My family did not go thru a travel agent, as I booked this trip on my own. I called 4 weeks in advance to confirm our reservations and again 1 week prior to leaving to be sure they had our reservations set straight. Each time I called they assured me that everything was set and that they looked forward to seeing us there. Boy were they wrong. When we arrived, we lucked out in the game of \"roulette\" (as the other guests referred to it) and we were not bumped to another hotel. However, I had booked 2 rooms and they had only reserved 1 for us. This is not very convenient, especially when you are a family of 6. I was very angry about this and all they could tell me was that the problem would be solved the following day. Wrong again. We received a room with 2 double beds - one for my wife and I, one for my 2 daughters, and my two sons had to sleep on metal cots. Not very comfortable to say the least. The problem wasn't solved the following day, and needless to say we were forced to use the cots another night. The third day, we finally got our second room. What it all comes down to is that the majority of the people working at this resort (I don't want to say all of them because I did not come in contact with every single person there) make it seem as though you are inconveniencing them by being there. I can handle not having a clean, pristine room. Towel animals are far from a priority to me. I can deal with ant problems in the room, it can easily be cleaned up. I can handle 20 or so loud boats in the ocean in front of the beach. I can handle the food not always being up to our expectations, we can make due. But what I can NOT deal with is obnoxious remarks and rude service to me and especially to my family members. My 8 year old daughter slipped and fell by the pool and skinned her knee. Yes, it was her fault that she wasn't careful, but when we asked someone for a bandaid, the woman shook her head and rolled her eyes at us, as if we were pestering her. One night at the buffet it appeared to us and other guests dining around us that the soda was bad. I politely asked a waiter if he could have someone \"check into it when they had time\" and I received a sarcastic remark in return as he muttered under his breath (but loud enough so I could hear) that \"some people are never happy\". There were many more situations like this, but I'm not going to sit here and go into them all. Like I said, it isn't the problems thats we encountered that bothered me. Its the service and the lack of care at this hotel. I'm not expecting people to bend over backwards for me or to wait on me hand and foot. But I would have appreciated an apology, some sort of willingness to help us out, or even a smile once in a while. I have never in my life looked foward to going home while away on vacation.

Do not book here!\u201d", "Author": "weloveplaya", "ReviewID": "UR3573606", "Content": "We just returned yesterday (June 16th) from our 5 day stay at the Reef Coco Beach. Now, before you roll your eyes and think to yourself, \"another negative review, some people are too picky and too hard to please\"... let me tell you this is not our case. We have stayed been to the Riviera Maya area over 10 times. We have stayed many different hotels, from the higher end hotels (Royal Hideaway, Iberostar Lindo, Riu Palace) to the more moderate hotels (Viva Azteca, Riu Playacar, Gran Porto Real) to the small botique style hotels located along 5th Avenue. I am being completely honest when I tell you that this hotel was by far the worst place we have stayed. To me, the size or the star rating of a hotel isn't everything - what it all comes down to is the service. We are not picky people and we understand that accidents happen. If I have an problem in my room, I won't freak out, as long as the hotel staff are apologetic and willing to resolve the problem. That to me, shows they care about their guests and the hotel's reputation. This wasn't the case at the Reef Coco Beach. We booked this hotel because we wanted something small, located near town, and we wanted to try something new. I didn't come across this website until a week before we left for our vacation and by that time it was too late for us to switch our hotel. I was aware of the overbookings and that it might happen to us, but it was still a big disappointment when we walked into the lobby and they pretty much immediately escorted us out to their sister hotel, the Reef Playacar. My husband and I argued against this but they simply had no rooms. At least they were honest, I guess. We had to stay 1 night out of our 4 nights there at the Playacar. The hotel itself wasn't bad, however the construction next door is very disturbing with jackhammering and electric machines causing noise all day. It is very hard to relax when all of this is going on. We packed up our belongings to move back to the RCB the next day and we had to wait quite a while to be shuttled to the resort. They kept saying \"5 more minutes\" which eventually turned into 20. This may have not seemed to be a big deal, but it was cutting into our day and we only had 2 days left to try and enjoy ourselves. We arrived at the RCB and were brought to our room. Now, I understood that this wasn't a 5 star resort and like I said, we had stayed at other hotels in the same price range as the Reef, but the rooms at this hotel are in dire need of an updating. Our ceiling fan didn't work, our mini bar had mold on the inside and wasn't restocked very often, and our bed spread had quite a few rips and tears on it. The bathroom shower was also moldy and they forgot to change the wastebasket from the people before us - dirty baby diapers, not a pleasant surprise. Please believe the reviews when people say the walls are thin, we were kept up one night with a crying baby next door. We only received one towel animal throughout our stay which was somewhat of a disappointment to me. Little touches like this really can add to a guest's satisfaction. Again, I'm not trying to be picky, but come on they could have at least remembered to change the garbage after the inconveniences we had already experienced. We then went down to the pool area. The pool here is very nice. Lots of room. There seemed to be a lot of families but it wasn't overcrowded with kids splashing around. Plenty of room for everyone. We had no problems getting chairs around the pool or a chair at the beach. This was nice because we had experienced problems with this at other resorts. Then we took a walk over to the beach. The water is beautiful, as it always is. Water was very refreshing, very little seaweed. To the north side, there is open beach area because there are no hotels on this side. The locals come here to use the beach and were caught using our hotel's beach chairs and littering their garbage in the sand. This became quite a nuisance. I saw a few people complain and nothing seemed to be done about it. There is a group of about 30 boats which are parked right out in front of the hotel's beach. My husband thought this was an eyesore and said that the ocean smelled of gasoline. He couldn't understand why they had to be right in front of the hotel and not out in front of the uninhabited beach area. Personally, it didn't bother me. It reminded me of the fishing village that this town is known for. If you are looking for a quiet beach, this isn't the place for you as there is constantly boat, jetski, etc activity in the water. We had no problems with the food at this resort. We actually preferred the buffets to the specialty restaurants. MAKE SURE you book your specialty dinners as soon as you get to the resort. We were unable to book right away because we were at the Reef Playacar and were only able to enjoy one specialty dinner. Unfortunately we were given the latest time slot and we missed most of the nightly show. The food did get a little repititious at times, so we had dinner in PDC one night. Sorry to sound so harsh, but the nightly shows were rather lame. The entertainment crew is pretty sad, but I guess I wouldnt' be thrilled to be working at the RCB. I know how poorly some of the staff treated us, I can only imagine how they treat their workers. We saw 2 and decided to skip out on them the other nights and spend our evenings in town shopping and having a few drinks at the local bars. This resort doesn't have any nightlife past 10pm. Even the hotel bar was dead. There is no live music played at this hotel, which we wished there was. At other hotels we stayed at, most of the adults would stay out after the nightly show and have cocktails by the bar and dance or sit and enjoy the live band. This resort is really making a bad name for itself. Most of the staff just don't seem to care. Its really sad because it is leaving many customers upset and angry that their money wasn't well-spent and that they paid to be treated this way. One night when we were out in town we met a couple and got to talking with them. They asked us where we were staying and when we said the Reef Coco Beach, they gave a strange look and all that said was \"oh\". How awful did that make us feel? It seems that this hotel is earning quite a reputation for itself. I could have delt with the minor problems, however I think being shipped off to the other resort set us off on a bad foot. Then when we kept receiving bad attitudes and absolutely no help from the hotel staff, we became very unhappy. Like I said, the hotel staff didn't seem to care about how upset we were that we couldn't spend our entire stay at their hotel. It seemed they were more concerned with getting us out of the hotel before other guests saw what happened. This hotel's management better get its act together because I know many first time visitors won't be returning. Its a shame too because this also reflects on this area of Mexico. I have read quite a few reviews of people saying they would never return to Mexico, or this area because of the bad treatment that they received. This is too bad because I have enjoyed my time at every other hotel we have stayed at, and there are much better resorts out there for the same amount of money as the Reef Coco Beach.

Me and my girlfriend spent 2 weeks here recently and had a fantastic time. Our flight over was 12.5 hours and we got to the hotel about 11.00pm. The staff who greeted us were friendly & polite and the check in was quick. The room was clean with 2 double beds, so one to dump our stuff on and one for us! The air conditioning worked fine and the free mini-bar was well stocked (first thing I did was have an ice cool Modelo!). We had a 3rd floor room which had great views of the beach. The food here was EXCELLENT, I wasn't expecting it to be up to much, but it surpassed all my expectations. There was a different theme in the buffet restaurant every night, and the Chef was always on hand cooking fresh food before you. The buffet food was of a good standard and always hot. Staff were constantly checking the condition of the food. The choice for all meals was generally extremely good. And for those that partyed in the Town centre, you could come back to the late night snack bar for Tostada's, burgers, pizza's etc. Drinks were great! The bar staff worked really hard in the heat, constantly mixing cocktails for people, and were always friendly and polite. In fact, I can't praise the staff highgly enough. All of them were courteous, efficient and very freindly. The only time I DIDN'T see one of them smile, was when a group of American's offered a derisory tip (about $1.5 between 9 of them). I think anyone who has received poor service from staff here must have upset them. All the english people we met there commented how pleasant the staff were. Maybe it's just our polite nature that gets reciprocated??? Maybe there's a lesson there! The hotel itself was spotless! It was constantly being cleaned and I never once saw anything out of place. Further to this, gardeners were cleaning and trimming plants daily, to keep the place looking nice. The beach here was lovely and there were plenty of loungers. A cool breeze kept us a tiny bit cooler in the 90+ heat! Overall this hotel was fantastic, I would strongly recommend this to anyone and already have.

The resort was on the smaller side compared to the other resorts we have stayed at in Playa. We took our 4 year old daughter on this trip and she had a blast. The kiddie pool was just right for her and the larger pool had a walking/sitting ledge. I would recommend bringing an inner tube as they are costly in the gift shop for smaller children. The larger pool is nice as it does not have a deep area--one can walk across the entire area in about chest high water. The pool bar is nice--the bartenders friendly--the drinks are plentiful and top shelf liquors are available. Loungers were always available by the pool and the beach. The boats were moored outside of the swimming area but this did not seem to be a problem for us--there were no gassy fumes as I read in other reviews. Playa was a sleepy fishing village prior to all of the tourism going on there now--so I thought it was kind of cool. It just added to the ambiance. :) The food was disappointing I thought--the selections were not that great and the taste was pretty blah. The snack bar was the old trusty saviour with nachos, pizza & hamburgers & fries. The restaurants that you had to reserve were booked for the early seatings by 9am so we ate late and missed parts of the show. My daughter loved the shows--kind of silly sometimes but entertaining nonetheless. The check-in was no problem whatsoever and the front desk help was very nice. We needed insect repellant as the mosquitos were quite bad while we were there. I have never encountered that problem before but with the spray it was no big deal. The rooms were nice and clean with the exception of ultra mini ants on the counter and ceiling in the restroom of room 2359. Another problem with room was that our mini bar never got restocked as we were promised--even after a call to the front desk. Oh well...I would probably not return to this resort but I can't totally bash it because my daughter had a blast. I prefer the Riu Palace but we booked this trip 3 days prior to leaving and it was full. It is nothing fancy but nice enough. We did get full on the food even though it was not great.

We had some good experiences and some bad ones. We will start with the bad... 1. The front desk people are very shady. Someone in our group lost her room card. When she tried to get it replaced at the front desk, they told her it would be $20 USD. When she went back again, she was told $5 USD and the third time they gave it to her for free. They should have a set price and stick to it. That made us feel like they were going to pocket the money. 2. We were told that since we were the bride and groom we would get upgraded for free to an ocean view room if available. Well, when I first asked, they said none were available. When we went back, still none until my brother-in-law started talking money. They then said they had one, but it would be $25 USD per night. We had to barter with then and got it for $25 a night, but one night free. 3. When my mother and father got to their room, it had two double beds instead of the king as requested. When they went to front desk to change, it was a similar story as the ocean view upgrade. They ended up having to pay to get a room with a king bed. Not cool in my book! 4. The buffet was terrible. I have been to many all inclusive resorts all over Mexico and this was by far the worst. The breakfast was ok, didn't even try lunch, but dinner was terrible. No selection unless you like fruit and coldcuts. I am not that picky and we had a big group of people with us and no one loved the buffet. 5. With our upgrade to the ocean view room, we got lots of other \"extras\". We were on the north side of the hotel. If you can, request something on the south side. The room was great, the view was wonderful, but we were above the kitchen. We had a sick child and heard pots and pans all night and all the noise from the sports bar. I was also woken up a few time with policia sirens because they were busting people on the public beach right below our door. Now for the good... 1. when our child got sick, the concierge desk bent over backwards to help us. The called the doctor for us, they allowed us to call each other and helped with placing the calls. Melina is a doll... she even called me at the hospital to make sure our baby was alright. she was incredible, helpful, genuine and nice. We would have been lost if not for her. 2. The hotel is beautiful. The beach is one of the best I have stayed at in the Riviera Maya. The water was great, big sandy beach with very little rocks. 3. The snack bar, and specialty restaurants were good, but you do have to make your reservations early in the morning. We enjoyed the food and wished we could have eaten there more. 4. The service for the wedding was beautiful. We needed an iron and more towels. They weren't fast, but they got them to us. 5. The staff (except the front desk) was helpful, nice and took care of you. All around it was a good experience. I don't know if I would go back? It was nice, but I have been to nicer for the same price. It was a hard week for us getting married and spending time in the hospital, but the time we did have there was enjoyable and all of our guests enjoyed it too. Just realize that no matter where you go, an all inclusive is hard to do. The food gets old, even if it is good.

The food and drinks are good, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the facilities are nice. For the price, you get exceptional value. What more do people expect?

Myself and my husband have just returned from our holiday at the Reef Coco Beach. We stayed there for 2 weeks from 20th May to 3rd June 2005 and loved every minute of it, we didn't want to come home! The furthest i have travelled is to Egypt which is only a 5 1/2 hour flight from the UK, and this year we decided to push the boat out, and take a 10 1/2 hour flight to Mexico, as we had talked about going to Mexico for years, so we saved all our pennies and wanted this holiday to be one to remember. We travelled with Direct Holidays which seems to be part of the Airtours group as our hotel rep was from Airtours. I had read all of the reviews on this hotel and spent a lot of time on the Internet researching the hotel and looking at pictures and although i was looking forward to our holiday i was dreading arriving as the reviews were not all brilliant. I had visions of having to be moved to their sister hotel which i had also read reviews on and that hotel seemed to be even worse. We arrived after a long flight and our initial thoughts were good. We had no trouble booking in, the Reception staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was lovely. We had room 2263 which was on the first floor and over looked the pool and the beach, and was opposite the restaurants. The hotel has mainly American and Canadian people on Vacation as for most it is only a 2-3 hour flight away most of which were very friendly and all asked where we came from as our accents stood out. There were a few British people there as i think there are 2 or 3 British tour operators from this hotel. The food was fantastic. We had been all inclusive and half board at other hotels in the Medditeranean and North Africa and found the food awful and very repetative, but the food at the Reef Coco Beach was brilliant there was loads to choose from. The waiters and waitresses were brilliant and couldn't do enough for you and we didn't hand out tips left right and centre like we saw some people doing a polite please and a thank you seemed to be more appreciated and a tip nown and again. The speciality restaurants were also very good. We ate twice in the Mexican and once in the Italian. I was a bit worried as me and my husband are in our late twenties and late thirties and to be honest my husband is a jeans man, and doesn,t really wear long trousers, shirts and shoes, he is more of a shorts, t-shirt and trainers man, but he didn't have trouble getting in to the restaurants and he wore long three quarter length shorts/trousers, trainers and a short sleeved shirt and to be honest he looked smarter that a lot of other people that had been allowed in to the restaurant. The rooms were always kept clean and tidy. Our sheets were turned down a few times during our stay with out us asking, we were not used to this service after traveling to the Med. We tipped our maid after 1 week and then again at the end of our stay. There was a mini bar, which was free. Again we have always had to pay extra for a mini bar at other 5 star and all inclusive resorts. It had beer and soft drinks in it and was refilled every two days. The only down fall of the rooms were that the walls were very thin and we could hear peoples coversations, alarm clocks and TV's through the walls. The beach was beautiful, just as i had imagined. White sand and tuquoise waters and was kept very clean. There was always plenty of sun beds to choose from at any time of the day. There were about 30 boats just out side of the swimming area, but they were no problem at all. We were not disappointed. The pool area was nice, but we didn't spend much time round the pool as it seemed a bit full of kids running about and screaming and jumping in and out of the water, and they had the animation activities which were mainly for the kids and as we have no kids the beach was quieter and had a nice sea breeze so we spent most of our free time there. We heard that the night life wasn't great. We didnt go to any of the shows at the hotel in the evenings, and from other English people we were told that we were not missing much. Instead we spent our time, at the lobby bar, the sports bar drinking cocktails, which were great and playing pool and we also went in to the town of Playa del Carmen which was great. Senor Frogs and Carlos and Charlies were good, but very American, not like the sort of entertainment you get in the UK. It's the sort of place you have to be in the partying mood for. It was all audience participation, dancing on chairs etc so if you just like going out for a drink then these are not the places for you. We did about 6 excursions through Airtours which were all excellent and run by Royale Tours. The speed boat and snorkelling trip in Cancun was load of fun. Chitchen Itza was good and our guide was brilliant, but it's a very long, hot day. Xcaret was fantastic. There was load to see and do. Another long and hot day but well worth it. There was load of animals and activities to do. We snorkelled in the under ground river and we also did the Sea Trek at Xcaret which was amazing. It cost $45 each and we walked along the Sea bed with what looks like a astronauts helmet on. We saw the most amazing fish and a Turtle to. It lasted about 30 minutes and was worth every penny, what an experience! We stayed for the show in the evening, it was brilliant and was performed by 300 different mayan people. Tulum and Xel Ha were also good. We spent the morning at Tulum, again very hot but very interesting and the afternoon at Xel ha. Xel ha was an eco parl like Xcaret, but didn't have all of the animals. We had a ticket that was all inclusive, so we could eat and drink as much as we liked all afternoon if we wanted. The food there was great. The snorkelling here was excellant. To top our holiday off we also swam with Dolphins at Dolphin discovery. What an experience i will never forget. There was only 4 people with 2 dolphins and the trainer, so we really got 1 to 1 time with the dolphins.

We were there May 5 through May 15. We were given a choice of rooms and chose 2143. It was ground floor, close to the kids club end of the resort. No view, but we're never in our room anyway, and the convenience was more important to us. It was a nice location, 3 doors down from the breezeway to the pool, on the side of the resort with no restaurants, so it was quiet. We only had one night where we heard some loud folks getting home late-the rest of the time, it was very quiet. We loved the small size, everything was close. It was very clean, the service was good, the food was good, the snack bar was great, the pool was wonderful, the beach was wonderful, the diving was amazing-our best dive ever. We rented a car through the TA on site, painlessly, and went to Chichen Itza. It was only $60 to rent the car, so much cheaper then doing a tour and we were on our own schedule. Long drive. Really cool place except for the two whining children :) They were almost thrown into the sacrificial cenote! I would recommend skipping it if you have kids, we just didn't get to spend any time enjoying it. We'll go alone sometime because it was really neat. We spent a full day Xcaret ,which we love, and all of us swam with the dolphins and went to the night show. I recommend skipping the dinner with the night show as the food for the price was not worth it. Just have dinner before the show and then enjoy the show! The reef staff did dinner on the beach one night which was really neat. We went to the shows almost every night because with the kids, they loved it. Our girls got to be in the Sunday Disney show which was a lot of fun for them. The shows will never make Broadway, but they're entertaining and free :) The animation staff was really great. On the day we dived, we had to leave before the kids club opened and Maria arranged to come to our room early, take the kids to breakfast and then take them to the kids club until we got back. The kids had so much fun they begged us to dive more! We arranged a sitter with guest services one night, a waitress from the restaurant, and she took the kids to dinner and to the show. It was easy on us, and they had a good time. We went to the restaurant in the cave \"Alux\" which was really neat and had great food. Definately recommend it. All the staff were so nice to the kids. Pancho, Maria, Dan and the rest. They were just so nice and friendly. We felt very safe and well taken care of at the resort. The two specialty restaurants were both good, but not much on the menu for the kids. We generally preferred the buffet for the variety for the picky kids to choose from! :) The desserts at the buffet were sinful. Really really good every night. My only complaint about the whole thing would be all the Europeans who smoke! We got so tired of breathing other people's poison! There are no-smoking areas in the restaurant, but they really aren't enforced. I am very spoiled where I live in that smoking isn't allowed in any bar or restaurant so I'm used to fresh air when I dine. A small complaint when compared to the whole trip. We had big insulated drink cups, used them sometimes, but the small ones didn't bother us that much, we never had to wait long for drinks. The bartenders were great. My daughters love to order themselves, and would order their own \"strawberry margarita, no tequila por favor\" And the staff indulged them every time. The liquor was good, top shelf.

I feel I should add my opinion to help those out who are going to stay there. I too read all of the negative reviews before leaving and got quite scared. So I hope this helps. We booked through FunJet, which seems to be one of the best ways to go because instead of getting on a large overcrowded bus from the airport to the hotel, we got a van, which only had 3 other couples going to different resorts-so we arrived at the resort a lot quicker than many other people. Also the Funjet representatives are on location at the hotel (out near the pool area) and they are very helpful. They can book different activities for you-and usually for a better price. My husband and I did the Maroma Beach snorkling/parasailing adventure. This was pretty cool-but not as great as I would have expected it to be. It was my first time snorkling out of the USA-and I expected to see a lot more fish and things. It costed about $90 for both of us. Honestly, we found the best snorkling in Cozumel. If anyone would like to take my advice-listen to this-take a ferry over to Cozumel for the day-rent a car-or we rented a jeep and we just drove around Cozumel for the day. We stopped at Park Chankanaab-wow, this was some awesome snorkling-and if I remember correctly it was less than $20 per person to get in the park (it could be more than that now). It didn't cost anything additional to get into the water to snorkle on your own. There are lots of cool things to see in this park like ancient ruins, and lagoons, also exotic animals. It was really neat. As far the hotel. We decided to upgrade to an ocean front room. It cost $25 extra a day-but we were on our honeymoon-and it was well worth it-it was so beautiful. The first room they gave us overlooked the playground-not where we wanted to be on our honeymoon. The only negative about our room was the air conditioning did not work very good-if at all, and leaked all over the floor-despite constant calls-it was never fixed (hopefully it is now), but we didn't let that ruin our time-as we really were only in our room when we were sleeping. We didn't use the safes in the room-and never had a problem. The beach is beautiful-feels just like you are in some magazine picture you always dream of! We never had a problem finding chairs on the beach or by the pool. It is fun and relaxing to walk along the beach because on one side there is nothing for miles-I thought that was real nice as most resorts are side by side. As far as the food. The snack bar was great. Had a wide variety of foods: pizza, sandwiches, fries, icecream, nachos, etc. The buffet was ok. My husband and I are not picky whatsoever-but we found the buffet food to be ok sometimes and not others-however breakfast at the buffet was always good. You can get omlettes made with whatever you like in them. The chefs are awesome. As far as the 2 specialty restaurants-you do have to make reservations-and depending on how crowded the hotel is you have to make your reservations early. My husband and I ate at both the Italian and the Mexican restaurants. We liked the Italian better. The Mexican was ok-but had a very limited menu. As far as outside the hotel-in town. We went into the town of Playa Del Carmen several times. It (then) cost $3 for a cab ride into town. We went shopping on 5th avenue. If you don't like to be bothered-5th avenue is not for you. There are locals standing outside there shops trying to get you and come in. They won't stop until you do. This didn't really bother my husband and I. When we found something we liked-we told them what we would give them for it-take it or leave it. We ate at Carlos and Charlies in Playa. Good food at reasonable prices. Also we went to Senior Frogs with the entertainment staff at the hotel. Every Friday you can sign up to go-and a big group of people from the hotel get together and go. There is a fee-and if you are not the party type-this is not for you-but my husband and I had a blast there. It was a great time! The hotel really has no night life after 9 p.m.-so the Senior Frog trip was right up our alley! As far as the hotel staff. We found negative and positive aspects of the staff. I mean-there are a lot of people working there-so sometimes it is not the same people every day. We found almost all of the bartenders to be friendly (advice-bring a big mug-there glasses are like 8oz). The entertainment staff were friendly. Only a few of the people at the front desk were helpful. Working in the restaurant business myself-my husband and I did tip the staff members occasionally while we were there. We really didn't notice any different treatment because of this our appreciation for the tip either though. Overall this vacation/honeymoon is one we still talk about every day.

We were there for 10 wonderful days...April 26-May 6. We checked in without any problems. We were concerned after reading several posts here about getting bumped due to over booking, but there was no problem whatsoever. We were given our choice of 3 different rooms. We opted for a room on the 3rd floor (#2347), which overlooked the swim-up bar at the pool, and also had a partial ocean view. The room was very clean with 2 double beds. We would have preferred a king, but it was no big deal. The mattress was on the hard side, but we got used to it. We requested two extra pillows, and they were delivered right away. There is a refrigerator in every room that is stocked every other day with beer, coke, \"light\" coke (diet), and orange soda. Make sure you check the temperature setting if you like your drinks cold. There are also two bottles of water in the bathroom that cost $1 each if you use them. Once they are empty, you can re-fill them at no charge down in the Mirimar (buffet) resturant. The rooms also have a large closet with mirrored doors, and there's plenty of room for your luggage. The dresser space is limited, but there are shelves in the closet if you need them. There is an in-room safe that's an additional $3/day, but it has a digital lock, so you don't have to keep track of a key. You set the combination yourself. The bathroom is nice, and has a hairdryer and seperate make-up mirror. There's quite a bit of counter space for your toiletries, and the maids make the paper products look like fans when they clean the room. We had plenty of towels. We did have to ask for another washcloth once because for some reason, one disappeared. All in all, the room was very nice. One night, we had turn-down service where they made the bed look nice, and put chocolates on our pillows. You can get room service with a limited menu for breakfast or dinner, but we never took advantage ot that. The pool area is great. There's a kiddie pool section that's very shallow, and the entire pool is no more that 4'1\". There is a wall in the pool under the foot bridge that crosses the pool, so don't try to swim under it! There's also a ledge around most of the pool, which is nice to sit on. The swim-up bar is great. Sometimes it took a while to get a drink because at times, there wasn't a bartender assigned to the swim-up side of the bar. You can also access this bar from the pool deck. The beach is awesome! It is definately the best we've ever been on. If you walk north, there is nothing but undeveloped beachfront. We walked it every morning. The locals hang out there some, especially on the weekends. It was fun to watch the kite surfers. The sand is very white and soft, and the water is very clear. The hotel has numerous palapas to sit under. We never had a problem getting one. A previous report said that there weren't beach waiters, but we had several staff people every day that came around to pick up cups, and they would ask if we would like another drink. Many guests used insulated cups of all sizes for refills, and there was never a problem. I would say the glasses the hotel uses are 8-10 ounces, so if you want larger drinks, bring a cup. The activities staff are a great bunch of young people. It is quite a mix of international personnel, and they are very energetic. There are all kinds of things to do from aerobics, to beach volleyball, bocce and more! If you prefer to kick back and relax, go for it! The food was very good. The breakfast buffet has an omlette station, wonderful fresh fruit, and too many other dishes to count. The lunch buffet always has two kinds of soup, lots of salad fixings, and an assortment of hot and cold dishes. We had lunch at the snack bar almost every day. The snack bar was great! You could get burgers, sandwiches, chicken wings, pizza, BBQ chicken, nachos, quesadillas, tostadas, and wonderful ice cream (try the coconut!). The dinner buffet had different \"themes\" every night. Our first night, dinner was served on the beach, which was a huge undertaking by the staff between set-up, serving, and take-down. We were told that they only do it 2X a month. The dinner buffets were good. Most nights there was either grilled or roasted meat, and there was always fresh fish. For several nights for $22/person, you could have a lobster dinner if you ordered it ahead of time. We decided to try it, and it was pretty good. The lobster was a broiled tail (pretty good size), and anything from the buffet. The charges were billed to your room. The a la carte resturants were very good. You need to make a reservation in the morning, but we never had a problem getting one. Men have to wear long pants, but the resturants are air conditioned. My husband preferred the Italian resturant over the Mexican one, but I liked both of them. There are shows every night, but we never went to them, so I really can't comment on them. The night we had dinner on the beach, they staged an elaborate dance show both on the beach and in the water. There are two bars at night. The lobby bar has live music, usually a trumpet or trombone player, which was nice, but the lobby bar can get pretty warm, and there's not much air moving around. We preferred the Sports Bar, which was air conditioned, and there are places to sit on the deck outside to enjoy the night breeze and watch the lights over on Cozumel. The Sport Bar also has a pool table, and numerous TVs to watch various sporting events. The hotel has a salon, but we didn't use it. It also offers massages on the beach. I had a 30 minute massage, and it was heaven! The massages are $30 for a half hour, and $50 for an hour, and it is billed to your room. There is also a small gym with free weights, 2 treadmills, an elliptical cross trainer, and a recumbent bike. There is also a 3 station weight machine as well as both a men's and women's sauna. The gym is air conditioned, but there isn't any staff (this is common at most places). There is a great jewlery store at the hotel. It had alot of nice silver jewlery. There is some gold, but they seemed to specialize in silver. We purchased a couple pieces. When we went to Playa Del Carmen, we checked out some jewlery stores there, and we felt the store at the hotel was better. Just in case you need to call home, there is a phone card phone in the lobby. The phone card machine is right next to the phone. There's also two computers which operate with peso coins in the same area. The rooms also have phones, and if you call to the US or Canada collect, there's no charges for using your room phone. We haven't gotten our home phone bill yet to see how expensive our calls were. The hotel has a car rental kiosk as well as a place to book excursions. We didn't use them, but the prices for excursions are posted so you can check out the prices before you go in to book. We rented a car from an agency near the airport, and parking at the hotel was never a problem. There is also a place the vacation booking companies have representatives to confirm your returning flights, or if you need any help. We were contacted a couple days before we left to remind us to stop by to confirm our shuttle and flight. All in all, we loved the hotel, and would definately go back. We hope to do so next year!", "Date": "May 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cgreat little place\u201d", "Author": "Radek99", "ReviewID": "UR3452586", "Content": "Food was good - buffet had variety (roasted pig, ribs, pasta, mexican stuff, salads etc.), the Italian was very good, avoid the steak at the Mexican but other food was great; the snack bar was always handy with a wide selection grounds are nicely groomed, green and well taken care of pool is clean and quite shallow (deep end is 4 feet I think) with shallow ledge on edges and swim up bar 4 bars - good service and a good variety of drinks - bring your own cup or mug if you like larger drinks service - great from the staff but poor at the front desk (conflicting information - only got our crib on the 4th day and the iron on the second day and had to pay $50 to stay in our room on the last day until 5pm) beach - wide and long (long if you venture onto the public beach which is also as nice) - cleaned every two days since accumulation of weeds is pretty high. boats - this is so silly - 25 boats just beyond the swimming boundry but none to the right or to the left of resort - locals' way of saying \"take this\" to the resort that took their beach away and also the reef protects the boats snorkeling - right there infront of the resort - reef is mostly dead but still nice - other options$$$ available near by. tennis, basketball, watersports, snorkeling, cayaking etc. view from sports bar is great - can see Cozumel on a sunny day.

This was our fifth trip to Mexico (2nd time to Playa Del Carmen) and we will definitely be back. Although the Reef Coco was not the BEST resort we have stayed at, it does rank high among the other hotels we've been to. The Reef Coco is a small resort (just 200 rooms) compared to the mega-resorts we have stayed at. This means that there is less walking distance from your room to the pool, or the restaurant, or the beach, or to anything. On the downside, I rather enjoyed walking the expansive, manicured grounds of the big resorts. But don't get me wrong, the Reef Coco is pretty. Everywhere you look, you want to take a picture. We had read several reviews and were concerned about over-booking and being bumped. But in reality, our check-in went smoothly and we even got the room we requested (on the top floor on the left side is best: not too noisy and away from the kitchen/restaurant). Our room was clean and everything worked (the AC worked TOO well...I was freezing at night and actually had to raise it). The bathroom was clean and the shower had instant hot water. Although they supplied you with bottled water ($1USD each), the hotel ran purified water and I brushed my teeth with just regular tap water and had no problems. Whenever I go on vacation, I tend to over-eat. The Reef Coco is a good place to over-eat. I found the food in the buffet-style restaurant excellent. The choice of entrees are not as overwhelming as the mega-resorts, but the selections are good and there are a lot of fresh vegetables and the sweetest fruits. There are two specialty restaurants, Italian and Mexican. Both were very good, but we enjoyed the buffet better. But go ahead and try the two restaurants, the dining rooms are pretty and have a really nice view of the hotel and the beach. The serving staff is very nice, but there is not enough of them. They can't seem to refill my diet Coke faster than I can drink it. I found it faster just to get up and go to the bar next to the buffet and ask for another drink. The beach is the main reason we go to Cancun and Playa Del Carmen. It's not the hotels, or the food , or the shopping, or the bars. The beaches in Mexico are breathtaking. The sand is clean and almost white-looking in bright sunshine. The water is clear and the colors are unreal. When you see postcards of Cancun beaches with it's aqua-blue waters, that's how it actually looks. The beach at the Reef Coco is nice. It is just a few feet away from the pool area. There were plenty of lounge chairs available and they have built many new palapas for shade. Past reviews had negative comments about the boats parked along the beach. I actually liked looking out and seeing them bobbing up and down. It was like being in some kind of fishing village. If you don't like the boats, just walk down the beach a little and you will see nothing but beautiful sand and sea. The only downside of the beach: nobody brought you drinks, so you had to trek back to the pool bar to get a drink. FOR: Small size means less walking, more intimate setting, not too loud. Great food, clean rooms, friendly staff, very close to town/shopping, nice beach AGAINST: Not enough serving staff in restaurant, no drink service at the beach, nightly entertainment show was lame, the whole resort was quiet by 10pm (this could be a good thing if you are not a night person). In Conclusion: Although not the best resort we have stayed in, we definitely enjoyed our time at the Reef Coco. The food was good and more importantly, we did not get sick. The staff was very nice. The room was clean and the AC worked. This resort was well worth the budget price.", "Date": "May 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roseville, Ca", "Title": "\u201c10 Gals from California Loved the Reef Coco Beach\u201d", "Author": "lofdol", "ReviewID": "UR3449768", "Content": "I just returned from a week at the Reef Coco Beach with 9 gal pals (ranging in age from high 30s to low 60s) and we all had a great time. Read the horrible review from Canada the evening before we left so we were all a bit apprehensive. We were on a complimentary trip for being bumped last year (to the RIU Palace Las Americas in Cancun) so were afraid that the same might again happen. I e-mailed the hotel before we left and was assured that our rooms would be available. Check-in was great and rooms were all very close together. This is my 4th trip to the Mayan Riviera and I love it more every time. My last stay was at the RIU Palace in Playacar which is awesome. The Reef Coco Beach is smaller and not as fancy however a good time was had by all. Not all of the employees speak English but here's a new flash....\u201dwe are in their country\u201d.....try and speak their language. We never had any difficulty getting what we needed and they all went out of their way to please us. Oscar in the travel agency is awesome and will assist you in anything you need. He even made dinner reservations at Alux..(the cave restaurant) for us. Yes, there are some boats in front of the resort (maybe 15 or 20..) but they add character to the view and if you don't like them, walk 100 yards down the beautiful beach and sit there. We swam in the ocean everyday and not one of us was hit by a wave runner nor passed out from gasoline fumes. We ate at the specialty restaurants 3 nights (no problem at all securing reservations) and loved them every time. Having 10 in our party, we were able to try almost everything on the menu. The guest rooms are not the largest but they are clean and the air conditioning works great. We all were on the 2nd floor overlooking the pool between the lobby and the beach. The grounds are beautiful and kept very clean. The shows are cheesy but I give them an A for effort. We all took huge mugs which were happily filled for us with anything we desired. Playa del Carmen is a charming town and a short walk down the beach. The vendors do get a little pushy at times but a simple \"No Gracias\" always stops the sales pitch. We went to the sister hotel (Reef Playacar) but were told they no longer have exchange privileges. We had to get a little forceful and they finally agreed to honor our wristbands. The grounds at the Playacar resort are pretty (very green and tropical) but we all preferred the newer and smaller resort at Coco Beach.

I don't know where all the bad reviews come from, we were travelling in a large group and all had a great time. No problem with overbooking/bumping. We needed 5 rooms, arrived at different times and all received rooms immediately upon arrival. We did email the hotel beforehand to confirm our reservations. One family requested a room change after the first night and by 12 were in a new room. All rooms clean and very quiet, except for noisy guests returning at night!! Rooms were cleaned daily and turn down service for our room about 4 of the 7 nights we were there. But that did not bother me or my family when our sheets were not turned down. We don't do it at home so it doesn't make a difference when traveling. Hotel looked great, very clean, people constantly cleaning up around pool, garbarge, ash trays, food, glasses, etc. Restrooms were clean and had no problems with any of the public restrooms. We had lots of kids using all the bathrooms and had no problems with any of them. Staff was very nice and pleasant, front desk staff spoke very little or no English. But we didn't really deal with them so not much of a problem. Melina at the front was a big help in making arrangements. No problem getting reservations at the Italian or Mexican restaurants. Buffet was good for breakfast and lunch. The adults thought it was fine for dinner but the kids were looking more for chicken nugget, burgers and pizza, which they don't have at the buffet. The snack bar at the pool was great, excellent service. The kids loved Medel, very friendly and knew exactly what all the kids wanted, since they all went up every hour!!! I think our group of kids ate all the wing dings and cheese pizza they had that week. All the families loved the U shape of the hotel. Very safe for the kids to go anywhere, we loved it as a family resort. Could see the kids from anywhere. No problem with the boats in front, there are about 15 boats out there during the day. The wave runners and kayaks are not allowed in the swimming area, our group did both a couple of times during the week. So if swimmers were worried about getting run over by a waverunner they were not in the right area. Which is clearly marked with ropes. The beach was clean, never saw anybody but hotel guests using the beach chairs. The kids club was great, it was a nice break from the sun for a while. Kids would go in and out all day. All in all it was a great vacation and would not hesitate to go back with a family. If you are looking for a romantic vacation I'm sure there are better hotels.

Every Hotel in the area over books and either bumps you to another Hotel before you arrive, asks you to move before checking you in and then puts notes on your door looking for volunteers to move while you are a guest. I heard this from so many people in so many hotels in the area. You have only a 50% chance of actually staying at the \u201cAll Inclusive\u201d hotel you booked. But lets concentrate on The Reef Coco Beach. 5 star\u2026NO ! As a hotel, they are a 2 Star at most. As an All Inclusive hotel, 1 Star but that should be taken away too. 2 years old and it looks 10. Worn out room d\u00e9cor, tables in the restaurant, chipped glass wear, cold coffee even when fresh. Really limited seating in the specialty restaurants and dirty beach and just overall lazy staff and poor service. Check In; Upon my arrival, I was asked if I would like to move, since we had friends already checked in, we said no. Then we were asked to pretend we were getting bumped so the other 3 families in the lobby that got bumped would not get any angrier. We played along and finally got our room 30 minutes later. Room: For a hotel only 2 years old, it looks bad. Rusted lamp shades, loud toilettes (which I had to fix myself, not a big deal but I should not have had to do it the same night we checked in) leaking mini bar (water everywhere when we opened our door for the first time, I asked the staff to mop it up and when they looked at the mini bar asked me if I wanted more beer!), ants on the bathroom counters, dull paint and not all the light switches worked? Nice King size bed but very hard. Not a problem when you have been drinking! Walls are paper-thin which is real nice when the Senor Frog tours gets back at 2 or 3 am, loud and drunk or when the room beside you watches TV all night long thinking they are drowning out their passion. The hotel is in a horseshoe shape so all noises echo around the complex. Pool: It seems they clean it 2 days in a row, then not for 2. Seems to be a 2 on 2 off system or every third and fourth day they get a monkey to do it! No maintenance during the day at all. God forbid they monitored it. Even the busiest bathroom in the place, next to the pool has no service during the day. It stinks and garbage everwhere. Lots of tanning chairs, room for every one. Just go back to your room to use the washrooms. Beach: Warm and beautiful. But unlike the pictures, 120 boats block the view to the ocean. They stay there because there is a small reef that helps shelter them from the large waves. Love the smell and taste of gasoline when swimming? The locals who use to use the beach that is now The Reef Coco beach are not happy and love to pop by to use the chairs, bring their groceries and let you know YOU took their beach. The garbage in the sand is disgusting from both by locals and hotel guests. Just poor out your drinks anywhere and stick your cigarette butts in the sand when finished. A quick snorkel from the beach and you can see the crap on the ocean bottom, but don\u2019t keep your head down too long or you will get run over by a boat or a wave runner. Staff: except for the odd really good bartender and the staff in the specialty restaurant, they are slow and no English. 5 minutes to get and extra towel from the cleaning staff and I was good at charades and pictionary! One good thing, we left the safe open and everything there but nothing touched while we were at the bar and the bed was being turned down and chocolate on the pillow. The bed turn down happened 3 times out of 6 nights. Our friends got it once. There is no pride in the quality of their work. They are there to do what they are told and then not do what they should. Assuming ofcourse there is leadership somewhere in that hotel. Playa Del Carmen: Nice little shops. 600 and they all look the same! Constantly asking you to come in, special prices etc etc. Do not wear a shirt that says where you are from or marking of anykind. They will call you that at every corner. Hey Canada, come see my treasures, speacial prices for Canadians, can I buy your shirt, want to trade, Ah you are from canada, very cold there, here we have very hot prices, speacial just for you. Nice to hear that 600 times an hour. They think acting like morons will entice you into their shop! They will negotiate but no more than $1-$2 on items over $10. Do not count on $10-$20 off per hundred. They are not that reasonable. Walk up and down 5th avenue twice and you too will be ready to punch the sales guys from the Mayan Palace that want you to see their Condo or play golf! They have a booth at every corner and 2-3 people per booth. Even the restaurants employees are a pain in the ass to try to get you into their restaurant! So, Overall, I would not only avoid The Reef Coco beach but also advise others not to waste their time and money. It was really disappointing.

Everything you need is right in front of you. No more than a five minute walk about anywhere. Can upgrade to an ocean view for $25 extra per night. We were glad that we didnt because there is great people watching from your balcony when you just want to hang out. Many ocean view rooms. Stayed in 2357, nice pool view with beautiful ocean views across from all the restaurants/sports bar. I highly recommend asking for a room on the top floor across from the restaurants/bars. Very peaceful and quiet with great views. Breakfast and Lunch at the grill were very good. Dinner buffet was typical. Got old fast but but you can get reservations at the italian and mexican specialty restaurants. And their is always good eating in town for a night or 2. Service was average sometimes questionable. We enjoy to tip for drinks/ food (because we know that Euros wont) and the service seemed to be the same if you tipped or not. A couple of people stood out as very helpful but overall it was average service. Corona and negra modella on tap (at the bars) with modella especial,coke,fanta,and coke light in the minibar in your room. Liqour selection was good with Absolut,Baileys,Bacardi,Jack,Grand Marnier,Appletons etc. They are supposed to refill your minibar every other day but if you leave the housekeepers a couple of bucks everyday they will fill it everyday. They have turndown service nightly. Massages were $30 for a half hour and well worth it. Reef marina will help you if you are paying for a service (waverunners,parasailing,tours,etc.) If you want to use something that is part of the all-inclusive they really dont care. The whole area is mostly Euro which means unattractive topless hairy women, no tipping and rudeness. But we all know their reputation. Like the reputation for us Americans being loud and rude (which i never seen on many trips to beach destinations.

This year we had 4 other couples with us, and I wish to share with you our experience. Once again this year we found the resort to be clean and comfortable, although found alot of noise this year which really took away from the tranquility we remember from last year. Alot of families with small children now travel to this resort (and hey why not, its small and really easy to get around and likely an ideal place for families with children), however, we are now of an age we prefer to get a break from that. Maybe will review adults only the next time. The food is good. Whether in one of the two A la Carte restaurants (both really good, we did prefer the Italian though) or the buffet, if you go hungry here well then my friend the problem is yours. A very large variety of foods and always something to please the palet. Warning,,,the buffet is very noisy during dinner hours and if you want reservations in one of the two A la Carte restaurants they start taking reservations at 7:00 a.m. the morning of, at the buffet restaurant. Go early to ensure you get what you want. There are no limits on how often you eat there and is extremely good service and nice to be pampered. There were alot more Palapas on the beach this year which was certainly a welcomed change. Some large square ones (One which became our little hang-out for two weeks) which will comfortably shade 8 people on the loungers. Again get up early to ensure you get your desired spot. The staff once again will go out of their way to please. No complaints here. Actually feel as though we have made some new friends. Did notice the tipping was expected more this year but not a problem for us as we always have. Good idea to tip the waiter on the beach especially. He'll ensure you get non-stop service if going to the bar is a problem when you'd rather be sun bathing. There is a photographer that comes around three times a week. Once with Parrots, once with an iguana, and another time with a little monkey. We got photos of ourselves and the parrots last year, this year the iguana. Nice shots and he will take other shots for you if you wish. Lots of excursion trips if you wish. There is an office for bookings in the main lobby and of course your travel rep can arrange for anything you'd like to do. We shopped around a bit and got better prices before going back to our rep and got a better deal. There is a serious problem here with overbooking. We heard far too many times of people who had gotten bumped to another hotel as the Reef had overbooked. SCARRY! Thankfully this didn't happen to us. We were 5 couples this year and none of us had the misfortune. We booked our return visit to Reef Coco Beach last August (2004) and had been emailing the resort and making requests for certain rooms for the 8 months prior to our arrival. We thought this would give enough notice. IT DIDN\"T. We understand you get busy etc, however one would think we had given lots of notice. We were a little disappointed but got the room we wanted the second week of our stay so felt better then. All in all we had a great time and would recommend this resort to those who enjoy The Mayan Riviera, especially the village of Playa del Carmen. The resort is clean, small and easy to get around in, the food and service is good and have difficulty believing someone would actually be disappointed here. We are going to look at something different next time for a change though.

The boats in the water, right outside of the hotel were a little bothersome - I didn't really like swimming right there....but you could walk a very short distance and be away from the boats. We spent most of our time at the pool. It was our first time at an all-inclusive and our boys (12 and 17) definately liked being able to eat and drink whenever they wanted. The food, while not fantastic was definately acceptable to our family. We ate at the buffet twice for dinner and at both the Mexican and Italian restaurants. The buffet included some cooked-to-order items...omlets at breakfast, shrimp and pasta at dinner. I would recommend bringing your own insulated mugs - as suggested on other reviews. We did and it was great for keeping drinks cold, plus they didn't really seem to wash their own glasses that throughly.

The first week you did not have to book the ala carte restaurants at 6:30 in the morning, we had no problem booking a reservation for 15 at 9:30 AM, but the second week was busy and there seemed to be the same people every day in line to book the restaurants at 6 in the morning. These are the same people who put towels across 6 chairs and don't show up until 11AM. We were always able to get a chair or a dinner reservation though, the staff was great. I found a few of the Americans very RUDE and felt sorry at times for the staff. There were 3 teenagers laughing at a person taking food orders because they couldn't understand english that well. To be fair to the Americans reading this review.... most of you are fine but there are a few who need lessons in politeness and courtesy. This resort is Mexican owned and they do a great job. It was very clean. I will definately be back. The location is great. It's walking distance to town, even for our 6 & 7 year olds. If you are going to the Playa area visiting 5th avenue at night is a must. It's cooler for the kids and a great atmosphere at night. The town seems to come alive. Friends of ours have stayed at the bigger 5 star resorts and although you may have more variety of food you are not within walking distance to town and you have to walk too far to your pool, beach or restaurants. At the Reef you can let you kids have a little more freedom without fear of them getting lost. We went snorkling just in front of the Reef Marina and it was good, but you have to take a boat for the great snorkling. A good day trip for families is over to Cozomel and a short cab ride to Chuckanabb Park... Great Snorkling without the cost. No problem with overbooking...it was one of my concerns before we went so I e-mailed the hotel and they quickly confirmed all 15 of our reservations. When speaking with our vacation representative she said that they very very rarely get bumped, if there is a case of overbooking the small booker or the online booker (someone who doesn't book alot) are the one who get bumped. Tips at the hotel are not expected, which I found to be nice, but are appreciated. **TIP - you don't have to pay the 3.00/day for the safe in your room... just use the access code 5 6 7 8 , then set your own code. leave the safe open when you leave. **", "Date": "April 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Keota, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cIncredible place!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3338221", "Content": "This all-inclusive resort is INCREDIBLE!

We did talk to some people who had gotten bumped to the other resort, so I recommend being diligent about confirming your reservation. The hotel was always immaculate - including the rooms, grounds and pool. The beach was terrific - and extends as far north as you can see because the property borders a public beach. We were hoping to do a lot of snorkeling, but discovered that there really isn't a lot of outstanding snorkeling near the resort. There are snorkel tours you can take for an extra charge through the hotel, but we recommend going into town and booking a tour through Tank-Ha diving center. (For $30 US dollars you get a 3 hour trip, versus $25 for a 45 minute trip through the hotel's dive center). Otherwise, if you want to do a lot of snorkeling right from your hotel, perhaps you should choose a hotel in a different location. If you are traveling with children, this hotel would be great for you. There are facilities set up just for kids - both inside and out - and there are staff available to entertain the children as well. Also, the layout of the hotel is small with the pool in the center of everything, and conducive to keeping an eye on busy children. We have to agree with other reviews about the food being a disappointment. The two restaurants had great soup and we liked our entrees, but the cafeteria wasn't very good. We ended up eating a lot at the snack bar which had some tasty food.

The restaurants never seem to be overcrowed and we never found trouble getting a table for 6 at any mealtime. The best things about the A la carte restaurants were the coconut shrimp in the Mexican restaurant. The Buffet had theme nights every day and it added a lot of variety to the types of food. The staff are all very friendly and the activity staff mix and visit with the guests , they come from many different countries in North and South America and Europe. They have very interesting stories to tell. The proximity of this resort to Playa Del Carmen is excellent, 20 minute walk down the road or on the beach or a $3 cab ride if you have too much to carry home after shopping on Fifth Avenue.

Despite having concerns about the overbooking problems read about on other reviews, our check-in was smooth, courteous and problem-free and turned out to be just the beginning of warm, friendly service. Our room had 2 beds, which are true double beds and NOT queensize, which was about the only *negative* aspect for us. However, it was immaculately clean and was refreshed each evening with towels, bed turndown service and chocolates on the pillows. The beach is wonderful--powdery white sand, lots of thatch-covered sunshades and a multitude of lounge chairs, and just a step away from the pool. We were on the all-inclusive plan, so water activities (kayaks, etc.) were free of charge. Pool activities at various times throughout the day varied from exercising to tequila water volleyball (you mess up, you drink a shot!), and there's always a restaurant or other food service available if you have room for another bite. We found the large buffet restaurant's food to be plentiful and fresh, if a little ordinary... but enough variety to keep from being bored. The 2 \"special\" restaurants were good but harder to get into unless booked fairly early each day. The sports bar (on the same level as the special restaurants) has a pool table; for some reason, it was almost always empty. I think it was just undiscovered since the lobby and pool bars are right in your face all the time. It's a great place for a drink, some music, dynamite ocean views, and a terrace seating area if you want open air instead of lounge atmosphere. Our trip was privately booked, so we did not have a voucher for van or taxi transportation from the airport to the resort. The posted airport-resort taxi price is over $65 (we negotiated at $55); the resort-airport price was $45.

Before going to the Reef Coco Beach, I had read that their overbooking problem is particularly bad and it caused unnecessary worry when we should have simply been able to look forward to our holiday. I telephoned the hotel directly three times to try and get them to confirm my booking, but I wasn't convinced. So, I visited the owner's website, Reef Resorts (I think there's a link to it from the Reef Coco Beach website) and I emailed them directly. The response I received from Reef Resorts indicated that they were panicking slightly that more and more people are realising their bad practice of overbooking the hotel. They assured me in writing, on their email reply, that I would be staying at the Reef Coco Beach, so I made sure I printed that off and took it with me. As it turned out, the management at Reef Resorts had also sent my email to the Reef Coco Beach, and when we arrived our reservation was separate from the others, and we were given gold wrists bands rather than the standard ones (I didn't care about the colour of the wrist band, but obviously someone had thought \"we'd better not shuttle this couple to the other hotel as they've been in touch with head office\"). Unbelievably, another couple who'd arrived on the MyTravel flight with us and travelled to the hotel in the same transport, got sent to the sister property! I did enjoy the Reef Coco Beach. I particularly enjoyed the ala carte restaurants in the evening, and you simply book into these in the morning before breakfast. If you do this around 8am you will be fine. The hotel itself is lovely - really well looked after - and the beach is pretty spectacular. It's a shame the sunbeds are packed in quite tightly but having said this you could easily carry them to a more secluded part of the beach. Despite our great week at the hotel, I would not book it again simply because the pleasure of looking forward to the holiday was taken away by concerns we would get moved to the inferior property, and I had to spend time on phone calls and emails that normally I wouldn't have to make.

I would like to begin by saying that we had researched this resort and read reviews before chosing it and we believe that your time there is what you make of it. Some of the reviews we read were not great but we took a chance and did not regret it. Upon arriving in Cancun there was a van waiting to take us directly to the resort rather than having to take a bus and stopping at many resorts on the way. We were told that it would be two hours before many of those people reached their resorts but we arrived in about 20 minutes. The resort is very beautiful and quite impressive. When trying to check in we were told that there would be a wait because they were trying to get another couple to go to the sister resort, Playacar, and didn't want this couple to know that we had rooms. Because of the wait and trouble we experienced we were able to negotiate an ocean-front room (#2365) in a quiet location for a small \"donation\". It was well worth it. Our room was very clean (cleaned twice a day), spacious, quiet, and the view from our wrap around deck (facing ocean-front and south of the resort) was breathtaking! The food at the buffet was average but not a large variety. The Italian and Mexican restaurants were good, desserts were awesome. We ate mostly at the pool restaurant where they had nachos with guacamole, roasted chicken, ribs, pizza, burgers, and a variety of sandwiches. We enjoyed the waffle fries with cheese and the coconut icecream was awesome! By the end of our week we ended up going into Playa Del Carmen to try some of the restaurants there to have something different. Although our checkin was slow the staff was friendly and apologetic. There were some language barriers (didn't know what a pillow was) but most staff members could speak english fairly well. As for bartenders, the sports bar was great (Pedro was hilarious), the lounge bar was good, the buffet bar was okay, and the swim-up bar was very slow but whereever you were the drinks were good. Best part of this resort is its beach! The sand is beautiful white powder and is kept very clean. There are always lots of chairs and the water was very warm. To the north there are no other resorts and you can walk a long time undisturbed and without worry. Do not be surprised to see women tanning topless as this is very common on the beach area. My favorite beach experience was an hour long massage - wonderful and extremely relaxing! All in all it was a great holiday. We met some wonderful people that added to the excitement of our trip.

We were fortunate to have stayed their six of our planned eight nights. We booked through Expedia and we were told of \"an unfortunate circumstance\" when we arrived, that the hotel had been overbooked and that they would have to move us to their other hotel in Playacar as there was no room at the inn. We were taken aside and offered a free safe for the duration of our stay. We said no and they came back with either a snorkel trip or a massage as compensation for our troubles. Our alternative was to leave and find another hotel on our own. Backed into this corner with an upset wife and anxious 9 year old we took the offer and moved to Playacar for two nights and a day. After finally getting into the resort and meeting some of the people there it is apparent that they routinely overbook the Coca Beach location and dump the overflow at their other resort in Playacar which apparently hasn't had a problem with availability. I would estimate 50% - 75% of the people we spoke to had a similar experience upon check-in. Even though the rooms are all \"run of the house\" I met one guest that got a beach front room when he laid $100/day additional cash on the counter at check-in. The management (as well as the rest of Mexico) is on the take. Cash talks down there! The Playacar location is much older and has lots of nice vegetation on the grounds. However, it smells old and the place needs a face lift of which they were in the process of re-doing the walkways at the time we were there. They also do NOT heat the pool beyond probably 72 degrees. Even the activities people were hesitent to enter the pool because it was soo cold. This place is \"tired\" and due to the most recent hurricane season the beach is mostly gone. You cannot walk one way down the beach because it is gone! There is also alot of construction going on next to the resort. The sound of a couple of jack hammers was present with the exception of Sunday. they appear to be building a pool at the time we were there. Perhaps they will be done by the time you arrive. The Coca Beach location is nicer for two reasons; it is only about five years old and it has an intact beach. It is deficient in vegetation but for the tall palms that they moved to the location, principally around the eating area at the pool. The hotel itself is equivalent to a nice motel 6 with a grass roof facade, it does have a nice big pool which is heated reasonably well and the beach is great. There is a reef for snorkeling just beyond the boat anchorage in front of the hotel but, beware when the wind is blowing there is a strong current between the beach and the reef. The week in the sun was enjoyable but, the biggest disapointment was the attitude of the front desk management. I don't know if they were all looking for bribes when we checked in but their \"take it or leave it\" attitude is frustrating after a day of travel and months of anticipation. For these reasons I will not go to either of these location again. If you would like to go for a trip where you feel you are treated like a king I suggest the Gran Puerto Real in Playa de Carmen. It is within walking distance of 5th avenue and if you avoid the time share solicitation, you will enjoy your time at this 5 Star hotel. The Coca Beach does not even compare to the Gran Puerto Real. If we go back to this area again it will be at the Gran Puerto Real and NOT Coca Beach.

We researched quite a bit and decided on booking Coco Beach b/c it was that much nicer than the Playacar. We had heard rumors of overbooking, so had called into Expedia three times, including the night before departure, to triple confirm we were all set at Coco and not going to bump to Playacar. We had also called hotel and they could not really confirm anything since we booked through expedia. Sure enough, we arrived Friday afternoon for a three night stay, and after signing some paper and checking in, we were then explained the situation- which was overbooking. We spent over an hour of wasted time and stress speaking with the hotel manager, who was not helpful and told us either we stay at the Playacar or find another hotel- however pointed out that all hotels in Playa Del Carmen to Cancun were all booked (so basically- good luck!). We had to stay two nights (out of our mere 3 night stay) at Playacar- which had no beach at all- i have pics of sandbags to prove it-;construction on both sides of property, so the noise was relentless all day long during the weekend and have pics of the ugly green wall that surrounds the grounds and blocks the afternoon sun; the gym is an outdoor shack on the beach w/equipment older than the mayan ruins- not even a treadmil or any electric equipment; bikes we could use had flat tires, rusty and/or no handle brakes; our room was ground floor/basement level and b/c of jungle like grounds/atmospher could not even use our small patio w/the one ugly white plastic chair b/c soo buggy and dark there- could not even see the sun or any ocean at all. As another writer said about this hotel- if we had wanted to stay at Playacar we would have booked it. They moved us to Coco beach on Sunday, which once we got there was both relief and then more anger b/c we could see what we missed out on the two other nights. Beach here so much nicer- could actually take a walk and so much more room for chairs and people to sit actually on the beach and/or by the pool. Food was so much better and grounds were bright and sunny. Our room there had a hammock outside on our deck/porch. The whole experience just really ruined our trip, especially since we did a long weekend getaway. Our begging and pleading with the hotel manager got us no where either. Also be aware that Expedia nor the hotel would even provide any refund. We were credited some money back in hotel cost from Playacar vs Coco Beach,but not enough and nor does not make up for all the stress, displeasure and disruption we experienced b/c of being downgraded/bumped. This is not just hotels fault- Expedia is very much also to blame as they gauranteed our room at Coco- in writing on receipt of booking and when we called three times to them. Apparently the hotel manager at Coco told us that their policy is no room gaurantee if payment has not been received- which made me aware that although Expedia charged us right away, they had not yet paid hotel since they pay after services/stay is complete or after we confirm to check in. Sooooo....I would not book through Expedia as this proves they have no pull at all and also don't back up what the claim and don't trust that your reservation at Coco beach is ever really there. If it does work out for you, then I'm sure you'll have a great time since the other non management staff was very friendly and activies people fun and lots to do.

From other hotels that we have been to it is certainly not a 5 star as previously advertised and MAYBE a 4 star. Still it was nice, the rooms were average (I've seen better at 4 stars) but the food was a bit better than we've tried at other places. The italian restaurant was very good and is always booked. The best thing about this resort was the beach and the close proximity to Playa del Carmen. There are some great restaurants in this town, and the ferry to Cozumel is 2$. If you're going to do a snorkel excursion in Cozumel I would suggest just taking the ferry across and booking one when you get off because the hotels rip you off. There's a reef off the reef coco beach was is pretty cool for snorkeling also. We didn't have a problem getting our room but we did see some people who did not have their room the first night and were pretty upset. If you're a light sleeper this hotel is not for you. You can hear EVERYTHING. The staff were extremely friendly, except for Manuel at the desk who didn't seem to care, and was extremely rude. If you need something go to the desk in the evening Liza is very helpful. Also you have to pay for the room safe ( I have never seen an all inclusive hotel ask their guests to pay for a safe) and it is 3$ a day US. Ours was broken so they gave us a safety deposit box at the front. Also paying for the bottled water is equally stupid. Besides these minor aggrevations the place was very nice. We're used to larger hotels but I think we will try to book a small one like this next time.

The weather was fantastic and my opinion is that this is the nicest beach on the Riviera. Plenty of beach & pool chairs and the food was excellent the first 3 days and went downhill from there. On Tuesday the food bars were luke warm and the selection, although much variety, were the same everyday. The grill offered something new for dinner but very limited and quite a line by Wednesday. The drinks were all premium alcohol but served in plastic glasses which did not impress me. I tipped heavily the first 3 days but did not receive any service to speak of so I stopped tipping and had the same service. No coffee pots in the room and the 1st coffee available is 6:30AM. Average age of the guests appeared to be 60+. Good mix of Americans & Europeans. Very pleasant walk along the beach into town (I would estimate about 2 miles each way about 35 min.) Goods in town were priced American even after heavy bargaining but that part was fun sport. Drinks and food in town quite expensive ($7-8 for a Margarita) My greatest disappointment in the food at the resort was the lack of fish (afterall, this is {or was}a fishing village). We have been going to the Yucatan for 20 yrs beginning in Isla Mujeras and then to Playa and beyond. Much too commercialized for me to consider going there on next vacation. The resort was spotless and there was much pride in the housekeeping staff and the desk was very friendly upon our arrival. We were in a pool side room and requested an upgrade to oceanfront. They charged us $150US for the week to change rooms. It was worth it to us. Be aware that there are not many ocean facing rooms. Beds were comfortable, hotwater plentiful during daylight hours...early morning only netted cold showers but we learned that by letting the water run for 10-15 min would make it tolerable at 5am. We usually just came back to the room around 10 and had no problem with hot water. I think that all inclusive just isn't my cup of tea. Not a heavy drinker...maybe 3-4 drinks a day...and all you can eat wasn't a plus for me as I would have been just as happy with 2 quality meals a day. The restaraunts were okay but didn't ring of celebration, the bars were out of the way to get to for evening entertainment. I'd be happy to stay at the reef at coco beach again if I could just do it for the room and beach and not the food and alcohol. Variety COULD be the spice of your vacation.

The only thing we found fault with was that each floor staff did all duties (which included cleaning tables, setting tables, providing drinks, etc.). This led to a few problems in trying to obtain a cup of coffee in the morning. A good feature about the buffet restaurant in the evening was that casual dress was allowed. The snack bar was ideal for lunch and the food variety excelled. The specialty restaurants (Italian and Mexican) were very good with respect to quality, variety and service.

They wouldn't participate. Most days they just skipped events like water polo, basketball, or bingo. One of the ladies totally ripped a swimsuit pocket of a man guarding the goal. All she said was, \"Oh well. Do not mess with a Venezualen woman.\" No offer of compensation at all. The shows were usually pretty good in the evening and the casino night was fun. Many of my drinks were not mixed correctly. They used too much triple sec and they burned alot of drinks with too much tequilla. They ran out of top shelf amoretto in the lobby bar and sports bar, but never replaced them. Some of the top shelf liquor is not even available at the pool bar. Absolute vodka is one example. It seemed like it was a burden to ask for a drink at the pool bar. None of the employees seemed too excited about being there even if you tipped. Overall, I would never rate this hotel as a 4 or 5.

We had a lovely, relaxing time and as many previous reviews have suggested, the hotel is small but this adds to the atmosphere and you don't feel like you're lost in some huge resort. Highlights were the beach, lovely clear sea (I don't get the complaints about the boats, it is, after all, the sea), and the way we were looked after by the majority of the staff, particularly in the ala carte restaurants and at reception. Whilst the food is not five star, it is always fresh. I really enjoyed the food in the ala cartes. They do try really hard with presentation etc and we certainly did not pay five star prices for our holiday so didn't go expecting five star food. My only negative comment would be the overbooking. Whilst this didn't happen to us it happened to others arriving that week and this practice is unacceptable and must be quite upsetting. I saw the Reef Playacar, the sister hotel where the majority of overbooked guests end up, and it's not a patch on the Coco Beach, so no wonder people complain if they're shuttled to the Playacar! I understand the hotel is working hard to overcome these issues though. Reading some reviews I get the feeling that some people thrive on going on holiday simply to complain, so if you're heading to the Coco Beach please don't take the bad reviews to heart - I would go with the overall view that it's good value for money and a lovely resort.

We are both in our early 30\u2019s and were using this trip to find a venue for our wedding next year. Despite concluding that Reef Coco Beach was not really suited for our wedding, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would likely return in the future. If you are looking for an intimate, newer hotel on one of the nicest beaches in the region, this place is for you. For those of you who expect to see elaborate ice sculptures at every meal, flawless service at all times, and staff with fluent English catering to your every need \u2013 go to a more expensive resort. Here is a list of some of the positives and negatives about Reef Coco Beach: POSITIVES (+): Best Beach! \u2013 We looked around at quite a few hotels and determined that The Reef had the best beach by far. By \u2018best\u201d we mean the softest, whitest sand (groomed/cleaned regularly). It also had very little rock and nearly a mile of undeveloped beach on the north side \u2013 hardly a sole to be found. Some found the boats floating in front of the beach to be an eyesore. Have a look at our photos from the link below and judge for yourself. Great Pool/Hotel Layout: - The pool (as seen on the photos we\u2019ve linked to) weaves through the hotel grounds and is nicely lit during the evening. Great layout! When we were there, the resort was 100% full and there were still plenty of chairs around the pool to be found. The pool was nice and cool and the swim-up bar was great. Forget something in your room? No problem! Everything is within a 3-minute walk \u2013 if that! Good Food: - I love seafood, and I was not disappointed. One night at the buffet I helped myself to a heaping plate of giant prawns. The chef cooked them in garlic and butter right before my eyes. The two main restaurants were great as well, although we preferred the Italian over the Mexican. Location, Location, Location: Although the resort is set back quite nicely from any other over-crowded beach resorts, The Reef is only a $3.00 cab ride from Playa Del Carmen \u2013 one of the nicest towns (especially at night) we have ever been to, and much nicer than Cozumel. Liquor \u2013 All premium brands \u2013 anytime, anywhere. Clean/Safe \u2013 The resort and rooms were always kept immaculate. The staff worked very hard and was attentive to your needs. We ate all food and drank the water \u2013 were never sick \u2013 nor was anybody else we ran into. We never once felt unsafe or felt that we had to worry about someone stealing our possessions. NEGATIVES (-) (Quite minor in the great scheme of things) Front Desk Staff - If possible, deal with the lady at the front desk. The two or three males that work there were not nearly as helpful and bordering on incompetent. Mold in our first Lower Level Room (Rm 2150) \u2013 Our first room had a bit of a mold problem from a leaky air conditioning unit. Also, the tub wouldn\u2019t drain after we showered. We asked to be moved from our room and found the one upstairs much more desirable. No Night Life (for younger couples) \u2013 if you are expecting to go dancing at this resort, you will be disappointed. There is very little nightlife after about 9:00 PM and the small sport bar is open to about 1:30 (bring a sweater, they have the air conditioning cranked). You will have to go into town to find such entertainment. The average age at the resort is probably between 40-65 years old. I would say that 30% of the guests had kids\u2013 only about 10% of the guests were between 25 and 35. Amateur Shows: The shows offered at the hotel were average at best. Don\u2019t expect any Vegas quality productions. Poor Orientation Upon Arrival \u2013 we didn\u2019t even know the resort had tennis courts until the last day! Overall, we would still return in a heartbeat. Please feel free to email us at mikepasta@hotmail.com should you have any questions.

Did you read the one \"Don't go here...I repeat, Don't go here!\" Well, ignore it! I'm sorry this person didn't enjoy his holiday....but there are always going to be those who are miserable wherever they go! I went to the Reef Coco Beach with my entire family (16 total) Nov 20th-27th. We had a blast! Here are the highlights Great beach...you can walk forever and on the left it is unspoiled and gorgeous. The boats are not worth mentioning... they were a non issue for us. The water equipment is awesome. My husband and brother in law had a great time sailing on a small catamaran. NO wait just grab it and go! The pool was wonderful....the kids were in it most of the day. The food was great...the gaucamole was delicious, and they even have portobello mushrooms at the snack bar. You can eat yourself into oblivion! The bars are great with wonderful drinks! Bring an insulated cup if you like a larger portion of your liquor. The restaurants were very good and we enjoyed the atmosphere. There is something to try for everyone. Our family loved this time together and the staff was courteous and prompt. The desserts were incredible. If you chose something that you didn't like you just try something else. Yum! This is not a time to start or maintain a diet! We would meet at the lobby bar in the evening. Great mixed drinks (especially margaritas) and Corona's for the guys. FUn and good people watching. The rooms were spacous and you could see the pool and bits of the ocean. This resort is a wonderful size for those who don't like to stand in line, and/or walk a long way to the beach, restaurants and pool. It was perfect for us. The omelets are delightful in the morning. The chef will cook it to your specifications so just tell him. I liked my cheese on the egg not put on the grill....this was no problem! The resort's location was better than expected. Playa del Carmen is so close you can walk. It is fun to shop or browse the small shops. We were told it is safe day and night and it felt that way. This is unusual at other all inclusive locations (Dominican, Jamaica, Cancun). YOu can get your daughter's hair braided in town far cheaper than they offer in the resort. OUr girls all have long thick hair and they had intricate braids done for 30 dollars. This is a bargain as it took 2 hours. OK now the negatives (although that is far too strong a word) Yes, the water in the showers fluxuates hot/cold. We got used to this pretty quickly and la cooka rachad in there when it got too hot or cold. This will NOT ruin your vacation. The entertainment was not Broadway...but who expects that at a small all inclusive??? They did start the evening having the kids come on stage and sing/dance. Our girls ages 7, 10, 11 and 12 loved this and refused to miss it! The staff who work at the pool area are a bit on the immature side (playing a cell phone on the microphone, throwing each other in the pool) but hey they are kids. My biggest beef (keep in mind I judge cheerleading and have had many years of dance classes) was the staff's half hearted dance poolside in the afternoon. Kids if you are reading this....Move it and give it 100% or don't bother! So, I hope this is helpful. This is a wonderful place to enjoy a relaxing fun vacation. Go enjoy yourself and have fun!!!

The hotel is on the best stretch of the beach and it is idyllic. The boats in the sea causing an eyesore?? Please! These are tiny fishing boats not oil tankers! On the whole I think the hotel offers tremendous value for money. The facilities are not 5-star but they are not charging 5-star prices either so I have no complaints. The bar offers all international brands not just local brands and the filtered water they serve is fine so there is no need to buy the water. The food is repetitive after a while but it is good quality. I would recommend you go out into Playa del Carmen and spend a few evenings there after eating and a few drinks at the bar as it adds variety. It is only $3 in a cab. We met a few people at the hotel who were complaining but they had all been there for nearly 2 weeks and never left the place once so they probably had cabin fever.

Tour staff: only saw her once that was at the end of day 1 \u2026. Didn\u2019t want any trips anyways!! Check in: quickly done, which was good as we were tired! Front desk staff: Alfredo is the best! Always courteous staff. Room assignment #1: we had NO SAFE in our room, so requested another room \u2026. taken care of the next morning. Safe: our Rm # 1 had it\u2019s safe out for repair in Cancun??? Rm #2 had a safe that didn\u2019t work \u2026. Kept our cash and Visa cards in the safety deposit boxes at the front desk!!! Mission accomplished. Room assignment #2: exceptional location, Rm # 2316 looked out onto the quite end of the pool and we could see the resident cats lounging in the sun on the grass below us every afternoon! (only heard one cat fight)! Bellhops: very helpful, in our room switch especially! Cleaning staff: We always left a tip and some kind of goodie from home for our room cleaners \u2026 a huge part of a holiday for a mother is NO making food, doing clean up, or picking up after your family!!! That\u2019s why we really appreciated the cleaning staff!! Buffet Breakfast: Mom had fruit & toast a lot (her fav) but I had fresh eggs with a variety of accompanying yummies!

Folks coming from the ocean, remember to rinse yourself at the ocean/poolside showers before getting into the pool. \u2018Animacion\u2019 Staff: Damien, Christine, Zouhaila & Melina (kids club) were THE BEST kids \u2026 they are ALL hard working and their families must be VERY proud of them!!! Worked 8 am. til 5 pm. then back for evening activities (8 pm. til MN at least) and only one day off a week!!!!!! Kudos to them all!!! They were not pushy, but friendly & informative when asked questions by visitors! They even TRIED to teach me Spanish!! Brave souls! Beach: FAB, I had never seen turquoise water/ white sand beach before so I was blown away!!! The sand is NOT HOT to step on (something about it being ground up coral!?!?!) Some ladies with bare chests, but we played \u2018Rate the Boobs\u2019!!! Lunch counter: good service & the BEST guacamole I\u2019ve ever had (Mom even LOVED it too); tostados with a side of guac. For lunch, then coconut ice cream with Kahlua drizzled on it for dessert!! Yum! Pool bar staff: Great staff, they laughed at my \u2018no spill\u2019 Tupperware cups (16 oz. \u2026 take your own, you won\u2019t regret it!!) Clean up staff phenomenal \u2026 love their towers of used glasses! Al A Carte rest (Italian): Servers/ food (ate here twice) most variety here & servers remember you from other days in buffet as they work everywhere (Mexican): Servers/ food (ate here once) okay, but not a lot of variety, service great though Dinner at buffet: good selection, and hot too \u2026 liked ASIAN night, different theme every night! Evening shows: took in two, they were great, especially the Mexican dance night!! We were usually in bed before 10 pm. Room Service: 3 dinners from room service, small selection but tasty treats! Love the desserts especially! Very prompt. Jewelry store staff: Jose, Juan & Manuel gave very good prices and much better selection than in town at 5th Avenue. My family loved the silver I brought home. Hotel front door staff: always pleasant when we came & went from the hotel Sister resort (Reef Playacar): we went one afternoon, very closed in and jungle like. Separate buildings 3 stories tall. Buffet lunch had not as many selections as Cocobeach, but service was great. Pools small, with not nearly enough sun beds. Nice gift shop. Cabs: Very nice cabbies, one lovely leather seated cab cost us $1 more \u2026 Mom says it was worth it (leather soft as butter)! 5th Ave. shopping: noisy, we walked to town along the beach (25 min.) on the hottest day (yuck) so did not enjoy that much and found better deals at the Reef Playacar gift shop and Playa Del Carmen Mall (on far side of town) Check out: warned to check out evening prior to departure, did so, and got late check out for $10/hour extra (well worth it, as we stayed at the pool till we had to shower & change into travel clothes) Guests: Couples from Holland, Belgium, England, and Italy nice \u2026 generally Americans loud & rude except one lady from Texas, and a Boston Red Sox fan from Louisiana! Tipping: everyone deserved something, anywhere from $2 - $10!! Cancun Airport: dirty, hot (no A/C), cramped; and the washrooms are DISGUSTING!!! Flight Home: Okay, but sad to leave Mexico, as my Mom & I really did enjoy each others company, and we had one week of the best \u2018people watching\u2019 ever!

We have traveled to Cozumel & Cancun over fifteen times along with Puerta Vallarta and were very eager to experience Playa Del Carmen. Coco Beach had by far the best restaurant quality food of any all inclusive hotel that we have stayed in. Typically, after breakfest I do not look forward to hotel food. The Itailian restaurant had one item that was very good (Linguini ai Frutti Di Mase) which had shrimp, calamari, and mussels. It is true that you need to reserve daily for this at no latter than 7:15 am. We found the Mexican restaurant to be very good as well. Snack bar even had cocunut ice cream. All of the bartenders were very friendly even though I never noticed one person ever tip them. They were very thankful for any tips and it showed each time I came to the bar. The front desk was very helpful. At check-in, I requested an ocean view room and this was only $25 extra per day! Only 16 of the 200 rooms are ocean view. We stayed on the second floor next to the Sports Bar. I recommend staying in the southern section if you can get it. Our room was just above the kitchen and storage rooms. You could hear pans being dropped every night at 3:00 am. Most of the deliveries even came at night and the cleaning crew cranked up the music when the sports bar closed each night. I still slept well but this is my only complaint. The sports bar is pretty neat. They can bring in any game that you wish and the adult beverages in all of the bars include top shelf. I've never seen an all inclusive with Jack Daniels. You typically only see the lowest grades of domestic liquors but this resort had some diversity, much like my liver. I do recommend taking a walk on the beach in the morning to the city of Playa Del Carmen. It is around a thirty minute walk. The shore line is very relaxing . When you are in town, stop by Casa del Agua Restaurant & Cafe at 5th Ave and 2 North. I had the best warm sub of my life. It is called the Mexicanna (ham, refried beans, olives, a little spicy). This along with a frozen frappachino that resembled a chocalate shake with coffee and whip cream with sprinkles. All of this for only seven dollars. Highly recommend. Only a three dollar cab drive back to the hotel. Anyhow, I would recommend this resort. At a total price including air fare, we only paid $475 per person for air, hotel, taxes and four nights/five days. Outstanding value.

The rooms are average size but clean, great balcony (all have at least a partial view of the ocean). Yes, you do have to pay for bottled water in your room and they only restock your mini bar every other day but if you are in your room that much, maybe you are missing the reason you went to Mexico in the first place. We had water bottles that we brought and filled at any bar and we never drank anything from the mini bar because we only went back to our room to shower and sleep and we took a drink from the bar with us. Yes, you do pay for a safe, but you can also use the safe deposit boxes at the lobby for free. If you ask instead of getting mad you can find out a lot of info that is useful. I am not saying this is a 5 star resort but for the money, you can not go wrong. Staff was very helpful and all had great attitudes if you only took the time to talk to them and not treat them like your personal butlers. That happened a lot from what I saw. Food in the buffet was great, always had a good selection and I felt that they changed up the selection enough that you don't get tired of the same thing. The specialty restaurants were great (the Mexican is really not what we expected, but the food was great, I had coconut shrimp one night and steak another, wonderful), and the Italian was also wonderful. You can get lobster in any restaurants for $22 extra. We never did because everything else was so good but it looked good. Drinks are top shelf and plentiful. The bartenders know how to make almost any drink you want. We noticed they have Jim Beam and Jack Daniels that a lot of the resorts do not carry because of it being imported. (Reef Playacar we noticed does not carry any top shelf liquor). Pool was beautiful but we never spent any time there, we were always at the beach. You can walk the beach to the left of the resort and you will not hit another resort for a few miles. To your right you can walk to Playa del Carman and pass a lot of resorts. No snorkeling really but there is a somewhat dead reef out from the resort (watch for boat traffic) that you can snorkel at and we saw quite a few fish and even an eel. The Reef Playacar has a really small beach but the rest of the resort is really, really nice, so if you are not a beach person, the Reef Playacar is the place for you. The city of Playa del Carman is close and we walked there almost very night after dinner to walk off the fullness from dinner. We shopped, people watched, drank and ate there. We never felt afraid during the walk no matter when we went. As a special treat go to Ajua Restauant on 5th and 10th, you will have a ball. Go after 8:00 and stay late and DO NOT bring children if you want to have fun. We do not do tours, we talk to people and find out were they went and we catch a cab or take public transportation and we go, pay to get in and save about 80% of what you would pay for a tour.

After reading some of the reviews I'll admit I was a little worried, I'd also read nightmare reviews about Cancun Airport! After a 10 hour flight (thankfully we'd booked extra legroom!) we arrived rather tired and expected a lot of hassle and all of our luggage to be checked, but it was fine we went straight through, no problems at all! When we arrived at Reef Coco Beach we were allocated rooms immediately, although one of the rooms wasn't ready but a replacement room was found straight away. The rooms were very comfortable, the air-conditioning great, the cleaning of the rooms and the resort was excellent, the mini-bar was restocked regularly, the staff were all very friendly. We had no problems with bookings for the restaurants, although we did notice that sometimes there wasn't an 8.30 sitting @ the Italian restaurant! There were always plenty of sunbeds available around the pool and on the beach, and entertainment team were great - they didn't pester you if you didn't want to join in. The food was very good, although the menus in the Italian and Mexican weren't changed during our 2 week stay, but this wasn't a problem as we also ate in the buffet resaurant and there was plenty of variety there. We bought a large bottle of water at the shop and then filled it every day at any of the bars. I did some scuba diving with the reefmarina team, they were very good, their equipment was good and they were very safety conscious.

When we arrived we were not impressed by the entrance on the road dusty, building site (Oh, god no was my first reaction!). However, once we got inside no problems we were shown to two beautiful rooms overlooking the pool towards the ocean. We arrived late afternoon so I had contacted the hotel prior to our arrival and organised some suprises for Chloe's birthday - a table was booked for us in their Italian Restaurant and the table was decorated with banners, candles and confetti (which I sent from the UK) and the staff were great Chloe was treated beautifully. Almost everyone in the restaurant came over and wished her happy birthday, the staff sang and made it just the perfect birthday! The pool was great, the entertainment staff work hard at getting the guests up and having fun, but if your fun is people watching then that seems to be fine too they are not too 'in your face'. (We went to the Copacabana in July and they will harrass you to bits!) The hotel did not seem to busy but I think that the main reason for this is that it is a very small resort with a large pool and a beach and so people spread out. If you are looking for a large noisy resort then this is not the one for you it is small and compact - perfect for us - but not for all! There was evening entertainment which seemed reasonably well attended - not always to our taste but we are English!. I would agree that they need to work on the Sportsmans Bar more staff need to attend, a DJ would be good too, but Playa del Carmen with its trendy bars is only a $3 cab ride away. The entertainment staff work very, very hard, for some reason they are split up and divided between the two Reef Hotels WHY. The managers/owners of this hotel need to realise that it is important that there is continuity of entertainment staff they are paid to entertain (and can do so very well) in order to do this and please the clients they need to get to know them quickly if they are constantly moved arround how can they be expected to do this. Then you get the situation where there can be 3 staff in the Sports Bar who do not know anyone and then the evening ends quickly clients are bored and then send negative comments in to web sites like you. A very short sighted policy which I think has been made because the owners are Mexican and do not understand the psyche of their visiting guests. The food in the hotel is fine - we own restaurants - there is always something but of course it gets boring if I eat in my own restaurants for 2 weeks every day I too would be bored it has nothing to do with quality it is just the length of time. You can choose the two a la carte restaurants or why not not go to Playa del Carmen and eat there? there are hundreds of places to eat there of every variety we ate Japanese, Italian, Mexican, Steak why not you pay little enough to go to the Reef so why not go out to eat! All in a clean, compact hotel which we enjoyed, our daughters were most impressed and could have stayed another month - thanks Damien, Jean-Paul, Christine, Gill, Javier .............. you all did a great job. Mexico is a beautiful country but also a poor one you see things as you walk about which certainly make you think how lucky we are but we walked all around and the Mexican people are delightful they always say Hola and smile they may not speak English (and sorry to say my Spanish is almost non existant) but there is no bad feeling towards tourists you feel safe and secure walking the streets, beaches and town - very important for a mother of two teenage girls. Would we go again ???? My 18 year old is already planning our next trip (she thinks she can just about fit in two weeks in December!) and I have recommended my parents (and a party of 6 others) go to the Reef in March when they are having a holiday to celebrate my fathers retirement and that was booked yesterday!

This included a couple on honeymoon and also a young couple with a 4 year old child. The Managment were certainly a lot nicer at the Reef compared to Coco Beach. But the entertainment staff and Bar staff etc were nice at the Coco Beach. The Beach, sea and pool areas are very nice but the food got a little boring towards the end of the two weeks. I would not rate this a 5 Star hotel maybe a 3 Star Plus/4 Star. Can't believe you have to pay for the bottled water in this hotel when you go AI especially at a 5 Star Hotel. We found the hotel very very noisey by 7am you would be woken up by slamming doors, guests walking along the corridors. The Al a Carte restaurants were nice but the Mexican Restaurant Menu was very limited. The snack bar was very good, the buffet not that brillant. The service in the morning for breakfast for tea and cofffee was very slow, you would just go without some mornings. The cups you get are a good size we read write ups saying the cups were not big enough and some people did bring their own, we saw one American fill his litre bottle of water up with beer in the Swim up Bar what is the point of that when you can have one drink after another as your AI anyway. We had to ask a few times for them to restock the mini bar once it took them a whole day to come and sort it out. Problems with no hot water in the bathroom sink and lights not working in the bathroom. They also have problems with the safety deposit boxes we had to have ours reset about 4 times. Had a great time in Mexico , entertainment staff were great so were the bar staff but the Management were rude and kept fobbing us off. The sports bar is a nice bar but you find only 1/2 dozen people go in there. Maybe this place could do with a disco onsite as once the show finished at 10.30 everyone seemed to go to bed.

We were offered a room upgrade to an ocean-front room for a very reasonable $25 per night. Our room looked directly over the beach and was immaculate. Room was cleaned daily, towels changed daily and mini-bar refilled every other day. In terms of the restaurants, the buffet restaurant, the Miramar was perfect for breakfasts, but it's canteen style was not to our taste particularly for dinner, so we only ate there the first night. The snack bar was great at lunch times and had a good variety to choose from. We were up and about by 07.30 each day and never had a problem with booking either of the a la carte restaurants. Service and atmosphere in both was very good, our only criticism would be that the menus, particularly in the Mexican restaurant need to be extended - in 7 days stay we ate out once as we wanted a bit of a change of scene. What would we change? Our main criticism would be the space management of the beach - whilst it is not huge in the first place, locating a volleyball court in the centre would seem to be a bizarre decision.

Everyone has an oponion so we decided to make our own judgements. Tripadvisor is a great site and we will definately use it again. We have been going to Mexico for 6 years and always stayed at one particular 5 star chain. We wanted a change and chose the Reef Coco Beach on the premis that it was new, on the beach AND had a five star rating. This is definately not a five star resort!! The good comments: The rooms are clean, spotless and do not have that musty damp smell most places have. (kudos to the cleaning staff) Clean towels every day and sheets changed every second day. GREAT AIR CONDITIONING! We had no trouble getting our room even though we got there before check in time. The room that we had was unacceptable in the fact that the bathroom door wouldn't open, there was no safe and the desk lamp was broken. No problem. We were given another perfectly beautiful room (thanks Jorge) on the second floor overlooking the patio and pool. There was a partial view of the Carribean and I had a great time watching the four resident kittens playing and waiting for thier daily handouts. The entertainment staff are good people if you take the time to get to know them. It seems that the guests couldn't care less if these people existed or not. How can you entertain if you're made to feel that you're invisible? Damien tried but to no avail. There are pleanty of chairs around the pool and at the beach. Getting a reservation for the upstairs rest.'s was no problem. You usually had until 11 am. The drinks are top shelf and they don't skimp on the amount. Now for the negative comments. The biggest complaint we have is the staff. No one smiles or takes notice of your presence. Even if you tip them you get no response. Only indifference. Must be managements issues. God forbid you need help from the front desk. The GIRLS are really miserable. You have to pay for the bottled water and the fridge in your room is never stocked. We wound up going to the grocery store and got our own water and pop. Water pressure on the second and third floors is practicually non existant. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE. One minute the water is scalding and the next it's frigid.The food was not anything to write home about. There was no variety. The same fare was served every day but one. That day we missed the shrimp and seafood because we ate in the Mexican restruant. The hamburgers were uncooked as was just about everything at the snack bar. Forget about bacon for breakfast. You'll have to get along with pork sausages (yuk) or cocktail weiners. Or try shredded chicken in a green sauce with mushy nachos???? The two restruants, Italian and Mexican, have great food but are up some 25 to 30 stairs. If you have any problems or handicaps then you're going to have to go out of your way with a long walk from the tiny elavators. I managed the stairs but there was a lady in a wheel chair who had a hard time getting there. The elevators are small and only fit three people. NO air conditioning in them. This place is NOT handicapped friendly. To sum it all up without going on forever I'd give this hotel a three star rating. Although beautiful and on a great site it's a boaring little place with a lot of issues that need to be addressed. Management being the biggest one. If the staff isn't happy with the people they work for then how can the guests feel comfortable or have a great time at this resort. Great place for relaxaton being that there is nothing there to stimulate you into anything but relaxing. The food was not up to five star standards. The staff ( not including the anamation staff) are less than 2 star rating and the overall enjoyment of this hotel is about as exciting as watching paint dry.

The rooms themselves were clean and simple, with tile floors, bright walls, marble bathrooms, and a balcony. The beds were very comfortable. The Food was wonderful. We were worried about the food because it seems to be hit and miss with all-inclusives, but we found that the buffets at Miramar Cafeteria had plently of selection, good quality, tasty foods every time. The snack bar has delicious foods like burgers, mexican snacks, ice cream and sandwiches. The A la carte restaurants, Sabor and Rosinella, were both a real treat - very romantic setting, good selection, and unbelievable food. And you can go there every night if you want. You must go make your reservations in the morning when you wake up - we never had trouble getting in and there were always a few empty tables around us. There are several bars around the resort with wonderful bartenders and the drinks are cold and tasty, even if the cups are a little small. The staff is WONDEFUL. They treat you so well, so treat them well, too. They are friendly, helpful, and work extremely hard to make your vacation memorable. We appreciated them so much. The resort itself is lovely. Kept immaculately clean. The lobby is beautiful with a high palapa roof, a fountain, and couches and benches. The grounds are well-kept, with a big pool, that winds all throughout the resort, many loungers and chairs, a pool bar, and palms. The beach is gorgeous, the sand soft as flour, no rocks at all, and many palapas and loungers. We both treated ourselves to a massage on the beach - which was perfect after our wedding stresses. We loved this resort. We woke up naturally before 7 each morning, because we wanted to soak up as much sun, relaxation, and beauty as possible. We would most certainly recommend it for honeymooners. It is a three dollar taxi ride or a 20 minute walk to Playa Del Carmen where you can shop in the many many shops and eat in the many many restuarants and bars. We did not particulary enjoy the evening entertainment, but that did not bother us because we weren't looking for entertainment. It did seem, however, that everyone else loved it - the theatre was full of happy faces every evening, while the two of us enjoyed Pina Coladas and Long Island Iced teas in the lobby bar. There were many topless women on the beach, which didn't bother us at all, but those who would find it offensive should consider that, although I'm sure every resort along the Mayan Riviera is scattered with topless women. We didn't do many day trips, but did go snorkelling at Xel-ha which was an unforgettable experience for us, it was our first time snorkelling, and was worth every penny.

We tipped the buffet waiter a few times and the alacarte restaurant waiters, maid, water boy for refilling our fridge with a little more water and bell boy. Next trip I would probably only tip bell boy, security at front of Hotel (he was always very helpful getting taxis etc) and the alacarte restaurant waiters as this is one-on-one service. The weather was great, even the afternoon showers were warm so we remained outside (this only happened twice). The animation staff were very up beat and got involved with the guests with water volley ball etc. , the tequila volley ball was fun! My daughter met another girl her age there from the US, they had a great time and the animation team certainly contributed to them having an even better time. Swimming pool was perfect and the beach was my favourite, clear waters, great for swimming, relaxing or snorkling around. The marine shop has a great first time snorkling tour leaving right from the beach for only $25 US per person I would recommend this tour. Exchange rate at hotel is very high, bring US dollars before you depart (we brought Canadian) although we brought pesos as well which worked out OK. The shot over jet (2.5 ton w/440 horspower jet boat) tour in Cancun was awesome if you like adrenaline rush things! Down side was nobody took pictures so if you go on this tour, bring a camera and ask the atttendants on shore to take a picture or 2. We booked our dolphin tour with the local Marine shop rather than through our sunquest representative as he was hard to track down. If you want to swim with the dolphins they will proabably quote you $125 US but for $50 more you can go on a cruise to an Island called Isla Majures (includes bereakfast, lunch and an awesome crew), and swim with sting rays, view the tiger sharks while snorkling, turtle hatchery through a bicylce tour, wacky bird show and a golf cart tour ($10 extra) around the Island...well worth a visit. The video they take of you and the Dolphins is $50 US but well worth it. The show at Xcaret in the evening is a must as well as enjoying the park durnig the day. Next trip we will visit Xelha and the cenotes. The Jewelry store at Reef Coco Beach was actually better to buy from than any store on 5th avenue, they have beautiful pieces of sliver, opal and turquoise and their prices are negotiable! The Reef Coco Beach is very clean, great service (I recommend the Italian restaurant, didn't think much of the Mexican), the buffet was OK with its better days and worse days, the fresh mangos in the morning were delicious. Only a $3US taxi ride into Playa Del Carmen (we paid in pesos 50 pesos did the trick). We ended up visiting 5th avenue 4 times, try the mayan coffee at the brazillian steak house (you can't get that at the resort), flames and a great mix!

The only reason I did not give this hotel a 5 * rating is because when we arrived at the hotel they could not find our reservation we sat there in the LOBBY which was hot, hot, hot and took some stuff out of our suitcase to change since both kids were hot with the clothes we were wearing. They gave us bracelets and told us to go get a bite to eat and they would look for our reservation. I told them I called the hotel 2 days before and with the reservation number I had provided they were able to find it. They wanted to know who I spoke to but I never took down the persons name. Anyway, after a very stressful little while they eventually found our reservation however, they still could not give us a room because they were over booked. So they shuttled us to their sister property in Playacar for 1 night and compensated us by offering us a free snorkelling tour...we were not intrested in the snorkelling tour so we opted for the late check out instead. Antonio at the front desk was most helpful even after I almost started yelling at him for having no room for us...he arranged for the shuttle to and from the sister property and when we came back to the reef coco beach the day after we received an ocean view room which was awesome. In this hotel you will ONLY get pool view or ocean view (not many ocean view rooms). SO WE LUCKED OUT! Firstly I would like to say that the hotel is beautiful and the food was very good as well...the 2 specialty restaurants (mexican & italian) were equally nice. Although, the Mexican was not quite for us I suppose its an aquired taste. However, the italian was yummy and my hubby is ITALIAN and he agreed. Another thing is that there are many topless europeans at this location so if you have young kids who like mine were shocked to see that and kept saying \"look mommy boobies\" you might get a bit embarressed. They have to do something about all the bees getting in to the breakfast area. NO TIME SHARING HERE - WONDERFUL!!!!! MINI CLUB: was very nice as well...equipped with X-BOX, arts & crafts etc... 5th avenue was wonderful....PLAZA PLAYCAR was not as intresting. If anyone wants any additional information about this hotel just e-mail me....I have to say the entire week was wonderful even our early morning flight with AIR CANADA was awesome as they upgraded all of us to BUSINESS CLASS and we therefore flew in style.

We don't know what a 5 star hotel should be like, but we did't have any problems at all with Reef Coco. The entertainment staff were fabulous. They are not professional dancers, but you can see they put in lots of efforts into it. We enjoyed the shows. As to food, soup lovers can't miss that - all 3 restaurants make superb soup. We did 2 Mexican and 2 Italiano. Don't forget to try their desserts. Food from buffet and snack bar are freshly made. Just one thing to comment is the slowness of service in the morning. An applause goes to the cleaning ladies. Morning calls usually come from their trolleys, but it's okay as we have to wake up for restaurant reservation. Sometimes we told them not to worry about cleaning our room, but they would tidy it up for us anywaz later of the day. We left them some tips on the table but the money just sat there for a couple of the days (we forgot to leave them a note). And one day, we got our safety deposit box widely opened and went out for the whole day. When we got back, everything was still there. And the staff clean and brush beach chairs nightly. I agree that it would be better if there are more umbrellas. We borrowed the bikes and rided to their sister hotel. It's much bigger but we didn't like it at all. Very busy and you will see pieces of feathers floating on the pool water... disguisting! To 5th Avenue, we always walked and it took us 15-20 minutes. Bargaining is a must. Do compare prices before making your final decisions. We've been there for quite a few afternoons and never got bored. Need to exchange pesos? Go to Scotia Bank. They offer better rates and you can enjoy the nice a/c while you're waiting. Overall, it's a bravo vacation! Going back or not?

We were looking for a 2 week, relaxing holiday in the sun. We were absolutely thrilled with what we got with everyone feeling that it was their best vacation, ever. We saw other 5 star hotels in the area that were much more grand inside, with respect to antique furniture, etc, while the Reef Coco Beach was furnished with a more minimalist/modern flare. It was full of intriguing sculptures and was very clean, tidy and comfortable. The only comment that I can possibly make that could be considered negative was that the cleaning staff started early in the morning (around 7:30 AM) and their trolleys made enough noise to wake you in the morning, but with an 8 year old boy this was going to happen anyway. The hotel, its surrounding area and the beach were kept immaculately clean. There were always hotel staff around cleaning and tidying. I\u2019ve read about food complaints, but I have no idea why anyone would complain. One of our biggest praises of the resort was its food and drink service. The snack bar did serve very good food, but the hotel\u2019s buffet restaurant was superb. Buffet food easily can be bland, cold and uninteresting, but we found the food to be very good, fresh and served hot. Food hygiene was exceptional as was the flavour and the daily/weekly variety and choice. I will say that our 8 year old preferred the snack bar to the buffet restaurant because of familiarity with the snack bar food, but that is to be expected with children. The two restaurants (the ones requiring reservations) were easy to get into and of high quality, though the menu selections were limited. The rooms were nice, clean, and comfortable. The pool was fantastic and our son spent most of his waking hours there. The beach was beautiful, soft white sand, clear warm, calm ocean and plenty of open space for long walks along the beach. There was also a fantastic coral reef within a 100 metres of the beach, which we spent many hours snorkelling on watching crabs, spiny urchins, sea cumbers, sea fans, various corals and a multitude of brightly coloured fish, and if that wasn\u2019t enough, the resort would take you out to a more protected one for a minimal fee every afternoon at 12:00. With all these wonderful things to say about the resort itself I can\u2019t forget to mention the hotel staff. Whether you were dealing with the front desk, house keeping, bar tending staff, waiter, clean-up crew, security guard, entertainment crew, etc, you were always met with a smile and someone who was interesting in making sure that you were happy, etc. We hope to go back to the Reef Coco Beach, again, very soon.

My wife and I arrived on Thursday and we were told that our room was not available because the air conditioning was broken. I suspect that the hotel was over booked. The resort manager had us lined up to stay at the Gran Porto Real for the night which was fine since the Gran Porto Real is a five star establishment and he told us that we would get two snorkeling tour certificates on the house (a $110.00 value) for the inconvenience. He also said that he would send a car over to pick us up at the Gran Porto Real at 11:00 am to bring us back to Reef Coco Beach. When I called the Reef around 10:00 a.m. I was told that our room was ready and that a car would be sent to pick us up at 11:00 a.m. After checking out at 11:00 we waited for our ride. At 11:10 I called to see if our ride was coming and was told that the car was on the way. When I called back at 11:25 I was told to grab a cab and that the Reef would pay the fare. So we ended up grabbing a cab. When we arrived we were told that our room was not ready and our luggage was placed in a locked room to keep until the room was ready. When we walked back from the luggage storage room we were told our room was ready. Somehow the people running the Reef don\u2019t have it connected. Since Friday was pretty much shot for doing any tour type activity we hung out at the Reef and had some great food and drinks then took the ferry to Cozomel for while. When we returned that evening the resort manager mentioned that our snorkeling tour certificates would be ready on Saturday and I said that would be fine. I purchased the Tulum Mayan ruins tour for Saturday morning and left a wake up call for 6:00 because the tour was leaving at 7:00 a.m. I never got a wake up call and their excuse was that the operator that was doing the wake up calls was sick and did not have a replacement. I was lucky enough to wake up in time to catch the tour. When I returned from Tulum I inquired about the snorkeling certificates and no one knew anything about them. Apparently the hotel manager (Alfredo?) neglected to tell anyone about them and of course we did not get to go on the snorkeling tour. He offered to give us a bottle of wine and waive the $6.00 charge for the safe deposit box in our room. Whoopee!!! Of course when we checked out in the morning the clerk did not know anything about the waived safe deposit box charge and had to go looking for permission to waive the charge. I have to admit that the hotel, the food and the drinks are terrific and the fine dining at the Sabor restaurant was fantastic but what the Reef Coco Beach has is a four star establishment with two star service.

A group of 10 from ages 25 to 31 went and each of us had a blast. Our first day there we relaxed and enjoyed the beach, the pool & the hotel. Our second day there we went on a trip through funjet to Indiana Joe's. We did the ATV ride through the jungle & drove speed boats out into the ocean. This cost $50 per person and well worth the money. That night we did the Bar leaping tour. This cost $55 per person and included open bar, transportation from and back to the hotel, and 3 bar stops for an hour and a half at each one. The first stop was at Carlos N Charlie, then you walked down the road to Senior Frogs and then you were shuttled down the road to the Mambo Cafe. That night we had dinner at the hotel at the Sabor the Mexican restaurant you make reservations for and let me tell you well worth getting up at 7 in the morning to make the reservaton. After dinner we watched the show put on by the hotel not sure what that one was called that night but it showed Mexican dances and dancers, very nice. Saturday we walked to town and shopped. You can take about a 15 minute walk down the beach into town or a $5 (one way) taxi ride. We walked to and from the scenory when passing the other places along the beach made the walk worth it. Shopping is fun and make sure you bargain with the vendors. Some can be pushy but just say no thanks and walk away if your not interested. We had many many many cuban cigars offered to us. That evening we enjoyed the beach and pool at our hotel some more. Later we went to dinner at the second restuarant the Italian food and once again well worht it. The food at both of these places was excellent. Then we went to the show put on by the hotel not sure what this one was called either but they impersonated singers and the show was very good they put a lot of hard work into they even did one of Brittany Spears videos that involved a snake and they even had the snake. After the show we decided to go back to Senior Frogs for more fun we went to the front lobby where they put us in a taxi that took us there for $5. Unfortunatly we left early Sunday morning. As for the staff, we had contact with staff members all around the hotel for days at many different places and never once was anyone rude. I think that had a lot to do with us treating them the way we like to be treated and that paid off. As for the food, we ate many times at the hotel in many different places and we thought everything was great. Let me say the hotel, the beach, the pool, the food and the staff at the Reef Coco Beach are AWESOME and we had a GREAT time.

During the day, there is a snack bar open, which cooks anything from burgers and chip to barbeque ribs and sandwiches. If you get up early, make sure you get a chance to book the Italian or Mexican restaurant. Trust me, go there, all unbelievably FREE, steaks and things. The best and most welcoming chef of all is Ricardo, and he works his backside off every night. The hotel is outstandingly clean, as you will notice the difference from the part of the beach the hotel owns, and a few minutes away. You will always see someone cleaning weather it's in the kitchens or cleaning the pool. If you get a chance, be sure to swim with the dolphins or visit xel-ha which is a place full of natural lagoons, and big fish, and again, well worth the money.

The hotel is situated on a gorgeous stretch of beach. The only draw back is there are fishing boats anchored right in front of the hotel. There is a natural reef where you can go snorkeling. Its worth the swim out there. The pool is nice. The staff worked round the clock to keep the resort clean. The activity staff was great but more activities would have been nice. Plan your day accordingly for water sport activities. They have limited equipment available. The food at the buffet was OK. After the 4th day we started to get bored with the selection. The specialty restaurants were good. You have to get up early in order to get reservations. The drink portions are very small so plan on making several return trips for refills. Some days service was acceptable while other days it was not. The town is not a short walk. Opt to take a cab it only costs $3. The teen center is nothing to write home about. Our teens never stepped foot inside during our entire stay. If you have time, visit their sister hotel.

The specialty restaurants were good though. The really bad thing was the giftshop. My wife was sick so we went to get some pepto bismol. The price on the container (marked out) was $2.40 US. The cashier stole from us and made us pay $12 as the price the hotel needed. I was appalled but paid it to treat my wife. I returned the next day after hearing a similar incident from another guest and inquired about the price this day. I was told $8 dollars now. The clerks were clearly stealing and I brought this to the attention of the manager. The manager, Alessia, did nothing and failed to follow up with me as to this date. As a last slap, we left a customary tip for the maid. We were delayed 6 hours by FUNJET and we returned to our room to find that the boy who goes to the room to fill the refrigerator had stolen the money from the maid before she got there. Incredible!

It also meant there was little queues for drinks. though the sports bar is shut at the moment we were told it was to be finished in the first couple of days of our holiday and it still is no nearer to being finished The rooms were better than our expectations and the level of cleanliness was extremly high. The food in both the A' la carte menus was perfect and service was spot on.the buffet varied as one night it could be really good food the next it could not be average and sometimes it appered to be on the cold side. The service from staff was exceptional there english was not perfect but they did there best to understand and keep you happy.

We had no problem getting reservations at the restaurant. We usually found good pool side chairs, shady spots near the beach were at a premium. The boats parked near the beach are a draw back, although most leave during the day. The reef cuts way down on the surf. The nightly entertainment was varied. A group of mexican dancers came in one night and that was a great show. The buffet was also dressed out in a Mexican theme that night, complete with mariachis. The in house staff was hit and miss. They had a few great moments, but at times, it was like watching an aerobics class. The Freddie Mercury Tribute was incredible, as well as Shakira. The best was the Disney show, with the finale of the Lion King. The entertainers from Mexico and South America were by far the best dancers and the best looking, the Canadian girls were lacking in talent and appearance. The Reef is located a $3 cab ride from town. Budget car rental is just at the end of the street and the road to the ruins are easy to navigate. The ATV/ Jungle tour was a highlight. It's just down the main road from the Reef. I have to say that the entire wait staff and maid staff at the Reef was excellent. All-inclusive means that tipping is not required, but it is Mexico and tipping is hoped for, appreciated and often well deserved. bring small bills. Topless bathing is frequent and is not restricted to the beach. The good news is that it isn't required. Tell the kids not to giggle too loud. Bring lots of sunscreen!

Our second room had toilet troubles the first couple of days also, but they did come fix it after the second request. Things like that are going to happen and can't always be controlled so we just went with the flow and had a great vacation. The hotel did have a bigger variety of food than any other place we've ever stayed, and they did keep a close eye on the temps of the foods. Everything I tried was good, but I'm a picky eater! The entertainment staff was great. Julie from Arkansas likes diet dr pepper and you can't get it down there so take her some if you have room in your bag. She was a huge help to us. Also one of the Canadian girls likes twizzlers, but I can't remember her name. The staff was very helpful and most of them understood at least some english. Xcaret was great for the kids. We did not book through Funjet though because it was $25 add'l per person for the transportation and then you are at their mercy. We decided to take a cab to the park instead, it was $10 USD each way. That way we could go back to the hotel when the kids gave out. I'm pretty sure us adults were give out way before they were. We did the kids program with the dolphins and they enjoyed it. Definitely some lifetime memories made on this trip. We went to 5th Ave. shopping twice and it cost $3 USD each way for the cab ride.

Because the weather was so good I even got to try Pinnaker of the end of a boat much similar to parasailing. The food was the best part...for an all inclusive resort...there was an abundance of different choices, steaks, seafood, pasta, fine pastries and the best homemade \"Coconut\" Ice cream I ever tasted...we even had Kaluha drizzled over it. The drinks were good too...we lived off Pina Coladas and Cervesa! I cant explain it all...I just wanted to say...it was AWESOME..and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get away.

The food was for the dogs except for the snack bar and the mexican restaurant which you had to be up at 7:00 am to get a decent reservation for. DO NOT DRINK THE WATER IN THE SINK OR THE TUB - it will make you very sick. They do not stock the mini bars regularly as promised with bottled water. The beach is not good - lots of boats parked near the swimming area - within yards of it - get ready to inhale fumes and floating gasoline. This is located in a rough area - public beach right next to their beach and questionable characters around. The whole place is lacking in any air conditioning - the elevators are like back ovens if you go in the summer and the rooms never do get cold. THere is no entertainment worth anything except maybe for kids. Bring everything you might need - the shop in the resort will rip you off big time - price gouging like 5.00 for a can of hair spray equivalent to suave and 8.00!!!! for a box of personal hygience products. The staff is not very helpful either and give you no guidance whatsoever. THe only real orientation you get is the attempt to sell you high priced trips. Watch out for the taxi drivers - tell yo its 3.00 to town and always charge you more - have exact change. When they dropped us in town they dropped us at the bad area instead of the good shopping area - we did not even know it was there until the last night when we finally found the brick streets which were better to shop in at night instead of day. The beach sits behind a coral reef so no waves and again, the boats parked everywhere probably payinb the resort to do so. If you like the vendors on the beach as I did in Puerto Vallarta, there are none. Everything in Playa is a big ripoof - many things were cheaper in the US, It is a tourist trap. A decent seafood meal will set you back at least 20 dollars a person if not more. If you go to the ruins, do not get stuck with paying for a guide. Be aware that they will charge you 3.00 for video camera usage. THe only decent food at the resort is the snack bar, so be ready to eat hamburgers, nachos and guacamole. It would have been helpful if a menu was posted for the next evenings meal so you would know where you wanted to eat. Much of the food was recycled and presented in a different manner from the previous day of nights meal. THere is no selection of food in the cafeterian (miramar) and only one thing being prepared at the grill. What there is, is not good at all, and put in casserole dishes and cold. The breakfast on some mornings did not even offer bacon. On the dessert side, all there is primarly is flan and ice cream. Trying to get a room you like is next to impossible as well as getting a king sized bed - that is a premium. The beach as well as the one pool is a struggle to get a decent place unless you get up at 7 am. On the return bus, everyone complained about this place and how unorganized it was. IT truly is and with eight people going on our trip, we felt like we had been ripped off and wasted a lot of money (about 6000 between the eight of us). We did not visit the sister property, reef playacar because it was not walking distance as we were told - it was at least 20 minute cab ride. I have stayed at 4-5 star before and this was in my opinion, about a 2-3. I have stayed in cancun area twice before and Puerto Vallara at least five times. I have always had great luck with Allegro properties, and will stick to them from now on, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE and do not read the positive reviews you read - a whole bus full of people agreed with me that as I, they would never return to this rip off place.

Overall, I would say it\u2019s an excellent hotel but it\u2019s not perfect. The resort is on the smaller side (under 200 rooms and it feels like there are much less than that) compared to some other resorts and I found that very attractive. The hotel is very pretty. The lobby is very nice and the main pool area is awesome. The hotel is really clean. It seemed like the Reef Coco Beach staff was always cleaning. I think one of the biggest selling points of this hotel is the beach. I walked miles down the coast and I found the beach at the Reef Coco Beach to be the best one. It is very clean (no trash on the sand) and very private. There are much busier beaches further south about \u00bc mile but the way the land crests out, you can\u2019t even see that busier beach unless you walk towards it. Those beaches were loud and packed with people. The Reef Beach was private and was used only by the hotel guests. In fact there are hotel staff at all times making sure. The north part of the beach at the hotel is completely secluded and is great for long walks. The rooms were very clean and most of the rooms had a balcony that overlooked the pool area. Each room has an electronic safe in it that costs $3 per day to use. Many of the room safes didn\u2019t work however. The hotel also has a fun staff that holds activities all through out the day such as beach volleyball, bocce, water aerobics, pool volleyball, bike rides, etc. Towards mid afternoon it tended to get a little loud in the pool area with music playing and the Reef staff dancing Salsa. I think they tried to wake up people that were taking naps in their rooms. I didn\u2019t mind the music or the noise. If you are looking for a completely quiet hotel where you never hear anything and are in complete privacy, the Reef Coco Beach may not be for you. If you need something that private I recommend a private villa somewhere. Overall though, I thought the activities kept things interesting. The location of the hotel is great. It\u2019s a 15 minute walk along the beach to Playa del Carmen where you can do plenty of shopping for local crafts. The food at the hotel was pretty good. The buffet always had plenty of choices and the Italian and Mexican restaurants were good. The food was good, not excellent, but the service was AWESOME. They went out of their way to meet all of your requests. I can\u2019t say the same though about the snackbar staff. My girlfriend has food allergies and requested the food be made a certain way and the cook gave us attitude and a dirty look. I think it was uncalled for. Overall though, the staff is really really nice. We did start to get a little sick of the food towards the 5th day but I think it\u2019s because we weren\u2019t used to eating that much Mexican food. I think the Reef Coco Beach falls just short of a true 5-star (such as the Occidental Royal Hideaway) but overall for the price I think it\u2019s an awesome place to stay. I didn\u2019t want to sound too critical in my review but I just wanted to point out things both good and bad. It really is an awesome hotel and I would definitely go back.

My husband and I just returned yesterday from a 4 day stay. Our first room was not what I had requested through my travel agent, but I was told that I may not get what I had wanted. My husband presented the man checking us in with a \"gift\" to his favorite charity, we paid an up-grade fee, and then we were placed in what was called a through and through. This meant that we had beach front, 2nd floor, and our front entry looked out on the pool. It took us nearly 4 hours to get into our room, and so we were pretty tired by that time. We didn't end up with a king size bed as we had requested, 2 doubles, but our view from the balcony was so great. Guess you can't have everything, but next time we will. I will have to say that the food was very good. I had fresh guacamole, queso, and chips nearly every day from the snack bar by the pool. The breakfast and evening buffet was very good. I ate fresh fruit, had scrambled eggs from the back grill, drank milk, water, juice, had Italian pasta with marinara, but I never ate any meat. I also never had salads, but I saw many others indulging. My husband and I never became ill, so we were very happy about that. I did see several of the staff checking the temp. of the food on the buffet bar. The desserts were wonderful. I love flan, and they did an excellent job with it. We never went to the upper restaurant for Mexican or Italian night. We just stuck with the buffet. One night, through no fault of the hotel, there was a power outage from about 5-10 PM. We went up to our room, pulled the beds out in front of the patio doors, opened them, left our front door open a little, and just thoroughly enjoyed the breeze blowing in from the ocean. I was almost disappointed when the power returned, but our room was a/c cooled again in no time. I think our room must have been the last one cleaned everyday because she didn't come until 3 or later. We always left her a tip, and she did a good job.

I have not seen so many smiling and accomodating waiters at breakfast. I called them all \"Smiley\". The two wonderful restaurants, one a Mexican and one an Italian were very good. (One small complaint that you have to make reservations daily after 7 AM and they were usually booked by 7:30-8:00 AM) A little beach bar directly South of the complex is a fun little touch of Mexico and breaks the resort feel. (They played one of my Herb Alpert CD's while I sat in their covered bar just feet from the waterfront) Lots of activities and fun shows at night, however just laying around in the breezes was very relaxing.

Playa is very close and evening trips into town ($3. cab ride) are well worth the effort. We met lots of nice people from all over the world. If you treat people with respect, typically they\u2019ll return the favor. If not, avoid them. The staff is great and involves everyone that\u2019s willing.

I read all of the reviews I could before choosing the Reef, and I'm glad I heeded the good ones, and took the bad ones with a grain of salt. The hotel was wonderful. The atrium is beautiful. When we first got there, inside was extremely hot, and we were told that the electricity was off in Playa Del Carmen, but within an hour, it was back on for the rest of the 5 days. We arrived around noon, knowing that checkin wasn't until 3pm, but they went ahead and gave us our room anyway. I saw reviews that said the rooms were small, but they were more than adequate, with more than enough room for my wife and I (and our kids had they travelled with us). We were in a corner near the lobby, and had a beautiful view of the pool, with the ocean behind it. Nice and quiet. We weren't bothered by the late-nite lobby, or the shows which were very close. EVERY worker was extremely polite, helpful, and more than all that, seemed like they really wanted to help us. Although we don't speak Spanish at all, there were no language problems or barriers to get through. The pool was immaculate, and the beach was the best we had seen. The ocean looked cleaner blue than our pool at home.The hotel was at probably 2/3 to 3/4 occupancy, so we never felt cramped by too many people. We always found a place by the pool and beach, and had no trouble getting kayaks and snorkel equipt at the onsite marina. There were many bars, and all of the bartenders were the friendliest I have met. The cups are small, but they give you whatever you want. The one place I feel the resort falls short on is food. There are 4 places to eat. One is a snack bar, not unlike snack bars at Wet'N'Wild, or Six Flags, or other daily attractions, but I thought the food was better. I live on burgers most of the time, and theirs were very good. Not as enthusiastic about the chicken sandwich. The waffle fries were great, and the nachos were unique. The tortillas they used were very thick and had a hearty flavor, and they piled on the pico de gallo and gaucamole. The snack bar is open from about 11am-6pm, and was a daily ritual for us. The Italian restaurant was okay (we never had trouble getting reservations when we got up at 8am), although I would say nothing spectacular. The atmosphere is what made the restaurant. We weren't impressed at all with the Mexican restaurant, but that may have been because we ate there our last night, and got the 930 slot so we could have as much time on the beach as possible, and by the time we ate, we had already drank quite a bit at the lobby bar, and were tired. At both of these restaurants, try the desserts. They are to-die-for. The worst place was the cafeteria. Although the food looked good, without fail it was cold, or at least cool (the items that were not supposed to be). Breakfast was okay. The best part was at the back, where in the morning the cook would make made-to-order omelletes, and in the evenings he makes whatever the specialty is. Otherwise, I didn't find much to eat there. Special kudos to Jorge, the Lomas/Funjet rep at the hotel. He was there anytime we had questions. He showed us several possible trips we could take. Most of these were in the $100 per person price range, and I was concerned that we wouldn't get our money's worth. We finally decided to go on the Maroma All-Inclusive tour. It was great. It was all-day. We started out snorkeling, which lasted from about 9-1. Then we had lunch of fajitas (included in the price). After our food digested, and after sitting on the beach for awhile, we took a 45-minute trip on 4-wheelers, and then a 45-minute 2-person speedboat ride. It was well worth the $100 each we paid. We saw 2 of the nightly shows put on by the entertainment team. One was for the crowning of the weekly Mr Reef, where they bring 4 males up on stage and make them do a lot of silliness. It was really funny, but parts might not be appropriate for kids, depending on how strict you are. The other night was a 70s revue, where they danced to different music from the decade. The only other complaint I have is that many things are geared toward kids, but there is no place for adults to really go and get away. Having said that, we never had a problem. The kids there were very respectful, and we have 2 of our own. Just an observation. A great time all-around. I wish we would have had time on the last day (our flight was at 1140, and we were picked up from the hotel at 830am, so only time to eat breakfast.

I found all of the reviews helpful but found there were a few things not mentioned, good and bad. I thought I'd add my 2 cents. This was our 4th visit to Mexico and we have stayed at all-inclusives previously, usually about 4-5 star resorts. First, check-in was a little hairy, having to change our rooms 3 times. However, once we were settled, it was easy sailing! BEAUTIFUL BEACH! Getting chairs was not a problem at all. However, if you wanted a chair under a cabana, you had to be up early. I would have to agree with many of the reviews that this hotel is barely a 5 star. If anything, the staff makes it such. The rooms are small but clean. Food was very good, especially the specialty restaurants. The service and the staff were EXCELLENT! Everyone was very friendly, helpful and interactive. They come and sit with you at the meals and chat. It gives you a chance to meet all of the different activities' staff. In terms of activities during the day, there were plenty: volleyball games, water aerobics, snorkeling lessons, biking, etc. They also have massages on the beach. The price was not that great though - $60USD per hour (which is not much difference from where I live). The one of the times we visited Mexico a couple of years ago, we stayed at a resort where the massages were $25 an hour! We did one tour - Tres Rios - which was a load of fun if you are interested in doing a ton of things in one day. Now, the few things that I thought would be helpful: There is no real nightlife! The shows are pretty lame and there is no disco on the premises. If you want to dance, you have to venture into town. Also, there is no jacuzzi, which I thought was odd. Contrary to what you are told, the sister resort is not nearby. It is a 15-minute cabride. I was under the impression it was in walking distance. All in all, a great vacation.

This is a vey nice resort for anyone who wants to hang around and soak up the rays and generally just kick back. Any problems we had were more related to our tour operator than the facility. For example, we got hit with a stiff \"fuel surcharge\" when we arrived at the airport, our flight got in late at night in Cancun and even later on the return and even though we purchased the trip based on having adjoining rooms for our children we didn't get them. The front desk told us that tour operators always promise that but the hotel was unable to provide us with them unless we upgraded to ocean front rooms for an additional $25 per night. In cash por favor senor. Didn't fall for that. Anyway by day 2 we at least got rooms away from the lobby bar and close to each other. The pool and the beach are spectacular, the entertainment staff works hard and the food is varied and not bad. We would have like more authentic Mexican food but that is personal preference. The Italian rest. is not what we thought of as Italian but rather a \"Mexican interpretation\" of Italian. The Mexican rest. was our favorite and we had no problems getting reservations to either one. The buffet is fine for breakfast but the snack bar is outstanding for lunch type stuff like burgers and dogs. The bartenders at the pool bar are the hardest workers at the place. I've had some experience with diving and found the dive shop proffesional and very knowledgable about local conditions. A highlight of our trip was our 15 year old daughter experiencing her first dive. The side trips arranged by our operator were interesting but very expensive, this is obviously a big profit center for them and they work it hard. Playa was not all that charming, it's a lot of tacky t shirt stores and overpriced jewelry stores. Someone said it reminded them of Miami beach and I'd have to agree. Finally, your experience there will depend greatly on who else is staying at the resort as it is pretty small and intimate. We shared our week with Germans, Dutch, Italians, French and Canandiens. Most were very nice but the French lived up to their reputation for being the rudest people in the world and the Canandiens may have set some sort of record for beer consumption. I went to college in the '70's and thought I could put it away then but these were adults and they started first thing every morning and went all day and most of the night. With a few exceptions they weren't too rowdy or offensive it was just really remarkable to watch them go at it. They really got their money's worth. In short, if you're into the all inclusive scene this is probably a great place and on the whole we had a good time.

First I want to say that I have travelled extensively and have been to this area 3 times. I am not a complainer nor do I have high expectations of a place unless I am paying top dollar and I am at a Ritz or Hyatt. This trip was booked knowing full well there would be some glitches and that it was a bargain. I was just looking to get away from it all. So here goes. Check in was a breeze, My sister, her 13 yo son, my 21 month old and myself had no problems. We were offered a choice of 2 rooms 1st floor or 3rd both by the lobby. I checked the 3rd floor one and said it was fine never checked the other.Good choice since It was very quiet at night. Lobby is pretty, not big but just right for the size of the place.The rooms are small, bathroom no biggie and not as lavish as say Copacabana but hey no problem. Our safe was broke but no big deal we used the lobby safe and saved some money. When we arrived the hotel was less than full and was nice for 5 days until the Saturday before Easter, then it was packed. They had signs up offering a 2 night stay at Iberostar Cozumel for free, departing April 8th. I guess that was there way of trying to solve the overbooking.Now to the rest.The pool is nice and long not very wide or again extravagant with fountains and jacuzzis, but good enough. The beach is Gorgeous really. Plenty of chairs at both areas. The pool was never crowded but boy the beach was. We got 6 am wakeup calls to get a Palapa. but I have done this on all my trips. I also reccommend getting up early to reserve your specialty restraunt. by 5 minutes after 7 it is usually booked at both. This was a busy week so again maybe a little different then low season.The buffet, well here is my beef. I loathed going there honest. I have never been to a place where I could not enjoy breakfast it was so humdrum. I am not a big egg eater but love waffles etc. Well everyday at exactly 7 when we ate, the french toast pancakes and waffles were ice cold. I dealt with it and caught on by putting them through the taoster to warm them. Other than that it was the usual but unusual breakfast fare. Hotdogs for breakfast nah not for me. I ate alot of toast and buns. Yummy. As far as lunch thankfully there was a snack bar it is a life saver. Great food but no rhyme or reasion to ordering. Sometimes your order was given to someone else. Who knows.Never ate a real meal at dinner Buffet only went for my son. It looked ok. We ate at the Mexican restraunt 2x and loved the staff and food. As far as Italian I was there once and was really sick that night. I just sat there before making a speedy exit to my room. My sis said it was ok but we are italian and from NY so thats a touchy area for us. Picky I guess.Went into town tons for shopping, dinner, lunch. I love PDC and it is so close and cheap by taxi. Did not walk it.We did have problems with the minibar never enough water. Even with tipping. Front desk said they come by every other day, and gave us a ton to compensate. As far a s maid service it was always late in the day. We asked for it to be done early since I needed to bring the baby back to the room around 3 and it always was a problem having to get out so they could clean it around 4 or 5. So that annoyed me a touch, since they didnt seem to try to get it cleaned early. Our toilet broke. I called no one came, 2 hours later called again and they came right away and fixed it. So that was ok.All in all a great trip. Now the bad part I was sick on Tuesday and never quite felt better all week. The night before we were leaving I got REALLY sick.Had to cancel our dinner in Puerto Adventuras. I was pissed Vomited 13 times in 4 hours not to mention other things. My sis went with the kids and I was left to die it seemed, lol. When they got back I had them call the Dr. He was there in 30 minutes. He gave me an exam, a shot and some meds. 140 dollars US. I did not care. I was dying.....Parasite he said. He also mentioned others were sick but I am not sure the reason. I barely ate anything since my first sick episode so I am not sure if it was the food. Next day I felt a little better and we departed with no problems. My son then was sick the whole time in airport and on the plane and I thought I would never get home.Anyway Like I said I dealt with all the things that were handed my way. Did they ruin my vacation, nope. As we were leaving some man was screaming at the desk that they needed to buy more umbrellas and palapas that there was nooooo way he was getting up early to get one and he was appalled.

Access to the beach, pool side, restaurants, etc. was plentiful because the number of amenities per room is a very good ratio at Reef Coco Beach. I agree with its 5 star rating. I highly recommend this resort and look forward to visiting again.", "Date": "March 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Vacation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1726153", "Content": "We were at the Reef Coco Beach from Feb.23 to March 04.04. We booked through Holiday House. If you book through Holiday House, you do not get an orientation upon arrival, nor do they let you know that there is a rep available. The rep is also the Sunquest rep. He is thre in the morning and late afternoon every day. Flights were great (Air Canada direct from Toronto, ON) Flew into the new terminal. The line up for getting your pass-port stamped took approx. two hours. Going through Customs was a breeze. PLEASE ignore the people you meet as soon as you pass customs. They will try to convince you to take a day trip to see a new resort by offering you all kinds off free stuff, ie: a free trip to Cozumal and free day trips or Dinner cruise. All you have to do is leave them a $40 US deposit, which you will get back when you visit the Hotel. They don't tell you that it is a high pressured sales and you must leave your credit card number.Also my Husband left his sweater on the bus from the airport to the hotel. GONE.The Hotel is wonderful. We had a room right on the beach, ground floor. The location is great, but you don't have a view of the resort and the wind is very loud at night. Room safe didn't work, but they have safety deposit boxes in the lobby. Food is not 5 star, but okay. The hot food on the buffet is warm to say the least. The Italian and Mexican restaurants are very good. Be sure to book early in the morning at the buffet restaurant as the restaurants are very small. The snack bar by the pool bar is very good. Chicken is similar to Swish Chalet.The bar tenders are great if you tip. If not, they ignore you. The drinks are great, with brand names.The pool bar is not open late as indicated in there brochure. They close at 6:30 PM. The only bar opened late is the sports bar.The entertainment staff are the best. Damian (Spelling ?) was my favourite. Ask to see his tattoo.They entertian you all day long and are most friendly.The in room fridge is filled rarely. Apparently if you leave a tip in the fridge, the service is much better. Just something we never thought of. They were also very short of wash-clothes. If you call the front lobby, someone will eventually show up.All in all, it was a great vacation. We met a lot of great people there from Canada and the US. A visit to Senor Frogs is a must.", "Date": "March 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Duncan, BC", "Title": "\u201cDream Vacation in Paradise\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1682036", "Content": "We arrived at the Reef Coco Beach resort with some reservations due to some negative early reviews. WOW, were they wrong! From the moment we were greeted by the hotel staff we received fabulous service. Our room had a spectacular view of both the beach and the pool area. The food was fantastic in both the buffet and the pool snack bar....unfortunately we didn't find the time to take in the a la carte restaurants. Highlights of our resort activities were the scuba lessons in the pool, riding the bicycles to the sister resort in PlayaCar, jetskiing and snorkelling at the reef just off shore. The location of the resort makes this a destination you would not want to miss.....beautiful, undeveloped beach for miles in one direction, yet so close to Playa Del Carmen in the other direction. The international activities staff are energetic and fun!! The entire staff are friendly, helpful and kind, making you feel very welcome. The small size of the resort contributes to a more intimate, relaxed atmosphere. One week is toooo short!!

The lobby and pool area are absolutely gorgeous. The staff was very helpful and pleasant the whole time. The pool staff also put on the shows at night. They do a good job. The Disney show, 70's show, and the professional dance shows were all wonderful. Although they do not start on time often, they are worth going. There are dance lessons, step or water aerobics classes, and games that are put on by the staff daily. The meals are average, but the Italian restaurant is wonderful! Make reservations for it early in the day or else they will run out of space. A trip to Senor Frog's is sponsered by the hotel on Friday nights. The cost is $25.00 USD and includes transportation from and back to the hotel and all the drinks you want for 3 1/2 hours. Fifth Avenue, or the \"shopping district\" is about a 30 minute walk down the beach and that is where you can find your Senor Frog's, Carlos and Charlie's, and bargain shopping. Trips to Chichen Itza and Tulum are also recommended if you are into history.

We stayed from Feb 9-16 and had a great time. This was our second trip to this area of Mexico. The Reef Coco Beach is located just north of Playa Del Carmen (allegedly a 15 minute walk from 5th ave but reality it is more like 25 minutes). Let me start with the negative. The hotel was recently completed and the gardens are still very immature, do not expect to see lush gardens or wild life like Iguanas or Geckos since niether are here yet. Our room was located just off the lobby which seemed a nice location at first, we had an excellent view of the pool and we could see the beach as well as easy access to the gym, spa and tennis courts. At night the bar accross from the front desk opens and doesn't close until late at night, the halls and room have zero sound absorbance so you can clearly hear the revelers until late in the evening. The hotel should open this bar earlier and close it earlier as well, we didn't mind the noise in the early evening but at 12 and 1 in the morning it became too much. My suggestion if they offer you one of these rooms don't wait, immediately inform them the accomodations are unnacceptable. The rooms that would be the worst for noise were rooms 2227, 2228, 2229, and 2230. On with the good because believe it or not that was the worst this hotel had to offer. The food was outstanding, I have stayed at several all inclusives in and out of the states and this was by far the best food I have ever experienced. The service could have been improved but was more than acceptable, expect improvements as the staff become more comfortable and experienced. The Beach was great, no rocks in the swim area and just on the other side of where the dive boats tie up is a very nice reef which protects the swim area from the larger waves. The reef is only a 100 yards away from the shore, plan on snorkeling it's free and well worth the effort. My daughter went to the kids club only once and really enjoyed playing with Melanie from Canada, she is one of the sports and activities employees. Unfortunately none of the other children were using the kids club and she didn't want to go back, because she was playing with the other children outside of the club. The sports and activities staff were really friendly and tried to get as many people involved in the games as possible, they went out of their way to make our stay FUN!! One note they didn't inform us at the desk nor did my travel agent but if you stay at either the Reef Club Playa Car or Reef Club Coco Beach you have access to both facilities. We didn't discover this until it was too late to go check out the Reef Playa Car, but we will next time since we are planning on staying at Coco Beach next year. One last negative comment but this is not the hotel's fault. For some unknown reason the French and French Canadians seem to go on vacation to have a miserable time and to try and make everyone else miserable. If you go on vacation to any hotel smile be happy and treat the staff and other guests with respect you will get the same in return. We saw several French speaking couples just going out of their way to be difficult with the staff who in return just ignored them to the point of upsetting the guest. One lady started speaking loudly almost yelling at a waiter because the toaster (which the guest operated and was not broken) had burnt her toast. The waiter smiled, nodded said \"si\" and walked away (usually a sign they don't understand whay you are saying), later I noticed her table wasn't getting the service the rest of the tables were, maybe the waiter did understand after all. You may be a queen or a king in your country, but to the employees at these resorts you are just another guest and they try to provide us with royal treatment, if you feel you deserve OVERTLY royal treatment go somewhere like the real Riviera where Kings and Queens are normally attendeded otherwise Smile and Be Happy!!", "Date": "February 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Resort\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1648658", "Content": "We just returned from the Reef Coco Beach and had a outstanding time.

Make sure you ask him to make you a special drink. He seemed to really enjoy that. Our room and view was great. We could see the pool and Ocean on our balcony. The grounds were beautiful and very well maintained. The outside food grill was where we ate our lunch everyday and loved it. Breakfast in the buffet was great. Make sure and try one of their made to order omelets. We can't wait to go back down there and set at the pool bar and talk to Pedro.
