{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Value for Money Hotel Guelfa Florence. Value For Money . November 2008 James Baldacchino - Malta Having been to almost all major cities in Europe I know what one could expect in some hotels so I can say that the most important thing is having what you paid for , preferably more but absolutely not less.I do not usually stay in the lower end standard hotels but this time I needed a cheap,clean and central accomodation. Hotel Guelfa is a 2 star hotel, quite old ,like everywhere in central florence and situated very close to the central railway station and to the city centre.The furnishing is very simple, the rooms are small and be prepared to have breakfast somewhere else as you go out in the morning but the owners and staff make the difference.They where very friendly and polite and always ready to help when asked for.The most important thing for me was that the linen was spotless clean and that my father and I felt safe in the hotel and not afraid to leave any valuables as stated in a review I saw on this site.In fact I did not take my expensive camera for that resaon and I was terribly sorry,but anyways that means that I will have to go back again to Florence to take some more beautiful pictures of this incredible city. My final comment is that we paid the right price for this central hotel and it was worth staying there for a 3 day stay just to watch our favourite soccer team play in the champions league.Forza Fiorentina.", "Date": "Nov 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR830323653", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Baldacchino"}, {"Content": "Save yourself the \"Expense\" Given certain restrictions on the language and content which I may use I enter this message with a certain number of \u9225\u6997onservative\u9225?opinions. Firstly the room for 60 Euros was adequate but was extremely dark and depressing. With a loud air conditioning unit and windows opened by the maids so that flies and mosquitoes could get in made the stay even more uncomfortable. I suppose one may say that it is a cheap room in a good location, given its proximity to the Duomo and the Firenze SMN (central train station). However the room may not be seen as so cheap when around \u62e2400 worth of sunglasses went missing there. When we left our key at reception and returned it was not there. The room was open and the key inside it, and I will not make any further accusations. When I telephoned after our stay, the staff were very unhelpful and did not give any adequate explanation, given that there is a security gate controlled by the staff.", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR610446382", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "studenttraveller2008"}, {"Content": "Don't stay if you don't have to I arrived in Florence main station and the agent got me room in this hotel.

The 2-star hotel has a good location - about 5 minute walk from the Dome. As it was high season and everything seemed to be booked out, we stayed in their shared bathroom double for two nights. The room was really tiny and faced the street. There was quite a lot of noise from the street and from the small airconditioner next to the bed (and it wasn't even powerful enough, so it was still quite hot). The shared bathroom was also very tiny, to shower, you had to separate yourself from the toilet with a curtain and there wasn't too much space to move. But for 55\u9227?per night /double, I guess it could have been worse, and - as a lastminute deal, the location made up for most of its flaws.", "Date": "Aug 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR941890988", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Aaanaaa"}, {"Content": "Mixed review Initially I was pretty happy with the place. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They helped us with our train bookings etc. And at first I thought the room was pretty quiet.Unfortunately the noise outside is not what you need to worry about, it's the noise from wihin. Like a lot of other budget priced Italian hotels, the soundproofing is very poor. The banging of a door, voices in the hallway, someone running up the stairs are not only clearly audible, they seem to be intensified.The location is great, the staff are great but if you're a light sleeper, forget about it.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR323005649", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Ouzo_Lovers"}, {"Content": "Don't Stay here! I was quoted 85 Euros/night with continental breakfast ($312 for three nights). My cousin and I stayed in room 24, which was very plain. The room had a king bed and a twin bed, small table with TV, and armoire. The carpeting desperately needs to be replaced, as well as the lock on the bathroom door. The bathroom was very large with tub and curtain, toilet, bidet, and sink. The bathroom was in much better condition than the bedroom. Our room was very quiet as it faced an inner courtyard. I do not recommend the place based on a few things: My cousin complained about the tub because there was no stopper for her to take a bath; the cat that hangs around proceeded to use the tile floor of the lobby bathroom as its toilet; and the place needs to be updated, such as the carpeting. The location was good in that it was just a 5 minute walk to the outdoor market areas and about the same amount of time to walk to the Accademia. Up the street is a great little restaurant, Trattoria Guelfa on via Guelfa, 103r.", "Date": "Apr 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR179011588", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1",
