Our room had a small balcony with two chairs and a small table, overlooking the swimming pool, and we could also see some of the beach and the ocean. We had paid attention to the reviews and asked to be in a room away from the street side. The room was very nice, with everything we expected from a Marriott Resort, with small safe in the closet, comfortable bed, and a small table and two armchairs, as well as a desk. Our room was quiet, the beach was beautiful, and the pool area was clean and well maintained. Lots of shade in the pool area, which we liked, but there were lots of beach chairs available on the beach if we had wanted to sit in the sun. The service we experienced was very good, including housekeeping, everyone we encountered was polite and helpful. We don't gamble, so avoided the casino. It was loud in the lobby during the evening, as other reviews mentioned, but we did not need to do more than walk through to get to the elevator. We had dinner in the hotel the first night and were somewhat disappointed in the food for the price. Breakfast the next morning - the buffet - again was pricey, but it was very good. As other reviews state, the Condado area is safe, and very convenient with several restaurants and shops within comfortable walking distance. The day we checked out, we asked at the bellstand for the best place to shop for wine to take on the ship, and the bellman gave us directions to a small liquor store a couple of blocks away with prices lower than the Walgreen's, which is also a short walk from the hotel. We wanted to tour Old Town San Juan, and the concierge was very helpful in explaining the best way to get to the area, and how to get around without having to take taxis everywhere. We would stay here again.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stillwater, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but not 4 diamond\u201d", "Author": "Rob P", "ReviewID": "UR128435811", "Content": "When looking for a hotel in Puerto Rico I found that there were not many recommended hotels to choose from. I didn't plan on getting a rental car, so I was looking for a hotel that was close to several restaurants and a decent exercise facility. This hotel is about a 15 minute ride/$20 cab fare from the airport and is located in what is considered the \"tourist\" area. Upon arrival the bell hops and other people working the arrival were very attentive and as I found out the hardest working people at the hotel. They kept the cars moving and the entrance organized while cars continually tried to use the small entrance as a parking area. The room was nice, and contained a LCD TV and mini fridge. Several people said that it was safe to drink the water from the tap, but the hotel provides four complimentary bottles of water each day, so I wasn't sure if that was a hint. The bed was standard Marriott comfortable and the bathroom was larger than the typical closet size. The negatives about the room would be the carpet and the door. I don't recommend walking barefoot around the hotel room, since I found out that the bottom of your feet can get quite dirty. When entering the room I found the door to be extremely fussy. I would swipe the key card, hear the door unlock, press the handle down to open the door and the door wouldn't open. It took about 10 times on average to open the door, until I figured out that I had to hold the door handle up, swipe the card and then push the handle to open it. Breakfast is served in the morning starting at 7am, but that time usually doesn't work well for business travelers. I found that the coffee shop had pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and other breakfast items readily available. Plan on spending about $8 on a beverage, muffin and fruit. The oatmeal is not a daily offering. It is prepared with vanilla and cinnamon, if those are flavors that you enjoy then you'll find the oatmeal very good. There are a couple of restaurants on site and plenty of restaurants in the area. Across street there is a classic burger and fries restaurant. The Cherry Blossom restaurant is a couple of doors down and serves Japanese/Asian themed food. There is also an Italian themed restaurant on the opposite side of the road across from The Cherry Blossom. I never entered the premises of the casino. Upon room check in the desk clerk will give you a hand full of $5 certificates that you can use to increase your $5 bet by another $5. This wasn't a good enough offer for me to feel like I had to gamble. The hotel has an outdoor pool and play area for kids, however the kids section was closed when I was there. The beach area looked to be well kept and there were plenty of chairs stacked in piles for guests to use. The on site exercise facility was very good and better equipped than a lot of hotels that I have been to. Marriott rates this hotel as a 4 diamond property, most likely due to the services offered. The ranking is probably given based on other hotels in the area and when the hotel opened, but for $200+ a night the property shouldn't be rated that high.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longport, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cboo terp02 is right on the money with his/her review\u201d", "Author": "nametab1", "ReviewID": "UR128428803", "Content": "ditto everything booterp02 says-great location, beautiful beach, walk to great venues for dining. very young and fun atmosphere and location-perfect for taking a young adult to vacay with mom or dad. spin classes across the street. go right out of street side of hotel, makes a great jog.

Outstanding hotel, and there is not a better location in all of San Juan to stay. The Condado neighborhood is very unique; charming, upscale, walkable, and loaded with stores and places to eat to meet a variety of budgets. The hotel has a beautiful stretch of beach. The grounds were perfectly manicured, landscaped, and tidy. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The breakfast included with the price was excellent. So many hard working employees keep this place shining. Lots of nice perks that came along with the hotel, two concierge desks, rental car desk, beach umbrella and chair station (where they will set it up for you), etc. One drawback is price. Everything is really expensive. Two frozen mixed drinks were $21.00, $25 after tip. Parking was pretty salty as well. Restaurants (breakfast, for example, was $25 if you were not on the plan.....hot dog and fries $13, burger and fries $15) were up there too. Pretty high daily resort fee which, as far as I could tell, covered free wi-fi and that's it. Like others have said, take advantage of the places nearby to eat and get some local P.R. flavor/dishes. Also, go to Walgreens and stock up on drinks and snacks. The prices there were cheaper than they are back in the states.

Since I had researched this hotel through their website and tripadvisor, we decided to stay here. Ok, let me start with our arrival. We were arriving from a southern caribbean cruise, so we kinda got to the hotel early. Obviously our room was not available, which is understandable. However, the hotel allowed us to do a pre-check-in. They securely stored our bags, and offered to call me at my cell phone when our room was ready. We then went for a walk inside, and outside the hotel so we could get to know the area. Before I continue to the next topic, I must say that the front desk girl who completed our pre-check-in was ridiculously unpleasant. I don't recall her name, but she was very young looking (like 19), thin, with long black hair. She did not demonstrate any care, or interest, or sympathy. Did not smile, did not say \"welcome,\" and gave me dry responses to my questions. I mean, It was so bad I felt like cancelling my reservation right then and there, and going elsewhere. But of course, I did not want to pay the penalty so I stayed. However, a couple of hours later when our room was ready, we were helped by another girl who was extremely the opposite of the previous. It's incredible how this is possible. I mean, this other girl was the sweetest, most interested, kind, welcoming person I have ever encountered at ANY HOTEL! I Don't remember her name either, but she was about 30, brown hair, and had a great smile. Anyways, we had booked an oceanfront room with a balcony on a high floor. The room was spacious, clean, and we had absolutely no issues with it. It had a small refrigirator, where I kept my Medallas (Puerto Rican Brand Beer). The view from the room was obviously great. You could see the people down below, sunbathing, swimming, and surfing. You could also see the other hotels along the coastline, and of course the great ocean views. The hotel in itself, we though was great. The lobby was just recently re-done. It has a nice bar area right in the center of the lobby. They also have a cafe-bar to the right as you enter, and towards the rear right they have a casino. I had read here before someone saying the casino was small, but I don't know what they were talking about cause it seemed huge to me. The pool area was nicely kept, but in my opinion was somewhat small. The beach area was good, and the hotel has attendants that can offer you a beach chair/umbrella. Even though I stayed here for 4 days, I did not eat or drink at the hotel; therefore, I cannot comment. Down the street from the hotel you have many dining options. And for people who live in the states, there are alot of American Businesses in the area. Just north of the hotel there is a Burger King, and further up a Fuddrockers. Just south you have a Subway, a Wendy's, and also a Walgreens. We found all of this very convenient. All in all, the hotel looks great. You are greeted as you arrive, your bags are taken if you wish, the front lobby door is opened for you. The entrance, and the interior of the hotel looks new, clean, and in great shape. We enjoyed it, and will definetely be back.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Islip, New York", "Title": "\u201cGREAT FOR FAMILIES AND RIGHT ON THE BEACH!\u201d", "Author": "KGIRL02", "ReviewID": "UR127814348", "Content": "This is the 2nd time we stayed at this resort.

Let me explain... CHECK-IN: We arrived early (well before 4:00 PM check-in) on Monday, April 2nd. I was very happy the front desk was able to accomodate us early but not so happy that the front desk clerk seemed a little robotic and a tad bit unfriendly. I'm never expecting cartwheels but actually looking up at me as you're speaking to me and a smile would be nice. ROOM: We get to our room and it's typical full-service Marriott - comfy bed, too soft pillows, typical amenities, the usual. On the upside, the room was airy and clean (except for the hair left behind on the bathroom floor), there was a fridge and the partial ocean view from our \"city view\" room was a definite plus! HOTEL AREA: If you're visiting Puerto Rico looking for a rich, historical and cultural experience be sure to rent a car and venture far from the Condado area and this San Juan Marriott. This area of San Juan felt more like South Beach Miami to me. It wasn't until I ventured out of the area that I felt like was in Puerto Rico. High-rise condominiums, Starbucks, Walgreens, Fuddruckers, Pizzeria Uno's, Wendy's, Chili's are all within walking distance from the hotel (all of which I can get at home) -which brings me to my review... FOOD: We ate breakfast at La Vista in the hotel and honestly, the best thing about this restaurant was our server Senora Clarimar and perhaps the view (running a distant second). Clarimar was genuinely friendly, she was sweet and extremely helpful with guiding us on what to see in Old San Juan and other parts of Puerto Rico. The ONLY reason we chose to eat there a second time was because of her and the wonderful service she provided. Otherwise, skip it!!! La Vista is drastically overpriced (buffet 24.95 pp) and the food was edible but not great. As we took an early morning walk around the neighborhood one day, we noticed a few local spots serving breakfast for much less. Take the walk and save a bunch! GETTING AROUND: We rented a car which I definitely suggest. I bought my GPS along which I HIGHLY recommend. GPS may not be as reliable in PR since road changes accur so often but it's good to have and a general guide. One morning before heading off to the rainforest (which I'll review seperately) we stopped to ask the concierge for directions. Without looking up, she handed me a pre-printed direction card and sent me on my way. ***SIGH*** HOTEL ACTIVITIES: We didn't spend a great deal of time at the pool so a review wouldn't be fair. I can say that there's an activity board posted daily so check that for what's happening around the pool. Included as \"justification\" for your hefty 16% resort fee is a one hour two bike rental. Use it! The pre-printed resort fee \"justification\" card says one bike, two hours but Senora Rita at the activities desk quickly made the correction for us. One note of caution, when biking on the streets in the area BE CAREFUL - drivers in PR are unforgiving! CHECK-OUT: I didn't wait long to check out and was disappointed I had to wait at all. The in-room express check-out wasn't working. I stay at Marriott properties because, for the most part, I know what to expect. Some stays I am wowed and that's because of the people and service. This Marriott did not WOW me and I'm not sure I'd stay here again.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cmeh.\u201d", "Author": "ckwcraig", "ReviewID": "UR127416811", "Content": "I travel to the Caribbean at least once per year and usually stay in Iberostar, Hilton, or private brand hotels. This was my first trip to Puerto Rico, went with my bf and 2 kids, ages 5 and 9, and we went Mon-Fri in April. Upon arrival I was glad not to deal with customs but unhappy with the rude lady at the cab stand in the airport- I said San Juan Marriott Resort and Casino. She informed me in a snappy voice there are 4 of those and I better stop wasting her time and tell her which one. (Searched later and there sure aren't 4. There is a Courtyard. That's about it.) She allowed 3 people behind us to proceed before I was able to finish calling the hotel and specify it's located in the Candado region of San Juan. At the hotel, the lobby area is very pretty with a large bar area and lounge. No one was ever really in there, though. We had requested early check in a week prior but it wasn't an option and we had to wait until 4pm. They allow you to store your bags and change in the spa so you can go to the pool right away. Room We reserved a suite with king bed and fold out couch, got two doubles. By the time we were finally in there, I didn't feel like switching. It had a living room with the couch, kitchenette, large bedroom, and 1.5 baths which was nice with four people in the rooms. TV in bedroom worked, TV in living room had a terrible picture on the same channels that worked fine in the bedroom. Didn't use TV much so wasn't too concerned. Two robes and a hairdryer were nice to have. Toiletries were nice and plentiful. Bed had a cushioned topper but was pretty firm. Pillows were fantastic. Excellent hangers. Turn down with mini Hershey bars never actually was a turn down of the sheets whether we were in the room or not, just a drop off of the candy. Not sure why. Sometimes we got 3 candies, sometimes 10. Room was clean-ish. Major surfaces clean but attention not paid often to light fixtures and mirror. That may be because of their cleaning tools, though. I requested to have the long mirror cleaned because it was filthy and not useful. After cleaning it wasn't much better- very streaky and hazy. Two balconies, also nice to have. The one door wouldn't lock, though. Apparently people with ocean front rooms and Marriott priority customers get access to a penthouse club room. That was worth it according to a few guests because it included a continental breakfast and nightly appetizers. Our rate included full breakfast buffet so we didn't worry about it. Latest we could get checkout was noon so same drill as check in for bags and changing area. Pool The pool is on two levels and is small and crowded. The water slide is only open 11a-4p most days and you can count on the staff to arrive a few minutes late and close up a few minutes early. The one guy couldn't be bothered to take out his headphones and let the kids do whatever they want, others enforced rules like not going headfirst, etc.. Water was fairly warm and pool was clean. Deck chairs were plentiful Mon-Th. By Friday they were tough to get and staff explained that people check in Fri-Sat before departing for cruises on Sun-Mon. Beach The beach is white sand and clear blue water. The kids could swim in there Mon-Wed, by Thur the waves got big and it wasn't ok for little kids without help. The attendants will get you set up with chairs and umbrellas. You can walk a short way up and down the beach. No shells. Lots of trash and seaweed washes up that they endeavor to clean up quickly each morning. Restaurants * Breakfast Buffet had typical breakfast items but didn't change at all from day to day. Would be nice if they had one different thing each day. Scrambled eggs were REALLY wet. Omelettes were the best bet. Breakfast waiters are great and friendly, especially Sonny and one guy who does magic tricks for the kids. I knew I had breakfast included but didn't assume the tip was included. However, when I got my bill no tips showed up all week so I don't know if they got an automatic gratuity or what. Seems like that wouldn't inspire staff to go out of their way for you so I don't understand that policy but I guess I saved money. If you bought buffet without it being included it was about $24.95 per adult. I would not have been happy to pay that amount so go a la carte if yours isn't included. * Lunch Lunch is the absolute worst. The first day we waited so long for service and then so long for food (without complaining) that the Food & Beverage Director noticed while dining near us and comped our meal. Too bad he wasn't around later in the week because it happened every time. The only lunch restaurant during the week is the bar area and the menu is full of greasy American style sandwiches and fries, and very limited. Would've preferred local cuisine. There is a coffee shop to go counter in the lobby you could use up til 3p for wraps and salads, too, but if you are in a swimsuit it's not easy to take 2 kids all the way to the very cold (Air conditioned) lobby for lunch. As a vegetarian I don't have many choices usually and here they were very limited at lunch. The veggie sandwich at the bar restaurant is absolutely terrible. Mushy gray eggplant on one side, piece of red bell pepper on the other side. Each piece of veggie was covered in mozzarella, I believe, on a bun that had the texture of cotton. The salads were ok but not filling and there wasn't an option for rice and beans, for instance. There are many restaurants off property within a minute or two walking distance but with kids in the pool/beach, that isn't the easiest option. We tried to move to the Wyndham Rio Mar the 2nd day of our trip but it was sold out (they have nine restaurants and we were dreading a week of that lunch.) Costs about $15 per person for lunch. * Dinner Italian restaurant is closed Monday, Puerto Rican restaurant is closed Tuesday. Both have very good food for the most part. For kids you are limited to pizza and pasta and chicken fingers, mostly. They have mac and cheese but it comes in a bowl with a spoon and looks like soup. No kidding. Chef is really friendly and you can tell he cares about his job and his customers. Humberto in the Italian restaurant is an outstanding waiter. Staff at these restaurants is most friendly and most expert in resort. Costs about $25-50 pp for dinner plus alcohol. * Bar Don't get the pina colada, so chalky. Very expensive drinks at $11 + tip a pop and $8 for non alcoholic smoothies for the kids. Cocktail waitresses are really great and will come down the beach to get your order. Pool service not as consistent, some days you would see a waiter come by and other days not at all. I didn't use the lobby bar. Spa & Gym Didn't have the chance to use spa other than to change and shower. Awkward shower because there are no towel hooks and the bar is too close to the door to get the towel over it. Can't put towel over door because it goes to the ceiling. Fitness center had plenty of machines and free weights and cardio and a punching bag. Nothing fancy. Activities The kids did a couple things like hula hoop contest, cookie decorating, scavenger hunt. I think they could do a lot more with this. No kids center or activities (tennis, crafts, snorkeling, etc..) so kids get a little bored, especially when the slide is closed. The Activity Center has books, board games, some beach toys when available, and towels. They ran out of towels one day, which was a little inconvenient. Overall Not as clean as Iberostar. Lots of families with kids. Staff had some standout employees but most of them don't seem that happy about their jobs. You can tip well or not, no one seemed to care. I find the staff in Jamaican and Mexican resorts to seem a lot happier to have you there spending money. Ground floor almost every day, all day, had a housekeeping cart parked outside the restrooms for no apparent reason (no attendant nearby). Elevators are bizarre. You can get on at the lobby level with the light lit going down, get in and press ground level to go to the beach, and all of a sudden you go up 20 floors to the penthouse before it will go down. They stop on many floors where no one is waiting, too. Many people expressed confusion or frustration w/elevators during our stay. I didn't use the casino but did get a letter that all island casinos were closed from Thurs midnight to Sat noon, presumably for Good Friday (though it didn't seem to be closing on Easter Sunday?) Also I didn't think about it when booking but we had planned to sight see Friday and then couldn't since so many things were closed on Good Friday.

We didn't have the best of weather but at least the rain was warm ! The beach isn't suitable if you want to go swimming but there is always the pool for that. PR isn't a cheap place to stay or do anything in, but there is plenty on offer. My tip is that the guide books aren't always the No 1 source of where to eat out - pick up the in room phone directory and search out names you know as well as listening to the suggestions of others. The hotel food was pretty good for the price, especially on buffet night with free wine vouchers on the Saturday night. Go out of the hotel and turn left for the better restuarants. Free water in the rooms and a free to use fridge - drinks are pricey at the hotel. Great Lounge at the front of the hotel. Red Coral Lounge. Check in is pretty much a real push to get into your room before 4.00 pm. Be prepared to wait - we had to wait for over 5 hours as our connecting flight time was brought forward. But free Champagne on offer to bide you over. Because PR is a hot country - they sell SPF 110 sun tan cream, pretty much all shops, restaurants and bars have heat films on their windows so until it gets dark and you can see into them, your initial impression might be that some places look a little seedy but nighttime gives you a proper view. Taxis are abundant for trips to old San Juan - great shopping, monuments, sites, etc. Best bars and restaurants are nearer to the cruise terminal.

Located in the heart of Condado with easy walking distance of numerous delicious restaurants (I can gladly recommend some). Some nice little shops too. One day we even walked to Escumbron beach--didn't take too long and was a very pleasant walk. Can't really speak for the nightlife, as that was not an intention for our trip, but I can say that when we arrived at the hotel around 11:30pm on a Friday night, there was plenty of action going on in the lobby. As for breakfast, we found that grabbing a small pastry or bagel or such from the Coffee Merchant in the lobby was perfect for starting our day. Yes, the beach here isn't ideal for swimming, but the beach itself is very nice, and you can take a nice stroll all the way past La Concha. The pool area is wonderful as well. Plenty of shady spots if that's what you want. The pool never seemed overly crowded, and there wasn't ever trouble finding chairs. Nice poolside bar/grill too. Staff was always pleasant and helpful. My only issue was that one day housekeeping left us a note saying they would come to clean our room at 9am because we had put up our \"Do Not Disturb\" sign two days in a row. Anyways, I highly recommend you check out the Tour Desk. We always went when Rosanne was there, and she's such a sweetie. She helped us book a tour of Old San Juan, ziplining in La Marquesa Forest, and a trail walk in El Yunque. We loved them all! Very convenient--a van picks you up in the morning and it's all fun from there! Our guides were all nice and charismatic as well. It was wonderful to do an activity in the morning and lounge around the pool/beach in the afternoon (then walk to one of the many excellent dinner choices!). Our room itself was lovely. We had partial ocean view, so we could see the ocean and the pool which was a nice touch without having to pay more for the oceanfront view. The beds were super comfortable (one thing I find very consistent with Marriotts!). Bathroom stocked with all the essentials. We even got 4 complimentary water bottles a day, which was great. There's also a mini-fridge that we used quite a bit. The TV had more channels that I've seen at many other hotels (for that spare moment when you're not out enjoying San Juan or the pool!).

BIG MISTAKE! I booked the reservation over the phone mid January. During the phone conversation with the representative I mention multiple times that we would be coming for our honeymoon and how excited we were and also that we would need only one bed, a king size bed. (Obviously.) About two weeks ago, I just had a feeling to look at our confirmation email to make sure times and dates were correct. All of that info was infact correct, but on the side bar of the confirmation email I notices a statement that said: \"No king size beds are offered at this property.\" To say I was livid is an undertatement. Why would he not mention that to us? As much money as this room was going to cost (around $2000.00 for the week) I would expect that to be told to me in the conversation at some point. I was so excited to stay at the property, so I decided to call the Marriott's 1-800 number to see if anything could be done. I called and was promptly connected with a rep. She fumbled around and told me in fact there were no king size bed available. I asked her what I could do from that point to help ensure that we could get one since it was never mentioned to us that it wouldn't be available from the get go. To sum it up she basically said \"If you'd like I can cancel your reservation and you could find another hotel that could accomidate you.\" WERE TWO WEEKS OUT FROM OUR HONEYMOON. I declined in fear that we wouldnt be able to find somewhere else. (Oh so naive!) So, at that point I hung up with that rep and called back and asked for a supervisor. The supervisor made me feel so stupid. She told me that it was clearly stated in the confirmation email that there would be no king available. At that point, I was about in tears and explained to her about mentioning to the original rep that we booked with that it was our honeymoon multiple times. She then proceeded to tell me \"In that case, it is half your fault and half his fault. His for not mentioning it and yours for not reading.\" Needless to say we have canceled but I have to tell you this has left such an awful taste in my mouth. I really worried that if there was to be a bigger issue during our stay this would be the same treatment we would recieve. I will take responsibility that I didnt read the confirmation email, but I am just sick to my stomach at the lack of compassion we have recieved from their main office. A couple of days after canceling the confirmation online I got an email from the actual hotel's secretary apologizing for the misunderstanding and saying she was sorry that we chose to cancel.

I am an extremely, extremely detailed oriented person so I thought I was clear and descriptive in exactly what I wanted and I paid accordingly. The whole idea was for them to take what I wanted and make it happen, after all thats what I paid them for. So we get there and had trouble with the room as we tried to check-in. No discount on the room either. Strike one! Then, we make it all the way to the wedding day with high expectations of what should happen. The ceremony was beautiful and they nailed it. Each and every detail we discussed was present at our seaside beach ceremony. Then we get to the reception. First, we were supposed to have a bar, it was a table set up in the corner. I can let that go. Our signature drink was the mojito. They served the drinks to us in plastic cups!! Strike two! It was a wedding reception and not a bbq. I was fuming and trying not to get upset but thats not what I paid for. Then, we had heavy appetizers for our wedding. Heavy enough to where we needed plates but there were none!! The butler kept handing out napkins as if it would hold the food. We had roughly 30 guests seated at one long table and the butler was walking around to each person and serving them. It took him nearly 20 minutes to make it around the table for each type of appetizer and we had 5 choices! So finally my mom spoke up and requested plates so that we could serve ourselves, which would have been much more efficient. The event planner at the Marriott told her no, essentially, because thats not what I asked for. Strike three!! After going back and forth, which is a discussion I should not have had on my wedding day, they brought the plates for the cold food. Not happy at all.

When checking in I asked about the location and quality of the room and the clerk indicated that the room was lovely but on the small size. I happily upgraded to a corner room on a high floor which was not yet ready at 2 PM which was fine for us, being told the room would be ready for check-in at the regular 4 PM time. At 4:30 PM I went to the front desk and was told the room was not yet ready. Having spent the 2 1/2 hours in our clothes by the pool, I half jokingly said that maybe my cooperation is worth a 1/2 bottle of champagne so my wife and I could begin our celebration. The clerk said, \"It shouldn't be a problem\", except when she returned she told me that whoever was in the back didn't feel compelled to offer this to us because, \"you said you would wait\". I indicated that even if that were so, the room is now past due according to their own timeline and that although I might have been reaching requesting a little 'perk', now I was peaked at the response by whoever in the backroom was in charge and turning me away. I said, \"Do you mean to tell me you don't have the ability to comp me two drinks at the bar?\" She said, \"I think I can make that happen\" This time the clerk returned embarrassed, handing me one complimentary drink card. I was really taken back. But it was the start of our vacation and my wife was still waiting pool side, so to the beach bar I went to order a drink. The drink was made and delivered, but when I handed him the drink card the bartender indicated that the card was only good for a \"Rum Punch Drink\". I now was startled and started going to my wallet when he waved me off for the shared embarrassment we felt. Finally, (within twenty minutes of my visit to the front desk) our room was ready and we received a call asking us to come to the front desk. We went to our room which was quite nice, a bit dated in the fashion that many beach resort facilities get, yet still clean and airy and oversize with two doors to small balconies. We waited for the luggage which didn't arrive within 1/2 hour and needed to call the front desk again. The next morning I requested to speak with the hotel manager and spoke with the assistant manager Olga. I, in great detail, went through the prior days mishaps and saw how visibly appalled she was at the hotel's performance. I did not detect the slightest bit of pandering or insincerity. Indeed, following that chat the vacation kind of fell into place. Olga was first class, a level or two above the overall hotel impression but nonetheless a true professional who made sure our time at the hotel was first rate. She graciously extended herself and provided to us some expressions of her appreciation for staying at the hotel. It is directly because of her efforts that our eight day stay was a complete delight. Many of the previous reviewers comments are accurate. The lobby is simply blaring...loud is inadequate to describe the experience in walking into the hotel...it is a noise bomb. And the music is akin to an after hours twenty something darkly lit dance club having no association with its being in San Juan where some of the finest salsa and Latin music is available. The room was a little musty but seemed to air out. The buffet in the morning is nothing special for its being a four star hotel, but after learning the ropes we discovered you could order freshly made omelets and pancakes which all were included in the additional price we paid for breakfast. Our waitress, Dianna, was also a gem. For Dianna, no request was too great. She had a vibrancy, intelligence and desire to serve that each morning we looked forward too. At the front desk, kudos to Raysa who was patient and determined to find us the right room. Another call out to Eric at the Concierge desk who simply enjoyed and relished in talking about his island and gave detailed directions by auto on the day we chose to go exploring. And, again, every hotel should have someone like Olga who knew how to listen and more importantly knew how to act. The hotel, located in the Condado is in the right location. The Condado is where you want to be. You can go to a 'higher class' of hotel in San Juan proper, like the El San Juan, and be no place. Going outside the resort of the downtown hotels leaves you on highway and by streets that are creepy and not where you want to be. The Candado, and in particular right by the SJM, has within its proximity terrific restaurants, bars, and opportunities for music and dancing. Puerto Peru is a small restaurant that is not particularly distinguishable by its appearance but has absolutely delicious ceviches, bright and fresh with just the right amount of kick. Bar Gitaeno is a lively haunt where locals and tourists mix to have great drinks, terrific tapas and on Thursdays and Sundays incredible music and dance including Flamenco on Sundays. We were privileged to see a great dancer/teacher, a young women of such passion, technique and power that she brought the house to its feet. A great experience. Yerba Buena is a more authentic restaurant with quite good food but the real attraction is the Latin Big Band every Monday night. Here too, this was no amateur group. These are musicians of the top order who play tightly and improvise with the best. The arrangements and selection of numbers ran from romantic and sultry to full out, complex and lush Latin rhythms. In summary, San Juan Marriott is not all that you may want in a hotel, still when it faltered management was more than willing to fess up to recompense; and, staff was always pleasant, knowledgeable and accommodating. What I thought would be a disaster turned into a very delightful, fun and rewarding anniversary. That ability to turn a situation around is notable and to be acknowledged.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Clemente, California", "Title": "\u201cNot what I thought\u201d", "Author": "L0ri55", "ReviewID": "UR126344754", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights at this resort.

Very musty and mold smelling. We had breakfast at the hotel one morning and never ate there again. Cost was $15 and up for the worst breakfast I have ever had. Best thing to eat at the hotel was the coffee bar. We gave the hotel food one last shot. Had a lunch thing. I had 4 coconut shrimp and my husband had a wrap. Both came with fries. About $16 and up. We couldn't even eat it. They need a new chef. We went to relax and there was a ton of kids in there very small hot tub. There was always up to10 people in it. Wind was blowing a bit and the water from the shell waterfall blew water in our eyes. Between kids and the blowing water the hot tub wasn't much fun. I have stayed at many Marriott's and I would say this is one I didn't like. I guess I should look at it as being San Juan.

One of the front desk women called me as soon as my room was ready which was early around 2pm. I was greatful for the call. The door men would always open the door as you walk in and out which was a nice touch. We recieved some coupons to the Haagan Dags ice cream shop across the street (which we used).

At that price, I would have expected shrimp cocktail or smoked salmon. The breakfast was the exact same every single day. It got a little boring.

The front desk staff was very polite and professional. We had a small issue with our reservation. The front desk did a great job making it right (I now believe it was our misunderstanding, not theirs). They offered Champagne in the lobby at check in and gave us some rum and Pepsi for our room. There is a nice sized casino just off the lobby. It felt a little crowded for me. I was surprised that we actaully won a little money. We were given a ocean view room. It was nice sized, bright, and clean. We had a balcony and overlooked the pool and ocean. The pools looked nice, but I did not use them. There is a bar next to the pool area and just in front of the beach. I did visit this area. It was very nice to sit by the beach and have a drink. A little pricy, but I am on vacation. The hotel is in a great area. There are quite a few restaurants and shops within walking distance. It is about a $20 taxi ride from the airport (maybe $18 plus $1/bag) and about the same charge to Old San Juan or the cruise ports. We had 6 people, so we paid $3 per person. It would have been a little less than $18 with 1-5 people. I would stay here again. It is a little expensive, but much nicer than other places we have stayed.

The room was on the penthouse floor and was huge with 2 washrooms, a living room, a dining room and a closed bedroom.....The nicest part was surely the huge balcony which ran along the whole lenght of the room, on both sides of the building. Huge, amazing! And what a view! Unfortunately, we had booked only one night because we were boarding a cruise ship the next day...but it definitely started our trip on the right foot. The hotel itself is on a very busy street with a lot of stores and restaurants. It's directly on the beach and the beach chairs and towels are free for hotel guests. The beach bar is very expensive but my legs got weak after only one drink...so I guess they're worth their price! We walked in the casino at night and it was very nice and friendly but we're not gamblers so we did not end up playing.

Taxi from Airport to Marriott should be no more than $20 and very straight forward. Check In was good for me, I had to wait, but so does everyone on these reviews...Just presented my priceline paperwork at the front desk and all was good to go. They asked for my Amex for incidentals and you sign a paper saying you authroize them to charge for incidentals. There is a mandatory 16% Resort Fee that you cant get out of. But ask them for the print out of the resort fee during check in so you are on the same page and there are no surprises at check out (or so they cant jack it up later). 16% on $140 was only about $22/day or $149 for the entire stay...even still it would have been nice if it were rolled into the priceline schematic...although im not complaining because my rate was only $140/night. What does it include? A whole bunch of stuff from towels and beach chairs to free wifi to 2 bottles of water a day placed in your room...so dont be scared to open up the waters or store it in the freezer in the room so that you can bring it with you next day to the beach. When you log into WiFi, it scares you with $18.95 fee per day, but click accept, dont worry about the $18.95, it gets cancelled later since its part of the Resort Fee that is mandatory. Also, you cant ask for preferences through priceline auctions, but i still called and asked for a high floor with a nice city view balcony with King Bed, and they hooked me up with it even though I was a priceliner....The view is awesome from the city view, you can see all of Condado region and lights and night life right from your balcony. We loaded up on Walgreens cereals and snacks so we could have breakfast on our own in our balcony and save the $$$. Shower is weak...lcould have been stronger, but thats ok, you learn to live with it. Cable was good but some channels had weak resolution. Starbux accross the street..but wicked expensive..like over $3 for iced coffee.....they have wifi too, but you have to go through a signup procedure (no $) but create a login and password....its called \"Centennial Blue\" I liked the Starbux to cool off from the beach, i would bring my iPad and read..I never bought my iPad to the beach or pool because i cant stand the idea of sand and water on it..although lot of spoiled bratty small kids were playing with iToys near sand and water???? The starbux i liked also because locals would come in too so you get o see some Puerto Ricans. The lobby was great place to cool off too, your wifi works there too...(oh by the way, AT&T also works in all of San Juan, and its not Roaming, so you have that opion too) House/Latin/American Classic music would be piped in starting around 6 pm, and tha back of the lobby bar opens up into a night club....Casino was there but never went in as not gamblers....also a Starbux wannabe coffee in the lobby as well. After checking out, i used the business center to print my boarding passes. I never ate in the hotel restaurants, because there are so many options outside in Condado in 5 block radius. Cross the street and Starbux in front of you, walk right, and you hit HagenDaz ice cream, Zuchero, Green House (great Turkey Club sandwich for like $10), Latin Star (great Mofongo for $10. Ali Baba was Turkish and overpriced forshish kebabs. Walk to the left instead and you hit Tijuana's mexican, some Argentinian grill, further down, a BK, then Rao's Italian, and even Fudrukkers....so as you can see, no need to be bonded to hotel restaurants...Teh only time i could see hotel food being convenient is if your in the pool and beach area, and dont feel like going out onto the street. Excursions were great there is a desk in the lobby. Sign up for the Rain Forest (make sure you ask for Hime tour guide..he is awewsom and funny, and on the way back from the forest, he stops at a local barbeque stand for pork and chicken:)))) The rain forest tour was $50. We did old san juan on our own .....just 75 cents bus 23 goes right into Old San Juan, we visited the Cristobal fortress, and they charg $5 just to see it....its cool though, they have alike a small video too...On the way back, just ask for the bus station, and bus 23 will be lined up there to take you back to Condado (dont quote me on Bus 23, my memory is failing me, but ask the conciereg, I believe its bus 23). I dont have any thing negative except the little kiddies....the Hot Tub clearly has rules about no kiddies, but all the spoiled kids go in with groups of 5 or 6 and hog the thing for like hours while their obnoxious parents chat and look at them...

We began to run on the street mostly headed towards the bridge to Old San Juan(to the right as you exit) and around the bay. It worked out fine and helped us do some local exploring. Restaurant choices are great. We went to Perla( 10 minute walk) in the Concha Hotel. It looks like a clam shell and overlooks the ocean. It was pricey but we enjoyed the food and ambiance. We tried to go twice but it was booked. Beware there can be private parties and loud music below so be sure to inquire. Definitely need a reservation. Ropa Veja was a 5 minute walk. Traditional Puerto Rican food. Delicious. Loud, so make sure you are in the mood. Buda Tai, also a 10 minute walk, sit outside if it is a beautiful night. We never got past the appetizers...delicious, more cosmopolitan, romantic. We went twice just so we could continue exploring the menu. Tijuana is traditional Mexican food. Five minute walk. Delicious. Sat outside both times. Denny's definitely had the best breakfast. Solid 15 minute walk. Inside the Conrad Hotel just before the bridge. So reasonable. Local fare is just okay in the many small spots along the way and inexpensive. We went into Old San Juan one evening by cab and ate at La Dente. We felt rushed and it was just okay. Probably would have been better for lunch. Wished we had made it there during the day to poke around and really wanted to try Aqua Viva for dinner but ran out of time. About $15 cab each way. Seventy five cents by bus which picks up across from Walgreen's...never tried it. From New England you can't beat the direct flight, normal cell service and great sun!

This property has a great location but feels small. That can be good. Very little foot travel around the property and just steps to the beach. Resraurants had limited hours. Our plan was all-inclusive. One choice for breakfast, two for lunch and two for dinner. My picky eaters had a little trouble with the menus. That said, the waiters and service were excellent and we easily ordered plain rice, mac and cheese and plain breaded chicken breast with no problems. My daughter loved her chocolate chip pancakes. I would have found the food and drinks to be above-resort pricey if we would have not been all-inclusive, Pina Coladas and Margaritas were $10, smoothies were $5. A cheese quesadilla was $11, dinner for three at the Tuscany ran $186 (2 tomato soups, chicken with alfredo noodles, lobster canneloni, steak dinner and two desserts, one beer, one soda, one tea) One of the hidden food services was the lobby coffee bar that served deli foods not on the menu at the beach bar. Found this the last day there. Also I would have liked to try the \"chicken and rice\" found on the room serivce menu, Was told I couldn't have it in the restaurants. Again, I loved the poolside and beach service - very attentive. Food and drinks on the beach and at the pool and the wait staff were very much present to take an order. We were on the 15th floor (out of 20) and we had the side view of the ocean and the city looking to the northwest. We could watch the ships and cruisers go in and out of the harbor and we looked staight down on the pool. The sound of the ocean was clear and fabulous. The Walgreens is maybe 400 feet from the entrance. There are several nice places to eat within one block. StarBucks and Hagen Daz are across the street. Our room had a great mini frig but no microwave to reheat takeout. Conciege desk was very efficent with our reservations. Tip - rent a car for a day. Fairly easy to get around - most drive thrus have someone speak English. Important tip!!- The El Yugetan (sp) National Rain Forest road is seasonal, only open May to September. This is NOT disclosed on any map or tourist book. We drove up the southern entrance only to find the road gated about half way up the mountain.

It is already very easy to fly to Puerto Rico from the North East of the US. It was another quick cab drive to get to the hotel.

Besides the view, it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The beach is great, nobody bothered us there, it was very relaxing. The pool area is a bit small, and the water was very cold. We only had breakfast at the hotel, the buffet breakfast is a good start of the day. Expect high prices for the food and drinks, but it is not a surprise considering the location and the quality of the hotel. A very nice thing is to have access to the roof top lounge. The view is spectacular and you can have breakfast and snacks there. It is easy to walk around the resort, there are a few okay restaurants. Old San Juan is pretty close and for me it was the highlight of my stay on the island. I will definitely return to this resort to enjoy the summer during the winter months.

We had requested a king bed but upon check in we were told we were getting 2 queen beds, yet the beds seemed like full size to us. I felt the front desk service was sub par for what we expect from a Marriott. The concierge desk was wonderful though and that sort of made up for the other missing service. Because there is so much to review I have broken it into sections. Location: We loved the location, it was far enough from the airport that you didn't have to hear and see planes. It was close enough to old san juan that it was a quick cab ride away. But the best part was that there were a lot of restaurants within walking distance, there was also a walgreens, some shops and another casino within walking distance. The Beach: Lots of nice sand, plenty of space for their guests. The waves were always great for body surfing, not sure if it would be calm enough for really little kids. However we loved it. From the start of the beach all the way out it is fine sand, and just sand, no rocks or patches of seaweed to make your way through. They will put out chairs for you and an umbrella at your request. I felt this was a highlight of their property. Pools and Hot tub: there were two pools and a slide. One was a wading pool perfect for kids, the other one was good for all ages with a swim up bar. Unfortunately the pina coladas at the bar were $10. Neither pool was very large but there is a lot of beautiful landscaping, the only downside to that is it causes a lot of shade in the pool area, although sometimes that is nice. The hot tub was small but clean and very relaxing. Tuscany Restaurant: Service was wonderful, decor was nice, food was average, wine selection was great and dessert was out of this world. I felt this restaurant was reasonably priced. We got an amazing bottle of Chianti for $30. La Vista Restaurant: We ate dinner here and really enjoyed it. Miluz was our waitress and she was great. The food was delicious, although I did think it was a bit overpriced given the casual atmosphere. An Ice tea was $3.50. We also ate breakfast here everyday, it was part of our room rate, and we really enjoyed it. The fresh orange juice was a nice treat. I also really enjoyed that there was some local food on the menu such as Mofongo and Platain. Although we didn't pay for the breakfast we saw how much it was everyday and it was expensive. Meals ranged from $13-$16 and the full buffet was $25. Resort Fee: Make sure this is included in the rate you are quoted because they do have a high resort fee and it would be terrible to find out about this after you book. Also I had a few notes about this. It includes a 1 hour bicycle rental, although they don't mention that when you check in, but the hotel is on a main street and with the crazy cab driving I wouldn't want to ride a bike there. It is suppose to include entertainment with live music, but in the week we were there I never saw live music. They also state they have beach volleyball but again this didn't seem to be the case. One day we saw them set up a net but it was very short and seemed to only be set up at the request of two guests, after they finished playing, they took their ball and left. This was frustrating because it showed up on the activities board. Rooms: The rooms are basic, nothing spectacular. Based on the rooms I would say it would be more in the Marriott courtyard range. However the views make up for the lackluster rooms. Casino: Small but nice. The first night we were there all the tables were full that were open, the next day the only blackjack table open was a $25 table. However the rest of the times we stopped by we were able to find good tables. Drink service was a bit faster than other casinos we have been in. Gift shop: Had a great selection of souvenirs and necessities. Prices are ok, but the drinks are pricey, bottles of water were on sale for $2.50. Lobby: Very cool. literally, the always have the AC cranked, but it is really nice to look at too. Unfortunately drinks at this bar were not cheap either, aprox $10 per drink. There is also an excursion desk in the lobby and a Hertz rental car agent, both nice to have close.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cService\u201d", "Author": "Southernfolk", "ReviewID": "UR124722431", "Content": "The service suck no one would wait on you by the beach and not a allinclusive resort you can only drink what the have what they want you to drink and most time they run out of beer but if you want crown and coke you have to pay for it and if you want miller lite you buy it or any other kind of beer you buy it everywhereive went all inclusive you don't pay for anything so it services sucks !!", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAnniversary Stay\u201d", "Author": "FireMar21", "ReviewID": "UR124678970", "Content": "Just got back from a 7 day stay at our favorite hotel on the Island.

My wife and I travel to this hotel to enjoy the music in the lobby but for some reason beyond me the music change from Salsa and Merengue to Techno. Whoever was responsible for this decision should be imediately fired. The music should be with an island flavor at the lobby and the pool and beach bar.

When we requested a room change, we got one on a higher floor, about 30% bigger - so note that all Oceanfront rooms, even though at the same rate, are not the same size. The bed was comfortable and the air-conditioning good but the room is not very plush aside from that. The TV is standard flat screen - as one would see at most 4 and 5 star hotels these days, but the reception was snowy and unclear - we didn't bother complaining. The beach is a public beach but very clean without any crabs etc - great with the kids but the undertow is very strong and can unbalance one standing at the edge easily - need to be careful with children. Great service by the beach staff and bar staff for catering drinks and snacks while you're enjoying the beach. Location is good for a walk around the neighbourhood - the hotel a couple of blocks to the right is Renaissance - same hotel family but much trendier and attractive. The reception of the Marriott is more modern and the casino is not that big though we didnt have time to play in the casino. Depends on which concierge you speak to, they could give you varying guidance! There is a Starbucks and a Hagen Dazs parlour right across the hotel's main entrance - conveniently located. The breakfast served is good, nice spread - great service - but they only open the outdoor breakfast area on the weekend which is a shame. Overall the hotel staff is very helpful, warm and welcoming.

All of this information could and SHOULD be kept quiet and a photo id is the only information the staff should need. As I started my career in hotel group sales I know this is NOT good! This is a very important security and privacy issue that you need to address ASAP. In addition, I had a friend visit me for cocktails and when I refused to allow her to pay for drinks, she went to the front desk and asked for a print out of my incidentals and was given a copy!!! She was NOT asked for photo id and was given a copy of my room charges. They staff addressed her as Mrs. (my last name), but never confirmed who she was.

The room smelled - was oceanfront and smelled like mildew. Was handicap accessible - not sure why we were put here as we do not require or ask for handicap rooms - fortunately, as this room would be a nightmare if you were wheelchair bound. The handle for the water in the showe is falling off the wall and it's difficult to get the shower spray to come out of only one shower head or the tub faucet--- trying to take a bath resulted in a really wet bathroom. Housekeeping not great -- the first day we left the room about 10am and returned at 2:00 p -- still hadn't been cleaned. Put the do not disturb sign up at 205-- of course that's when housekeeping left a card stating if we were not ready by three there would be no cleaning. Called at 2:40 to say we were ready--- didn't come until well after 4 ! I had requested linen change- not done. Toiletries in bathroom not refreshed/replaced. 2 nd day came at a more reasonable time in am but left pile of dirty sheets on floor- had to ask housekeeper to remove. Beach area -- there isn't any signage indicating how chair concession works.... I stood by the piles of chairs for several minutes trying to fugure out if I was supposed to just take one and drag it or what--- was there a charge--- after several minutes I gave up- and left the beach. Went to the pool are which is mostly shady--- never was approached by any staff to place order for beverage or food- never saw staff except at towel booth. We were not offered concierge access in spite of platinum status and paying for room. Our last night-- sitting in the bar--- they have dancing girls on top of the bar gyrating to a choreographed routine--- I understand there is a casino attached, but this was the hotel lobby --on a Thursday night at about 10p --- really? And what do they do for the women business travelers???? I don't care to see scantily clad young women dancing on top of the bar unless I have chosen to go to a strip club. And I really don't want to see it at the marriot. Ever. Food- really overpriced and not great. San Juan surprised me with how cutting edge their gourmet scene is -- even the moderately priced restaurants seem to make an effort with plating and presentation-- but the Marriot has done neither, and the food is what you would have found in a typical hotel chain in the 80's Bland,overpriced and steam table worthy. Let's talk about the resort fee-- hmmmm-18% for --- nothing . 20.00 in casino bucks --- oh,except you have to match that with your money so it actually costs 20.00 to use-- and you each are allowed 1 5.00 play bill per day -- we were given 4 playbills total for a three night stay for two of us. Other amenities with the resort fee--- complimentary beach chairs and umbrellas--- hmmmm only if you can lift them and carry them yourself, apparently. 2 daily bottles of water--- well, only if housekeeper leaves, and we've already covered that issue--- entertainment with live music--- never heard the live music and I think I've made my opinion clear about the live entertainment. In room coffee or tea-- yep, the little pot to make your own. High speed Internet access -- oh, except the resort fee doesnt cover the 18.95 per day fee for this - and if you are platinum you get it anyway -1 hour bicycle rental. You can ride in the busy street, I guess. No bike path that I know of. So essentially we are getting charged 16% for nothing.

We had one of the corner rooms with two balconies. The smaller balcony overlooked the beach and ocean. The larger overlooked another building and a rooftop. The corner rooms on the other side of the hotel would have overlooked the pool instead of a rooftop. The smaller balcony had a side table and two chairs. No furniture on the bigger balcony, which does have an angled view of the ocean. I don't think we would stay here again. There wasn't anything seriously wrong, just a lot of minor things. It's a nice enough hotel in general. Here's a bunch of just general thoughts. 1. When we checked in, there were hairs on the bathroom floor and a q-tip in the toilet. 2. Room photos show a chair with ottoman, but there was only a chair. Because of the layout of the corner rooms there isn't really room for either one, but my pregnant wife has been sleeping in chairs a lot so we really needed it. I called \"at your service\" and they sent one. 3. The only place on or near the beach or pool with anything except chaise lounges was the oceanfront bar. Usually in our experience a pool will have some tables with chair-height chairs, and we would have really appreciated that. I don't think she would have had fun getting off the chaise if she'd gotten on one. 4. Internet access is included in the hefty resort fee, but nobody told us that until checkout. The landing page when you use the internet says it's $18.95 a day and will be billed to your room, so we only used it two days of our week-long stay. I bought the data plan for my iPad and used that. When we complained that we weren't told, they did take $25 off the bill. ($25 is the price of the iPad data plan.) 5. Hefty resort fee. On our highest days it was around $50 a day. It appears to be a percentage of the room rate, which is just wrong. If you're going to have a resort fee it should either be per person or per room, not a percentage of room rate. That's just blatantly hiding a rate increase. 6. I was served under-cooked chicken at the Italian restaurant. When I complained, they took it away and made me another dinner that appeared to be properly cooked, and made my wife a new meal as well. I wish they would have asked what I wanted them to do instead; I would have been happy with another order of the side veggies and some soup or something. After the first uncooked chicken I wasn't really excited about the second one. 7. As always, hotel food and drink prices were absurdly high. $40 at the oceanfront bar for a quesadilla, turkey wrap, fruit and 2 sodas. 8. The Latin restaurant was pretty good. We had dinner there once and the food was excellent. We tried another night, but were told (after our drink order was taken) that they had a buffet that night. 9. The beach was pretty nice. If you're about beach, it's much nicer than the one at the Renaissance La Concha resort, which is in easy walking distance. It's a public beach, but the hotels are built so it's kind of hard to actually get to except through a hotel. 10. The maid service was kind of uneven. They did a better or worse job from day to day, and did more or less. They always made the bed and left fresh towels, and the rest doesn't really matter that much. I think the hotel was pretty full, so they were probably moving fast. 11. Bottled water in the bathrooms every day. Two bottles. Nice touch, probably for people concerned about drinking the tap water or using it for brushing their teeth. I used tap water based on information before i traveled that the tap water would be fine in tourist areas and suffered no ill effects. 12. If you need to gamble, the casino is adequate but it seemed really small. Keep in mind that we were in Vegas in August. 13. Resort fee was not included in prepaid amount. We booked online at Marriott.com and took the lowest, prepaid amount. They told the total price with resort fee, but didn't charge my card for that amount; they charged the base rate and taxes without the resort fee. It wasn't a problem for us but I could see scenarios (like someone giving a gift) where it could have been a real problem. Just be aware. 14. The bed was really soft and felt old to me. We are used to a really firm bed, so we were sore and didn't sleep very well.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Storrs, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for a family vacation\u201d", "Author": "Nick L", "ReviewID": "UR123104622", "Content": "We booked this hotel hoping for an easy, enjoyable family getaway during the cold winter months in the Northeast U.S. The San Juan Marriott was exactly what we had hoped.

Overall, the resort was great, offering everything you needed on-site (bars, tour desk, gift shop, coffee shop, restaurants, pool and beach access). Although my comments seem negative, our experience was actually pleasant and I do think we got the best of the best in San Juan. These are all things that would have been good-to-knows or should-expects before we traveled. With the exception of one great bartender and coffee shop barista, the overall service at the resort was not fabulous. Waiters and beach attendants did not go out of their way to service you (if you wanted something, you found them) and you inevitably would find groups standing around eating or counting their tips (while working) and in one instance two gentlemen yelling at each other at the beachside grille while customers dined. The tour desk offered a little bit of everything daily, but plan ahead because the tours book quickly and the two tour desk attendants we encountered were nothing short of rude and nasty and asking questions of them was unthinkable. The resort does a great job at offering a wide array of food and drink choices (for someone who watches their sugars, I was extremely thankful for the array of sugar free flavors in the coffee shop). Typical resort prices - we ate at the buffet restaurant one time and although it was great, we opted for local dining and fast food restaurants (Wendy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Subway, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks) for breakfast, snacking and dinner. We ate off the poolside/beachside grille menu for lunches daily because the food was PHENOMENAL, the prices were reasonable for the portion sizes, and who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t love to eat poolside surrounded by palm trees. The pool and beach were gorgeous but the high tides made sitting at the beach impossible and since the hotel towered over the pool, it was hard to find a sunny place to sit and the water was ice cold. The pool bar was open from above ground but the actual pool bar stool side of the bar wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and getting a bartender to service you from above was also nearly impossible. The resort offered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153activities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but nothing you would expect, children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cookie decorating was standing in line while the lady at the towel desk squeezed bagged frosting on your cookie and salsa lessons was a loud speaker with an instructor squeezing the group in between beach chairs at the pool. The rooms were clean and in a good location, our partial oceanview room was actually perfect and sitting on the balcony every morning was a relaxing highlight of the trip. As in most Marriott hotels, the walls are paper thin and we could hear the neighbors loud and clear. The rooms did offer the essentials (hair dryer, coffee pot, safe) including the added bonus of complimentary bottled water daily. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attest to the nightlife or the spa but the casino was great and the only evening entertainment we needed. The most disappointing part of our trip was NYE. I called the hotel before I booked and asked again when we arrived and were promised a traditional New Years Eve party open to all hotel guests. The party and lobby bar were actually closed to ticket holders only (sold out before we new the gig) and the conference room they set up for the remainder of the guests was mostly teenagers and the only bar offering beverages was limited in choices and high in prices.

First, when traveling abroad sometimes it's nice to go with a chain because the level of service and quality is usually high. Very true in this case. Secondly, they are literally on the sand. A gorgeous beach with lounge chairs free to all guests. My room had floor to ceiling windows that faced the ocean - nothing but water as far as the eye could sea ... or ocean in this case. The deck facing said amazing scenery was as wide as my room (which was quite wide).

No pressure to buy drinks, but enough friendly staff to get drinks if we wanted them. I will start with the only negative issue: pool is very cold since it is mostly in the shade, but why go to a pool in the Caribbean when you can relax by the ocean, right? Positives: I will start by saying that all the staff in this hotel is very friendly. I have to specially mention JESSICA HERNANDEZ, Concierge Manager. This lady is tops, she was helpful, honest in guiding us to good restaurants, always smiling, remembering our names which made us feel important!!! Also I have to mention CARLOS, also at Concierge desk...what a great guy! Next, the buffet breakfast.... SONIA, our first server was right on top of everything, juice for the kids, coffee, omelets, etc. SONNY, now he is something else. I asked for warm milk and he prepared us cups of Puerto Rican coffee, with the boiled milk which was to die for. He really made our day... On our previous trip we had enjoyed the cream of corn that was served for breakfast. This year they only had oatmeal, which was unbelievably creamy and good. On the day previous to our leaving, one of the cooks was replenishing the oatmeal and I asked her about the corn meal. She asked me when we were leaving so she would tell LUIS to prepare it for us. Next day, not expecting to get it, I asked for LUIS. Sure enough, SONNY came out with two bowls of the most delicous corn meal ever. I was shocked, and soo happy. I gave SONNY a tip to give to LUIS and two minutes later LUIS came to our table to return the tip and say that he was only doing his job and what happy to be able to please us... WOW.... that is service! We must also thank JEFFREY who set up our lounge chairs and umbrellas at the beach every day. Nice helpful guy. And by the way, umbrellas and lounge chairs are free (I dont know why other people complain of having to pay). Our housekeeper, MARIA, was great. She kept our room clean, left us enough bottles of water every day in our room, and always had a big smile. And to cap it all, on the day we were leaving, the bell boy had loaded the suitcases in our taxi so my husband went to tip him and he told him \"your son already tipped me\".

Also - the surf was so bad that the waves would come up and cover at least half of the beach - like a mini tsunami. Also very odd. The area around the hotel, well, let's just say, this is no carribean island. While sitting al fresco in a nearby restaurant across from the the hotel, we would routinely see at least 8 police cars come up the street. I never felt very safe in this area.

No matter: promised pickups from the airport did not occur, and several responsibilities of the wedding planner were executed badly (gift distribution to guests' rooms) or not at all (wedding day schedule, location). Daily cleaning was spotty and used shampoos etc. were not replenished. A lush bath rug (not the skimpy mat) mysteriously disappeared and was not replaced until I called, two days in a row. Counters were not well cleaned, coffee tray left a mess. Wine glasses had to be called for, disappeared every morning and not replaced, policy I was told but that was unnecessarily inconvenient. Light outside closet was broken, had to make a call to repair it. A gaping hole in balcony where railing attached to concrete was just plain scary. That said, service staff always delivered with a smile, and one took 5 minutes to identify restaurants where locals eat. Overall, a big shock after the standards of service I've experienced in other Marriotts over three decades, for a Marriott just updated to make its lobby more upscale. City location part of the problem: to the right off the balcony was a great ocean view, but in front and to the left: miles of ugly grey concrete, fancy condos juxtaposed between unfinished and abandoned buildings and tourist memento stores. Why this location? And why so little local flavor? My biggest gripe about chain anything is they all might as well be in Bayonne, NJ. No attempt to provide atmosphere or local cuisine, even the hot sauce was standard tabasco, not the rich concoction with red pepper flakes and other flavors served in more authentic establishments.

I have traveled to PR several times and stayed in various properties, but this one takes the cake! The ride from the airport to the hotel via taxi was quite inexpensive ($16+$1 per bag) and while the scenic route to the hotel is not very scenic at all with all the grafitti, abandoned buildings and tiny roads, it was all worth it to arrive at this property. Keep in mind this is PR, not Beverly Hills so the neighborhood in which it sits looks run down, but don't let that distract you unless your that much of a stuffed shirt. We arrived and were greeted by the friendly doormen and security officers. We had to wait in line about ten minutes, but while we waited we sipped on some nice bubbly, yum. We had a brief encounter with a rude check in agent, but that wasn't going to distract our trip. The room was a city view and huge by PR standards. It had a nice crisp, clean look and the view was great. I am an extreme germaphobe and I have stayed in five star PR properties that don't hold a match to this room. I inspected the room thoroughly and I was pleasantly surprised by just how clean it was. The balcony was a nice touch to the room. The only issue we had was that our toilet was leaking and water was all over our floor in the bathroom, but within minutes maintenance was up to resolve this issue and apologized for the inconvenience. The property grounds were lush, the casino was small but nice and entertainment was loud and fun. The business center is a bit challenging to find, but they are opened 24 hours a day with employee at the desk to assist you. We slept like babies in our large queen/queen beds with comfortable pillows atop. There aren't many television stations, but who wants to watch tv in San Juan right? The next morning we ate the breakfast buffet and I am still dreaming about how delicious the food was. We sat out on the patio area so that we could look out to the private beach attached to the back of the hotel. Our waiter was very nice and the fruit was so fresh and delicious. The croissants and french toast required a second trip and the breakfast potatoes and sausage couldn't have been better. We were super sad that we didn't stay an additional night, but next time we will. There is a delicious burger spot across the street and cap it off with a scoop of ice cream from Haagen Dazs next door. If your going on a cruise, you may want to take a quick walk a block or so down from the property to the Walgreens to purchase those last minute items and it wasn't the average \"tourist\" Walgreen prices, it was aligned right with our average prices here in Chicago.

The checkin was easy enough, though a bit disorganized with no obvious line. The area between the checkin and the bar is a bit narrow, but it would still be nice to have some signage on where to queue when there is a line. I upgraded to the direct ocean front room and did not regret it. The room was forward facing directly on the ocean. The furnishings in the room were typical for a Marriott. The beach was very nice in December with plenty of space, chairs, and umbrellas. The surf was rough but great for body surfing and boogie boarding. There was a rather strong current so you need to be mindful to avoid the rocks or cement wall on either side of their beach. The pool has a great water slide. It could be a bit deeper to facilitate swimming laps. There is a poolside bar. It would be nice if the hotel rented beach equipment like boogie boards. The bar is very modern with dancing on the bar by attractive women a few nights a week. There was a dance floor there but the music was far too loud for anyone to actually dance. Standard drinks were crazy expensive. The quality of the mixed drinks was average and the variety of different alcohols was not extensive (more kinds of rum, more kinds of tequila needed). In terms of the meeting facilities, they seemed to be adequate for our workshop of about 120 people. There were a number of large meeting rooms and at least two workshops in parallel when we were there. For our meeting we had a reception, continental breakfast every day, private lunch in one of the restaurants, and a banquet one evening. The signage was not good so we had some people not attending our workshop at these events as well. The reception was especially overrun by other people at the hotel. It would be good for the hotel to be a bit more diligent about making sure random people don't show up at our events (having signs at a minimum indicating this is a private function). The food we had was average but perhaps was not the most expensive. The area around the hotel consists of other hotels, some older restaurants, and some newer restaurants. The area does not seem especially nice but did seem reasonably safe. I did not feel there were many authentic restaurants around.

You wait in line for the next available clerk, but a couple of people just walked up to clerks and started talking, etc. Those of us in line were not happy. The check-in process itself was quick and relatively painless. The room we had was a corner room with a bit more space - good as there were 4 of us. The room was very clean and all was in working order. The hotel is in the Condado area of San Juan, The area is undergoing a needed revitalization. We felt very safe walking around. Back to the hotel. The breakfast buffet in my opinion is not worth the money. The food is good, but for the buffet (no special orders), the cost is $15 / person. If you want the all inclusive (special orders and juices included) then the cost jumps to $24 / per person. If the variety of fruits, cheeses, breads, meats, and so forth was huge, then I would be happy paying the $$$, but it is not. Service was very good (Sonny) which made up for the mediocre food. The pool area is on the smaller side, but it is well maintained. The two pools are clean and nice. The beach by the hotel was fun. In the wintertime, the surf can be rough - so no young kids or inexperienced swimmers. But if you like to body surf or bogey board surf, you will have tons of fun. Overall, nice place to stay.

The previous three visits were romantic getaways. This time we were with our children and grandchildren. And it was as much fun as ever, albeit quite a different experience. The hotel is located on Condado Beach, a marvelous sandy shore ten minutes drive from Old San Juan. Lounge chairs, umbrellas are all included in the resort fee. The staff is as always cordial and accomodating in the hotel and on the beach. One is continually made to feel welcome. The oceanfront views are magnificent, and corner rooms have large balconies on two sides (Ocean front and Ocean and pool). The rooms are very well maintained, and towels replaced twice a day. The pools are immaculate, and the children's pool is unusually large with fountaints in the center. We never paid attention to it before, but with little grandchildren having a ball, we fell in love with it too. The hotel has a first-rate northern Italian restaurant and a very good Latin grill. Again, even in the fancy, upscale Italian restaurant, the staff is very welcoming to families with little ones, even as they are to adult couples. The Marriott has by far the best Latin dance bands of any hotel, and we have in the past stayed at three of what are considered the most luxurious in Puerto Rico. Friday-Sunday evening, many locals come in to dance -- a true indication of how really good the musicians are. Even when we stayed at other hotels (usually because the Marriott was booked solid, we went on weekend to dance there.) During our recent stay over American Thanksgiving, the lobby, including its bar (there are five others) and dance floor were undergoing major renovations which were nearly complete, so the dancing was moved into a small corner near the casino entrance, not as nice, but just a temporary solution till December 5. We were allowed to go behind the curtains to see the almost fully renovated dance floor and lobby, and they look gorgeous. The hotel is on Ashford, the main street of Condado, and is flanked by excellent restaurants for Asian, Italian and other cuisines. This is unlike the luxury hotels on Isla Verde or the golf resort hotels where one has to eat primarily in the hotel restaurants (although some of them are very good). In the outdoor park just two blocks down the street, there is a free jazz concert on the last Sunday evening of every month. Oh yes, and no less important, the prices at the hotel are quite reasonable for the high quality.

Furthermore, large chains usually have entire corporate divisions dedicated to ensuring that the experience is close to identical in each location, so what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the point of reviewing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seen one, seen \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel? Well, after my\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6uh, rustic experience in Culebra I was never so happy to land in a corporate hotel. I was surprised by the resort format, which I never associated with Marriott before this trip. Our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready when we arrived so Reception sent us off to the pool with two mini-bottles of rum and a can of Coke. The pool is huge but the deck is organically sectioned off into discrete, more private spaces. We passed right through it though, opting for the beach instead. Hotel employees set you up with complimentary lounge chairs and towels, and in no time at all a server approached us to see if we wanted cocktails or lunch. By the way, it is completely legal to drink alcoholic beverages on the beach in Puerto Rico. Any beach, anywhere, any time. Hey! We paid extra for an oceanfront corner king and it was worth it. The room was ginormous, with two terraces, floor to ceiling windows, and a bathroom with hot and cold running water! (You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to read my review of Tamarindo Estates in Culebra, PR to understand why the Marriott bathroom was a revelation.) The d\u00c3\u00a9cor is traditional, but not dated. In terms of amenities the hotel has a casino, restaurant, bar, concierge, and tour concession. We booked a tour of the El Yunque rain forest through the hotel and were very satisfied. The hotel is centrally-located relative to old San Juan, Ocean Park, and Isla Verde. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need a taxi to travel to and from old San Juan, which costs $15 +tip. The only negative I can think of is this: Condado beaches are somewhat narrow and all the hotel towers abut them tightly, casting long shadows on the very beaches they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to promote. All day long people are dragging their chairs this way and that to stay in the sun. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a shade person, this is good news for you. We walked down to the residential Ocean Park neighborhood beaches in order to get a full day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of sun. Only houses front the beach and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re set back from the beach a little farther than the hotels are. On the down side, there are no concessions on the beach so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to think ahead and bring your own food and drink with you. Bottom line: you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mistake Marriott for a boutique hotel (the building\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boxy exterior won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win any architectural awards) but you really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go wrong here, and you will be comfortable. If large-scale boutique chic is more your thing though, the new hotel on the block is La Concha, a few blocks away.

It has a great location, being at the half way point between the airport and Old San Juan, and is also close to some very fine restaurants in Condado. The hotel itself is right on the beach and has a lovely pool so you have the best of both worlds. The on site restaurants are terrific and the rooms are all well decorated and most importantly, sparkiling clean! The #1 reason we keep coming back to this hotel however, is not the location or the ammenities. It is the workers, in particular 3 of the wait staff at La Vista restaurant located in the hotel. Their names are Diana Ferenandez, Anthony Oquendo (Sonny) and Angelo Torres. These 3 particular individuals have been working at La Vista since our first visit in 1997, and although we can't afford to come back every year, all 3 employees remember us each time we visit and welcome us as if we were family with hugs and smiles and updates on all the goings on not only in the hotel and surrounding areas, but also in their personal lives. Because the hotel offers the buffet breakfast free with your stay every morning, we get to see Diana, Sonny and Angelo every day of our stay and they make sure that we are comfortable in every way. They go out of their way to seat us facing the ocean, (which my Mom loves), and to make sure we have anything we want made special by the chef. They also remember our individual preferences such as juice choice, who drinks decaf tea, who likes their coffee black, etc. They are EXCELLENT at their jobs and literally bend over backwards for you. More importantly, they take the time to talk with you, ask how you are doing, how the vacation is going and what you have done and seen so far. They are a pure delight and I believe that each one should be promoted to some position of management as they are exemplarary employees and fantastic role models.At this hotel, it is definitely the people that make the difference. On the downside, this time around we were disappointed with the lobby renovations not being completed on time as scheduled. At this particular hotel, the lobby is the lifeblood of the property. When the lobby was open in years past, every night was electrified with rotating live bands and dancing until the wee hours of the morning. Their beautiful bar was always packed and it was always great to just sit and relax and be entertained. Unfortunately, this time, the lobby was not only not done by their advertised completion date, but also didn't seem like it was anywhere near completion as you never heard workmen during the day and maybe you would see one or two workers at night. There is a \"quiet lobby\" that could have been converted to a bar and \"night club\" while renovations are being done (for the past few months!) but this was not the case. It seems amazing to me that the hotel would accept losing the nightly income that was generated by the dancing and bar service, but maybe I am thinking too profit mindedly. The only other complaint that I would voice about this property is that when something breaks in the pool area, like the hot tub, the accepted method of repair is to throw up some CAUTION TAPE and forget about it. This is what happened during our recent stay. After 4 days of being patient, we insisted on having our resort fee refunded, as my mother, who is in a wheel chair, really can only take advantage of the hot tub as opposed to the gym and the beach. We were initially refused the refund after being told that the resort fee included the use of other ammenities, But once I replied, \"like the lobby and live nightly music?\" we were refunded the resort fee and the hot tub was miraculously fixed within 20 minutes of that. I must say that the nice woman at the front desk was the unfortunate \"in between\" person as her manager never came out to speak with us directly, but she was very sweet and apologetic and did a great job at trying to keep us happy. I would also suggest that they paint their pool bar in more vibrant colors, especiallu \"under the roof\" where people tend to stare up and look while they are sitting at the bar. The bartenders shoudl also keep the fruit COVERED that they put into the tropical drinks as the uncovered fruit is not only unsanitary but also attracts a large amount of bees making it very dangerous for those of us who are allergic to bees and want to sit around the pool! Overall, I would highly recommend this property once their lobby is completed.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd coffee but my husband, who was wiped out the whole time from his shift the night before we arrived, burned a hole in his pocket there rather quickly :) The location also meant that we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t far from lots of things to do. San Juan in general has lots of family-friendly activities- in particular I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend El Morro, the pigeon park/Parque de las palomas (not for the faint of heart-- the birds are aggressive!) & walking around Old San Juan. These things are about 10-15 min drive from the hotel in our rental car- something I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d also recommend because you can explore other parts of the island if you have time. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really because we were looking for more of a restful vacation but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no shortage of things to do on the island. I had forgotten how interesting & varied Puerto Rico is since the previous time I had been there, and the island is pretty amazing if you have the chance to step outside of San Juan a bit. Back to the Stellaris- one thing to note is the beach isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spectacular, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little rough. But if you do decide to spend time at the beach, the staff is quite attentive. (One man in fact came by to fix my umbrella not one minute after I noticed how much it was leaning) Finally, the less than perfect beach is definately made up for by the pool. The pool was beautiful, big & relaxing, especially at nighttime. In fact this was my favorite part of the hotel & definately makes the Stellaris worth a visit. If I return to PR, I would stay here again for sure. On the whole, the setting was nice, the service was top-notch & the Stellaris left me with everything I wanted.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVacation in San Juan.\u201d", "Author": "lps773", "ReviewID": "UR121211463", "Content": "Jeanette Rivera at the bar is the best!

The same goes for breakfast. 2 breakfast's were included so we had to pay $20. for the buffet breakfast for my daughter and the food was not great. The French toast was hardened and the eggs were cold. They ran out of croissants. They gave us a bill for $65. and said the 2 complimentary breakfasts would be deducted from our bill. The bill also \"recommended\" numerical amounts for your tip of 15, 20 or 25% (on the entire $65.) - for a BUFFET! I do not mind tipping generously but the waiter only brought us coffee and water!!!! We also ordered burgers and chicken sandwiches at the pool. What an expensive mistake that was! The burgers were cold. If you wanted fries, it was $5. extra per sandwich.

From the friendly and helpful desk clerks, to the maids, wait staff and door man, everyone was polite and made us feel welcome. Our room was simply gorgeous, with a lovely balcony where we could overlook the city. The room was spotless, the bed so comfy that we ended up napping after our arrival rather than explore, and the bathroom elegantly appointed with a marble sink, and top drawer toiletries. The pool - just beautiful. So many different places to enjoy, the pool swim up bar, the fountains.. The beach was clean, and there were guards at the entrance to make sure that only people that were staying at the hotel could enter the hotel premises from the beach. It was very pleasant to sit outside having a drink sitting on comfortable couches around the fire pit. There was a small convenience store inside the hotel where you could buy various sundries as well as souvenirs. There is also a casino attached to the hotel.

It was clean, located right on the beautiful beach (with plenty of umbrellas for all the guests), a very helpful staff, and a good location to many restaurants, etc, We booked two rooms thru Expedia for our 5 family members. Our favorite \"find\" of the trip (as far as restaurants) is the Uno Restaurant located on the same street (Ashford Avenue) within walking distance from the hotel. If you are walking out of the lobby facing Ashford, take a left and walk less than 1/4 mile and you will see Uno on the left. They offer fabulous lunch specials daily, and were even open on Thanksgiving (check the back of the menu for the specials, all around 6.99-7.99, including the drink.). They have pizzas, burgers, pastas, salads, soups, etc. My son could only eat half his lunch portion, and we asked the Marriott staff to warm up his left overs that evening, which they gladly did...even putting it in a \"fancy\" plate, complete with silverware. Our favorite excursions of the trip...Spread Eagle II Catamaran snorkeling trip (check their website...they will pick you up from this hotel for about 12 dollars pp) which is located in Fajardo. EXCELLENT snorkeling...boat leaves daily from marina in Fajardo @10 and returns around 3:30. This Marriott has a friendly casino (the staff took the time to kindly tutor my son in the skills of Blackjack..offering helpful advice...he won $15 on his first (and only) try. Our Expedia deal had two free breakfasts (called the Sand Dollar package) included in the cost of the stay, per room, and the breakfast was exceptional (it's served in teh beautiful La Vista Restaurant located on the ground floor with windows overlooking the beach. There is a huge selection of food, which will keep you full for hrs. They do charge the gratuity to the room. Our Expedia deal also included internet charges. They explained to us when we checked in that the fee would be charged to the room (as was the price for the breakfasts) but would be removed at the time of checkout. Sure enough, on the last day, they slid a bill under our door in the morning and the only charges we had to our room were the gratuities for the breakfasts (around $6 for each of the 2 rooms) and the $20 charge per day for the valet parking. Trust me, if you rent a car like we did, it pays to spend $4 extra dollars a day for the valet parking as opposed to the self parking. You simply call down for your car to be delivered, and by the time you get down there, the car is ready. One word of advice...driving in Puerto Rico is really crazy. You need nerves of steel. The streets are narrow, and the bridge in and out of the Condado area includes an intersection (Ashford and 26) that is dangerous..not to mention the fact that every night the lights did not work at this intersection. 3 more tidbits: Try to take the WOW Jetski tour operating in the marina near the Sizzler Steak House (not more than a couple miles from this hotel...but you'll have to go thru this intersection I was telling you about)....also the WOW surfing lessons that operate from Isla Verde (my son and nephew did this...it was $50 for 1/2 hr lesson and 1 hr board rental) and you MUST see Old San Juan, especially El Morrow and the cobblestone streets. This Marriott is great. The pools are spectacular, and there are tons of lounge chairs around each of them, and plenty of room for every one. There is a relaxing hot tub, water slide, and access right to the beach. The beach is incredible, although the current is strong. However, you can still get in the water if you exercise caution...just don't go out too far. The lobby was under constuction and we were told that it would be completed in about 2 weeks.

The next day we took the bus back and when we were ready to leave, we sat for 45 minutes at the bus depot with many others waiting for the same bus. A local resident who had retired there from the mainland gave us a tip about a different bus (she said you could wait up to 2 hrs for the bus we took there). We took the M3 which was only 50 cents and it stopped about 4 blocks away from the hotel (nice walk back she was with us returning to her apt so she walked us in the right direction although would have been easy to figure out).

From the moment we were greeted with a warm smile and cold champagne, everything was fantastic. A nicely decorated, clean corner room with floor to ceiling windows with one side overlooking the city and the other side overlooking the ocean and balconies on both sides to enjoy - I was ecstatic. Room 923. The room was very large and the bed, pillows and linens were unbelievably comfortable. The property is well maintained, clean and great service and food, The pools are wonderful with waterfalls in both and lounge chairs everywhere. One is clearly for children by not being any deeper than I'd guess 3'. A cool slide winds around and lands in the other pool where there's a swim-up bar and built in plasma TV for football games! The area is beautifully landscaped too. There are fresh, warm towels at your disposal any time and there never was any shortage of them - even on the busy weekends. The moment my feet touched the sand, I was immediately greeted by an employee asking where I'd like to sit so he could set up lounge chairs exactly where I wanted. He also asked if I wanted an umbrella and dug a location in the sand for that too.There are tons of chairs and plenty of beach so no need to claim your spot early in the morning. There was always someone working the beach to provide drinks and food and they were prompt and friendly. If you are waited on by Pedro, you will enjoy a great smile and friendly conversation. The beach was clean and security at the hotel was always present - not that we ever had any incidences - but they were there to make sure of it, Police roam the beach, too, on an ATV to ensure everyone's safe and having a good time. The outdoors showers were handy for a quick rinse and steps away from the outdoor bar and several seating vignettes to enjoy the view of the ocean in the comfort of colorful couches and chairs. The only downside to the wonderful outdoor bar is the drinks are $10.50 in a medium sized Solo-style cup. And they weren't always generous with the liquor. It does add up quickly so we walked the 200ft to Walgreen's, bought our own booze and thermos/cooler and made our own drinks on the beach too. We also walked to the local market and bought some snacks and stuff which was convenient. The rooms have a fridge in them so we kept our goodies cold. The main restaurant, La Vista, had great buffets for each meal or we could order off the menu. The wait staff was really attentive and if you sit in Sonny's area, you're in great hands. There's another hotel restaurant that we didn't go to but looked nice and there's also a Starbucks in the lobby area for quick breakfasts or sandwiches. Restaurants directly across the street, an Italian one, is outrageously good and one to the right of it (and on the corner from Walgreen's) with yellow umbrellas has good food too. Walk further towards the Old San Juan direction and Casa Lola has fantastic food or across from Chili's is a restaurant called Ocean Hacienda Don something - which is a must. Walk all the way to the back and you're sitting at the ocean's edge and if the surf is up and strong trade winds blowing, don't be surprised if you catch a slight mist from the open windows. The food here is more Mexican than PR and it's good enough and the prices are very reasonable. The view is priceless. We hung out there long after our meal was over, just enjoying the tranquility. They have strong spotlights at night so the view is not lost when the sun goes down. My husband and I received a couples massage and the facility is nice but I will say we both had the same opinion of the quality of the massage. It wasn't bad, but we both felt their experience was mediocre. I'd get a massage there again but I'd go in knowing it won't be one of the best ones I've ever had. But hey, it was our 2nd day there and it helped take the edge of stress off from being over-worked!

The bathroom had Bath and Body shampoo, conditioner and lotion, which I love. Water pressure in the shower was strong. Towels were large and soft. The pool is beautiful. Two sections - one better for families with a slide. The other side a nice swim up bar! The beach is wide with soft sand and chairs and umbrellas. Options for everyone! Food is pretty good as are the drinks. The excursion desk offers variety. Unfortunately for us, the rainforest never opended because of he hurricane. Try the kayaking, ziplining and horseback riding. The biolumenescece bay is worth the experience. I was afraid it would be cold at night but was pleasantly surprised. The area is more city than we would have liked but if you are looking for night life this is certainly the place. Staff was always helpful and cheerful.

We ultimately picked the Marriott because we got an ocean front balcony for the same price as a city or pool view at either of the other hotels. This Marriott is a solid 4 and I'll break it down for you. We're in our 20's and we were definitely missing some more evening activities/clubs/etc. within the hotel. The casino felt very separated from the hotel and was 95% slots and a few table games. 2 blackjack tables, 1 roulette, 1 craps, and maybe 2 poker tables. Yes, the lobby was under construction and they said it would be opened around 11/18/11... I'm not in construction, but that seemed ambitious. The hotel could very well get a five star rating once the lobby is done because right now there is huge void in the hotel. Cleanliness was spot on... No pun intended. Very clean, I didn't feel grossed out at any point and the room servicing was quick and consistent. The bathrooms are typical for any commercial hotel and have a few spots of concern, but I'm not overly sensitive to those things. The room... Was great. The bathroom was entirely too small. We had an oceanfront balcony so I was expecting a slightly nicer bathroom for $200+/night. It was one of those bathrooms that you can't open and close the door and do anything else at the same time. The room was typical and a nice size. The room also lacked drawer storage... Yes. Only two drawers! There was a TV console but it had a fridge and k-kup coffee maker in it. The location was great for beach front access and it was close to a Walgreens and plenty of restaurants around. You can walk up and down the streets with minimal threats/worries and most of the restaurants are very welcoming to tourists. The service was ok for what we used. The concierge sent us to a restaurant called Bar Gitano which was \"reasonable\" but we found very expensive. We booked a tour through the hotel and they were accommodating but also slightly pressuring us into doing it. Every tour was \"almost sold out\" and when we did the tour, there were plenty of spaces available. Pool leaves some things to be desired. There are way too many trees around and the hotel and the sun set quickly so there was minimal sun bathing. The pool in the picture with all of the fountains is extremely misleading; that pool is about 1 1/2 feet deep all around and is an oversized kiddie pool. The lower pool was nice, but the waterslide drew a lot of kids in. We didn't eat at the hotel, but can recommend and offer guidance towards places to eat off the resort. 1. Bar Gitano - authentic, but overpriced and spent $120+ on dinner and left hungry; however live flamenco dancing on Sundays. 2. Green House restaurant - good, quick, cheap. 3. Raices - got the mufungo as we were told to, and it was good, but overrated and again expensive ($40 for lunch). 4. Latin Star - awful, disgusting, terrible...5. Pinky's - great breakfast for reasonable money... In hindsight we should have eaten there a few more times. FYI - Walgreens down the street had your typical goodies, so load up on beer, water, and soda to take to the beach. Would I recommend it? I would for the value of the oceanfront balcony, but I personally wouldn't stay there again. If you are ok with a non-oceanfront room, I heard from friends on the cruise that the El San Juan was awesome despite the reviews which turned us away from it. Also, the ocean at the Marriott had very rough waters and the El San Juan had, much calmer waters (so we heard). Different strokes for different folks.

Amazingly the buzzer went off 45 minutes later, this was around 11.15am and our room was ready - fantastic, they certainly didnt have to give us a room so early but it was very much appreciated. After we briefly unpacked (only were the staying the 1 night unfortunately) we heaed down to the baech - it is classed as a local beach but the Marriott had most of it right in front of their hotel. There were 4 beach attendants greeting you and getting you your free sunbeds and umbrella - they situated them anywhere you wanted, which was fantastic. There is also a beach waiter from the hotel that comes around asking if you want any drinks or food - what a great service. The sea is rather choppy (some moderate waves) but the sand is glorious and very clean. There is very good hotel security on the beach and at the hotel entrance to the beach ensuring no non guests try to get into the hotel resort and use the facilities. The pool area is fantastic also with plenty of sun loungers spread put the whole area. All of the pool and beach towels were free too and you could replensish as often as you wanted.

The bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel offers free beach chairs, umbrellas and towels. The beach and pool area was nice and clean. We booked a city view room but used my Marriott reward points to upgrade to an ocean view room. I highly advise you reserve or upgrade to an ocean view room. There is nothing like waking up to a view of the ocean. The lobby was still under renovation but that didn't ruin the trip or cause any problems. I highly recommend the following restaurants, Monas, Greenhouse, The Ambassador, Di Parma Trattoria (my favorite) and Mike's pizza. There is also a Wendys, Starbucks (directly across the street) and Dunkin Donuts within walking distance of the hotel. Venture out and try the food at the local restaurants versus eating at the hotel restaurants. There was a high police presence on Ashford Avenue so we always felt safe except for one morning while eating breakfast at the Latin Star, a lady had her purse snatched in the parking lot across the street.....There is a Walgreens one block away from the hotel. You can save money by buying your snacks, liquor and beer from there. Here goes the cons...you cannot use cash at the pool or beach bars. You have to charge everything to your room.

This is an older hotel that has been a Marriott upgrade. I was in the West (on the left looking at the ocean) smaller tower. The rooms were very nice,and spacious (I got a $25 upgrade to a corner room- well worth it). The beach was fine and the pool was actually big enough to do laps when it wasn't crowded...how often does that happen? There'sa swim up bar, lush landscaping, music and very cool lights that illuminate the grounds and buildings after dark. The only negative was there was only one hot tub which was always crowded. The lobby is currently under construction, but no big inconvience. I received 1,000 extra points because of it. There is a starbucks across the street and some good resturants within a block or two. I asked for some free drink coupons at check in and that gladly give me a few.

The main lobby is under construction and the check-in area is very cramped with a very narrow traffic area. We were offered a welcome drink, but it never arrived. The front desk staff was very polite and professional and directed us to the bellhop to store our luggage while our room was being readied. If you plan to arrive at this hotel early, make sure your swimsuit is easily accessible, as you can enjoy the beach or pool as you wait for your room to be ready or you can relax and have a drink outside. We were supposed to receive a call when our room was ready, but that never came either, so we checked in at the front desk again around 4pm and our room was ready and the bags were delivered promptly.

The public transportation was not available when we were there; due to a strike. A cab ride to Old San Juan and the Cruise Ship Port varied from $16-$19 one way. The wedding had to be held indoors due to a violent thunderstorm accompanied by torrid rain. I was very disappointed in the arrangements for the indoor contingency plan. Although nothing can mar a beautiful couple on their most important day, the hotel had prepared the room for the ceremony by sectioning off a portion of a conference room and draped what appeared to be a big sheet as a backdrop. Contrast this next to the bride's elegant 4 feet tall vases with pink submerged orchids and you can envision how tacky this looked. Surely this was not the first time this hotel had to arrange an alternative to the outdoors. However, the reception was beautiful, the staff was very accommodating and the food was delicious.

We also had dinner at the italian pizza place down the road, next to Tijuanas, and that was shockingly delicious (and we are 2 New Yorkers that know good pizza!). We were supposed to go to Tijuanas but did not want to wait so we decided to go there. The location was very convenient being right across from Starbucks and Walgreens. Housekeeping also re-stocked your room each day with bottles of water which I thought was a great addition. You can also pick up bottles of water for free at the front desk. This was without a doubt the best hotel experience I have ever had and will most definitely return here when I come back to San Juan!", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "sintia", "ReviewID": "UR119160981", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel back in January and wasn't really impressed with the hotel.

The Marriott Hotel was perfect for us, as I live in New York, my brother came from Texas and my sister recently moved to Florida. So staying together gave our families a chance to bond and grieve together under one roof. The hotel is presently under some form of expansion though we were not aware of any type of construction noise and we were told they would be completed by November 2011. All the staff were friendly and helpful. And our rooms were a nice size and immaculately cleaned. My sister and brother in law stayed in one of the beautiful penthouse suites with a beautiful ocean view balcony. Truly luxury and we did get to enjoy it as well though we stayed in a more moderately priced room. The swimming pool and jacuzzi was open early and closed at 11PM which was great to be able to stop by after a late evening for a swim or a soak. Also the beach was right there. The restaurants were enjoyable and if you wanted to step away from the hotel there were plenty of places to have a coffee or a great meal. DiZucchero right accross the street was a wonderful restaurant where we enjoyed two of our late meals. Accross from the hotel is Starbucks and a few streets down we found this little restaurant called Orozco that offered a wonderful breakfast from 8AM to 3PM with delicious spanish coffee as well as other great dishes.

The rooms are typical Marriott, nothing special, but clean and updated. The pool area is very nice with plenty of seating and a great pool bar. The beach area is fantastic and that's where we spent most of our time. The hotel provides nice beach chairs and umbrellas and there is food/drink service on the beach as well. The beach itself is considered public, but I didn't see any non-hotel guests, and if there were any, it wasn't a problem. A few times jewelry and ice-cream vendors came by, but they weren't intrusive or rude. We had the buffet bkfst inclued in our room. A good deal since the buffet for 2 is $40. If you are paying for it separately, not sure it's a great deal unless you are a huge eater. The lobby is currently being renovated, but honestly, I didn't pay much attention and don't consider it a drawback. I never heard any noise and everything is covered up. I'm not paying to stay in the lobby anyways. The beach bar is a good place to sit back and have drink. The bar menu is very average, but in the evenings, they will serve off the menu from the inside restaurant, which is much much better. We tried all the ceviches on that menu and they were all delish. The empanadas and tostones were also tasty, we had them several times throughout our stay. One thing we noted was the amount of security on the property as well as the surrounding area. Twice daily a police heli flew over along the beach, a police vessel sailed along the coast and Police ATV's patrolled the beach. Additionally, police presence was very strong along Ashford Ave. We heard that there had been muggings but to be honest, we felt safe each time we went out (maybe due to the police presence?)", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOvervalued price\u201d", "Author": "DiamondSuave", "ReviewID": "UR118925704", "Content": "Our first room from an older section in the hotel and smells that way.

From our perspective, it is all about how resorts treat those of us who are indeed physically challenged. One can glean helpful tips from our experience for if we are treated well and with helpful compassion, one can bet the average healthy traveler will be as well. Our travel dates to San Juan where September 19-25th. We used Delta Airlines to fly, and, they were fantastic! Flights were on time, handicap wheelchair assistance was provided with a smile, and, we were indeed pre-boarded. Thank you Delta, we could not fly any other way! Your gate staff were marvelous, and, the flight crews very accommodating and supportive. Once we arrived, we hired a taxi from the airport to the hotel. You will be given a slip of paper with the prices for the fare listed. The driver spoke no English, and, we spoke no Spanish! Yet somehow, we managed to communicate and had a nice drive. Check in at the Marriott was with a smile, very quick, the hotel amentities were explained, our keys given and boom, up to the room we went! The Bellman took our luggage, gave us a ticket and quickly brought our bags and gave us a room indoctrination. We had an oceanfront room, on the 19th floor (Room 1914) and the views were gorgeous. Housekeeping did a spectacular job daily to keep our room tidy and well supplied. Thank you Joiceylyn, your efforts made our stay memorable. Please folks, remember to tip the staff for jobs well done!! There was no request that we made on the housekeeping level that was not met. The room had two double beds, very nice linens, plenty of towels, a small fridge, a room safe, large bathroom, a working desk, bath robes, and, patio. Every day, you are left two bottles of water in the bathroom. Should you desire more, they are quick to bring them to you! Yes, the carpet was a bit worn in places, but, I would notice only because we walk with canes, and, tend to look at the flooring. In my book, it was just a few \"love foot prints\" left behind by travelers of the past! Get ready to exercise your arm muscles, for the doors are heavy to open and push! Good security feature. Now to the beach...yes, you do pay for the umbrellas, beach chairs, towels. It is pro-rated daily. We only used the service on Wednesday, so I was a bit concerned about paying $84 dollars. Frankly, it would behoove the Marriott just to put such a bill in with the room rate and be done with it all. Saves a lot of barking by clients and frayed nerves by other clients! The men who carry out the chairs and dig the sand around the umbrella were prompt and courteous. One can imagine the flack and fire they hear about this charge daily! I was merely happy that my umbrella did not blow over on top of us! This is not your typical Caribbean beach. It is Atlantic Ocean waters, with the surf line taking a small dip down, as the waves come crashing into shore. As we say in SCUBA diving, a lot of \"white water\". For stronger swimmers, or surfers, or those who have had a few to many cocktails, the effortt seemed to be worth it for the clients who ventured out. Everyone there seemed to be very happy! The beach area was immaculate, being cleaned daily. We navigated down the steps with our canes and on to the beach. I did not see a ramp for wheelchair access, but, perhaps I missed the same. The pool is divided into two areas: one for sunning and a quick dip and one for swimming/splashing about near the pool slide and bar. The water was crystal clear and clean. Plenty of towels that you can exchange for dry ones. The pool bar was active and there was a young lady taking orders for food and drinks. While there are no umbrellas about the pool, you can find shade at any time of the day. Temps were about 90-92 degrees during our stay. Needless to say, we stayed by the pool for most of the trip, venturing in with our canes to the amusement of the other guests! There is music playing, but, not so blaring that it interrupts a good book or a nap on the chair. There is easy access to the pool area for folks utilizing wheelchairs or canes. Money exchange in Puerto Rico is of course, our USA dollar. Meaning, things are a bit pricey. Food in particular, alcohol as well. There are several dining options offered at the hotel: pool snack shack, the daily buffett for breakfast which switches to sit down dinners, and, the gorgeous Italian restaurant. Outside of the casino there is the coffee bar, which offeres light fare, donuts etc. Inside the casino, beginning at six at night is a \"Noodle Bar.\" Imagine my surprise when they brought out this soup toureen size bowl just for me!! No way could just one person finish it! I recommend trying the noodle bar, and, sharing the choices between two people! My Mother ordered the sweet and sour shrimp, and, out came fried rice, brocolli, and 12 huge shrimp! You will not leave hungry. Since it is inside of the casino, the noise level is a bit higher for dining. Stop by the Concierge Desk, on the computer are listed the menus for the restaurants. It gives you a quick look at what is offered and the prices. I would like to commend the wait staff and Chef Cesare Biancalana of the Ristorante Tuscany. It is a dining experience not to be missed during your stay! There is a difference between eating and fine dining, and, you will experience a masterful display of culinary artwork should you book a reservation! Have you ever seen such wonderful combination on a plate that actually mimick artwork? If not, they go and see what Chef Cesare has in store for you!! His personal touches are seen everywhere, and, this is a gentleman who not only is a rare talent, but, is very available to the clients in the dining area. There was no request to small or to large that was not tended to with smiles and expediency. The dessert coffees are decadent, the cakes sinfully guilty!! Thank you one and all for making these two ladies feel so pampered and special! We remain, truly grateful. Yes, we did order up room service twice. And twice were not disappointed with our selections. There are times when ladies just do not want to dine out, rather we girls prefer our nighties and a lighter evening meal! The Staff took our orders quickly, and, the food arrived within about a half an hour. Stellar service! Again, we remain so grateful. Nothing like feeling right at home with a good meal, and, a tv until it was time to dress to visit the casino for the evening! The Casino was open 24 hours a day. There are slot machines, don't forget to check out the back room on the left hand side for the nickel and penny slots, there are the \"tables\", and, very capable dealers. I did see ID's being checked, and obnoxious folks being politely escorted out. Drinks are offered, and the Cashiers are quick with your cash outs. Since we do not stay up late, we were usually out of the casino by ten at night. Local people come to play, guests from other hotels arrive as well. It can be \"cheek to cheek\" if you get my meaning! We never felt threatened, for there is the Security prescence that is prominent and active. Speaking of Security, we did have a small incident that arose. I reported it to the Evening Front Desk Manager who quickly sent up Carlos Nay and Lorraine Smith to take our deposition and calm our nerves. Their level of professionalism and capacity to navigate the situation was quickly apparent. The incident was resolved and the conflict quickly tended to by the Marriott and Staff. Having traveled now to 59 countries over my many years of traveling, I have always felt that it is not the problem that ruins a vacation/holiday, but, rather how the hotel management and staff handle the same. The Marriott San Juan Team was well prepared, knew precisely what was required by whom, and, resolved the incident to our satisfaction. Mr. Nay and Ms. Smith checked on us several times afterwards, always with great compassion and concern for our needs. Truly a remarkable pair of employes who deserve nothing but the best that life could offer them. Thank you again Carolos and Lorraine, you and your families remain in our hearts and prayers. The Security Team does their job to the utmost, and, tries to remain inconspicuous as possible. Trust the Marriott Security Team, they are on the job 24/7! There is a car rental desk, which, we did not utilize during our stay. Don't think my nerves could handle San Juan traffic and the highways! There is also a very knowledgeable and helpful Tour Desk, right around the corner from the Front Desk. We booked the combination tour of Baccardi Rum Factory, Fort of San Cristobel, and, Old San Juan. Not to high a price, $69 for about five and a half hours out on tour. The desk is most helpful, stop by and have your tour needs met. Lots to choose from! Our Tour Driver was \"Harry\" and we could not have asked for a better guide! Humerous, knowledgeable, courteous, and prompt. While out and about, we took note of a high Police prescence, crime seems to be a problem, perhaps more so around tourist areas. My advice is simple: use common sense, do not travel alone, and, be mindful of which area you are finding yourself. We did some shopping in Old San Juan. History and beautiful archieture abounds, so go and see what is out there! If you are physically challenged, the Fort does have handicap access and an elevator. Now, we did not make it to the higher levels, but, were quiet content to stroll about the plaza area, the gift shop, the tunnel. The Tour Desk can advise you which tours are more arduous for the elderly/handicapped. There is time to eat a lunch downtown, and, we enjoyed our fare! We were pooped upon our return! Job well done Harry, you are the best! The Tour Desk does offer brochures and maps for the more adventurous. If you run out of something, or have little time to shop at the Plaza Las Americanas Mall or in Old San Juan, there is a small gift shop next to the Front Desk. Also, tucked away, out of sight, down a bit from the elevators, before the banquet hall, is a young lady selling local crafts off a cart in a small anteroom! Stop by and see her, she is lovely and has such wonderful items for sale! We did indeed walk down the block to the Walgreens for some snacks and Coke, all I can say is it is not the Walgreen's back home! But, you can save a few bucks over resort prices. I toss a few snack items into my suitcase that I check, and, then have them for the beach or pool area. Some people have complained about the elevators. There were four elevators that ran all the time, so I cannot way that I understand their complaint. They were all in working order during our stay, complete with new carpeting! Yes, they are indeed redoing the Lobby area. But the noises was not that offensive. I believe they hope to complete the work before the end of November. The Bell Hop/Doormen staff were informative, knowledgeable, courteous, and on the ball. Good job guys keep up the good work! I did take note of the parking garage for those of you who desire to rent a car for the week. Sadly, I have no knowledge of the parking fees. With regard to \"Local Restaurants\" there are several in the area that are reasonable, and, offer a myriad of cuisine choices. Check the taxi fares prior to getting into the cab. The \"Check Out\" process is painless at the Marriott San Juan. You can keep a tally by viewing your folio on the tv. We did the express check out, left our keys on the table in the room and were on our way at six in the morning. My bill was complete and accurate. Well done Accounting/Billing Department! My recommendation is to keep all of your receipts for the rare incidents that you may have to question a charge on your bill. If there is a problem with your bill, upon arrival home you are accorded a phone number to use to resolve the same. To date, my credit card was only charged with what we ordered for meals and the beach/umbrells service. We left San Juan on an early Delta flight, at night in the morning. The Taxi Driver who carried us to the airport was on the ball, getting us to the Delta check in area. They do require you to stop, and, proceed to the USDA area where your bags are scanned PRIOR to you going to your airline gate check in!! This was a new experience for us, and, once your bags are scanned they are tagged as such. We played by \"the rules\" and were at the gate two and a half hours prior to take off. Since we are pre-boarded, we wanted to be where we needed to be and not hold up the other passengers. To those who are considering the Marriott San Juan Resort as a possible destination, you will not be disappointed. Should you encounter any problems during your stay, please, give the Staff an opportunity to assist you and resolve the situation. So many travelers return home dissatisfied or angry about issues that could have easily been resolved by the Staff if they were given a chance!! So, go, have a fantastic time at the Marriott and come home with many endearing memories. We certainly did! Thank you to the Marriott Staff for making our stay one for the memory books!

It was wonderful having a tour desk in the lobby, which was very helpful in booking our zip line adventure (highly recommended). My husband enjoyed the casino. We've never been to a casino where they will let you eat at the card tables! On Friday night, they had the best live musical trio - puerto rican music to makes you want to dance! I do agree with a previous poster that it would have been nice to have that kind of music at the pool, rather than zen music, but that is a personal preference. Everyone that we had contact with was so helpful, polite, and friendly. One instance I wanted to mention, our granddaughter misplaced her cell phone. We called the front desk to ask if anyone had turned one in, but no luck. We immediately went down to the pool area to check if it was there, and security was already there looking for it! The security guard even helped me look thru the dirty towel bin to see if it had been mistakenly thrown in there. I call that above and beyond!! The only complaint I can think of, is that there is a \"wet, musty\" smell in the room, but that is to be expected in a beach front hotel in a humid climate. Simple solution...there is a Walgreens one block down the street, and we purchased a can of scented Lysol, and sprayed the room down a couple of times a day. Problem solved!! The food was traditional hotel food, on the expensive side, but the tropical atmosphere made it worthwhile. We did the breakfast buffet every morning, and our last night splurged on a good meal at La Vista. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to San Juan.

Equipment was in great shape and there is another area for floor exercises. The pool areas were in great shape as well with plenty of seating. One day I requested a lounge/shading for the beach area. I saw people with dogs running the beach and there were lots of birds so I preferred the pool area. Also, there is a run off from the street on the left side of the beach. Husband was on business so we would go to PH floor for breakfast and munchies in the evening. One night there was a gathering for frequent Marriott customers which was nice. I had a couple of glasses of red wine and when I went back to the room I discovered my mouth was purple. Ha. One afternoon I was sitting under the shaded pool bar and discovered that they have activities throughout the day. Staff began bingo sessions so I joined in a won a free drink. Drinks are around $10.00 and they aren't that great. Happy Hour is between 4 - 6. It's cheaper to drink on the PH floor if you have access and drinks are better. On a side note we ate room service most nights which was OK. There is a Wal-Greens across the street for snacks and I'd suggest buying beer/drinks there. Met a couple in the lobby that paid a cab $60.00 roundtrip to Old San Juan. There is a bus stop on the right exit of the Marriott so for three quarters you can save yourself some money and it took us less than 20 minutes for a whopping $3.00 roundtrip. There is a free trolley in OSJ and don't forget to stop by Don Q for some free rum samples. The forts are in walking range if you don't want to wait for the trolley. Can attend both for $5.00 or $3.00 for one and don't step in the poop (it's not dog and I'll let you figure that one out).

For breakfast you HAVE to go to Pinkys (make left out of hotel, 3 or 4 blocks down on the left next to starbucks). For lunch try anything and for dinner you MUST have Buena Verde (I think). Its real close to the hotel, make left out of hotel, accross the street one block down. Kinda pricy but you wont be disappointed. Back to the hotel; it was clean, recently renovated, modern, NICE pool and jaccuzi, real clean beach and nice staff. What more do you need. You gotta go to Old San Juan. Oh yeah, the drinks at the hotel were real expensive. make sure you get wasted during happy hour or buy your liquor outside and bring back to the room.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Easton, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat unexpected stay\u201d", "Author": "Susan C", "ReviewID": "UR118165101", "Content": "We booked this hotel the night before a cruise.

We got a room upgrade- 19th floor overlooking the ocean and free wi-fi. We also got a late checkout which allowed us extra time to swim and clean up before our flight. Mike's pizza delivered and we ate in the temporary lobby while wating to checkout. The beach has chairs and umbrellas free of charge- they set up where you choose. A pleasant security guard monitors the beach what appears to be 24 hours (children are only allowed on beach with adults). Only one man walked along the beach selling necklaces but was non intrusive. The women at the desk were not only courteous but helpful in their restaurant and siteseeing recommendations. Had the best calzone at Mike's Pizza but there are so many good restaurants along the strip. We felt safe walking along with our children, day or evening. There were many police officers standing along and driving the strip. There is a Walgreens, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and at least 10 restaurants within several blocks. The bus is 75 cents per person to Old San Juan so we took a day trip in there and had an excellent meal at EL Dente, a recommendation of the hotel staff. We only ate one dinner at hotel, good but not excellent. There were so many other choices. We did not use the casino, tours or garage so cannot rate. I would stay here again and recommend it.

Security was very present, so we always felt safe. The restaurants were good and there was plenty to choose from. Many people we met were visiting from nearby hotels because the Marriott was so much nicer. But most of all it was the incredibly professional staff who made our stay so special. From our arrival, we were always greeted with such warmth and hospitality, we soon felt we had a home away from home.

It was a last minute getaway and we enjoyed every minute of it. We landed early and we were crossing our fingers that we would be able to check in as we were quite tired from the trip. Check in was a breeze and they had a room available for us so it was good. They gave us free champagne while we were checking in. The hotel was pretty good, there is construction going on but you never hear it or see it as they covered the section with a curtain. They have a kiddie pool and another one for bigger kids/grownups. That pool isn't too deep so no diving was allowed. There is a slide which was fun for both kids and grownups. They also have a swimup bar which was good. The pool service was super slow, though, as well as at the beach. However there were some exceptional staff members I need to mention (and you should ask for them!): Richard at the beach who always greets us with a friendly smile every morning and will bring our umbrella and chairs no matter how far we want and Angelo at breakfast who is the best server! The beach is amazing in the morning, and you should definitely go and grab a good spot by the water. The waves were pretty crazy but the water is warm and blue and beautiful. The hotel is in a very good location: starbucks across the street, walgreens 2 blocks away, loads of restaurants within walking distance. Definitely try Perla restaurant inside La Concha Hotel. Amazing ambience and views and the food is delicious! Worth the splurge. The hotel is also only 10 mins away from Old San Juan and only 75 cents via bus. Try the restuarant Bura if you do make it to Old San Juan, the food is delicious and the mojitos are the best. Also there is a cool store called Pina Colada that is walking distance from the hotel-- very cool stuff. All in all the hotel was enjoyable, and clean-- and kid friendly. The music wasn't obnoxious all day but they do have a DJ around 5pm or 6pm. Only complaint would be the resort fee and they don't have free wi-fi so you'd have to pay $19 for wifi!

We were at the hotel for about 18 hours. We made the most out of our 18 hours though, and got to experience the Tuscany restaurant for dinner, La Vista Restaurant for breakfast, Casino, business center, and walked the entire property, including pool area. We arrived to the hotel at about 8:00. I had just booked the room about 3 hours earlier because we were leaving St. Thomas a day early because of an approaching storm. Upon checkin, I asked if we could get the Escape Package rate which was $20 more than our current rate, but included breakfast for 2 people daily. Because I had literally just booked the hotel 3 hours before arriving, I figured it would be no problem. I was wrong. The person checking us in said he would need to check with his manager, who told him they could not do it. I pressed a little bit as to why, at which time he blatantly lied and said it required a two night stay. I of course had to call him on this, because how would I have known about the package if it hadn't come up during my attempting to book my one night stay. He went back into his managers office, came back out about 3 minutes later and said they were working on it, then came back out again a couple minutes later and said they could do it. This was not the best start to my time here, because I stay at Marriott's relatively frequently, as far as vacationers go, and had never had one of their employee's flat out lie to me. We then went to dinner at Tuscany's, and had a wonderful meal with a great server, great food, and great wine. It wasn't the cheapest meal ever at $109 before tip, however it was absolutely worth it. We then went to the casino where we dumped all of our allotted gambling money in about 15 minutes and went upstairs to go to bed. We ate breakfast at La Vista's the next morning, and they had a pretty good buffet. they had an omelet station, but instead of standing there and waiting for your omelet to get done, your waitress brought it to you when completed. This was a nice touch. We asked for late check out because we really didn't have to leave until 2:00, and were given 1:00 pm checkout instead of 12:00 checkout, which was a little disappointing. We went to the casino again that morning at which time I was a little surprised to be asked to remove my hat. It was 11:00 in the morning, and other people in the place were allowed to wear the proverbial \"do rag\", but I had to remove my St. Thomas hat. Now mind you I wasn't dressed \"gangster\", and was sporting my best tourist outfit of the Tommy Bahama island shirt, short's and sandals. We then called the bell service to get our luggage, who was truly incredible. They were incredibly nice, talkative, and very informative about the island and helping us with any questions we had. The Marriott gave me mixed emotions. The tipped employees were very good, ready to serve, and understood their salary was based on their ability to be service oriented. Unfortunately the rest of the staff didn't share this attitude, and seemed to not really care whether we were happy with our stay or not. If I return to San Juan, and I plan to, I will not stay here.

No such luck. After getting our handheld buzzer we languished in their outside restaurant until AFTER check in time, despite checking in with Ileana at 3:30 about our room.

As long as your bag is unobtrusive, which ours were, I don't see why any Casino should turn you away.

However, the hotel staff entirely was terrible, unprofessional and at the end of the day had the \"I do not care\" attitude that should NEVER be had at a hotel. The worst part was the Concierge who we spoke to regarding going out to an island on the west side of Puerto Rico, we were willing to drive or take the puddle jumper flight out there, we did not care and had done our research enough to know that this was where we wanted to take a day trip to. The concierge \"highly\" recommended that we not go as was incredibly touristy and had long lines. He instead recommended that we go to a beach on the east side of PR where the waters had 7 different colors and was just \"spectacular\" and much easier to get to. Unfortunately we arrived at a trash filled, overrun dump of a beach in an unsafe part of PR (which we later found out) after wasting a total of 4 hours in the car, 2 hours on the phone with a number of unhelpful, uncaring Marriott staff members we arrived back at the hotel. When we asked to speak with the manager, we were directed from person to person, yet again. At the end of the day, we wound up talking with a woman who said she was the manager, we had wasted an entire day and then found out on the next day, that she was actually just a front desk associate and not the manager after all. It is this lack of care, couth and decent customer service that makes me never want to go back to the Marriott again.

The guy swiped my friends card several times, saying that the first swipes didn't go through. Turns out he charge $1500 to my friend's card and AmEx put a hold on the account. It took forever to resolve with the hotel, they charged her card and didn't want to give her all of the cash back (the front desk guy didn't write a receipt or note on the account that we put cash on the room). When we first walked into the room and it smelled a little moldy, but we figured we just needed to turn on the air conditioning and everything would be fine. We were placed in a handicapped room, which wouldn't have been a problem had the plumbing been okay. Anytime one of us took a shower water would go everywhere; there was no incline in the shower to have the water run towards the drain. The next day we called the front desk about this and we were forwarded to about 4 different people until we finally landed with one of the \"managers\". Long story short it turns out the water was leaking onto the carpet, got some of our luggage wet (because there were no luggage racks) and \"management\" was extremely slow to do anything. We had to deal with several different people that called themselves managers but couldn't do anything. What really bothered us was that this was the level of service they gave to a Platinum rewards member, afraid of what would have happened had we not had any status.

One night, we and other customers waited literately 10 minutes for the elevators. We were told they were \"rebooting\" the system..what does it means?

A dish that Looked somewhat like a German potato salad turned out\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto my delight\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto be yuca en escabeche with crumbled bacon. There were other salads with a delicious light curry sauce, but I wasn't able to find out what it was. I sampled a couscous salad, and a yummy quinoa salad with tangy feta. There were two green mixed salads with various dressings and eight or more toppings. And chewy whole-grain dinner rolls topped with sunflower seeds; I would have been capable of making a meal out of these alone! I enjoyed a plaintain soup that had several layers of complex flavor that usually aren't in a sopa de pl\u00c3\u00a1tano; I thought I could identify beef stock and Worchestershire sauce. The main courses included a flavorful eggplant lasagna, chicken breasts with caper sauce, swordfish en escabeche, and pork loin with chimichurri sauce. The meats and the fish were a little dry but flavorful. Pacing myself was imperative. The lively conversation was a welcome respite from overfilling. The topics were social media, technology and the social dynamics of cyberspace, they were as good a match as a dry wine to complement the high-protein main dishes. Dessert beckoned. \"Try meeeeee!\" pleaded each one of the fifteen to twenty desserts laid out in two tiers. While many call, few are chosen, by necessity. I reluctantly passed up several cakes, cookies and tarts, rice pudding, tembleque, casquitos de guayaba, dulce de papaya. Opting for a thin slice of berry pie, half a slice of chocolate cheesecake and a tiny tartlet, I made my way back to the table. The berry pie was rich and fruity, and the crust was thoughtfully thin. \"Un cortadito,\" a cup of delicious, freshly-brewed top-quality Puerto Rican coffee with just a little hot milk, gave the perfect final touch. The bottom line: La Vista has one of the more complete lunch buffets that you will find in San Juan.

You set the thermostat temp 9) The \"red flag\" on the beach for the surf is almost always red (a liability issue) 10) expect multiple weddings/parties on weekends ( that's typical) 11) we never ate in the hotel (except breakfast cereal/milk/fruit we had purchased 12) The reservation/check in system- very \"third world.\" What is this? we booked a biz/superior room, corner. (I think $269.00 on the marriott res web site + I called to confirm). Upon checking in it was whatever was left. They stuck us in the 5 story annex to the west. Wrong! So is this just a first come first serve method? Very poor management and leadership marriott. This isn't \"let's make a deal.\" When you book a room you do not book a \"room.\" You book your name on a list. It doesn't matter if you request ocean side, street, or corner. We booked a corner room- and paid for it. I discussed this with the manager and he did concur. we were moved the next day. Also, Please don't tell me your full when it appeared 30% of the rooms were vacant. So, loose the \"lottery\" mind set and comply with your web site/booking process. My rate was dropped down to the $189.00 rate (thank you for that). In the future, I suggest your customer's book the the $189.00 rate thence \"wheel and deal\" upon arrival. conclusion- Nice hotel and i enjoyed the stay. I will stay there again.

We were disappointed by the Condado beach, which is the beach this hotel is on. The water was very rough and there were people walking their dogs there, which is not hygienic. We ended up taking a cab to Isla Verde Beach, which had better water. The live band in the evenings was nice. The pool area was just ok; at 3ft with a water slide, it attracted many children, which was fine but there weren't enough lounge chairs; it was just a small pool area, which was made into an \"adult\" pool because of the swim-up bar.

It was also nice having a coffeemaker and small refrigerator in the room, as was having a chair that converted to a small sofabed. I do not gamble, but the casino seemed on the small side. Food and parking were pricey, but I expected that. Parking was $16 per night. I paid a resort fee through Travelocity when I booked my room, so I didn't have to pay the $18.95 for internet access or to utilize the beach umbrellas. So when it comes to those things, be aware. We stayed from weekend to weekend, and unfortunately, the hotel gets super crowded on the weekends. The crowds were pretty obnoxious and \"rushed\", so it was nice having the resort, pool, and beach to ourselves during the week. Things were much, much calmed and relaxed then.

It is really surprising to me that Marriott does not offer free wifi in this day & age! In fact, they said if we wanted to pay for wifi, we would have to pay a daily charge for EACH device (laptop, smartphone, etc.) and as a family, this made no sense. It has been YEARS since we have been charged a fee for wifi in a hotel, and we have stayed in many for work and pleasure. I had to check my email for work, so I crossed the street every evening to Starbucks for a drink of coffee and FREE wifi. Starbucks is the solution for Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crazy internet charges. It is right across the street from the hotel entrance. Self parking is $13/ day in their garage. We got the room via Priceline for $110/night, but Priceline does not guarantee 2 beds. We have 2 kids, and there was no problem when we said we needed a room with 2 beds. They did ask if we wanted to pay an upcharge for ocean view and we declined. The first room they sent us to was occupied, but our key opened the door. Thankfully, no one was in the room at the time! We trudged back to the front desk, hubby talked to the manager, and he gave us a new ocean view room at no additional charge for our trouble. The room was clean, and the beds were comfortable. We also had a small fridge which was nice to keep drinks cold. One big safety issue is that our patio had a steep step down and there is NO light on the balcony. Our boy went out one night to look at the pool (lovely, by the way) and fell down the steep step onto the concrete below. We looked all over for a light and then realized there is NO light out there on the balcony, which is crazy considering the step down and the fact that people will obviously use it at night! If you go out on the balcony at night, please open your curtains to get some light from the room and save yourself from breaking a hip. The pools were really pretty and the towel hut was open until late in the evening. We enjoyed taking a swim in the evenings after a day of touring and sitting in the very hot hottub. The property is pretty and we felt safe. They have constant security at the pool, and close the gate to the beach at night. We also felt very safe walking at night in the general area of the hotel. The hotel was focused primarily on business travelers rather than tourists, and the neighborhood felt more like a local neighborhood than a tourist area. There is a Walgreens in walking distance that has most of what you might need. We enjoyed our stay in Puerto Rico, but I would choose a different hotel if I returned with family.

One time I gave a waitress my order and a tip, she never returned with my drink. I gave another waiter in there a tip and asked that he come see me more often, never saw him again either. Another time I was in the middle of asking for a drink, had to turn around to place a bet and the waitress walked off without my order. I was on the craps table, It was my turn to roll the dice so I placed my bet and they gave the dice to someone else, I tried to take my bet off the table and they told me no. The person they gave the dice to threw a 12 on his first roll, causing me to lose a fair amount of money. After I shared my frustrations with a few of the dealers there, a few of them would make comments in Spanish and would laugh; I found this to be very disrespectful.

After an initial hiccup on the day we arrived - seems the Marriott was hosting a local day camp, a high school prom and a couple of weddings on our first day there. This combination of increased visitors to the pool made the normally enjoyable pool area very unpleasant. The pool area more resembled an over-crowded public city pool than that of an expensive resort. We packed up and made our way to the ocean. However, this only affected our first day. After that the Marriott quickly became the resort that we remembered from our previous 3 visits. The beyond friendly staff goes out of their way to make you comfortable. They all seem to remember little things about you and your preferences as your stay continues. You can tell that they really seem to enjoy their jobs. The pool water slide is great for kids and adults and setting right on the ocean can't be beat. Whether it's a scavenger hunt or hula hoop contest he optional activities help gives the kids extra little diversions during the day. Plus the Salsa lessons, water aerobics classes and Happy Hours were great for the adults. While I mentioned that the entire staff was great, we did want to take a moment to personally call out a few extra special folks that made our stay great - La Vista staff members Aixa, Dahilia and Angelo were awesome. In fact our kids just mentioned today that Angelo from Puerto Rico was \"pretty cool\"! From the Beach Bar - Samuel, Joel and Carlos were great. Our room was spotless after every day that Alejandro was done with it. The pool recreation staff with Noelia, Fidel and of course RITA made sure we had fun. Rita in particular we specifically remembered from our previous stay is a key member of their staff. She is friendly and went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect for us. In Old San Juan we recommend restaurants La Bombanera and Cafe Mallorca for great local food, as well Parrot Club for a little more family friendly upscale setting. Be sure to have the Plantain Chip Nachos. To the left of the resort Argentinian steakhouse UMMO was great. Also our trip to El Yunque Rainforest and water fall were amazing and well worth the trip.

To me, there was nothing glamorous about it and it kind of lowered the class of the hotel a little. The pool and the pool chairs and pool bar were not as nice as they are in the pictures (of course) and they need some renovation as well. You cannot swim up to the pool bar and there's no adult pool.

We had an ocean-front room and I cannot imagine anything else especially since the room itself was so crowded (we had a kind-size bed) so you need a balcony to get some breathing room.

I told my boyfriend I had considered booking La Concha and we should go walk by. La Concha looked like what I was looking for all along. People laughing, drinking, dancing, music.... We got upgraded for $25 p/night. We had a great view from the 18th floor. We ordered pizza from Mike's and they deliver even though the front lobby told us nobody delivers in the area due to the traffic. I guess they wanted us to order room service. We also had dinner at Cafe Puerto Rico in Old San Juan and that was delicious...make room for dessert. I would recommend the resort in general. The Marriott was nice but not if you're looking for a fun time", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBait and Switch\u201d", "Author": "3mw", "ReviewID": "UR114791909", "Content": "In June we were trying to make a last minute reservation for a anniversary trip. We checked tripadvisor for the best place to stay. The Marriott San Juan had a great review and a pop up said they were offering 20% off the weekend stay. When we clicked on in it took us directly to the Marriott.com website. We called a customer representative and they said we were eligible for that rate and all we had to do was show our printed out coupon, so we booked our reservation. When we got to the hotel they would not honor our coupon. It was such a quick trip that we did not have time to argue or try to find a different place to stay. I have been trying to resolve the issue with Marriott for over two weeks and they only reply to me with stock emails that they are sorry and will look into it. I would be very careful of any discounted rate because they might not honor it once they have you at the hotel. This hotel is lacking in many areas and for the price we paid I would have rather stayed at many other hotels. It is not convenient to anything. It is a $15 cab ride to Old San Juan and the neighborhood around the hotel is sketchy to say the least. The cab driver showed us the largest slum in the world (his words) which is just down the street. Plus they have a convention center in the hotel and every night there were HUGE parties that we could hear in our room. The rooms were not especially nice, our view was horrible, and we could not get the room to cool down. Also as other people have mentioned they must sell access to their pool because there were a TON of kids running around with wristbands on. It made the pool VERY crowded. The only positives to this place is that the beach and pool were nice and the restaurants were actually very good.

In order to appeal to all our guests we could not have made a better choice. Perfect location: On the beach, fabulous pool, great bars and restaurants in walking distance, the safest place to be in San Juan. This is a residential area where locals feel safe to jog (during one meal we counted 50 + people jogging!!) Transportation: We took cabs from the airport. They are white vans and SUV's and they are highly regulated, clean, efficient, and downright reasonable for transportation from the airport $18 bucks...they will get you to Old San Juan for $15. If you want to save $14 bucks take the bus.The bus system is UNBELIEVABLE!! 75 cents (change only, no dollars or plastic) a person will get you from the hotel to Old San Juan. The buses are clean, safe, and air-conditioned!!! The hotel is around 2.5 miles from OSJ and makes for a great walk for active folks. The hotel rooms were great. We sat on our 16th story balcony ocean view for hours!! The beach was great. The staff was great and there are some awesome nightly events (Salsa, ladies night, 80's music, etc). It is loud in the evenings and is an event hotel so you can expect proms, weddings, conventions, etc. It makes for alot of fun and the people are great. I would not recommend the 2 restaurants in the hotel: over-priced. There are so many great restaurants nearby (Yerba Buena, Miro, Ummo, Latin Star) and American chains (Starbucks, Dunkin donuts, Wendys) don't waste your money on the hotel restaurants. There is a Walgreens and liquor stores across the street too. We made our own drinks and brought them to the beach. We stayed 7 nights and it wasn't enough. We can't wait to go back. After 2 years of planning (all online, to a place we'd never been!) my husband and I would recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!!! Tips: Take the bus to Old San Juan Bacardi Rum Factory!! Free and a fun ferry ride away! and the rum is super cheap Eat at Cafe Mallorca instead of La Bombanera Have brunch at Miro across the street (Cheese Bikini Sandwich!!) Go to San Cristobal and marvel at how old it is. Walk along th Paseo de la Princesa.... so beautiful!

Better on week days. --Beach is gorgeous and meticulously maintained; however, the recession mustve hit hard because all of the adjacent beachfront properties appeared to be closed with graffiti on the beachfront facades.

Don't stay in the small building because your view is blocked by palm trees for the first 3 levels.

The downside is that this hotel sells \"day passes\" to individuals not staying at the hotel. On a typical Saturday or Sunday the pool becomes over ridden with local families. There are not many beach chairs and they consume the pool. Once Monday came and the kids were back in school, the pool area and beach are wonderful. To avoid this, perhaps do some sightseeing on the weekend and lounging during the week. As others have noted, housekeeping needs something to be desired. One afternoon we went back to the room and found housekeeping had left our room open by using the door latch between door and frame. Other days we would receive a note under our door at 8:30am stating if we wanted our room cleaned we would need to call by 2.

It's a mini-resort. Includes multiple restaurants, bars, access to the beach, fabulous pool with activities daily. The locals will tell you the story about how this hotel was involved in a fire that was set by (who knows who) but blamed on the maitre d. So its kinda not the popular spot from what I hear. I loved it though. It's very modern in look an feel. The lobby is full of action at all times. There's a bar that greets you upon entry, a mini coffee shop and bakery, concierge and tour desks fill the lobby. There's also the entrance to the casino off the lobby. What I liked about this place is the LOCATION! It's a quick walk to some excellent restaurants (Yerba Buena, Ropa Vieja, Bebos, Santurce District) We had a beautiful ocean front view from our room, and when we didn't feel like leaving the hotel- there was plenty of people watching to be done. Between the beach, the casino, the pool, the fitness center, the mini-arcade, the bars- we had fun within our fingertips. The public bus picks up on the corner making for a cheap and easy trip over to Old (Vieja) San Juan. The staff was also pretty awesome. I had a bad experience upon check-in where my reservation didn't show that breakfast was to be included. It was very annoying and an inconvenience, but frankly- that's my only complaint. Well, that and that Wifi isn't free! Its like $18/day! Nuts! You can go to the local Burger King or Pizza Hut for FREE. The rooms were cleaned daily, the air conditioning WORKED, and there were plenty of fluent english speaking staff. I went with my brother and when I didn't feel like hanging out with him- I felt very comfortable going out to the local bars/clubs myself. The front desk staff will definitely tell you not to do this- as San Juan has its share of violence, but I felt comfortable and just stayed alert while walking to and from. What else can I tell you.... the tour desk offers packages to Ponce, El Yunque (the rainforest), Bacardi, Snorkeling... you name it! It's actually not a bad package deals in terms of offerings or price. While its not terribly hard to get around in San Juan, they drive kind of ... CRAZY! No turn signals and extremely AGGRESSIVE. So if you can stand paying the premium to have someone drive you around, go for it. On Friday and Saturday night by the pool, there is a movie projected. Pretty cool. Daily there are free fitness classes, dance lessons, gaming (ie gambling) lessons and even options to rent bikes (~$25/day).", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perrysburg, Ohio, USA", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Service\u201d", "Author": "Angelcry", "ReviewID": "UR108345494", "Content": "We picked this hotel based on other reviews that stated that the beds were \"heavenly\".

We used Marriott points for our stay and were on the 10th floor with an ocean view. It was a beautiful hotel with a great location. Yes, the carpet is not the best in the rooms, which I expected from a hotel right on the beach, but every other part of this hotel is clean and inviting. We had extremely good service from every area of the hotel. The only issue we had was our room service order was wrong but we were too hungry to care. The food and drinks at the hotel are really good but are a little higher priced. We hit the Walgreen's (out front door two blks to right) for snacks, water, and soda and the mini mart (two blks out front door to left) for a Styrofoam cooler and alcohol. You are allowed to take a cooler on the beach but not in the pool area. This worked really well for us and saved us quite a bit of money on drinks. We ate at a couple restaurants around hotel and were disappointed with the food. Mira, across the street from hotel was suggested our first night and was too salty too finish. Buenos Ayres on same block as Walgreen's is not worth the walk. There were several others that we wish we would of tried instead. The food in Old San Juan is amazing. Lupis in San Juan was amazing! We had the burrito with chili verde and the nachos and would suggest to go there. Oh, and definitely try the Chicken Quesadilla from the beach bar. We rented a car for one day from Charlie's, which is a small booth next to Starbucks for some exploring. Rental was inexpensive but deposit is hefty; it is returned however. We used GPS app on phone and had no problems getting around. I went on the zip lining adventure which was awesome! It is a workout getting up the hill but well worth it. Bring a bottle water or they have some available for $2. They tell you its for 9 zip lines but if you do good with the braking they will let you go on three different lines after the 8th line. It was fantastic! We also went snorkeling at Luquillo and Los Cabros near Fajardo on the way to ride the electric boat into the bio bay. *You can not snorkel at the hotel beach. The waves are too rough. The hotel beach is great for body surfing and jumping waves.* Luquillo has a reef with pretty fish for snorkeling. Los Carbros had sea grass where we saw lots of wildlife while snorkeling including; sea stars, sea cucumbers, conch shells, and even a sea snake. The bio bays are a MUST see while there. We really wanted to do the full day excursion where they pick you up at hotel and you can swim in the bio bay, but the tour had been booked for about a week and a half before we got there. The kayak tour was available but not a good choice for our group so we decided to go with Captain Suarez on the electric boat. This is a totally natural wonder and is super cool. I would suggest booking this as soon as you know you are going.

The front desk staff were friendly and efficient at check in. A hostess brought us face towels and rum punch to welcome us. AREA: Starbuck's and Haagen Dazs across the street. Walgreen's open 24 hours just up the block. Several small restaurants and tourist shops nearby. A $15 cab ride took us to Old San Juan. Well worth going for the forts as well as the restaurants and shops! ROOM: We had a partial ocean view room, well worth it! We could see up the coast and hear the waves from our balcony. The room was comfortable, if a little cramped, for four people. No matter, we hardly spent time in it! Room was clean and everything in working order. Housekeeping were great! I left a note the first morning asking for extra towels and after that they kept everything (towels, toiletries) stocked to overflowing! BREAKFAST: There are two tiers to paying for breakfast: 1. $11.95 gets you overflowing buffet of fruits, oatmeal, breads/pastries, cheese, and hot table items. Drinks cost extra. 2. $21.95 adds breakfast drinks and choice of made to order waffle, pancakes or omelet. Breakfast for two (even though we had four in the room) was part of our room rate (and this includes the more expensive option!) so we ate there most mornings. The buffet is amazing. We found it well worth the $11.95 price(we still had to pay for two people each day and chose not to do the made to order for those.) Breakfast area staff were great:-) Sunny and Angelo were full of personality! AMENITIES: Fitness Center has a good variety of cardio machines and free weights. It's a shame they hide it in the basement instead of putting it where we could have a view of the beach while working out! Swimming pools are nice sized and there is a hot tub. Unfortunately, even though a sign is posted that limits hot tub use to those over age 12, several times people brought babies in swim diapers into it...yuck! So I chose not to use it much of the time. Beach is wonderful for sunning, wading and playing! Not the best for swimming - waves are kind of rough here and you have to be careful to stay away from a group of large rocks in one area. Marriott provides lounge chairs and umbrellas to guests who have paid the daily resort fee. Pool bar and restaurant have servers on the beach so we ordered lunch here one day. Our server (Angelina?) was very efficient and friendly, going out of her way to custom order a salad for me (I am vegan). A couple of remarks about cleanliness: 1. The treadmill I used in the fitness room had a fan on it. The fan grill had dirt caked on the airvent grills, so I didn't turn it on. I didn't want to breathe filthy air while working out. 2. The swimming pool area had quite a bit of green algae growing around on decking.

We are a family of 4 from Massachusetts (2 daughters, age 12 and 15). I am fairly particular about cleanliness, service, and a relaxing atmosphere when I go on vacation. We are also a pretty active, health conscious family that likes to swim, snorkel, and eat good healthy meals. So here's the deal........... If I went back to the Condado area of San Juan I would stay at the Marriott again. It has everything you need and seemed more geared towards families than La Concha down the street. The pools are very nice though it was tough to find chairs since the hotel was nearly full. The beach was pretty and clean but is also a public beach so on the weekends there are a lot of locals with loud music and trinkets for sale. Just be cautious to pick the right spot before getting settled. There are plenty of chairs and umbrellas that the staff sets up for you. Not sure what the other reviews were referring to when complaining about the hotel shading the pool and beach. We had full sunshine every day, all day. It was a very easy hotel to get around - everything is within steps. The staff was great - never a problem. Very, very friendly bartenders and wait staff. Check in took a little while but mostly due to guests using the front desk clerk as the concierge and asking a million questions. The rooms were spacious and clean. We stayed on the 10th floor of the tower and had a partial ocean view - very nice to sit on the balcony and read every morning. Being right there in the city was both good and bad. You had every convenience you needed (Walgreen's, Starbucks, etc.) as well as many, many Puerto Rican restaurants. After a few nights, however, it got old. The food is the same everywhere and most of it is VERY heavy (plantains, rice, beans, mufongo). Honestly, there wasn't a night that we all loved our meals. I didn't see a vegetable for days!! We're pretty healthy eaters so it started to get to us. The best meal of the day was the breakfast buffet at the hotel! Overall, I would recommend this hotel but just realize you ARE in the city when you go out the front door - interesting at first, but just kind of dirty and old after a while. Old San Juan is a little nicer and worth going to both during the day and at night. It's a $15 cab ride. Not sure I'd hurry back to Puerto Rico but if I did I would try another area of the island that is more remote.

The check in line was always bustling during the day and people were talking about how their rooms were not ready. Ready or not, it seemed that the Marriott reimbursed (casino coupon, drink coupon\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6etc.) those people in some sort of fashion for their room not being ready. It really depends on how one feels about his/her room not being ready upon check in. We received a room on the 9th floor overlooking the front of the hotel. At first we were a little bummed about not receiving an ocean view, but I really enjoyed our room, and would definitely request it again. Even though the view was the street, you could see the vegetation and mountains in the background. Our balcony was also double the size of the ocean view ones. It was also very quiet, but I am not sure about the sounds over by the ocean/pool area. The room was tastefully decorated, many yellow hues in the curtains, rug and bed spread. There was a King bed, small upholstered chair, large desk, bed stands, dresser/refrigerator, flat screen television, safe, marble countertop bathroom, waffle shower curtain, tub/shower- rain like stream and bath amenities (shampoo, condition, hand lotion, hair dryer\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6etc.) The pool area was very large. There were two pools, one quite shallow and the other around 4 feet perhaps which led into a pool bar. There was also a waterslide and a couple of waterfalls. The pool area was very, very busy due to the school vacation week. You definitely had to seek out your pool side chairs bright and early. I used the fitness center also during the week, which was well equipped! The beach was my favorite part. The waves were rough and furious, but it was so much fun to play in. I would advise beginning swimmers to be quite cautious. You do receive chairs and umbrellas upon request. I would question the umbrellas though. One day we were charged $12.00 for one and the next, nothing? We did tip the beach employees very well, due to their hard work and boy it was hot. So hot, that people were running on the steamin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sand when they headed to and from the beach. Again, if you want a prime front and center spot, definitely seek one out early. There are employees taking drink orders, but in my opinion the beach was understaffed. I also think that there should be a more organized system for taking drink orders. Perhaps a flag on the back of your chair that you could raise so that the employee knows you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to order something. I know that I would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ordered more if there were more employees available and it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem forever to get a drink/ food. This was a different story at the pool area. It seems more staffed and I was asked each day if I needed something. Food: We ordered room service once and ate lunch pool side a couple of times. The food is decent for what you are ordering \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 chicken fingers, fries, sandwiches\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 etc. Pure salty beach food! As far as the restaurants on site, we were hinted by many to try elsewhere. We did try a couple of the walk able restaurants on Ashford Ave. Miro, which is right across the street from the Marriott was really good. It has mixed reviews, but we enjoyed it. Tijuana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mexican, which is to the left when you walk out of the Marriott. We really loved this low key place. The food was good and we enjoyed the margaritas. We did try Lucky Star for a quick lunch, but I would prefer elsewhere next time. We also heard that the pizza place next to Tijuana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was a good pick too! Area: We took a couple of walks in the morning. My favorite was around the lagoon. To do this, walk right out of the Marriott, left at Walgreens (1 block away) and before you hit the express way turn right (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s after a school). Head up and round the lagoon and then hook right back to the hotel along the ocean on Ashford. If you want, you can even walk into Old San Juan, which we did one morning- of course getting a coffee and mallorca at La Bombonera along the way. In Old San Juan, we walked El Morro, which was free due to history week and then jumped on the boat to Cantano and headed to Bacardi for the rum tour. Once back, we caught a cab back to the Marriott. Tours: Funny story\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we did have the Bio Bay tour booked, which we booked through the Marriott concierge upon our arrival. When the day came to head out via car rental to El Yunque , Farjado and Luquillo, we decided to turn in our bio bay tour for pure relaxation. The concierge couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it when we went to tell them that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want a refund, but we wanted to release the spot for anyone who wanted it. The concierge was also shocked when we wanted to turn in the tour since all tours for the week were booked solid. We ended up getting our money back, which was great, because the concierge sold it to someone else within a couple of hours. The funny part is that when we decided to play our luck in the casino that night, my husband won $1000.00. So in the end, we gave up the beautiful forest, beach and bio bay for a little pocket change. Overall impression: The Marriott is a great hotel in a stellar location. If you want to head to Isle Verde or Old San Juan, you are smack in the middle. You can walk down Ashford Drive which holds tons of shops, boutiques and restaurants. The staff at the Marriott was very kind and helpful. San Juan is a great getaway for anyone seeking history, beach, fun and exploration.

The granite was beautiful, the fixtures were very nice. The bathroom was large. The bedroom was very nice also with an HD flat-screen TV, very nice duvet and 8 assorted pillows on the bed. Opening a very well-insulated door led to a balcony overlooking the pool area (I know other balconies might have overlooked the ocean or the front of the hotel). The air conditioning system worked flawlessly. Breakfast in the dining area allowed seating either inside or outside in the breeze. The breakfast was served hot, fast, and was excellent. The hotel is right on the beach, one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. What's not to like? This hotel was like a step back in time, only with the best in technology taken back with you.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by a hostess offering a free alcoholic fruity drink (non alcoholic for our teenager). Yummy. There was a problem with our room- even tho we booked for 3 people, they gave us a room with one king bed. The alternative was an ocean front room with a balcony- very nice! Until they hassled us by calling, leaving voice mail, AND leaving a note under the door that we were to contact the front desk IMMEDIATELY! Hey, we were out having dinner and exploring the neighborhood. When they finally called and reached us, it was confrontational- stating how they had been trying to get ahold of us, etc.,demanding to know what rate our reservation was, and they told us \"there were 2 guests with the same name.\" Someone on their end must have screwed up. At least they let us stay in the room.... We had breakfast at Starbucks right across the street in the morning. Our return stay was in a room facing the street, but we didn't mind. It was a problem getting there so early- right off the ship- and our room wasn't ready until 4 pm(and the snarky front desk staff told us they were going to be very busy, so don't come back to check on our room!) We couldn't get room credit without a room to charge it to, so we walked down the street to the Walgreens and used the ATM for more cash, cold water, snacks, etc. We ate at their outside restaraunt both times and loved the food.

It does feel like South Beach, but, a little more low key. Lots of restaurants, a few open 24/7. We ate at the Latin Club many a night after partying to the wee hours of the morning. The beach and pool area are gorgeous. We paid the upgrage to stay in an Ocean view room and it was worth it. We left our slider door open and listenend to the ocean every night. We had the best bartender, Suki, ever. She was always eager to tell us the \"places to go\" and every night would check in and see how our day was. Drinks and food are pricey, but, there is happy hour from 4-6 pm and both pool bars, then drink specials after that in the lobby bar. Thurs nite is ladies night, $2 well drinks from 8-11pm, awesome deal. The service was excellent in the pool area, someone was always walking around to take drink or food orders. Walgreens is a block away, so we stocked up on bottled water, and other drinks and snacks for the beach. If you can pack a soft cooler to keep these items cool at the beach, otherwise we bought one at Walgreens for $7 and it was well worth it. There is a fridge in the room as well. Wifi is not included. It is almost $10 a day per wireless device. But, Starbucks is literally across the street and Dunkin Donuts is about 2 blocks away, so you can access their free WiFi. The service was great. Havier the bell man was sweet. We booked 3 tours from Ms. Fergueson in the lobby. It was convient (as we were picked up there) and she was very helpful. Maid service was awesome. There were activities plannend at the pool, or at least listed on the board, but, I never saw them happen, except the water slide (I think I went down it 50 times) and beach volleyball. The last day our flight didn't leave till 5pm and we were allowed to shower in the spa area, which was a nice ammenity. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel.

They gave us a beeper, checked our bags, and gave us a complimentary drink as we sat on the beach and relaxed until our room was ready. Our room once we checked in was BEAUTIFUL! I would recommend requesting the smaller Marriott building - not the high rise - we had a partial ocean view on the 2nd floor right off the lobby overlooking the pool. We were right in the mix of things! I did not find it loud and loved how close we were to the lobby, pool, beach, gym ,etc. The room was clean, bright and sunny and our balcony was really nice. From the first night on, we had exceptionally friendly staff who accomodated everything! On the first morning, we asked at teh breakfast buffet if they had any newspapers laying around - the waiter searched around and even went to the lobby to find us one!! I highly recommend the breakfast buffet for 11.95 every morning - absolutely delicious and filling. We also got excellent recommendations from the concierge on dinner and for my birthday, the concierge made us a reservation at PAMELAS - which was a cab ride but an ABSOLUTELY delicious restaurant right on the beach. She made our reservation at 645 p.m. so we could capture a perfect sunset. The gym at the hotel was awesome as well. Open 24 hours, there were plenty of towels, tvs on all the machines, yoga overlooking the beach, and even scented cold towels for after your workout. There was complimentary water, towels, and nice private showers for after the work out. VERY Friendly staff and not too busy. The beach was lovely - the guys who worked there put the loungers out where you wanted them and I did not think the water was that rough. I loved the landscape - the urban feel of this hotel.

The rooms were not ready on time. We did not get rooms we wanted but we took them for fear of not getting a room. I cannot overstate the problems at the reception desk. When we got the rooms, they were still dirty. The cleaning people couldnt turn the rooms around fast enough for the guests, and the rooms were not cleaned properly. The pool is nice, but way over crowded. It is not a big enough pool or pool area for the number of guests. Similarly the beach is nice but over crowded with guests. The lobby is loud and unappealing. The music drifts up to the hotel rooms late at night. We stayed in two different areas of the hotel and on two different floors. It was noisy in both rooms. The hotel restaurant is expensive and not good. Eat at any of the near by restaurants. Given that we were only staying for a night or two before and after the cruise, the reception problems made this hotel too inconvenient for a short stay.

We had some reservations about staying at the here based on some of the reviews we read, but didn't find many of the problems that some others encountered. We tried to check in when we arrived at 2pm, but our room wasn't ready so we just relaxed, ate lunch, and looked around. We were able to check in a 4pm, but didn't get the high room that we requested and were placed in an oceanfront front (we upgraded) on the 5th floor of the Tower and were told that that was all there was. The tax rate and resort fee added almost 25% to our bill--so take that into account. The room was nothing really special, but it was nice and comfortable. It was very clean and had plenty of towels, refridgerator, hair dryer, robes to use while there, and they left two bottles of water everyday. The entire staff at the Marriott was extremely friendly and very helpful. The casino was also nice however I agree with some of the other write ups about not getting drinks while you gambled. Someone at one of the gaming tables got so frustrated by it that they finally called the Pit Boss over and asked him to get a waitress to come by the table. It was a constant struggle every night we were there. The most wonderful thing about the hotel was the close location to local restaurants and because it is somewhat residential, it is also a safe walking street at night. There was a police presence everywhere. We highly recommend Yuba Buena up the street for authentic Puerto Rican food at a decent price. Via Appia, also close, was excellent as well. We were glad that someone mentioned the little grocery store up the street to get drinks and snacks because we did just that. Drinks are very high at the hotel ($8 and up) so it was nice to have something to keep in our room. The hotel lobby turns into a night club on Wednesdays through Sundays when the hotel brings in local bands and has dancing. The bands were really great and we enjoyed just sitting there listening to them and watching everyone Salsa--one night we even gave it a go. Lots of locals came in to dance so it was very fun to be a part of that. I'd recommend trying to get a higher room than we were on, because you can sometimes hear the music late at night. We ate at the hotel Italian restaurant and our food and service was excellent. The breakfast buffet is quite expensive, but we made it brunch and didn't eat lunch when we ate there. It was really delicious and had everything you could possibly want to eat. Our waiters there were very friendly and attentive. The outdoor bar and eating area was convenient, but the food was not very good and was also expensive. If you go to the beach area and want chairs and umbrellas, there are very friendly staff there to help set up everything where ever you want. They do expect a tip however, but it was worth it. Even though the beach was red flagged everyday there were still people swimming. The pools were quite nice but crowded so we never went there. There were lots of activities for kids and adults posted on a sign everyday--everything from learning to Salsa to kids crafts. There is a tour desk in the lobby that can arrange any tours you want. Many people suggested that you could see old San Juan in half a day and honestly I don't see how that is possible--there is just too many things--shops, forts and historic sites. It's quite a hike around so wear comfortable shoes. I encourage everyone to visit the old forts. You can buy a ticket to see both forts at a discount or just to see one. Don't miss the free movie that both forts have. I'd recommend you see the movie before you look around the forts because it really helped us understand more about what we were seeing. The movie is the same at each fort, so you only have to see it once. We always took the bus that picked us up a block from the hotel (75 cents per person and must be exact change) rather than spend the $14 for a cab ride. It's a little tricky figuring out the transportation system, but once we did it was great--as long as you are not in a hurry. Briefly, the bus B21 will take to Old San Juan and you have the option of walking from the drop off spot or picking up a trolley. I would recommend getting both a bus and a trolley map from the hotel before going to Old San Juan because they all go on certain routes depending on the bus and the color trolley. When you are ready to return to your hotel, you need to go to the bus station (close to the pier) and once inside locate the bus number you want from the hanging signs.

Everyone we talked to was helpful and friendly from the representative at the check in desk to the valet parking and the bellhops. Our room in the cabana wing on the seventh floor was ideal. It was clean and had a great balcony with a view over the pool directly toward the beach. The beach area at this hotel is the best of all the hotels in Condado. The pool area is beautiful with lush tropical landscaping and plenty of seating. The water was a bit cold but it did not stop most people from swimming. We ate lunch at the La Vista restaurant one day because it was convenient to the beach and had good food at a reasonable price for a hotel restaurant. Most of the time however we ate at the restaurants on Asheford Avenue which is a lively street with a broad selection of good restaurants. On Friday night, in the hotel lobby bar, they had a live samba band playing. There was a dance floor and a big turnout including not only hotel guests but a number of locals as well. I had booked this reservation through Priceline and won the bid at less than two thirds the rack rate. (There are only a couple of four star resorts on Condado beach so my odds of getting this property were good.)

To start, the pool area and hotel in general do not look like they do in the pictures - the pool area was especially disappointing. The only part of the hotel that I thought lived up to the standards I was expecting from reviews/photos was the actual room we stayed in, which admittedly was very nice/clean. The beach was also fine, you can't really go wrong with a beach since all they had to do is set up the chairs/umbrella. I wasn't sure which I was more disappointed with - the overpriced for what it was food (which was blah) or the service and attitude of the staff. Food - the only lunch options is the grill outside, or the $25 buffet indoors (you can also order off the menu). The grill outside has a very limited menu, and I don't think you could get any wrap or sandwich for less than $12. We ate there the day we arrived and never went back. The morning buffet was not included in our room, and this also we found to be very overpriced. It was $12.00 for the buffet, not including coffee or OJ. If you wanted coffee or juice, the price went up to $17 dollars, and if you wanted an omelette the price went up to $19. While I understand the difference between a breakfast with eggs, I've never heard of a breakfast buffet that didn't include coffee and juice. That being said, we ordered omeletes off the menu for 11.95 which were fine, but again we decided to not go back after that. Service - this was some of the rudest service I've experienced in a long time. Every person at the hotel acted like you were really putting them out if you asked a simple question. The concierge was especially unhelpful when we asked for dinner recommendations and seemed annoyed that we would even be asking. On top of that, the only help she gave us for restaurants was a map they have of the restaurants immediately surrounding the hotel - this list included Chili's - not really a restaurant I plan to go to while on vacation. She didn't even mention Old San Juan, where a lot of the best restaurants are located. Good thing we had done our own research on dining before. The service at the beach was rude for the most part as well. The first day we got there and asked for an umbrella, they told it would be $12. I'm not sure where they came up with this fee, since umbrellas are included in the price of your room (we checked our packet we had gotten when we checked in). After pointing this out to them, they then set up our umbrella at no cost. I'm not sure if this is just a way they try to rip-off hotel guests who don't realize it's included. Again, they seemed very annoyed that we would think of disturbing them to help set up our chairs. Overall I would not recommend this hotel.

Booked through Travelocity, so there were no hidden costs (11%, 12% hotel resort service charge that some mentioned). Initially, Travelocity screwed up and did not book the room for our first night of travel. We were arriving 4AM and wanted our room ready as it was 3 nights, 4th night free promotion.. They made good by booking another night just in case our room wasn't ready. When we arrived we were told that the reservation expired because they weren't aware we would be arriving late. I was pleasant and eventually after some power play on their part, they gave us our room early for no charge. The room was beautiful and very clean with an amazing ocean view and balcony, despite that we opted and paid for a partial ocean view. Really nice bathroom and beddings. We were on the top floor so we were in awe of the view. It's not an enormous hotel, but still very lovely pool area (with slide) and enough seating. They set us up on the beach with complimentary umbrellas and lounge chairs. The water was rough, but nothing we aren't used to on the east coast. Weather was a bit iffy in the early hours, but soon cleared to crystal clear, blue skies after that. No humidity, but warm...a welcome treat for us north easterners who suffered through this past winter. I didn't find the prices of drinks any more expensive than at other resorts in other places. Service was very good. Yes, the lobby does get loud at night, but nothing crazy. My husband loved the gym and sauna. I enjoyed reading on the beach. Two things that were free of service and we highly appreciate were the free use of computers for 1 hour daily and the ability to check in and print out boarding passes. We didn't try the food. Instead, we walked out to the right and had some really good sandwiches for lunch, which we brought back. About 2 blocks to the right when leaving the hotel is a small surfboard store/restaurant. Very good eggs benedict, french toast, sandwiches. I found all things take time in PR. So don't get antsy waiting for food. The staff here is so nice and accomodating. Try the humus wrap or chicken, bacon and avocado sandwich. There is also a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel. This was a great, safe area to stay in. Close to Old San Juan (we ate dinners here) with many stores nearby. You could walk...it's 3 miles, take a taxi or the very slow to come bus. No problem getting a bus going, but at the depot coming back, we waited over 1 hr one night. Old San Juan is a beautiful mix of culture, history and modern conveniences (restaurants and shops).

Glenda and others at the concierge are actually rude and unhelpful when you ask simple questions about restaurants, The housekeeping, front door, beach staff, Vista staff are excellent, but the front desk - just really not nice. the experience with the fees will make me hesitant to recommend this place until they develop an open, honest policy.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cnot worth the money\u201d", "Author": "bostonjane0001999", "ReviewID": "UR98066862", "Content": "Definitely stay somewhere else and you will get better service and better value.

Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and happily recommend the Marriott as a place to stay in San Juan. Check-in: Cab from airport was $15 for I think up to 6 passengers and $1 per bag. We arrived around 1 and check-in was easy for us, but we did have to wait until 4 to get our room. There is a sign by the check-in area indicating check-in time isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until 4, which to me implies they generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make rooms available until close to that time. They held our luggage and we went out for a walk and to lunch, so worked out fine for us. Seems like there were certain times of the day, especially in the evening, when the check-in line got long. Room: We were in 837 in the shorter tower. The room was just fine and the balcony was great. We had a beautiful view of the ocean and pool area. Room was referred to as partial ocean view, only because the taller tower blocks part of your view to the right and there is a condominium complex that blocks part of your view to the left. But we were still able to see plenty of the beach and ocean. Definitely worth the $25 per night upgrade fee over the city view. Casino: Like others have said it gets crowded in the evening but is dead in the morning/afternoon. Had $5/$10 blackjack tables, $5 craps tables, and a gazillion slot machines. The big negative for me was my difficulty in getting a drink. After about 30 minutes of playing BJ and not getting a sniff of the cocktail waitress, I asked the dealer and then the pit boss if there was one making rounds. I was ignored by both. This boggles my mind as a couple of watered down gin & tonics would have satisfied me and kept me throwing my precious money away. Finally I flagged a waitress down and she retrieved me a drink quickly. But in 90 minutes I never saw one at my table. Location/Restaurants: Location was great. Starbucks across the street was surprisingly quiet. Walgreens doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sell beer but there is a mini-super market about three blocks to the east of the hotel that does. There is a Catholic Church two blocks away. There are numerous restaurants close by. The Argentinean steakhouse was pricey, food was ok, and nice outdoor eating area. Zucchero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s across the street had good pizza and nice atmosphere, though no outdoor eating area. Tijuana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food was good but drinks were terrible and overpriced. I was charged $12 for a mojito/margarita mixed drink that I could barely finish. And service was painfully slow. If you eat there sit outside and order beers or something cheap. Beach/Pool: The beach was nice and the water was warmer than I expected. Felt at least 80 degrees. I actually enjoyed the shadows cast by the hotel tower onto the beach as I prefer to minimize my sun exposure and not die of skin cancer when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 55. Plenty of chairs and space. It seems like the beach is gradually eroding, which hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affected the Marriott beach much yet, but has had a significant impact on La Concha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beach a few hundred yards to the west as well as beaches to the east. They take away all chairs by 6 pm or so and close the beach entrance shortly thereafter. I think this is more to keep the rift raft out than Marriott patrons in, as the beach is publically accessible. Waves are rough and only for those like myself who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind getting smacked around by the surf. Pool area was nice, though water seems colder than ocean. Pool and slide were great for young children and there were plenty of space and lounge chairs. Hotel Restaurants/Nightlife: Ate at Tuscany one night, which was quite good. Not cheap but not exorbitant. Dropped a C-note before tip on appetizer, bottle of merlot, and entrees of Lamb and Osso Bucco. Especially enjoyed the lamb. In the lobby there was a DJ on Thursday night, live music Friday through Sunday nights, and nothing on Monday night. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loud, festive, and enjoyable for a couple looking for a post dinner drink and maybe a dance or two. La Concha, situated a block to west, has a beautiful lobby/pool area that is worth checking out. My wife & I wandered over there on a Thursday night and the club facing the pool was packed and seemed to have a good vibe for those looking to kick it up a notch. Weather: The weather.com forecast called for showers every day during our stay. We were pleasantly surprised that weather ranged from variably cloudy to mostly sunny with just a few isolated rain showers. It seems like we had a sprinkle every day, and a couple days we had a 15 minute downpour, but that was it. The winds push in from time to time but seem to subside after a couple of hours. Temps were pleasant, ranging from low 80s during the day to low 70s at night. Overall a great hotel. We rented a car and did a day trip to El Yunque and Luquillo on northeast corner of island.

The fitness center is free and is very nicely equipped with aerobic machines and weight machines, plus some free weights.

The Marriott had a beautiful beach with plenty of chairs and umbrellas no matter what time of day you arrived. And no keeping track of towels either.

Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance along with a 24 hr Walgreens right across the street that has a mini mart grocery store.

We stayed in a city view room, but it also had a view of the ocean, which was gorgeous! At night, the lobby is very loud. We loved the beach, although the ocean was rough. I don't recommend going more than waist-high at most if you don't want to take the chance of getting pummeled by the waves. I went out a little and, while being fun for the most part, I got pushed back and knocked down a lot. If you like to lay out at the beach, I recommend placing your chairs near the big rocks on the left. Be careful if you put your belongings on the ground if you are near the ocean! My flip flops got washed over to a chair a few feet away! My mom and I ate at La Vista for breakfast two days in a row. It is very good and casual. You can get the buffet or order a la carte. The omelets are good, as are the banana pancakes. The two waiters we had were very nice, but on the second day we ate there the service was very slow. That was fine since all we had to do that day was go to the beach, but if you have somewhere to go, I would either get to the restaurant earlier in order to have enough time, or go to the Starbucks right across the street. We ate at the beach bar one day, and it wasn't amazing. The food was just okay, not somewhere I want to eat again; however, the serving staff was nice. We never ate at Tuscany. The rooms are nice. They are standard hotel rooms, but impeccably clean. They are bright and cheerful. Ours was yellow. The balconies are very nice and a great perk to the otherwise standard rooms. the bathroom in the room is nice. The water pressure in the shower is very good, and you get free Bath & Body Works shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion, which I appreciated. There is a Walgreens down the street, which we visited more than I thought. It's great for those \"Oh I had no idea I would use this much sunscreen!\" moments. The restaurant Tijuana's is right down the street and is nice, but busy. It is a Tex-Mex restaurant, I thought, but good for what it is. If you have time, I would recommend going to Old San Juan and going on a guided Segway tour (either 45 minutes or 2 hours; I recommend the two hours). Go to Pier 2 and it is the last office on the left. It is a good idea to make a reservation. Afterwards, go to Al Dente restaurant, which is located on Calle Recinto Sur.

The gift shop is also over priced but enough about all that because if you're not on a budget then none of this probably matters to you. But if you're not on a budget I would say go all out and stay somewhere that is much nicer. The location of the hotel is good and not far from the hot spots and the airport (18 dollar cab ride). Plenty of places to eat but you'll have to venture out of the area if you want authentic Puerto Rican food at a good price. Casino action is probably the weakest out of all the casinos I have been to but it's the whole island not just this hotel. If you're a serious gambler go somewhere else like Vegas or Biloxi. If you just want to play a few hands of blackjack for fun then this is the place. The tables do get crowded though. I was there during Valentines day weekend so I saw a lot of couples and not too many singles. Good place to go with a partner or if you don't want to be hassled.

We made some down time between our schedules. We checked other online reviews and asked around. When we vacation, we look for relaxation and quality all around. We originally booked at the El San Juan. If you read around, all the sites say this and the Ritz Carlton are top places in San Juan. Don't believe the hype! The Ritz is a fantastic place, but you can have the El San Juan and the area around these properties is a ghetto. When we got to the El San Juan, this is what we found. 1. A lobby that resembled a gangster rap video 2. A pool that looked and sounded like an episode of the Jersey Shore 3. A room that we afraid to sit down in or touch anything If this is what you are looking for while on vacation, then this is the place for you. We went downstairs to request a room change. After four hours of run-around and listening to three other guests with similar dissatisfaction, we had enough. We went to the Ritz and they could not accommodate us for the entire time we would be in town. We looked online and found that the Marriott San Juan & Stellaris Casino had a special on corner Ocean View rooms. We jumped in a cab to check out the rooms. We were in no mood to take any more chances. Upon arrival, the hotel was very busy. The place is beautiful, very clean and current. We went up to the front desk and met Poliris. She listened attentively and truly understood our dilemma. She requested to have someone show us a room, but it was so busy no one was currently available. She actually received OK to break away from her Front Desk duties and show us a corner room. It was amazing! Ocean view with two balconies. Very roomy, clean and updated. Without hesitation, we took the room. We found out that their onsite pricing was only $10 more per night than the online internet specials. My wife and I were commenting to each other how it worked out in our favor that we didn't stay at the Ritz, because the Marriott had so much to offer and you can actually enjoy the neighborhood outside the property. Considering our situation, the room price really didn't matter. As it turns out, the room prices were very reasonable, considering the quality and value. Poliris is a true professional. Her attention to detail and willingness to accommodate us even during a very busy time truly won us over. My wife and I were discussing how rare it is to find such professionalism in the hospitality business these days. We have traveled extensively for 20 years and really never bothered to write reviews. It was the professionalism of Poliris and her commitment to take care of us that inspired us to share this story. The Marriott is lucky to have her onboard. If this is the Marriott's standard of hire, you will have a fantastic experience. We are still here and the place and people have consistently delivered. The location is great. The area is very trendy with great restaurants and high-end shopping. Right up the street is Gucci, Ferragamo and Cartier. We stumbled on the Marriott San Juan & Stellaris by chance. Considering our travel background, we were embarrassed but pleasantly surprised that we weren't aware of this gem in San Juan. We don't do online commercials, but these folks are truly deserving of your business.

We had a rental car for the entire visit so it was easy to get around to Rincon and the El Yunque rainforest as well as other beaches on the island. Our package included breakfast for the adults; however for the price of our package, breakfast for our elementary aged children should have been included. Also had a problem where they tried to charge us for the included breakfasts which had to be addressed prior to check out. The lobby/check in area is small and set up to accommodate bar patrons rather than quick check in for guests. Also the live music is too loud and very disruptive during late night check-in. The pool and beach area was inviting and clean. We actually liked the shade provided by the palm trees in the pool area since the sun is very strong. Our biggest complaint was that the room had a very strong musty/mildew odor. The carpet had completely absorbed the odor and needed to be replaced. We asked for a new room, but the hotel was full for the holiday weekend. I also smelled the musty odor at the elevator bank so I don't think it was just our room.

We love it because it is a 10-min, $15 cab ride from the airport, and unlike many Caribbean \"resorts\", it's not in the middle of nowhere. The room is a typical Marriott room, but I have to say that this is one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in! The bathroom near the pool is immaculate, which is pretty amazing with everyone trekking in from the pool/beach. Before you book via third-party sites, check the Marriott's page for specials. We had a buy 3 get 1 day free plan with free breakfast for 2. As the other reviewers have said, it's great that you can simply walk out the door to go to Subway, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts (no bagels, FYI), Walgreens and other restaurants. It's super convenient! We like the Mexican place out to the left called Tijuana's. It's very casual, and pretty noisy, but the food is good. We didn't like the Italian place to the left of it, but loved the one across the street from Tijuana's. They have great pizza. It's definitely worth it to take a cab ($15 each way) or the bus into Old San Juan. It's very quaint, but also very lively. I highly recommend Al Dente restaurant at 309 Calle Recinto Sur. The Vista restaurant in the hotel has a great breakfast buffet. You can order omelettes and pancakes via the waiter. It's $20, but with all of the taxes it can be quite pricy. It's worth it if you can get free breakfast with your room. As everyone else has commented, the pool is in the shade, and a good portion of it is just a wading pool, so we don't waste any time there! The beach is lovely. You never have to worry about them running out of chairs, or \"staking your claim\" at 8 in the morning like other places. Ask the guys to put your chairs to the left (near the rocks) if you don't want to keep moving them due to shade. The ocean is a little rough, but if you know how to go out a little past where the waves break, you'll be fine. The Marriott is totally rockin at night. It's definitely the place to be for the locals, and they tend to have live music almost every night. Definitely request a room that is high up, so you don't hear the music all evening. The casino is small, but it gets pretty crowded at night. The gym is pretty good, and the machines are current. If you can't get late check-out, you can always take a shower at the gym before your flight.

The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful with directions to the airport and bus and local attractions like El Yunque and Arecibo. Downside is that you aren't allowed on the beach at night for your safety. This would be true of many areas. The reason I gave the location a 4 is that the area Condado is not perfect there are empty buildings and hotels.

Overall I'd give this particular hotel a solid 3-star rating which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but just based on our experiences with other hotels and for comparison purposes, Marriott Stellaris gets a solid 3-star. Marriott Stellaris is a reasonably good option for a visit to San Juan. First of all, the location is fantastic and it's a beachfront hotel. Right outside the hotel are numerous restaurants and bars. You wont go hungry when you get tired of hotel food. Starbucks is literally across the street and Walgreens is on the next block. It's on Ashford Ave which has multiple bus stops where you can hop on the #21 bus for a 20-min ride to Old San Juan which is the historic district filled with restaurants, bars, souvenir shops, etc. Cabs are also not lacking. Check-in, however, took awhile. Given that it was holiday season, it would be nice if the hotel had more employees stationed at the check-in counters to speed up the process. The check-in staff were cordial; not over the top courteous but just fine. We found the concierge and restaurant staff to be more pleasant. The decor of this hotel is classic. Perhaps one would even say that the Marriott Stellaris' decor is a little dated. It's not abstract or contemporary. Our room was smaller than expected. The nice thing is that beach chairs are provided for hotel guests. The hotel employees stationed at the beachfront will gladly help carry and set your chairs exactly where you want them to be on the beach.

The Good: - Quick check-in; room ready when we arrived at 1:30pm - Location in Condado on Ashford Ave and a short cab ride to Old San Juan and other areas of interest - Large enough beach for numerous guests (other hotel's beach fronts in Condado have washed away considerably) - Plenty of sundries available for purchase if you forgot something. There is also a Walgreens across the street. The Bad: - Upcharge for an ocean view room - not an issue normally but the rooms smell very bad. Quite musty. - Unfriendly service professionals. This was a theme in Puerto Rico, but when you're paying to stay at a hotel it's bad form to have staff that act bored, annoyed, and like you are a bother to them. - The pool is surrounded by shade due to all of the plam trees put in there to look pretty. It is also not a swimming pool - it's a wading pool that is 2 feet deep all around with fountains in the middle. - The hotel is tall, so there is always a large slice of shade covering the beach and you have to move your chair(s) around to follow the sun and avoid the shade from the hotel tower. - There is always someone screaming at you on the beach: either the guy doing \"massages\" yelling \"Best massage now! Chiropractic! Best massage!\" (this goes on all day) or the ice cream guy who rolls his cart around the beach ringing insanely loud bells to alert you of ice cream availability. - The drinks at the casino are virtually undrinkable. Sure, they're free but really, stay away. (Also, you are not allowed to bring in a nicer glass of wine from the hotel bar). Not that anyone in the casino will offer you a drink anyway - we had to beg to find someone to wait on us after I was told I could not go up to the bar myself to order a drink. - The food at the beach side bar is subpar. I usually ventured off premises to get lunch. - There is a very loud live band that plays every night in the lobby. Since we were on the 3rd floor (one up from the lobby) we heard hte band until they stopped after midnight. The place is OK.

The clerk said it would be $50 or $25 extra per night but we could have a partial view free...which we accepted. I had read but forgotten to request the annex with a view of the pool and the ocean.

The reception person had either shout or wait for us to lipread. Normal conversation was impossible. Plus side....the place is jumping for those looking for late nite activities. For our second stay, I requested a room overlooking the pool, and got this. The room was delightful. We could view not only the pool, but also the ocean, and hear the ocean, which was actually quite loud, with the patio door open. The room was spacious and pool rooms evidently include access to the executive lounge, which was a very nice perk. They put out evening snacks and a light breakfast as well.

The beach was outstanding - well over a couple hundred feet long, nice soft sand, and cleaned every morning.

This place is perfect from start to finish. First let me explain my trip. I visited with my extended family (8 people) and we had 4 rooms all in the tower building. We stayed on the 11th floor and each room was different in size and view. My particular room was partial ocean facing the opposite side of the pool and was very large. Other rooms were ocean view which was a bit smaller, and two city views which were similar in size. Our rooms were ready when we arrived (around 1 pm on Dec 26). We also took advantage of the free buffet every morning which was included in our package. The buffet was your typical hotel breakfast buffet but let me tell you I miss having an omelet prepared for me every morning. Due to its location, we were able to go to the numerous liquor spots/stores and purchase beer (Medella is a great beer), and liquor for our week long trip. We then would use our mini fridge as a holding ground for beer/mixers and bring them down to the lobby bar or the casino to avoid the cost of the drinks in the lobby bar/pool/beach. It did not appear that the staff had any problem with this at all as we were never asked to stop. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OR DON\u00e2\u20ac\u2122T COMPLAIN OF THE COST OF YOUR LIQUOR BILL. The lobby bar is very loud with the band playing almost every night. We tried to stay away from the lobby bar due to the noise however it was not considered a major issue as we avoided it. We sat at the couches near the entrance to the beach almost every night and played games, or enjoyed casual conversation. The casino is nice in size but the staff could be a little friendlier. All depends on the person you get. We had both good and bad experiences in the casino. Other than the casino, the staff was great. All very nice people and ready to help you in any way. We stayed for 7 days and for the first 5 the weather was so-so. This gave us a chance to visit the rainforest, Old San Juan, the Bacardi Factory, and partake in a zip line excursion. The last 2 days were when the weather turned sunny, and we hung out by the pool and the beach. The drinks around the pool are strong and good but can be seen as pricy. The food is just ok but you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect much from a pool bar. The building does block the sun and you will have to move if not in the right spot. We learned that the hard way and the second sunny day we stayed in a spot that saw sun majority of the day. Stay by the black rocks on the side of the beach and you should not have to move at all during the day. But again, you are on vacation so go with the flow and enjoy yourself. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it a bigger problem than it really is. I would recommend this hotel to anyone I talk to thinking about a trip to Puerto Rico. The three major things that I would tell them are to find a liquor store, get in the tower building, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the little things ruin a great trip.

The hotel itself is quite nice, and we did have free upgrade to full ocean view which was a pleasant suprise. Service was good and hotel staff always pleasant. Check in was smooth despite hotel being busy. THE POSITIVES: a great sand beach with big waves (if you like to body surf or bogey board); great location in Condado so you can walk safely to many restaurants and stores; rooms spacious, airey and very quiet at night (we were on an upper floor); large, bright and clean bathroom with strong shower; refrigerator in room and Walgren's 1 block away so easy to keep snacks/drinks handy; extra towels brought and room cleaned promply when we called; very helpful business center that \"bent\" the rules to help us; elevators fast so no waiting which is great for a 20 storey hotel. THE NEGATIVES: surf was rough with strong undertow (only in part due to inclement weather) so small children might have trouble enjoying the ocean here; hotel restaurants not very good (although the coffee shop in lobby has good sandwiches at reasonable price); beds soft; pool fair; few activities other than beach (and one outdoor ping-pong table during constantly windy week); position of tall hotel relative to beach blocks sun for several hours per day, so during a generally overcast days people were moving their beachchairs to different parts of beach to try to get a little sun.

I spent 40 minutes at the unheated, freezing cold pool today waiting for service before I gave up,. A 12oz glass of watery American beer served in a plastic cup costs $8. There are mean-looking security guards everywhere. The neighborhood is boring and not within walking distance of Old San Juan. All of the restuarants are absurdly expensive, and I have lived in Manhattan, East Hanmpton and Santa Barbara. Nothing justifies the ridiculous prices around here, both at the hotel and the local restaurants. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.

Let me start by saying the location was PERFECT!!!!! walking distance to many GREAT restaurants. Starbucks, Hagen Daz and Walgreens across the street. The big problem was with the hotel itself. Most of the staff is friendly, although it can be spotty. We had a corner room that was very spacious, with a lovely balcony facing the pool/beach. However, if you look to your left you see the top of some very old bulidings and an alley. We stayed in the cabana building, I would suggest staying in the tower (much nicer). The room itself was nothing special. I didnt think it was up to Marriot standards or woth the money. The pool area is horrible. There are 2 pools (If Thats what you want to call them). 1 pool has fountains in the middle and is only about 1foot deep. The other is a little deeper with a water slide ( not much deeper). There is no sun by the pool becasue of the palm trees. The pool isnt heated and it was freezing. They have 1 hot tub that was pretty gross. THe beach area is not what i expected. You can't really swim on Condando beach. Its way to rough and unsafe. They had the red flag flying the whole time we were there. There is no lifeguard. There are beach chairs if you can get get somebody to get one for you. They are all pretty old and full of sand. Not much in the way of poolside/beach service. We had to walk up to the bar and order our own drinks. Which btw are very over priced unless you hit happy hour. This is not a resort, other than the casino which is just OK there isnt much to do at the hotel. No activities pretty dead. Do not come here with teenagers they will be bored out of there mind. They show a schedule of activities at the pool, volleyball,yoga, beach bingo. but they never actually had anything. The lobby is made up of a bar with high tops . What a waste of space. The place was dead the whole week we were there. The food is horrible and way over priced.. The tour desk was helpful and we went on some fun excursions. We loved Puerto Rico.

After ordering, we got drinks fairly promptly, but the food took way to long. After our parties food was brought, I was told my food was going to take an extra few minutes (I ordered a Veggie Wrap), the rest of the group order meat (Which should take longer to cook).

Breakfast Buffet is good, though bizarrely priced (you pay extra for an omelet--never seen that before). Ate in the Exec lounge this morning--good fruit, yogurt, pastries, and we ate outside and saw only one pigeon. Lots of decent restaurants in the area, though they are pretty dear--but in a winter resort in December that's hardly a surprise. The front desk operation leaves a lot to be desired. We were arriving ver late, so I called the hotel in late afternoon to confirm our reservation for a high-floor room. When we arrives at 2:00 AM the only room left was on the sixth floor. It can get noisy, with the bass from the bar band penetrating the floor until late. Concierge told us twice that there was no winter league baseball in San Juan. When a second concierge said the same thing I pulled the info up on my phone--at which point the first concierge came by and told her colleague (in Spanish) that she had told me there was no baseball. The second person told her SHE was wrong, and she walked off with no apology. What a jerk. Housekeeping is prompt. Drinks are good and not outrageously priced, especially by resort standards. Overall it's a three-star spot. If all you care about is a spot on the beach, this fits the bill. If you are looking for a luxury resort experience, this isn't the spot.

The hotel is short taxi ride from airport ($15). We were the only one in line when we arrived, so the check in process was relatively short. They didn't have a king that we booked available and told us one would be available in the next couple of days. Our double still had the great ocean view. We stay first on the 15th floor and then the 16th. Both had ocean view balconies and the view was great. Our king was ready as promised in a couple days and they moved our packed up stuff to our new room. The rooms are clean and pretty average. Seemed like any average chain hotel in the us. We spent some time in the lobby lounge and the service was always good. Same could be said for the pool area bar. The pool was way colder that the ocean so we would usually hop in the hot tub for a bit every day before getting ready for dinner. The hot tub didn't look like it got cleaned very often and even was a little gross to me. It wasn't very hot either. The beach and surf is awesome. There is always enough chairs and a waiter/waitress came around once in awhile for drink or food orders. There were only a couple people trying to sell stuff on the beach and they left you alone. All in all, the lobby, pool, and beach area were clean and well taken care of. The motel is located in a great spot for dining. Our favorite was a Japanese steak house down the street called the Cherry Blossom. There was something different for every night from sea food to Italian. We always felt safe walking around the hotel. Rarely did you even go 10 minutes without seeing some sort of law enforcement. While in San Juan, we spent a day touring old San Juan. It's a interesting piece of history and the old stone forts are fun to walk through. We also did two tours through the hotel. We did the BioBay tour which is amazing and the El Yunque rain forest tour. I would recommend both and both went off without a hitch. Pickup and delivery from the hotel made it very simple.

We slept with the patio door open the entire time and hearing the waves was money. Don't eat near the resort, it's tempting but it's not worth the price or quality.

It took me a couple of days to warm up to the city and hotel. I am used to a more quiet/rural resort atmosphere. In the end, did not want to leave! The hotel was very clean, our room was very clean. Plenty of towels,hot water,amenities provided daily. We were in room 1010 and had a beautiful view of the beach. The beach water was warm, but a bit rough. Had sun every day and 84 degrees. We saw a lot of kids surfing with boards and jumping waves. Having a great time. Had breakfast buffet one morning and a dinner one evening in Tuscany. Breakfast buffet was fine and dinner was also very good. We also had lunch at the beach bar and that was fine as well. The pool bar was a bit to be desired though.. Needs a bit of updating. Coolers were old and rusty looking. Could use a revamp. Can tell they just recently built the beach bar/restaurant but should not ignore the pool bar. There was music at the pool bar, but it was from the bartenders IPOD station...and one TV. You could not see the tv if you were sitting at the swim up bar. The bartender made good drinks though...Oh, and one note: They take no cash at the beach restaurant and pool bar. Have credit card with you or charge every drink/food to your room. The hot tub was clearly posted with a sign that stated no children allowed in hot tub. That was completely ignored and every day there were at least 15 children and adults in the hot tub. Some children so young they were in swim diapers! We opted to stay out of the hot tub! Too bad they don't adhere to the rules. Or have a relaxing adult only hot tub, minus the diapers! The pool was very nice and was very clean and enjoyable. Great waitstaff at the pool and the beach. Could have used some live music at the pool to make it a bit more festive. Just for a few hours in the afternoon for happy hour and maybe some activities going on throughout the day. It was a bit quiet. They have activities posted, but didn't see a coordinator going around to get things started. The Lobby bar and bands in the lobby in the evening were the best. A lot of activity and people coming to dance and listen to the band in the evenings. Great Fun! Offered dance lessons earlier in the evening. That was nice. Great atmosphere. The casino was small but offered enough slots/tables to keep you happy.We saw a few jackpots hit. Later, that night we hit a jackpot ourselves, So that made it all the more fun. So you do see people winning in their casino.. Overall, this is a great family hotel, also nice for couples as well. We had a very nice four night getaway .

I expected to be further away from the city then what we were and to my surprise we were smack dead in the city and it was very poor looking, plus cops were on every corner. The hotel is mainly for older crowds; not geared toward younger crowds at all. No hip hop or R&B in sight. It did seem to have the best and largest beach on the strip, from what I saw. The beach was nice, as well as the free chairs and umbrellas. The room was nice and a decent size. Due to my research in advance, I requested the main tower, since the reviews stated that the main tower was updated. We received the end unit, which included 2 huge balconies on each side. One for the city view and one for the partial beach view and this was a great view and there was no need to pay the extra daily fee for the beach view. The city view wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something to look at in awe, it was all poor and nothing to brag about. The one thing we had a complaint about was the uncomfortable beds and over used pillows with no cushion or fluff at all. Just flat as soon as you lay on it and we woke up every morning in pain from the bed! There are no TV channels but fortunately we brought our portable DVD player and hooked it up to the TV. Definitely not a party city at all. Mainly a spot to just chill and relax. For transportation we used the public transportation and taxi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The bus did take forever but it was only 75 cents. The streets are awful. If you want to rent a vehicle, I would only do so if you are planning to venture out and I would only rent for a day or 2 and rely on public transportation for the rest. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drive to Old San Juan. You will be in traffic on their 1 way narrow streets forever! Save on money from the rental and parking at hotel. Many spots were in a reasonable distance. The streets are so narrow and small and everyone drives like a crazy person; even the bus driver! We mainly stayed on our little strip. Wish we went further out to sightsee so that we could have seen the beautiful part of PR because from what we saw it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that beautiful. When you have been to Hawaii and Aruba, you expect that all the time but it was still a great trip and it was very relaxing. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really cater to visitors. You need a translator while there because no one speaks English and everything is written in Spanish. Every time you talked to some one, they never understood you. Old San Juan is a good shopping spot but very crowded and the streets are worst there. Over all we had a great time. They did have this Japanese restaurant across from the Walgreens, next to the hotel and it was very good! There are a few good eating spots on the strip as well. The weather was perfect but the waves were very rough. The pool is very small and it think it only goes up to 3ft. That was a bummer. I would visit again, a few years from now and only for the purpose of venturing out to sightsee the beautiful spots that I was told about. Also be prepared to spend because it s very expensive and it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be, especially since it isn't the most beautiful location. Fortunately we had a $200.00 credit to use at the hotel. Saved us some money. Also if you are a rewards member, take advantage of the Pent House Executive Lounge. They have great continental breakfast, evening finger foods and desserts( Free) and unfortunately we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find this out until a day before we left.

I had a city view room on the 20th floor that, if I craned my neck, allowed me to see the beach. (As a platinum member, I was supposed to have an upgrade but the hotel was fairly full and I can't complain given that I had a high floor). The room was good-sized, with a chaise lounge, flat screen TV with many channels, and a nice-sized bathroom. Nothing special but also nothing to complain about. Room amenities include a mini-fridge (no mini-bar) and free bottled water daily. Room was very quiet and elevators were generally prompt. The concierge lounge is large but not as \"personal\" as I've found lounges at other Marriott hotels. Still, there is a nice breakfast, evening desserts, and a cash bar as well as a computer where you can print out your boarding pass. The main lobby bar is bustling in the evening. I ate at Tuscany -- prices were OK, service was attentive, but the food was only average. However, there are many and varied restaurants a very short walk from the hotel, so lots of choices. The location of the Marriott is a big plus as compared to other luxury hotels in San Juan which are a bit more isolated. The lobby store (sundries) is supposed to be open until 10 p.m. but was routinely closed around 8. There is on-site parking and valet service was extremely prompt. The concierge desk was always crowded, so never stuck around to use it. Because I was here on business, I didn't use the beach, pool, or other amenities. Overall, the Marriott is a \"safe\" choice. I can't say it's exceptional in any area, but I also experienced zero problems. If you're coming as a business traveler, it's a good choice.

I booked here because I got a good deal and I wanted a hotel on the ocean. I was impressed by the attentiveness of the staff. They were all very friendly and helpful. I got a Cabana room on the second floor which faced the two pools and the ocean. The room was basic and clean although it had the usual nicks and dirty spots on the walls which one would expect. The pool stays open until 11:00 pm playing music that seeps into the room so if you are an early sleeper you might want to ask for a room in the tower. I read a review that said the main Lounge attracts locals as well as guests. I've seen many hotels tout this same message only to find an empty bar but not so here. Saturday and Sunday nights were packed with both locals and guests. They had a band playing music and an instructor giving dance lessons early in the evening. Monday night it was empty. The casino was much bigger than expected. 24 tables of various games, all were open and full on the weekend nights. The beach and pool areas were clean and well staffed. There is a tour service booth inside the hotel which you can book trips to the rainforest, Old San Juan or the Bacardi rum tour. I ate in their Tuscany restaurant my last night. It was typical of the higher end hotel restaurants. The food and service were good but pretty much unmemorable for me. I didn't eat at either two of the hotels other restaurants, use the spa or the fitness center so I can't review those. Outside and surrounding area. The hotel is in the Candado tourist area along the northern coast just east of Old San Juan. The taxi trip from the airport was fixed at $14. Stepping out of the lobby brings you onto Ashford street. There are Walgreens both east and west. I would recommend the one east (make a right) of the hotel it was much bigger and cleaner. Either direction on Ashford will bring you to a good selection of restaurants and bars. If local food is for you I would suggest the Latin Star. Open 24 hrs just east of the hotel and next to the Walgreens. It's a dive, the service can be slow but the menu has plenty of local dishes. If you care not for ambiance and time is of no concern I recommend trying it out. I walked to Old SanJuan but it took longer than the 35 minutes they said it would take. Head east and keep the shore on your right. it took about 45 to 50 minutes. Taxi back from Old San Juan cost me $15.

The view was terrific. Upgrade to an ocean view. -The beach iteself seemed ok. I've never actually done the whole beach vacation thing (this was my first trip ever to an island!) so I went in thinking white sands and miles of it. Condado beach is not huge and it's probably not the best beach on the island. It did serve its purpose though-was usually not that crowded, the water was warm, and there were chairs and umbrellas available -The Italian restaurant was good and reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant. -The bar downstairs in the lobby had some great bartenders. Go down and have a cocktail (the snack mix was kind of strange-it had croutons in it or something) -A nice, big busy gym that's open 24 hours. State of the art machines and a good free weight section. Cons: Housekeepers were adorably sweet and kind, but the room wasn't really as clean as I'd like it. Hairs in the bathroom upon arrival, and a wet facecloth stuck to the shower curtain. There was only one restaurant open that I could tell. The other might have been, but it was under construction and I couldn't find it. Gates to the beach were usually closed by dark and heavily guarded. There were abandoned and ramshackle buildings on both sides. Strange place for a resort, I thought. The pools were tiny, and I thought there would be an adults only pool that had a swim up bar. The pool with the swim up bar was kid friendly. All in all, the stay was good enough, and I'd recommend it but stress my cons.

The beach is fantastic w/ guys who will help you w/ chairs, drinks, umbrellas. Stunning views. I know this is standard at the resorts but the staff was always friendly w/o seeming fake. Pool was very nice but I would have preffered a little more supervision of the kids doing backflips @9pm off the side of the hot tub. Restaurants not bad, not great. Little cigar, jewelry, craft stands set up during the day are very nice and affordable if you don't want to go back into Old San Juan for last minute shopping.

During the vaca, I decided to walk down to the Conrad to check it out, since it's about a 10 minute walk away. I did a quick walk through of the lobby bar, gift shop and the casino which is located on the second floor. The Conrad was a little too modern for me and felt a little cold. I made a wise decision with the Marriott. Length of Stay: Sunday, September 5 to Wednesday, September 8 Below are short reviews of the things visited at the resort. If I go back, without a doubt I would stay here again. Room Arrived around 12 to find the room not ready. I expected this because check in is not until 4. I was offered the use of the spa to change and told that I could be contacted via cell phone when my room was ready. Took the cab into Old San Juan and did some shopping there. Received a phone call around 4 that the room was ready. Had a room on the 18th floor with a city view. Small fridge and coffee maker. Bathroom with tub and toiletries from Bath and Body Works. All in all a nice clean room. The hotel is about a one minute walk from a 24 hour Walgreens and there are several fast food and regular restaurants nearby. Directly across the street is a Starbucks and ice cream place. To the right of the hotel is a Wendy's, Subway and Dunkin Donuts. To the left is a Burger King, Subway, another Walgreens, Uno (pizza place) and Fuddruckers. Also there are several restaurants nearby. Transportation Be prepared to pay for taxis. Cost from airport to hotel is $16. Cost to Old San Juan is $14 and the cost to the mall, Plaza Los Americas is $15. There is a bus that will take you to downtown San Juan and the bus stop is a few yards from the hotel, but after waiting for close to 30 minutes, gave up and took a taxi. I knew from ready other posts, that there was not a set schedule. Food at Hotel Only ate one meal at the hotel, at La Vista. Wanted something quick to eat before lunch and had a plaintain stuffed with ground beef appetizer. It was $9 and a diet coke was $3. Had a great drink at the huge lobby bar, don't remember the price. And usually the pool bar has some type of drink special between 4-6. Beach/Pool Beach is great with lounge chairs/umbrellas. The pool is also nice with plenty of chairs. Business Center 4-5 computers for use and printing available for a price. If you need to print a boarding pass, you may do so at a printer especially for boarding passes at a small kiosk before you get to the lobby. Fitness Center Used this every day, great treadmills, bikes, free weights. Also fruit and tea available. Added bonus - cold towels for use after a workout.

There was no chef cooking eggs, just metal bins with cold scrambeled eggs, cold bacon, cold grits which looked like cup cakes, and cold sausage links. Sure they had toast and fruit but its way to expensive for the overall quality. If I had to pay cash I would have been really pissed.

This has been out third stay in 4 years. We stood in 2007,2008 and now in 2010 and it just keep getting better and better. I will like to say that I was a little concerned about staying at this hotel again when I was going to book my reservation back in May this year because of some negative reviews that I had been reading back then. I know that it is almost impossible to please every guest that stays at any given hotel because there will always be something that someone will pick on regardless how much the hotel will try to go out of their way to please their guests. I know this for a fact since I work more or less in the same type industry where I have to try to keep happy almost 1,000 tenants in a private owned complex of 21 buildings in Queens, New York and there is always someone who is never happy no matter how much you try to do so. However before making the reservation I decided to place a call to the hotel and speak to the Manager Representative Mr. Julian Cable Treadwell. He was not available at the time so I left him a message and within an hour Mr.Treadwell was nice enough to returned my phone call and we spoke for a few minutes. I expressed to him my concerns about the hotel and he assured that my concerns had been corrected and that I will enjoy once again my stay at the San Juan Marriott Resort. I have to admit that after speaking to Mr. Treadwell I felt so confident that I went ahead and booked my reservation to stay at the hotel for the third time. It has been another great decision to stay here again. The complete hotel staff have always made us feel like family. From Willie and Gilbert (parking attendants) at the front when you arrive who always greet you with a wide smile and right away help you with your luggage. They make you feel as if you have come back to your home away from home. We didn't have to wait to check in. We went straight to the front desk and were met by Stephanie who had such a beautiful smile.She welcomed us to the hotel and helped us get the best room that we were pleased with. She was able to accomodate us on the 18th floor with a pool/ocean view room. She was so helpful and nice to us that we want to say , \"thank you Stephanie.\" We went up to our room #1805 and were so happy with it because first of the spectacular view of the Ocean/Pool and the Condado area and second because of the cleanliness and comfortable beds and spacious rooms that we know that this hotel is cable of providing for their guests. As we expected the bathroom was spotless clean with plenty of towels. First thing we did was to jump on those comfortable beds. They are the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on. We went out for dinner the first night and after returning to our room there was a knock on the door and after opening the door to see who it was, there was a waiter with a wonderful welcoming gift for us from the hotel compliments of the Marketing Administrative Assistant,Miss Melissa Delgado. I had the great pleasure of talking to Miss Melissa Delgado a few days prior to my departure to Puerto Rico just to make sure that everything was in order with my reservation and she assured me that everything was just as schedule with my reservation and that if there was any problems at check in to please contact her right away. I specially want to say, \"thank you so much Miss Melissa Delgado\" for such a wonderful welcoming gift and having the pleasure of meeting you in person. Your professionalism and dedication to the San Juan Marriott Hotel and their guests is greatly appreciated. The hotel is always looking to be better year after year. Right now they are in the process of finishing remodeling La Vista Restaurant which is located in the ground level next to their other Restaurant,Tuscany Italian Restaurant. We didnt get to eat at Tuscany because of lack of time but I heard from other guests at the hotel that the food was excellent. The Hotel is located in the heart of the Condado area. In front of the hotel accross the street is a Starbucks and Hagen Daz. To the right of the Hotel just a block away is a 24 hours Wallgreens which we went to pack munchies,water,juice and sodas since each room in the hotel is equipped with a mini fridge for your convenience. If you continue to the right of the hotel in another two blocks you will find Wendys,Pure and Natural,and Basking Robbins besides a number of restaurants that serve local Puerto Rican food. To the left of the hotel you will find more restaurant such as Yerbabuena,Danny's International Pizzeria,Burger King,FuddRuckers and many others which I can't remember the names. If you want to wonder off the Condado area an try local food I will suggest to go to Pinones area. It is right behind the airport and an area which its known for its many Kiosks which offer many fried delicacies of Puerto Rico. I highly recommned to go to Mi Casita. There We had the best Fried Red Snapper with Tostones and salad that we had in the many places that we tried this dish. Please do not expect a high end restaurant with Air Conditioning. It is an open Kiosk near the ocean but the food its amazing! If you want go for a ride then travel east to the town of Luquillo via Route #3 and try Pasta Y Pueblo. Right now they have 57 reviews (not counting mine yet)and they are all positives. We are talking about the best Mahi Mahi I have ever tried!! and trust me that I have eaten this fish in New York many times in a lot of high end restaurants and they do not come close! Their coconut rice is to die for. Their pineapple flan was delicious. We wanted to try this shack/kiosk type restaurant after reading so many reviews and they were not wrong. They deserve all the positive reviews!! Do not be fool by the look of the place. This is what we call a hole in the wall place.There is only 5 tables and no ac. It is about half a block of the beach so you always get a breeze.They open from 5pm until 11pm . It is run by the owner Freddy and his wife and they are the most friendliest people you want to come across. Freddy comes out to greet you and to ask you if you were please with the food and to chat with every customer for a few minutes to find out were you are visiting from. In all I have to say that my family and I had a great time in Puerto Rico the 8 days that we were there. As always our stay at the San Juan Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino has been a wonderful one. On Monday August 30 Hurricane Earl was passing near Puerto Rico and the hotel management handle the situation with the utmost professionalism making sure every guests was secure and at the same time comfortable considering that most of the Condado area that afternoon and night was completely shut down. The dedication,friendliness and professionalism that my family and I I have witnessed from all the employees and staff at this hotel is the best one that I have ever experienced in any other hotel that I have stay in Puerto Rico. I never heard one complaint from any of the guests that were staying at the hotel that I had the opportunity to talk to. I spoke to many guests whether at the pool,beach, bar or at the front of the hotel wating for my car. They were all very happy that they chose this hotel and in fact many of them assured me that they will choose this hotel again when coming to Puerto Rico. I will continue to make the San Juan Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino my home away from home when traveling to Puerto Rico and I will Highly recommend it to all my family and friends. To all the staff at the hotel and specially to Mr. Treadwell and Melissa Delgado, thank you so much for making us feel at home again. It was a great pleasure staying at your hotel again. We look forward to see you again in the near future!", "Date": "September 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guimaraes, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cNot great but/and not awfull\u201d", "Author": "vmimartins", "ReviewID": "UR79357814", "Content": "Sometimes it seems like we aren't talking about the same place. This hotel can get great and lousy comments... so here is my opinion. The Marriott San Juan Resort & Stellaris Casino is an old 4* hotel. We arrive late (11 PM) so we didn't get any trouble in check in. The lobby is huge as it has a bar in the middle \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Some nights there is a live band on the lobby and is quite noisy... really noisy but, it's the Caribbean and we were in holidays... so no complain as in our room there was no sound at all. We upgraded to a ocean/swimming view room and the room was really big maybe because it was a room for disabled. No bad smell, clean and yes the decor is dated. Didn't try any restaurants in the hotel... there are so much of them outside \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The swimming pool and beach are nice but not overwhelming . There were always chairs available and the service was a bit slow. There was some construction going on a restaurant by the pool but it was almost unnoticed. We didn't try the casino so cant give any info about it. The hotel was in a great location and there are always taxis available outsidel. Can also get the bus to Old San Juan just outside the hotel (21C). We would stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone staying in San Juan for a nice stay.

My first was this past December 2009. Since the purpose of that December trip was all pleasure and the purpose of this recent September 2010 trip was all business I can give you my thoughts from both perspectives. I'll start off with the December trip and then simply add anything that needs to be said relating to business travel at the end of the review. Consider the comments otherwise to apply to both trips. The short story is that this is a wonderful property. The December 2009 stay was purely for pleasure with my Wife for our annual week of where should we go and where should we stay with the Marriott brand. I'm a Platinum, so I do get to stay at many of Marriott's properties and I can tell you that this property is an excellent choice for either business or pleasure trips. Check in and check out is down to a science at this property and was very friendly and easy. Room: The first room was very nice and was a corner room facing the east and ocean view. We wanted the West and ocean view and we were able to change after the first night. Bathrooms are not as large as some other resort only properties, but are large enough that you shouldn't have any issues when traveling with two in a room. Add two other kids and you might find it tight if everyone wants the bathroom at once. The room itself is very spacious, maybe not as large as some other resort only properties, but still my rooms were very nice and spacious. The balcony gives you enough room to relax and enjoy the view of the beach and ocean. Corner rooms have two balconies which is nice. Plenty of windows for an open spacious feel. Housekeeping was excellent and not one complaint. No musty smell in the room either trip. Elevators were speedy and always working. This property really rocks in the Bar / Casino area of the main lobby starting Thursday evenings through the weekend. To say the lobby / Bar area is alive is an understatement. Not a negative at all, just the place is alive with locals and guests enjoying life and if you want to get away from the activity you can. Reading past reviews I would agree that requesting a room above the 8th floor would be a safe bet to make sure the noise from the lobby doesn't hit your room. Just ask the front desk and they'll know where to put you if a concern. Keep in mind if you have a car there will be a parking fee of $16 per day self park. The parking lot is connected to hotel for easy access. Go to the Quick pay window anytime to have your ticket validated with payment so you can leave when you are ready. Do this early in the morning before any lines, which I didn't experience. You will also be charged a $15.00 +/- resort fee which I believe includes some bottled water in your room, beach chairs, and probably some other stuff which I don't recall. This vacation trip was on points and they didn't charge the resort fee on top of the rewards points which is the right thing to do and so appreciated. Concierge Level: This property has a concierge level and is the Penthouse top floor. This is unusual being that most Marriott Resorts do not offer a concierge level and are usually only offered at their business non resort full service Marriott properties. Check with the hotel for hours of operation. Having access to the concierge level is a bonus when you are on vacation. You should consider getting an upgrade with access to the concierge if you don't qualify for complimentary access as a Marriott rewards member. It's a great place to simply sit out on the terrace for a great view of the city and the beach, read a book, watch the sunset, and enjoy the complimentary food and beverages. The breakfast offers plenty for a quick start breakfast. The evening food service is excellent. Every evening there's a nice selection of heavy horderves, e.g. Beef Wellington, imitation crab pasta salad (imitation, yes, but the best in any case), meat paella, and of course excellent deserts later in the evening. Enough offered if you want to skip going out for a full dinner and just enjoying the sunset from the balcony and relaxing. The automatic espresso machine is available throughout the day. Note: You are not supposed to take food from the concierge level and I can totally understand the practice being that it's primarily a resort hotel vs a business property. No explanation needed!! That said, I've never had anyone stop me when taking my morning latte out for a walk to the beach to watch the sun rise. I think it's either Tuesday or Wednesday night they have a Manager's reception and the food selection is kicked up another notch. Complimentary beer and wine that evening. Beach: The water tends to be a little rough and on both the December stay and most recent September stay you can always see a red flag as you enter the beach. Keep in mind a hurricane just pasted Puerto Rico (September 2010) and just be aware of tides, waves, currents, etc. Use your head and pay attention to the local warnings and you shouldn't have anything to worry about. This would apply anywhere you go. on vacation. IMPORTANT: There happens to be a group of large black rocks off to the west side of the beach property. You can't miss them. Don't think you can play around near those rocks and not risk getting severly hurt. During our December stay a women got a bit too close to those rocks and got pounded into the rocks and had to get pulled ashore. An ambulance was needed. I believe she was eventually OK, but the you need to respect those rocks. We noticed lots of body surfing and swimmers throughout the stay and otherwise no problems with the beach and water. The sand is wonderful; very fine, clean, and pleasant to the feet. You can take a nice walk on the beach either going west towards the Renaissance or to the east where you will see more wind surfing and more local beach goers. (Renaissance is another nice Marriott property - very different in look and feel) Casino: What can I tell you, it's a casino. Note that they do deal blackjack a bit differently, but I believe they always have at least one table where they deal more mainland US. It's a nice casio if you feel like making that kind of a donation to the Marriott property. Local Beach Area to get out your snorkeling equipment: There's a very nice small beach about a 20 minute walk from the hotel. The beach is nicely protected from the ocean by breakers and this is where I went to snorkel a few times during the trip. You won't see really large fish species, but there are plenty of different fish to see and is very convenient to the property. You could hop on the bus if you don't want to walk. To get to this beach, just walk outside the hotel and go right on Ashford, that's going west. This is probably not an area where a seasoned snorkler would make an effort to visit, but I enjoyed the snorking at this beach. Take a few beach towels with you for the beach and to dry off. I'm not going to discuss too much about shopping, what you can see and do in Puerto Rico because I'm sure many of the past reviews have lots of info. Here are some quick tips that I think will be of help. There's a Walgreens just down the block and liquor store a few blocks to the east on Ashford and one going west closer to the Renaissance Hotel. Other Tips: 1) Old San Juan: Go to Old San Juan of course. Take the public transportation, the bus just outside of the hotel and take it to the bus depot in Old San Juan. Then I suggest you hop on the FREE trolley system that will take you all over Old San Juan including to El Moro, the fort. What we did was simply ride around on the free trolley to get an idea of what we wanted to do, where to get off and spend time, etc. The fort is worth it, how can you not. There's another fort, Fort San Cristobal, which you can add on to your ticket to see that fort too, but we passed. I'm thinking if you have the time and like forts, you should do it. 2) Check with the hotel if any local art fairs, etc. during your stay: We were lucky to hit a local art fair that was taking place about 1/2 between the hotel and Old San Juan. We actually wound up walking there from the hotel and it's a bit of a walk, but very doable. The fair took place in the Parque Mua Oz Rivera and Sixto Escobar Stadium area. 3) Shopping: There's plenty to shop in Old San Juan. Some of the street vendors will be selling their goods, which will include sterlings silver. Just make sure the silver has the seal that it's real. Not saying anyone is trying to cheat. My wife bought a nice pendant and was very happy with the price and quality. There's a Marshall's in town too. 4) Restaurants: You can get lots of recommendations from past reviews or books, etc. Tip: Cheap tip - there's a Burger King a few clocks east of the hotel on Ashford and if you are looking to save or on a budget, you can order your favorite burger and take to the beach for a cheap eats vs spending a lot at the hotel. Save the bucks for a nice dinner. Lots of local restaurants east and west of the hotel on Ashford. Pizza at Danny's is very reasonable and the pizza was good. We took out one evening and brought back to our room to chill out and relax. Just make sure you check the pizza before you leave the restaurant as they either didn't understand what I wanted or simply gave me the wrong pizza. Can happen anywhere. Here's a wonderful restaurant frequented by locals: If you have a car, which we didn't on this trip, I highly recommend this local restaurant in Guaynabo. The restaurant is Pez Dorado Marisqueria, located in Caparra Shopping Center, Ave Roosevelt, Guaynabo, PR 00968, Phone: -------. I'm fortunate to now have clients in San Juan so I really enjoy going to local places, vs what you see as a tourist. This restaurant is an easy drive from the hotel and is worth the trip if you enjoy excellent seafood, at reasonable prices. This is a restaurant that you'd never think of going to because not in the mainstream of the tourist district. I've been to this restaurant twice and has quickly become a favorite of mine period. Ask at the hotel if you have any questions about the neighborhood, taxi transportation, etc. The owners and servers at this restaurant are fabulous and I feel part of the local family when I go. Business Trip Notes: Simply a wonderful experience to mix business with a little R&R. As a Marriott Platinum you will not be disappointed if you choose to stay at this property. Look for whatever special rates the hotel is offering. Parking and resort fees are extra, but not a show stopper to stay here. Concierge access is a no brainer. Too tired to go eat at the restaurant after a long business day, just spend the evening on the concierge level to relax, munch on the excellent dinner quality food, and maybe take out the laptop or smartphone to get some work done. This property allows you the best of both worlds. Typical concierge hours and says of operation, with access all day for coffee. The GM runs an excellent operation and hospitality is number one with all the staff.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNever, Ever Again\u201d", "Author": "laellabella", "ReviewID": "UR79165770", "Content": "Overall, it was not a good experience.

After we complained, finally, they moved us to a room in the newer tower (and we are platinum Marriot rewards members, so technically, we should have automatically been put in one of the ocean view rooms in the new tower, but they just neglected to do so for some reason). The newer room was better, but still old and smaller than expected. Bottom line -- the reviews and web site for this place are misleading. It is not at all what it purports to be. Turned out that the pool area was much smaller than anticipated, and only one of the restaurants at the place was open for business. At night, it touted itself as a gourmet Italian restaurant, but the food was Chef-Boyardee caliber at best (but still at gourmet prices). In the morning, it offers an over-priced breakfast buffet, where the food is cold (when it should hot) and overall is sub par. Plus, the staff were, for the most part, rude and difficult to deal with.

We loved our ocean-front room. We were a little bummed we didn't get a king size bed, we got two double's instead, but it wasn't a big deal. The beds were super comfortable and appreciated other comforts such as in-room robes, coffee and water. We loved the swim-up bar! Drinks are a little expensive. $9 for a Pina Colada. But, we felt that it was worth it to have a fun drink in the pool or at the beach. Staff graciously hands out complimentary towels and bring chairs and umbrellas out on the beach for you. They had a DJ playing in the early evening (during happy hour especially) which could be a little loud. Not ideal for reading a book and relaxing, but can be fun. If you want to relax/read a book, you can do it during the day when the DJ isn't playing. We didn't eat at the hotel because there are a ton of great restaurants on Ashford Avenue. Miro (across the street from the hotel) and recommended by the concierge was our favorite. There was some construction going on during our stay, but that's to be expected since we visited in the \"off season.\" We didn't try the casino.

I have only been to two other Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in worse condition than what this property was in. One has lost its branding and I am not sure of the other's current status; it was the Renaissance in West Chicago. I could not even make it one hour there before having to depart. Let me assure you that I should have departed this San Juan property as quickly as I checked in, even perhaps a bit quicker than that took. I will be doing bullets for the list of issue that I can recall starting from check in. 1. Room not ready at 2:30 PM. Not a problem since check in is at 4:00 PM. Finally received room keys at 5:45 PM. We did finally get lounge access after speaking to three different people; it was definitely not offered to us by the young lady whom checked us in, she was rather short with us and rude. 2. Concierges\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lounge has an overwhelming smell of mold and mildew that set my allergies off the minute I entered. There was no relief from this all week. I would have to say that they are in need of an extensive air handling systems cleaning, new drapes and carpeting to overcome this issue. I also witnessed the air return cover being opened and the filter being removed directly over all the food items that were out for breakfast one morning. I'm not so sure this is at all sanitary and it was done by William, from their engineering department, as they were trying to make it colder in the lounge. They did seem to do that for them. 3. Keys were brought to us around 5:45, we went to the room it was of decent size and the views were great. However, it had the same moldy mildew smell as the lounge did. I was offered to change rooms but figured the entire property must have an issue with mold and mildew and it did. I requested speaking to the GM and after 4 calls and two days of requesting this I received a call from what seemed like a rushed person whom did not want to listen to anything I had to say Hans something was his entire name I was able to make out. I was finally brought, after three days of asking, a filtration machine for the air quality in the room. Speaking of the air, it was set on the lowest cooling setting the entire week and never really cooled the room to an expectable sleeping temperature. They did come and look at it and gave me some line about the chillers are not being able to cool any better due to the temperature outside but in every other area of the hotel the air temperature was never an issue or was repaired if it were. 4. The room was in need of new drapes, valances, carpet, and a fresh coat of paint. I believe the drapes were a huge part of the odor problem as dust would fall off them when moved and there was a thick layer of dust on the valances as if they have never seen a vacuum or steam cleaner. I have photos of the room condition, so if you would like to provide an email or ftp link I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d gladly send them along to you. Shower worked in the bathroom but the tub did not, although you were able to fill it with the shower head. One could bathe even though the lever for the spout was not functioning. I told engineering that this needed repaired but that it could wait until I departed. It seems that the daily housekeeping is going to depend on who is working your floor that day; some days were great yet others did not exist. 5. I noticed, also, that the balcony was dilapidated on the ocean side of the room and was too scary to venture out onto since it seemed like it was breaking away from the building. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure it is most likely sound enough to go out on the balcony, but just looked unsafe. 6. My wife was bitten multiple times by something unseen I cannot confirm it was from bed bugs but it is my speculation. I have photographs of the bits if you wish to see them. 7. I had my laptop plugged into an outlet on the right side of the bed to charge it and when I touched the charger, it was hot enough to slightly burn the tips of my fingers instantly. This had never happened before. The battery was also extremely hotter then normal so I discontinued the use of that plug and notified maintenance. They had multiple people come and examine the outlet and said they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a problem with it but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want me to use it for my PC any longer which was a no brainer, however now it seems like my PC doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to hold a charge on the battery so seems like it had somewhat of an adverse effect on the PC. My son charged his using the lamp on the desk and never had a problem. That is where I switched to for my PC after the issue and the charger never got over heated in that outlet. I know of at least one other family that had a similar issue at your property while we were there and their daughter's PC had to get a new battery and charging cord. Not sure what the family's name was, but I just know he was part of the lighting crew for the movie crew of the Fast and the Furious Five. 8. I had very few meals here since the more frustrated I became, the less I wanted to spend a dime here. I had the lunch buffet one day and it was not very appetizing. The hot items were not at any rate but the cold items were enjoyable. The Red Snapper was over cooked and full of bones as if someone never fileted a fish before. The Pork Loin was dry from sitting and not having enough sauce in the dish with it to keep it moist. The chicken breast were the only hot entr\u00c3\u00a9e that was consumable and enjoyable to eat. My wife and son had burgers and fries and they were hot and tasty. I was even charged on my bill for something from the pool bar yet I never even used the pool bar. The $10.60 wasn't a big deal but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the point. Like being billed for internet and having to call and have it removed. Same with the local calls that I was told platinum didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for. In general, everything here seem like a hassle and work when it should be relaxing and stress-free. 9. I feel I need to comment on the attitude of the employees. Nearly all are very short, some outright rude to speak with or obtain information from and become defensive when you ask them questions. I never, in my life, have seen six people needed to run the Concierges\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lounge and it, still, having an issue with running out of food. Tables have been left dirty all while they surf the net or talk and eat in the kitchen or take smoke breaks on the balcony. I will say that one attendant seemed to be trying much more so than the others. He was helpful and courteous at all times and that was Johan. I would say he is one of the few employees there that I feel is what I consider Marriott standards. But obviously my view and expectations are much higher than their GM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and other members of management there, to whom I cannot find many gracious things to say about either. So I say More Training for all of them seems to be in order. I could have sworn this was a franchised property. I would not recommend this property to anyone I know in its current state and wish I had never experienced it either. Perhaps I will try the JW Marriott Coco Beach Resort & Spa, Puerto Rico next time I come there. 10. I could go on and on about the negatives but I think that some positive comments are in order as well. The grounds are well kept and the pool was in decent shape most days. The Bellmen were always friendly and polite and the lobby looks amazing. The wait staff at the restaurants were always friendly, helpful, and courteous. We had a nice early dinner; the seared tuna and skirt steak were both very nice and the property seems to attract a nice mix of people. We always felt safe and secure while there. The bottom line is that you have a serious mold/mildew and electrical issues at this property and both are potential dangerous to your guest and the workers at this facility. There is also structural damage to the facing of the building on the balcony overlooking the ocean and this could potential become a falling concrete hazard to guest below near the bar and beach to pool courtyard. This could be an isolated instance on my balcony or could be a wide spread issue, I would have it inspected regardless if it is just the balcony off room 1909 or many others that are effected as it would only take one large piece of concrete debris spalling off and hitting a guest below that would result in serious injury or perhaps death! Please look into this matter urgently, I can provide pictures of the damage area if need. I feel as if I should be given back my Marriott reward points for this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stay so my family and I can take the vacation were expecting this one to be. http://www.ehow.com/about_5075172_dangers-mold-mildew.html http://www.arfamilies.org/health_nutrition/topics/air.htm http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/insidest.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedbug", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rahway, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "Bunnymay", "ReviewID": "UR78285971", "Content": "I've read many reviews about this hotel and the comments made me very concern.

We had breakfast included in our rate and the buffet was very substantial. The casino attached is quite small, but it seems to get a lot of customers. The bar in the lobby was fantastic, and they had salsa music and dancing one of the nights we were there. The hotel is located on a street that has lots of restasurants and places to eat. There is a walgreens about 1 monute walk away, which is like a pharmacy/supermarket - very cheap and very handy! We took a taxi to Old San Juan and this only cost us $15USD - the rate was pre-organised once we got in the cab - all taxis in San Juan seem to do this. Old San Juan is lovely! Its colourful and easy to navigate by yourself. I do recomend doing a proper tour for San Christobel and La Fortaliza as you will get so much more out of it than if you just look around yourselves, we combined ours with a tour of the Bacardi factory, which was really interesting! The Hotel is right on the beach, and you can get sunloungers put on the beach for you. Unfortunatley the water was very rough when we were there, and after about 10 mins of being hit by huge waves we didnt go back in the water. The pool is ok - it is very shallow, and the swim up bar was always closed when we were there, which was a little disappointing. However there is a pretty good waterslide which all the kids at the hotel seemed to enjoy greatly.

Having left the cruise ship at 10am, we were aiming to stay at this highly rated Marriott so we could get some R&R and spoil ourselves a little bit longer before returning home. We have been to numerous islands and stayed at many fine resorts. This was not a resort by any definition we are accustomed to. Early check in was not available,and the service at the front desk was intolerably slow and unfriendly whenever we asked for a status check. The hotel did not look much at all like the pictures on the internet. It is quite old, the casino is small, but the pool area and the beach area are very nice. We were able to use the facilities while we were waiting fo our room, so we took advanage of that. The hotel bars and restaurants were very expensive. I ordered a diet coke at the pool bar and paid $3 for a 16 oz plastic cup of the fountain drink. A bottled water at the pool will cost you $3 and most of the alcoholic drinks are $8 and up. Fortunately, there are enough dining options and bars within walking distance of the hotel. We also found a grocery store about a block from the hotel, where we bumped into other hotel patrons that were stocking up on milk, water and other staples (there is a mini fridge in the room, a huge plus). We got an ocean view hotel room with a balcony, which was very nice. The bathroom was large, and the beds were comfortable. The concierge that was working while we were there was not very knowledgeable about the surrounding area, restaurants, or attractions. You will learn more from reading the travel magazines in the room. For example, the concierge was not aware that many of the museums in Old San Juan are closed on Mondays and she thanked me for letting her know!

The beach here is kind of rough and not as pretty as some other places on the island. The hotel set us up on day trips to El Yunque and snorkelling. Both were excellent.

Recommend walking across the street to Starbucks or Camille's sidewalk cafe for quality light fair at a reasonable price. My wife and I enjoy walking through hotels and looking at their facilities.

The hotel is very nice and the location is nice. A turn-off was when on the beach seeing an abandonded builing on each side with grafatti. Otherwise nice. Il Verde which is about fifteen minutes away is a nicer beach but the city is not quite as nice as San Juan. Some Tips: Food Shopping: Go to Super Max about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel - best prices and large selection Taxi's - cost $15 plus $1 baggage each to and from airport. Very reliable and we had nice cab drivers each time...you can negotiate with them. They will take you most places on the island. Bus - Although cheap 75 cents each way, come and go sporatically as you can wait an hour or more. If you hit it right, you can pick up a bus with-in 10 minutes. Food - The hotel has great specials. Was not impressed with Tuscany. Dani's international has great pizza...the other items are okay but not impressive, it's about a 5 minute walk. Tiajuanna's, about a 5 minute walk has good mexican food but the resturant next to it was fabulous...great hanger steaks and salmon, also good peene pasta alfredo. Jam and Marmalade are very good but way overpriced as they do not give you much food but charge a premium for it...although the food is really good. The Cordado hotel and casino about a 10 minute walk has a great breakfast. The Radisson hotel and casino serves a reasonable and good lunch. Excursions - The rain forest is nothing special but nice for nature lovers. Alot of walking up and down hills/steps. The water fall is beautiful. We did a snorking trip which was rather impressive. The crew was really nice..lot's of drinks and food...a really beautiful place on the carribean side about an hour away by taxi. One of the most beautiful places you'll ever see! All the snorking companies go there..it's about 25 miles from St Thomas Old San Juan - Beautiful with lot's of shops and resturants. The forts are really nice and El Mirro is on really beautiful grounds with the ocean as a back drop. Old San Juan was very nice. A must visit! Bacardi Rum Tour - nice and genorus with free drinks but it will cost you more than the \"free\" they talk about. First you pay for a ferry to go there which is cheap. Then when there, you are solicited to take a taxi to the factory as it is about 20 minute driving distance away. you have no choice. That will cost you about $3 per person. Return trip is the same price so multiply it X2. Il Verde Beach - Worth a day trip there. Beautiful beach with some beach bars/resturants right on the beach. Some tables of jewely and crafts also on the beach and they have massage's available on the beach. Marriott Hotel Thursday Night - There's a band or DJ with good old american music..60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. Dollar drinks for the ladies includes wine, mixed drinks but not frozen drinks...A GREAT DEAL!

Activities: Loved the convenience of having hotel arrange outings for the family. they may not be the highest rated trips on Tripadvisor, but having it all arranged for us was perfect. The activities desk has a daily breakdown of trips. They organize it all including pick-up from and to hotel. Hubby & I did the day sail/snorkeling trip w/ my 16-yr old son and 6 yr old daughter. Make sure you apply sunscreen several times throughout that trip. My daughter tried snorkeling and just loved it. We brought our own lifejacket for her. My daughter and I did the horseback riding trip. It was not bad, but a long trip for a 6-year old. You ride around flat lands with some hills (all privately owned). There was lots of mud and we got real dirty! Definitely wear capris to protect thighs from sun, wear sneakers because of the mud. it's windy too, so if you have long hair, wear ponytail. Toured Morro fort in Old San Juan on our own - took a taxi $14. VERY windy as well, but well-worth the trip. Beautiful views, GREAT history. We walked through the city of Old San Juan. VERY narrow streets and it was hot! Stores are okay. building/architecture really cool. Food: Executive Lounge @ Hotel. We were able to take advantage of the Executive Lounge due to my husband's marriott status. perfect for me as I am an early-riser. Got coffee, a small danish or fresh fruit and read my book. They had juices, oatmeal, cereals, eggs, breads, danish. REALLY GOOD coffee! Hotel also has a in-house coffee shop, but it's expensive. Right across the street is a Starbucks. We also ate in-house at Tuscany. Ricardo took great care of us and was able to make a small plate of food for my young daughter. They didn't have a kids' menu, but catered well to her. Food & service was great. Concierge will provide you local restaurants with walking times. We ate at the mexican restuarant Tijuana's (loved it!), the italian restuarant next to it (loved it) and a small diner across the street from it for breakfast (quick, simple, cheap and good). We ate at Parrot Club in OSJ (meh. Really noisy, wrong order, really slow service). Also ate at Ceviche - GREAT mofongo, great service, amazing menu. My husband and I also had a date night - just the two of us and ate at Ruth's Chris. GREAT service - same food you would find in any Ruth's Chris. Hotel: We did not experience any issues w/ anything at the hotel. The 4th floor ocean-view rooms are right in front of the trees - I loved it for the privacy, but my husband wanted \"ocean view\". They accommodated our request the next day and we got the same room on 9th floor. Rooms were very spacious, I thought. We had two double beds, the fold-out couch, and the balconies are very roomy. Bathrooms also spacious. They are not generous on shampoo/conditioner, but they will bring extra if asked. Pools were great and fun for both my son and daughter. We spent more time at pool than in the ocean. Pool bar fun, too! Bartenders/servers were wonderful. Food at pool was not great, but did the job. Casino was very clean and they give \"lessons\" every day. Add'l comments: Puerto Rico is hot. the restaurants are cold. My daughter would be uncomfotably freezing half-way through dinner.

The location is great. You are a .75 cent bus ride from Old San Juan. The beach is nicely maintained, and the waves are big and fun. There are many good restaurants either direction on Ashford. Our favorites were Danny's for the breakfast sandwich on crusty french bread, and Angels for the Mofongo. As for the rooms: we started on the 7th floor in the Cabana tower.. It was great with a pool and ocean view. They seemed newer. The tv didn't work, so we asked for service. When they didn't respond after several days and requests, my partner went a bit ballistic. It could not be fixed, so, they moved us to a corner room on the 11th floor in the main tower. Fabulous view. Two balconys: one overlooking the ocean and the other onto the pool. The moral here: the real assertive and squeaky wheel gets the oil at this hotel. Other than that, the service was great. The employees are incredibly nice and accomodatiing. They truly go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. From the towel person, to the beach /chair umbrella guys, to the housekeeping staff. No complaints. Yes, there were locals on the weekends.at the pool. Probably graduation parties and proms. But it was no big deal and added to the flavor. FYI: you must try the Rumrunner! It was expensive but worh at least a round. Misc: the casino was a decent size, and they serve free drinks and food to the gamblers. Yes, it may take a little while to get your order (this is true of PR in general), but, hey it's free. So ask! The turkey and chicken sandwiches were good. The slots seemed tighter than in the states, though, my partner did hit a royal flush on a quarter poker machine for a thousand. The hotel restaurants are ok, nothing special. Though, both offer specials that are quite good deals. Ask for the \"special menu\". There is a Walgreens on Ashford and a dry cleaners a couple of blocks down Condado Avenue. You will find all that. There is grocery store within an eight minute walk. SuperMax. Easy to get to for those refrigerator and cooler items. Take a left out the hotel, go two blocks and take a right on Cervantes, walk until it dead ends and take a left on Wilson. It is about five block on your right. You will also pass a nice park to rest in on the way back! The only negative I can think of was the musty smell of the pillows. We asked for foam ones instead, but they smelled too.

Many of the positive reviews are fair and I read every review before I traveled to San Juan. Many of the reviews were very helpful so I decided to help other reviewers as well. If I would rate the this hotel I would give it a 7 out of 10. I stayed at the Marriott San Juan from June 22-27.The only issue I had with this hotel is that I booked a double and was placed in a King. I was told that they were fully booked and that was the only room that was available. I highly doubted that but sharing a King bed with my cousin wasn't a big deal and I wanted to enjoy my vacation without being irritated by staff who could care less, so I did not push the issue.The room that we were placed in was nice and comfortable so it wasn't that much of a deal.Unfortunately, two days later my friend checked in and received a double bed room when I was told they were booked for the duration of my stay.This hotel definitely lost points due to unprofessionalism and dishonesty. The front desk staff isn't the most friendliest and should definitely be given more training on customer service (continuing personal conversations as you're waiting to be helped and ignoring you until they're ready to acknowledge you. The rest of the hotel staff was amazing, from the bell workers to bartenders, and pool/beach assistants. I suggest you call to confirm you accommodations before arrival because I noticed that previous guests had this same issue with receiving rooms which accommodated them and their parties. On a brighter note that was the only issue and besides that we had an amazing time. The hotel room is nice but very small. The bathroom is small and only one person can squeeze in there at a time. We had a room on the 7th floor and booked a city view room but it was half city and half ocean, not bad! The view was very beautiful but we didn't spend much time on the balcony. The room was a little humid when we arrived but once we turned on the air conditioner, the smell left. The AC does turn off when you open the doors. The bed was comfortable and we didn't have any issues with our room. The hotel has two pools. One pool is one foot and the other adult pool is deeper. Unfortunately, people play volley ball in the pool so you can forget about having a nice swim or good time in the pool without worrying about getting hit by a ball. The same with the jacuzzi which is really small. The beach is nice but the water in really rough so if you're not a great swimmer, I would recommend not going to deep into the ocean because the waves will easily carry you away. There was plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas. We didn't have to wake up super early to fight the crowd to get a chair or umbrella. The hotel provided you with chairs/umbrella and just just provide your name and room number. Sometimes we arrived around 1pm and had no problem with getting any of those items. The hotel does have a bar and music entertainment area when you first walk in. We enjoyed it and spent a few nights listening to music and having drinks at the bar. The hotel does have a small casino with tables and slots. We gambled out of boredom but nothing special.If you're looking for a resort to just relax at the hotel all day I do not think that the Marriott San Juan is the place. If you're looking for a nice hotel to stay while you tour and visit Puerto Rico, this may be the place. We did not eat at the hotel because of previous reviewers stating that it was too expensive but there are plenty of food places surrounding the hotel. You can make a right or left and there are affordable restaurants. We went to Danny's a pizza place that is really good, Tijuana a Mexican restuarant that was good as well. A 24 hour place called Latin Star that was good too, and Orozco which was also good. The mojitos were really good at all the restaurants including the bar at the hotel. The customer service at some of the restaurants is not that great because the tip is already included on the bill, make sure you pay attention to that so you do not over pay.The customer service at Orozco and Tijuana was great! There is a Wendy's, Baskin Robins, Dunkin Donuts, and Chilli's to the right of the hotel( within 3-5 minutes of walking). There is a Walgreens right across the street with standard prices and its good for snacks and misc items that you may have forgotten to pack. I took some advice from a previous review and rented a car from Charlie's for a day(Rental car place right across from hotel). We drove to El Yunque Rainforest which was really beautiful. It took about 40 minutes from the hotel. The rental car cost about $50.00 including gas and insurance. Its cheaper than the tours because the hotel cost 57.00 per person. If you don't mind driving and want to save some money, I would recommend renting a car.You just have to be very careful because once you exit the expressway. The last highway is a small street which is easy to miss if you don't pay close attention to the upcoming turn. The paths in the rain forest are easy to follow and you can drive up to each destination you want to view if you do not want to do too much walking (that was one of the great things about having a car). You can stop at the visitor center to get information on the rain forest for 7.00 per person or you can just tour the rain forest on your own. We paid the 7.00 but it wasn't necessary.Definitely wear comfortable shoes such as tennis shoes and avoid sandals or flip flops. It can be slippery, especially if you want o climb up to the waterfall. We visited Old San Juan which was really beautiful as well. You can take the bus which is 0.75 cents (exact change or you can catch a taxi for $14.00). There was a couple waiting at the bus stop and we split the cab fare with them which cost us $7.00( it took about 10 minutes to get to Old San Juan. It takes about 20-25 minutes on the bus.The bus stop is a few minutes from the hotel across from Walgreens. The bus runs about every 30 mins. but does not run on an exact schedule so be patience if you choose to catch the bus. All in all, we had a great time in San Juan Puerto Rico. I would return to this hotel but would definitely inform management of any problems or concerns.

Getting to the hotel from the airport was easy, The flat rate for a taxi is $15 plus $1 for each suitcase. Upon arriving, we checked in immediately and early. I had booked an oceanfront room and requested a center room on a top floor. We were given a room on the 19th floor(The hotel has 21 floors). The view was beautiful. The room was decent. Nothing overly impressive, but not disappointing either. The furnishings were newer and the bathroom had nice finishes. The vent in the room did show some moisture stains around its frame. I will say that I would agree with other reviewers in saying that the rooms were humid. In the summer, I do prefer my hotel room to be cold with no humidity. So this did bother me some. The way the room thermostat works is that it only runs when you manually turn it on while you are in the room. If you open your balcony door or the door to the room, the air automatically shuts off due to sensors and resets to a default setting. So each time you go to the pool, beach, or to eat your room heats up and becomes muggy again. This little ritual did get a little old. The pools were nice. My daughter loved the water slide. The kids pool is very shallow, maybe 2 feet. The adult pool is maybe 4 feet. The adult pool could be bigger in my opinion. The swim up bar did not seem to be open during our stay although I did not attempt to obtain service there. There did seem to be an overabundant number of teenagers at the pool on Wednesday. I believe they were locals that either bought day passes(if that is even something that Marriott offers) or that split the cost of one room so they could swim. Either way it didn't really bother me at all. The wait staff at the pool and beach did give us outstanding service. The lounge chair and umbrella service at the beach was convenient and also very good. The ocean is a little rougher here, but we had a great time in the waves. We even bought a boogie board at the Walgreens which was just one block away from the hotel. My daughter met many great little kids to play with while at the beach and pool. She really did have a great time. The beach was fairly large and by no means overcrowded during our stay. We did eat at the hotel and the food was good and priced the way you should expect. There are many restaurant choices to the left and to the right of the hotel. We ate at Ummo, Via Appia, Danny's, and Tijuanas. All were good. The steaks at Ummo were especially good. We did rent a car for a day while in San Juan from Charlie Car Rental. This was by far the best place at only $30 for each 24 hours. We used the car to drive to Fajardo where we did the kayaking trip to El luguna Grande/BioBay, This was a very cool excursion. We used Enchanted Island Eco Tours and I highly recommend them. All in all, this was a nice trip and a nice change of pace. I would recommend the hotel based on my experience with great service and what I thought was a fair value.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cMerry Time at the Marriott\u201d", "Author": "KiKiG1234", "ReviewID": "UR68675233", "Content": "My hubby and I stayed at the Marriott San Juan Resort & Stellaris Casino mid June.

Extremely comfortable beds and bedding, but a little more attention should be placed on cleanliness of bed linens and towels. The beach front space was quite large and there were no crowds, the casino is huge and has quite a variety of penny slot machines. The lobby/ bar area really does turn into a small disco at night with a live band and dancing. It was very entertaining, we saw alot of people enjoying themselves. If it is not what you like then, there are alot of other areas that you can go to escape. The one area I think the Marriott needs to work on is the food. There are the 2 restaurants, but the menu just has little variety and they are a bit expensive. We ate there twice, the food was okay but it would have been better if you didn't have to leave the hotel to search for food choices. The cafe at the front of the hotel had some good breakfast choices, but still when you are on vacation, you don't want to think about searching for food. On exploring, we decided that the Marriott Stellaris was our best option in the Condado area, when you look at the other offerings available. Its setting on the beachfront together with its proximity to local restaurants, shopping and old san juan, cannot be beat.

We had an oceanfront room, so a really nice view. Room was clean, and free water replenished each day. Our only complaint was that the room did have a slight humid or mildewy smell. We did keep the door open a lot, so that probably didn't help the situation. But it really wasn't a big deal to us at all. The other thing to keep in mind is that service is slower there.

If you are serious about a vacation and staying on the property, look elsewhere. First impressions are everything. Upon walking in you are met by a room full of high top tables that are crammed into the space. Obviously they do not care that it looks like you are entering a big bus station with luggage piled high and tired weary people sitting around waiting for a room. At night they convert the space to a noisy bar. Even though we arrived at approximately 1:00pm, our room was not available until 4:30pm.

In one instance, they had folded a dirty towel (I know because make-up was on the towel) and put it in with the clean towels. A bright spot...we enjoyed the casino. However, if you want a quality place to drink and dance...go elsewhere. This place is just loud and a bit sleazy as it is something like drinking and dancing at a bus station.

The beach is nice, although you should suggest that the attendant situate your lounge chair and umbrella in a direction other than east so you don't have to look at the abandoned, graffiti-covered building two doors down. And bring fresh, strong sunscreen! The pool tends to get crowded and is not really suited for swimming. Drinks from the bar at the beach are expensive but no one seems to object to BYOB from the liquor store down the street. The Condado neighborhood provides a variety of dining and shopping options within walking distance. The bus to old San Juan leaves from a stop down the block, although the schedule is uncertain. There is a lot to see and do in old San Juan, but wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to duck in for a cool drink every couple of hours. Although food and drinks were generally expensive (Puerto Rico is an island, after all -- and subject to US taxes as well), food and drinks at the hotel were especially expensive. We generally avoided the hotel venues -- the casino is awful and the lobby bar is just a bunch of tables in a lobby with absolutely no ambiance -- in favor of restaurants and bars in Condado or old San Juan. Prices were a bit better and the local atmosphere was much more appealing. There were a few service glitches -- a lost fax, an unhelpful concierge, the door to our room left ajar -- that would be unacceptable in a city hotel. Maybe it was all the rum, maybe it was a sense of diminished expectations that came with being in what at times seemed like a third-world country, but it didn't seem to matter so much. We would come back, just because it's such an easy trip to the tropics.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corner Brook, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel but overpriced.\u201d", "Author": "Mappie", "ReviewID": "UR63960390", "Content": "We booked an oceanfront room with patio.

My 4-year-old loved the huge kiddie pool. It's definitely a family friendly hotel. The cons: My husband and I booked one of the 2 vice presidential suites on the penthouse level as a way of splurging a bit before the arrival of our second baby. In fact, the only reason why we chose this hotel over the Hilton or El San Juan was because they had such a nice suite available. The others were booked. When we got to the check-in desk, we were told by the not-very-helpful front-desk employee that our reservation was for a standard room not the VP suite. I showed her the confirmation email. She still insisted that the reservation wasn't for the suite. The manager comes up and explains that there was some sort of mix-up and they double-booked the VP suite so we were simply out of luck because they just gave the suite away earlier that day. They gave us $100 off the standard room as a way to make up for it, but that wasn't the point. We wanted the bigger suite that we booked months in advance. Had I known this would happen, I would've chosen El San Juan, which we visited while we were there and is a MUCH more beautiful hotel with much more to do. Another con to the hotel is the lack of waters ports at the beach. My husband and I love jet skiing, parasailing, and all the other water sports.

The rooms were spacious, clean, and nicely equipped. Hotel staff was always extremely friendly. Casino staff was nice and jovial. No problems getting drinks while gambling; waitstaff was always coming by to check if we needed anything. This seems like a no-brainer but at many of the casinos in Vegas, wait staff can be hard to find at the low-money slots. No problem here! Good bands in the bar made it a great night for dancing.

We proceeded to tell her there was no way we were going to be able to stay in a regular room for 10 days....she went on to say there was nothing she could do, that the hotel was overbooked and basically we had to take it or leave it. ( we had just flown over night from LA to New York to PR there was no where we could go. We even asked if we could just have 2 regular rooms.

Room numbers ending in 01-03 (i.e. 1201-1203) and 23-25 (i.e. 1223 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1225) face south looking towards the city (its called a city view in the reservation). They have balconies so you can step out and see the harbor with the cruise ships. Rooms ending in 04-10 (i.e. 1204 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1210) face west and have a mixed view of the city, the harbor, the pool area, and the ocean. This is my favorite. However, there is one downside, is the evening sun is really bright coming into the rooms. If you are looking at a computer monitor, it can make it more difficult to see due to the glare. Since I am here for work, I do have to adjust my view. Rooms ending in 11-16 (i.e. 1211 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1216) face north have a view of the ocean. I have stayed on this side and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice view of the ocean the beach. Rooms ending in 17-22 (ie. 1217 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1222) face east have a partial view of the beach, the ocean and a city view. You are primarily looking east towards Isla Verde. I have never stayed on this side. In the other building, known as the Cabanas, the room numbers go from 31 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 45 (i.e. 231- 245) and have floors 2-9. All the rooms face north and look out over the pool area and then on to the beach and the ocean. I have stayed here and the rooms are very nice as well. The rooms ending in 31 are the handicapped rooms. The bathroom sinks are smaller than the other rooms. If you use a lot of bathroom products, you might want to avoid the rooms ending in 31. There are washing machines and dryers available on the ground floor in the Cabana building. If you need change, the check in desk will provide you with change for the W&D. THE POOLS AND BEACH: The pool area is very nice with three pools and a hot tub. It also has a swim up bar. The service in the pool area is spotty. Sometimes its quick and other times you wonder if anyone showed up for work. The beach, is well, the beach. The beach attendants will pull your chaise lounges out for you. If you want to order a drink, its really better if you go to the bar near the beach entrance and get it. INTERNET ACCESS: All over the hotel, the wireless signal is weak. Iin your room you have to have your laptop by the patio door and have the door open to be able to get a good signal. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned to adjust, but they could improve this service. When signing on, you have to select the fee plan of one day or the three day. Select the three day. You will not pay for the amount shown anyway. The wireless service is actually paid for through the resort fee that is charged. My resort fee was $23.40. But, you have to accept the fee in order to get access to the internet. TIME TO EAT: As a Marriott Elite member, I have access to the concierge lounge, so I do not have to pay for breakfast during the week. On the weekends. I usually eat the breakfast buffet. Its $21.95 ( a little pricey, but hey you are in a resort area) and I add enough tip to bring it to $25.00. There are some nearby restaurants that are cheaper. Camilles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s which is directly across Ashford Avenue from the hotel is a fine example. THE CASINO: The Casino is small. It has the table games and slots. All the casinos on the island are small and attached to a hotel. Of all the major hotel chains, only the Caribe Hilton does not have a Casino. OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES: There are outside activities offered as well. The hotel has a very good tour desk with which you can book your tours. My wife and son came down for a couple of weeks and we hit the snorkle trip and a kayaking trip. We had several other walking trips we took as well. The trips will pick you up at the hotel and bring you back. SECURITY: Security is not an issue. in or outside the hotel. The tourist area of Condado is heavily patrolled by the police all along Ashford. Go in groups if possible and stay in the tourist area. On weekends, there is a band in the lobby bar area. They are very loud, so if loud bands bother you, stay away from the lobby bar. If you check in during this period, you will have a hard time hearing the desk clerks. GETTING TO THE OLD CITY: The San Juan city bus service is really slow and not reliable. The buses should come along once an hour, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a sure bet. The drivers are all public employees and give the attitude that they really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if you ride the bus or not. I have ridden the bus and it was fine, just the surly attitude of the drivers. If you choose to ride, its 75 cents one way, exact change only! There is a stop on Ashford Ave, just to the right of the hotel. OR TAKE A WALK INSTEAD: Its about a 3 \u00c2\u00bd mile walk to the old City. Just head west along Ashford and keep the beach on your right. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice walk and I recommend everyone take it at least once. Do take a bottle of water with you. You can take a taxi or the bus back (Route A43 or B21). There is a 24 hours Walgreens Pharmacy a block away. If you need a medicine refill or some snack items, the Walgreens will have it. And yes, they do sell sunscreen.

Well, I quickly discovered that my teenage son did not bring ANY long pants, and we were going to Easter service the next day! No problem, a wonderful manager named Arturo found a pair of pants that employees from the hotel use in my son's size! He wore them to dinner and to church the next day. Who displays such kindness?! When my son got a migraine the last day of our trip, our maid Maria tried her best to understand English and gave me several extra bottles of water, towels, shampoo, and even a bottle of rubbing alcohol. She came round the next morning to see how he was feeling. Once while swimming in the ocean, my daughter got a small jelly fish sting and two security guards filled out a report and gave us lotion to use - a suggestion was made to use vinegar on it and the hotel's outdoor cafe gave us some vinegar quickly. It worked. I would also like to thank Maika, the front office asst. mgr., for the excellent restaurant suggestions. We went to two outstanding places - Da Luigi (Homemade pasta) and Fleria (Best Greek food I've tasted yet.) These small, non tourist- trap restaurants were just what we were looking for.

The room was very nice (typical hotel room) and clean. The view was great (ocean/pool view). The pools were a bit crowded but not that bad.

We decided it was worth it because it was an ocean front corner room with a double balcony. (We had booked a city view standard room.) It was worth the price for waking up and going to sleep with the sounds of surf in the room and the view was fantastic. Overall, a very clean, well maintained property. The beach is beautiful for swimming, walking and sunning. Chaise lounges and umbrellas set up for you and bar/food service on the beach - what more do you need? I will say the food leaves a lot to be desired but plenty of choices within walking distance for dinner etc. A neighborhood Walgreens on the corner was great for forgotten flip flops, another paperback novel and snacks for the room. Ask for Pedro around the pool or beach - he was our #1 pick for waiter, made sure our drinks were poured well and took care of us. He even hugged me and thanked me the day we left.

This time (March 25-29) was even better. The main restaurant's (the Vista's) food has been vastly improved: used to be o.k., now it's really good, with Puerto Rican options, if you want a flavor of the island; or really good standards, like steak, pasta, etc. It's ambiance and food remind me a lot of a good cruise ship's, including its extensive buffet options at most meals. Tuscany restaurant is also great. Staff are very friendly and helpful, and they all speak English, which eases things. We always get upgraded just by asking nicely. I do understand the frustrations about the air conditioning breakdown, but that's been fixed. Also, I've noticed that a lot of complaints here seem to have more to do with overblown expectations and cultural miscommunications than with the hotel itself. This is a very nice hotel, but it's not the Four Seasons. Because this place is big, there is sometimes some disorganization, particularly with digital things (video folios and checkout, wireless access, Internet reservations, etc.), and I recommend that the hotel do a bit of training of their employees on those things, but if you're on vacation, that shouldn't be a big issue. And it's Latin America, not NY. Puerto Ricans are rather laid back and friendly, but they do not respond well to hypertensive, hollering Americans (being a New Yorker, I'm sometimes guilty of this, too). We have found a smile and a joke go much further than a grouchy remark to get help. I really recommend this place, and we'll certainly go back.

I will definitely be staying again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially after seeing some of the other hotels in the area, this is definitely one of the best (the other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd being La Concha, which is more expensive). The good: - Location is excellent! You walk out of the hotel and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at the beach. They have chairs and umbrellas that they set up for you and people walk around and take your drink and food order. - The bed was so comfortable! I have a hard time sleeping and I slept like a baby in this bed with no tossing and turning. My boyfriend admitted to having to check my breathing to make sure I was still alive because I wasn't moving. - The pool area is very nice. They have the shallow pool mainly for kids then the main area that has the slide and swim up bar (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 26 and my b/f and I both had a lot of fun going down the slide so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just for kids). The area with the swim up bar was shallow, but got deeper (to about 5 feet) toward the slide area. - Staff is extremely friendly. I did not encounter one rude person, room service was fast, and they were all very willing to answer questions and help as needed. - Drinks are decently priced (according to NYC standards) and the pool bars have happy hour from, I believe, 2 - 7 with 2 for 1 on Bacardi/juice drinks so each drink would be about $4. - You can check your bags if you arrive early or have some time after check out before your flight leaves so you can go out and enjoy the pool and beach without dragging your luggage around. - The casino was nice for a hotel casino, definitely not like Vegas. They keep you filled with free drinks. - Weekend entertainment is nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they have live music in the lobby with a lot of people dancing and drinking. It was a lot of fun. - You can walk on the beach at night. They block it off at the hotel, but if you walk off the resort and walk down Condado st (right next to the hotel), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open so you can get on the beach. - There seemed to be a lot of activities for kids. - Balcony at each room is very nice with 2 chairs and a table -- ours was big in the main tower with a city view room, others were a bit smaller. We had a city view room which was nice at night, not so nice in the day. Ask for a pool view room in the cabana building and you will get a nice view of the pool AND ocean without having to pay the oceanfront price. The bad: - We waited about 20 minutes in line then another hour for the room because it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready (we arrived at 1pm and were in the room by 2:15pm, still 45 minutes before the actual check-in time). They did pass out free drinks (non-alcoholic) while we were waiting, though. - They put a $200 hold for incidentals at check-in. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using your debit/check card (versus credit card), they charge $200 and refund it at the end OR you can withdraw $200 cash and get that back in cash at the end. That was a little annoying. - Food is very expensive, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rely on it for all meals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but keep in mind you ARE at a resort. The food selection at the pool bar, beach, and room service is limited, but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a quick snack, you could split the $9 quesadilla or $13 chicken sandwich to get you through until you make it to one of the restaurants on Ashford Ave. OR just wait for the woman who walks up and down the beach selling absolutely delicious empanada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for $4 (not affiliated with the hotel). - The water is a little rough, but this IS located on the ocean and not the sea (which is calmer than the ocean). The surf died down around 2:30pm so you could actually swim in between waves. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the beach and your back is to the hotel, walk to the right and there is a little lagoon area blocked off by rocks that has water that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 2 feet deep.

Plan on spending $50 - $80++ for two people for dinner in this area. Most places are allacart on Ashford st area. Taxi fairs are about $15 plus bags to airport each way. $17 to go to Old San Juan. They gave us poor information on the Bacardi tour. The ferry is $100 r/t but once you get to the island, the taxi fairs are extra and you don't know what the final price will be. I gave this feedback to the concierge' office. Hopefully they will pass this on. There is a few few spots for breakfast near by for about $8.00 for a basic breakfast. Lunch at the pool is around $15 and drinks can be $10, beer $5.50 for a draft. We found a stop & Go that had beer for $7.50 a six pack. CVS was cheaper. They do provide a good beach service for free- tip the attendants tho.

The building next door is a ultra-expensive condo; therefore there is not a ugly building next to the hotel. I think that the building that some may have talked about could have been the maintance building which can be seen from one side of the hotel. The Condado beach area is a hip trendy area. Food at the hotel has the good days and bad. The area restaurants have service and selection. The taste at each restaurant is special and 5 star. Expensive as in NYC, Chicago, San Francisco. We are foodies and this is some of the best we have tasted. There is site seeing and do-nothing vacation in San Juan. This is your choice. The Spa is outstanding.

The San Juan Marriott in Condado has faded a bit and falters here and there making you feel bad it's losing its stuff. When the things that stand out about a resort is the security and the fitness center, then it means that other resorts in the brand or competitive brands have raised the bar. Here are some random observations: - We had reserved a tower room well in advance. At check in, we were switched to a non tower room. Since front desk personnel at Marriott's have always up front with us, we did not confirm our room type at check in till we go to the room. If we would have gotten an explanation and apology for this, we would have been ok with but it was worse the change was not disclosed to us in a professional manner. While room type in some situatons can't be guaranteed, we found in this case there was no disclaimer for our reservation. - The room looked pretty good for an older hotel and appeared but was showing its wear even though attempts have been made to keep it somewhat updated. The bed was confortable and plumbing worked great. However, there was a moldy smell in the room So yeah, some room might not smell but others do.The couch was broken. - the pool area can be rather cramped when full and at any given time. Around 1/3 of the chairs at any given time seem to be in the shade. Not much can be done on this given the limited space they have available but with other resorts being more spacious and comfortable, it makes this place seem lower in quality - The public areas of this hotel are nothing special...Nothing memorable about them...other than the entire lobby is consumed by a giant bar. - The security from what we could tell was excellent... Hanging out in the lobby, at entrances, by the pool - darm good fitness center with a good number of treadmills and other cardio equipment. Rack and freeweights and at least 13 various weight machines We did encounter some good service-oriented employees at this resort but in other cases, we did not.

Two drinks will easily cost $20, which adds up extremely fast. We ate dinner there twice, and for 2 of us it cost $60 the first night and $130 at Tuscany's. The food wasn't worth that much. I would recommend leaving the hotel and walking east 1 block where you will find many restaurants serving better food at a cheaper price.

We spent one day seeing the sights in OSJ and we were satisfied. If you have time for only one of the forts, choose San Cristobal. Do not drive in the city of OSJ unless you can drive in Rome. On the other hand, the buses do not run on schedule. Plan an hour each way if you want to save money with the .75 cent bus fare -- exact change requried. We rented a car from Charlie's right across the street to go to the El Yunque rainforest. It cost $37 for the day and the drive was not difficult. Just watch your back as tailgating seems like a pasttime. Even if you are over 60, you can walk up to La Mina Falls if you have good walking shoes. I would have worn hiking boots had I known the trail was so slick. Don't forget to bring water. This is the best rainforest we have ever experienced in North America. It's a walk we'll always remember. There is some truth to all of the comments on this website, but overall we loved hearing the sound of the surf from our oceanside room. My husband and I don't swim so we enjoyed just watching the surfers and the skill of those trying to swim in the high waves. Unfortunately, the beach is not for walking because of the scum from the surf and the dilapedated buildings on the beachfront --- ugh! We only ate breakfasts at the hotel and they were good. The best meal we had was at Miro's across the street from the hotel, but it was also the most expensive. One night we had the best Margheritas ever at Tiajuana's, but the next night when we ate there, the Margherita was poor and the food mediocre compared to Mexican restuarants in Chicago. My husband liked his meal at YerbaBuena but I thought the chicken was very dry. If you eat at Ummo's, the chicken and skirt steak are very, very good, but avoid the \"dinner for two\" items on the menu unless you like sweetbreads (calf neck) and fatty short ribs. We thought the service at the hotel was great! Ask for Mica if you have problems. She is the \"It\" girl there. We didn't find our room humid, but our clothes felt and smelled more damp than usual when we unpacked and everything needed to be washed. The Fitness Center is not to be missed. The equipment is the best we've ever seen at any hotel. Our main disappointment was the lack of live music in walking distance from the hotel. The music in the hotel lobby was so loud we couldn't hear each other talk. Even the Renaissance had no live music during the week, although that very beautiful hotel seemed sterile compared to the Marriott. We did not find any night life in walking distance except for the gambling at La Concha where we had better luck than at the Marriott casino. We were very lucky with the weather and never before experienced what we considered \"perfect\" weather. No rain, no wind, no bugs, and no humidity. We ate outside each night and felt like we were in a comfortable inside room. The last day it poured and seeing the palm trees sway in the wind was probably more realistic.

Good buffet breakfast ( including tax and tip 48 for two people) 4. Nice lobby bar and casino available albeit very small by US standards 5.

Tour recommended in the lobby was really a delivery boy who pretty much told us how much time we had to before getting back to bus during three stops 6. Pools were pretty much totally covered with shade due to too many trees 7. Had to negotiate the big shadow created by the hotel 8. Pretty much all the hotels in Candado have below average beaches 9. Ok note taxi was always 15 dollars plus tip everytime we used it and while the bus was quick when it got there was on no particular schedule We took a taxi to Isla Verde and bus back and stayed on the beach at the Courtyard Marriot. It had an excellent beach, very good beach amenities, a more spacious sun coverd pool and no feeling of being overly crowded. Inside we walked in and it felt more like a Hampton Inn. Thus, the balance between the more luxurious Marriot Lobby ( and maybe rooms) vs a far superior beach and outside area at the Courtyard Marriot...btw..the planes overhead there did not seem very significant. Overall, a fun vacation due to the time in Old San Juan, a brief walk to Plaza de Mercado near the marriott, 3/5 sunny days away from snow in the US, and a solid time at the Marriott.

Great location for the 10 minute ride to Old San Juan or east to Isla Verde area. Also, walking distance to some good, varied restaurants.

One of the nice points of emphasis at hotel (also seems to be characteristic of other hotels) is the central lobby location for the hotel bar, with live music on several nights of our stay.

Our room was on the small side for four people but it was very comfortable with a nice bathroom and a big lanai with a view of the ocean (even though they told us it was a city view room). The beach area is a bit small and a significant part is shaded during the day, but fine for hanging out. (I had a massage at the place on the beach; view of ocean was pleasant but massage rather mediocre.) Pool area was very nice and in the evening when you walked through the area you could hear the unique chirping of the coqui frogs. Neighborhood was ok too - never felt like we were in any danger. My husband and 10-year-old son went on one of the half day tours to El Yunque rain forest and really enjoyed it, particularly the guide, whom my son bonded with and followed around. We didn't take the bus to Old San Juan; cabs seem to be zoned in the city and I think the ride from Condado to Old SJ is supposed to be $12 but we were charged anywhere from $12-15.

It's a shame to give this place 2 stars instead of 5, but the stench of mildew in our damp room(s) was a huge detractor from the friendly service, great location, and otherwise fabulous rooms. If mold/mildew does not bother you or cause you respiratory problems, then definitely stay here. Otherwise, keep looking! Long version: We were given a room on the Cabana side, 7th floor. We noticed the smell immediately and called the front desk. They said there were no other rooms and sent up a kid from housekeeping with a spray bottle of greenish liquid that he said was \"to cover the smell.\" Since the problem was in the air, we did not know where he was supposed to spray, and neither did he. Called down again and suddenly there were other rooms available. A super-nice guy from housekeeping showed us two more rooms. One was two floors below us and had a strong chemical smell. Guy said it was from the freshly cleaned carpets and the smell would dissipate. He was right-- the \"carpet cleaner\" smell went away in a few hours and was replaced with the same musty, moldy stench. We were placed on a waiting list for a dehumidifier (the hotel has several, and they were all being used by other guests-- red flag!). After a damp, sleepless night we called down again and got the same story. After a day on the beach there was still no dehumidifier. More calls downstairs did not help. Only after we went to the front desk and acted like a couple of jerks did they \"find\" us a dehumidifier. The machine ran non-stop, filling with water every few hours. The smell got better, but never went away. By the 4th day it had invaded our clothes, too. Marriott needs to do something about the air quality in this hotel before someone gets really sick. As mentioned, the rooms were otherwise great-- nice furniture, fabulous bed/bedding, new flat-screen TV, spacious bathroom (no fan, though). Cabana rooms are definitely bigger than those in the main tower. Everything was clean and housekeeping kept it that way throughout our stay. Everyone on the staff was extremely polite and friendly, even when we were complaining. The beach is good by San Juan standards, and there are plenty of chairs/umbrellas. Drinks/food are at typical resort prices, with acceptable quality. As you walk out of the hotel, there's a liquor store to the left and a Walgreen's to the right, both nearby. You can stock up on drinks/snacks and keep them in your room fridge. Tips: The blackjack tables in the casino are \"no peek.\" So, if the dealer is showing an ace or face card, you should think twice before splitting or doubling down-- the dealer could end up with blackjack and you'll lose more than your original bet. Also, shop around before booking a tour with the hotel. They put us on a rainforest excursion that was basically just a $53 bus ride with a lazy guy who didn't know much about the rainforest.

I didn't get to use the high speed internet connection, but the in-room coffee service was great - we made coffee in the morning and sat on our balcony and just sat enjoyed the view. There are many other amenities, including free hour of internet each day of your stay. There is a kiosk where you can print your boarding pass without going to the business/computer center, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working when I tried to use it, so Guest Services printed them for me and send it up to our room. Service was generally excellent. Our bell boy, Pedro, waited patiently for us to check in, then gave us lots of advises on where to eat, what to see, best way to get around, and so forth. The front desk/guest services were equally accommodating. The woman behind the Concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desk seemed impatient and was annoyed with my questions because she was doing something else. Instead of nice sitting areas, the lobby has a bar right in the center and tables and chairs all around it. My husband said that is how most hotels are set up here. There is a Coffee Merchant that sells coffee, light snacks and ice cream during the day, then the place is turned into Noodle Village at night. We didn't try the Tuscany, which got great review from another travel site, but mixed review from TripAdvisor users. One of the couple we met told us the food was great though; they were from D.C. area so they should know We had breakfast at La Vista every day, and we always get the buffet breakfast, which, at $19.99pp, was the best value. You get made to order eggs/omelets (they do have eggbeaters), assorted fruits, cereals and pastries. We're so full from breakfast we seldom need to stop for lunch. They also have a seafood/prime rib dinner buffet, which we tried the last night we were in Puerto Rico, and it was also very good. There is a bus stop a block from the hotel, bus fare is .75pp. As is in the states, exact change is needed for the bus. Old San Juan is the last stop on most of the buses, but B-21 is the most direct route. From Old San Juan you can catch buses to various parts of the island. If you want to go to Isle Verde from the hotel you may be better off with a cab The hotel has two beautiful pool area, one only a few feet deep (for the families with little kids) and one that goes up to 5 feet deep. As hotel guests, you can get free umbrellas and chairs at the beach right in front of the hotel, and there are staff to help you set them up if you wish. I have read, and the hotel staff confirmed, that due to strong current, it is not a good idea to actually swim there. Most of the guests seem to heed these advises, and stay on the beach. The casino is small compare with those in the states, and the odds of winning are horrible, but I think that is the case for most of the casinos on the island. We visited hotels in Isle Verde, and while there are many nice hotels, including the famous El San Juan, with ornate lobby and great nightlife. But the neighborhood was not as well lit, and has fewer nice restaurants than Condado (thought I think the best restaurants are in Old San Juan) We also visited El Convento hotel. El Convento is quaint, but if you like all the modern convenience, such as a pool and fitness center, it may not be for you. It is located in Old San Juan, which is dark and very quite in some areas so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel as safe there. Overall, we were very happy with the choice we made, and would recommend this hotel to all our friends.", "Date": "December 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "yellow50", "ReviewID": "UR51075670", "Content": "This was a trip planned by my husband for my birthday.

The check in process was simple, but you have to talk loud as there is a band playing in the background. We got into our room and had a beautiful view of the city. Pool/Ocean: Definitely plan on spending at least 2 days at the pool/beach. They are absolutely beautiful. The poolside bar is a must to try and the drinks at very good, but expensive. Plan on spending at least $9 on 1 drink. The beach is nice and getting chairs is definitely a plus. If you want to get an umbrella, its $12 (I think) for one. Its very windy on the beach and the waves are pretty rough, but its still fun to swim in the ocean, just be careful. They do have waitstaff on the beach to get you drinks if you want them. Room: Beds are extremely comfortable to sleep in. Balcony is nice with table and chairs to enjoy some pre-dinner cocktails. Having a mini fridge in the room came in handy as we were able to keep milk for cereal in the mornings and sandwich meat for lunches. Digital temperate control in the room is convenient. The room heats up quickly if you leave the patio door open for a prolonged period of time. Facing the city was loud, but the patio doors surprisingly blocked out most of the noise. The walls between the rooms are thinner as we were woken up in the morning by a couple yelling at each other. We definitely enjoyed the time we spent in the room. Atttractions/Restaurants: We spent a day in Old San Juan and LOVED it. El Morro and San Cristobal are worth the $5/person admission. Very beautiful sites and even more beautiful views. Its about 1 mile walk between the two sites, but there is so much to look it at that it goes quick. You cant go wrong with any local restaurant for lunch. Taxis are easy to get too. We were planning on taking the bus for $.75 there, but as we were waiting, a taxi came up and said he would take us to OSJ for $3, so we took advantage of that. Otherwise, it costs $15 one way from the hotel to OSJ. We did the El Yunque rainforest tour ($53/person through the hotel) and we really enjoyed that as well. Shuttle picks you up at 8:30 in the morning and after an informative 50 minute drive you are there. Bring a poncho or umbrella as it rains on and off there. Beautiful sites and landscape. We would recommend this to anyone. The driver stopped off for lunch at a local stop on the side of a road from El Yunque and the food was DELICIOUS! We also ate dinners at Yerba Buena (very good, we recommend the duck, but expensive), Via Appai (slightly above average pizza, poor service), and Wasabi (good sushi, slow service). These restaurants are to the left of the hotel. Starbucks and Haggen-Dazs is right across the street and Walgreens (with groceries) is about 1 block from the hotel. You can purchase liquor about 4-5 blocks away at H&G (just past the Renaissance Hotel). Overall, we loved our 1st trip to San Juan. We will definitely stay at this hotel as everyone is very nice and helpful. It was very clean and you feel safe in the hotel as security is always around.

The hotel has two restaurants; the Tuscany and La Vista. The La Vista, while open for breakfast every day, was only open for buffet dinners on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, even though the Marriott web site implies open for dinner daily. That's not a problem since there are many restaurants with different cuisines within a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Another good feature is that Hertz has a car rental facility within the hotel with on-site pick up and drop off. There are plenty of discount deals for the hotel, but make sure the front desk gives you all the benefits you're entitled to. With so many guest packages, they tend to forget some of the perks.

The hotel is beautifu! The beach is just steps out the back door. The ocean on that side of the island is a little rough but not bad. The beach has chairs and umbrellas all you have to do is walk onto the beach and their is a person to help you, no fee for the chairs. The beach was a little dirty with some trash but people just need to clean up after they finish a drink or food. The food in the hotel was great the breakfast buffet was a little $$ but worth it. The service was great very helpful friendly people. We played tennis and the courts were in good condition. The pools are nice as well. The lobby at night is loud but it is a casino and big bar, I don't understand how people said they could hear the noise because after you turned the corner to go up to the room we could not hear anything....so it was not loud in the rooms. Security is not overwhelming but it does make you feel more comfortable. The area is very nice, the only bad thing was about 1/2 block down the beach was an old building looks as if a storm came through and they just did not fix it back up, NOT a big deal. Starbucks is right across the street and if you take a right as you leave the hotel there is a CVS or RiteAid (can't remember which) but we stocked up on food and water. MY ONLY complaint was the water pressure in the shower. It was like bathing in a sprinkler on low. I did not say anything because again it was NOT that big of a deal I have long hair it just too a little longer to shower, no problem. The room was big lots of room. Must get a balcony was beautiful in the moring, spend the money it will be worth. I will be staying next time we go and it is couple and kid friendly. GREAT PLACE!!!!!! Second ---IMPORTANT ---information!!! DO NOT DRIVE WHILE IN PR. The people can not drive. We rented a car and I have never had my \"life flash\" before me so many time. People cut you off, people can not park, people walk right out in the middle of the road...please take a cab. Also we could not park in old town.

We're in our mid-thirties, and have been to Grand Cayman, Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Tulum, Nuevo Vallarta, Belize, Cancun, Florida etc.....so we have something to compare this vacation to. TAXIS It's easy to find a taxi upon arrival to PR. It's not like Mexico where you arrive and people try to trick you into listening to a timeshare in exchange for a trip. It was $17 for 2 passengers w/2 bags. If you intend to travel around the area, plan to spend quite a bit in taxis, or you can take the bus. We ended up spending about $250 in taxis. It adds up quickly. The roads are crazy and people do not drive like they do in the US, so I personally wouldn't risk renting a car. If you are brave, feel free to do so. The HOTEL LOBBY is nice, and there is a bar area and casino upon entry. Not as flashy as some places we've been, but it was nice. Drinks at the bar were very good, some were a bit strong for my taste, but they are expensive. An ATM is on-site, as well as a small GIFT SHOP with t-shirts, drinks, candy, and any essentials you may have forgotten. The EMPLOYEES at the Marriott are there to serve you and do an exceptional job. This is the reason I would recommend this hotel. If you plan to stay in the Condado area, there are several restaurants and some shopping within walking distance, and we always felt very safe. WEATHER This was part of the disappointment of our trip because it rained 2 days of our 5 day trip. When the weather did cooperate, it was absolutely beautiful and in the mid-80's. ATTIRE The Puerto Rican women dress to the nines. If you go out somewhere special, you might want to bring a nice dress or outfit. Otherwise, shirts and shorts seemed to be accepted anywhere. It's not like Florida where people walk around in bikinis all day long. AROUND THE AREA WalGreens is to your right just about a block down the road. Straight ahead out of the hotel is a sandwich shop, and it's very good with reasonable prices. They had sandwiches, pasta, pizza, wraps, etc... It had two names, one being Taco Maker. We tried to go to Tijuana's because it was recommended on Tripadvisor, but they were closed on Sunday. We ate at the place next door, Via Appia's. They offered sandwiches, pasta and pizza. Food was decent, nothing extraordinary. We also tried a Puerto Rican restaurant just before Chili's, and it started with an A, but I cannot recall the specific name. It was good, something different. They offered meals or a buffet. FITNESS CENTER The fitness area at the hotel is very nice, and we found it to be used by many visitors, unlike any other place we have been. They have treadmills, ellipiticals, bikes and stair climber, along with various weight machines. They also offer a personal trainer if you desire. SPA Various facials, massages are offer. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the time slot I needed and you do need to make a reservation for a massage or other service. MASSAGE ON THE BEACH There is a man outside the hotel that offers massages on the beach. He initially wanted $175. We finally agreed on $75, but that was only for about 15-20 minutes. Honestly, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND HIM. Wait until you can get an appointment with someone at the hotel. I was experiencing horrible neck pain, and needed some relief, and that's the only reason I went. He seems to think he's a doctor and he tried cracking my neck and my back even though I tried resisting him. He then diagnosed me with a pinched nerve. I've been in more pain since I left. DON'T GO. I thought it would be relaxing by the ocean, but I was too tense from worrying he was going to hurt me. BEDS The beds are phenomenal. It was the best sleep I've had, so that was definitely nice. The pillows are incredibly plush and soft. HOTEL RESTAURANTS/FOOD We ate at La Vista and Tuscany in the hotel, and also grabbed coffee and a bagle at the little cafe each morning. Everything we had was well prepared and very tasty. Tuscany can be a bit slow at times, but we were on vacation, so we weren't in a rush. Prices were somewhat high, but not like in the Caymans. ROOMS We had an oceanfront room, and it was nicely appointed with an in-room safe and a mini refrigerator. They provide shampoo, lotion, gel, soap, iron and hair dryer. We felt the room was a bit small, but we normally have a room with a separate living/bed area. It was fine, I just expected it to be a bit larger. The view was spectacular. Spend the extra money to sit out on the patio and listen to the waves crashing. I would suggest keeping the door to the patio closed because the rooms can become extremely muggy. We spoke to other people who noticed the same thing. I do wish there were a fan in the bathroom because when the showers steam up the room, it's hard to keep from getting to hot even with the AC on. Sometimes the walls did seem a bit thin. The carpet also appeared somewhat worn, but the bathrooms were very nice, as was the bedding. ENTERTAINMENT They had entertainment most nights, consisting of very LOUD bands. The music was nice, but it was so loud we simply couldn't enjoy it. We're not old by any means, and even spoke to another couple who were 10 yrs younger, and they said they couldn't stand it that loud either. People must have liked it because many were dancing and enjoying themselves. In all, the people in PR are extremely friendly, and we had an enjoyable trip. The staff at the Marriott were eager to please and always very helpful. Anytime a taxi was needed, they were eager to serve or assist if you needed directions to find something. POOL This was our biggest complaint about the hotel. There are so many trees surrounding the area, it's nearly impossible to find a spot with sun. Some people may prefer that, and if so, this is the place for you. BEACH This is a great, beautiful, beach area. Likely one of the best in the area because it's so wide. They offer beach chairs and towels. OLD SAN JUAN This was the highlight of our trip. We truly enjoyed walking the streets of Old San Juan. It is so quaint and beautiful. Do not miss the Fort San Cristobal. It is a spectacular site and to see the history and enjoy the surroundings and beautiful views was breathtaking. Hope you find this helpful.

The lobby is what you'd expect at a business hotel except on nights when the band is playing, a conversation with the desk staff was completely impossible and we could hear the band through the floor in our 4th floor room so be advised if they try to put you in the front of the hotel on the 3rd, 4th or maybe the 5th floor ask for another room. The Condado area is pretty congested so the foot print of the hotel is small and pool area is limited and shady, the beach is nice but remember this is the Atlantic side of the island and the surf can be rough. There is a resort fee that you can't escape and if you're not going to be using their beach chairs and umbrellas you might want to choose another hotel as a base. Parking in San Juan is a big issue and you have to pay to park everywhere including here for $16 a day. As with all hotels and casinos that rate their customers if you're not a gold level member it's \"wait on that line with the other peons\" while others walk past you if you check in at peak times. I saw some comments on other reviews about empty buildings in the area and it is true that there are some empty hulks in view but in general the area is growing with several buildings under renovation.

It was just beautiful!!! I will always remember walking into the back lobby and getting that spectacular view of the pool and ocean.!!! We had a short wait for our room after checking in. and when we did get into our room we found that they upgraded us to a ocean front room.

It was rough, red flag was always up, but not too bad. The pool so relaxing, both when you were in it or just sitting around it. Lots of fun! Food prices were exensive at the hotel, but there are alot of restaurants within walking distance, so you had your choice. The drinks were good, we got to enjoy them at the beach and pool, The hotel was very clean, always a concern of mine, I did worry about that before we went, but all that worry was for nothing. Room was spotless! Althought we had no luck at the casino, it was fun! Small, but fun. In previous reviews people complained about the area. It wasn't bad at all. A couple of buildings under construction, and one that was vacant a couple of buildings away, but that did not distract from the beauty of our resort. It was also very safe. We went to Old San Juan twice, we got the local bus at the corner from the hotel (turn right when leaving the hotel). As you're waiting taxi cabs will stop and ask if you want to go to OSJ for $10 or more, but just wait, the wait for the bus isn't bad and we paid only 75 cents, make sure you have the right change. And they drop you off at the bus station in OSJ and from there you get on the free trolley, which takes you around OSJ or one that takes you to the forts. It was great!

The check in process was simple but took a while as I waited inline for approx. 15 minutes before being helped. Once it was my turn the check in was seamless. We were given a room on the 18th floor, which was wonderful, we had partial city views and partial beach views. The city views were only of those hotels and businesses around the hotel because the area the hotel is in did not have much going on. I was told there were many restaurants and things to do, however upon checking with the activity desk - nothing was really within walking distance. The beach was wonderful - the water was rough because a hurricane was coming, which made the water extremely rough. We did get rained out one day and the casino was shut down all due to the hurricane that ended up just being a bad rainstorm. I was here over labor day weekend and the hotel must have a deal with local people that they can come and use the pool for the day or something. There was at one point so many kids over ruling the pool I had to leave because I was there for relaxation and I was better served relaxing in my room (not the place I want to be on a beach vacation). The hotel amenities were great although they tried charging $5.00 for a bottle of Figi water in the hotel room - that was not happening. They did give us two water bottles everyday when the room was cleaned and the beds were extremely comfortable. The pillows were a little hard for my liking but they served their purpose. We did go to Old San Juan for a day and walked around the forts, and went to Pigeon Park, that was a fun day we just took the local bus and it dropped us off at the starting point and we chose to walk the rest of the day, we could have taken the trolley but decided against it.

It was a restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with at least 5 places to eat and all had outdoor seating. It appeared that this area was a popular hang-out and cruising strip for locals leaving work from the business district. We enjoyed the pizza at Danny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s International (although I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend the fried egg on the pizza) and we enjoyed several other restaurants right across the street from Danny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: Via Appia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Deli (Italian \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had spaghetti and filet mignon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both good); and Tijuana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bar and Grill (Mexican \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we had burrito and enchilada \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both good).

After the quick $15.00 taxi trip from the Airport to this hotel we were ready for our vacation. We reserved an oceanfront room and our friends reserved a ocean/pool view room. After checking into both our rooms I was dissappointed at the fact our room was actually smaller (30%) and our bathroom was much smaller (50%) than our friends, even though we were paying more for the oceanfront room. We went downstairs and complained and were even going to be willing to pay less and stay in their style room. The guy at the front desk was very accomodating and explained that the ocean front rooms next door the the corner ocean front rooms were smaller. (our room was 610) He moved us in the middle ocean front room on the 10th floor (1012) and it was right in line with the size our friends had paid for but ours was oceanfront. If we hadn't seen the difference in the room we wouldn't know any better and it wouldn't have been a big deal. We just hated the fact we were paying more than they were and their room was much bigger. AFter they moved us it was a non-issue. For those of you not getting the opportunity to see other rooms keep this in mind. Our overall experience after our quick room change was STELLAR! (aside from us loosing a little money in the casino ;-) Recommendations we found helpful: Room service is quite expensive. Walk just one block (leaving the hotel its towards the left) to Danny's (a restaurant) and you can get some GREAT food for a GREAT VALUE. Their pancakes were huge and two of our breakfasts were the price of just one at the hotel, plus the portions were much bigger. They are also known for their pizza! After spending lots on other restaurants our wallet needed a dinner break so we decided to head here for their pizza- it rocked! YUMMY OLD SAN JUAN! Take the taxi- don't wait for the trolley or bus, what should take 10 minutes by cab can take up to 45 minutes waiting for public transportation and then having to stop every few blocks really takes time. You don't need to sign up for a tour to visit the OLD SAN JUAN FORTS, just pay the $3.00 per person and walk it yourself. The hotel said it closed at 5pm. They just recently changed that and it now closes at 6pm (thank goodness for us as we only got there at 4:30 pm) After departing the Old San Juan Forts we walked through the shopping district and got to see all of the old houses and buildings also in \"Old San Juan\". We went to a TOP-NOTCH restaurant called AgueaViva (Jellyfish in English). They had very Fresh Seafood and unique blends of Rum Drinks that were just a little different but oh so good. Ask for Ronald to be your server- he was very knowledgeable and fun. The Beachfront in front of the Marriott is wonderful. The ocean at this beach (Condado) was a little rough. Being that we vacation yearly at Myrtle Beach that's what I have to compare it to. It was just slightly more rough than a standard Myrtle Beach ocean day. We decided to venture east towards Isla Verde to see the differnce in the beach there. It is way calmer. The Carolina Beach (publich beach) was AWESOME. You could go out 50' and the water only be chest high (I am 5'7\"). We then even went further east to check out the beach infront of the Ritz (where we would have stayed if we didn't stay at the Marriott) The water was about the same but for some reason they had a lot of sea grass in the water there, so Carolina beach would be my favorite for the calmness of the water. Snorkeling! ABSOLUTELY Check out SPREAD EAGLE II. It leaves Fjardo (eastern most area of Puerto Rico). It is a sailing catamaran that can hold up to 45 people. They sail about 45 minutes out to a deserted island and anchor feet away from the shore. You can walk the shoreline and snorkel from there. They serve a great lunch buffett, offer you unlimited sodas, water, pina coladas or rum punch all day, and snacks. After lunch they move the boat out to sea a little towards another reef and there at that spot it was unbelieveable the different fish you see. They give you bread to feed to the fish. **buy a cheap underwater camera to capture the unforgettable views** Within a block from the hotel is Walgreens (towards the right as you leave the hotel) They sell groceries so you can stock up on milk, oj, breakfast stuff and snacks for you room. Your room (all of them do) has a mini fridge so you can keep drinks cold in there. Just across the street from the hotel (can't remember the name of it) there is a bar that serves 2-for-1 drink specials during happy hour. You can get two good pina coladas for the price of 1/2 what the marriott charges. They also have a bucket of beers (5) for the price of 2 at the Marriott. Casino: We enjoyed the Casino at the Marriott but there is something you should be aware of if you are a big Black Jack Player. The way the play the dealer's hand. They deal you your 2 cards, but only deal the dealer 1 until after everyone playing decides to hit or stay. (Most places in the US deal the dealer their 2 cards at beginning) This can be bad for two reason- 1 if you think what other players do (like stay on 14 when a dealer has a 7 showing) can mess the table up this is the place it will. Also, if the dealer gets Black Jack you won't know it until the very end, sometimes after you have decided to split 8's and doubled down which means you can loose more money on hands you though were great. We found on the last night we were there another Newer hotel down the street (2 blocks towards right if you are leaving the Marriott) that had a bigger and better Casino that plays Black Jack the normal way. It's called La Conche (my memory is not very good on the name of this one). It's a modern-furnished hotel with tons of water fountains/features on the outside just outside of the lobby. Everything is newer and there are more tables and slots. We were going to go to the Baccardi tour but ran out of time. We spoke with other couples about our age (mid 30's - early 40's) and they all said it wasn't worth the time so we didn't feel to bad about it in the end.", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGood location but not as clean as other Marriotts\u201d", "Author": "trvlcrzy", "ReviewID": "UR47367197", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights at the end of August 2009.

A couple of days passed, and we noticed our bathroom floors not being cleaned. Everytime we returned, there's sand, hair, dirt on the floor. I had to clean it myself and I checked with my friend's room next door, same story. So, one day I placed a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on our room door. Fine, but they didn't clean my friend's room either and when she called to complain, they mentioned that housekeeping had called to her room and somebody confirmed not to clean her room. How can that be if we were all gone the whole day (in Culebra) and got back in the evening already. OK. At least management sent someone right away when we complained and gave her a wine/cheese and fruit treats.

I am a frequent review reader and realize how difficult it can be to ascertain the validity of differing reviews. As background, we are frequent vactioners, generally stay at 4-5 (and sometimes higher) star hotels, have done both all inclusive and regular resort stays. The Marriott in Condado is a typical, recently renovated Marriott. The rooms are lovely - and look excactly like the pictures on the website. Service was impecible, much quicker than I have found at some other beach resorts (Aruba comes to mind), but it is also a smaller property than those, and that could account for quicker service. Prices are typical Marriott, i.e. $12 for a burger on the beach. But, you are paying for service at your lounge - not a fast food, drive through. They had plenty of drink specials, and served top quality liquors. Nice sized casino, live music in the lobby on weekends. Location was typical city neighborhood, but the property inself was insulated from city noise. The beach was beautiful. Just remember - this is the Atlantic Ocean, not the Caribbean Seas, and therefore it is wavy not calm. Pool area seemed adequate for a resort of this size - but I simply cant understand why you would go to a resort like this and sit at the pool anyway. This is a beach resort and an excellent one, at that. San Juan is a great, easy getaway from the East Coast - no hassle with customs/passports since you are still in the US, lots of direct or at least short flights. Great restaurants. Ate one dinner at the hotel, at Tuscany, and it was fine for a lazy night. But you are missing out if you dont try some of the restaurants in the Condado neighborhood or Old San Juan.

The food was mediocre at best and though the wait staff was friendly enough, language was a real problem as very few spoke English and getting an order right was a real challenge. The other hotel staff was also English challenged, and I thought this was just how it was on the island until I moved to the Hilton and found all staff able to communicate in English. I understand it is said Americans expect everyone to speak English, and though I appreciate and respect other languages of the world, when I go to a 4 Star Resort Hotel that caters to Americans, I expect to be able to communicate.

It was very clean, very nicely decorated, great (but on the smaller side) pool split into a shallow side (perfect for sitting in) on the upper level and a deeper side on the lower level (also with a swim up bar), with a nice little water slide to connect them. Housekeeping was excellent and the room we had (garden/pool view with king bed) was beautiful. The section of beach was probably the nicest in Condado. Many people commented on the \"RED\" Flag (indicating the ocean was too dangerous to go in). The flag was always out but I'm not a particularly strong swimmer and had no problems body surfing very safely. The beach attendants were prompt and helpful with chairs and umbrellas. The hotel has 24 hours on site taxi service and hertz car rental if you want to take a road trip. Casino small but $5 tables every night, all night. As with ALL Marriott's, the on site costs for everything from food/drinks to spa treatments are expensive. We went out for all food/drink. People also commented on some abandoned buildings visible from the hotel. The area was apparently hit hard by a hurricane several years back and that, plus the economy being poor, has made rebuilding slow. There are renovations going on to most of the properties in need of it right now, though its not at all noisy or intrusive to your experience. Just a few tips we would have found helpful. ***The taxi cabs are supposed to follow rates set by some governing body but in every one of the cabs we took, the driver tried to rip us off by over quoting. Each tourist area (i.e. airport, old san juan, condado, etc) is is a \"zone\" and there's a placard in the cab telling you how much it should cost. every driver tried to over charge by at least $2, and when confronted, casually blew it off. if possible, try to get a copy of the rate slip (i think you can at the taxi area in the airport) so they'll be no surprises. ***in some restaurants, a 15% tip (spanish word-\"propina\") is included in the check. make sure you look before adding in more. ***try the local restaurants. cafe del angel was good. ajili mojili was a bit pricey but very nice and a short walk from the hotel. also-from the marriott, make a left and walk about 2-3 blocks. there's a bunch of restaurants with outdoor seating that make for a great atmosphere. also- we went to a walgreens about 2 blocks away and stocked up on water and snacks for a fraction of the cost of on site prices. ***El Yunque-we rented a car ($40) for the day and drove there. very easy to find it (mostly highway). if you only have a few hours there, suit up and hike to La MIna Falls. We did it from the Big Tree Trail-about 35 minutes (easy to moderate hike)---enough to work up a litle sweat. When you get to the falls, it looks and sounds scary. The water also feels a bit chilly. I can tell you it is neither. Squat so your center of gravity is low and go for it! It made my whole trip to the rain forest perfect. if you have more time, some of the other hikes are okay. all have clearly marked paths to follow. also-there's some roadside grill/cafes for a snack. bring water, a poncho, bathing suit, towels, bug spray (the web site says to bring spray but we never had to use it-apparently october is low season for bugs too) and a camera. overall very nice trip-5 days to explore old san juan, 1 day at el yunque, and lots of beach/pool time was the perfect amount of time", "Date": "October 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hekesq", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but watch for the extras\u201d", "Author": "hekesq", "ReviewID": "UR45612404", "Content": "Just came back from PR and stayed at this hotel.

We couldn't get a suite to accommodate 5 people so we had to go with two rooms. Our deal included the 5th night free and 2 free breakfast buffets at La Vista per room along with a $100 debit card per room. All of this was very useful since the hotel and San Juan itself is pricey. The first issue at check-in was that we didn't have adjoining rooms which I requested months in advance. Our rooms started out on different floors which was unacceptable. Finally, they were able to get us two rooms on the fifth floor down the hall from one another. We had booked one room with a king bed for myself and my husband and a room with two double beds for the kids. However, in order to be on the same floor, we had to take two rooms both with king beds so our second room needed a rollaway. I wasn't thrilled with that arrangement for the kids but it was the best they could do. There was no way the hotel was at full occupancy in late July so I was somewhat surprised that they couldn't accommodate us. However, things improved from there. The beach was the main attraction for us. My husband and I had stayed here about 8 years ago for a long weekend and my husband remembered loving the beach. Well, he was right. The kids LOVED the ocean. It must have been 80 degrees with large waves great for body-surfing. We have been to places like Aruba where there is so surf so the kids loved the waves. They stayed in for hours at a time even though the red flags (dangerous surf) were always flying. If my kids were young, I would have been very worried about the waves and the undertow so families with little ones should think about whether they want to be on a beach this rough. As resort guests, we had no problems getting 5 lounge chairs and an umbrella every day - the beach really was not that crowded. We didn't take advantage of the beach-side massage but did indulge in the gelato from a guy who walks the beach every day with a cart. We tended to leave the beach around 3 pm and head to the pool which is very shaded. There were plenty of lounge chairs available but it was hard to get one in the sun. The pool has a large area for younger kids and an area for adults with a swim up pool bar. The drinks are expensive so we would indulge in one fruity cocktail or smoothies for the kids but we brought our own cooler with soda and beer. The buffet breakfast at La Vista is very good but it would have cost about $120 per day for the 5 of us to eat there. With 4 free buffets at $20 per person, it made sense to go and only have to pay for one. The fresh fruit was great, belgian waffles and omelets were delicious and my boys loved the all-you-can-eat bacon and sausage. We basically loaded up at breakfast and then just brought snacks to the beach skipping lunch. There is a Walgreens two blocks away to the right of the hotel so we bought snacks and sodas there. For dinner, we walked up and down Ashford Avenue and were very pleased with the choices. We had Japanese hibachi at Cherry Blossom right next door to the hotel (very good but expensive), ate at Cafe del Angel down the road to the right (authentic Puerto Rican food reasonably priced), we did the $20 Toscany menu one night which is available at the Marriott between 5 - 7 pm (for the price, it was very worth it with good Italian food), we also had Mexican food down the road (take a left out of the hotel) and had pizza at Via Appia (I think that's the name). We really did not have bad meal. There is also a Subway a few blocks down the road (take a right out of the hotel) so we let our boys eat there one night since we knew they might not like Cafe del Angel. If you are used to a city, either New York, Boston, even Oahu in Hawaii, you will feel fine walking up and down Ashford Avenue. There are some homeless people, a few boarded up shops but no one ever bothered us and tons of people are out walking at night. The Marriott is in a great, convenient location so we did not need a car at all. One day, we took a cab to Old San Juan (for a Segway tour which was fantastic!!!) and we booked a tour Rainforest/Bio Bay tour through www.kayakingpuertorico.com which I would highly recommend. Other than those two excursions, we hung around at the beach, pool, and around the Marriott. On a couple of nights, all 5 of us crowded into one room to watch a pay per view movie which was fun. All in all, it was a very nice trip for the 5 of us to spend together since we are usually running in different directions. The staff at the Marriott is very nice, efficient, and provided the kind of service you would expect. The rooms were clean but basic. Our only room issue was the small refrigerator in our kids room smelled (like bad cheese!) and I called to have it replaced or cleaned and it was never done. Everyone loved the fitness center and my husband went every day. The main draw for the Marriott is the great location on a great beach with a standard of service you can rely on.

Room. All of ocean-front rooms were nicely appointed, clean and modern. The bedding was very comfortable and had obviously been recently upgraded. The balconies are private, and had two chairs and a small table. Each room had mini-refrigerator, coffee maker, and central air-conditioning. The bathroom was clean, spacious, modern and featured good quality toiletries. Service/Staff. The staff was all very friendly and professional. Lobby. Upon entering the hotel, the bar & dance floor is immediately ahead while the reception area is to the left, and the guest lounge area is behind it. The problem with this arrangement is that the band or recorded music is so loud that you have to shout at the reception staff to be heard. In addition, we found the lounge areas to be unusable as a meeting place because we could not hear each other. I think Marriott's original intention was to have a festive atmosphere as soon as you enter the building - but they miscalculated on this one Pool & Beach. The pool area is great! There are tons of lounge chairs and a shallow pool for smaller children. The private beach is nice, but although it is raked every morning there is still a ton of discarded cigarette butts in the sand. The water is clean, but the constant wave/tidal action prevents the water from being crystal-clear like a lot of Caribbean beaches. There were no vendors hawking jewelry, or hair-braiding etc. Casino. The casino has many slot machines (pennies thru dollars) and we found them to pay about as well as any in Vegas. Cocktail service is not what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect in Vegas though, but they will bring you a sandwich or pastries if you have ask for them. Food. After reading the Trip Advisor reviews, we skipped eating at the hotel except for RISTORANTE TUSCANY. Where we dined twice and took advantage of their $20 three-course dinner menu. The atmosphere was very nice - but still allowed us to dress casually - the food was good, but nothing special. Nearby dining options: LATIN STAR, open 24 hours, it serves very reasonable breakfast ($4-$6) it also has very good Mofongo ($12) appetizer plates ($10) and Carne Guisada ($9). For great pizza, try DANNY's (Large: $15-19). Across the street is TIJUANAs, which serves very good Mexican food (Prices: $12-18)! Old San Juan: we ate at the CAFE PUERTO RICO several times and really enjoyed it, although we found the Mofongo to be a bit too bland and dry. Groceries. Stock the in-room mini fridges with cokes, milk, juices etc, from the nearby Walgreens (they also have some groceries). Beer, wine and liquor can be found a few blocks in the other direction, but be prepared to pay for it: a 12 pack of 10oz Budweiser costs $16, and Medalla light (a truly awful, but ubiquitous local beer) costs $14. The best place to buy liquor is actually at the airport, as you're allowed to shop there upon arrival. Transportation - Taxi. Fares from the airport are pre-set by attendants that issue tickets stating the fare. It cost $23 for the 15 minute ride from the airport to the hotel. However, if you use a taxi from the hotel, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll want to ask the driver in advance how much the fare will be (trust me). Transportation - Bus. Bus fare is only 75 cents. It takes about 25 minutes to reach Old San Juan. However, the wait can be quite long (we waited 45 minutes one day, and 90 minutes the next day).

Still, there was the occasional propeller plane that went by the beach, but nothing really distracting. It's located in an area called Condado which is west of the airport and a few miles away from Old San Juan. The area is nice and upscale with hotels and expensive condo developments. On Ashford Ave. (the street in front of the hotel) there are a few boutique shops, banks, a Walgreens (which was nice to have), a Starbucks, a Hertz car rental, and a few restaurants within walking distance. The restaurants have a wide range of cuisine and the food was good (not great, not bad). (I'd suggest eating early, because many of the restaurants fill up fast, which would leave you waiting out in front) The one thing I'd have to mention is that I didn't feel like I got any traditional cuisine, since the restaurants were Italian, Argentinean, Mexican, etc. The hotel was clean, the service excellent and friendly. Everyone speaks English. I'd suggest a balcony facing the ocean. You get two free bottles of water each day, and an empty refrigerator, which came in handy. On the beach you can get towels, umbrellas and chairs (put up for you), and drinks. The beach is nice. There is a big bar in the main lobby with music and entertainment each night and a casino. Nothing too exciting, but maybe easier than taking a taxi somewhere. The breakfast buffet at Vista was good, but we didn't eat at Tuscany (the Italian restaurant) All-in-all, our stay was enjoyable and the hotel was great. We traveled in late July / early Aug. It wasn't as hot as we thought. 85 degrees and 75 percent humidity. At the beach there was always a nice cool wind which can be deceiving, so watch out for the sunburn! Get under that umbrella. The humidity isn't so apparent until you walk outside with your camera and the lens fogs up. We went to El Yunque (rainforest) which was nice. I'd suggest going early and on a weekday. Apparently it really fills up fast and you can get stuck in traffic on a thin mountain road with tour buses going in each direction. Renting a car and driving is easy. You might want to bring something in case it rains, protection for your camera, water, hiking shoes, and swimming gear if you go down to the waterfall to swim. You're mostly shaded among humid, dripping trees in the rainforest. Old San Juan is beautiful. Don't drive there! The streets are very narrow and crowded. A cab costs $14 and bus 75 cents. It's very hilly, so bring practical shoes (sandals were perfect). The fort is very nice and gives you some nice views of the city. Bring water for the heat and the climbing. It will go fast. If you don't, there's plenty of food and drink available. This district has lots of shopping (traditional (hats and cigars), modern (handmade purses), tourist (shot glasses), and retail (Coach, Burberry). We stopped a few times to avoid the heat.

We had a city view room that offered a partial ocean view. In addition we were on the 15th floor so we could leave the slider open and listen to the ocean at night.

The Marriott should not nickel and dime people like this, they are the big company who buys in bulk and they should be offering reasonably priced items. There were no water sports offered at the beach which was a little disappointing. The area surrounding the hotel was rundown to include several closed hotels; some appeared recently closed others closed for some time and strewn with graffiti. There are numerous homeless subjects around and they will aggressively beg and pander for money. In the stretch by the Marriott you will not find more than 2-3 open properties in a row without encountering a closed/rundown property. There was also poor balance with the live bands in the lobby meaning the band was soooo loud you could not have a drink or conversation at the bar or anywhere else on the main level. You could not talk to the front desk or Concierge because it was soooo loud. Also do not pay for the Bacardi tour $56 a person with a little shopping thrown in; you can do it on your own for approximately $7.50 a person. Take the bus downtown, .75ct walk 2 blks to the ferry terminal and take the .50ct ferry across the harbor then a $3 cab ride to the Bacardi factory for the free tour to include 2 free drinks per person. Miro-- has great garlic shrimp, cherry blossoms has great bankok and curry shrimp. Orazcos has awesome mufongo and seafood paella. ..........overall our trip was very good, 10th anniversary so we would not let anything bother us but Aruba is much better in every aspect, this would not be in my top 5 of places to return to. Not much in San Juan seemed to be designed for tourists most signs in Spanish only, I have been in other countries where I have seen more english than in this U.S. Territory. If you would like a more trendy chic hotel La Concha also a Marriott property a few blocks down is presently renovating but the rooms there are bigger and the place is more contemporary than the Stellaris; they have the right balance musically and a great layout in the lobby area with the lighting and bar.

Front desk sent us to spa to change when we checked in early at 12 to change, shower while waiting for our room. They have shampoo, conditioner, anything you need! We changed and stayed by the pool until our room was ready at 4. Could not have been any nicer! Location is great and just a 5 minute bus or car ride to old San Juan. We took a taxi once and used the bus on the corner after this. Bus runs every 30 minutes, B21 takes you directly to old San Juan, but C53 also goes to the old city and the drivers are very nice and gave us directions to the historical sites when we asked. We caught the bus back from the terminal which is located right beside of the police station, it departs every 30 minutes until 9 oclock. Nice high end shops within walking distance from hotel with some touristy type shops also. Rooms were gorgeous, housekeeping were immaculate, elegant rooms with wonderful showers! AC goes off when patio doors are open, but room cools down quickly! The room had no odor and was very fresh and elegantly decorated! The staff at this hotel were the best. From the bell boys, to the beach/pool attendants, waitress/waiters were great! Everyone went out of their way to be nice and accomodating. Pool side service very laid back, a little slow but this is the Carribean, part of the atmosphere! We purchased the breakfast buffet with our room and I would highly recommend doing this. Breakfast was awesome! Pancakes, waffles and omlettes made to order with a variety of blueberries/ cherries and hot syrup! Fruits were delicious. This would have been very expensive but purchasing with room made it very affordable! Restaurants are very expensive but the same as any high end resort! Again, can not wait to back.

There is a computer with restaurants, and their menus can be printed out at the concierge desk. Ask to use this! There are all sorts of places to buy snacks and soda and wine for the room withing walking distance too. The hotel is on the bus line to Old San Juan and El Morro.

We enjoy going there for the night life and the shopping. We love Marriott's La Concha, just a few buildings down for their very large rooms by San Juan standards, but I really fell for Stellaris this time and it'll be nice to have options. I loved how nice the staff was. Early the same week we were staying at the Hiltons Caribe, just outside of Old San Juan and every member of that staff acted like I was putting them out when they greeted me so we decided to move to a different hotel our last few nights. I am so glad we moved, it was totally worth the hassle and giving up a little vacation time. Our checkin was incredibly fast and very friendly. We stuck with the city view and am very glad we did. Our balcony was about 20 ft long and had incredible views of San Juan. The room had color! So many of the hotels in san juan are done in shades of beige that depress me. Wonderful pops of yellow throughout the room with a large white pristine bed. Now I'm a bathroom girl, meaning the bathroom makes the room for me. And even though this was a base room it did not let me down. It was of average size (which is roomy for san juan), with a large vanity and a wonderful little tub that turned out to be a really good deep soaking tub. In the caribbean you mostly have showers to save precious water so I love a good tub while on vacation. Lastly I love the Condado area. It feels like a beach town to me even though its in a big city. Isla Verde always feels too crowded to me and Old San Juan (unfortunately) has no nice hotels. So its a nice area you can easily walk around and be fine and maybe even see a free concrete or two. The only negative about the hotel I have is the lobby is very plain. The decor remind me more of a fairfield inn then a full marriott. Especially when most of the hotels in San Juan have beautifully lobbies. It had a great tall ceiling but everything else looked like a cold corporate hotel at first. But everything after my initial impression was great. Also we bid on priceline for this so we had a great rate in my opinion. I don't think I would be willing to pay over $200 to stay here, but our rate was much lower.

The hotel was very large with lots going on - a few different restaurants, a large lobby bar with different live music every night, the Stellaris Casino and pool and beach with games. Even during the quiet hours of the afternoon we could always find amusement simply sitting in the lobby or by the pool drinking Pina Coladas and people watching. We really didn't need to find amusement though. The hotel was in walking distance of shopping, restaurants and bars. The pool had activities in the afternoon, a swim up bar and lounger service. I didn't make it to the beach much, but it was very large and would make for a fantastic stroll. The activities desk made all our reccommendations and arrangements for different off site entertainment, which certainly did not disappoint. For our own adventures, taxis were always at the front to take us to Old San Juan or anywhere else. Old San Juan was a quick cab ride away, and never cost our large group more than $20. Very reasonable. The rooms were very comfortable and very clean, I could have slept in that bed forever. My only complaint was the inconsistency of the service. The front desk, concierge and housekeeping staff were all extremely helpful and accommodating. Bar, casino, pool and restaurant - mostly wait staff, not so much They certainly put the \"wait\" in wait staff. We spent quite a lot of time and money on the first night in the casino and found it nearly impossible to get service. However, after a bit of speaking with the pit boss a couple nights later, they were kind enough to give us our own table AND service. Although it didn't bother me, there was lot of noise and commotion in the lobby and probably not too much to do for small children. All the activities would be brilliant for teenagers and up. Also probably not the best locale for romace and relaxation, unless you are an active and outgoing couple. Not sure on the total value of the room as my dad picked up the tab (thanks!) but I do know that the food and drinks were a bit over the top.

First room was on the 4th floor in a corner room and did not really have a view. I would ask for a high floor room. A/C could not really keep up as half of the room was windows. Morning sun hit the room and I think that added to the cooling issue. The air vent doesn't blow towards the bed, so I think they should add another vent in the room. The lowest temp is 65 and the room never really felt like it was reaching that temp. It had a \"just cleaned the carpet\" smell that we noticed right away. Called maintenance on the TV as the remote was not working. Supervisor came up with another one and it didn't work. Maintenance team (2 guys) came up and worked on it. Ultimately replaced the TV from another room. Spent 1st night in the room and then decided to ask for another room. The front desk staff was very helpful. They had another room on the 18th floor (smaller room than the corner room and they told us) that faced the ocean and let me and my wife look at it first. We decided to take the room and had the hotel bell staff help us with moving to the new room. We tried to tip the bellman, but he didn't want the tip as he felt the hotel had the responsibility to make sure we were happy. Very impressed with his help. The larger room looked good on paper, but it didn't work for us. Give it a try and see how you like it. As with the other reports, the drink prices are high ($8.50). We found a little grocery store down the street on Ashford Ave(out the hotel and turn left - a few blocks) that had gin/tonic/limes. Also agree the breakfast buffet was over priced ($20 pp) for the selections you had. We went to Danny's International 2 blocks away (out the hotel and turn left - a couple of blocks on the left). Interesting item was the potato used for breakfast was french fries. Starbucks across the street had bagels and breads for breakfast. The hotel also has a coffee shop in the lobby if you don't want to walk across the street. Plenty of choices for food on Ashford Ave. We hit the Chinese food place just to the right of the hotel on Ashford. We also found a Pizza Uno and Fudruckers burger place on Ashford (go out the hotel and turn left - 4 blocks). Tijuanas was good. Don't be in a hurry for any place you go. Service is a little slower all over. Felt safe with many police officers up and down the street. The PR government officials understand the value of tourism dollars and don't want anything to happen. Decided to rent a car from Hertz for 3 days. Self parking at the hotel is $16 per day. I would make a reservation on-line and then pick up the car from the Hertz location 3 blocks down on Ashford. The Hertz location in the hotel lobby will charge you an extra 10% because they are in the lobby. We did return the car to the Hertz location in the lobby because they won't charge you the 10% for returning the car. We drove to the caves/radio telescope. It takes about 1.5 hours to get there and you will hit some toll roads on the way. We also drove to the rain forest and across the island to Ponce(tolls too). Ask the hotel for directions if you decide to drive. Be aware drivers in PR make up their own rules for driving. They stop anywhere they want and have never heard of a signal. They also drive slow in the fast lane. Cabs can take you everywhere. Everything is flat rate or the rate the driver wants to charge you. Hard to tell if you are getting over charged. Ask the driver what the rate is before you get in. Took a cab to old San Juan. Rode the free trolley that goes by the forts. Went down to Pier #2 and took the ferry to the Bacardi factory (.50 cents each way). When you get off the boat, turn right and you will see some cabs and other vans that will take you for $3 each way. You can't really walk to the factory. The tour gives you 2 free drinks and then takes you to the visitors center. They don't take you actually inside the plant to see the process. Old San Juan and the Bacardi tour took about the whole day so plan your time. The casino's were good to us. Wife hit 3 jackpots (2 at the Marriott and 1 at the La Concha, A Renaissance Resort down the street - Out the hotel and turn right - 4 blocks). The Marriott has a live band in the evening, so the casino was more crowded than I liked. Had several graduation/proms going on from Thur - Sat, which added more people in the lobby. I had more fun at the La Concha casino because it wasn't as crowded and I could play the tables or slots without much waiting. Both serve free drinks and they were good drinks. I used this site to read other reviews before we arrived, so I wanted to contribute to the folks deciding to stay at this hotel. I would recommend the Marriott Stellaris and you will have a good time.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel on Condado Beach\u201d", "Author": "DelcoMom", "ReviewID": "UR30519592", "Content": "My family vacationed in San Juan in April and the Marriott was a nice property. We had never been to Puerto Rico, so we decided to go with a hotel brand we were familiar with and used Marriott points for our room. The hotel is located in the city of San Juan, so it was different for us from other resorts that tend to be in more secluded areas. Overall, the area is quite safe for a city and there were quite a few nice restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. I would highly recommend Ajili Mojili, an upscale place serving local PR fare. We found the concierge very helpful and pleasant in making dining recommendations. The rooms were nice, nothing too overwhelming. We were booked into a city view room, but we actually had an angle view of the beach, with the city the other way. The city was very pretty at night. The pool at the hotel was quite small for the number of rooms, and busy due to the holiday (Easter week). The beach was not crowded as the red flag was flying every day we were there. If you want to do beach, I would not recommend a hotel on Condado. This side of the island is the rough surf side. As with all Marriott's, they have a \"no save\" chair policy at the pool, and as with all Marriott's, they do not enforce it. So by 8:00am, there were lots of chairs with a towel thrown on them to save. This made it difficult to find two chairs together on the lower pool deck. But if the chairs remained empty, we would move from upper to lower deck, and just take a chair. No one ever said a word to us. The pool has a waterslide which is open from 11:00am-3:00pm. Very popular with kids and grown ups alike. There is also a swim up bar, and pool waitservice, although there was not enough staff for the busy holiday, and it was often difficult to get their attention and get assistance. It was easier to go to the bar and get it yourself. The hotel has several restaurants onsite. We only ate at La Vista, a casual dining place that had a nice breakfast. Prices are resort fare. No surprises there. The hotel has a huge lobby bar, which has live music almost every night. They also have happy hour drink prices every afternoon, which was nice for a resort property. The casino is not huge, but adequate, if the is your thing. It was closed for several days when we were there, due to the Easter holiday. This is PR law, not hotel choice. The island itself is very nice. We rented a car for several days (Hertz is in the lobby) and toured around by ourselves. The roads in San Juan are well marked and very much like any other large city. The drivers are crazy! So make sure you are prepared for their recklessness. I would recommend El Junque rainforest, but I would also tell you to go the other direction and see Arecibo Observatory as well as Camuy Cave park. Both are fascinating places and well worth the hour drive. Word of advice, go early! Camuy Cave Park is extremely popular and sells out. Get there by 10:00a to ensure you get in. We did the other \"regular\" tourist things, like the Bacardi factory and Old San Juan. Both were crowded due to multiple cruise ships being in port. If you drive into Old San Juan, be prepared to spend some time looking for parking. There are several large lots, but they fill up by early afternoon. Overall, we had a very nice time in San Juan. The Marriott was as we expected; nothing more or less.

I really give this place a thumbs up. Here are some specifics: Ride from airport less than 15 minutes. $20 w/tip. Greeted nicely on arrival by Robert who took our bags and directed us to check in. Midred checks us in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6very friendly and very patient explaining everything. We upgraded from a double city view to a high floor (15) ocean view king and we get a corner room with two balconies ($75 extra per nite but IMO worth it). Room is very clean and spacious, great views. Robert is at the door with our luggage within five minutes. Room has nice bathroom amenities, bathrobes (we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use them) fridge, safe, desk area and sitting area and really comfy bed & did I mention the view? One balcony is direct ocean view the other a side view of the ocean to our right and then a view back to the city. Here are some other likes & a few dislikes: Like: Fast and always available elevators. Nice pool area, nice beach, lots of chairs in both locations, no need to do the chair dance. Beach and pool areas are spotless. Lots of towels and we always ask for four and never a problem (it has been at other places we stayed). Everyone, and I mean everyone greeted us with a smile or hello day or night. Always asked if we needed anything or needed help. Lobby bar staff very friendly. Casino staff friendly as well. Location is perfect for the Condado. Restaurants a short walk to the left or right as exiting the hotel. Local or Mexican style food (we liked Tijuana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsmall but lively). Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall all the places but lots to choose from and we liked them all, just some more expensive than others. Also some of the names we all are familiar with are nearby as well. Chili\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, Uno Pizzeria etc. Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a block away to the right. Liquor stores a short walk either left or right (shorter to the left). Beer was $9.95 a six pack\u00e2\u20ac\u201dstill cheaper than drinking at the hotel bar. Starbucks directly across the street. A few touristy stores in walking distance. A relatively short cab ride to Old San Juan. We paid a variety of prices for cabs to and from OSJ\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6$12 - $15. Not sure why because it is supposed to be zone to zone pricing. Definitely visit OSJ and at least one of the forts. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like: Hotel prices are steep (IMO). Two beers at the lobby bar = $14. USA today in the gift shop = $3.50. Now the bars around the hotel weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a lot cheaper but they were cheaper @ $4 - $5 for a beer. Casino\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6slots seemed tight and, while yes there are free drinks, service is slow, and drinks are small. Beach bar---there is a small one and they advertise Happy Hour 4 -6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6however we paid the same price at Happy Hour ($6.50 - $8.00) as we would any other time. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happy about that? Overall, however, I would definitely recommend the Marriot Stellaris and would return. This is a nicely located hotel for everything from morning coffee to evening dinner and drinks.

We selected the Marriott in San Juan because we have always had such wonderful experiences with Marriott, especially enjoying their PHENOMENAL resort in Curacao. In San Juan, we were disappointed! Except for the attentive doormen and bell staff, service is POOR. The hotel was merely that.... it was not a resort and was more in line with a business class hotel. If you are not blessed with sunshine to allow you to take advantage of the pool and the beach, there is pretty much nothing else to do around the hotel except spend time in the casino or at the pricey bar. There are no organized activities (as we found at other resorts) and in the evening, if you want to sit in the lobby lounge to listen to music, you are forced to a two drink minimum per person. While this could include soda or coffee, the prices would be enough to keep you away. When I asked what the \"resort fee\" covered, the rather rude desk attendee said it covered the \"free\" wireless internet access available throughout the hotel (although you can make use of the business center on the lower level and unless you travel on vacation with a laptop, who would need that?) and the umbrellas at the beach (which is not private). When I asked if there was anything else, she had no response. The best part of the hotel was, of course, the classic Marriott bed and clean room. We were lucky to get a cabana room which offered great views of the pool and ocean. The cleaning staff was especially attentive and we returned to our room each day to find comfort and cleanliness. While the restaurants are pricey, we found that at Tuscany, neither the service nor the food seemed to justify the cost. We frequently dine at fine restaurants and don't mind paying up for good food, but this was not worth it. We found better options right along Ashford Avenue. The best sushi can be found right next door. Yees has terrific sushi, as well as a separate area where you can sit around the hibachi table. Heads up, though... if you sit down in the sushi bar, bring a sweater because it is intentionally kept cooler (raw fish, you know). The owner is attentive and the food is delicious.

We had a cabana room, which we were told cannot be reserved in advance. They can be requested once you arrive if you've already reserved a pool or ocean view room (not city view). We liked the cabana view much, much better than the pool or ocean view rooms. It looked directly out over the pool to the ocean. The pool view rooms in the tower face sideways and you really get a city view. Just a matter of preference, I guess. My biggest complaint of the hotel is that the lobby area is not open-air. This is the only beach hotel that we've ever stayed that had a closed, highly air-conditioned lobby area. Other beach hotels we've stayed had open-air lobby areas which felt tropical and gives you an island feel. Since this one is closed, and highly air-conditioned (I was cold in t-shirt and shorts), the entrance feels more like a business hotel. You walk directly into a large bar area with T.V's on the wall. Feels like a combo sports bar and business hotel at the same time, if that makes any sense. Since I was looking for a hotel with an island feel, I was very disappointed at the overall feel of the hotel. The view from my cabana room helped to make up for it (not completely, but it helped). We considered switching hotels so we could get something that felt more island-like or something with more character in old san juan. In the end, the Marriott had enough to offer (i.e. good location and reasonable price) to keep us there, so we did not switch hotels. A definite plus was the service. Each employee we encountered was very nice and helpful. We did not have a bad experience with any employee. Everyone was great - from the bell hop to the front desk employees, to the concierge, casino workers, restaurant workers, etc. All were fantastic.

The hotel grounds are beautiful and the staff was very friendly. The bathroom was a little small in our room. but otherwise was OK. The hotel provided our room with complimentary travel size Bath & Body Works body wash, shampoo, conditioner and lotion (Aromatherapy - Orange Ginger) which smelled nice and was a nice change from the generic stuff you get at most hotels. Our room package included breakfasts at La Vista and the buffet was very good . We particularly liked the fact that it didn't offer the exact same buffet options every day. We didn't manage to eat at the Tuscany Restaurant, but during our stay, the hotel offered a 3-course meal at Tuscany for $20 per person. There are lots of restaurant options in the Condado area and within walking distance to the hotel. We liked Buenos Ayres (an Argentinian restaurant) and Danny's International. The location of the San Juan Marriott is excellent and the Condadao area is very safe. It is a $16 cab ride to the airport (SJU) and a $12 cab ride to Old San Juan. On one visit to Old San Juan, we shared a cab with another couple (costing us $3 each) and we took the bus back to the hotel for 75 cents each. Please note that the bus does not take dollar bills, only coins, so you need to have the bus fare in he exact amount of tcoins only. We only have 2 relatively minor complaints about the San Juan Marriott. First, we booked the Romance Package for our stay, which included complimentary breakfast at La Vista, a bottle of champagne and a 55-min. couples massage at the spa. The hotel needs to do a better job of educating its front desk personnel about this package. When we checked in, the guy checking us in was not familiar with this package and just thought we got the complimentary breakfast. I had to tell him what was included (and then he verified with his superiors). When we were checking out, we were charged for the couples massage at the spa. Again, I had to tell the girl at the front desk that the massage was included in our package and she, after verifying with her superiors, took the charge off our bill. I'm sure the Marriott offers several different vacation packages, but if any personnel should know the specifics about these packages, it should be the front desk workers. Second, the spa is poorly organized/managed. When we arrived for our couples massage, we were told that they were running behind because a facial machine broke down, and we would be delayed by 20-25 minutes. The girl then suggested we could sit in the dry spa if we would like. She gave each of us keys to our lockers, which had our robes in it, but did not give us spa sandals/slippers until we asked. We had to walk around in the changing area and out to the front desk to get slippers. When we were done with the dry spa, the front desk girl put us in a room to sit. We waited an additional 40 MINUTES until we were eventually given our massages. Other than the last 5 minutes we were in the waiting area, no one from the spa bothered to check on us or see if we wanted some tea or water. No one ever personally apologized to us for the delay, but to make amends, the spa sent us a bottle of wine, cheese, crackers and fruit to our room to make amends for the delays. Had they not done that, we probably would have asked the hotel to refund some of our money for the massages. The massages, though, were very good. There were several families staying at this hotel and it had a nice size wading pool for the little kids and a water slide. If you are looking for a family friendly hotel, this would fit the bill.

We opted not to upgrade since a view was not a must for us. We were pleasantly surprised when we got to our room that we had a great partial view of the ocean (see photo). If you are interested in the ocean view, ask if you have a partial view before you upgrade. We found this more than adequate. We did not eat any meals at the hotel. Some of the local restaurants we went to were Ummo (expensive), Miro (right across the street. Nice), and Tijuana. Tijuana was the best of the three. Another tip - take the city bus into Old San Juan instead of a taxi. It is only 75 cents - be sure you have exact change! At the hotel, they told us the bus number was B21, which is correct. You can also take C53, however, and we saw more of that bus around. We took both and were fine.

We decided to have a vacation extension since we had to fly through SJU to go home anyways and I thought my husband would really like the city of San Juan. This is my third trip to San Juan, but one of those being on a short cruise stop. The Marriott is about a 20 min drive or taxi from Luis Munoz airport. As of this time period, a taxi ride to this hotel from the airport cost $15 each way, plus $1 per piece of luggage you have. Our flight from St. Lucia arrived very early in San Juan - at 9:30 in the morning. After going through immigration and customs and getting a taxi, we arrived at the hotel around 10:15. We had scheduled an independent tour through Kayak Puerto Rico that would be picking us up at 12:00. So we were hoping deep down that a room would be available, but knowing it was probably a very small chance. Sure enough, we were told that a room was not available yet as check-out time was 11am. However, that we were the first people for our room type so we would be the first ones in line to get a room. They gave us a restaurant pager and said we could feel free to check out the hotel and they would let us know when a room became available. The bell station held all of our luggage for us during this time. We took turns checking out the casino and walking around and grabbed some food from the downstairs coffee bar. Well unfortunately (but since check-in wasn't until 3pm, we can't fault them in any way), our room was not ready in time before we were to be picked up for our tour. We simply returned the pager and they said they would call us when the room became available. We had to laugh that they called saying our room was available about 15 minutes after we left. We appreciated them trying to get us a room early though. Our tour kept us out until after 10pm so we never were able to get in our room until late that evening. We booked a king oceanfront room - we splurged a little since we were on the last 2 nights of our honeymoon and all! We got a room on one of the corners of the 7th floor and what a beautiful view this was! This was a very busy hotel over a weekend and the beach was packed. We went to the beach once on Sunday afternoon but didn't spend any real time there. I think we enjoyed the view from our balcony more and could see all of the activity from there. It seems that a lot of local island families come to San Juan for the weekend because the hotel seemed full of locals (tourists too, but many locals on Sat and Sun). Our room was small, but adequate. It was clean and what I would expect from a Marriott resort hotel. This hotel does add on a \"resort fee\" and for this fee you receive 2 bottles of water per day, free WiFi, coffee/tea in your room, some casino match play coupons and live entertainment downstairs in the evenings. Not much, but the WiFi and the water was a nice touch. We prepaid on Expedia for everything in advance. The front desk and concierge service as well as the bell station were nothing but friendly and accommodating for our entire stay. We got some recommendations for dinner and they pointed us to the Walgreens at the corner so we could buy some snacks and water without paying hotel prices. A high recommendation for Kayak Puerto Rico - we took the combination Rainforest & Bio Bay tour. They need a minimum of 4 people to do this tour, but what an amazing tour! I believe you can find them here on TripAdvisor as well. We were lucky to have seen the Bio Bay without any real moon, so it was nice and dark that evening and I will say first-hand that it is very cool to see. El Yunque is a worthwhile trip for all - a definite must do. If you are willing to drop a good amount of money on a Marriot resort hotel, this is a good place to do it.

Starbucks across the street and Walgreens and Dunkin Donuts down the block. I woke up to get a simple breakfast across the street and brought it back to the room for the family (avg breakfast for all four of us was about $15) This is compared to the hotel breakfast buffet $20/person - Lots of resturants within walking distance ranging in cuisine and expense - Charlies Car rental across the street - we ended up just renting by the day and returning at night, so we did not incur hotel parking charges. - loved having a mini-fridge in the room, room safe and two waters/day Things were not crazy about: - if we had to pay for this hotel, it is way to expensive for everything. But at least there are alternatives for all meals off-site - concierge was functional, but had to work at getting help from them. would have like if they could offer more advice proactively. - check-in took 30 minutes as they searched for a room for us at 5pm.

The Marriot has a better lobby, better pool, better staff, better restaurant and a better location in Condado right on the beach.

My parents were on the 4th floor directly below us. They also had a nice view, but the ocean view was obscured by the palm trees. If a true ocean view is important to you, stay on the 6th floor or above. The rooms were very nice, with an updated d\u00c3\u00a9cor, nice bathroom and plenty of space. The pool area was attractive and there was a small waterslide that the kids enjoyed. We ate an adequate buffet breakfast in the restaurant. The concierge was also adequate. The Condado area is nice for a pre-cruise stay; but keep in mind that San Juan is a major metropolitan area that just happens to be on the beach. In a way it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very similar to Chicago\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location on Lake Michigan. Many of the reviews here seem disappointed with the Marriot because the reviewer was looking for a tropical island experience. I love San Juan and I enjoy staying in the Condado area, pre-cruise, but it is a city location, it is not a tropical island experience.

We also upgraded for the use of the concierge lounge for an additional ($50 +23%). Both upgrades were worthwhile. The 'junior' suite was very large, with a large ocean front balcony and separate bedroom, and combination living area and dining room table. The kids did have to share a sofa bed though.. the hotel wanted 40 a night for a roll away bed(seemed obscene!) and then told us that there wasn't enough room in our massive suite for a roll away due to fire regulation.

One other big customer service issue we has was related to laundry. When we arrived on the morning of our first day we immediately sent out a few shirts. Housekeeping came and picked up the shirts from me immediately. At the end of the follwing day we had not recieving the laundry back, so I called the front desk to enquire. The checked with the laundry manager and phoned me back to tell me that 'you just dropped off the laundry today', and proceeded to argue with me - like I wouldn't remember what day I dropped it off! I thought it was pretty standard understanding that you do not argue with guests - especially when money is not involved.

My husband and I were so looking forward to going to PR for a few days, without the kids and the COLD...we decided on PR because my husband has never been. My last trip to PR was about 15 years ago and stayed in Dorado Beach at the Hyatt.....wonderful time. We chose Marriott because my husband is an Elite Member and it was free, except for the $75 room upgrade per night, which we were aware of , and the upper floor corner ocean view room is well worth it. The first people you encounter when you arrive are the doormen, and they are wonderful. Very friendly and willing to answet any questions you may have, UNLIKE the unhappy ladies behind the concierge desk. I almost felt as if I was annoying them or something by asking a few simple questions, its not like I was asking for the historical background of Ponce De Leon. It was very hard to get a \"good morning\" never mind a \"Thank You\".Now on to service....let me just say DO NOT waite until you are dying of thirst or starving for lunch to order something, regardless if you are at the pool or in one of the restaurants expect to waite at least 20 minutes for someone to take your order, and then another 20 minutes to receive it....blew my mind. Lastley, the reason behind my title.....our last night at the hotel we decided to have dinner at the hotel, Tuscany. I ordered a Bowtie pasta and LOBSTER dish, key word being LOBSTER, which cost about $35, and my husband chose the Lasagna. Our waiter, Ricardo, was terrible....we later found out it was only his second day, and it showed. We ordered no appetizers, just dinner and it took easily 45 minutes to an hour to get it, and the place was empty. While eating my dish, which was very good I realized that I was eating SHRIMP and NOT LOBSTER, and I giggled about it for a few minutes and thought I was going nuts. My husband proceeded to call over Ricardo and tell him that the food was very good, but that it was shrimp and not lobster, he look liked he could die. Not knowing what to do next, he calls over another waiter and tells him the problem, and this one tried to assure me that it IS lobster, but I stopped him mid sentence and said I swear on my childrens lives that there is no way that its lobster, he said let me go and talk to the chef. After a few minutes he reemerged from the kitchen and had a message for me from the Chef....\"Ms our lobster is not from the Caribbean, we flew it in from somewhere else\" and that when my husband spit his wine all over the place in laughter and I the poor waiter must have realized what an idiot he just made of himself he walked away in shame. After a few more minutes , he came back to the table and apologized and said he will take ot off the bill....I took that as \"Yeah its SHRIMP\". Now, I dont know wether they ran out of Lobster that night, as it was late, or if they try to swap out the lobster for the shrimp on unsuspecting diners......either way I lost total respect for the Chef of Tuscany. If you can deal with slow service, unfriendly attitudes by some, and out right deceit, than I say go for it.

The entire staff (front desk, bar, outside bars, restaurants, and housekeeping) was very friendly, helpful and always happy to assist. Even the Hertz desk, not related to the hotel, could not have been more helpful. Getting to Old San Juan was a short cab ride for $14 or by a bus at .75 per person. The bus can take a while, though. Getting to the Isla Verde area is also around $15+- by cab as well as the airport. Everything in San Juan seems to be 10-15 minutes away from this area. The beach is great and with a staff to take your food/drink orders all day. By the time the sun begins to disappear behind the building, most of the beach slows anyway. You can get a great deal of sun most of the day. I don't understand the complaining in the other reviews. The waves are big, but goodness, you are staring at the Atlantic ocean...what do you expect?!?!! Use your judgement, I had friends swimming in it during red flags, and some that did not. The pools are not cold and not bath water, either. I'm thinking some of these reviews expect bath water! The lobby does get loud in the evening and each night has a different theme. We hit different hotel bars/lounges each night we were there. Each are very different. This one was slow for us, but enjoyable as we started each night here. La Concha felt more like a Miami lounge...the staff there is just as friendly and helpful. We traveled to the El San Juan by cab. It is a younger, very hip, very place to be seen crowd. There is a club in one area or stay in the lobby for the salsa sounds. It was just as crowded in the lobby and the bar is just as tasty. Lots of people watching in all the places we visited each night. There is great food within walking distance from the Marriott. There are a few places directly across the street, too. We used the car rental stand next door to the Starbucks (directly across from the hotel) since Hertz did not have any cars left and also suggested it to us. It turned out to cost us less and returning it that night, they gave us access back to their lot so as to not pay for parking at the Marriott and turned in the keys the next morning at no extra costs. We drove to El Yunque and Fajardo for the bio-bay. One warning, the bio-bay is not open to all kayak companies each day. Call ahead to your kayak company of choice and schedule beforehand. We were lucky! All in all, this Marriott matched what one can expect from Marriott. Clean rooms, great service, friendly staff. This is in a great location to get to/from most all areas of San Juan.

Loved it! First, the beds are the same, reliable, comfy beds that all Marriotts are famous for. The ocean is the same breathtaking turqoise blue as the water in the Bahamas. The hotel itself must have gotten a face lift recently because it is beautiful inside and out. Because Puerto Rico is a US territory, you can drink the water, they use American dollars, and most everyone speaks English. This hotel is situated on a convenient street that has two Walgreens (one in each direction, within easy walking distance), many restaurants to choose from, and a grocery store 2 blocks to the left as you exit the hotel. We never needed a cab or a rental car, as we decided just to lie around and take it easy, and stay in the immediate area. You can go whale-watching at the Rincon lighthouse, and to Old San Juan (just a short bus ride away), and to the rainforest if you want some more adventure. The staff is very professional and courteous. Amazingly so! And we felt very safe there. The best part... totally smoke-free! Even in the casino. And if you like high end shopping, they have Cartier, Louis Vuitton, etc within walking distance to the right as you exit the hotel. Things to be aware of: 1-Try not to stay on the lower floors during the weekend as the band is very loud, but it's fun to watch the locals dancing the salsa and meringue. 2-The ocean is too rough to swim in unless you have a boogie board. Hard to even wade in. Perfect for looking at. Splurge and get an ocean view room. 3- Yes the resort fee is hefty, but you can decline it if you don't want to check emails, or sit on a comfy lounge chair on the beach, or park a rental car. 4-This is a city on the ocean, so be careful when crossing in the middle of the street. They drive aggressively there. 5 There are some homeless people in the city, but they seem harmless. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel!

The hotel was 15 minutes from the Airport, and was convenient, and located on a beautiful piece of the Condado Beach. We had 2 rooms (called ahead from the US to ensure we would have a connecting door to our kids room), with a city view. Would have been nice to have the Ocean or Pool view, but it was a packed week, and we used Marriott points for 1 of the 2 rooms. At $266 a night before taxes and fees, it was still pricy to pay for the 1 room, but we needed the space! ROOMS: Rooms were pretty spacious, and we had a pullout chair (converted into a single bed) that we moved into the kids room to have 3 sleeping beds in one room, and my wife and I with the King bed in the connecting room. The rooms were clean, and pretty \"vanilla\" (not much style to speak of), but we didnt spend a whole lot of time in the rooms. Very comfortable beds to sleep in, and even though our rooms were directly across from the elevators, we never heard the people get on and off the entire week (rooms are surprisingly well insulated against sound). STAFF: The staff was extremely pleasant the entire week, although we did see a shift on the weekend, as the staff seemed overwhelmed on Saturday (when the place was packed, and the music was blaring in the lobby, and the only time we had to fight for chairs by the pool). There is always room for chairs on the beach, but as others have mentioned, it is true that the hotel towers block the sun by the pool, so you may need to shift chairs if you are looking to tan by the pools. POOLS: There are 2 pools - 1 is a 2-foot kiddie pool which my youngest (4 years old) lived in the entire week - first time we were able to sit on the side and watch without having to be in the pool or fear the water was too deep. However, a lifeguard on duty would have been a nice addition! The second pool never got more than about 4.5 feet deep, and had a fun slide the kids enjoyed, and lots of open area and a \"swim up bar\" for drinks. The pools were unfortunately a little too cold for my taste (again, the shade from the towers kept it cooler), and I was surprised they were not heated - my one wish for the pool area that should get to the corporate office wish list BEACH: The \"red flag\" was out the entire week, but I believe it is ALWAYS out (must be a liability issue). One day, the waves were VERY calm, and my 2 oldest (12 and 10) were able to boogie board without a problem. One day, the waves were so rough the only ones in the water were surfers. Aside from that day, we were always able to go in at least to ride or jump waves - use your judgement. Very clean beach, combed by a tractor each morning. RESORT FEES: Biggest tip - tell them at check-in you want to \"waive the resort fee\". At $33 a day, we saved about $200 per room ($400 total for our vacation) by doing this. What do you get for the resort fee? You can check for yourself, but the only item we did NOT get free with our room anyway that appeared on the resort fee list was the $12 umbrella setup on the beach. The 4 days we had our chairs setup for us on the beach, I paid the man who brought out the chairs (which are free) and umbrella $15 cash, so layout the money for the umbrella, and avoid that fee! AREA: We did not find the Condado area \"run down\", but there was construction a few buildings down the street (probably more hotels). There is a Walgreens 2 streets down, and we stocked up on snacks and water (anything you can purchase in the hotel is half the price at Walgreens!). There were a few good restaurants (see next section), and my kids liked the Haagen Dazs across the street, and the Piu Bella gelato place a few doors down. FOOD: The hotel buffet breakfast was fantastic - while $20 per adult is a bit pricy, it was half-price for kids, and free for under 5 years old, so we thought it was worth it. We tried Danny's for breakfast, but found the service VERY slow, the food not so good, and it was still $40 (and you couldnt get the kinds of fresh fruit and made-to-order omelettes and pancakes and waffles they had at the Marriott). We walked across the street to Camille's to get lunch almost every day (great salads, wraps, and pizza) - check it out as an alternative to the overpriced lunches at the hotel ($14 for a Quesedilla or burger). There are LOTS of great dinner places in Old San Juan, but if you are looking to stay local, we ate at Miros across the street (it was OK), but had a great dinner at the Argentinian Steak House - Ummo - and took a 15 minute walk one night to Aijillo Mojillo for some authentic Puerto Rican comfort food - beautiful place, and gave us an excuse to walk the area). DAY TRIPS: We went to El Yunque on the only rainy day we had (figured the rainforest made sense on that day), and thought of taking the tour - but at $59 and $69 per person, didnt seem to make sense to pay over $300 for the whole family. Instead, we rented a car from the Hertz desk in the hotel, drove at our leisure (not leaving at 7:30am when the trip left), and stopped at the information center where they have maps of the trails and sights. Had a nice day in the rain, and got back in the late afternoon - total cost was $65 for the entire day rental. Another great way to save a bundle! CASINO: Nice little casino - I visited each night, and there was always a spot at the craps table, and if you waited a few minutes, you could get a seat at one of the two $5 Blackjack tables. Saturday night was the only night that got extremely crowded (and they upped the minimum at the craps table to $10), and if you like slots, they seemed to have hundreds of machines - almost half the casino was slot machines! All in all, a very relaxing week, and the hotel is well suited for families. We have been at fancier \"resorts\" in the Marriott chain, but as long as you set your expectations for a clean, decent room, nice pools and great beach, and only 15 minutes from the airport (to the east) and 15 minutes to Old San Juan (to the west), you should be very happy.", "Date": "March 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Beach NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel for families with small children\u201d", "Author": "LongIslandFamilyGuy", "ReviewID": "UR25183242", "Content": "I agonized over which hotel to stay at for our trip to San Juan and I made the right choice.

Good restaurants in area include Ummo - good for meat lovers.

Old san juan can be reached by bus easily for 75 cents - be ready to wait a bit but good was fun for us. We went to el morro castle and also took the free trolley ride around town.

We took a tour to rain forest which was expensive - could be done easily if you rent a car and go there unescorted for less money but I really did not feel like driving so went for it.

My only complaint about the trip is that it rained a whole day on our last day and we only got one day that was total sunshine - other days were cloudy for most of the day.

We did have to move our spot over once or twice because the hotel towers got in the way of the sun, but the beach staff were eager to help you move your lounge chairs wherever you needed. The hotel's location was a pain; it's not really close to any real nightlife. We spent a lot of money taking cabs to other hotels/locations (El San Juan, La Concha, Old San Juan, La Placita, etc.) that had cool lounges and bars with people our age (early 30s). BUT the concierge people were great in recommending places for anything we requested (nightlife, restaurants, etc.). One in particular, Glendaly I think was her name (please give that girl a raise) was absolutely genius in planning out our weekend. She knew exactly what scene we were looking for and recommended places on certain days that were spot on. I was actually good enough to use the fitness center while staying there. It was very well equipped and I was able to get in some very full workouts. Although it would have been nice to have some scenery to look out at while sweating off my mojitos from our nightly romps. I also tried getting some work done using wireless internet access. First off, I was under the impression when I booked the room that the hotel provided free wi-fi. Nope I had to pay $15 for access each day. And I kept losing my signal. It got to the point where I got annoyed and wondered when in the heck I became so dependent on the internet anyway. All in all, this is a great hotel if you have a family (awesome kiddie pool) and aren't into the whole trendy modern chic decor of some other nearby hotels. The nightlife there is for an older, more classic crowd than what we're used to (40s), but the staff is more than willing to guide you in the right direction for whatever your little tropical heart desires.... Oh and if you're into spooky stories....ask a local about the history of the hotel.

There was no one at the pool bar when we were there and the drinks are fairly expensive. I paid $15 for a Mojito and a diet coke which consisted mainly of ice. Apart from that issue we found the service good. When I asked for some milk for tea the next morning, someone was up to our room within minutes with a small pitcher for my husband.

The area it was in is filled with abandoned buildings, and there are numerous homeless people sleeping in doorways in the area. One of the locals told us not to worry about crime in the neighborhood, because the locals only shot and stabbed each other, and left tourists alone. Take that to mean what you will. We were in a corner room, so I will include pictures of the view from our room. Our room was large and clean, as was the remainder of the interior of the hotel. The pool area was nice, and well maintained. The staff was friendly and helpful. The cleanliness of the interior, and the staff are why I give the resort two stars instead of one. Now for the real problems: The bill for my stay was over $980 for two nights (the room was $370 per night for an ocean view, plus $15 to use the internet, and a 23% tax on the hotel bill) After reading the reviews here, I expected a pleasant stay. Instead, I found a hotel that did not have a functioning fire alarm system (the back up batteries were dead, and the system had a supervisory fault- I didn't even have to go looking for it, the panel is next to the elevators) and whose electricity went out for most of our second night. This electrical problem was only our hotel, as the surrounding buildings still had lights on. The power cycled on and off about every 20 minutes from 3:24 a.m. until about 5:00 a.m., and when it did, the fire alarm sounded for a few seconds (no doubt due to the dead batteries). We didn't sleep well at all because of this. When we checked out, the staff offered to discount our room $50, which still meant we paid over $450 per night, which is pretty steep for the quality of this hotel.

We arrived on a Friday night after midnight. We had a guaranteed king/2 double cityview with balcony. We are marriott members and requested a late check-in and room on a high floor prior to check-in. Entering at 1:30AM, the band was playing, people were dancing and, not being able to hear the receptionist, we yelled to her that we wanted a room on a higher floor and wanted to waive the resort fee. She said that the place was totally full and that our room was 301 and it was the only room left. Little did we know this is the WORST room in the entire hotel. Pehaps it's becuase we purchased the room through priceline or perhaps it's becuase we were the last people to check-in, i dono, but we got hosed. The band played till 3am and we were basically sleeping above the band, and could even hear the patrons clapping and laughing. I live in NYC and am used to loud streets and drunk people at night outside my bedroom, but I couldn't sleep a wink with this noise! I called the reception and the night staff person said he had no other room and that he couldn't guarantee anything but he'd request a room change. My husband was ready to fly back home at this point, and I was ready to forgo my money that I paid upfront through priceline and head to another hotel. Not being able to sleep, I was up at 6:30am to open the curtains and see a cement wall and tons of cigarettes that were dropped onto the rooftop that was our \"cityview\". There was NO balcony. After having to ask for a remote for the TV and a hairdryer (both missing from the room as well a missing chair) I was went to reception at 8:30am. Being nice, I requested a room change. The very nice receptionist offered me to look at another room which was only a few foors up, and with a really crappy cityview. After pondering, I thankfully asked if there was any way to pay for an upgrade. For $25 a night extra we got the most wonderful ocean view room. From then on, we were happy and our vacation finally became fun and worthwhile! Despite having to pay $25 for the room, I was very happy with it! It's too bad they didn't offer any type of reimbursement for our sleepless night, but I wasn't ready to start fighting...i paid up the extra $75 and bit my tounge and figured this is how it is...gone are the days of the customer always being right! So, our room on the 17th Floor was awsome. The pool and hot-tub were wonderful. The location is superb and I would definetely stay here again, if they can guarantee me a tower oceanview room like we had, it was wonderful!!!!!!! I must also add that the staff were great!

This was the 3rd time my wife and I had stayed here, but the first time we brought our children, ages 9 and 5. We just wanted to share with you our thoughts and feelings regarding our trip. Hands down this was the best vacation our family has taken. EVERYTHING about the resort and the staff was tremendous. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel right at home. Even though we arrived before official check-in, a room was ready for us by the time we had finished lunch pool-side at the La Isla Beach Bar. Our waitress Maria was great, friendly and warm. She recommended the Fish and Chips, and my wife loved them! The staff at La Vista Restaurant was tremendous. In particular, Luis Escobar, Sonny and Angel were attentive and friendly, which made spending the inflated resort pricing a bit easier to tolerate. While not big fans in general of buffets, the breakfast buffet here is EXCELLENT. Omelets, waffles, pancakes and eggs made to order, along with all the breakfast meats, breads, fruit you could ask for. The Activities staff was first class as well. While I don't have all the names, Rita, Rose, Edgardo, Richard and Noelia stood out during the week. They were great with the kids, and made the various organized activities enjoyable for our children. While the whole activity staff was great, I do need to specifically call out Rita. At one point, while my wife and I were pool-side, we suddenly saw that Rita was coming down the slide. Rita had been the slide attendant at the top of the slide, watching and regulating everybody as they went down. Now, she herself was on the way down. For a split second I found this amusing, but then I quickly understood why she was coming down..a young child had just gone down the slide, and was in distress. She had panicked when she hit the water and was having trouble swimming. Rita did not hesitate, she was down the slide, fully clothed, shoes and all, in order to literally save that small child. It was amazing! The pool bar staff, Luis D, Carlos, Maria and the rest was also great! Our room was cleaned on schedule everyday. My wife commented that this was the best cleaned room we have had on any of our vacations. There was never a problem when we asked for extra towels or other items. The concierge and front desk staff was helpful and friendly. By the 4th day of the vacation, our children were saying that this trip was better than our Disney Vacation a couple of years ago. The only suggestion I would make concerns the Game Room. The game room needs a serious overhaul. It's in a dingy small room, with only a few video games, and if there are more than 4 people, it is difficult to walk around. Nothing about it makes you want to spend any time, and in turn money in it. We went in, and left pretty quickly. A pool/ping pong table and other items would go a long way here. Otherwise everything about this trip was beyond great. They even took my money at the casino with a smile! Couple items of note: The Hertz desk on site at the Marriott can't actually make a reservation for you. You need to call the 800#. Avoid the restaurant nearby named Buenos Aires. If you want Argentinian BBQ, then go to nearby UMMO! It was excellent! When going into Old San Juan you have to eat at Parrot Club. Avoid the quesadillas pool side: SO NOT worth the $14 charge. Do eat the Fish & Chips, Marriott Burger & Wings. For the kids, the chicken fingers were excellent. For a frozen treat for the kids, the chocolate smoothie was in their words AWESOME!.

Just tip the guy and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in.), Free local calls. (Most people have their own cell phones), 2 free small bottles of water in the room. (We bought a case of 12 oz water bottles at the Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s across the street for 3 bucks), one $5 coupon per day for 2 days of match play at the casino tables but you must bet $5. (I just dallied at the machines). You can refuse the resort fee at check-in. I did without any hassle to my vacation. To accentuate the rip off, the fee does NOT include free Marriott Internet service in your room using your own computer. They charge $14.95 per 12 hours for that! Not to worry. Just click on the network button in your control panel and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find other choices than the Marriott. Try the Nitro connection; it was excellent. I used my computer every day, whenever I wanted and never paid a penny. Right across the street is Miro restaurant, an excellent fish place that was so good we ate there twice. About 2 blocks to the left, as you exit the hotel is Ummo, an Argentinean steak place I found in these pages. It is excellent and fairly priced. I tried the skirt steak and it was tender and flavorful. Others in my party had the 1 lb. Porterhouse and said it was good too. We took a cab ($12 set fee) to Old San Juan. It is a charming place with many restaurants and shopping. We had dinner at The Parrot Club; fair prices and very good food. (Tip: ask the bell staff at the hotel how much is cab fare to wherever you are going. Once you know, confirm it with the cabbie to avoid being overcharged when you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make your deal beforehand.) Big Splurge: Pikayo Restaurant, about a 5 minute cab ride. Located in the Puerto Rican Museum of Modern Art, this beautiful restaurant is the best on the island. It offers a continental menu with some Puerto Rican specialties (the rice & beans were the best I've had) at New York prices. Service is superb as is the food. Tip: when they offer you specialties, ask how much? Most of the entres are $25-42 but specialties can run $80!!! The cheapest rental car place is right across the street in a little kiosk. Its called Charlie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rental Car. You can rent for a day or more for excellent prices. Get their website by googling them. There's a Starbucks across the street but i found a Dunkin' Donuts place about 3 blocks down to the right. There's also a Haagen Daz place across the street and we saved money each eve by not buying dessert at a restaurant and coming to this place for their great ice cream.

After some initial annoyances, we could not get into our room until 4:00 pm even though we had requested an early check-in for a 1:00 arrival and the hotel sought to charge us an exhorbitant daily rate for a roll away bed for our daughter (which they did agree to waive since we had no notification of these charges) we had a lovely stay. We booked a city view room at got a corner room with a king size bed (ending in 23) with 2 terraces, one overlooking the city and the other overlooking the ocean. The room was clean, bright and sunny and the housekeeping staff was excellent coming early in the morning and coming back promptly if you we were not ready for them. One night my daughter got sick in our bed around midnight and housekeeping was up in 3 minutes to completely replace our bedding (blankets and all) quickly and efficiently. The pool area is nice with a large wading pool for children about 4 years old and younger with a fountain in the middle and the deeper pool with a water slide. The water slide was open 11-4 most days which was ample time for my daughter to go down at least 25 times a day. The pool was not heated and I was very happy my daughter was occupied so I did not have to stand in the freezing water. The hot tub was nice seating about 8-10 people. Like many resorts with tall high-rises all of the chairs in the pool area are in the shade for at least half of the day. There was at least one activity every day for the kids by the towel stand (hula hoop contest or painting ceramics) which was a nice free activity around lunch. My daughter especially liked the cookie decorating around 2 pm. The beach was very nice. The water was very warm with a nice blue green carribean color. Although the red flag was up at the hotel every day we were there, we were able to wade in a few feet and not be bothered by the waves. The sand on the beach was clean and because of the ample shade you did not have to rent umbrellas (chairs were provided by the hotel for free). The hotel had pails and shovels for the kids to borrow along with some board games. We only had breakfast in the hotel once and it was your typical large Marriot buffet, it was nice to sit outside in a screened in dining area and look out at the ocean. We usually had breakfast at Danny's down the block who made excellent pancakes and eggs for breakfast and pizza for lunch and dinner. We also enjoyed the Chinese/Japanese restaurant in the hotel which has upscale Chinese food, a sushi bar and hibatchi tables. There is plenty of fast food within walking distance, Starbucks, Haagen Daz and a gelato store (Pia Bella) directly across the street and Dunkin Donuts, Baskin Robbins, Subway and Wendys within 3 blocks. There is a significant homeless problem in the area and it was not unusal to see a half a dozen homeless people sitting on the streets with cups out in front of stores. None of them were intrusive or menacing.

Very nice selection of cheeses and crackers plus a bottle of good wine. The price even with the surcharges seemed less to me than we could have bought all the items ourselves. Very nice indeed! 2) The room was clean with a nice balcony and beautiful view. We did have to wait a while for the elevators but oh well. Housekeeping was plentiful and very attentive to our needs. 3) The beach was nice - lounge chairs were set out for us immediately without us asking. Servers were plentiful. The surf itself was pretty rough but we found that it was more manageable a short walk down the beach toward the Rennassaince. Still to rough to snorkel though. Our only compalint was the crowded pools and broken hot tub.4) We don't really gamble but had some fun playing in the casino and everyone was very helpful. 5) The area where the hotel is seems to be making a comeback. Still some seedy spots mixed with really nice areas. We walked around alot and felt safe with just two of us. We did however make sure to avoid dark walkways and stay on the main strip at night.. Old San Juan was a short cab ride away and where we spent most of our time. We felt completely safe day and night in old San Juan exploring many nooks and crannies.

The property is in great shape and is nicer than most Marriott properties that I have been at in the continental United States. The room was not huge, but there was plenty of room with the king bed, chair and small table. Also, the hotel had ample closet and storage space for a long vacation. The only thing that kept me from making this a '5-star' review was some of the noise that we experienced. When we checked in, we were offered a room on the 17th floor with two double beds or one on the fifth with a king bed. We chose the lower and were at first very satisfied (we don't care too much about the view). The problem came on Friday and Saturday night when there was live music from the lobby bar. Even though we were on the fifth floor, it carried clearly up to our room. On Saturday night, the band was scheduled to play until 3 a.m., and the noise was loud enough that it kept us awake. This would not be enough to dissuade me from staying here again, but I would definitely for a room on a higher floor. We spent hours on the beach in front of the hotel each day, although we did not go into the water too much. The temperature of the water was great (in the 80s during December), but it was rougher than we expected. The waves were no different than what you see on a typical Mid-Atlantic beach in New Jersey, Delaware or Maryland, but it was not what we though it would be when compared to many other destinations in the Caribbean. The hotel has staff available to bring out beach chairs (comfortable), but you have to rent umbrellas for $12/day. We ended up not paying the rental fee because in December, the hotel and neighboring buildings provide a considerable amount of shade. We did not use the pool other than to stick our feet in, but there were great lounge chairs, and the area was nice. One of the things that we did not care for about the resort was that we felt a bit nickel-and-dimed. A good example would be the umbrellas, but for the price that we paid for the room, I would have thought that some more would be included. We also requested a two-hour late checkout on our final day. I was told that even as a Marriott Rewards member, I would have to pay a charge of $25 of the daily rate to spend two additional hours. I've never encountered anything like this at other Marriott properties I've stayed at. We did not eat at the restaurants, nor did we have many drinks from the hotel bars. Everything was very expensive and did not seem worth the money at the hotel. The property is in a great location where you can walk short distances to many restaurants and cafes. There is also a Walgreens (out the front of the hotel and a block to the right) that we visited to buy some food for quick and easy breakfasts. While we spent most of our time at the resort, we went into Old San Juan for a day. The city has a great bus system that has a stop directly in front of the hotel (out the front door and about 200 feet to the right). I believe it was buses C53 and B21 that went to Old San Juan. While the buses do not run as frequently as in major U.S. cities, we did not have a terrible wait to and from Old San Juan. The bus was not overcrowded and seemed very safe and clean... and free! All, in all, this was a very good property and certainly is up to Marriott standards.

We thought it was a nice place, probably the nicest in San Juan and liked the location. The taxis in San Juan are fairly safe and easy to work with, they are called Taxi Touristico and have set prices. It was about a 20 min drive from the airport and cost us about $15 to get there. Check in was easy and our room was ready. They offered us a different room in the newer tower for $25 more but we saw our booked room and liked the view and found both to be about the same so we stayed with the original room. The rooms are clean, well-decorated and we had a wonderful view of the ocean from the 19th floor. I am really picky about the bathroom and found that the bathroom was really spotless! Nice toiletries from Bath and Body Works, granite countertops and white tubs without any mold or mildew, and very spacious. The room also had an iron and an umbrella which comes in handy in a place like San Juan. We loved the soft beds and pillows. The maid service was also good and had our room cleaned in a timely manner. We used the pools and jacuzzi which had just been fixed. The pools are a little shady and cool but that was our only option since the waves are rough on the beach. It is a very nice beach to take a walk but would not recommend for swimming with young families. Also the waterslide at the pool is only open at certain times. We heard that Luquillo beach near the rainforest is nice but could not make it there due to the short duration of our trip. We did use the gym at the hotel which was very clean and up to date. They have nice cool towels to wipe down with after your workout and have water and teas to drink. The only downside is you can only use the treadmill for 30 min before it starts to shut down. I think they are programmed this way. We did not have any problems with noise from the lobby or hallways at night. We did not use the casino much as this was not our interest. The weather was gorgeous and we preferred to be out. We did not eat at the hotel because it was overpriced and there are so many options just outside this hotel. Starbucks and Hagen-Daas is right across the street as well as a sandwich shop and a taco chain. Down the street on the right there is Tiajuana's which is a Mexican chain and Danny's International which is a nice italian restaurant with awesome pizza. There are lots more restaurants if you keep walking but we did not need to. Danny's also served up a good breakfast. On the left is Walgreen's which sells everything you might ever need. We brought some cereals from home and just went and bought milk from Walgreen's and put it in the fridge in our room so that we didn't have to run out in case the kids wanted breakfast or a snack. There is also a grocery store in walking distance on the right of the hotel. The bus stop is just outside the hotel and buses are free until Jan. You take C10, B21 or C53 to Old San Juan. From there you catch the green tourist bus or the open trolley bus (still free) and can go through Old San Juan and even to the two forts. Lots of restaurants in Old San Juan and shopping. Near the Sheraton at the pier there are lots of tents with street vendors if you like that type of market. We went to El Morro Fort which is worth seeing. Costs $3 per adult to enter and you can walk through it in about 30 min. It was no problem for the kids to walk through it. Check out from the hotel is at noon. They let us extend to 1 pm which was fine for us because we went to the pier after check out. It cost about $12 and was about 10 min away. We called for the Bellman to take our luggage on the way out but he never showed up so we just walked down with our luggage and saved ourselves $5! The only other problem we had was a charge on our bill for use of Games on the TV which we had to call the front desk to remove THREE times and they finally did on check out. It was not a big problem, just an annoyance because each time we called they said they would take care of it and never did. They do charge you a \"resort fee\" of $12 per day but that is just one of the things you have to pay if you stay at this place.

We paid more for ocean-view and it was well-worth it because we spent a good deal of time on the balcony. The room was well-appointed with pretty art and a large flat screen television.

I don't fault the system -- this is the Caribbean and I have stayed in other hotels where the ac needs time to get rid of the humidity.

This was off-season so I cannot comment on the usage. Bar personnel did patrol both the pool and the beach. Staff on this property was helpful and friendly. The hot tub was under repair -- boarded over, so it was difficult to tell if and when it will return to use.

We also got to see and swim in one of the top 10 best beaches in the world. It was breathtaking. I highly recommend this excursion. The hotel was another story. The hotel is very nice and the room was clean, staff was somewhat friendly. The lady at the information desk (how to get to Old San Juan) was very matter of fact and probably wasn't having a good day. The hot tub was not working and that was very disappointing. We were there for 5 days and it was out of service the entire time. I will say the kid's pool was nice and the slide was great for the kids. It was nice being on the beach, the tide was rough but it was very convenient to be steps away from the beach. The price of food and drinks were overpriced. $13.00 for a hamburger and $10 for an alcohlic drink, $4.00 for a USA Today newspaper.

We had a full view of the pool area and a partial view of the ocean.

We considered moving to another room, but by the second day we were used to the noise and didn't notice it anymore. The hotel has 2 restaurants: La Vista, a casual cafe; and Tuscany, a high-end Italian restaurant. There are several excellent restaurants within an easy walk of the Marriott, and numerous dining choices in OSJ. Food in San Juan tends to be expensive, but it's almost always cheaper to dine outside of the hotel. For a quick, inexpensive breakfast, there's a coffee bar in the hotel lobby, and a Starbucks directly across the street. The bus to Old San Juan stops at the end of the block that the Marriott is on, and takes about 20 minutes to reach Old SJ. The usual bus fare is 75 cents, but all buses were free when we were there.

We checked into the Marriott the evening of Saturday August 16 after staying at another hotel in the Condado Area the day before but due to an unforseen situation that was taking place at that other hotel we decided that the best thing to due was for us to come back and stay at the San Juan Marriott Resort an Stellaris Casino. I took a walk to the Marriott and as soon as I enter the Hotel I knew I was in heaven again. I went directly to the check in counter and asked for high floor,ocean view room with two beds. I was told that they did not have either an ocean view or pool view room with double beds but that they will be able to give me a City view room with two beds on a high floor. Since it was more important to me to have a room with two beds because I was traveling with my 12 year old daughter and my Girlfriend I opted to accept the City View Room. I was given room 1025 which had a very nice view of the Condado Area right in front of the hotel entrance facing the main Ahsford Avenue. It was really nice watching the people jogging along Ashford Avenue every morning while seating on the terrace while drinking coffee and reading the newspaper which it was delivered free everyday to our room. Last year in October we stood in room 1107 facing the pool and the ocean and even though we did not have the same view this time I will like to comment about how clean these rooms are always kept. We were out of our rooms usually by 9:00am to go to the pool. The pool was never crowded the 9 days we were there. We always found chairs either facing the sun or in the shadow under the many palm trees surrounding the pool. There are two pools, one is a kiddie pool and the other on is the regular pool which I think the deepest part is 5 feet. There is a water slide that opens at 11:00am and the kids have a ball with it. I spent most of the time in the sun while my girlfriend and daughter spent much of the time in the water but it was wonderful seen kids and adults come down the slide. It is really a very relaxing atmosphere at the hotel's pool. Sometimes I will seat by the swim up bar to have a drink. The mojitos as well as the pina coladas were excellent and very refreshing specially when the temperature was always between 90-95 degrees every day we were there. One time when we were driving to the town of Ponce the temperature hit 102 degrees in the car's outside temperature gauge. Trust me this was not a malfuntion.It was actually that hot in Ponce that day. Now going back to the rooms. When we went up back to our rooms which it was around 12 or 1pm we always found that the rooms had been cleaned with plenty of fresh clean towels. The cleaning staff at the Marriott take pride when cleaning the rooms. Whenever you need anything they will bring it to you with a smile.There was only one incident where the room had not been clean and as soon as I placed a call to the front desk they sent someone up to clean it right awat after we left the room. The beds!!! Oh my God!! I have to say that these are the most comfotable beds I have ever slept in. I said it on my previous review written last year and I have to say it again. I have no idea what these beds have that makes them so special but when you get in them you just don't seem to want to get of them. The whole staff at this hotel are the friendliest that I have ever come across at any other hotel I have ever been to. They make you feel at home. They are always smiling and ask you from time to time if everything is fine with your stay. Eveytime we came back to the hotel with my car they always open all the doors and greeted us with a smile. At the hotel we usually had breakfast at la vista restaurant. It is true as many other reviwers stated that It can be expensive if you have children because even though there is a buffett they charge $11.95 for a child even if he/she has just 1 panckake. Since my 12 year old is not a breakfast person what we did was to go to Walgreens which is just half a block to the right of the hotel and we purchased milk , juice water and cereal and we took it to our room since most of the rooms have a small fridge and in the mornings my daughter will have cereal in the room while we were getting ready to go downstairs to have breakfast at La Vista Restaurant. For Dinner we went out of the hotel and tried different restaurants which are within a walking distance along Ashford Avenue. One of our favorites is \"Ropa Vieja\". It is a Cuban/Puerto Rican restaurant and their mojitos are excellent and their Mofongo stuff with Srimp is delicious. Just make a right outside the hotel and walk for about 10 minutes passing La Concha Hotel and the Vanderbilt Hotel which it is being remodeled. We tried \"Casa De Angel\" which it is also a Puerto Rican Food Restaurant and the food was not as good as we expected. I ordered fried Red Snapper which the waiter told me it was one of their best dishes an whn I got it it was burnt beyond recognition. My daughter ordered \"Pernil\" (roast pork shoulder)with rice and beans and the pork I could tell it was reheated. My girfriend ordered Baked Halibut and this fish was so salty and hard that she was drinking water all the way back to the hotel. In my opinion stay away from this restaurant. We also tried Ajili Mojili. Well Known in the island. This is also a typical Puerto Rican Restaurant. The food was just ok but not for the price that they charge. I just wan to make clear that I am a penny pincher. I do not mine spending money regardless how much it cost as long as the food is delicious but the food at this restaurant was just ok and not for the hype that it generates. To go to this restaurant just make a right outside the Marriott and walk for about 15 minutes and it will be on your left next to Chillis across the street from Rop Vieja.. Now at the old San Juan we wen to eat at the \"Parrot Club\". 363 Fortaleza Street.Now this has to be the best restaurant we ate while in Puerto Rico. The food was delicious!!!. It its located almost at the end of Fortaleza Street. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\" Second Best Restaurant we ate at was called \"Toro Salao\" (Salty Bull).Also in the old San Juan . It is located at the end of Fortaleza Street but the street that goes across. 367 Tetuan Street. The food was also delicious but their Mojitos were the best one I tried in all Puerto Rico. We also traveled outside the San Juan Metroplitan area to eat some of the Puerto Rican delicacies that you do not find near hotel in the tourist section. We drove to a town call Guavate to eat lechon asado (Roast Pork)and pasteles. This town is known for the many kioskos (little wooden tents/stores ) off the road where they start cooking the whole pork early hours in the morning and many other things like guineos and arroz con gandules freshly made every day. To go there you will have to drive to route 52 as if you were going to the town of Ponce but you will have to get of at exit 32 to Guavate. If you go there please go to lechonera Los Pinos. According to the locals that we asked they said that that is the best place to eat Lechon Asado (Roast Pork) and trust me they were RIGHT. That is the best lechon asado I have ever had. We had a wonderful time in Puerto Rico and most all we love the Marriott Hotel. Every time we come here we feel as if we were home. The whole staff treat us like familiy and I will not hesitate to come back here again. I know that no hotel can please everyone but if you read the many positive reviews about this wonderful hotel you know why so many people love this hotel. Personally I feel very strongly that besides staying at a hotel that it is beautiful and well kept the most important thing is how the staff treats you and makes you feel and this San Juan Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino exceeds my expectations when it comes to treating their guest and make them feel special. To the whole Staff at the Marriott Resort and Casino , Thank You So Much for Being So Nice To Us.

It was REALLY LOUD (although amazingly, we could not hear it in our room)- too loud to enjoy and dance at, which is too bad because we love salsa dancing. Just like everyone said, the food was super expensive and the drinks too- our first day we had our $13.00 hamburgers with $9.00 pina coladas, and that was enough. The good news is that the area is full of lots of restaurants and there's a Walgreen's down the street. We also found a liquor store and stocked up our own room and backpacks for the beach. The mojito mix was surprisingly decent, and the bottle of Bacardi was a whopping $5!!! The beach was lovely. There were plenty of waves, and a boogie board rental place on the beach next door. (Also, the lady sold DELICIOUS empanaditas for a snack) If you're looking for lapping little waves it isn't the beach for you, but the waves were fun for us to play in. The taxi trip downtown to Old San Juan (15 minutes in traffic) was a different price each time we rode. It ranged from $14 to $20, which we thought was a little pricey- and weird that the price fluctuated. No one goes out or eats there until very late on weekends- don't expect any nightlife until about 12 midnight. Best just find yourself a nice tapas bar and enjoy some sangria or a cafecito while you wait. We never found a restaurant that we didn't like.

The pool was decent, but I liked the one at the Intercontinental better as we staryed there our last time in PR. We didn't like that the kids water slide was only upon until 4PM. When we came to the hotel for our second stay we got a high ocean view room (1717) in the tower. The wrap around views were spectacular! That night however, the people in the room next to us decided to party all night, so we called security at 1AM and they came and quieted them down. We also called the front desk to ge the number of a local pizza joint we'd used earlier in the week and twice they gave us the number to the wrong restaurant, when we called the front deck the third time they didn't bother to pick up. The next morning we called for late check out and no one picked up the phone again. An hour later someone did pick up and part of our Marriott rewards benefit is \"priority late checkout\" where you pick the time and due to our late flight and having kids with us, we wanted to check out at 1PM. The desk said no one gets to check out past noon, only an hour later than normal, so this was an inconvenience. Overall, the rooms and hotel are nice.

Please note as a frequent Marriott guest their level 6 hotels are generally geared for the business trade. Not as fancy as a Ritz, etc., but at a fraction of the cost. Great place for kids. The beach was terrific. We wanted waves and we got them. Not the place if you are expecting miles of beach. Plenty of beach chairs available both on the beach and at the pool. Plenty of kids activities. Probably not a great choice for retirees. A great combination of a resort in a urban setting. Puerto Rico is not the destination for the budget visitor. However, we found the food to be excellent (especially for the Carribean). Not cheap so be prepared. Service was exceptional and everybody was amazingly friendly. The Casino was great and very casual. Most important lesson (after the first excursion) was to use mass transportation. We saw the forts, went shopping and visited the Baccardi factory on our own.

We checked in at about 3pm on August 15 after traveling from New York since 4:30AM. We were hungry and wanted to enjoy a nice Caribbean lunch in the hotel restaurant \"LA VISTA\". We were seated outside on the terrace as requested and ordered two delicious mojitos right away. Followed by this we got Ceviche as an appetizer and proceeded to order our main courses from a slim menu. I got the Cuban sandwich and my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e ordered a grilled Caribbean mango chicken sandwich. $70 later plus tip, I have to tell you how disappointing this food was. I really had higher expectations of a Marriott resort restaurant. The bread was not fresh and the sandwiches looked and tasted like they came out of a school cafeteria! We got engaged on the Beach outside the hotel the next day and went to dinner down the street at an Argentinean restaurant. I'm sure we would have, as we planned, eaten in the Marriott Tuscany restaurant for dinner that night. But we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.

The staff was always smiling, always attentive, and so very helpful. The food was well below the bar that I would expect of a Marriott Hotel / Resort.

My high expectations were not met for the following reasons. The day I was to fly out, I spoke with Anthony in at your service (hotel operator) to inquire if the wireless in guest room internet charge was included in the $29 a day resort fee that is charged on top of the room rate and tax. Anthony told me this internet charge was included. I arrived at the hotel around 2AM, and there was a band playing music in a dance club type atmosphere in the middle of what is supposed to be the hotel lobby, which was made up of a bunch of tables and chairs with a bar in the middle. I couldn't hear a thing because of the volume of the music, and there were no front desk employees at the front desk. After a few minutes, I tracked a hotel employee down, and was eventually checked into my room. Upon arriving at my guest room for the first time, I was greeted by a small amount of trash right in front of my guest room door in the hallway. After entering the guest room, I was happy to see that the room was clean and in good shape. The room I stayed in was recently renovated and had a very nice formal caribbean decor. The balcony was large for a standard guest room, and was extremely private, which blocked off a portion of our ocean front view, but the privacy was nice. After getting settled, I went to go on the internet, and the computer showed that I would be charged an additional $14.95 a day for internet access, so I called at your service again, and was told that I would not be charged the additional fee, because it was included in my resort fee. The next day we were out of the room the whole day until 6 or 7PM, and when we arrived at the room it was still dirty, because housekeeping had not come by to clean the room yet. I called at your service, and was told that housekeeping could only bring me towels at this time of the evening, and instead of arguing with this person, I asked to speak to a manager. I was put in contact with Miguel, who is a housekeeping manager. Miguel initially did not know why my room was not cleaned, but eventually told me that the maid got sick and went home early. Shortly after that conversation, my room was cleaned. On my way to the casino that night, I stopped by the front desk to speak to a manager to try to get some assurance that I would not have many more problems, because we were ready to switch to another hotel at that point. I spoke to a woman, who claimed to be a manager, and when I told her about the problems we had on our first day and that we were thinking about changing hotels instead of apologizing or addressing the problems, she offered to book us in another hotel. After I told her that I would think about whether we would stay or not, she gave me a \"I'm sorry\". I then proceeded to the casino in the hotel, and was previously told by a person at the front desk that no shorts or short sleeves were allowed to be worn in the casino at night, so I was in jeans and a button down shirt. After about an hour, I could not tolerate how hot I was in the casino, because the air conditioning is kept very low, so I left the casino and never returned during the entire trip. I believe it was the second night of our trip, and we went to La Vista, which I was told was the casual dinner restaurant of the hotel, and the food was very slow to come out even though there were only a hand full of people in the entire restaurant. I asked the waitress for the check, and she must have forgot, because we had to eventually get up and wait for her by the server's area to pay the check and leave. On our second to last night, we did not receive maid service again, but this time it was just turndown service we did not receive, so our bed was made and the room was clean, but we had no clean towels or shampoo that night and the next morning. Sure enough on our last day, we look at the bill and there were multiple internet charges on top of the resort fees. This time my girlfriend went down to the front desk to get the internet charges taken off the bill. Upon her return to the room, she told me she successfully had them take off the internet charges and that we were being treated to a complimentary breakfast by Marco, who was briefed on the details of our stay. I had a chance to meet and speak to Marco before we checked out, and he was very apologetic and was a pleasure to speak with. I have to say that when the maids cleaned our room they did an excellent job and were very nice when we encountered them. During our stay we spent a good amount of time eating and having drinks at the Marriott Renaissance, which is only a couple of blocks away. The Renaissance was booked up the night that the front desk manager offered to transfer me to another hotel, so we ended up staying at the Marriott. Anyway, we very much enjoyed our time at the Renaissance. The Renaissance is a much more chic and beautiful hotel. It has an art deco decor with lots of water features, colored lighting, and comfy white beds and couches all over the lobby and pool area. The Renaissance restaurants are excellent as well, and are not your typical Marriott restaurants. The service we experienced at the Renaissance when dining there was excellent. Although, we had a good time in Puerto Rico overall despite some problems, we would probably not go back to Puerto Rico again; However, if we did go back we would definitely try the Renaissance and stay away from the Marriott.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida, USA", "Title": "\u201cVery friendly and accommodating\u201d", "Author": "gimmecandynow", "ReviewID": "UR18827544", "Content": "We arrived at the hotel at 9:00am, and even though check-in is not until 4:00pm, they gave us our room, which was like getting a free day.

We stayed on the 9th floor and never heard a sound at night or in the morning when we were trying to sleep, which was great since I'm used to hearing doors banging, partiers, and children running the halls even in 5 star hotels. Also noteworthy is that at the time of our stay, the resort allowed guests to decline the 12% daily resort fee. I appreciated this since, like most resort fees, it adds no services that aren't already included in the price of the room. The hotel is within walking distance to many restaurants and shops, and the concierge is happy to give you a list.

The beach was well maintained and large, and there is an attendant there to help you with chairs and umbrellas. They chared $12 to rent an umbrella, but there were plenty of shady palm trees to sit under as well.

OVERALL: The room was a good size and it was worth every penny to pay a little extra for the pool/ocean view... it was great to sit out on the balcony with a cold drink and look out at the pool area and (beyond the pool area) the gorgeous clear blue ocean! The room stayed kind of damp/humid all week, but I think some of that may be inevitable given the Caribbean climate! The location was good too. Nice beach, especially if you like playing in the waves (not super calm water, but that was a good thing for us!). Money-Saving Tip for Drinkers: The drinks at the pool area were definitely overpriced, so we decided to buy our own little bottle of rum and some juice, etc mixers at one of the many little grocery/liquer stores within walking distance. (For about $20 worth of \"stocking the bar\" in our room, we were able to get the amount of drinks that would have cost $200 at the bar over the course of the week!). If you are interested in touring the Bacardi Rum factory, don't book your trip through the tour company in the hotel.... they will likely charge you around $50 per person, and in reality you can get there and have that entire experience for less than $30 total. Overall this was a good afternoon, but we were so glad we hadn't spent $100 to have the tour company take us there! We did book a trip to hike in El Yunque through the tour desk at the hotel, and that turned out to be a very good choice! We never would have been able to pick out the most scenic spot to go hiking had we chosen to rent a car, drive there ourselves, etc... plus it was nice to not have to worry about transportation (it's about 45 mins away). We ate at the Tuscany restaurant in the hotel one night, and the food was very good. We also managed to find lots of great little restaurants to try within walking distance, and it was fun to just wander around until we saw a place that looked like a good one to try!

Puerto Ricans are a very friendly people in general and this shows, always asking if everything was ok and always greeting you with a friendly smile. I had a corner room (#1609) overlooking the ocean and pool/Old San Juan. The corner rooms have a wrap around terrace in which easily you could entertain over 10 people. they have chairs and a table so you can watch the spectacular sunsets from your terrace while enjoying a drink or simply relaxing. The business lounge at the 21st floor is very nice also, they have appetizers from 5-730pm (Sunday-Thursday) which can easily serve as a meal. In the morning they also have breakfast which I found more than adequate. There's an automatic coffee machine also which makes excellent espresso. The beach: perfect also. Included in the price is a \"resort fee\" which allows you to use the hotel beach chairs and umbrellas. So you only have to tell the attendant at the beach where you want your chair and umbrella and thats it, no $$ involved. Most of the time I was there the beach was half empty but on weekends you find more locals that stay at the hotel and can be more crowded but never too crowded. There are a few hotels nearby that you may be considering also. The closest one is \"La Concha\", it's the building with the big white building that looks like a clam schell (concha) in my pics. It's 2 blocks from the Marriot and was recently renovated, the lobby looks great, very chic, but the beach area is small and it's right next to a park so not very private and looked more crowded. Others in the area are the Condado Beach, but has a very very tiny beach. The Caribe Hilton has nice public facilities and nice beach but far from everything if you want to walk. The Ashford Ave. is like the Rodeo Drive of San Juan, with Cartier, Louis Vuitton, etc stores all around it. Very safe also. The bed was very comfortable, the AC worked fine and the room was always clean. Same with the bathroom. Ate at the restaurant once and was good, there are so many good restaurants around the hotel that it's hard to choose. At night there is a live band playing in a stage in the Lobby floor, it was packed with locals dancing every single night. There's also a bar at the Lobby and of course the casino, not a casino person so no opinion on it.

After researching a lot of properties, I chose this one. I am a very picky person so I am always worried about spending a lot of money and not getting what I paid for. This hotel met all of my expectations. Great staff.. everyone said hello and was helpful. We stayed in an oceanfront room on the 15th floor, which was breathtaking (be sure to make sure you are in the main tower and not in the cabana.. especially if you pay for the oceanfront room). The room was very clean, nicely decorated, and had a very private balcony. The bathroom was nice.. but a little small. They offered two pools. One was only 2 ft in depth, and they other was about 4ft. They had a neat water slide that provided entertainment for both kids and adults. I even saw some senior citizens using it.. which I thought was great! They have two pool bars and have happy hours specials. Make sure to get your two-for-one drinks during happy hour. The casino and the live bands were a nice touch. We enjoyed drinks while listening to the music. Some suggestions: 1. You can opt-out of the resort fee. We saved about $27 per day by opting out. The only thing we missed was the internet access.. which was great for me b/c I wouldn't be addicted to checking my e-mail for 5 days. Just ask the person checking you in to opt out. You will still get your towle service at the pool. 2. If you want to rent a car, rent one through Hertz. They have a counter right in the lobby. We were able to drop the car off in the hotel's parking garage after hours when we were done with the car. It was convienient. 3. We chose a room rate that included access to the executive lounge. We had breakfast in the lounge, appetizers, and desserts for three of our days and the food was great. Just be advised that the lounge operates Sunday night through Friday, so if you are coming for the weekend.. don't bother. 4. There are great restarants right around the hotel. We had a decent breakfast as well as great pizza (and I am orignially from NY!) at Danny's International restaurant (one block exiting the hotel to the left), a nice dinner (authentic Puerto Rican food) at Ajili Mojili which was about a 15 minute walk to the right of the hotel. We also grabbed lunch from Camille's Cafe and had a nice seafood dinner at Miro, which are directly across the street from the hotel. Just be careful of walking into a sidewalk restaurant. We got sucked into one, and wound up paying $35 for lunch! At least the food was decent. Just check the menu prices. 5. If you visit the Rain Forest, don't pay all the money for a guided tour. Once the guy in the visitor center explained the trails to us, it was very easy to follow. The hike down to the bog waterfall is not for your 80 year old grandma, but worth the effort once you get down there. I was upset that I didn't have my swimsuit on. I definitely wanted to jump in with everyone else after our hike down there. 6. Try to book excursions on your own instead of going through the hotel. You will save about $20 doing it on your own. We enjoyed the snorkeling catamaran cruise through the East Wind company. They even picked us up at our hotel. That was about 5 hours in length.. with and open bar available for the entire duration. We also went on the bioluminescent kayaking trip. We went at 6:30, which turned out to be great. We could see through the lagoon on the way out and it was dark by the time we got to the area that contained the bioluminescence. The trip back wasn't as fun b/c it was dark and people we crashing into each other. 7. We took the bus into Old San Juan.

They tend to cater more to Singles or Honeymooners. The Marriott San Juan Resort & Stellaris is definitely \"Family\" friendly. I was there with my 3 & 6 year olds. They absouletely loved the resort. Their favorite part (and mommy's) was the huge Children's Pool. Usually when I travel, the hotel's Children's Pool is so small you find yourself fighting with other parents to get a spot for your kid. But, this Resort's Children Pool is huge! So Moms/Dads, no worries. The Children's pool is also divided off from the deeper pool, where of course, the older kids and adults hang out. If you're like me, I'm always worried the younger kids will be harmed when the older kids are in the same pool. Again, not a problem here. The resort also has sand buckets, shovels, boardgames etc. for the kids to borrow for free. They're located at the towel hut. They also have books mom and dad can borrow, if you want to lay back and read. It's true that the beach has dangerous waves for young children. But, my kids were content making sand castles and staying on the edge of the water when they wanted to get wet. There is a Starbucks and Hagen Dazz right across the street. And a Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robbins 2 blocks away. My kids of course loved getting donuts for breakfast and Mom and Dad loved the affordable breakfast. There is also a Wendy's and Chili's not too far away. You can definitely walked there and back (not dangerous). The rooms are beautiful. We stayed in the tower (15th floor) and had the city view. It was just fine for a family. Anyone with kids knows that an Ocean View room is lost on kids. They don't want to see the beach, they want to play on the beach. So save yourselfs some $ and booked the city view rooms that are on the higher floors. Nice view of the city at night. Another nice perk, the local bus is down the block. So with .75cents you can get to downtown San Juan. My kids loved the adventure of riding the local bus. There were many tourist on the bus, so you'll fit right in and feel safe. If its raining out, take a look in your room closet, there's a huge umbrella you can borrow. There's also cozy robes and slippers (for adults) Mom and Dad can slip into later. If you're wondering what the Resort has for Adults? It has Plenty!!. The deeper pool with a Slide, the Swim up bar. The Salsa band each night. The great Bar and Casino and Restaurants. The staff there were so so nice and professional too. That of course is a big plus. You can't go wrong at the Marriott San Juan Resort and Stellaris Casino. We had a great time and hope to stay again during our next visit (hopefully next year).", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DC Suburbs", "Title": "\u201cGreat Overnight Stay\u201d", "Author": "GLBTCruiser9", "ReviewID": "UR17209044", "Content": "This was the third time we stayed at the Marriott Stella Solaris.

We couldn't have been more pleased with the Marriott. First of all, the location is fantastic. The Condado district is just 10 minutes from the airport, and 10 minutes from Old San Juan.

There is also a small grocery store/liquor store and a Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s within a block or two. The hotel itself was very comfortable. The room was large and comfortable. It looks like it had been recently renovated. Very comfortable bed, granite counters in the bathroom, small refrigerator, and a large plasma TV with about 30 US satellite TV stations. The in-room wireless internet was as fast as back home. The pool area was very nice, and well maintained. There was never a problem getting a chair by the pool. The beach was beautiful. It was very easy to get beach chairs and an umbrella. Even though the waves were a bit rough, there were plenty of people swimming in the ocean. The bars in the pool areas were great. Never a problem getting a drink, and made a wide variety of tropical cocktails. We ate at the La Vista restaurant for breakfast. They had an $18 breakfast buffet option, that was very good. Made to order omelets, Belgian waffles, fresh fruit, pastries, OJ, very good coffee. There were so many other dining options surrounding the hotel, why bother eating at the hotel for lunch or dinner. The casino was very good. It was open 24 hours a day. They had about 10 blackjack tables. Several at the $5 and $10 level. With good blackjack rules (dealer stands on soft 17). They also had a $5 craps table. Sign up for their player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s club when you get there. We earned about $75 in food comps, just by playing a couple of hours a day.

We were given a room high up as requested, and the view from the 14th floor was breathtaking, from the city, the beach and the ocean. The pool is very good although somewhat shady. However the beach is right there if you want a lot of sun. The customer service is excellent, even the maids smile and appear happy as they work. They pay a lot of attention to detail all the time, one of the employees called the elevator when he saw us walking in that direction. Also, the location is very good for several reasons, the bus stop to go to Old San Juan was really close (bus B21), there was a Walgreen's as you walk to the right of the hotel, a couple of blocks beyond a mini supermarket. If you like dancing it's ideal, they have different live bands from Weds until Sunday and their mojitos are delicious. There are several restaurants very close, the one right in front of the hotel is Miro, it is Catalan (from Spain) and even though the outside looked somewhat gaudy on Saturday night (with loud band and extra lights) had really good food, great service and pleasant seating inside. And if you walk to the left or to the right you will find several restaurants not very expensive. At the hotel we tried the restaurant La Isla, by the pool and their sandwiches were very decent. However we tried the restaurant La Vista (bottom of hotel) and were very disappointed. I had black beans soup that was very salty and my husband Cesar salad with grilled chicken, the salad very acidic and the chicken was lukewarm and tough, I would not recommend it. Also if you are interested in renting a car you can get one in the hotel (expensive) or call Target Rental, a local office and they will come to pick you up, to the hotel or the airport, very reasonable prices and great service. (We rented a compact for $30 a day) But check with your insurance company and make sure you are covered in Puerto Rico. We went to el Yunque, it was very easy to get to and very interesting.

We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants as pricey. We did eat the hot dogs ($6) and hamburgers ($12) from the hotel which were good for hotel pool food. There are plenty of places up and down the street from the hotel including the Gelato place for breakfast - $20 for 2 adults and kid. Danni's and the Itialian wine bar - great pizza and good wine prices. We got pizza from the Itialian place and wine from the grocery store (2 blocks down from hotel to the left) and sat by the pool o eat - best meal of the entire trip.

About 3/4 mile hike on pavement to a very cool and refreshing waterfall. Definitely worth the 45 minute drive there. Old San Juan.

The service level was poor and it was not just because of the typical Caribbean service level. The staff does not know how to deal with guests and there is no communication between departments. The elevators in the hotel were not working properly and there were always lots of guests and housekeepers waiting for them. I had more than one housekeeper cut me off to get into an elevator without even waiting for it to empty out. I asked for a late check out the day before leaving and was given it for 1 p.m.. At noon on my check out date I had 2 different housekeepers knocking on the door within 15 minutes of each other trying to get in to turn around the room. When I called the front desk to get them to stop sending people they had no idea. My room was not ready upon check in and they gave me pager to let me know when it would be ready which never went off. I went to the front desk a 1/2 hour after check in time to see if it was ready and it had been for a while. They accussed me of being out of the pager range - which I wasn't - I was sitting at the pool the entire time. They also messed up my bill upon check in and then argued with me when I tried to be honest with them. As for the property itself - it is newly renovated. The rooms are nice and make sure you get a room with ocean and or pool view. A city view will be horrible. The ocean is very rough and there is a bad undertow which they warn you about. The pool area was nice. There is an Italian resturant which didn't look like it was any spectaular so I didn't eat in it. There are alot of kids there and also a lot of business meetings going on. I had to walk through a foyer with one going on to access the business center and was confronted by the person running the meeting. There is no other way to the business center but through that area. The hotel is in a good location. There is a Starbucks across the street and many restaurants all up and down Ashford Avenue. I felt safe walking alone to any of those places. There is a lot of construction in Condado Beach and in a few years it will be much better. They do lock the gates to beach access at 6 p.m. because it is a public beach. There are a lot of police out. Puerto Rico definetly has crime issues and there are alot of vacate buildings. I did find the people friendly and Old San Juan was great.

We received an email staying that the snorkeling trip was cancelled due to weather. I became worried what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on with weather. Long story short the weather forecast was thunderstorms daily (So I called the hotel and was advised that it had rained daily but for the moist part the weather was great so I trusted this and proceeded with our trip. We paid for prepayment parking in the Ontario Park and Fly (Do not do this Priceline may not be aware bust they are a rip off Priceline charges you per day and then they billed us per hour uurrgghh) So we fly in the Puerto Rico without incident again Priceline may not be aware of this but Budget is horrible rude rude when we arrived Angel was arguing with a customer on the phone and making faces to us that the person was rambling. We were not happy to have to deal with him after a 9-\u00c2\u00bd flight but what the heck the customer was probably rambling and Angel was probably unprofessional. Yes Angel was very unprofessional I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an insurance agent and understand the additional insurance and their job to sell it. Angel seemed to take it personal I declined the coverage, which is weird, but something quickly I dismissed not to my knowledge he continued to discuss my decision with my husband after I walked away. We were not pleased. We go to the Marriott in out stained seat, smoke filled rental car. The hotel was stunning; the room was ready but had two beds? I was told Priceline requests the double beds to maintain a lower price and we can change rooms no charge (great) Stephanie was awesome she also hinted to us about possible upgrades (we upgraded to first class on the flight and it was so so so very sad. I was not worth a 1.00 but we gave them 300.00 for the seats. Anyway, our room was upgraded to 609 for 25.00 GET THIS ROOM! You have 1 King size bed, and two balconies I mean large balconies one is pool view the second is ocean it made the trip it really did. The gym was great I used it twice my husband daily, the restaurant with the buffet was our favorite we found a small mom and pops restaurant in Kauai (Eggberts) with the world best pancakes this place is number two, clean plates and silverware and great great food. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid of buffets but enjoyed this one daily in 6 days for twp people we spent about 400.00 on three meals daily be prepared! The Hotel is the only one in the area not the El Condeor or the Ritz that is within walking distance of local stores and restaurant, star bucks is across the street J and the other hotels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have shopping (Gucci, Louis Vutton, or just simply souvenirs and a beach none of them) Ok before I end TAKE the tour through the Rainforest via Priceline not the hotel it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just like the real thing the tour guide was a proud man proud of his people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history and the beautiful island he was so great!

We had lunch in some small family restaurant in the Rain forest the food wad great the show was awesome (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see the show when you go ps what do you think about the dog on the roof) Thank you Marriott San Juan Thank you Priceline.

The entire staff was friendly, helpful and professional. The room itself was extremely nice. Big flat screen TV, nice bathroom with marble counters and plenty of room. The bed was sooooooo comfortable. I would like to have brought it home with me! My daughter had never gambled so we went to the casino. I was just getting ready to take her picture when security came over and said it wasn't allowed (oops!) We didn't know that. We were just trying to document her first try at the slot machine. We were on the 10th floor and had a \"city view\". Didn't realize we had a balcony, and when we did the vew was spectacular. The view to the left was the Atlantic Ocean and the view to the right was the city. Naturally we preferred the view of the ocean. There were 2 pools, one was geared more for kids, but adults had fun in it too and the other had a swim up bar. The pools were never overcrowded and neither was the beach. There were always lounges available when you wanted them and there was always someone from the hotel there who would carry them to where you wanted. The beach was extremely clean and uncrowded. We were there from a Friday until Tuesday and even over the weekend it wasn't packed. There were two restaurants in the hotel. We only ate at LaVista. Food was good. I tried the buffet one night just to say I did. I definitely could not eat my monies worth, but the food was extremely good. The bar area was a lot of fun. There was live music every night and the drinks were great. It was always busy there in the evening, but not to where you couldn't find a spot to sit or dance and have fun.

Wish we could have stayed longer. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Before arrival called the concierge desk and talked to Nancy who was fantastic. Although she was not able to assist me, she took my contact information in case we were cut off and transferred me to the tour desk where I dealt with Robert \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another wonderful experience. Robert gave me a lot of great information and was extremely helpful. Moments later the phone rang and it was Nancy from concierge making sure I had gotten what I needed. This is before we even got there! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 We arrived very early \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 11:00 a.m. not expecting our room to be ready. Juan, at the front desk, was able to upgrade us (for a small fee) to an ocean front room on the 12th floor. We went and had lunch and when we came back at 12:30, our room was ready. The bags were delivered within moments of our getting in to the room and the bellman who delivered them was beyond helpful, getting us ice, giving us local area information, etc. We explored the room, which included a small fridge which comes in very handy, full size iron and ironing board, large size umbrella, two wonderful robes and slippers, plenty of good hangers, lots of towels and one bottle of complimentary water (replaced daily). By the way, for the lady who wrote in a previous review that she had such trouble securing a connecting room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are available, as ours was a connecting room (1212). The room has a nice balcony with two chairs and a small table. We slept with the door open and the sound of surf putting us to sleep each night. All rooms are non-smoking, so you do have people outdoors smoking on their balcony, which can be annoying if the smell bothers you. The bathroom was really nice with plenty of counter space, four electrical outlets, a deep tub and rainshower-type shower head with good water pressure and plenty of hot water. A particular pet peeve of mine is a toilet that flushes so loud that it wakes up the rest of the floor in the middle of the night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in this case, the toilet is nice and quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure someone out there will appreciate my noting this particular fact! The bed was ultra comfortable as were the pillows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so much so that I actually ordered a couple of pillows from their on-line store. Cleanliness was top-notch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the room was spotless. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use wi-fi, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address that issue. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Staff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as I mentioned earlier, we had a wonderful experience with the staff. There was not one staff member that we encountered during our stay who was not friendly, helpful, and/or smiling. We received a courtesy call the evening of our arrival making sure that we had everything we needed. There are many bell staff opening doors, getting cabs (plenty of cabs readily available at the hotel and they have pre-negotiated rates to various oft-traveled locations, which is really nice). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As previously mentioned, this hotel is family-friendly. If you object to kids, then keep this in mind. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a place that has activities designed for children, this is a great option. At the entrance to the pool there is a big activities board that lists all the goings-on for both kids and adults each day. At the towel desk, they also will loan out books and games for all ages. Beach chairs are plentiful, umbrellas do cost extra. Bar staff will wait on you while sitting at the pool and/or beach (the drinks are wonderful, but beware, they will sneak up on you). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very rough, yes, but people were still swimming and there are many local young people who surf with boogie boards. The hotel keeps the beach clean. There is plenty of sun to be had on the beach for those who find the pool area too shaded. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Security \u00e2\u20ac\u201c plentiful, both inside the hotel, on the beach (Police on horseback, Police on scooters, Police on bicycles), and in the local area itself. We felt completely safe at all times. We stopped and chatted with one local lieutenant (tiente) who gave us some excellent tips about where to eat off the beaten path, etc. There are panhandlers, as in almost all cities, but they are not as aggressive as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen elsewhere and the police keep a pretty close eye on them. Primarily they are soliciting change from cars at intersections or outside of shops. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Misc: Hotel elevators were prompt and high-speed and all in good working order, meaning we never had to wait more than a few moments for an elevator. Lobby bar is definitely the happening spot for dancing at night, offering different themes/styles of music on different evenings. Casino is small, but nice. No smoking in the casino, unlike Vegas. There is a small grocery/liquor store two blocks from the hotel (turn left as you exit the property) and a 24-hour Walgreens (does not sell alcoholic beverages) across the street. There are many restaurants offering any type of food you can think of, within easy walking distance of the hotel. El Dorado, a few blocks away and on a back street, offers a lunch special for $5.50 from 11-3 (you have to ask for it) with everything from chicken to pork chops to seafood and plentiful portions. If you are traveling with young ladies in your group, be aware that there is a tremendous amount of construction going on, and the construction workers are the same as in any other city. They sometimes pay more attention to the sights, than what they are supposed to be constructing. There is very high-end shopping a few blocks to the right as you exit the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Gucci, Vuitton, Cartier, etc. We went on a catamaran trip with Eastwind Cats - snorkeling trip to Culebra - which was totally wonderful and worth every cent! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 All in all, we loved it and will be back. We may stay at La Concha next time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also a Marriott-owned Renaissance property \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once their construction is done, as it seems they have fewer children and are a touch more upscale (check out their lobby and pool area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ultra sophisticated.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay in Marriott in April 2008\u201d", "Author": "yasi218", "ReviewID": "UR15193552", "Content": "We just returned from our mini-vacation in San Juan, PR in Mid April, 2008.

The beach itself is not the best as all the beaches around the island-you need to visit surrounding island if you want a great beach experience.

We liked Cafe de Angel, really good PR food, good prices.. Also, I would recommend Ummo, the argentinian grill down to the left. Had a great dinner there and it's a very stylish place. We went on a snorkeling trip with East Island Cats, recommended by the hotel and had a great trip. We took a \"van\" with a group of others to Fajardo to reach the catamaran. On the way there, our van got a flat...(really flat) we had to stop at a gas station...but they sent another van that was already at the marina to pick us up..they got there in 5 minutes, so it wasn't too bad.

The hotel, itself was just amazing. I booked the pool/ocean view room, full expecting a view of something unpleasant with just a peek at the ocean. What we found was an incredible vista of 2 gorgeous pools surrounded by gently swaying palm trees with a turquoise ocean just beyond the palms. I was stunned. This was my view for much of my stay while we sat on our balcony. It made for wonderful breakfasts. The room, itself was immaculate, with well-appointed furnishings and an amazingly comfortable bed and wide-screen TV. Usually, I spend very little time in a hotel room while vacationing, but the pleasantness of the room and the view made the room a destination, itself. In fact, it's the most time I spent in a room on a vacation. And it was wonderful. The pool and beach areas were fantastically clean and well-kept, with enough lounge chairs for everyone, even on a crowded weekend day. The location of the hotel, right on the Beach, within central Condado makes it very convenient to some of the best restaurants, Old San Juan and El Yunque rain forest. I just have one small complaint. The internet access is not free and at $14.95 per day is pretty steep. Also, the bandwidth is not very good. Even within my room, I rarely had an excellent connection (mostly good or very good) which made using video and Skype problematic. We can't wait until we can return.

The location is absolutely perfect - right on the beach in a great area of San Juan. The rooms are nicely maintained with flat screen televisions and marble bathrooms. There is a nice size casino on premises as well as a lobby lounge with music and full bar. The pool is huge with a wading side and hottub. I especially liked the employees of the hotel. The security staff is all around and very friendly - not at all like the Miami Beach bouncers. The front desk person was also very nice but I could not talk her into a free upgrade. The only negatives I found at the hotel was the guy setting up beach chairs and umbrellas. I nicely asked him to set up an umbrella for my wife and he walked right past her and left the beach with the umbrella laying next to her. Also, the concerge with short black hair was on the phone when I approached the desk. I waited five minutes and she never even acknowleged my presence. Are you ready for some travel duck tips? 1. The hotel has two sections: a main tower and a cabana tower. In my opinion, you want to be in the main tower and insist on a room above the 10th floor. We had a city view room on the 11th floor and could still hear street noise below. Of course, the ocean view rooms are nicer but will come at a cost. I was very happy with the city view room which actually had a nice view of the city. Just don't spend the money for an upgrade and get a \"pool view\" room in the cabana tower or a floor lower than 10. The cabana rooms are set farther back from the beach and the lower floors appear to have palm trees blocking some of the rooms. 2. Who likes to spend $18 for a breakfast. If so, enjoy breakfast in the hotel. If you like to spend $3.95 for eggs, bacon, toast, and unlimited good coffee then walk across the street to your left to Piu Bello (the gelato place). When you get there, you can sit outside and enjoy the people passing by. The lunch menu also looked good. 3. For an amazing dinner option, walk 15 minutes to your right across the street and go to Ajili M\u00c3\u00b3jili. The restaurant is fabulous and don't be scared away by the fancy exterior. I found people dressed nicely and very casually in there. The meal was very reasonable - $70 for two people including appetizer, nice tip, 2 entrees, and one drink each. Speaking of appetizer, you must order the sampler platter (1/2 order for two people is more than enough). You can thank me later. 4. For lunch options, try Latin Star down the street. - also reasonably priced Puerto Rican food but a more casual setting. Avoid paying $3.25 for water at the hotel by stopping at Walgreens across the street to stock up. 5. Enjoy a drink at the lobby bar at night which gets quite lively with the locals. I was there and ending up sitting next to a local who was passed out at the bar in his swimsuit. He woke up and bought these four older ladies from New York some drinks. However, the older ladies refused the drinks and told the nice local to get lost. They went and talked with some guys from New Jersey. I ended up having one of the drinks with the nice local. Okay, why am I telling you this story? Back to the tips :) 6. The beach is beautiful but the surf is extremely rough. Don't let your little ducks go in the water very far. 7. A taxi to Old San Juan will cost $12. Don't be ripped off. Better yet, walk to the bus stop and catch the bus for $.75 (exact change needed). While at the bus stop, you will find a few other tourists from the hotel so you can split a cab as another option. 8. I found the streets very safe to walk at night with police everywhere. Of course, use common sense but walking to the above destinations should be perfectly fine.

We travel extensively and we have NEVER experienced anything like the treatment we received from the Marriot staff. The bottom line is that Marriot was going to charge us $6,000 for two rooms (which we were ready and willing to pay), but they could not guarantee that 1) the rooms were adjoining and 2) that each room had 2 double beds. In an era of computers, i could not believe that they could not grant our request. I spent HOURS upon HOURs speaking with Marriot staff and managers at the reservation desk an the front desk at the hotel itself - each time, the story was different. Finally, a reservation agent said we could have a suite with two double beds and a pull out couch, which would have worked well for us in lieu of the 2 double rooms. But i had not seen this configuration offered on the hotel website so, before i booked it, i asked \"are you sure the hotel offers this suite configuration.\" The answer was a very firm \"yes we do\". A few minutes after we booked the reservation, the confirmation email arrived and stated that the reservation was for a suite with \"one king bed and a pull out couch\". My husband and i became so frustrated and distrustful of Marriot's service that we cancelled our plans to go to Puerto Rico - with our young children, we could not afford to arrive at the hotel with all of the unknowns we faced over the phone.

Conveniently located near Old San Juan; you must visit El Morro. You can take a bus for just 75 cents each way [busses run inconsistently], or a cab if you prefer. Cheap rental car place called Charlie's across the street is recommended versus the onsite Hertz rental. We drove to the rain forest and Luquillo beach [very close to one another]. Highly recommend for a day trip. Near Hotel there is good selection of shopping and restaurants. If you can't be without your Starbucks, there is one across the street, and a big Walgreens just blocks away for anything you may have forgotten. However I thought the hotel coffee was superior to any Starbucks. Hotel has a casino, or you can go to others nearby. HOTEL staff was VERY polite and helpful at every turn. They really want to please you. The lobby gets quite loud at night because everything is in the lobby area. Food in Condado area is very expensive. Mini frig in room is good for keeping water bottles , juice, snacks, etc... Plenty of convenience store options nearby to stock up on these. Restaurant selection in the neighborhood is good, though we did not have any outstanding meals at any of them. La Concha down the street has good tapas, but again expensive. We had our 2 kids with us, because it was spring break. My younger one had fun, my pre-teen was a bit bored. Nothing really for teens to do at hotel. Pool is small for a hotel of this size -- no deep water for diving, and no swim lanes if that is important to you. 2 Shallow connected pools and water slide make it a good pool environment for families that have YOUNG kids [under 10]. Swim up bar is convenient for lunch. Beware on the weekends [especially holiday/school breaks]-- this place gets swamped with people, making it hard to get pool/beach chairs. They have a club membership for locals to join and use the facilities, and when we arrived Easter weekend, it was a ZOO! Ocean is very rough, so recommend taking day trips to calmer beaches like Luquillo or Isla Verde, particularly if you have kids and/or like longer beach walks. My kids had a blast at Luquillo, and they have lifeguards there as well as bathrooms, food, parking etc... NOTE: Most beaches in PR are public, and many including the hotel do not have lifeguards. There are some unsightly graffitied buildings adjacent to the hotel beach area, and lots of police around for some reason, so if a serene gorgeous tranquil beach is a high priority, this is not the beach for you. I recommend this hotel for people who will venture out, rent a car and take advantage of all the things that the island has to offer -- there is a lot to see and do! However if you are coming for an extended stay and want a place with lots of things to do on the premises and are NOT willing to venture out, then this hotel is limited in its amenities/activities. Also, there is a decent health club [enjoyed using it], complete with staff, and an adjoining spa [didn't use; heard it was okay]. You can keep up with your workout while on vacation. I noticed that many people are out jogging and walking for fitness on the Condado, probably due to its flat terrain. Seemed to be a popular place for business travelers to stay due to convenient location near business districts, and airport. It may seem that I didn't like the hotel, but I did. I just wish that it was less crowded when we arrived on the weekend; during the week it was noticeably less crowded making for a more enjoyable experience. Perhaps during a NON-school break week it would be more relaxing. The weather was beautiful and spring is great in PR, because it is warm without being overly hot. Summer in Puerto Rico can be extremely uncomfortable due to the very strong sun and high temps. No matter what time of year you travel to PR, bring lots of sunblock, and some aloe in case you get burned. Also, hat/visor and sunglasses are a MUST.

We have been sleeping with the balcony door open and the beds are so comfortable! We are on the third floor in the \"tower\" overlooking the beach. This is a PERFECT room and location. We have 314 and 315. There is a shorter adjacent building called the \"cabanas\", I don't know much about it, but I can tell you that this room and location is awesome. If you are coming here to relax on the beach it is perfect, if you are a pool person I might think twice. The pool is ok, but not one of the better ones. My family has no interest in hanging by the pool here. This is not a \"trendy\" or modern hotel either. It is a cross between a business hotel and a family hotel. The casino is right in the lobby and there is a nice bar there as well. The staff here is great. Everyone here is helpful and nice. Ashford avenue (the street the hotel is on) is a great street to walk up and down. There are great restaurants up and down. Last night we ate at a place 2 blocks down on the left side. I can't remember the name of it but it had a green awning and we ate under it. It was phenomenal! A little pricey, but expected. The service is slow around here, but I expected that.

We found the hotel safe, the beach clean and beautiful and the pool was great because there was no deep end so we could relax a little more than usual. The room was clean and the beds comfortable and the staff was incredibly courteous and friendly. The only drawback for us was the food--La Vista restaurant didn't exactly offer fresh or inspiring cuisine. But this is the only on-site option for lunch and to please the small-child palette. Admittedly my husband and I are \"foodies\" and would have been very adventurous if we'd been without the kids, but for poolside snacks we were stuck with La Vista. Our kids were perfectly happy with the cuisine there--although after a few days even they got sick of chicken nuggets and hot dogs. It was, without a doubt, incredibly expensive for what you got. At nearly $400 per night for the room and note even an included continental breakfast, this was a VERY expensive vacation. We got from this vacation exactly what we needed--an easy to reach, relaxing locale that didn't require too much work and negotiating food choices for the kids. I would stay at the Marriott again with kids. If we were going without them, however, we might stay elswhere on the island away from the big-box food chains. Another observation about food--the restaurants we went to were all incredibly expensive. It wasn't unusual (even away from the hotel) to spend $120 on lunch and more on dinner.

It's also on the beach which is nice, and actually larger than many other hotel beaches on the island. The casino is decent size although pretty tight. It only receives 3 stars because of the following: pool - it looks huge from the picture but one of the pools is a kiddie pool, leaving only one for hundreds of guests. food - a disaster. We ate a brunch at the place downstairs and the food was so terrible I didn't eat --- and I always eat. Plus it was pricey. staff - not helpful or friendly. Had a double billing on an internet charge and the front desk acted like it was my fault and even talked about me in Spanish with a coworker in front of me apparently not knowing or caring I understand Spanish. lobby - none to speak of except the bar and many tables/chairs set up for the dance floor which was very popular with locals. Interesting to watch, but not every night. kids - tons of them. If you want rest and relaxation, good luck. Maybe your timing will be better than ours but it was crawling with kids whose parents thought vacation meant letting my kids run around screaming and yelling at each other.

We arrived for check-in early (around 1:30pm) and were told that they had assigned us rooms but that they weren't ready yet, so they held our bags in a storage area near the front entrance and we were given a claim check to pick up our luggage when we got our room keys. Instead of sitting around the lobby (or pool) to wait for the rooms, we decided to take the tour of the Bacardi Factory ($35.00 to get there by taxi although the tour itself was free) and decided to stop for an early dinner on the way back. We took the ferry from the area near the Bacardi factory (taxi- $3 pp to get from the Bacardi Factory to the ferry and then $.50 for the ferry itself). We ate at La Mallorquina in OSJ and then caught a taxi back to the hotel ($15) so we didn't get back to the hotel till after 6pm at which time our rooms were ready. We got two pool/ocean view rooms w/ double beds on the 11th floor which were clean and very comfortable with a very nice balcony and view. I noticed that our bathroom door squeaked but I fixed it using some lip balm... Our A/C also made a strange clunking sound every time the blower cut off but we quickly got used to it. As other posters have mentioned, the lobby does get loud w/ the local musicians each night, but we couldn't hear it in our rooms at all.... We went downstairs for a drink in the lobby bar and to check out the casino our first night, and noticed that the locals outnumbered the hotel guests 2-1 in the lobby bar and casino (and even more so on Friday and Saturday night) but we weren't treated any differently by anyone (ie. bartenders or casino staff) because we were hotel guests. On Friday we ate breakfast across the street at Starbucks even though they do have a small 'market bakery' food area right in the hotel lobby where you can buy pastries, bagels coffee etc.. then went on an organized tour of El Yunque rainforest and Luquillo Beach. When we got back to the hotel at 5pm we went to the beach but were told exactly at 6pm that the beach was closing (not sure why they close the beach at 6pm each night?) so we moved to the pool area~which says it closes at 7pm although I always saw people in the pool area past 7pm (at least in the hot tub area). As other posters have mentioned, the pool area doesn't get sun until later on in the day and then only for a little while, but I took a quick dip and the water wasn't too cold for me. There were several kids in the pool too although I noticed that the water slide was dry (I hadn't noticed earlier in the day whether it had been working then or not). The air temp. was about 80 degrees every day and the only rain we had the entire trip was late on Saturday evening and it was very brief. After our quick stop at the pool we went to our rooms to change for dinner and ate dinner at the Hotel restaurant Tuscany's (Italian). Everyone enjoyed their meals and afterwards we went upstairs to have a drink in the lobby/bar and listened to the music for a while although it was a little disconcerting because the hotel had a \"Mexican\" theme night so they had both a Mexican Marichi group playing and then they alternated that music w/ the local latin salsa/merengue group. We were all tired from our tour so we went to bed around 11:30 pm although I'm sure the party in the lobby lasted until Saturday morning (the casino stays open till 4am). On Saturday we had breakfast in the hotel 'casual dining' restaurant La Vista and although I only had a bagel my friends had the breakfast buffet and said everything tasted pretty good. We went to the beach until noon (there were plenty of chairs and umbrellas available at that time and I always saw several piles of extra chairs so finding a chair was no problem and the hotel staff was very good about moving beach chairs around and setting up umbrellas for guests). I read another post that mentioned the umbrellas cost extra to rent and while we didn't get one ourselves I didn't notice others who did get them paying the staff so I'm not sure whether they're included as part of the resort fee they tack on (approx. $21.00 per night per room) or not? We went to our rooms to change (they had already been cleaned!) and took a taxi into OSJ to go shopping and have a late lunch/early dinner at the Parrot Club. Later on that night, we got a little hungry so we went to La Vista a little before 10pm (I believe they close at 10pm) and the waiter was very accomodating even though they were about to close up for the night, when we said we only wanted to have dessert and coffee. The desserts were all delicious!! On Sunday morning, we went to the beach for a few hours before check-out and then headed up to shower and check-out by noon. After checkout we had a drink in the lobby bar and left to catch a taxi to the airport at 1pm for our flight back home at 4:45pm. We were advised by our taxi driver that the airport got very busy on Sundays so we got there by 1:30pm and while it was busy the USDA Agricultural checkpoint and the TSA security checkpoint lines moved very quickly so we sat around waiting for our flight for about 2.5 hrs. All in all, a very nice trip...

We were greeted at the front desk and received an upgrade due to my Marriott status. We had an ocean view room which was very clean and enjoyed the king size bed and flat screen TV. The pool area was very large, but too many trees around the pool which blocked the sun. We had to move our lounge every hour or so to find the sunny spots. Also, San Juan is very windy, and I am not talking about soft tradewinds, these were very strong at times and blew our towels and shoes around the pool deck.

We booked a room with a city view and upon arrival, got upgraded to a corner room, which is always more spacious and in this case, had two balconies to choose from. The room was beautiful and well maintained - great bedding! Every single person we encountered at this hotel (staff) couldn't have been more pleasant or accommodating. Housekeeping, security, concierge, bar, beach hands, towel keepers, casino workers - everyone is obviously so well trained in hospitality. We were impressed. The beach here is small and if you are one to lounge all day, you will have to position yourself way to the left of the hotel in the morning, so that when the sun hits the hotel around noon, you are not caught in the shade. Being on the Atlantic side, the sand is not the usual Caribbean white powder, rather a grainy yellow. Not that this is a problem, just a heads up. Same with the pool area - while lovely, it is shaded by the hotel and trees. The surf can be wild, and the undertow is something to take seriously. You will not find the calm and gentle waves of the Caribbean on this beach. That said, I think it is a positive. The restaurants in Condado are fabulous. We loved Tijuana's close by. The food is authentic and delicious with great service. The La Mama margarita makes it worth the visit and I'll leave it at that! We also found Budatai to be fantastic, very chic. The whole Condado area has changed a great deal since the last time we visited. The shopping is world class - Christian Dior, Cartier, Ferragamo and Miu Miu are a stone's throw away from the Marriott. Old San Juan is not too far, about a two mile walk, and the restaurants there are worth looking into. We went to Marmalade one night and have to say it is one of the finest restaurants we have ever come across. New York style dining, but reasonably priced - at least consistent with other dining in the area. For those that are concerned about safety in San Juan, I will say that we were both very impressed with the level of security. Clearly, this area is growing and the tourism department is going to ensure that visitors are comfortable, and that the area is secure and well maintained. All in all, I can't wait to return to San Juan. I'd return to the Marriott in a heartbeat. If you are a business traveler, don't give it a second thought.

This was perfect versus having to go to a resort restaurant for breakfast. In the evenings they had light snacks and an honor bar. The staff in the hotel couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. The casino was pleasant and just enough for an evening activity. The gym was serviceable though 1 elliptical machine isn't enough. We had dinner in a few of the local restaurants near the hotel and they were quite good. The negatives were this property is located on a small beach with only about 1/2 mile of beach. Pretty tough to take a long walk on the beach when it's so small. There were no water sports like wave runners or sailboats like other carribean resorts. The water slide was a bit small for my older kids though they enjoyed it.

My family arrived at 10 AM and by 3PM they still did not have our \"suite\" ready. Mika the front desk manager refused to give us our room # though all our friends and other hotel guests that arrived after us had their rooms. We understand that check-in is at 4PM, but, if rooms are made up at noon there should be no reason for a guest staying in a $1000 per night jr. suite to wait 6 hours for a room. When we arrived, we confirmed with MIka that we were waiting for our \"brand new ocean suite.\" We had high expectations considering we paid $830 plus 21% per night.. $1000 for our suite times 3 nights $3000..of which our credit card was charged, a \"non refundable rate!\" At 3:45 Mika finally told us our room # but said we could not go up since the room was not ready, I decided to take a peek because something did not sound right..especially when Mika said the city view suites are nicer because the ocean is pitch black at night. I entered room 2003, the supposed jr. suite, while the housekeepers were still cleaning up. It was a total view of the city and there was 1 average size hotel room with a king bed and small sofa. I almost fainted when I looked into the room next door that didnt say jr. suite and was told it was a regular room...same size as my \"jr. suite.\" The Marriott knowingly put my family in a room(with a sign outside that said jr. suite), the size of a hotel room with city views and tried to charge me for a suite! I immediately went down and spoke to the very nice \"hotel manager\" and he said they had \"no suites\" and he would get me a regular room. This new room was lovely, but, i had booked a suite and it seems Marriott has no trouble booking and charging for suites and putting guests in regular rooms. This new room had the mustiest smokiest smell,but, at this ppoint we were out of options since our credit card had already been charged...and it was New Years weekend. A night front desk manager, who did not know my story, said room 2003 \"is not a suite\" it is a regular priced corner room...and that the suites have 2 rooms. Additionally, the beach is shady and you have to keep on moving your chairs..not to mention the red flag is always up and they tell you the ocean is dangerous. The pool and \"hot tub\" are freezing and shady as well. For the prices the Marriott charges for their \"resort,\" there should be turn down service, and chocolates on the pillow would be nice. I was told this was a a non smoking establishment, and I smelled smoke in various locations, not only in my room. Additionally, the lobby is one massive Bar with \"blasting\" music, hi-top tables and bar stools, The management has 'removed all couches\" and does not cater to its guests... New Years Eve, the Marriott recommended we go to the Caribe Hilton since the Hilton was having a party. The Marriott had \"sold\" its hi-top tables with bar stools to the local residents. They roped off over 80% of the lobby. The hotel guests were delegated to a \"back dark corner of the lobby.\" No hats, noisemakers, or lit space for the hotel guests! They made a make shift bar with some bottles of alcohol as well as a price list for drinks. ..because the gigantic real bar in the lobby was closed to hotel guests....not very festive for News Years Eve. Our children sat on luggage racks at the front of the \"lit\" lobby then we all went to bed before midnight. Not bad for a \"hotel that charges $600 a night including taxes, \" over Xmas week.

Unfortunately the weather was horrid most of the time. Subtropical storm Olga kicked up as soon as I arrived and ruined two days of my stay, and made the next two only tolerable weather wise. It was finally nice when I left. Ha! The hotel is older, but newly renovated. Everything inside is nicely decorated, including some nice holiday arrangements. It was very clean in all areas. There are two restaurants, one casual (La Vista), one slightly more formal ( Tuscany's). The food was good, the service very nice. There was a good lunch buffet at La Vista with excellent dessert. They weren't too pricey either, for a hotel. But they weren't really local cuisine. I ate there mostly when convenient as the weather kept me in at times. There are also several small venues for coffee and sandwiches. There is also a Asian noodle bar in the casino which is pretty good. The casino is decent, there are a couple BlackJack tables, some 3 card poker and Texas Hold'em games that go on. Of course many slot machines are there as well. I didn't get to use the Spa services, but the Fitness center was pretty good, fairly well equipped with modern machines. The room I had was pretty small but very nice. It had a fantastic King sized bed, a nice 32 inch LG Flat screen, and all the typical amenities including Internet access. The balcony was nice and large. Everything was clean and daily cleaning service was prompt and well done. The pool was beautiful, but very shallow. It was more form than function. For some odd reason, the whirlpool was only for use up to 6pm, which is when I believe they turned off the heat. This seems silly, the best time to use the whirlpool is at night. The beach was right off the pool, but only marginal. Scenery wise there are several hotels around that look like they may collapse at any moment and there was construction next door. This hotel is in the city, don't expect a beautiful remote tropical beach. So with that said, the sand and water are nice, no seaweed or rocks, no jellyfish when I was around. The surf is DANGEROUS and UNGUARDED. The red flag was up the entire time. But if you are careful ( adult ) and a good swimmer in shape, the waves can be a blast. Condado is OK, but I would not really bother exploring it much given the Old San Juan is minutes away. Old San Juan is a fantastic old city with much to explore. Great shopping, restaurants, clubs, and history. It is great fun to just walk around it. I would recommend this hotel as a base, Puerto Rico has a ton to do, so I would just use this place as place to relax after exploring the island.

No lifeguard on duty, large rocks close to the hotel perimeter and a very dangerous under-toe are all reasons to keep your children by the beautiful pool. We found out that there are numerous deaths at the beach each year, so its something you have to be strict with your children about. Beach: The beach is beautiful and throughout the week its very private. Nice waves all year round if you're into surfing or boogie boarding. High water temperatures and a sparkling blue color make it very pleasent. If you're not a strong swimmer you can still enjoy the beach because the waves don't crash directly on the sand...you have 10 feet of calm water to enjoy; (again, i just wouldn't trust any children to stay within the calm waters unless you're with them). As soon as you walk onto the sand the cabana boys set out your beach chairs wherever you want to lay out and once in a while waiters will come on to the beach at your service. Extremely relaxing place to lay out with great views in multiple directions. The beach bar is a great place to have a drink and even watch the games and the bar tender there is superb! Pool: The pool area has its own bar and even a slide. The sun doesn't hit the entire pool area, so you might have to move around a bit as the sun moves around the hotel, but there are more than enough chairs to find a good spot. With views of the ocean, there's just nothing not to like about the pool area. Lobby/Casino/dance floor: This is what seperates this hotel from any other in the Condado area. The casino is a decent size and its open 24 hrs. The lobby has a great bar which seemed like it was 24 hrs as well. Also, there is a great band that plays Latin music at night. Ther were always people on the dance floor, and during weekends you'll see some locals dancing at a near professional level. Lots of fun late into the night! Food: The hotel makes the best Pina Colada you will ever have. Make sure you try it with and without alcohol. You also won't find a better mojito. Seriously, the pina coladas and the mojitos in the hotel are a trip highlight!!! The pool bar, beach bar, and lobby bar all make these drinks the same way, so you can get them any time. The restaurants at the hotel are high quality as is the food on the room service menu, BUT, the prices are high and you can do better just outside of the hotel. I'll elaborate on this more in a bit, but I guess it makes sense to dine in the hotel for that one or two times a trip when you really don't feel like walking a few blocks. Rooms: The rumor is that the hotels upgrade your view for fairly cheap...You're shelling out nice money to go to the Caribbean; Go the extra mile and get the ocean view!!! I enjoyed sitting on the balcony for about an hour each day and you will too. The room itself was very high quality. Nice beds, nice flat screen TV, nice bathroom, nice decor...The room was perfect! Service: Top notch in all areas. I hate when people leave their one bad service experience in these boards...pay no attention, the staff knows exactly how to serve its guests! I was continually surprised at just how willing they were to pamper their guests. Surrounding area: The biggest pleasent surprise for me about my trip was Ashford ave. (the street the hotel is on). Walking directly outside of the hotel you have everything you could ever want. Bars, dozens of great restaurants, internet cafe, starbucks, food markets, fast food chains, puerto rican food stands, great clothing stores, gift shops, more casinos etc. etc. etc. Do yourself a favor and take a few walks in both directions on Ashford; its really a classy street! -There's a restaurant open 24 hrs called STAR a block or so down from the hotel (make a right out of the hotel). Full bar (with great margaritas) and tasty authentic Puerto Rican food with outdoor seating. Great for breakfast, lunch or a 2 AM snack! Walk 5 blocks down from there to find two great restaurants for dinner: WAIKIKI and ROPA VIEJA. Both have a good bar, good food and outdoor seating facing the ocean!!! There's a Japanese Hibachi place almost touching the hotel called Cherry Blossom. Its no better than other hibachi places you'd find, but its a nice place with good food and its so close to the hotel that you might as well go. We had a good dinner there. Everyone loves to give tips on where to eat on Ashford, but the truth is you really can't go wrong with anything there. Tours: I think its imperative to either do a tour of the rainforest or to do a boat tour of some of the near-by islands. We took the Caterman tour (booked it right in the hotel). They take you on a nice boat to a beautiful beach and they bring you to a great place to snorkel. Its really a nice day for 90$ a person including food and even drinks! It was worth the money. Next time we're going to do the rainforest tour; we heard good things. $$ saving tips: -Old San Juan- they do tours in old San Juan...Save the $40 per person...Just take a $12 cab ride in and explore the area yourself. You'd probably find this to be more enjoyable anyway (Its not a museum; its just an interesting little city and you don't need a tour gide to enjoy it!!!) -The rooms have a refrigerator...Do yourself a favor and load up on drinks, fruit, snacks, water, even alcohol at the nearby food markets, walgreens, or liquor stores. -Don't eat more than once in the hotel...better food cheaper within 2 blocks of the hotel. + eat lunch cheap at some of the little in-door food stands. -don't rent a car....its just not necessary...the airport is a $15 cab ride and everything else is in walking distance other than the rain forests, which you should do with a cheap tour anyway!!! It was hard to find a good review (no offense to others) when i was thinking about booking this trip. Looking back I can't believe i let some of the other reviews make me hesitate on booking the trip, because we had a blast and it was pretty reasonable. For this reason, I tried to put down exactly what I wish I had been able to find (an honest, realistic, and thorough review)...so i hope it was helpful..Enjoy your trip! any other ?'s, you can email me at marcs12@yahoo.com", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, MI", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d", "Author": "pbennetts", "ReviewID": "UR11118108", "Content": "I can't say enough about this hotel and I am PICKY PICKY PICKY! I use to manage a hotel so I notice don't accept so so service or accomodations. We had a 15th floor corner ocean room with a balcony facing the pool and one facing the ocean. The balconies wrapped around the ENTIRE room! Worth EVERY PENNY! The beds are very comfy! There is a fridge in the room with bottled water left every day. There was also an executive club offering breakfast, pop, juice, water, fruit, cheese and hor dourves with happy hour each day on the 21st floor with an amazing view of the city. This is not offered to every room so ask in advance. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Concierge goes the extra mile to assist you. The doormen and taxi driviers have no idea where you are going so have directions and name of where you are going in hand ahead of time. Everything you need is at your doorstep. Starbucks, restaurants, shopping, drugstores, Old San Juan, airport, and Charles Car rental will come to the hotel and pick you up. You don't need a car as taxis are quite affordable but if you want to explore the island or go to El Yunque a car is your best option. The beach is clean and has a boardwalk near you. The wait staff brings drinks right to the beach and even though they are a bit pricey, you get your monies worth! Very yummy and very potent! The gym has up to date equipment with great locker rooms and sauna. The massage was out of this world! We ate at La Vista for the Thanksgiving Buffet and again outstanding. I highly recommend a restaurant called Pamela's. I have been there in 2005 and now in 2007. One of the best restaurants I have been to with not the highest pricetag! Many awards on the wall. It is a short taxi ride there from the hotel. Also Carli's Concierto Cafe in Old San Juan has great service and live jazz perfomed by one of the origianl Beach Boys! There is live music in the lobby and dancing. Did a boat excursion with East Wind Tours that was amazing. You must see the secluded islands, breathtaking! Didn't gamble but the casino looked nice and full of people. The only suggestion I have for the hotel is to have room service 24 hours and offer appetizers and maybe extend the hours of the pool area to just be able to sit down in that area and enjoy the outdoors. They close it off at 11. Also the bellmen need a computer outside to locate where you are going to. I would also start the service at the pool at 11 as opposed to 12 for the menu and drinks. Other than that this hotel gets FIVE STARS in my opinion. It is very hard to get what this hotel offers in the Carribean. I have been to many and this is the first hotel that has delivered what they advertise! Good Job Marriot Stellaris!

I'm an elite member of their rewards program. 2 - we travel a lot and have experienced all levels of hotels...from the cheapest to the best. 3 - we had two travel-friendly kids in tow. This hotel is a solid choice if you're looking for a good value at a chain hotel in Condado. We were upgraded to an oceanfront room (315) with a great view of the beach. The bathroom was nice-sized and the little balcony was perfect. The music/entertainment downstairs never disturbed us, and my kids enjoyed the bands. The pools are very nice - especially the kiddie pool if you have little ones....and they loved the water slide. The beach is always cleaned each morning, and there are a number of security attendants keeping an eye on it. Get a beach chair early and park yourself near the rocks...otherwise you'll get caught in the shadow of the hotel later in the afternoon. Staff is attentive and friendly - very good with our kids. The Condado neighborhood is up-and-coming - lots of construction going on around but we never heard it. Within several blocks you can find the Walgreens, Starbucks, DunkinDonuts, Wendy's, Subway if you need them. Take a taxi to Old San Juan - it's easy to get there and back. The forts are beautiful and it's fun to roam the streets (we felt very safe). My seven year old son is a history buff and loved OSJ. We ate at Aijili Mojili on Thanksgiving - I wasn't that impressed...but it is an easy walk from the Marriott. Rent a Jeep from Charlie's and go to El Yunque - it's amazing. Stop at Luquillo in the afternoon - so pretty! Overall, you can't wrong with the hotel - it's lacking in personality of Puerto Rico (generic hotel room) but is a convenient and friendly spot to hang out.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cSolid choice\u201d", "Author": "RichDC", "ReviewID": "UR10971645", "Content": "The hotel was nice: -- The rooms were recently redone so they are in good shape and kept clean. -- The location is excellent . . . on the beach and a short walk to some shops (including the much mentioned Walgreens) and a lot of different restaurants for different budgets. -- We tried the breakfast buffet and dinner buffet once each and found them to be of good quality and variety. -- Plenty of parking for a fee. -- The pool area was nice.

Keep in mind that the low-rise rooms are closed and under renovation. This did not present a problem as there was virtually no noise due the renovations . Staff: The staff at this hotel go out of their way to make your stay comfortable with one exception. I saw at least half a dozen waitstaff walking around the pool area in the 4 days there - was never once asked if we wanted anything from the bar. Nancy, the concierge, is especially nice. Very knowledgeable about the city, restauraunts, etc... Beach: Beach area was nice but many cigarette butts in the sand. I think the Isla Verde beach is a bit better. If you want a nice beach without crowds, best to rent a car and go to Luquillo or somewhere outside of the city. Remember, Puerto Rico has 365 beaches, go see them!!! This hotel is not in a 'hotel strip' like Isla Verde. Marriott seemed to be the only major hotel in the area. There is a lot of construction in this area with couple of new high rise hotels/timeshares being built. In a year or two this area of the Condado will be 'hopping' .

I was there from July 7 through the 21st. We had a beautiful corner room #1917 in the Tower which affords a great view of the beach and city. Looks like they were just renovated. Stay away from the cabana rooms though. They are not renovated and the difference between the two are night and day. We booked a midlevel room but because we were Marriott elite members, they upgraded us to an ocean view with the concierge lounge. Great beach front property. They even had a couple of sharks swim close by the beach. Nobody seemed to mind though which was realy strange to us. Also. did not want to leave out that the maid service was excellent! This hotel had one of the best concierge lounges we have ever seen. The food and the views are great and the service even better! Most days we ate there and saved on the food bills. It's worth it even if it cost you to get it. Nicole and Edwin were the best in there! Kudos to them for helping us with the many questions we had and the true service they gave! Seek them out! You can sit out on the balcony while your eating and see almost the entire island. A great view of the sunsets up there too. At the concierge desk at the check in counter, ask for Nancy. She was great in helping out with where to go and what to do. Also, knows alot of history about the island. Great job to her! The local area that it is in at first looks sketchy, but all of Puerto Rico looks like that. Be warned though, there is alot of crime on the Island with the illegal drug trade increasing and alot of gang activity. Hence, why you'll see alot of police all over the place. There are some nice resturants in the area. Stay away from the hotel ones. Very overpriced! Our favorite one was Pure and Natural next to Wendy's. A 5 minute walk from the hotel. An organic cafe that had amazing fresh fruit smoothies and great sanwiches among other fare too. Trips to take - We highly recommend the BioLuminesant Bay at night. This was one of the most amazing things we have ever done. Well worth it! Also went to the El Yunque Rainforest. We booked the trip through the hotel and took the low impact tour which was good. About $65.00 per person all included. Gus was our driver and he made it very enjoyable. He knows every zip code you can imagine too. 1st WARNING - Becareful though when booking a trip on East Island Tours which is through the hotel. We booked one going to Culebra which was supposed to be very beautiful. The day of our trip, we're bused almost 1 1/2 hours to the launch spot only to find out they changed the trip because they said the water was too rough. It did not look at all rough. They indicated that they would refund most of the trip which they did not do. Now we are fighting with our credit card company to see what they can do. We recommend that if it is cancelled, do not go because the couple of places they take you to are not worth the trip or money. Be warrned! 2nd WARNING - While the hotel is very nice, be warned of the fees they charge you. Our hotel room was $220 night. They charge a \"resort fee\" of 10% which nobody could explain to me what it was for. Finally, a manager told me it covered the \"free\" internet service (which we did not use), the phone service (which we did not use) and the chairs for the beach (we did use). The last night we were there, I spoke with the mgr and told him that we thought it was excessive to charge us a fee to use beach chairs for what we're charged for the room. He did refund the fee which over a two week period amounted to over $300. Plus, the tax is 11% too. They also sneek in a green tax which again was not explained very well and was taken off the bill. Check your bill out closely the night before you leave and resolve it then, not when you're leaving in the morning. Overall, the good weighed out the bad and we had a good time. But, if your looking for a real tropical vacation, San Juan is not the place. It is a nice place to visit once or twice, but most likely would not go back.

There are plenty of places nearby on Ashford Ave. so go out and explore. Ajili Mojili was a walk away and recommended for Puerto Rican food. Also, for dessert make sure to hit the gelato place across the street from the Marriott....so many choices of flavors! Overall we would definitely go back to the Marriott.

I'll make a bullet list of both experiences: ROOMS: *Cabana rooms offer outstanding views, a pretty large bathroom with tub/shower (not separate shower, which not everyone may like), and very comfortable beds. Even though I'm not a furniture freak and everything was fine, when I found out my boyfriend paid about $400/night for the room I almost hit him. Basically, I would expect a much more luxurious room for that price. Pretty much the $400 a night are for the views...and might be worth it, depending on your budget and what u look for \"room-wise\" *Tower rooms are ok, although I'm not sure if they are kind of small size-wise. I only spent the night with some friends, so didn't have much luggage + can't tell price per night sorry. One one fabulous thing I can comment on, though: that has been THE MOST COMFORTABLE BED AND PILLOWS i HAVE EVER SLEPT ON IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!! NO EXAGGERATION!! I don't know if I passed out right away and slept like a baby because I was buzzed with alcohol or because they were really just THAT incredible. U feel like u are sleeping on a cloud. I wanted to steal that bed and those pillows, darn it!!!!!! SERVICE: *Existent or not existent...that is the question. I had NO problems with the front desk and were helpful the times I approached them. Housekeeping were ok I guess. But at the pool, it can be REALLY bad or just average-good. We asked for a hot dog at the pool one day and waited over 45 mins. for it. Then, when we FINALLY located him, he said he \"had forgotten\" but at least we got a fresh new one in about 5 mins. and was free. But we were REALLY hungry 45 mins. ago. So however you look at it. FOOD: *The prices all over the resort are outrageous (and this comes from a Puerto Rican that grew up and lived in the island for 18 years!!). Buy stuff (INCLUDING food) outside the hotel period. Drinks at night may be ok to purchase here as prices don't vary much in clubs in Old San Juan. I wouldn't recommend eating in the hotel unless u are ready to spend some decent bucks and to eat JUST in the FINE restaurants. Don't even TRY to order food at the pool! That one time we asked the waiter for a hot dog, we also ordered \"nachos\"...the nachos ended up being chips dumped from a bag u could have bought at Walgreen's for 2 bucks and the sauce dumped from a Tostitos dipping sauce you could have gotten for $1.50 but of course, not inly it would have been cheaper f you would have walked some mere minutes to Walgreen's, but you would have gotten much more quantity, too *If you want some incredible Puerto Rican and Latin American food at bargain prices, goto *Latin Star* just a few minutes walk from the hotel (ask receptionist). Just to tell you that a plate of spaghettis Puerto Rican style; different taste from Italian!) is just $8.95 and not only I was full that dinner, but also was full with the leftovers the next day at lunch!! So much food served that u may have the option to then share with someone else. ALL the food in this rest. is incredible. I took ALL my American friends + my boyfriend on both occasions I visited the Marriott and they never got tired of it. They also thought the food was superb, as well as the service there! ENTERTAINMENT: *If you LOVE Latin music, u are in for a great treat: the lobby is incredible every single night of the week. Even when I'm just on vacation at home in Caguas I drive there on weekend or some week nights if I can just to go dancing and partying. Don't get me wrong, it is a laid-back, CLASSY \"party scene\". It's mostly adults ages 35+ at least, depending on the night. But u'll NEVER find 20-somethings around in big groups, if u know what I mean. *All the bands from every night are great and they play salsa, merengue, boleros, etc. *Another great entertainment enter is the lobby of the El San Juan Hotel. Just take a cab there on Sat. nights. Party until 5am++ INCREDIBLE. U'll see bunch of locals here too, as not only guests from that hotel go but residents of Puerto Rico gather on weekend nights just to have some fun and great dancing. The bands are even better here!! I guess that's all I remember. So in a nutshell, I don't know if I would actually stay OVERNIGHT again unless you looove the amazing view from the cabana rooms or the unbelievable bed from the tower rooms. The prices are out there for you to judge. But if you just want to experience Puerto Rico, I advise u to rent a room in a small budget hotel in the area, eat in local restaurants, and just head to the lobbies of these 2 great hotels at night to have a blast, Latin dancing all night!! =)", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "phila. pa", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed the Marriott\u201d", "Author": "LSB_Phila_Pa", "ReviewID": "UR8447624", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Marriott Aug 2-Aug 6, 2007.

It was $15 for the taxi ride from the airport to the hotel, which was around a 10-15 minute ride when not in rush hour traffic. The beach was nice; the water was beautiful but is kinda rough. Plenty of people were having a ball jumping the waves or riding boogey boards on the waves. Its definitely more for that kind of stuff as opposed to swimming. The gym was kinda small but we did get in a decent workout with weights and cardio. The cardio machines have flat screen tvs attached to them. The only negative thing is that the walls seem kinda thin. One room next door had kids. Maybe the kids were kinda loud, but there were times when we could hear their conversations...not enough to wake us however. When we checked out I left my cell phone charger in the room by accident.

For $12.00, each of us got a cheeseburger and a bag of chips, but the meal was real and delicious so we didn't mind paying. They also have other great grill type snacks. We journeyed into the casino and won a little money and also lost some. There were no big payouts for us like in Vegas, but it was still fun. The lobby lounge is a happening place in the evening with live entertainment and dancing. Above everything, I really loved the location and the view. You're close to stores (including luxury stores like Gucci and Cartier within walking distance), close to the bus line which for 75 cents will take you to historical Old San Juan and so many other interesting places, and you have that unforgettable view of the ocean.

They have superb service and excellent menu choices (creative Nuevo-Latino offerings). 8 tables are set up in the sand, under the stars with candlelight and they have maybe 10 -12 tables inside.

The Tuscany Restaurant on the ground level is one of the best Italian restaurants in San Juan - be sure to ask to be seated at a table served by Alfredo. Great health club! Leave your laptop at home, you get one hour per day of PC/Internet time in the business center per day. Cabs are cheap, figure on $12 to go just about anywhere. Cons: Food and drinks are abundant but not cheap. Average drink price is $8-10 and plan to spend ~$150 per couple on dinner with a fair bottle ($45) of wine and around $45 per couple on lunch with a beverage each. The hotel is located in town and there's a lot of construction going on around it. Some of the buildings look like they're ready to fall down and they do detract from the experience. It does look like they're trying hard to refurbish the area. Overall, it was a great vacation. We probably won't do it again but only because we'll continue to explore the islands for new and different experiences.", "Date": "July 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "pale-girl", "ReviewID": "UR8190925", "Content": "We stayed here the week of July 4th.

We had a rough time at check-in. We arrived a bit after four, which is check-in time and waited in a very long line to be told there were no rooms ready for us at that time. We were given a restaurant type pager and told to wait. We ended up wandering around a bit and having a drink at the pool bar. I really feel that Marriott should have done something for us, like comped a drink while we waited or something. We also went to speak to the concierage. Her name was Glendaly, I believe, and she was wonderful. After nearly two hours I went to inquire about getting a room and she helped us to finally get checked in. Our room was oceanfront in the remodeled tower and was fine. We were on the 6th floor and could definitely hear the lobby music until two am every night. It may be better to go higher. The elevators take FOREVER though. After check in we walked down the street and ate at an open air trattoria. The streets were very crowded and seemed safe enough to us, even after 10 pm. There was a prom at the hotel that night, and of course that was a bit annoying. The pool is small. It looks big on the hotel website, but it is tiny and totally over run with kids. There are apparently no rules prohibiting float toys so I was run over by a shamu thing that took up half the pool several times. Also, there are a lot of chairs, but many are in the shade and are lined up four rows deep. So unless you want to lay out packed like a sardine you do have to get down before noon to get a good spot. I really was not a fan of the environment down there. Tons of kids and kind of trashy people. The beach was nice. We took cabs to San Juan after being told NOT to take the bus since it has no real set schedule. The cabs were reasonable. The casino is jam packed with old locals at night. It was actually hard to move in there or get to play. We won a little bit. The lobby is packed at night. I have never seen a hotel bar so crowded. All in all I would look elsewhere if I had it to do over. The rooms were fine for our purpose, but it really seemed like more of a city hotel than a resort property, and the kids and type of people that seemed to be staying there made me uncomfortable.

We booked the cheapest room possible hoping for an upgrade since I am an elite member, but they don't give out upgrades unless you are platinum. My recommendation to everyone is book cheap and then spend $50 to get upgraded to an oceanview room with concierge access. This hotel had one of the best executive lounges I've seen. The food is great, the service is great, and the views are amazing. You can sit out on the balcony and see what seems to be the whole island. The bedrooms were of adequate size with nice balconies. The bathrooms were large as well. Elevators were quick The pools were very nice and we never had a problem getting a chair. We even went down the slide which was fun. The beach is beautiful. It was very clean and the water the perfect temp. They have \"cabana boys\" that will carry your beach loungers out to where you want them and also put up umbrellas. All included in your stay with the hotel. And you can order drinks while laying on the beach. My only complaint about the pool is that there is no gated access to get to the pool and all of the local kids would come in and kind of take over the pool. That got to be pretty annoying when we were just trying to relax at the swim-up bar and kept getting splashed. The area that it is in at first looks sketchy, but all of Puerto Rico looks like that. They have great boutiques and restaurants. Our favorite was Pure Natural next to Wendy's, an organic cafe that had amazing fresh fruit smoothies and wonderful sandwhiches.

My husband and I, along with several of our friends had a wonderful stay in San Juan. While I went to great extents to research exactly where we would stay, I had my fingers crossed and I prayed that my selection was a good one. I was pleasantly surpised to see that most of the reviews I had read on Trip Advisor were accurate. The renovated corner rooms in the tower section of the hotel are absolutely beautiful. You have two balconies, once which is ocean front and the other is either ocean or pool view. Beware of the cabana rooms as most of those are not renovated and the difference between the two (renovated and non-renovated) are like staying at the Waldorf Astoria versus Motel 6. Great pool...you even get some \"eye candy\" (pool boys) passing around fruit while you take in some rays. Excellent beach front property overall. The location of the hotel, in Condado, is ideal; close to high-end shopping (Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Cartier to name a few) are walking distance. There are also a few non-national brand boutiques that have a great selection of fashion. There is no need for a rental car, taxis are readily accesible. Old San Juan is great and is only a 12-15 minute drive from the hotel. A lot of national brand shopping mixed with other quaint boutiques. Plan to spend a day or two in Old San Juan to get everything in. El Yunque (the rainforest) is also a MUST. The drive is long, so booking through the hotel is a safe way to go - $64 (includes transportation and tour of the forest). The Barcardi tour, in my opinion, was very boring. The taxi ride from the hotel was $35 plus $5 for each additional person, $36 wait time (if you want the taxi to wait while you take the 1 hour tour) and the same price for your return. Needless to say, you are paying for the \"free\" tour in the taxi fare. However, the two free drinks and the Barcardi store are a nice compliment to the otherwise boring experience. Night life at the hotel is always jumping, but be sure to venture out to Club Babylon and some other local spots to get a true feel of Puerto Rico. Lastly, the hotel food is somewhat expensive (to be expected). So take time to venture out to some of the local restaurants in Old San Juan. There are too many to name, but just ask a few of the friendly locals or hotel staff. They were very helpful to us in finding great spots to go for a nice meal.

No major hotel, and especially one that caters to convention/business travelors should have such poor technical services in a newly renovated room.

Anyone from the street can access the elevators and there were two security situations that had to be addressed on my floor during my 5-night stay.

Having read the reviews on tripadvisor, we asked for an upgrade to a corner room...They told us oceanfront room would be $50 more/night and the corner room even more. We sighed b/c we really didn't want to spend that much and agreed only to the extra $50/night for the ocean front room. When the front desk attendant came back she said she had a nice surprise for us and gave us the corner room anyway (for $50/night) on the 18th floor. The view was gorgeous. The room has flatscreen tv, two balconies (one ocean front, one overlooking the pool), new king size bed, etc. Very nice. Also, the upgrade came with access to the executive lounge on the top floor which included free breakfast, evening snacks (which actually served as our dinner on more than one occasion), and dessert. The food was also very good up there and we almost ate enough to pay for the extra $50 upgrade.

My party (husband, my mother and my sister) and I travelled to this hotel during Memorial Day weekend and it DEFINITELY was NOT what we expected!! It was something reminiscent of Spring Break, from the EXTREMELY scantilly clothed guests (which I would get into more detail about but think it wil be best to hold back) to the loud, obnoxious drunk people in the pool, this was not what we envisioned our vacation to be. Now, my husband, sister and I are all in our 20's, laid back and like to have fun, but this was over the top. THE GOOD: To begin, check in was a breeze, and they accomodated our early check in request. The rooms have nice decor - flat screen tvs, comfy bed, they did do a nice job with the renovations. The bathrooms are nicely appointed as well - beautiful marlbe vanity with lots of space to store toiletries, etc. Even though we didnt have an oceanfront room and when you immediately looked out onto the balcony you got an ugly view of this monstrous building under construction, all we had to do was look to our left and the ocean was right there, so that was a nice perk, as well. THE BAD: The surf at this resort is SOO strong and rough you really couldnt be in the water and relax; you constantly had to watch for the next wave to come and take you under. All of the staff encouraged the guests to stay out of the water. Now, when you are in the Carribean, you want to be able to swim in the beautiful, crystal clear ocean water, and we couldnt do that here.Needless to say, we were hugely dissappointed when we discovered this, and after we saw the size of the small pool. Food/drink service on the beach was PAINFULLY slow...I understand the Carribean (been to Aruba, Bermuda and Mexico ) and that your mindset should be to relax, you are on island time thing, but we waited almost an hour for 4 drinks!! We had lunch there at LA VISTA, I believe. Food was decent, but pretty pricey. The restaurant is located right next to the pool/beach so it does have some nice scenery. Our first (and only) time we had dinner at the resort was the BBQ buffet they had beachside...it seemed like a nice idea, but after we paid 24 dollars a person for alot of unappetizing food we realized what a bad move that was. THE UGLY: We were there less than 24 hours and I had to call the front desk 3 times!!!! At 11 pm (yes, that is a bit early, but we had been traveling since 4 am) the room next to ours was outrageously loud and having a party, with a screaming baby in the room, nonetheless. They definitely need to do something about the noise levels in the guestrooms - it seemed as if you could hear everything coming from the rooms next to you and there were no sound barriers at all. The noise was unbearable and we couldnt sleep and after dealing with it for a couple of hours, we succombed to calling the front desk to complain. A few minutes later, through our peephole, we counted 10 adults leave that room. I will say that security did come up after to confirm they broke up the party. 6AM: We were woken up to about 7 girls yelling outside our door. They sounded pretty wasted. As I was calling the front desk to complain (AGAIN,) the door to the room next to ours opened and a gentleman excertingly told the girls to \"Shut up.\" The girls felt the need to respond to him with expletives I wont use, but once he went back into his room. we thought (erroneously) that this escapade was over. Boy, were we wrong. About 10 minutes later these girls returned AGAIN and this time when the guy next room over opened his doors to yell at them again, it turned into a shouting match and the girls threatening to hit him (unprovoked), etc. We watched this unravel through our trusty peephole, for to be honest, we were afraid of what might happen if we opened the door. I called the front desk for the 3rd time and told them they had a pretty serious situation on their hands on the 10th floor and they better get up here. The thing that bothered me the most about this situation was that we never, not ONCE, heard back from the front desk about this situation. They never called or came to our room to see if things had been solved.We barely got a sorry out of them for everything we had experienced our first and ONLY night here. I called up to my mothers room on the 12th floor (who had noise issues the night before, as well, but nothing compared to ours) and we would return to the InterContinental (Katherine at the beach bar rocks!!) in a heartbeat.

The builldings on both sides of the Marriott are bombed out. There was no work being done on either of those building either. Most of the neighborhood seemed more like Beiruit than a tropical paradise. The walk on the beach in either direction was no better.

Overall, the hotel was excellent, especially considering that I stayed there during the busy Memorial Day weekend. Pros: Rooms: Very good. Stayed in the tower. Be sure to ask for an upgraded room in the tower. Room had flat screen TV, bathrobe, comp bottle of water each day. Ocean or City View options were available. Food: Had a nice pool side lunch. Pool service was prompt. Very nice coffee bar handy for breakfast take-out to the beach. Staff: Very courteous! Concierge was very helpful. Complaints were handled promptly. Parking: I suggest valet parking. It didn't cost much more than the garage and the staff was prompt. Location: Very convenient. Starbucks, Walgreens across the street. Old San Juan, where most of the action is, is about 3 miles (see below) Very close to the airport. Beach access is excellent. Beach: Beach service was great, with attendant ready to set up your umbrella and chair. Of course, bring a few dollars to tip the guy. Ocean is fun, but can be a little rough for the kids. Ocean water is what you might expect, refreshing, but you are swimming next to a major, urban location! Restaurants: In the neighborhood, there is an adequate, pricey, sushi place next door. Old San Juan: Definately go to Dragonfly, Agua Viva and Parrot Club. For a great local sushi option, don't miss Jinyas, it's a drive, but worth it! Health Club: Top notch. In the basement of the old wing, this place has all of the equipment you'll need. They also provide one comp bottle of water to guests who work out. Safety: I noticed plenty of staff around, both at the pool and beach areas. While there does appear to be a high crime rate, like many urban areas, the hotel and surrounding areas felt safe to me. Jogging: Suggest an early wake-up and do the three mile (each way) jog to Old San Juan. Other: At the concierge desk, there are handy maps to most of the tourist locations with easy to follow directions from the hotel. Cons: Rooms: Be sure to stay away from the ice machine/staff entrance elevator. It tended to be noisy. A squeaky staff door was repaired promptly after I complained. Broadband: Since I was there for business, I had to use the wireless service. In the room, this service was HORRIBLE. I complained but there was absolutely nothing they could do to speed it up. There is a business center with faster service. Location: Taxis are not cheap. It was about a $12 cab ride to Old San Juan. Pool: While there are plenty of beach chairs, the pool is awkward. A huge wading pool and rather small regular pool. Probably great for kids, but not so nice for most folks. Restaurants: Avoid the gelato place down the street. It just didn't taste very fresh!! Rates: Be sure to have them explain their resort fee. This is not a problem, but it is almost automatically included on your bill. Check in: Could have been much faster. The hotel promotes express check in, but I couldn't find it. Casino: Well, maybe because I lost money. It just wasn't a pleasant place to spend the evening. Elevators: Slow, but I did stay over the busy holiday weekend.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Syracuse NY", "Title": "\u201cEverything we wanted for our Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "KevinandMichelle10", "ReviewID": "UR7700902", "Content": "The Hotel staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. They really made it seem a pleasure to serve us. We had an oceanfront view room that was beautiful. The beds were very comfy and falling asleep to the sound of the ocean was nice. The pool was great, the hot tub was nice(although it wasn't hot the first couple nights). The beach is great. They bring out chairs and umbrellas for you. The ocean is like bathwater, although you have to be careful with the waves. The drinks and food are very pricey so we ate at a place called Dannys(left out of the Marriot and down a block on the corner) and their food is very good and very inexpensive. We were a little disappointed that the swimup bar and the beach bar closed so early. The beach bar is only open until 7. The concierge was very helpful and saved us a lot of money by suggesting renting a car instead of taking a tour to the rainforest. I really can't understate how the friendliness of the staff made our stay enjoyable. As far as eating, we ate at the Cherry Blossom right next door, which is a Japanese restaurant where they cook the food right in front of you. It's very good but expensive. We also ate at Yerbe Buena(right across from Dannys) which has very good food. We ate at Dannys every day for their breakfast. Their fried egg sandwhich on a hoagie is phenomenal. There's also a place called The Burger Joint which has one of the best hamburgers we've ever had. Take a right out of the Marriot and it's only a few blocks down on your left. We got a little tired of Puerto Rican food so this place was great. The Rainforest was nice. I recommend going to the top trail with the tower. The view is spectacular. Note, when you get to the top of the first part, look for the sign that says Wildlife Viewing Area and take that trail to the tower. The other road doesn't lead to much of a view. We also went to Old San Juan and it was a lot of fun. There's a really beautiful walk that goes right by the ocean around the city. We went on the Bacardi tour which we both thought was a waste of time. It's basically two hours between travel and everything else to get two free drinks each. The rest is a big commercial for Bacardi. The location of the Marriot is great. Starbucks is right across the street and there's a Walgreens a block down for anything else you might need. If you want to find beer or wine, take a right out of the Marriot and there's a store on the left side down a few blocks which had the cheapest and widest selection. We heard a lot about how it's dangerous in Puerto Rico but we never had any problems or felt unsafe. The people there are extremely friendly and offer great advice(such as, 30 SPF suntan lotion isn't going to cut it.)

We absolutely loved it!! We stayed on the 16th floor with an ocean view room that was gorgeous. It was newly renovated and based on the receptionist at the check in window we were the 4th guest to stay in the room. The hotel was very clean and the cleaning crew was very respectful to the items we left in plain view on the dresser. Food: we ate at The Vista every morning for free due to upgrading our room from city view to ocean view....totally worth it!!! However, if we had not had the free breakfast we probably wouldn't have ate at the hotel. It was very expensive and the selection got old after a few days. However, we did try a good chicken sandwich offered by the pool bar. Drinks: The drinks served by the bar at the pool are pretty pricey and not very strong. However, if you go into the bar in the lobby they seem to taste stronger. Nightlife: We really enjoyed the fact that we did not need to leave the hotel to have a good time. While we were there they had a Brazilian night with professional dancers, a live band, salsa night and a DJ. We sat at the bar a few nights to enjoy the entertainment. Location: The area seems to be unsafe at first, but after you familiarize yourself with it it doesn't seem too bad. There is a lot of construction going on and there is not much scenary as you walk along Ashford Ave. There are a lot of conveniences along the street including Starbucks, Walgreens, Haagen Daz, and various other local restaurants. It's also a 15 minute bus ride from Old San Juan and maybe 15 minutes from the airport. The Beach: The water is beautiful...the waves are strong some days, but we were lucky to have one day when the waves were perfect....the water is clean, blue and very warm. The view isn't the greatest because of the construction going on but it was still beautiful. Pool: the pool is small and when there are a lot of kids around it doesn't seem big enough. Luckily 2 out of the 3 days we were there, we had the pool almost to ourselves! I would totally recommend this hotel for a few days stay....it was a nice way to rest and relax prior to going on our cruise.

So we headed over to the Marriott. It was beautiful. The lobby was nice. The bell men were cute and the rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Our first room had some leakage problems and we were promptly relocated (with help) and given a $100 credit. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at the hotel at all, too pricey for us. There is a great restaurant down the street with really good Puerto Rican food that is open 24 hours. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember the name of it but it is right next to Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the Ashford Ave. side. The portions are large so we either shared or took the leftovers back to the hotel. We inquired about a microwave and a few minutes later a guy was knocking on the door with a microwave to put in the room, free of charge!! After realizing all the taxi rides were going to cost a small fortune, we chose the bus. Only $.75 each way! The bus goes everywhere from Old San Juan to Isle Verde and even the airport. Old San Juan is nice and perfect for tourists. We found a little shack by the port that served the best Marlin pastelillos, the manager, Andres is really nice. We also caught the ferry over to the Bacardi plant for free drinks!!! The souvenir shops definitely weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as cheap as the Bahamas. The clubs were okay. Too many young people though. Senior Frogs has a great atmosphere but leaves something to be desired in the food department. We decided we wanted to get away from the tourist spots and wanted to rent a car. The Hertz desk at the hotel wanted $40 a day!!! So I went down to the business center which is open 24 hours a day and booked a small compact car using Hotwire for $12.95 a day. The total for the day was less than $20. The only bad thing is the $14 parking fee at the hotel is ridiculous!!! We rode the bus to the airport, picked up the car, and hit the highway. There are small tolls as you drive up the highway, the most expensive one was $1.50. We drove up to the El Yunque rainforest, which was only a 45 minute drive. The tours from area hotels range from $40-$50. So we were expecting an entrance fee of some sort. Well to our surprise it was completely FREE. We walked the trail to the La Mina waterfall. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to the peak this time, we heard it was beautiful. Either way, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat this FREE excursion. All in all we had a great trip to Puerto Rico.

I love this hotel. My king room was 1109 in the tower. I highly recommend upgrading to the \"09\" rooms. During my stay it was an additional $50 a night and well worth it. These \"09's\" are corner rooms on the ocean side. Each side of the corner has a long terrace. The view of the ocean and the city is spectacular. The decor and linens are all appropriate for the setting. The robes are comfortable. The bath products are average quality, but they provide a nice quantity. They are also very generous with the pool towels which is nice in a beach location. In general, the wireless in the room worked. However, there were times I found it to be very slow. It was $11.99/day. The in-room safely easily accomodates laptops and is easy to use. There is a small refridgerator and coffeepot (it is in the cabinet under the tv.) They also have big flatscreen tvs that swivel. The beach area is the best part of the hotel. The area is well maintained. There seemed to be plenty of chairs and umbrellas (get an umbrella early---you will want it and they run out.) The pool areas are oddly small and the chairs seem really close together. The pool itself is set up in such a way that there really isn't a lot of swimming areas. I say...stick with the beach. The service on the beach is sporadic...so if you are going to want food or drink...plan ahead and flag the guy down when you see him. The food and drink from the pool bar area was all good and the prices were fair. The property does have a lot of activities for kids. There were a lot of families with small children in the pool area and running around on the beach. If you are looking for some place really quiet or adults only...this might not be the location for you. The hotel lobby is basically a giant bar with live, festive music. There are plenty of tables and it is a good place to meet up with your group before dinner, etc. The gym in the hotel is great. There are a lot of new machines, plenty of free weights and a nice mat area. They provide towels, bottled water, etc. There is also a nice locker room with showers, etc. NOTE: If your check out is earlier than your flight you can easily store you luggage with the valet and spend more time on the beach or at the pool. The locker rooms in the gym are set up so you can easily shower, change your clothes and get ready for your flight. They encourage you to do this and there is no extra charge for using the gym facilities even after you have checked out. A couple of people from my group rented cars and getting the cars from valet during the peak periods was pretty exhausting. Old San Juan was only about 15 minutes away and a $15 fare. The airport was about 20 minutes away and an $18 fare. Cabs seemed to be plentiful and not expensive. Unless you are going somewhere far away I would recommend not renting a car and just taking cabs. This hotel is very comfortable. the location is great. It is a perfect distance between Old San Juan and the airport.

The room was spacious with a king bed, a desk & chair, a lounge chair, flatscreen TV and a safe. The bathroom was great - it had all the amenities we needed. Hotel : overall was very nice. The casino was a bit small but we only walked thru it, didn't play since we heard from others how tight the machines were. There is a bar right in the lobby so it's a nice place to people watch. It also has a small sundries store and concierge desk. We walked out to the pool which were very nice. Although there is a sign that says reserving chairs is only limited to half an hour, we never stayed long enough to see if it's enforced. The beach is okay. It can get crowded by noon so it's best to go out before that to get a chaise lounge and a good spot on the beach. The waves are pretty rough. While we were there, we saw a lot of locals body boarding and a lot of tourists getting knocked down by the waves (not badly though!). The workers there were very friendly. And everytime I called for housekeeping, they came right away to clean our room. Restaurant : we only ate at one. It was the noodle bar tucked in the corner of the casino. We were craving noodles and it definitely hit the spot...although be expected to pay a lot more than at your usual local joint! Location : is okay. If you're walking along the beach and look back, it may not look like \"paradise\" with a lot of run-down buildings and construction going on. But on the street, it seems better. There is a Starbucks right across the street (Haggen Daaz is coming soon!) and Walgreens right at the corner. If you're coming out of the hotel and turn left, there is a little strip mall area across the street. Try eat at the restaurant that sells gelato. I had a chicken sandwich there which was very good. Various : this Marriott is only about 15 mins away from Old San Juan. Instead of taking a taxi there, we took the city bus (I believe it's B21, but double check with the front desk) which turned out much cheaper. Each way was $0.75 compared to the $14-$16 we'd have to pay for a taxi! It may take a few minutes longer but it's a great way to see the city. :) Along the lines of taxi's, the rate for 2 of us plus 2 luggage from San Juan airport to the Marriott hotel was $16.

We booked our trip late, so we had to take what we could get. I knew going in it was going to be like two different vacations for us. I've also posted a review for the Westin. My first impression of the Marriott was not good. When I walked in the doors, the smell of stale smoke (probably wafting from the casino) hit me in the face. Our room was OK, nothing special, ocean front. I felt it was a little run down. The balcony was great to watch the ocean and the surfers, but it was not inviting. It was cement and nothing cozy about it. The beach was nice and was the main attraction for my boys, ages 5 and 7. They would still be in the surf if we didn't have a real life to get back to. My biggest gripe about the beach is that it was filthy. I don't understand why people think the beach is just one big ashtray!!!!!!! It is filthy and disgusting. And people leave lots of other garbage also. We were there for 6 nights (had to add 2 nights on due to weather back here in NY) and I only saw the beach comber tractor out there a total of 2 times. That was in the morning, but not even early enough because people were already out there on lounge chairs and he had to drive around those people. Here's a thought : Get that thing out there earlier and clean that beach every day. It really got to me, can you tell? OK, walking down the beach: well -- when you stand back and look back at the hotel, you definitely do not get that caribbean island feel. There are what looks like bombed out buildings on either side of the hotel. My advice is to keep your back to the hotel and stare at the ocean. We took a lot of walks down the beach and there are local people there that hang out but that wasn't a problem. There is a -- how shall I say -- a same sex hotel down to the right of the hotel. Luckily my boys were focused on the ocean and I didn't have to field any questions. Men playing volleyball on the beach in speedos --- an image burned in my brain. I'll leave it at that. (not that there's anything wrong with that) After being at the Westin and feeling a little isolated, it was nice to be able to walk out of the hotel and go to Walgreens and get stuff we needed. Or try some local food, which I was determined to do. We ate at a restaurant called Ikakos, within walking distance. We had a very good experience there. The conch fritters were awesome, the conch cocktail amazing. The mofongo with seafood --- WOWEE! It was so good we got take out from there the next night too. I had conch in half an avocado also which was good. Also had it a few day s later and noticed it was a bit different. The first time was on a weekend, so maybe they have different chefs for during the week. The concierge -- Oh brother! I kept getting this one girl, let's just say her name started with a G and ended with a Y. She was very bad at her job. The last straw was when she told that yes, the caves are open today. We drove an hour and a half and guess what? The caves were closed. Sometimes they close for wet weather. However , this was a sunny Tuesday. The problem then? They are closed Sun through Tuesday!!!!!! Shouldn't the concierge of a busy hotel know that?????? After our 3 hour drive and a very upset crying 7 year old, I marched straight to the manager. She was polite. We wound up with free breakfast the next morning. There were other things with her also, too long to write. I wanted a small fishing excursion, something light for the boys. She pretended to look for something and said she would get back to me. Never did. I found this guy on my own who took just the 4 of us on the lagoon and we saw all the iguanas we wanted and then fished for tarpon. I don't think I can post his web address, but contact me and I will be glad to give it to you. i highly recommend him. the kids loved it and wanted to go back the next day! After 4 nights here I did long for the resort atmosphere of the Westin, but we booked the extra two nights here b/c we did not feel like moving again. They were able to accommodate us and sent up wine and cheese, which was nice. We never visited the casino nor did we care to. This hotel seems to be popular for cruise ship people to spend a night or two on the way to their cruise or after. I saw a lot of older couples. But there was a fair amount of children also. The safety issue? It wasn't an issue. As a matter of fact, there was a woman who could not find her 14 year old son while they were waiting for their room. She was a mess and security was all over it. Turns out he had moved from the lounge chair she told him to stay in, crossed to the other side of the pool and put a towel over his head. I think she aged a few years but my point is security took it very serious and they were the people who eventually found him under the towel. I probably would not stay at this hotel again.

We arrived at 2pm and left the next morning at noon. There is no shuttle service to the hotel, which is probably 20 minutes from the airport. Exiting in the SJ airport, there appears to be a single cab company - or single tourism company that manages the cabs. They are in a little kiosk as soon as you exit the airport and they write up your itinerary (for the cab driver) and tell you the fare. Then you line up and get in a cab when it is your turn. Cab fare to the hotel for 4 of us with 4 suitcases and a golf bag was $18.50USD. The hotel has a tall tower, maybe 20 floors, and then a 4-5 floor high wing (the \"cabana\" rooms). We requested a low floor in the tower because we had heard that the tower rooms had been renovated already but the cabana rooms had not. We were put in a tower room on the 18th floor, overlooking the pool and the ocean. The room was nicely decorated and clean, and had a new flat screen tv. The beach in this area has tan/brown sand. The water is bright blue/green. The pool at the resort is very nice and has a little water slide and swim up bar. They are obviously trying very hard to be a resort. The problem is that the area surrounding the hotel beachfront is all either graffitied and run-down, or under construction. Maybe eventually it will get cleaned up but we were really not enticed to walk along the beach, for example. This does not stop them from having resort prices. Our room was about $400 for the night (+/- tax) for a single room with two double beds. Hamburgers at the pool grill were $12, a bottle of corona was $5. The Vista restaurant in the hotel offered a lunch buffet for $22 per person and a breakfast buffet for $17. We did not do either and didn't even check the dinner prices. Out on the street side of the hotel you are within easy walking distance of a starbucks, walgreens, dunkin donuts, wendy's, and subway - in addition to several little local joints.

The beach you could see construction and workers and an ugly bldg. next door- but the chairs are a plenty and they carry them out for you! The best thing to do is go to the beach until around 1 or 2 and then go to the pool for lunch and the rest of the afternoon.

CD player in room would have been nice as would have been a better television (I did not use the television). In-hotel restaurants are fair at best. The Italian restaurant, is particularly mediocre given its $20+ entrees. Stick with the more casual dining option (La Vista).

No vegetable other than root vegetables (plantains, cassava, yucca) could be found in the \"local\" restaurant offerings. Migas (dinner), while exhibiting a beautiful modern decor (and stunning marble or alabaster bar lit from below), presented sculptural but uninspiring food -- salt seemed to tb the preferred flavoring.

There is a Hertz rental counter, a tour desk and a self-laundry at the hotel. There are several bars and restaurants. The Marriott lobby is large and open with a bar at the center. On Saturday night there was a nice band playing Latin music. The bar was crowded and there were a lot of people dancing. To the right of the lobby is the casino.

I really recommend this because my colleagues' rooms were terribly shabby, but the new ones are very nicely appointed, if a bit on the small side. I also had a corner room which had a gorgeous view of the pool, beach and city (at an additional cost of course). I enjoyed my stay until day four when construction started around 8:00am in a room near mine. The noise was like a small jack hammer that could not be escaped, even with earplugs. I politely asked to move rooms but was told there were a lot of people coming in that day and to check back later in the day. The situation was handled very poorly and I am following up for partial credit on the room because they never moved me and construction started early the next morning. Besides this pretty major glitch, the rest of the experience was nice: pretty public areas, great pool and beach. One thing that you should note when reserving is that the price of the hotel does not include a $25 tax + $22 resort fee. We were part of a group so it was not clear whether this was to be expected but that seems like a significant addition on top of an already high room rate if you're not expecting it. The hotel is a $12. cab ride away from Old San Juan, which is postcard beautiful and has some really great restuarants. We enjoyed several including Baru which had great food (sit outside) and Amadeus, which had a great ambiance with live Spanish music and a great menu that includes excellent seafood. I also suggest starting off your night at the upstairs bar at El Convento (beautiful little hotel) and a post-dinner walk on Paseo de la Princesa. PR is beautiful and the people were extremely warm. It's impossible not to fall in love with this city. I will certainly return but hopefully to a much quieter room. One last note: our group was taken to the phosfourescent lagoon in Fajardo.

The staff was very accomodating and helpful too! The resort was very clean. My room was always spotless. Great towl art too. Not to mention, leave the cleaning crew a tip from time to time and they are very appreciative. - Great bellman service, etc. - Good workout facilities and great massage rooms/massages.

We stayed for 4 nights in a poolside/oceanview, nonsmoking room on the 10th floor. Overall, it was a beautiful hotel, but there were some problems. First of all, check-in was a nightmare. I was not told before I arrived that there was an additional deposit if you use a debit card instead of a credit card. I went to prepay for my room, but the front desk clerk stated I would have to pay an additional $250 dollars that I did not have. I asked for the manager, and he acted as is he didn't know anything. Eventually, my friend and I paid cash for the room for the first night just to get settled in. The next day was also a bit frustrating because of the deposit requirement. The day manager was willing to work with us; however, she called my room at about 7:00 o'clock in the morning to ask about my credit card, which I thought was VERY rude. Second, there was a small drip coming from the ceiling in the bathroom. The first engineer came and wiped off the ceiling, and told the manager it was condensation. The second engineer said the same thing. Eventually, there were about four different maintenance engineers sent to my room before it was resolved. Third, the water in the bathroom never actually got hot. It was just warm, and I really don't like to take warm showers and baths. They also ran out of washcloths by my second night. NEVERTHELESS, I voiced my concerns to the manager upon checkout and requested to be compensated for the inconveniences. He refunded the cash price I paid for the first night including the resort tax and fees. Overall, I can say this was a pretty nice hotel. I was not excited by the location because it was in a neighborhood that is currently being renovated. There are several other large hotels being torn down, built up or rebuilt, and the construction took away from my view. But the rooms in the Marriott were clean. The rest of the staff was friendly, and the beds were very soft. The pool area was beautiful. It included a waterslide, and the beach was nice; however, the gates to the beach close at about 6:00 pm, and you have to go out to the street if you want access to the beach in the evening. On the weekends, there are live bands that play in the lobby, and they serve food and drinks; but there is also a two-drink minimum and the food is just O.K. The casino was O.K., but I did not see one person really win anything. All guests have 24-hour access to the business center, which includes a daily 1-hour free pass to use the internet and printer. Guests also receive a complementary bottle of water daily, and free access to the fitness center. I was able to borrow an umbrella the day it rained, and the guys working at the Concierge and Rental Car booths were very nice. My suggestions when it comes to staying here: Take the bus when possible. Request a higher floor because of the house band, but not too high because of the construction. Have an open mind, be flexible and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the small stuff ruin your vacation. Bring a lot of money because things got a bit pricey at times, and study some basic words in Spanish because there are still a lot of people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak English. Also, buy water, toiletries and additional film at the Walgreens down the street, and make sure you spend at least one day sightseeing in Old San Juan. If I ever go back to San Juan, I will most likely stay at another property in Isla Verde instead of Condado because of the nightlife. We spent at least $30 dollars a day on taxis going back and forth between Isla Verde or Caroline and Condado. Although there were some decent nightclubs and restaurants near the Marriott in Condado, most of the popular ones were located in the other areas.

We were paying for 2 nights of the vacation ourselves and redeeming 2 nights through Marriott rewards points. Our redemption points were only for a cityview room, but the clerk allowed us to stay in the same room all four nights (the 2 nights we paid for were in a club-level ocean front corner room). We were thrilled by that - we had not wanted to change rooms, and that was a significant upgrade. Our room wasn't ready until 4:00 but they gave us a pager and we hung out in the lobby. The rooms do need upgrading, but hey, that's what they're doing for the next few months, so we knew what to expect. The corner room was large and had two magnificant balconies. The bed was very comfy. The beach was awesome. I don't know why someone said the beach was \"small\" - they're crazy!! It is HUGE! Very deep beach, with Hawaii-like sand (very soft and thick granular) and Gulf of Mexico water (even though you're on the Atlantic side, the water is green/blue and very clear). The waves were nice - big enough to give you a thrill, but no nasty undertow. I did hear the water gets pretty rough on this side of the island in the winter. The lounge chairs and umbrellas were a nice touch. The pool was nice; one pool is only 2 feet deep for the kiddies, but I found the beach to be the main attraction anyway. We ate at La Vista - not horribly expensive, typical $12 resort burgers. A decent meal. I recommend walking out of the hotel and going left to eat. (There wasn't much to the right except a Wendy's.) As mentioned in other reviews, Yerba Buena was FANTASTIC! A must-eat! The casino - ho hum. Just not really that exciting. There was only one craps table and it was the deadest, most devoid of life thing we've ever seen. The dealers didn't seem to really know the rules either. We had fun playing roulette, but most people there play slots or blackjack. Low-limit tables were nice ($2 roulette). The casino is expanding another 2,000 square feet to add penny and nickel slots. People complaining about the casino being smoky - have you ever been in a casino that WASN'T smoky?!?! We had been excited to stay in a hotel with a casino, being gamblers, but we didn't spend much time in this one. Also they do not give free drinks to the players! On that note, the club level lounge doesn't have free booze either. I was surprised by this - I thought this was the point of club level!? They have this \"honor bar\" system where you can get booze between 5:30 and 7:30 and you write down your name and what you bought and it gets charged to your bill. Drinks were pricey ($6.75 for a local beer). And wouldn't you know it, someone wrote down our name and charged alcohol to our room that we didn't drink and we had to get them to take it off the bill. (You are supposed to sign in every time you use club level. I think someone got our name off the signin sheet and wrote it on the alcohol sheet. Moral of that story - don't bother signing in). The desserts and breakfast in club level were very nice, though. This is a hotel where you definitely want to stay so that you can see the ocean. The other side ain't nothing to look at. I would not stay in the cabana rooms - the tower is the only way to go (after it's done in 2007!). The cabana rooms looked to be much lower quality than the tower rooms and have limited views of the water, even if you are on the ocean side.

It was a small wading pool that could get very crowded and noisey at peak times (especially when the 20 somethings were drinking heavily and playing volley ball). We found that the hotel was mostlyfrequented by younger couples in their 20's and 30's, singles, business travlers, and some young families (we had two 19 year olds with us.) Our room directly overlooked the ocean so that was a nice treat. Make sure to ask where to go when heading out to the restaurants. Danny's International for breakfast was good, but the breakfast buffet at the hotel was a good value too. Other restuarants were recommended by friends and travlers but they didn't turn out to be as good as the hotel's recommendations. The cataraman snorkling trip was really fun, but the bus ride to get to the boatyard took 2 hours going and 1.5 hours returning!

You get the distinct feeling that you are at an average, borderline run-down, Marriott in central New Jersey, it doesn't feel like a resort at all. This hotel needs work in every respect.

The shower head was at my shoulder, like 2 feet below a regular shower head. I have never seen anything like that! But, we were there for the beach and sun. However, when we got outside, we were disappointed. The pool is small and shallow. One half of the pool is a little deeper, but there is a volleyball net there, which takes up the entire pool with the net and crazy kids playing, so forget that! You need to hang out in the 2 foot side of the pool. They never opened the swim up bar during our 4 day stay. The beach was short and the water was too rough to hang out. There were big waves and lots of locals with full surf boards and boogie boards, so beware you might get hit when they come crashing down. The waves weren't huge, but you couldn't relax out there, you needed to be alert so you could dive under the waves, or get knocked down. They did have a lot of chairs on the beach and attentive waiters though. They charge way too much money for what they deliver + resort fee. Positives: close to the airport and old san juan. However, I don't think Old San Juan is as quaint as everyone claims. It has like 2 cobblestone streets and everyone acts like it's Europe. It is about 30% gentrified. There are some nice, trendy NY-style restaurants littered between shops that sell random trinkets not from Puerto Rico, We saw lots of shops selling stuff from India, China, and Africa. I recommend Marmalade and Dragon Fly, good food, fun, and fancy drinks. I also recommend going to another hotel!", "Date": "May 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cOld rooms, nice views!\u201d", "Author": "CanadianMag", "ReviewID": "UR5025796", "Content": "I paid $110 a night for this room on priceline.

Unlike Starwood brand hotel, I have consistently received 5-star service no matter what brand I stay in. For Starwood, I have only found this type of service in their W brand hotels. So, although I found the service at the Marriott to be exceptional as usual, there were a few problems that I faced with my room. First, I purchased an oceanview/pool room on the Internet. Since this and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were the only options I was offered, I assumed this provided the view of the ocean I wanted. Wrong. I discovered when I arrived that there also was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oceanfront room,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but since it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given as an option on the Internet. Since they were completely booked, it took a couple of days before they could move me to a room that provided a view of the ocean. So remember, oceanfront, not oceanview. Now a word about those rooms. I was place in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cabana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd section, which is where the hotel plans to place people when they begin their renovations in June. These rooms provide a direct, beautiful view of the ocean IF you are on the 6th floor or higher ( I was first place on the 4th floor and then moved to the 7th.) Anything lower than 6th provides you with a view of the palm trees that rise from built-in planters sprinkled throughout the pool area. (I included photos) Whoever designed the pool area should have realized the trees would grow. My view from the 4th floor was like looking at the ocean through a tropical forest. And believe me, I saw more forest than ocean. I'm speaking of the \"cabana\" section only. I don't know what the view is from the towers. So be warned, excellent customer service from everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maid, bellman, parking attendants, manager, concierge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t congratulate them enough, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oceanview Cabana section\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd actually means \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forest view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unless you are on the sixth floor or higher. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth a phone call to ask. Also, Puerto Rico is in the mist of a fiscal crisis. The government runs out of money on Monday, May 1st unless the Puerto Rico Congress approves a loan to carry them through the two months remaining in the fiscal year. No money means all government employees will be furloughed. On Friday, April 28 about 50,000 people protested in Old San Juan, which is where the government offices are. Because of this, cab drivers were not taking anyone into Old San Juan. I believe buses were going to the area, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure. So, you may want to check to see what the current political situation before you go. Trust me, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not limited to the Old San Juan area. On the morning I left, at approximately 6:30 a.m. someone parked a truck loaded with HUGE speakers and started broadcasting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loud\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd music and political slogans. When I say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loud,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not talking about young men driving down the street loud, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m taking CIA/FBI blasting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loud\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that they use to disorient criminals. So check. For food try Latin Star, which is right next to the Walgreens. Great food and great prices (about $10 bucks). I went for a walk and found La Patisserie de France, a great french bakery with a latin twist. Breakfast of eggs, ham, toast, butter and jelly, french toast, potatoes and the best coffee in the world for about $5 bucks. They have different breakfast specials each morning. 1500 block of Ashford.

I have stayed at top notch hotels much more expensive than this and the service here was much better. They lost one of our bags at the airport and it was waiting in our room when we arrived back from dinner that night. Due to the wine we walked right past it and fell asleep only to notice it the next morning with a message of its arrival (also unnoticed the previous night) on the phone. My son fell and scraped his knee so I called for a band aid. They sent a guy to our room with a big old medical bag to assess the situation and \"treat\" the injury with an antibiotic spray and band aid. Our requests for extra towels were met promptly. Out by the pool the staff would remind us of the kids activities that were about to start in case we lost track of time. On the beach we were looking around at the sea of chairs late one morning and a staff came up and asked if we needed help setting up our chairs (they are heavy and it was hot and kids, etc.) So he basically did the whole set up for us including digging a big hole with a shovel for the huge umbrella we also needed. He did not hesitate to run back and get us two more beach towels and run our drink order in to the beach bar. Someone else promtly brought the drinks over to us. All the waitstaff seemed to be experienced in anticipating needs. At the brreakfast even though it was a buffet, our waiter would offer to get a waffle or omlet or whatever for us if there was a bit of a line. Coffee and juice were served almost mmediately when you sat down. Great buffet by the way. They had all the healthy stuff (huge cut up fruit bar, hot cereal, homemade yogurt bagels w/ lox and the trimmings, cold cereal) and all the less healthy stuff (omlet bar, waffels, pancakes, french toast, bacon, potatos, etc.) with a huge bread/muffin spread to boot. The concierge made great recommendations for restraunts (try the Parrot Club and Ropa Vieja for dinner) and made the reservations. Tuscany restraunt was ok but not fabulous. My dish was salty. The Lobby and all common areas were well appointed with marble and brass and spotlessly maintained. The rooms however were your standard Marriott rooms and showed a little wear around the edges. The bathroom was clean but you could tell it was definately not new, which can be a bit unsettling for some discriminating travellers like myself. However the bed was great and bed linens looked new. Overall, the staff seemed happy that we were there and eager to help, but not in a just-trying-to-get-a-tip way. Also, even though the forcast was for partly cloudy with a chance of rain the weather was a perfect 85 and sunny all 5 days we were there! My kids loved the pool and the slide and spent the whole day there. The pool was well maintained but a little on the cold side for me. I also liked the live music poolside on the weekend.

Do not pay for the hotel package trip to the factory, you can do it on your own, by taking the B21 bus to down town San Juan ( stop right outside the Marriot), get off at the last stop down and walk down the hill- turn right to Pier #2 and take the Ferry over for .50 cents. Oh! the bus is .75 cents. make sure and have exact change (No bills). When you get off the ferry, take a right towards a blue building, there will be taxi drivers there that will take you to the Bacardi factory for 3.00....much less than the hotel tour. Coming back, you have to pick up the B21 bus at the terminal to Condado. The hotel stay was great. Very busy and crowded on the weekends, with the locals, who love to dance, so this was entertaining. The staff was pleasant and the concierge was always helpful. Everything is as stated in previous posts. Starbucks across the street with free Wi-Fi. Walgreen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right down the street for Misc. stuff like juices and water...Too expensive at the hotel. Be warned that if you will not be using the pool towels, and free water, you do not have to accept the 10% resort fee. The hotel tries to cater for business folks, so the fee is not mandatory, if you are not using all of their services. What else...the food was expensive so if you are on a budget, their are some reasonable American places, Burger King, Uno's etc. We slept most of the time, and got up late, so these were savers for us for dinner. Then we had a nice dinner at Ajili M\u00c3\u00b3jili, but it was way overprice and the food was noting to write home about. Old San Juan was very nice to visit and walk around and window shop,,,, the prices were not very attractive, since they cater for people visiting on the cruise ships. However, there were plenty of restaurants down town. The cab is $12.00 per trip. We visited the La Plaza American mall...very huge...$12.00 one way in a cab..you can take the same B21 bus, but it take an hour on the bus, as oppose to $12.00 in the cab ( depends on your fancy and time constraints).

We stayed at this hotel from Jan 21-27th. Our check in took less than 5 minutes, room was average size and very clean. No issues with the water pressure or room service. Our room was cleaned everyday by 10am and the hotel staff was very friendly. House keeping usually came back in late evening for the turndown service. Lobby does get VERY crowded on the weekends and that is mainly because they have a live band and even getting out of the lobby can be a chore. You will see lots of people dancing and it was fun to watch. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that hotel really should be listed as CAT 6 but it was not bad at all. They have 2 swimming pools and the swim up bar is only opened on the weekends; they never have people available to open the slide on time and they close is before time. The beach was nice and clean and the hotel staff was always available to find chairs for us. Be ready to pay a lot of $$ for drinks and food both inside and outside the hotel. The hotel has a great location and there are tons of good places to eat. Two places that we highly recommend are Yerba Buena (Sp?), Miros (make a left at the Walgreens light and walk 2 blocks) . Walgreens was a life saver for water, snacks, beach stuff etc. There is a starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Wendys, Subway just a little walking distance away. We did not rent a car because parking is a big problem and the hotel will charge you 14 bucks per day to park. There is a Hertz counter in the hotel itself and we rented a car for a day to visit the rainforest. If you are taking the rainforest tour, make sure that take you to the La Mina falls (most tours don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coz it is a 30 min easy hike). The hike is well worth it coz it the most refreshing dip you will have. We took a snorkeling tour, the bus comes and picks you up right from the hotel and it was great way spend the day. We went to Old San Juan a couple of times and always took the bus for 75 cents. We did the Bacardi and the Fort tours ourselves and in my opinion taking the tour would not be worth it. For the Bacardi tour, take the bus to Old San Juan and walk over to the Ferry terminal, take the ferry for 50 cents and take a $3 cab ride from the other side to the distillery. Your room will have a copy of Que Pasa magazine and it is very helpful. It has a great detail about the walking Tour of Old San Juan and also had a rating for the restaurants in the hotel area. I recommend reading the walking tour if you plan to visit the forts yourself.

Coming from the northeast, it was no rougher than I'm used to, and much warmer. Overall, San Juan is OK. After a couple of days, you feel like you've seen most of what it has.

Went Dec 17-20. Here's my two cents. San Juan isn't exotic; it's a U.S. territory after all. It's like Miami--i.e.Coach, Radio Shack, BK, Wendy's--but ten times better. Beautiful mountain views. Amazing sculptures and sites hidden downtown. The rain forests are cool, but you won't see exotic animals or flowers really. Yogi, the hotel guide though is awesome. Do NOT pay the hotel for the Bacardi tour. $35/pp. Instead pay 75 cents for the bus (went up 50 cents)to Downtown San Juan (last stop from the hotel). Walk to Pier #2 ( like a 2 min walk from the bus stop). Take the ferry for 50 cents. Once you're off the ferry, walk to the right and you will see a white building. There are van drivers there who will take you to the factory for $3/pp. With all the money you save, you can buy some Bacardi Rum. The tour is lame, but they have this $50 bottle of Bacardi you can only buy at the factory and no where else in the world. As far as food goes, avoid the Latin Star with your life (it's a few blocks past Walgreen's). Definitely eat at Buena ? I don't speak Spanish, but however you say \"Green Grass\". That place is two blocks up when you walk out of the hotel to the left. AMAZING food! The hotel was nice. Very fancy lobby. Live salsa music at night. We checked in quickly and only had to wait 15 minutes upon check out. Our rooms was cleaned by 9am. Must have been because we were on the 17th floor. The staff was super friendly. Always opened car doors and the hotel door and offered suggestions. They even upgraded our room for free. We had an amazing room (#1717). It was a little small, but man the view was killer. We had TWO balconies--one facing downtown, with a huge construction crane working on a new hotel, blech!, and a view of the ocean. The view of the ocean was breathtaking. Our room also included an awesome FREE breakfast buffet at the Vista (reg price $17/pp.) If you book through the Marriot site directly, it seems most rooms come with this standard. Read the fine print to be sure. Ours just said free breakfast which we assumed was going to be some crappy bagels. Needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised. We ate belgium waffles, made to order omelets, pancakes, sausages, muffins, smoked salmon, mangoes, pineapple, etc. And we just tipped $5 every day. It was great. The casino was a little small, but still fun. Every day before dinner, we went in to play roulette for 10 minutes for dinner money and every night we won $75-175. It was awesome. So every dinner was free. I will say the wait staff at the casino s---, I had to wait forever for my Bacardi and Diet Coke every single time. My last thought, do not leave without eating the fried food downtown from the street vendors. It rocks and for $1.25 it can't be beat.

After one night in that room, we realized that it was not going to work for us through the whole trip, and they transferred us to a pool view room at no extra charge. It probably wouldn't have been possible later in the week because the resort got much more crowded, but it was good that they were able to accomodate us. The new room was a standard room, nothing extremely fancy, but sufficient. The A/C in this room worked and we still had a soft mattress which was improved by a bedboard. Startdard amenities in the room, although the reports of clogged showeer drains in other reports was true for us as well. We spent most of our time either on the beack or in the casino. The beach was relatively clean, and the only negative was that it got _extremely_ crowded towards the end of our stay and if you did not get out there before 10am, you would have trouble finding a chaise lounge. It seemed like a lot of people staked their claim early with towels on a chair and then went back to bed, which was a bit annoying. But, after a bit of searching, the staff always were able to find a chair for us. Incidentally, there is a hotel next door under construction, and if you came late, you got lunked down right in front of it, which made relaxing a bit more challenging. The casino is relatively small, with probably 10-20 tables for cards, and a couple of roulette and craps tables each and a bunch of slots. The dealers were generally fun and friendly, which made our hours at the blackjack tables (the $5 tables were usually pretty crowded but you could get in eventually) entertaining.

Our poolside drink waiter said, \"Happy hour special is two-for-one beers, from 4-7pm, but with me, you get the special all day!\" Whether or not everyone gets the special all day, he made us feel special. The area is great for walking - we ate very well. Start walking toward Old Town and hail the bus - we got it to stop for us between stops, but YMMV. You can pay $8 for a taxi, or $0.25 apiece for the bus. Your choice. Favorite nearby restaurants: If there's just one thing you do while you're in Puerto Rico, get breakfast at La Bombonera in Old Town San Juan. It's a bakery with a diner-style seating area and counter. It's so yummy, inexpensive, and genuine, it makes me want to come back just for that. Get the weekend buffet at Ajili Mojili, or an elegant dinner for two there. There was a mexican/puerto rican restaurant next door to Ropa Vieja Restauarant that we absolutely loved. We sat and watched the surf on the rocks as we ate. The Marriott looks like it would be great for families, and although there were lots of kids around the pool area, we as a newlywed couple didn't seem to mind so much.

We arrived Thursday night and took a cab from the hotel (flat rate of $12 plus tip) and it only took 10 min to get there. We got a room with an ocean view, which was great. The bad thing is that they are renovating most rooms so there are workers outside your room. We only saw the workers once during our stay. They have a good casino but I thought it was kinda small. They have a live band on the weekends and they play great salsa music! The restaurants are good too!! La Vista has great food (an awesome dessert bar for $8) and Tuscany has good seafood. La Vista has a breakfast buffet which was pricey ($17.95) but they had a good selection of food. There are bunches of restaurants right by the restaurant so most of the time we ate outside the hotel. If you turn right or left on Ashford (the hotel street), there are good places to eat and reasonable prices. The beach is a couple steps from the pool area and it was great. There are 2 pools- one for kids and another regular one with a slide. The pool area is kept clean. We went on one tour- $77 for the catamaran/snorkeling excursion. That was amazing!!! It is for one full day but definitely worth the price. Transportation and a great lunch with drinks are provided. You can book tours with the tour desk by the gift shop inside the hotel. Overall our experience was great and the weather was perfect. Take the bus to Old San Juan (25 cents, catch the B21 bus about 1 block from the hotel on Ashford) and walk around- good shopping and great places to eat.

The hotel is in a great location. It is a short distance from the airport, and within walking distance of restaurants with local flair as well as Pizza Hut, Fudruckers, Wendy's, Burger King, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, etc. Having a Walgreens across the street is also key for snacks and drinks. The pool area is really pretty and the kids loved it. There were plenty of lounge chairs, however, a limited number had access to direct sunlight for long periods of time. The beach is great too. The sand is free of rocks and shells and the water had very little seaweed. There were also plenty of beach chairs available. The outdoor beach side bar had a great view of the ocean. The drinks and food were a little expensive ($8.50 for a Margarita/$11 for a chicken ceasar salad)but so convenient. The food and drinks were pretty expensive everywhere in the hotel. Keep in mind that during the off season, the swim-up bar is only open on weekends - we wished it was open everyday! Now for the downside, the Marriott is undergoing an extensive renovation that will last for another year (per a hotel employee). Right now they are re-doing the outside so you see and hear the constuction as you sit by the pool or by the beach. They plan to renovate the rooms within the next year too. This is a step in the right direction, because the room was a basic hotel room, with basic amenities. The best part of the room was the water pressure in the shower and the powerful hairdryer - both rareties. They also plan to expand the casino. There is also a lot of construction in the area surrounding the hotel which was not always pleasant to look at. I would definitely consider going back - especially after the construction is completed.

Overall, it was an excellent experience. I am a native of the island, but haven't been back in many years, and this was the 1st time that instead of staying with family, I stayed at a hotel, and enjoyed the island with minimal family visits. I am fluent in Spanish; my friend does not speak Spanish at all. We booked an Ocean Front room, and at first were disappointed that, unlike many other tripadvisor.com guest, our resort fee wasn't waived. Our room was pleasant, and we have an excellent chamber maid named Marcia, who not only was very good, but gave us a beautiful flower arrangement a few days before we checked out. The beds were nice. Mine was a little on the soft side, but I got used to it and enjoyed it. High speed internet access fluctuates throughout the day (probably based on usage of others), but it was a minor inconvenience. Our room included breakfast, and by the end of the 1st week we knew all the restaurant staff by name. They were great, and made breakfast a lot of fun for us. We dined at Tuscany once, and it wasn't bad at all, however for $140 I expected a little better, but that might be the New Yorker in me talking. The room service menu was unusually boring, but luckily we only did that once, because of a lack of energy to go out one night. We rented a car for this trip because of meetings we had in Ponce and other points far away. Parking at the hotel was easy, and on weekends we found ourselves on the higher floors but that was no big deal. The cabbies congregate on the B level and have some benches set up; stop and listen in one day as they pontificate on all matters of life and death. Negotiate your cab fare before leaving the hotel, or any other point on the island. All the cabs have meters, and not a single time did we see one turned on. The concierge staff was knowledgeable and friendly, except one, and I wish I could remember her name. She was more focused on finishing her conversation with a coworker than helping me. But I turned to another staffer there and got what I needed, and made a complaint, which seemed to be addressed immediately. Getting to Old San Juan from this hotel is super easy--walk down the block to the right, take the B21 bus for 25 cents, and you are there in a few minutes....that is, after waiting forever for the bus to come. A cab will cost $10-$12, so the wait and price are worth it. If you are a coffee lover, have a great cup of cafe con leche at la Bombonera on Calle San Francisco (have it with a piece of flan while you're at it). I have been going there since a child. I also highly recommend the Parrott Club in Old San Juan for dinner (on La Fortuleza, near several other chic dinner spots). The spa and exercise room staff were really great. Very friendly and very open to sharing places to go and see. Daniery was my masseuse and also did a pedicure for me. She is very nice. Practice some Spanish first before you see her. My feet never looked so good. My room came with a balcony which was closed due to renovation. I got 5,000 Marriott points for each night there because of this, which was worth it. A quick trip on the elevator downstairs gave me all the fresh air I needed. Nightlight at the hotel was fun. For example, Wed - Sun had live bands, and they were all excellent. I didn't stay to dance there, but would have 1 or 2 drinks and the energy and music put me in the right mood to go out and look for trouble and the local clubs. Weekends really fill up there at night, especially in the casino. Doormen were polite and quick to get us taxis (for nights we planned on drinking). If you are traveling with kids, there are plenty of kid-friendly restaurants. Sizzler is a long walk or short cab ride away. Chilli's isnt a long walk at all. Pizza Hut seemed a little greasy, but was only a block from the hotel, as was Wendy's. Venture a little further down Ave Ashford and you will find Fudruckers and Pizza Uno....I avoided most of these, as I can eat all that garbage here in NYC. I wanted good, local food. Walk over to Ajili Mojili for a great dinner, very puerto rican. My advice--just walk up and down Ave Ashford your first day there, get to know the area, and grab a paper copy of all the locally owned restaurant menus. In summary, I highly recommend this hotel. The staff were very friendly, very helpful, and quick to our service. My buddy had no trouble speaking only English to the staff.

We used Priceline to get our rooms and got a really great rate, but unlike other hotels where I've use Priceline, the hotel staff treated us as if we were any other full paying guests. They gave us a rollaway bed for free and put us on the 19th floor with an ocean front view. The room had standard Marriott decor and was fairly large, though we did have a bit of a squeeze with the rollaway. The beds were super comfortable... as good or better than the Westin Heavenly Bed. The bathroom was a decent size, but might be a problem if you had 4 adults in one room. The balcony was nice, with a great view of the city and the ocean.

The rooms are due for an updating, but not in a 1950's sort of way. The beds, bathroom, tv are all high quality. There is a massive construction project on the west side of the building that isn't so much fun to look at, but that will be done in a few months. This is all eclipsed by the good points of the hotel. The beach is fantastic (many hotels in San Juan have sub-par beaches) - the two level pool has a swim up bar, a fun slide, plenty of chairs and wireless internet all over (included in your \"resort fee\" - which I do consider just bad business, but everyone is doing it.) The casino is adequate, the slots aren't up to most mainland standards and the placement of everything is a bit tight, but the service is friendly and the tables draw a mixture of tourists and locals. There is always a party in the lobby. Bands that go all night, huge crowds on the weekends and over priced drinks to make you feel right at home. I haven't even gotten to the two best things about the hotel - the staff and the location. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and no reasonable request wasn't given their full attention, you were made to feel at home. The best part though was the location. The streets of Condado are lined with fabulous restaurants and shops. Pizza Huts, Burger King, Subway, Citibank, Starbucks and Walgreens are all with in a block or two. The local restaurants are top notch and plentiful. Access to Old San Juan is either a 10 min bus (if your lucky enough to catch one) or cab ride.

The staff at the front desk were so accommodating, we actually booked our trip at 4:30pm the previous afternoon and they still gave us the room that we asked for. The room was nice, the AC was excellent to the point where you wanted to turn it off bc it got to be too cold. We stayed in room 1218 which was a partial oceanview room, the view was okay only bc they are building a new hotel next to the marriott so you saw that also. The bed was outstanding along with the pillows, my husband never wants to stay in bed when we go on vacation and I actually had to make him get up one morning bc he was so in love with the bed. The was a safe in the room that we didn't know about, it was under the t.v. The tub stopper kept closing so after you take a shower the water would pool in the tub unless you kept checking the stopper. I liked the elevator bc you could go to the pool and not have to walk through the lobby. One thing that ticks me off about hot tubs and guests is that the signs always say no one under 16 but it never fails someone is always in there with their kids, this was the first hotel that we stayed at where they actually made the kids get out of the hot tub. If you order drinks by the pool, it's faster to get them yourself, the waitstaff could step it up a bit. We didn't eat in the hotel, so I can't comment on the food. There was this place called Gellato's across the street where we got breakfast and beverages for $13 where an egg omelet was $13 by itself in the hotel restaurant. There is a walgreens, pizza hut, chilli's and wendy's nearby. If you want some spanish food go to los penos it's on ponce de leon street going twds carolina. You need a car to get there or you can take a cab but the food is good and cheep and it's open 24 hours a day. If you like beer try Medalla Light, it is a Puerto rican beer, I am not a big beer drinker but I feel in love, it's so good that I'm in NY trying to find out why no one imports to the USA. If you rent a car park on the street, it's cheaper than the hotel parking, but just be careful we got a ticket parking on a the side block by wendys but parking on Ashford was cool and free. Make sure you visit Old San Juan and the mall both easy to get to.

To the right is the casino and to the left is the check in counter. I don't know why but I found this quite ODD! We were immediately able to check into our upgraded room. We were upgraded to a suite that was located on the second floor overlooking the pool, ocean and a little side road. Our room was nice and big!!! The pool was ok. The water was alittle cloudy. They had two pools. One for little kids and one for bigger kids. We mostly sat in the kiddie (no more then three feet deep) pool just to cool off. The slide was fun though!! The patio was quite nice too. The beach was really nice!! The ocean is alittle rough but we had a great time riding the waves. The area surrounding the hotel was very peculiar and seedy!!!!! There was a huge security presense. Some of the buildings were in dire need of a face lift. A lot of buildings were boarded up and some of them were just in really bad shape. FOOD: We ate at the marriott once. We had breakfast at their outdoor restaurant. It was good. We ate at the surrounding restaurants that were located off site. The prices were moderate and the food was good. ACTIVITIES: We took the East Wind Catamaran to Culebra Island. DO this trip. It was fantastic and Flamenco Beach is Beautiful!!! Old San Juan - Had a great time walking around the city. The city has a lot of character and is very picturesque. El Yunque - If you have seen a rain forest before I would skip this one. It was nice but its not worth the time or money to see it. Bioluminescent tour - Now this one....the idea is awesome. It is cool to see and experience this. Getting to and from the bay is a nightmare!!!!!!!!!!! It's pitch black dark. We had motor boats and other kayakers running head on into us. I think there needs to be a mandate for the number of people who are allowed into the bay at once. LITTLE TID BITS: Please be aware that Marriott charges an extra $17 per night resort fee on top of the room rate. This adds up after a few nights. I wish we knew this. The wait staff at all the restuarants try to up sell the menu and try to get you to order extra stuff. Know what you want and try not to be persuaded. If you do go to El Yunque...think about renting a car and going to El Yunque early afternoon and then do the Bioluminescent tour that same night. This saved us the cost of a dinner. approx. $70. There is no set cab fare to go anywhere.....what ever they feel like charging as the wind changes is what they charge. Long story short just be aware that the cab fares are not consistent and do add up. If you have access to the lobby on the Executive level DO take advantage of this. The spread they put out each day (excluding weekends) was impressive. Um...I think thats it. I hope this helps you and gives you some extra information you may not have known.

Yes, there was some construction going on across the way on some other buildings, but I didn't see anything on our hotel. The balcony was very large and nice. The room itself was as nice as any Marriott I have stayed in at Chicago/Miracle Mile or Cleveland or Philly. The bathroom wasn't the nicest I have ever seen, but it served its purpose. DINING. Do not waste your money eating at this hotel. I didn't even consider spending $20 or more per person for breakfast. Walk out the front door, take a left, and go eat at Danny's International for $5-8 per person, and it was just fine. Drinks in the lobby bar are overpriced and awful. ALso, there is a 2 drink minimum when you order there. The food available at the bar was pitiful and the pork rinds and nuts they give you are awful. I ordered a Mojito and sent it back because it was the worst I ever had--the bartender tried to make it with 7-Up instead of sugar water....pathetic. There are a ton of decent restaraunts within easy walking distance, so go there. We turned left out of the hotel and went to some Mexican restaraunt (I know, I know) and had some good late night beer and appetizers for about 1/2 of what 4 drinks cost at the hotel lobby bar. Ikako's was one restaraunt that I thought was great and the staff was very nice and friendly. Plus, if you eat there late in the afternoon, they will make the drinks nice and strong for you. EXERCISE ROOM/POOL. Both were nice enough. CASINO. Small, but enough to lose some money at if you need to. THe biggest thing that aggravated me was that there was a resort fee that was no where disclosed. The fee is 10% which adds up. I wasn't too happy about that, and I complained. We'll see what Marriott has to say. All in all, I was pleased and I would stay here again. We were only here one night, but it was fine. Old San Juan is cool, although touristy, and we walked around until we found some small \"dive\" bars that didn't look too touristy. There were plenty of other restaraunts in Old San Juan that looked tempting as well.

The hotel wasn't very full, and they upgraded us without charge to an ocean view on check-in. The room was typical Marriott - clean, decent furnishings, mattresses with foam toppers, the ubiquitous green/beige carpeting. The a/c disconnects when the balcony door (gorgeous view) is opened, so you have to be careful to close it tightly to keep the room cool. A/C was barely adequate, despite having the engineer check it twice. It cooled to about 73F, but because it is centralized it did nothing for the humidity. We kept it going the entire stay and clothes still came out of drawers damp. The hotel has lots of amenities - the pool is lovely, with a good mix of sun and shade. There is a nice workout room (no charge for guests) with a variety of equipment, and the spa offers a small menu of massages. The hotel advertises wireless internet, but it was not available in our room (though I saw people using it in the lobby). There is an extra charge for Internet access, about $10/day, slightly less by the week. There's also a self-serve laundry facility, which is important because everything is so damp. There's a very small casino off the lobby, and the lobby bar had live music most evenings. The beach is fantastic - a wide swath of sand with clean water, but though the surf was fun for body surfing it was too rough for snorkeling or just floating around. They keep the \"red flag\" (dangerous water conditions) up year-round as there is no lifeguard on the beach. They do have waiters on the beach who circulate fairly often. The on-site restaurants were good - the Vista has a buffet going pretty much all the time, and you can also order from the menu. Lunch/dinner is about $45 for two people, which we thought was reasonable given the variety and location. The Tuscany is more high-end (i.e. the waiters are better dressed), and the food was mixed, with some things quite good and others less so. There are couple of restaurants within walking distance - the hotel is on a \"strip\" of major hotels that are mixed in with smaller guesthouses and restaurants. I've read other reviews comparing the area to South Beach, but I think that's a very poor comparison. There's a Walgreens a half block away (turn right out the front door), which is good for water and snacks. The location is Condado, just a few minutes east of old San Juan. It's about a 10 minute taxi ride, and they charge $12-14 depending on what part of the city you're heading toward. The staff is extremely nice, with the exception of the gift shop and tour staff, who seem to think that guests were an inconvenience. Bottom line - this was our first visit to PR, and we enjoyed the Marriott very much. I probably wouldn't come again at this time of year - it rarely got below 90, and with the high humidity it was uncomfortable to be outside for too long. For our next visit I'll try a guesthouse in a less urban area, I would not pay the \"rack rate\" of close to $300/night (I used points) for this property.", "Date": "August 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronx, NY", "Title": "\u201cVery nice!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3805560", "Content": "My husband and I spent our honeymoon at this resort 3 years ago and had a very nice time.

We were very pleased with the Marriott. We chose this hotel because we wanted to be walking distance from restaurants, near the airport, and we had some Marriott rewards points for a free night. We did not spend much time at the pool. It was crowded most of the daytime and there were lots of families (which doesn't bother us because we travel with our kids). The kiddie pool is large in comparison to the regular pool. The regular pool has a volleyball net running across it, fountains and a slide. We spent most of our time on the beach and it was great. Very peaceful. The red flag was up the entire time, although the water didn't seem all that rough until the last day or 2 when it became more choppy and there were some rain showers. The beach was sandy, no rocks or shells to speak of. We spent our last day at the pool. By then the hotel had emptied out and the weather was iffy. It was very pleasant without the crowds. It's also nice at the pool in the evenings. I can't speak for wait-service at the pool or beach since we didn't order any drinks, but in general we found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. The bellhops were particularly friendly, and offer water bottles (free) when returning from jogging. We ate breakfast at the buffet our first day. There weren't lines at the omelet station but the omelet cook did move quite slowly compared to the same at other Marriotts. One night we ate at Tuscany's. They had a $20 prix fix special between 6 and 7. This was great value although the choices are limited and some of the portions small depending on the choice. The food and atmosphere are very nice. We aslo ate at some nearby places, that for the most part were OK. Breakfast at Danny's Int'l (exit hotel to the left and walk a few blocks) was very good and very inexpensive. There's also an Italian place across from Danny's (I think called Via Appia Deli), that had decent pizza and salads. The Mexican place near the Italian was pleasant in ambience but the food was nothing special (the margarita's were good). The room was average in size and clean. We booked a city view with the AAA rate directly through Marriott and got a good deal. We were upgraded to beach/pool view and were not charged the resort fee.

This was a last minute weekend trip for my husband and me, so we did minimal research. Do yourself a favor and research your destination, especially if you have limited time. This is not a place to stay if you do not have kids. Despite kids and teenagers (and for that matter, some of their parents) screaming, running all over the pool area and not obeying the rules of the pool, the pool area was beautiful and was a relief because it was so hot and humid! Staff at the pool area were very friendly. I would not say that staff as a whole (at the pool) were very attentive. You have to speak up if you want a refill because no one is going to ask you if you want one. We arrived early and the woman (very friendly) who checked us in gave us a beeper to let us know when our room was ready. Well, the beeper never beeped so we went back to the desk at 4 o'clock, which is the check-in time, and our room was ready. The man who gave us our room key not friendly at all. Brian at the lobby bar was very nice, as was Gerry, who kept the lobby area very neat and clean. The bartenders that were at the lobby bar on Friday night were terrible. It was difficult to get a drink and difficult to get the check. We had breakfast at one of the restaurants on Saturday and we were completely rushed through the meal. Don't get the breakfast buffet on the weekend. The line is so long at the omelet station that the rest of your food will be cold by the time your eggs are cooked. The hotel needs serious updating (which is in the process of occurring). Our room was comfortable and clean, however, one day housekeeping did not clean our room until after I spoke with the housekeeping supervisor (at 5:00 p.m.). Don't bother with the hotel gift shop, people who work there are less than welcoming. Don't expect most of the staff in general to be overwhelmingly friendly to make you feel welcome or that you are glad that you booked the hotel. If you plan on staying for a romantic weekend, think about staying elsewhere. Also, plan on going off of the Condado if you really want to have a good time. The best meal we had was at El Convento in Old San Juan. If we do return to San Juan, we will stay at at more upscale hotel like El Convento and take day trips off the Condado.

Having stayed at this hotel approx. 20 times during the past 5 years, I feel I have some balanced perspective. My most recent stay was in April 05. The hotel facility was previously a different hotel (Diplomat) which was destroyed by a fire in the mid 80's. Marriott bought the building and renovated in the late 90's. Many of the ongoing renovations are replacement activities from the original hotel (such as old windows and doors). Prior to initiating major renovations, particularly to the rooms, both the website and the hotel advise all guests. I agree that during the past few years the service has been spotty. Sometimes good/sometimes bad but honestly more often good. I have never found any part of the facility (hotel, gym, casino) to be \"run down\". In fact there is constant cleaning occuring in the common areas of the hotel.there The rooms are of varying size but I have never stayed in what I'd consider a small room. In the tower section of the hotel it is better to stay on floors 14 and higher because there is some noise from the lobby music - also the cabana wing is less noisy. The beds are very comfortable (soft mattress) and the housekeeping and overall upkeep has always been excellent during my stays. The pool area is quite attractive with nice landscaping, chairs, umbrellas and wait service for drinks. People who are complaining about excessive children most likely were visitng during school holiday time. I have not experienced an overwhelming number of out of control children at the pool. The beach area is public beach (city of San Juan) and not owned by the Marriott - however the hotel does provide chairs and umbrellas. The water is clean, particularly for an urban setting however there is a serious under-tow/rip-tide possibility at this beach - BE CAREFUL when swimming. The restaurants and room service are expensive - in fact I think more expensive than comparable restaurants in SJ. However in the immediate area of the Marriott (within 1/2 mile walking) are many restaurants from mid-range chains (Uno) to fine dining (Ramiros). There are also 2 Japanese restaurants within close distance (1 next to the hotel). I have never felt unsafe walking in the Condado area of San Juan - even late at night. I have found that in the past year, the SJ Marriott rates are almost always on the high-end (rarely less than $225 per night for city view room). In the past there were more frequent weekend specials and I've stayed for as little as $140 per night. For the current rates charged, there are other hotels in the city (Ritz Carlton or Intercontinental) which might provide a better experience for the money. Bottom line - if you're spending more than $225-250 and seek a true luxury experience then spend a little more and stay at the Ritz Carlton. If you want a relaxing stay in a clean, comfortable hotel with many options for dining outside the hotel AND you can get a rate of $225 or less, then I'd recommend the SJ Marriott.", "Date": "June 26, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cRun down and horrible\u201d", "Author": "ChelseaNYC", "ReviewID": "UR3599106", "Content": "Keep looking -- this hotel is a dump.

The ferry to go over is $2.50. When you get off the ferry, take the bus to flamingo beach (2.00). YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS TRIP. Anyway, the Marriot is okay. There is a nightclub across the street that was popular and plenty of walking distance to many resturants. Pureto Rico is a great island to visit, but you are cheating yourself, if you only stay in San Juan. By the way, almost everyone speaks or understands English, so do not make a fool of yourself, by trying to speak the spanish you learned in high school or college.

Did no one see what we saw? I must say that I will never book anyone in the Marriott, San Juan especially but probably not the Condado area as well. Here's why. First off, be forewarned that construction in the San Juan area (including Old San Juan and Candado) is rampant and EVERYWHERE - as are the problems that come along with it in any city, namely; traffic, noise, congestion. If this statement alone is enough to make you question San Juan as a place you'd like to vacation peacefully - trust your instincts and book a hotel at an alternate location in PR outside of the San Juan city area (Dorado, Isla Verde or farther) or choose an alternate island in the carribbean. As for the Marriott itself, and I am AMAZED no one has really made a point of this, THE HOTEL ITSELF IS UNDERGOING A 4 PHASE RECONSTRUCTION ON THE WEST END AND ON THE PROPERTY IMMIDIATELY EAST A HOTEL IS BEING BUILT THROUGH 2006. This means that unless you want a view of a construction site, your only bet is the middle-back of the hotel that overlooks the pool. Now if your room assigned does not have a working balcony as a result of the work being done, you are entitled to 5000 marriott points per night or a $100 food and beverage credit per night (sign upon checkin). This means that if you stay on the West side of the hotel where they are painting and renovating the outside and therefore your balcony is locked for safety and out of use, you are entitled. Unfortunately, if your balcony is functional (as was ours, although it overlooked a construction pit and 2- 100 foot cranes to the East. I am sadly not kidding), we did not apply for the credit. Of other notes, our room was 2-3* quality, so be forewarned the high stars given on tripadvisor are indeed misleading. While I understand the level of sophistication is generally not as high in the Carribbean as it is elsewhere, the reality is our room was not the usual Marriott quality (ie. clean, comfortable). A 4* hotel does not have mold growing around the caulf of the tub, our bedding looked shabby, the bathroom needed a desperate regrout, and our balcony had cheap plastic furniture that looked about 10 years old. I could deal w that - after all, how long are you really in a room? But After speaking to the manager and explaining we were not informed of the construction when booking the hotel (which is right next to the beach - you MUST be able to hear it when outside during the day), I was still not offered ANY type of compensation or apology because I was 'upgraded' to a room with a balcony. An insult, to say the least, being our balcony overlooked a pit and construction cranes. I responded by informing the manager the hotel booking policy of not informing guests of the construction, and then not compensating those they deem 'unaffected' is not good business and I would not recommend such a property to my clients. To which I was told to my amazement 'that's fine, do not book your clients here'. Which leads me to ask - if this is the way the hotel manager treats an agent, how would he treat a poor client ? This is not to imply that the manager's attitude prevails in terms of the rest of the Marriott employees - that would be unfair. But when I go away on vacation, I expect a few basic things - namely, clean sheets, a clean bathroom, and a quiet place to relax and read a book or nap. Unfortunately after an hour at the Marriott, it seemed clear to me none of these things would happen without an excruciating effort that would defeat the point of my vacations. So I cut my losses and I checked out. As for the pool, we never swam but it looked very nice. The beach we never made it to so I cannot comment. The casino was a typical hotel casino (a bit smaller than I expected). The lounge bar was very active however the music was too loud (and I like music!) to hear the person next to you. Be forewarned there is a 'resort fee' or $10 a day and also a daily parking fee of $18 per day if you decide to stay here. As far as the Condado 'strip', we were told of the many nice restaurants on the outside of the hotel but we walked the strip and found nothing other than local 2* joints. Not that that is ever necessarilly a bad thing - but just as I expect the cons of a city (ie. noise, traffic, etc), I expect the pros as well (more sophisticated areas, better dining, etc). I am a 26 year old girl and I would not have felt safe walking alone had my boyfriend not been there to be honest. (There is a little, shady strip club across the street and 5 doors down from the Marriott). All in all, I must say that I recommend no one stay at this hotel or Condado in general. The city of Old San Juan is not very big and there is no real benefit to staying near it - the traffic is horrendous, there is construction everywhere, I assume there is rampant poverty as we saw a ton of shanty areas and 'for sale' signs, and even strolling down the streets you will be continuously bombarded by people in their cars and on their scooters playing excessively loud music. (I live in Manhattan and don't need to leave the motherland to enjoy that). If you do go, you can see El Morro and el castillo and enjoy lunch or dinner and some shopping around all of Old San Juan in half a day. As far as nightlife, we were only in old San Juan for a night, but didn't see many options other than 5 or so nice restaurants. (So if nightlife is your thing, this is not your place - go to South Beach, Cancun, stay at Atlantis, etc). Most resorts outside of San Juan do not charge their guests parking and by the time you add up taxi fees and tour transportation charges (for example, if you travel to el yunque (the rainforest), it is $50 per person for the bus tour, a cab from the airport to Candado is $15 each way). Therefore, my strong suggestion is to rent a car and just get out of San Juan - stay elsewhere on the Island. We ended up at the Hyatt Dorado which was lovely - I will post a review for that. Hope this helps give you a more detailed view of the Marriott/Condado area.", "Date": "June 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cMarriott has changed a lot since the last time I went there..\u201d", "Author": "LisaNewYork", "ReviewID": "UR3536239", "Content": "I've stayed at the San Juan Marriott 5 years ago and enjoyed my stay. However, this time around was totally different. The hotel staff itself is very friendly. They open doors and are very courteous. That's never a problem. But the hotel is run down and definitely needs repairs which we knew before we decided to stay there. I believe the repairs are being made the first week of June. The pool area is small. There were tons of kids the week I stayed here and very unruly as well. They did not adhere to the rules of the pool area. They were jumping and diving into the pool which was prohibited; they were climbing up the water slide after the lifeguard was off duty and they were throwing volleyballs at each other. The hotel staff did absolutely nothing to reprimand them. The swim up bar shuts down at 4:00 p.m. - after that, you have to get out of the pool and walk to the outdoor bar if you want a drink. It's very loud and noisy. If you want a quiet place to relax and enjoy the beach and pool, DO NOT stay here. On weekends, the beach can get very crowded. If you're not out very early, your chance of getting beach chairs and an umbrella are very slim. I also witnessed nudity on the beach which I don't think is appropriate for a family hotel. Also, we made 2 reservations with the concierge for dinner, which were NOT made. We had to confirm with them and it's a good thing we did, otherwise we would not have had reservations. If you want good Puerto Rican food - eat at Ajili Mojili - they have great Mofongo. Ropa Vieja is also very good. Another excellent restaurant is Ramiro's. This place is an upscale Spanish restaurant and is walking distance from the hotel. I would make reservations. The rooms for the most part are decent size and are clean. I recommend staying on a higher floor because of the nightlife downstairs in the hotel lobby. They have singing, dancing, bands etc which was nice. The trip to Camuy Caves is nice but is definitely NOT worth the $90 the Marriott charges you compared to other hotels that charge $74.

I was meeting a friend there from Boston and she arrived first, checking into a smoking, ocean-front room. The only reason we stayed was because it DID NOT smell like smoke - we are both non-smokers but loved the view. Unfortunately, the hotel said they did not have any other ocean front rooms available in non-smoking so we would have been stuck in city-view if it had smelled. We had a housekeeping issue the first night as well, finding hair in the bed and in the shower that was not ours, and immediately called the front desk. The hotel did show great customer service in giving us a $100 credit at the Italian restaurant on site. (More on that later) But at check-out, it showed a small charge from the restaurant that we had been told had been covered...was resolved, but an added hassle. Other than the hair, the room was fine, the beds were comfortable and it was clean. Tuscany, the italian restaurant, is AMAZING. Not only is the service fabulous, but the food is wonderful.

The only issue at the pool is finding a sunny place to be for the day. The hotel placed palm trees all over the pool area and they block the sun depending on where you sit. The beach is all open and they have lounge chairs and umbrellas although if you like long walks on the beach, this is not the place for you. I enjoy walking the beach to exercise and there's not too far to walk. There is a great band at night in the lobby and a casino in the hotel(a few $5 and $10 tables for blackjack). Plus you can walk to a bunch of restaurants and bars on Ashford Ave. We went into San Juan twice and it's a $10 cab ride and great to walk around and try some restaurants! Maria's is a local place for frozen drinks, The Parrot Club and sister restaurants are fun and if shopping is your thing, there is a Coach Factory store there! The only other major issue was the concierge. They are not the most helpful and don't make too many good recommendations. I suggest researching the area on your own before you go. If I go back, I'll try to stay at the IC unless the price is much better at the Marriott.", "Date": "May 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNice on the inside, but looks a little shabby outside\u201d", "Author": "reed13ja", "ReviewID": "UR3504315", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for three nights after a cruise. The hotel is large and nice, and the service is very friendly. The only problems we had were with the outside of the building and the neighboring buildings.

But this could add up to a lot of noise! The hotel is also surrounded by construction of other buildings on both sides, and the whole area of the beach is a little shabby. Speaking of the beach, if you are bringing kids, be careful! The water is VERY rough and has a strong undertoe. Few parents would let their children swim, and if they did the kids stayed in the water for no more than five minutes. I still have sand in my ears from the huge waves knocking me down! In fact, local kids came to the beach in front of our hotel to surf. On the other hand, the pool is great for kids and there are activities planned daily. The hotel resteraunts are so-so, a little overpriced in my opinion. The area has a few nice local places as well as chain resteraunts. KFC delivers to the hotel if you really miss home-cooking! The hotel is close to Old San Jaun which is a great trip. Also, there is a tour desk that plans reasonably priced tours to local attractions. They offer trips to the rainforest, the Bacardi distillery, Old San Jaun, and moonlight kayaking. The hotel does have a nice casino, but it is a little small! Don't expect anything like Vegas.

We spent 6 wonderful days at the San Juan Marriott & Stellaris Casino. We usually stay at 3 star hotels but will probably not do so again. There is a big difference and the staff at the Marriott was on a mission to prove it. At every turn they were opening doors, asking if we needed help, or bending over backwards to make sure that our 20th anniversary stay was a memorable one. It most certainly was. I want to specifically call out Carl at La Vista. We were lucky enough to get him as our server/waiter on our first morning for breakfast. We asked for him every day after that. He was friendly and hustled to make sure that we had everything that we needed. If you don't want to be talked to and just want someone to \"get my breakfast\" then just say so. But, if you want someone who's engaging and personable then Carl's your man! We had a room on the cabana/ocean side. The views were incredible. We woke up to the sound of ocean waves crashing every morning. The pool had a water slide that my Daughter and I spent countless hours on. We were with our 6 year old Daughter so we couldn't really hang at the bar or casino but it looked like it was a happening place. When we'd return every night the bar was packed and they always had a great Latin band. The dance floor was always full. We read some reviews before we left that mentioned that you should make sure that you asked for floors above the 4th. I would echo that. We were on the 8th and didn't really hear anything.

We enjoy Latin music and loved the bands that played in the lobby area while we were there. We ate at the hotel one morning. The menu is limited and the breakfast buffet is \"encouraged\". I understand why since the buffet runs between $13-$16 and ordering ala carte coffee, water, and granola cost $12. Needless to say we ate at a small cafe down the street the next morning.

If you are into buffets this is the way to go. The kids loved it but a waste of money. I dont care for buffets and I thought the menu was very boring...all I wanted was a toss salad and couldnt get one! The pool area was very nice, however, get your chairs early because they go fast and by 11am there is none to be found. The pool swim-up bar was closed, no activites for the kids, they had a volley ball net, but no balls and by the middle of the week the net was gone. The 90 ft slide was the best feature, you have to try it, I even did, it was great! However, they open up a 11am close by 4, while alot of the families are just getting back from day trips by that time, a real bummer for my kids. The beach area was very clean and nice, the water is a little rough(undertoe) but that depends if the wind is blowing or not. The lounge area at nite was very quite, on the weekends the locals come and dance, the place was mobbed. The casino was good, didnt hit on the slots but played 21/2 hours at roulette table with $25, I should have walked away when I was well ahead! Overall, it was just OK, I would not stay there again. Restaurants...Miros...2blocks down(walking distance) was excellent, service was great.The Cherry Blossom next door is your typical bonzai restaurant, good for the kids. We went to the Caribe Hilton to Mortons, great steak, but expensive. This hotel looked great, we took a walk around, tons of stuff for the kids. We rented a car and went to Liguillo beach by Farajedo, about an hr. drive from San Juan, absolutely beautiful, plan on doing a day there. Seven Seas beach was nothing to brag about. We did East Coast Cattermaran/snorkel great time, the crew was great, they made 2 stops to snorkel, one shallow water which was great for my 7 year old, they have aslide off the back of the boat. They gave us a great lunch and all we could drink. The 2nd stop was in deeper waters, the water current was too stong for me and my 7 yr old. All in all, great experience. We did the new/old San Juan bus tour/ one of the forts, nice trip, the kids were bored until we got to the fort, only 45 minutes to shop, was not enough time.

It was not great but it was pretty good and we had a wondeful time. I had read reviews on this board before leaving and was not sure what to expect. In the end I was plesantly surprised. First let me say that I have stayed in a variety of hotels from really cheap to some of the best including Four Seasons and Ritz. I mostly stay in Marriotts on business and amassed some points to use for this particular stay. I do not expect Marriotts to be 5 star establishiments. They are not competing with super high end luxury hotels so if that's what your used to.. forget it. The service is not as solicituous and the small details and overall experience of a Four Seasons is not what you're going to get. Having said that,h it was still nice. The hotel is in pretty good condition with the common areas very clean and well kept. The hotel has begun their renovation and crews were in the process of painting the exterior. Our room (city view) was fine. Clean, reasonable size but was a little dated. We were on the 5th floor. Word of warning: if you are in the main tower and go to bed early, you want to be high ie.. 8th floor plus. The night club in the lobby gets VERY loud and we could here the base thumping as late as 3am on saturday night! Pool is very nice, lots of young kids, but better that than crawling with spring breakers. Also, the whole pool area is in full sun by about 11am unless you are under a palm tree.Service was very good at the pool with people regularly circling to see if you wanted a $7.50 frozen drink or a $12 burger. Hey, it was expensive but it's a resort! The only truly bad service we had was a surley attendant at the beach who didn't have his story straight about whether to charge us $12 for an umbrella or not. If you are being charged the \"resort fee\" of 10% per night then the umbrellas are free. We were not being charged the fee as we were using points so we had to pay for the umbrella. Oh well, the 12 bucks was less than 10%. As far as I could tell, the 10% resort fee does not seem to cover anything else of importance so better you pay for the umbrella. The beach itself is clean, big, not crowded and the water is beautiful. Their is some surf but not too bad. My wife and I both had massages. She said hers was great. Mine was o.k. At $100 a pop they are pretty pricey. The spa was very clean although the lockers were not fuctional. But the massage rooms and atmosphere were nice. Again, it's not the Four Seasons. The area of Condado is great. It is kind of like south beach Miami but not as upscale. Nice stores and o.k. restaurants. I would recommend Tijuanna for great mexican food and the Mariachi band. Yeuba Buena was not bad. Danny's has very good pizza and breakfast. Everything is pretty expensive, figure, $70 bucks for two people for an average meal with a couple of drinks. We also hit the Burger King down the street for Breakfast. It was cheap and quick. We ate one nite at La Mallorcina. Recommended by the concierge. Not very good, don't go. Pricey, small portions of average food. Also check out Piu Bello Gelato. Great deserts and Ice Cream at a reasonable price. The only outside activity we did was a Catamaran/Snorkel trip aboard the SpreadEagle II. Don't let the name fool you. This was a very professional crew who did a great job. We actually sailed (most of these boats just moter to save time). We went to two beautiful beaches on the same island for great snorkeling and actually fed fish by hand with bread left over from lunch. You get all you can drink Pina Coladas and Rum Punch as well as soda and water. Lunch is a sandwich buffet which didn't sound all that big of a deal but turned out to be very good. Lots of fixings, everything laid out fresh along with fruit and salad. All of this for $77 per person. I can't say enough about the crew. They were fun, professional, courteous, and worked very hard to make sure everyone had a geat time. Overall our vacation was great. Puerto Rico is more like a carribean island than a 51st U.S. state. Many people speak little or no English and the standard of living is low with some areas we drove through looking very 3rd world. Way to much on this board is made of the hotel's surrounding area being \"scary\" \"unclean\" or \"full of Graffiti\". The Condado area is clean, seems very safe and the graffiti was limited to buildings that are in the process of being demolished to make way for more luxury property. Overall we found it a very convienient area to be in with much within walking distance and only a 10 min cab ride to the airport.

There were no lockers available (they were available, but the locks on the lockers were broken...that is what they told us) and when I went to rinse off after my massage, the showers were crawling with mildew on the walls and ceiling. My husband told me that the mens locker room was equally as bad if not worse because the toilets were filthy. Not very clean in my opinion. The pool area is nice. There were a lot of kids, but it was easy to find a chair. The shade was great, as the heat is a killer. I think there is bar staff that comes around to take drink orders, but I only saw one person. It appeared that the hotel was very short staffed overall. We got a corner ocean room, it was nice, but I think we could been just as satisfied with an ocean view room. We had access to the concierge level during the day and they were nice there. It was worth getting breakfast there as breakfast in the hotel is really expensive. You might as well save your money for better restaurants outside of the hotel. The maid service is poor. We came back from being out all day to find our room not made up, it was annoying considering we were tired and wanted to take a shower, instead we had to wait for the maid service to clean our room.

I wouldn't have minded as much if it had been in the first day or two but after four days I really didn't appreciate it.

It is time for some renovation which I understand is coming. The hotel needs to improve their game room to accomodate more kids. Bottom Line- My family is eagerly awaiting the opportunity to return.

Every thing was great. The pool area was clean and the water not cold at all. The slide is so much fun. Fri Sat Sun their was a steel band poolside. The were activities scheduled for the kids- arts & crafts, cake decorating.. There was bingo for adults. and a scheduled pool game for teens. The pool always has a volleyball or basket ball game going on. If you want to just swim there was not much room for that. The beach was public and clean. Staff was always there to help get a chair or drink for you. Yes there is a lot of construction around hotel, but the only sound I heard sitting @ beach was crashing waves and a faint sound of the steel band. The water is rough but my teenage sons had a great time body surfing. The lobby was so lively. It was great. If you are looking for quiet relaxing time the lobby was not the place to go. We had breakfeast @ the hotel. It was a buffet and was very good. On Sat when the hotel was busy, they had two seperate buffet areas set up and used the tables near the bar to accomodate everyone. I was immpressed how they accomodated the amount of people that were there for breakfast. Lunch poolside was also good. Service was good and food was good. Dinner we had out everynite. We went to Yuerba's for carribean food. The food was very good, but the service was beyond slow. We waited twoo hours after ordering our dinner.( I know it was a busy weekend, but that was slow even for Island time). The rooms were great. We had two ocenfront rooms. It was fantastic to sit on the balcony and listen to the ocean. The rooms were very clean. One day they left fresh fruit and other nites left chocolate. The staff was very friendly. Security is always around. The only thing that was annoying was following the sun. The buildings block the sun as it moves. You are constantly moving your chair to either stay in the shade or to keep in the sun. Althoughj we don't snorkel we went on an all day snorkling trip on the advice of the tour desk. She was so right!! You sail out about 45 minutes to the most beautiful beahc ever. You can snorkel, or go off the slide on the back of the boat, or swim or just relax on the boat. They serve a coldcut lunch and pina colada's , soda and rum punch. They had a glass bottom on one side of the boat, so even though we didn't snorkl;e we got to see some great tropical fish.. There is a lot of construction going on and graffitti around. This had absolutley no effect on this trip at all..

My friends and I made friends with some locals the first day we arrived and hung out with them every day we were there. They showed us their puerto rico which was the best experience. We partied all night and afterwards went to the beach to watch the sun come up almost every day. Oooh and I also learned a new drink receipe called Lemoncillo. The spelling may not be right but its water, bacardi 151, and crystal light. You do not taste the 151 and its sooooo good but it can sneak up on you if your not careful. Here is a a quick guide to the nightlife: Thursdays: Babylon/Moorings Friday's: Babylon / 360 / Element / Senor Frogs/ Outside bar next to Condado Plaza/Moorings Saturday's: Babylon/ Ochos de Blanco/ Moorings Sunday's: Lupi's / Lazer Monday: stay in not much to do besides have a nice dinner and drink Tuesday's: Senor Frogs Great Place to Eat: City Grill in Old San Juan ( 311 Recinto Sur Street) It's fairly new but the food is amazing it just melts in your mouth. Plus our waiters ( Luis & George ) were friendly, cute, funny and spoke english. I had the tequila steak which I am still drooling over. Island You HAVE TO VISIT: CULEBRA....to get to culebra you have to drive or take a taxi to Fajardo which is about an hour drive from San Juan and take a ferry there which cost $2.25. Reserve a hotel b4 you arrive unless you are camping out on Playa Flamenco. The white sand and crystal blue water along with the views are gorgeous. Old San Juan: Everyone just strolls the boardwalk and streets at night on the weekends. There is so much to do that Next time I go I will definately stay longer than 7 days and brush up on my Spanish because not many people speak english once you leave the hotel.

Go a little farther down the street to a convenient store to replenish your mini-bar cheaply! San Juan is a big city so expect big-city activity (traffic on Saturday night, a beggar here and there, and fast-food chains). I thought the streets where impeccably clean. And yes, there are some hotels under construction in the area. But none of that disturbed our stay in the least. Do your best to seek out the local food. While not for waistwatchers, the local cuisine is delicious. Pamela's at the Numero Uno guest house was a superior upscale dining experience that was also grade-school-age kid friendly.

Powerfull undertone, huge waves but lots of fun if you stay close to shore. The pool was OK, small to my liking but clear and clean water. Finding a spot in the sun can be tricky. Water never too cold, just right. Breakfast was ok, rest of the time we ate out. Tijuanas, and Italian place next door was great. Miro's not worth the $$ in my opinion. For evenings, right across the street is nice hangout, or all along Ashfor Ave., places to sit outside and have a coctail or cold beer. For clubbing you can go to Babylon at the Wyndham (Thursday nights really, really young crowd), for more mature atmosphere check out the Water Club wet bar on roof (amazing view) and plush white leather couches, and the club on first floor.

Let me preface this review stating that we are very frequent travelers (me staying in a hotel around 30 nights/year and my husband about 150 nights/year) and have stayed at a variety of hotels, including 4 and 5 star resorts in Hawaii, Scottsdale, Venice and Puerto Vallarta. We chose the Marriott because 1) it had good reviews 2)it was on the beach and 3) we had Marriott Rewards that could get us 2 nights free stay at this particular hotel. This hotel was not worth it. The room was very small. I called to get another room, they said the hotel was \"booked\" for the entire length of our stay. The room next door must have had it's plumbing in our walls because every morning we woke up to a loud (let's put that airplane flying over your house looud) percolator type of noise in our room. Again, hotel was booked, so no way to change rooms. If you must stay here, specifically request not room 622, or any room on the 6th floor or lower if you stay there on Fri, Sat or Sun and you want a quiet room before 3am. Hotel overall clean, but not extravagently clean. Service was poor, no one really cared that we were guests at their hotel. Pools were OK, slide was fun. Hot tub is not hot, but pleasantly warm. They will carry beach chairs to the beach for you (for free and chairs are free) but the umbrellas others rented were $12/day. Ocean was nice. Food and drinks are expensive as are normal at hotels. We ate a La Vista basically every day for breakfast which is a typical hotel \"cafeteria\". Needs an update to be a 4 or 5 star resort. Had a massage, and it was OK, but the \"spa\" is not really a \"spa\" it is cheap massage tables in rooms in the basement of the hotel with the fitness center. Fitness center very nice....use this. Nice location of the hotel on the beach and plenty of things in walking distance and has a bus stop in front to get to Old San Juan which I recommend. Casino OK.

Ther is construction all over San Juan but if you think about it there is alot of construction in Times Square too, so I didnt let it bother me. The water slide was extremely fun and I was one of the few adults who kept trying it! For those complaining of the cold pool there is a perfectly good hot tub spa area almost like a jacuzzi and is very relaxing. I used it myself when the sun went down. The beach was very enjoyable and the hotel provides you with the towels and beach chairs. I got a very good tan. The waves were pretty strong for children but they were good for me it was very fun! As for the learning part of my vacation... We went to the tour desk of the hotel and bought two tours. One to El Yunque rainforest and one to go snorkeling in Ikakos island. The rainforest tour guide \"YOGI\" was extremely informative (ask 4 him he looks a little nuts but is very smart and sweet!) I learned about the endangered puerto rican parrot (there were lots of fake nests all over the forest to try to help them reproduce no luck yet:( Also I learned about all kinds of plants and the different uses that the Taino indians gave to them. The ride up to the rainforest was nice too. You get to see all the locals going about there business and up the mountains you get to see bulls, horses, cows and plenty of roosters. Snorkeling was a blast! I saw a beautiful white fish on the shore (I was to chicken to go deep) My husband did though and he was very impressed with the variety of fish he saw. The best part of that was the whales that we saw on our way over there it was astonishing(also very rare to see). El Morro in Old San Juan was very enjoyable to me I learned alot about the history of my country. It's like a museum. The area surroundng the hotel is very busy but I like that. I went to some expensive restuarants like Ajili Mojili (a short walk east of the hotel) the food was o.k. Then I went to a very cheap restuarant called the Godfather and the food was excellent! The hotel was great so whether youre gonna be in the hotel all day or on and about all day I think the Marriott is a very good and safe choice. Even if the hotel is not of your liking I'm sure you'll find something interesting to do in Puerto Rico. Like the night club Babylon which is very popular if thats your thing. For the younger crowd there is Club Luxor. Also, for shopaholics like me there is Plaza Las Americas which was heaven. It's one of the largest malls in all the carribean. It was fantastic. I didnt give the hotel a perfect rating because I'm sure that it's not the best but it's pretty close. Whatever you do dont let anything get you down be open and enjoy. That's what youre going on vacation for right? P.S Be sure to try some typical fried foods of Puerto Rico like Alcapurrias or Relleno de Papa if u dont mind gaing a couple extra pounds!!!

We took a red-eye flight from NY and arrived at the hotel around 2:30 am. Upon checking in we were disappointed to discover that the hotel did not have the room we had initially paid for through our travel agent (who is a close personal friend...so I know she booked it properly). We had paid for an ocean/pool view room with a king bed, and instead got a ocean/pool room with two full beds. Of course we were unhappy so upon speaking with the hotel management we were offered a city view room (which is NOT much to look at) with a King size bed or the option to stay where we were. Not much of a choice! I felt that the hotel was not overly accomodating and did not even offer any sort of compesation for the inconvience. I instead insisted we be compensated and so they eventually offered us a free breakfast on the hotel which was not much to write home about! After much deliberation we were guaranteed the correct room the next morning, but it wasnt without me being somewhat pushy to get what we were entitled to. However, after our room switch the next morning the rest of our stay was quite enjoyable. We were placed on the 15th floor and the view was INCREDIBLE. Every night I sat out on the balcony from our room and just enjoyed listening to the waves crash and the clean night breeze. As for the hotel staff, I overall felt that they were not completely accomodating, but were helpful when questions needed to be answered (be aware that they do sometimes give falsified information IE: bus times and schedules). While there we ate at a few local restaurants and ventured over to the Wyndham hotel to check our the casino there (which is quite a step up from the Marriot). We did eat at Tuscany (in the Marriot) which was good food and good service (lots of seafood). I will definitely return to Puerto Rico in years to come...whether I stay at the Marriot is another question.

Instead of the $90 for hotel bus trip to Yunque Rainforest for two, we got a rental car from OCharleys for one day for $28 and drove there ourselves. OCharleys is about 10 blocks toward Old San Juan on Ashford St near Chilis. I would not suggest driving to other tourist attractions in San Juan city as streets are poorly marked and traffic is horrendous. I would also suggest taking a small back pack for water bottles, rain gear, etc. Most wives do not like their purses to be used as a carry all! If you want something cheaper for a hotel but yet clean and safe- try the Holiday Inn Express nearby. They also offer a free continental breakfast.", "Date": "January 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cLoved the San Juan Marriott\u201d", "Author": "TravelLover", "ReviewID": "UR2999783", "Content": "We stayed at the Marriott Dec 17-19 for a precruise stay.

We had our breakfast each morning outside right next to the beach. . .had a wonderful view of the ocean. Our room was clean without any musty, moldy smell whatsoever. We were put in a cityview room (the hotel was completely booked so no upgrade) but on the eighteenth floor. When we stepped out onto our balcony we had a beautiful view of the ocean and beach! The balcony was fairly large with two lounge chairs and a table. It was glorious to have our coffee out on the balcony before heading down to the buffet. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful with tips on where to eat, where to buy bottled water etc. and how to get to Old San Juan inexpensively. We took the public transportation bus for 25 cents each. The bus stop was a half a block from the hotel and we were told that it ran every 30 minutes. We never waited more than 10 minutes. The bus took us down to a central bus terminal and then we hopped on a free trolley that took us around Old San Juan. We rode this a while to get our bearings. . .then got out and walked around. We walked on the Princessa (a beautiful pedestrian walkway that goes along the wall of the city). We also walked to El Morro (fort) which had beautiful views. The beach was very nice and clean. The ocean was very warm. . .I agree with a previous poster that it seemed to be warmer than the pool. My daughter (and husband) loved the water slide. They do have a beautiful hot tub which also had a waterfall flowing into it. . .of warm water. . .felt wonderful. They also had many poolside activities for kids and adults. Many people have commented on the noise in the lobby. I didn't find it excessive at all. It was great latin music which could only be heard in the lobby area itself. They also had a wonderful steel drum band by the pool. We had a great time recognizing traditional Christmas carols with a caribbean flair!

From another post I read I do agree about the pool being unheated and the sun was being blocked by the main hotel. The swim up bar had little to offer in atmosphere. If you sat in the pool at the bar you were staring at a blank wall that seperated you from the much higher people sitting on the other outside of the pool bar. The beach is only about 4 blocks long before you come to rocks at each end to block any further walking and the beach area is full of empty buildings either being torn down or should be (with grafitti and broken windows included). During our stay no problem with lounge chairs though. There are a few nice stores and restraunts but not as much as we thought would be. This is a good spot if you basically plop on a beach or pool, not a big partier and only want a couple of tables for gambling. There is no water activities to be seen. The pool area closes at 6pm and the disco had no live music on sun. or mon. nites. No tv's in lobby lounge and the ones located in the casino bar were working but you couldn't sit at that bar sometimes after 12am but it was still open as a service bar (tells me they want your gambling $$ only) We checked out the Wyndham Condado and was much more impressed with the pool and casino there which the security guard informed us was open 24 -7 (sorry not the pool BAR though). If you really want a party spot with clubs, 2 lobby bars, and well known restraunts with great pool area check out the San Juan hotel and casino in Isla Verde it's only about 15 minutes by cab from Cando but definatley appeared to be a better area from what we could tell about the night we visted. Another spot from Condado by a 45-60 minute cab ride (car much cheaper) is the Wyndham El Conquistador it is closer to the rain forrest , has it's own island for the guests and is a beautiful resort also Much closer to bio bay area.

We also went to a local market and bought some food which we kept in our room, while buying water at the Walgreens. We ate at Senor Frogs in Old San Juan one night because they were advertising everywhere, tourists had t-shirts on from there, and locals told us how great it was. We hated it. It was very much a local hangout. They had beer drinking competions and the food was simply burgers and frys. They also give you balloon hats to wear. The streets are not bad at all, and we did not experience any beggers along the streets anywhere, nor did we witness any animal cruelty.

We could have gotten a lower nonrefundable rate of $144.00 without breakfast, but decided against it. There is a friendly bar in the center of the lobby and a coffee shop (though there's also a Starbucks right across the street). The restaurant on the premises, Tuscany, is superb! We felt that the dinner we had was reasonably priced for food of such high quality. In fact, the pasta with lobster dish two of us chose was better than anything we had on our cruise--though the cruise line is well known for its cuisine. The casino is small and we didn't spend much time in it--we don't like smoky places. The grounds, pool, and beach are nice, and the Condado location is safe and convenient.

Last time I checked \"Locals\" were allowed to frequent the same places that guests in their country do. Its also very unusual to hear live bands play without paying a cover charge. The two drink minimum, which in our case was not enforced, was merely to compensate for no cover charge.

Service was friendly and efficient; better than we had expected. But I found it really annoying that at 4PM daily, small signs were placed on every table in the lobby announcing a two drink minimum per person. Every evening the lobby became a bustling discotheque. The noise was deafening. There really wasn't anywhere to go and have a drink at night other than the \"lobby disco\", an obvious cash cow for the hotel which attracts many more locals than hotel guests. The disco seemed to go until about 4 in the morning. Food was average. Nothing to write home about, but not terribly expensive. We mainly ate breakfast there and the service was very good. Poolside lunch was subpar; mainly airport quality sandwiches and burgers. The beach was littered with cigarette butts and fast food debris and not all that inviting.

My best friend who is Puerto Rican recommended the Marriot. He had been there about 2 months before us. We had also had gotten some feedback from others that stayed at other Hotels. My friend has very good taste so I took his word for this Hotel. After reading some reviews on trip advisor I started to wonder about his taste in Hotels, there were so many negative reviews that I began to wonder. We decided to go anyway and to our suprise the Hotel was everything he said it was. The rooms were clean and smelled like a hotel in the tropics should smell, like ocean air. And just like any other fancy hotel in the world if you use the room \"wet-bar\" you will be over charged, this is why they are there. Granted the Hotels restaurants were not cheap(priced accordingly) but if we had wanted to eat cheap food we could have gone to any of the many \"fast-food\" restaurants within walking distance. Which brings me to the next negative thing I had read, car rentals and parking. Renting a car was a great investment. If you were 4 people and had wanted to go on a \"guided\" tour it was easily $55-$95 per person. We had rented a brand new Toyota Corolla for $60 a day and can stay as long as we want any where we went. It is very hard to park in most towns but with patience we found great spots everywhere we went, and we went all over the Island. Now for the parking lot in the hotel. They charged us $12 for parking and you can go in and out within 24hours as much as you wanted to. To some this may sound like too much for guests in the hotel but after doing the math it is still cheaper. The best part was the absolutely perfect ocean water. After all the places me and my family had been too (which adds up to alot of places) we thought the ocean in Puerto Rico was possibly the best. I highly recommend one of the many Catamaran cruises with snorkeling and swimming, talk about being on a deserted desert Island in paradise (why did we come home???).

Very nice pool, nice stretch of beach, grounds were emaculate and overall it was a wonderful property. But the property itself is matched by the terrific staff. From the front desk staff to the concierge to the pool staff to the casino and everyone else, the service was top-notch.

It was wonderfull! I travel A LOT for business and have stayed and many a good hotel. I rate Marriot at Condado beach as one of the best for the service they provide to their guests. Only on a cruise ship have I met such an attentive staff. They went out of their way to please you. The receptionist, the operator, concierge, valet parking, restaurants. Incredible. We can not wait to return. We came back home happy and relaxed feeling like we've been away for weeks thanks to the fact that at this hotel they let me feel totally at ease and without having to worry about anyting. A MUST DO.

We loved the beach and its proximity to the airport and the service was good. We arrived at 9am and was given a corner suite even though the hotel was full. The rooms are just ok, (the air conditioner was pitiful, but made up for its lack of power with tremendous noise) but realistically, for a beach resort in San Juan, it is on the quality side. The biggest draw for us to the Marriott is the beach, being in the middle of Condado beach area is impressive. Just don't expect over the top service or immaculate rooms. The resort is just too big and always too full of guests for the staff to give personal or attentive service. The lobby is always hopping with locals enjoying their music and dances. During the July 4th weekend, a band was performing non stop salsa while locals were clearly enjoying themselves on the dancefloor. This is not a quiet and intimate hotel as the music level was so loud that we had to shout to speak with the front desk. Service at the coffee bar in the lobby was so slow that it was quicker to go across the street (careful not to be run over by maniac drivers on Ashford) to Starbucks. The pool area is a little crowded as they fit many sun loungers into a small space, but the beach is wide open. All around the hotel by the beachfront, the once derelict hotels to the West are being refurnished and the construction noise can be a distraction, but overall, the Marriott is a quality property in that stretch of Condado.", "Date": "July 10, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cnot good\u201d", "Author": "kyamin", "ReviewID": "UR2240887", "Content": "we stayed two nights at the Marriott,it was not good.

Dannys, a block to your left as you leave the hotel has a great breakfast, Buno Ayres restaurant was not worth the money. Tony Romas Ribs is a good walk but good.

Then you may like it here. I have to say. I was one of 38 people that flew over from the stated fo a wedding. Several people stayed at at the Marriotts in Isle Verde and Condodo, I am telling you about the Condodo location, I stayed in Puerto Rico for 10 days and the Marriott ruined one night of that for myself and others, I had a bad experience in the casino with manager on April 27, 2004. This is a ruff version. You see when 5 of us walked up to the lobby bar to order drinks, they sent us to the casino to get service, So we did, We then waited at that casino bar to get service. Guess What ??No service. The manager told us if we wanted to get service then we would have to play slots.OK!! So we did. 45min. passed NO Service, I asked the manager why we couldn't get some drinks. You'll love this. The manager told me that we were play the wrong slot to get service, Then he walked away. I went to the front desk to put a complaint in with the manager of the hotel, but he never showed. I told the girl at the front desk I will be writting Tripadvisor with a poor score for this hotel. So 3 of us left the hotel to go back to ours (THE WINDCHIMES GREAT!!!!) The 2 that were left behind were still playing in the casino$$$ and when they went back to there room they were met by security and they were told because I!!!! was reporting them to Tripadvisor they would have to leave. They then called the bride and groom woke them up to see if they could stay with them I guess everything work it's self out by 3:00am. But I cant tell you how unprofessional, the Marriott's staff was and is. Then Puerto Ricans DEPEND!!!on the $$$$$ from the people who come to there Island, and I can tell 38 people bring in a whole lot of money for them. So I guess the I can tell you I WILL NEVER! EVER! stay at a Marriott !! Even though I did not stay here, I should have been treated as a in house guest would have, with respect and kindness and no less.

My family enjoyed the facilities completely, the tennis courts, pool and the beach. It is a public beach, not maintained by the hotel. All beaches on the island are public beaches. The lobby throbs (rocks) with excitement each evening. The poolside area is also filled with music on the week-ends. The restaurants are overated but worth a try........there are alot of other choices so don't limit yourself to the hotel menus. Try Da Luigi in Santurce.

We were on the 19th floor with a half-ocean, half-city view. The room was always clean, but was small, with a comfortable bed and furnishings. Yes, the lobby rocks on weekend nights, and we stopped briefly to watch the dancing, though no one can talk above the music. However, we could not hear the lobby or casino sounds on our floor or in our room. Food in the Vista restaurant was very good; we did not try Anthony's. The lobby coffee shop makes excellent sandwiches and has great pasteries--at a fair price. There are many excellent restaurants within a block or two, a Walgreen's yards away for necessities, and a bus stop outside the hotel for the 15-minute (25 cents) ride to the old city. Every staff person we encountered was gracious, many asking whether there was anything we needed. The pool area was busy, but we always found lounge chairs somewhere. The large fountain pool, one of two pools, helps mask the people sounds, making poolside snoozes easy. Forget the hotel promo that you can swim laps in the pool; you can't. We stayed during very windy weather, so beach swimming was impossible. My only complaint is the amount of litter on the beach during the day; I blame careless guests. The beach is cleaned nightly. As other reviewers note, the Condado area has several derelict hotels, the lasting result of a devastating hurricane a few years ago. But elegant shops and a wide variety of restaurants on tree-lined Condado streets make up for a few blighted and under-construction areas.
