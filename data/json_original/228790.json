The room was stylishly decorated, bathroom small but modern. We requested a balcony overlooking the avenue de l'opera and got one - wow! Met our son who was staying in a hostel with friends for a drink in the bar and it was a hip and happening place. We had a very nice dinner in the restaurant and thought what a great hotel. Saturday and Sunday the restaurant was closed!!??!! My son wanted to check into the hotel for the Sunday night and even though they knew we were already guests of the hotel they would not budge on a very exprensive rate, so he went back to his hostel and booked a room online with booking.com at a much cheaper rate. When he arrived at the hotel on Sunday he tried to order a club sandwich from the room service menu. The kitchen could not make one. He chose something else and they didn't have that either so he went elsewhere. We had breakfast on two mornings. The first morning a mature woman organised an \"express breakfast\" and we received it promptly. The second morning a young waitress didn't know what service was. The buffet wasn't replenished and at times no staff were in the breakfast room. On sunday night we asked the staff at the front desk to recommend a restaurant (shops and many restaurants are closed on a Sunday in Paris) and we walked to the one they recommended only to find it was closed on a Sunday. If the hotel is not going to open its own restaurant then they should at least know what is open in the area. This hotel has the perfect location and beautiful rooms.

Look to the right and the Louvre is there, perhaps 8-10 blocks down. The concierge staff are all first class! Each is extremely helpful and passionate about helping us experience the best of Paris. Special thanks to Billy, Franceso, Moussa, and Renau. The hotel is stylishly decorated. Our room - a Deluxe - was a bit small, but certainly comfortable enough for two people. We had to ask for a kettle, and then had to supply our our own tea, milk and sugar. The pillows on our king bed were also king sized...they seem to be the type that would usually be used for decoration on a large bed. Made sleeping more difficult than it should be. In fairness though, I didn't ask for smaller pillows, which might well have been available. Our package at 290 Euro's included breakfast and in room internet for the week. Quite good value given Paris prices! Breakfast was adequate, though the staff were dramatically different from the Concierge team. Although we ate there every morning for seven mornings, it was like being a stranger each time. Rarely a smile, and food that was depleted wasn't replenished in a timely way.

The \"king\" bed was two twin beds with separate foundations pushed alongside one another - on the elegant hardwood floor, they quickly slid apart so there was no option to sleep in the middle, only one side or the other.

But my worries were quickly washed away. I can write so many nice things about this hotel, but almost nothing negative. The staffs were warm, disciplined, dedicated, and they had pride in taking care of their guests. We stayed in a suite, which was a beautiful room and very very clean. There was a box of Pierre Herme's macarons waiting for us in the room. We had a balcony with an awesome view of the Opera house. Eventhough the hotel is located on a very busy street, once you close the windows, it is so quiet that you forget where you are. In the room, I never heard our neighbors, nor voices from the corridor. I believe that the building is classic, but the interiors are updated and very comfortable. Hot water and running water was great, and I liked the bathrobe and luxury slippers. I had wi-fi service in my room and was walking around with my IPAD. I stayed for 6 nights, and my first 2 nights were on business, followed by a vacation welcoming my mother and daughter. Edouard VII is a great hotel for both business and holiday purposes. The location is so convenient. You can walk to Louvre museum, to rue St. Honore where the luxury boutiques are, and to Gallerie Lafayette and Printemps. Its also walking distance to Concorde, Vendome, and Champ Elysees. Metro station is just minutes away, and you have easy access to two stations, Pyramides and Opera. Our accomadation came with breakfast, so we ate at the dining room every morning. The buffet were same, but it tasted great and we never got tired. We could have had breakfast in our room, but we preferred to enjoy the nice ambience of the dining room downstairs. If you are searching to find a nice hotel in Paris that will make your trip most enjoyable and relaxing, I would definitely recommend Edouard VII. I have met with the general manager who is a beautiful and wonderful lady, and I could tell that fine hotels depend on the GM greatly. The only downside is the fitness room which was very small. If you need a swimming pool and hyper fitness facilities, then you may find it lacking. I myself often choose hotels with great fitness facilities, but not this time.

My wife and I initially had a hard time deciding on a hotel for our trip to Paris. It was my wife's first time there and I wanted our 5 days in Paris to be a memorable occasion in the best possible hotel, but I did not want to break the bank on a hotel to the point where I wouldn't be able to afford anything once we got there! A very close friend of mine, who is a travel agent, suggested this hotel, telling me that it's by far the \"best bang for your buck\". I took his advice and still haven't stopped thanking him every time I talk to him! For starters, this hotel is in a perfect location. Located right next to the Opera in the heart of Paris, we were within walking distance of the Louvre, the Jardin des Tuileries, the Galeries Lafayette, and many other sites. The nearby metro, a 2-minute walk from the front door, is a central hub from which we were able to get to virtually any destination (including the airport) with zero or, at most, only one connection (\"correspondance\", as they call it in French). I cannot begin to account for all the Euros that we saved on taxis as a result of this hotel's convenient location! Next, the rooms: while I cannot speak for every room in the hotel (we obviously only stayed in one room for our 5-day stay), I can tell you that our room was absolutely beautiful. It was immaculately clean, loaded with amenities (a nice minibar with a useful refrigerator, a free convenient safe, several closets, high-speed wifi access, really lavish towels, soaps, creams, and other bathroom amenities, and, best of all, one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in. (In fact, my wife and I had trouble getting up every morning to see Paris because of how great those pillows and blankets were!) And, unlike every other hotel, whose rooms seem to be decorated by the same person, the Edouard 7 hotel seems to pride itself in being uniquely designed, from the colors to the patterns to the architecture. Our room was breathtakingly designed with rich colors everywhere, and the use of space, sloping ceilings, and little balconies overlooking Avenue de l'Opera really made it such a fun stay. And, I must point out that I'm not even talking about a luxury suite or anything! We stayed in a regular room. So, I can only imagine what would await someone who upgraded to a luxury suite! If I had one complaint at all, though, it was just that the wi-fi connection required a sign-on process that limited me to only one device connecting at one time, so I had to keep signing on and off to switch between my laptop and my iPhone as needed. Hopefully, they will reconsider that approach before my next visit (and yes, I do intend to stay there every time I visit Paris from now on!). But, I saved the best part for last: the service. The staff working at Edouard 7 is really dedicated to making the stay perfect. They really made us feel so welcome, and were there for every question, every request... everything. Their genuine concern for our having a memorable stay in Paris was very comforting and we relied on them for many of our \"touristy\" things, like getting advance tickets to the different sites to avoid long lines, which was an amazing timesaver (for example, with their help, we were able to avoid the hour-long lines at the Eiffel Tower, and were able to literally walk right into the elevator and ride up to the top). And, I have to say, that I am often the \"self-reliable\" type, and don't often turn to concierges for help, but in this hotel I felt very comfortable going to them any time I had any questions or needs. In short, I can't say enough about this amazing hotel and its incredibly friendly staff. As my friend told me before my trip: it is clearly the best bang for your buck, and you will actually be sad when you check out! I am already looking forward to another visit to Paris--and another stay at the Edouard 7.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cNearly Perfect Accommodations For A First Trip To Paris\u201d", "Author": "NYYStadiumInsider", "ReviewID": "UR107520022", "Content": "What can I say that hasn't already been said in all of the other reviews? Hotel Edouard 7 is a great hotel, with a perfectly central location, in an amazing city. My wife and I spent six nights at Hotel Edouard in March 2011 during our first trip to Paris. We couldn't have picked a better place to rest our heads. If you like to be surprised by the intricate details of a beautiful boutique hotel, you can stop reading here, knowing you'll have a great stay. Otherwise, I have plenty more to share! We were upgraded to one of the \"Couture Collection\" rooms, (No. 502) which featured a balcony overlooking Avenue de L'Opera with a stunning view of the Opera House in one direction and Hotel Du Luvre in the other direction. The room definitely had a \"lovers\" theme, with red velvet walls, drapes and furniture - it's very easy for this type of room to come off cheesy, but at Hotel Edouard 7 it is tastefully executed. Room 502 features a spacious layout with the main sleeping room separated from the foyer, bathroom and toilet room. The bathroom boasts modern fixtures, a heated towel rack, a beautiful soaking tub and a standing shower with a \"rainshower\" shower head. I'd love to give both the bath and shower glowing reviews, but it is definitely a case of form over function. For whatever reason, we all kinds of trouble getting hot water for more than one bath or shower, especially if we showered during off peak times (such as in the afternoon). I definitely took a few cold showers - unacceptable when paying a few hundred dollars per night for a hotel room. Also, the caulking for the standing shower was shoddy, causing a puddle on the bathroom floor. Finally, the heated towel rack only worked randomly and not on demand (there was a knob on the rack that was supposed to control the heat, but it didn't work). The separate room with the toilet was very small, but the toilet worked flawlessly and had a very powerful flush, so nothing to complain about there. The main sleeping room has an amazingly comfortable king-sized bed with down comforters and pillows that will make you never want to awake from your slumber. A comfortable bed is of the utmost importance in a hotel room and this one didn't disappoint. Although there is a large balcony facing the bustling Avenue de L'Opera, the doors and windows are made of extremely thick, soundproof glass which keeps out the noise. Just like the towel rack in the bathroom, the heater in the room didn't work on demand - although there was a knob that was supposed to control the room's temperature. We were lucky enough to have warm temperatures during our stay (low 60's), but at night, we could have used a bit of heat. A small table with two chairs and desk space directly under the TV were welcome additions to the room, especially since accommodations in Paris are known to be cramped. Unfortunately, there wasn't much drawer space to store clothes in. There was a large closet with ample hanging space, but non-hanging items were relegated to a couple of shelves, one of which contained mini-bar items. Speaking of the mini-bar, it is located within the aforementioned closet and because it is refrigerated, it gives off a lot of heat. At times, I was worried that there wasn't enough ventilation, but nothing burst into flames, so no complaints there. The service at this hotel is top notch. The workers are trained professionals and will bend over backwards to satisfy their guests. Raphael was especially pleasant during our stay - always greeting us with a smile, and answering any of the many questions that we had. If you're an American who is scared of visiting Paris because you heard Parisians aren't too friendly - don't be. This was some of the best service my wife and I ever received. Some random hotel notes: - The hotel has wi-fi, but in order to connect you need to request a card containing a username and password from the front desk. The wi-fi was extremely shoddy in room 502 (probably because it is on a high floor), but the speed was fine. Annoyingly, the internet connection times out after a certain amount of inactivity, which means constantly re-entering the overly long usernames and passwords. - The restaurant attached to the hotel offers a buffet breakfast for 25 Euros which isn't worth the cost of admission. The food is fine, but no breakfast is worth that much money. - The hotel's elevator is extremely small and fits at most 3-4 people. If you're claustrophobic, you might want to request a room on a lower floor so you can take the stairs. Overall, this is a great hotel and one that we'd return to without thinking twice.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, UK", "Title": "\u201cThe only place I'd now stay at in Paris\u201d", "Author": "Nickpala", "ReviewID": "UR102156948", "Content": "This is a great hotel.

If you like modern, then you select to stay in the Couture decor. One of my biggest disappointments were most of the other hotels all have very modern rooms. I wanted to stay in a room that felt like Paris inside too! The Edouard 7 Hotel also offered the Classic decor room! Beautifully decorated with wooden floors, chocolates and canolope colors, a towel warmer in the bathroom (along with a tub AND shower!). BUT the view....I had a balcony that looked down at one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever seen, the Opera House! In addition, the hotel lobby, restaurant and bar are decorated with an unique style. If you have an appreciation for interior design and creativity then you will love it. The restaurant in the hotel is amazing! The breakfasts were amazing from their fresh baked croissants, fresh squeezed juices to their dinner menu and desserts! If this wasn't enough I have to add the iciing on the cake. The staff was amazing. Everyone was very accomadating, friendly and personable. We befriended several of them. They made our trip perfect. I highly recommend staying at the hotel. We walked every where in Paris and I was really glad we stayed at the Edouard 7 Hotel.
