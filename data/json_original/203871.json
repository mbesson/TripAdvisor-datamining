We could so benefit from a terrific view of the historical center of Florence, every moment we went onto our terrace.We were in a quiet place although close enough to the city (about 15 minutes driving) so as to perform a lot of visits but also enjoying the beauty of Italian landscapes and listening to the song of the crickets.The service was warm and the food excellent.I am sure we'll try to come back to that place.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR113334796", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Paco08"}, {"Content": "perfect honeymoon Loved this pictureque hotel up on the hillside outside of Florence! The estate is very beautiful; walking trails; pool; AMAZING view over Florence. We didn't have any idea it was so far out of town so be ready for the 20 min. bus ride into the city center. The walk to the bus stop took about 5 min though and was very do-able. We had dinner at the restaurant each evening. It was WONDERFUL and VERY worth the expense. Because of the estate's age, it wasn't exactly new modern and pristine but it added to the ambiance.", "Date": "May 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR441915384", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "ffwife"}, {"Content": "Loved the location We had an exceptional holiday at the Villa Rondini just outside Florence. Yes, you do need to do a lot of walking if you are not staying in the villa itself, to and from breakfast, and to the bus stop. However, this was all made clear before we travelled and the location more than made up for the walking! Set in the Tuscan countryside in acres of grounds the hotel offered a haven of peace after the crowds and heat of Florence itself. With reference to the earlier reviews, yes, the place could do with a face lift but we felt this added a certain charm. Our room was large, as was the bathroom, and we had a panoramic view of Florence and the surrounding countryside from our windows and balcony.We only ate in the hotel restaurant one evening as we found it more formal than we like, but the food was excellent. I would stay there again, but be firmer in asking for boiling hot water for my morning tea - the maitre d' could be a little intimidating!", "Date": "Sep 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR984556223", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Sunseeker53"}, {"Content": "Lovely location but needs Loving Care We spent a week at the Villa Le Rondini and had the feeling that this could be a fantastic hotel, given an awful lot of hard work!The bedroom was clean with a nice view over the Tuscan countryside and we can't blame the hotel for the Tuscan mosquitoes, which were pretty active. The air conditioning (essential in August) was noisy but effective. The grounds are very extensive and for us it was great to be able to retreat up into the hills after a hard and hot day's sight-seeing and shoping. We did not eat in a lot as Florence has so much to offer, but the food we did have was good and they do a splendid bistecca fiorentina - enough for three and a carnivore's dream. The general atmosphere was pleasant and the price was good value - so maybe we should not ask for the refurbishment which would turn a perfently acceptable hotel into a great one, but would probably double the price! For a family seeking a pleasant place with laid-back staff and a pool, with a good bus service to the bright lights, this could be just the ticket.", "Date": "Aug 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR987187980", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ChiefWeasel"}, {"Content": "Amore the Hotel This hotel was molto bello!!

It is very quite and the atmosphere drips with country charm. My room was in a seperate building quite a way from the main bldg. The exterior of this building lacked all charm. Access into the building and to my floor required navigating steps and a long dreary hall. You must carry your own luggage. The room was very tiny but I thought it was really cute and cheerful. It was decorated with country furniture and country fabrics. The bathroom had been remodeled. Yes, it could use fresh paint, etc. but it does have its own charm. On the downside it is not walking distance to Florence at all. It is up in the hillside outside of town so it is a drive. I think that it is great for the quite and charm but not so good for being able to just walk out your door and wander around town. It has the grounds and design to be a great country hotel, it is just not there now.", "Date": "Mar 23, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR719583545", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "cam33"}, {"Content": "Huge potential, but still some work to do We've stayed at Villa Le Rondini for 5 nights, touring Firenze and Toscana. The location on a green hill just outside the city of Firenze lets you enjoy the taste of Toscana and still have easy access to the city. It is recommended to get to the city by bus (#25 every 15-20 minutes), and to tour Toscana by car (free parking at the hotel). The hotel resides in a large property, and includes a main building and a couple of villas. Keep in mind that if your room is in one of the villas - you'll have to walk (or drive) 200-300 meters to have breakfast in the main building. Our room looked a bit worn out with overused furniture. The bathroom looked better - renovated lately. Service was not perfect: Our room wasn't made up one of the days, and it was pretty frustrating coming back at night after an exhausting day and finding it messy. Breakfast wasn't rich - yellow cheese was there only one day, The bread was usually dry. *** Bottom line: Villa Le Rondini did not live up to our expectations. It has a huge potential thanks to its location, size and view, but the staff has to make an extra effort making the rooms look better and taking care of the small details, or else it doesn't seem they deserve 4 stars.", "Date": "Apr 26, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR219957928", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "\u6910\u546b\u4eb1\u9288\u5910\u6d1f\u9288\u5c7b\u4ef8\u9287\u52e9\u5020\u9287\ue1ba\u4ef9...   showReview(21803023, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR712270133", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Dopo un iniziale scontento...   showReview(12650403, 'full');", "Date": "May 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR818837004", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\u66d8\u5045\u9289\ue0fe\u5142\u9289\u4f75\u504b\u9287\ue1ba\u505f\u9289\u70bd\u506a...   showReview(21802483, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR662200197", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4f05\u6910\u546b\u4eb1\u9288\u5908\u4f04\u6d5c\u3089\u20ac?..   showReview(21802339, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR186778260", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9479\ue218\u4e9c\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4ef9\u9286\u4f78\u3047\u5a67\u20ac\u74d2?..   showReview(21802298, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR280170812", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d203871-r20806675-Ville_Le_Rondini-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "203871", "Price": "$190"}}
