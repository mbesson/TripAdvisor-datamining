Instead of the \"suite\" I purchased they wanted to give me a standard room. I said no here is my order with the suite I ordered... Next they tell me ok fine we will give you the suite, but you have to pay. I already stated I paid and here is the paperwork and receipt of payment, they tell me to call cheapostay again...I shouldn't even be calling since they are the ones with the errors...I ended up leaving as it would of taken 3 hours and it was already 11pm...After finally talking with cheapostay, I tell them I left and I want my refund. They agreed and I was only charged 10 dollars until I stayed, then the rest would be charged. I look at my account the next day and the hotel charged me 97.18!

The inside of the hotel is rundown, dirty and lacking in security. Service was terrible. I would not recommend this hotel to my enemy. My wife and I thought we were getting a steal for about $115 a night for a room with a whirlpool. Wow, were we wrong! The room had numerous stains on the ceiling. It smelled very musty and reeked of cleaning chemicals. We opened the window to air it out, which helped, but the bathroom never lost its rank odor. (We prebooked three nights -- big mistake!) Each additional night we stayed there, the more stains I noticed in the room. There was gum stuck on the bed's headboard along with various carvings from prior guests. Basically, the room looked as if it hadn't been maintained at all for at least a year. But the condition of the room was just the beginning of our problems. The hotel is in a very bad part of town and nowhere near any attractions. I found it bizarre that this supposedly high-end hotel was located in such a poor area with no other hotels anywhere nearby. Worst of all, though, is the utter lack of security. We heard loud fights in rooms nearby. One night about 5 or 6 young men who appeared to be gang members sat down in the middle of the hallway near our room and stayed there for several hours, with no appearance by management. Late at night it was the norm to encounter shady characters wandering the hotel hallways. We started propping a chair in front of our door at night. To add to the nightmare, the lock on the room door was faulty and did not always lock when it closed, so when leaving we had to fiddle with it until it locked. Amazingly, even the poor security was not the worst part of our experience! The worst part was the utter lack of cleaning service. No one performed any cleaning whatsoever during our three-day stay. Our second night we had to call the front desk three times just to get some clean towels and sheets. The third night we decided not to even bother. The absolute worst of all was the dingy fitted bedsheet we were forced to use during our stay. It was so worn out that it constantly pulled off the mattress so that I woke up 5 or 6 times every night to the pleasant sensation of bare mattress under my skin (and God only knows what nastiness was on that mattress, given the dinginess of the rest of the room). We ended up using some pins we had brought with us to pin the sheet to the mattress, but even that did not work very well. I have never stayed at a hotel that did not even have a sheet that fit the mattress. Lastly, there was no Internet access in the rooms. To gain access, you had to take your computer down to the lobby, navigating the unsafe hallways with a $2,000 computer in hand. The only positive to our stay was that the whirlpool worked adequately, but we hardly used it because of the revolting condition of the rest of the room. Even the continental breakfast was subpar and poorly stocked. We didn't use the pool, but it looked dirty. We felt fortunate that our car wasn't broken into during our stay. Don't be fooled by pictures of the outside of this hotel. Perhaps in its prime this was a nice place to spend a weekend, but in the present day it is dingy and neglected. Do whatever it takes to stay far, far away from this hotel!", "Date": "March 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "rotherham,england", "Title": "\u201cvery disappointed\u201d", "Author": "royj", "ReviewID": "UR13621700", "Content": "i have sent a complaint to Expedia about this hotel and a review after they sent me an e-mail asked if i would review the hotel,i told them that the place looks nice from the outside and the young lady who checked us in was pleasent and very helpful,but after that oh dear,both Expedia and the hotels own website describe the corporate king room has having large screen tv`s,in-room safes,clock radios,irons,hair dryers,the corporate king we had was lacking in all these items,the small telly had 39 channels but only 20 had a watchable picture,the in-room safe was a hole in the carpet,no clock radio,no iron or ironing board,but to be fair there is no mention of a ironing board anyway,there was on the wall a holder for a iron,as for the hair dryer no sign of one of them either,the bottom sheet on the bed ended up in the middle of the bed on both nights because it was so small,the two men we spoke to at reception were just there to hold the seat from floating away,we asked one if the little havana area in miami was ok to visit and he kept going on about some restaurant with the same name,then it was breakfast time,being english we liked to have a drink of tea with our breakfast(not too much to ask is it)but no hot water never mind any tea bags,when my wife asked about this she was told the hotel has nothing to do with breakfast and should talk to the catering contractor about this,i read there was no place to eat close by but did not expect to have to travel so far to see anywhere to eat,if you are going to Miami either spend less money or more money and stay somewhere other than this place!.", "Date": "February 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cDiamond in the rough\u201d", "Author": "KC001", "ReviewID": "UR7757950", "Content": "First things first.

I immediately came out and approached another housekeeper, who informed that she was sending someone right away. I waited for another 45 minutes, still no one.
