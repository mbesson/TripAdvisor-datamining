Our room was tiny, on opening the door you were practically already on the bed, which was pushed against the opposite wall. The bathroom however was spacious and very clean. There was no refrigerator in our room which I find inconvenient as I take medication that requires refrigeration. We were located on the 6th floor and were only a meter or so away from the elevator which meant that you could clearly hear late night guests walking along the corridor which was not carpeted,and you could also hear their conversations as they walked by, the walls seemed to be paper thin! The elevator motor was also audible, not the best room for a quite nights sleep! On a positive note, the 6Euro breakfast was good for the price, providing more than your usual bread and pastries.Overall this place was very clean, but small, I was not happy about the level of \"internal\"noise, but maybe that was just the room we had.

The impression given by the staff member was indifferent \"No one else has complained\".. but I hadn't said that I thought the heating wasn't working in all the rooms. The heater made a noise but no air came out....... I do know when something isn't working! On returning the next day, an electrician was in our room. He said that the heating was broken and that we should be given another room. Reception initially offered a twin room. I declined that and mysteriously a double was then available. This room was fine. As we exited the lift next day, the indifferent receptionist was handing out blankets to two guests! Bet they'd been given room 201! Having said this, if you get a warm room, the hotel isn't bad. Clean and modern, rooms are small but the price is good. Breakfast was ok, a cold buffet. Well sited for The Ramblas.

For a 2 star hotel we thought it perfect: rooms are clean, large and clean bathrooms, beds are okay, airco, TV with multiple channels, free internet acces in room, small safe, big cupboard, basic but okay breakfast, nice staff. Situated in a busy area with the museum of modern art in the back, as well as some university buildings and with small bars and restaurants in the front. The area and surroundings are 'busy', therefore at night you hear street sounds. In the back you hear skateboarders which skate around the museum of modern art. At 3 a.m. the whole block in front of this museum is cleaned with a large machine. In the front of the hotel you'll find people from the cafes and restaurants hanging out. All sounds that are common in big cities. With windows closed (and airco when needed) it is 'do-able'! We have not felt unsafe around the hotel, just loved all the people walking by, enjoyed the nice and good cafes and restaurants nearby. We felt safe at all times, even though we saw about 7 police officers pick up 2 guys Sundaymorning, 6.30 am...!. There are lots of police officers everywhere and it is a big city. Something you will need to consider in any city. From the hotel it is easy to walk to all the places down town you want to see; perfect location in an upcoming area with lots of small (second hand & vintage) shops, lots of barbers and small (multi cultural) restaurants. Front rooms face the busy, narrow street with bars and restaurants (numbers 5,6,7). The rooms in the back of the hotel either face a blind wall (less noise??) or look out on the square in front of the Modern Art museum (1, 2, 3). Top floor and the back side of the hotel is the best / most quiet (we think).

The hotel is comfy and very clean, we didn't have breakfast so can't comment. Rooms aren't large but for a city break they were addiquite, there was plenty storage for your clothes. If I was going to have a complaint then it would be that there was no kettle in room, but we knew this and took our own. We went to Girona for the day ,a nice day out and easy to reack in an hour and a half. The last thing a would like to touch on is the crime in Barcelona, do not be afraid to go as I never once saw any violence but do watch out for pickpockets. On our second night 2 metres from hotel we were targeted, he asked us where we were from then did we like judo.

This time I emailed the hotel a few weeks before our stay to request a room overlooking the rear of the hotel and we were delighted upon arrival to be given the keys to room 501 with a view of MACBA (at the rear of the hotel). The room was even larger than the one we previously stayed in, and again had a well sized bathroom. There was some noise especially in the evenings as the area around MACBA becomes very busy with skateboarders but we enjoyed being so close to the hustle and bustle, and most of the noise was eliminated when the balcony doors were shut. There was also some additional noise on our second day and for the remainder of our stay when some builders arrived and started to dig a large trench in the square at the back of the hotel, they did however finish around 8pm every night so we did not find this a major problem. The room was cleaned and towels changed each day and we found the room was always spotless. We did notice that since our stay in 2007, the decor has aged slightly and there were areas in the room that could have done with a lick of paint, mainly where suitcases have knocked into the walls, and the mirror in the bathroom had some water damage to it, but this is the only bad thing I can find to write! We booked our room with breakfast and there was a fantastic selection of food every day, including cereals, meats, cheese, yoghurts, fruit, pastries, breads and cakes , available until 10am, so we were able to have a welcome lie in. Location was fantastic for exploring on foot, with La Rambla only a 5 minute walk away and lots of interesting narrow streets nearby with bars, restaurants and shops on the doorstep. Also only a 5 minute walk to 'Universitat' metro station which enabled quick and easy access to anywhere in this fantastic city. All in all I would definitely recommend this hotel, some reviews mention the area around the hotel as dodgy, but I never felt that this was the case, it is just a typical Barcelona street, it was so busy at all hours of the day and night that we never felt vulnerable and we found the various staff in the local shops (very useful for buying drinks and supplies) extremely friendly and helpful.

Overall i think it was a great stay but we could find something cheaper with the same facilities.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herefordshire", "Title": "\u201cLittle Gem\u201d", "Author": "Gaudifantoo", "ReviewID": "UR39502540", "Content": "Just got back from a 4 day stay in Barcelona .We were attendng a conference had trouble finding a hotel.Booked the Acta BCN 40 and must say this was the best situation I have ever had in Barcelona.The Hotel is very friendly ,rooms clean well furnished with very nice ensuites,fantastic choice at breakfast.For a budget hotel this was special as we really liked being in with the locals-not touristy at all.There are some great restaurants and bars just outside the door and you wont be ripped off.We shall definately go back.", "Date": "September 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turkey", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with strange surrounding\u201d", "Author": "ayakrugzo", "ReviewID": "UR34281604", "Content": "The hotel and the hotel staff was great. Breakfast was fine but since we wanted to be a part of Bar\u00e7a, we only once ate at hotel. When we were in Bar\u00e7a, there was a festival called St. Juan. So there were a lot of firework and noise on the first night. But after it was quite silent. Hotel is situated very close to La Rambla.It's very easy to walk to Rambla. Rates of the hotel is quite suitable. Long story short, i reccomend to this hotel to the people who travel with their friend or as couple not to the families because of the surrounding (enviroment) of the hotel.", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDon't even consider\u201d", "Author": "labarb2000", "ReviewID": "UR32621986", "Content": "Air conditioning system emitted warm musty air; air intake vents filled with filthy lint; desk clerk did nothing to remedy situation; bad neighborhood; better choices close by including Meson Castilla around the corner; wonderful city; don't ruin your trip at this psuedo modernismo dump.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Neots, Cambs", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel Inside but a Shabby Area, Lift kept breaking down\u201d", "Author": "Neil1966", "ReviewID": "UR30787420", "Content": "The street outside the hotel looked very dodgy, i would not fancy walking around the area in the small hours especially for women. The hotel itself is great, very clean and bright in contrast to outside, the reception staff speak perfect English and are only too happy to help, the breakfast was excellent, with plenty of fruit, rolls, cold meats and cheese available, a wide selection of cakes was also included. There are loads of small shops and restaurant/bars in the street and if you turn left outside the hotel and walk toi the end of the street, take another left and you are at La Rambla easily within 7 - 8 mins. Barcelona has loads of things to do and this is a great base to explore from being within a few minutes of a Metro station which is a great method of getting around the city. Overall i would reccommend the Acta 40 but as the lift frequently broke down and we were on the 5th floor it was a bit of a pain.

The Apsis 40 has a very helpful staff. Is is well located within a ten minutre walK from La Rambla. There are many interesting shops and reataurants in the area. Public transportation is nearby.

It appears that they live in crowded rooming houses and have no other place to go. I saw NO threat frfom these guys but some visitors may be uncomfortable. The area is well policed. If your room is at the front of the hotel you will hear considerable noise from the street. Rooms on the sixth floor will get noise all night from the elevator machinery which is located there.

The room was booked through xcapewithus.com which we have used before and found reasonable and hassle free. Upon researching this hotel we found mixed reviews from previous visitors. However, we decided to book due to the fact that the cost was very low. We used the shuttlebus from the airport (7eur rtn) and found the hotel easily with the help of a map (multimap). The street which the hotel is situated does seem seedy but considering the time of year and being 2 females we never felt unsafe with the short walk down the street to the hotel. The reception staff man the entrance 24hrs and permit entrance to residents only. We found the location of the hotel ideal and walked easily to all the sights. 5-8min walk to Las Ramblas. The sink in our room leaked upon arrival and we informed reception staff approx 20min from check in. This was fixed that afternoon - excellent. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Room cleaned daily. The continental breakfast offered great variety and everything was fresh and well presented. We loved the modern rooms with small balconys, and free use of safety deposit box. Also you could access the internet for free if you wished in the reception area.
