We have made some wonderful friendships with several of the long standing staff.Breakfast is fine, if you want bacon and eggs you must pay, which works out to about $2AUThe pool and gardens are fantastic, especially with the swim up bar, what a way to spend and afternoon.We thought about staying at a more up market hotel for our return trip in August and then decided that we were more than happy with the hotel so why pay more for pretty well much of the same.Matahari Bungalow's is and will be out hotel of choice.", "Date": "Mar 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR534447614", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MaynardKalgoorlie"}, {"Content": "Fantastic hotel       Peace in the pool", "Date": "Mar 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR555179392", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Moochsta"}, {"Content": "Try to Forget about it... We stayed at this hotel for 5 days and believe me, this hotel was not pleasant at all.Our room was at the edge of the third floor.

I booked the hotel from Australia through the Travelagent. Unfortunately they didn't know anything about Matahari Bungalows in Kuta, so we decided the website and photos looked okay for a Budget Hotel, as we were only staying 4 nights before flying back home. We first stayed for 12 nights in Amed on the East coast and thought it would be good to be closer to the airport and sort out the shopping in those last days.We were very disappointed when we arrived. The Deluxe Room we booked looked nothing like the nice photo in their brochure. I wished I had taken photos right then, but I was stunned to say the least, we didn't even unpack.The bathroom was filthy, the toilet had not been cleaned, there was still a brown substance  dried to the seat, hairs and various unidentifyable stuff on the floor as well. The beds, especially the pillows (though they looked clean ), smelled of someone elses old sweat, the whole room was not swept clean. The place was plain,old, no colour, no care, no decorations, grey horse blankets with sheets which were trying to look white, not anything Deluxe  to be seen...I felt sorry for the people staying in the Standard rooms!We went for an upgrade, $20 each per night for a suite, which was cleaner, but it kept raining through the ceiling on to the very slippery tiles. It got eventually fixed, after complaints, complaints and many towels later...Oh, feel like some complementary water for a drink or to clean your teeth? Well, forget it, the super mini fridge is empty, every day. I broke a glass, one of the only two in the whole suite with kitchen and bathroom...I cleaned up the obvious bits with my last towel, but the tiny other fragments were still there the next day after letting reception know about it. (I wanted to avoid injuries to staff, as they rarely wore shoes) Nearly everything is broken, dirty or missing but nothing is getting fixed, Care and Maintenance are words with no meaning in this place. Concerns and complaints were met with blank stares, I had the feeling we were merely tolerated to be there, even though we were paying much more than we originally wanted, just for a cleaner room.The staff was trying, but just smiling doesn't help when there is a problem. I thought that the Management was rather arrogant in their attitude. When my friends credit card was swallowed by the ATM machine, they wanted to charge us 65.000 rupiah for a reverse call to Australia. Alltogether, they were not helpful at all, I just had the feeling no one cared.And don't get me started on the Breakfast, the tables were not cleaned after Hotel Guests left, so you had to sit down with the last person's crumbs, though there was staff standing around. And eggs? You're kidding me, they're extra...the buffet  consisted of grey rice with not a vegetable in sight, toast,jam, coffee, and fruit with flies, or was that flies with the fruit? So we gave up on that too and went elsewhere to eat.I didn't expect too much of a Budget place, but this topped my worst imagination. I do not believe they know the meaning of Customer Service, understand the paying tourist or have any communication skills.Not a place for eldery people either, no handrails leading up the slippery tiled stairs to the suites. To be fair, the garden and pool area was nice, but is there anything really good to say at all about this place? For us, it was  Good Bye  and never again.PS: I feel rather silly now putting up with a Hotel that we were so disappointed with, next time we will contact the Tour Operator...they assured us they would have found us another place of equal value, so take the reading glasses and read the fine print on your vouchers!!!", "Date": "Jan 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR649389399", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "coastar"}, {"Content": "location okay? nice pool.... room??? not sure If you want to shop then the location is good as it is right in the middle of the Kuta shopping area.

Don't let looks deceive you!Although we spent only one night there, it was a restless night. The walls of the rooms are paper thin (made of rattan). The person next to our room had his TV on till 3am and though the volume wasn't loud, it felt as if he was watching it in our room! Breakfast was a pathetic spread - bread (a broken toaster was provided), noodles, and crepes (which was replenished at an exceptionally slow pace).To be fair, the layout and design of the hotel is nice but it is easily overshadowed by the poor service. On checking out, we chose to pay in US$ instead of Rupiah but were told we could only settle our bill in Rupiah.
