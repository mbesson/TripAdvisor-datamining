On the staff at the hotel- from the second you arrived until the moment you left the staff could not do enough for you- everyone was very friendly and helpful. We stayed in a suite with a garden view and it was lovely. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was on the luxurious side and the room was very clean. Every time we popped out the room was obviously spruced up and new towels left. A nice touch was the little notes left on the bed by the turning down service. On the Spa- as it is a smaller hotel I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and size of the spa. A trip (or two) to the spa is a must if staying at this hotel. We ate out every day so cannot comment too much on the food, however the one lunch we had at the hotel was very nice. One tip for smokers- you cannot buy cigarettes at night.

But the hotel seems mostly understaffed as they seem to have severe service problems both at dinner and at breakfast. Breakfast... I could not believe what I saw in a 5* hotel: prosciutto cotto ( cooked ham) of the worse quality. This kind of reconstructed ham that only second class pizzerias put on top of a pizza. The salami was so bad that my son that always its it at breakfast in hotels in italy refused to eat it. The bread was missing anything fresh and was all dry and chewy and even our mexican guest asked if they did not have better (fresh ?) bread (we fortunately got it without any problems at Al Covo restaurant in Venice for lunch). Marmalades ? there where only 3 to choose from, forget the popular strawberry as they did not have it. The selection of cheese was minimalistic. And so it goes on.

What a culture shock! We came from an environment where anything you wanted was provided to a hotel where it appeared that they would love it if they didn't have to have guests. First the good stuff. The hotel itself is beautiful. Across the lagoon from St Marks it provided a real oasis of calm. It has a wonderful perfumed garden where you can sit and read. The hotel building itself is also calm and peaceful with a huge central room where candles and a fire are lit at night. Our room was across the garden away from the main building (it was really quiet) and was quite contemporary with wooden floors and loads of windows and a large bathroom with a separate shower. Next the bad stuff bearing in mind the star rating of this hotel. When our group arrived we sat down on rows of chairs as if we were in a meeting. We had arrived in Venice 3 hours earlier and been taken on a tour to fill in some time but were not offered a drink of any description. Having been provided with the hotel shuttle launch timetable we were more or less told to go away until 2.30 when our rooms would be ready. Some fellow travelers tried to get lunch but gave up having waited 45 mins for a waiter to appear to be told that he would do his best to serve them. There were no other guests around.! On the hotel web site it says that water and prosecco are provided for guests to help themselves. When 2 members of our group took advantage of this they were told it didn't apply to groups. Are we not a guest if we arrive with more than a certain number of other people? The hotel could not provide maps and suggested we bought them at the shop next door. Breakfast was due to start at 7.00 am but the waiters didn't begin to set the tables outside until 8.00 am on the mornings we were there and in fact discouraged guests from eating outside by closing the doors into the courtyard! 'Normal' guests had a noon check out but our group, some of which were not leaving until early evening, had to check out at 10 with no option to stay in the room. Considering that this is supposed to be one of the best hotels in Venice this is not the way that I would expect them to treat their guests.

Well, the canals had no smell, we got lucky with the heat, and with our choice of hotel we trumped the crowd problem. We stayed six nights at the Bauer Palladio, housed in a former 16th century convent designed by the great architect Andrea Palladio. The waterfront hotel is on the Guidecca, the long, narrow island separated from St. Mark's Square and Venice's central islands by its widest canal. Relatively few visitors make it to this island, since there's only one attraction in the guide books, the Redentore church. So the crowds are across the water and most of the foot traffic along the quay is in the early morning or evening hours when the island's residents go to and return from work. But the Bauer has its own launch to take guests to the Grand Canal jetty of its sister hotel, the Bauer Hotel and Palazzo, itself a 3-minute walk from St. Mark's Square. The boat runs every 30 minutes from 10 a.m., the last return trip at 11:50 p.m. A ferry landing, served by four different lines, is less than 100 yards from the hotel's front door. So Venice's delights--and crowds--are just a 5-minute boat-ride away. Indoors, the hotel has a spacious and elegant lounge; a sunny breakfast room with shaded outdoor tables to which guests can bring food from the decent buffet; a restaurant, with a small bar, that we did not try; and a well-appointed spa where my wife got an \"excellent\" massage. Our peaceful room was a good size for Venice, with efficient AC and simple yet classy furnishings, a very comfortable bed and a pleasant bathroom with locally made herbal bath amenities. (One nuisance: A too-short shower screen made it impossible to keep water off the floor.) WiFi was included and worked well. Service was excellent and polite, though sometimes a bit hectic at breakfast. (One morning--an exception--it took 45 minutes to get a capuccino. Imagine--in Italy!) Requests for ice or extra towels always arrived in under 10 minutes. The smiling ladies at the front desk, mostly from eastern Europe, greeted us every time we passed, were efficient on every booking or restaurant confirmation we asked of them and were amazing in their command of languages--six in the case of Marina. Undoubtedly, a big part of the pleasure of this hotel is its location. The Guidecca is unassuming but full of charm and calm, narrow alleys running across the breath of the island among what look like blocks of low-cost residential apartments, offering a glimpse of everyday life; buildings rapidly be built or repurposed as luxury flats for foreigners away much of the time; boatyards and some spectacular views of the southern lagoon; a few convenience stores and one pocket supermarket; several pizza restaurants, a break-the-bank branch of the famous Harry's Bar and one hugh-end restaurant, I Figli Delle Stelle; a sprinkling of bars from whose quayside tables you can watch, a glass of cool wine or a \"spritz\" in hand, the passing varieties of ferries and other boats; gigantic cruise liners being tugged through the canal to their berths, dwarfing the entire city; and the sleek sea-going luxury yachts of the super-rich, so big that they barely move at anchor.

I am already planning our return. We loved the location: on the island of Giudecca (next to the fabled Cipriani Hotel but at a fraction of the price), the Bauer Palladio is an oasis of stylish calm and tranquility that was especially welcome after a day of sight-seeing among the mobs of people across the lagoon. Giudecca is unhurried, uncrowded, with open spaces and breezes from the wide lagoon. I am puzzled by some other reviewers' complaints about their problems with the travel between the hotel and Venice \"proper\". A vaporetto (public transport water bus) runs about every 10 minutes, from early in the morning until the wee hours and the transfer time is 5 minutes. True, it's a bit pricey (Venice charges tourists an outrageous 6.50 per ride fee, quite a bit higher than what locals pay), but you can buy passes for unlimited rides for 12-, 24-, 48- or 72-hours, or by the week. With a little planning, you really don't need to pay for any transfers, just use the hotel shuttle eco boat (which DOES indeed exist, but on the one day it rained the hotel had hired a taxi boat for the transfers, I suppose the weather affects its operation). The hotel launch left at 10, 11 and noon each morning for the 5-minute ride, with service resuming 4 pm every hour until midnight (with 2 trips per hour from 5 until 8pm), so quite easy to have a night out in the main part of the city if one wished. We found it worked well to enjoy a leisurely breakfast in the beautiful gardens and then head into the touristic center for 5 or 6 hours of sight-seeing, after which we were relieved to return to the serenity of Giudecca. Finding our way back to the shuttle dock was no problem, we just made a note of the location when we first arrived. But even had we not, it's at the rather well-known Hotel Bauer and Bauer Palazzo, which are easily found on maps or by asking shop keepers in the area. Certainly no more challenging than finding your way back to ANY hotel among the narrow labyrinth of streets in Venice! We really viewed being removed from the heat, the crowds and the noise of central Venice as a massive \"plus\". The hotel would be easy to miss if you didn't know it was there, as the facade is the marble front of a 500-year-old church and convent. The hotel was indeed at one time a convent, lovingly and beautifully restored after a century of neglect. The only exterior indication that it's a hotel is a discreet brass plaque beside the door - a very classy touch in this age of blatant commercialism. Understated is a good word to describe the hotel. The restoration and conversion to hotel space was respectful of the building's past, with many original features intact, yet with all the modern conveniences. We booked a junior suite and were upgraded upon check-in to a full suite: two large rooms on the top floor with views over the property's expansive and lovely gardens, and to the blue waters of the lagoon and the Lido beyond. Ceilings were 16 feet high with original heavy wood beams. Windows were tall and opened fully to flood the room with sea breezes, birdsong and light. Furnishings were classic and understated. The bed was large and comfortable, we slept better than at home. We had a plasma satellite TV that we never felt the urge to turn on. Excellent high speed wifi access, with a lower charge for our entire stay (not by the day, but the stay!) than we're accustomed to paying for a single night at hotels elsewhere. (The wifi signal also extended to the hotel's gardens, so my husband was able to carry on business in the mornings while we relaxed on lawn chairs in the shade of a flower-laden pergola.) Our suite also offered what was called a \"walk-in closet\" but what I would call a full dressing room, and a beautiful, huge marble bathroom with jacuzzi tub and separate good-sized shower with acceptable water pressure, double sinks with miles of marble counter. Soft, thick towels and bathrobes. Good hairdryer. My only (small) criticism is the make-up/shaving mirror should have been lit, as the bathroom lighting - small pinpoint spotlights in the ceiling high above - wasn't quite sufficient for 54-year-old eyes to confidently apply eye-liner and mascara. But moving to a dressing table near the window solved the problem. The staff at this hotel have been impeccably trained. To a person, they found and maintained that delicate, precarious balance of being genuine and friendly without becoming overly familiar, warm and yet still professional. Personal service that was always efficient, and completely unobtrusive. Never fawning. No snooty attitude, and no sense of pandering for tips. Absolutely seamless and wonderful. My congratulations to whomever trains them! We were greeted by name upon arrival (\"welcome, Mr. & Mrs. x\", thank god they didn't presume to use our first names), the early check-in we had requested was ready when we arrived a bit before noon, and we were given a brief tour of the property including elements of its history as we were led to our room. We requested a late check-out the evening before our departure, and were graciously permitted to keep our room until our transfer to the airport - at 3:15 pm. The breakfast was the typical European buffet of breads and pastries, jams, yogurts, fresh fruit and fruit juices, cold meats and cheeses, but also with scrambled eggs and Italian ham if you wanted something hot. Everthing was of a high quality. You could choose to eat in the pretty breakfast room with its lovely mural - but who would, when the terrace beckoned with views over the lush gardens, the scent of lavender and jasmine in the air? The breakfast staff were cheerful and quick to bring the excellent coffee with (or without) hot milk, or tea or hot chocolate if one preferred. We loved the extensive gardens, and in fact one day just stayed on Giudecca, tearing ourselves away from the beautiful grounds only for an hour or two's exploration of our unhurried, quiet island. We had one meal in the hotel restaurant, an excellent lunch on the gorgeous terrace. (if you like sashimi, be sure to try the tuna carpaccio salad) But we couldn't resist dinners at a small restaurant about 100 meters' walk from the hotel, where the tables were peopled mainly by locals. We went there on our first night, lured by the tables set at water's edge for the views of the setting sun and changing light on San Marco across the lagoon. We went back for the great food at reasonable prices (and more of those glorious views). Our 4 days/3 nights at the Bauer Palladio were all we'd hoped for and more. We've enjoyed years of extensive international travel (a dozen trips or more per year), both on business and for pleasure, so we have a solid basis for comparison.

The first room not what I expected, with one high, narrow window that afforded little view or light. But upon request was given a larger room with two windows giving onto magnificent views of the lagoon as well as views of this quiet, intimate neighborhood of mostly \"real\" Venetians. From this point on, everything about this hotel was low-key professionalism, effciency and courtesy (the staff was friendly and helpful in that unobtrusive way I prefer rather than the false, forced cheer that is imposed on guests in many American hotels, just to take an example). We stayed during the week, so that may have accounted for the unusual quiet and calm in the hotel and the surroundings, but I loved this serenity and leisure, especially when we had the beautiful, spacious garden all to ourselves in the afternoon. This is a beautiful property, possibly unique among hotels in Venice, and the rooms are nicely appointed, though I would've preferred a slightly more \"American\" touch (especially in terms of bedding and sheets) in certain areas (also chairs) that have a huge bearing on actual comfort while in the room. A couple of caveats. There is a solar-powered shuttle boat that ferries guests between the hotel and the main island, but it does not run from noon to about 5. But Giudecca is by no means isolated. We took the hotel shuttle only twice during our three nights/four days. Most of the time we got around much more efficiently on the vaporetto (the transit cards are sold in the little cafe/store right next to the hotel). Also, the hotel bar/restaurant doesn't serve full meals, but what they call \"snacks,\" light salad, sandwiches, etc. But there are a few restaurants right on the island of Giudecca if you want a decent meal, and of course you can always take the shuttle across the lagoon to dine in any one of Venice's many restaurants on the main island. But most of the time, after spending a day doing the tourist things on the main island, we were relieved and happy to be returning to Giudecca, a charming island of real Venetians living their daily lives (but it also seems increasingly destined soon to be a more tourist-oriented island as there are many signs of development). It already has the Bauer Palladio, the Cipriani and some Hilton behemoth on the far end of the island. I would prefer it stay the way it is.

The hotel is on the quayside on La Giudecca, literally opposite the mouth of the Grand Canal and San Marco. The airport is on the other side of Venice to the hotel, so our tip would be arrange for a water-taxi from Marco Polo Airport as it brings you through the middle of Venice along some of the canals, rather than the water bus which skirts around the city. This is admittedly an expensive option, but really worth it, especially if this is your first trip to Venice, as in our case. The hotel is in an ancient, monastery type building with fantastic period arches, passage ways and tiled floors. The view from our small but beautiful 2nr floor room we believe must be one of the best in Venice: looking out directly across the lagoon to the Grand Canal & San Marco. Unfortunately, it would seem that only a small number of rooms have this view and I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have been a little disappointed had our room faced another direction. I guess you could request this whilst booking. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be put off by the fact the hotel is not on the main Venice island \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hotel has a little boat which runs all day from outside the hotel to the sister hotel across the water (solar powered!) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the trip takes 5 minutes and we never had to wait more than 10 minutes for the boat. The hotel it connects with is in a very convenient location on the bank of the Grand Canal just 5 minutes walk to San Marco Square. This runs right the way through till late. There is also a Water-Bus stop 25m from the Palladio which takes you to lots of other locations around the city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the boats stop here every 5 minutes. We used the Spa at the hotel for a massage which was wonderful, however came with the usual hefty price tag - but nevertheless, a great way to spend a lazy Saturday morning. The only improvement I would make to the hotel is to address the lack of a decent bar. There is a bar / restaurant but this closes at 11pm and then it seemed to be at the discretion of the staff whether they would serve you after this in the lounge area. I would have thought that the hotel could justify putting something in place, especially as there isn't a great deal of bars within walking distance.

On first approach as we arrived, I was a bit thrown back as it didnt look like any hotel I'd stayed in, almost like a run down church (I was to learn later that it infact had been renovated from a derelict church). And the door you went through looked like the servicemans entrance rather than thr big church doors. But once inside I could not havw imagined it. There is a man employed to open the door for guests all day everyday, and despite the mind numbingly boring job, he remained very cheerful and pleasant. The reception staff are very friendly and very helpful, speak excellent english. We were shown to our room with out bags carried for us. They had two lifts to our floor, very quick, and sturdy. The room was exqusite, marble floors, a very spacious marble bathroom, walk in closet area, and the bedroom was huge! The bed could have easily fitted 3 people, very comfortable. There was a new LCD television, the only english channels being eurosport, BBC Sport and another sport channel but wasn't really on much. The room had high ceilings with wooden beams, and just had a wonderful peacefulness about it. We had views of the river and Venice, and when all lit up at night was so lovely. We stayed B&B, breakfast was served (i think) between 7:30 and 10:30 (dont quote me, may be wrong) The restaurant was very clean, staff were the friendliest and i didn't see anyone having a problem being seated. It had wonderful views of the garden. The staff were ever so friendly and also spoke very good english. They had a lounge area, which was beautiful, they had a massive fireplace which they would put on for you if you were sat there, even at midday. they would come and ask you if you would like any drinks, and brought them over to you. All the staff were wonderful, and would bend over backwards to make sure you had a good stay. We decided to dine in the restaurant one evening, in which we were seated at our usual breakfast table, with a guitarist playing easy listening music in the corner of the room. Our favourite waiter Tach served us, he was the friendliest man you could ever meet.

She led me to the spa which was through a door, down an outside corridor into another building (this was not a public passageway, was exclusive to the hotel) I was shown around, there was a shower and sauna to use if i wanted, then I changed into a lovely warm dressing gown and slippers and was shown to the \"relaxtion room\" and it definitely was relaxing. Dim lights, candles, herbal teas, huge sofa over looking a two way mirror, so you could see the lit up Venice, moon shining on the river (I had the massage about half 7pm). My masseuse came in, she was ever so friendly and told me what she would be doing, how the stones work, etc. the whole massage took about 1 hour 45 mins, and well worth every penny.

Before arrival I called to book the spa and it took over a minute for the hotel to answer. When we got there, the hotel was not what we expected. It's a converted convent which until last year was a conference centre. The entrance is anonymous, a small door next to the church. If it's glitz you're after, this hotel is not for you. The decor is a little austere, unlike, say, other converted religious buildings like the Villa San Michele, and there are still touches of conference centre if you look closely: the modern fire doors and fabric covering the walls of the lifts to hide the stainless steel beneath. The service, however, was great from the moment we arrived. We had booked a suite with canal view at Eu.650 +10%. We were shown to a suite with a garden view, and then to a smaller one with a tiny window overlooking the canal, so accepted the first which was huge and comfortable. There were small issues which will probably be resolved with time: the shower head broke, the sink plug wouldn't open and the bath had no water pressure (quickly fixed). Half of the room lights stopped working and my wife thought the room smelt of furniture varnish. The spa was small but welcoming and not busy. We didn't use the restaurant but room service breakfast was indifferent and expensive- Eu.75 in 'extras' for a half melon, scrambled eggs and 2 bowls of porridge is a bit much. There's a free shuttle boat to get you to town but beware it takes 10 minutes to arrive and another 10 to get you there, so staying here is not ideal if you want to spend a lot of time between the sights and your hotel. On the other hand, it's peaceful and the rooms are larger than in town. Also, compared to some other five star hotels like the Cipriani, the rates are keener. Our friends were spending Eu.3k a night for a suite there which they didn't rate at all. To sum up, the Palladio is OK but it lacks the wow factor I want for a five star romantic weekend away.

The rooms are a good size and well appointed. The candid pictures on the Trip Advisor site do not do the room justice. The rooms are elegant and have lots of character. The cathedral ceiling adds beauty and ambiance. The bathrooms are very well appointed and luxurious. They have all of the amenities that you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The only small knock against the hotel is location. This turns out to be a positive and negative. The negative is that you are a boat ride away from all of the Venice action. Sometimes you want to just wake up and get going with the sight seeing. However, the positive is that they offer a free shuttle that takes you back and forth to the main part of Venice. The shuttle is frequent and quick. The other positive is that you are away from all of the tourist which is sometimes a nice change of pace. In many ways you feel like you are on your own little island with a limited number of guests. Lastly, the service has been incredible. Everyone has gone out of their way to assist and make our stay wonderful. The staff understands and can speak English which is never an expectation but a pleasant surprise. I am confident that if you are seeking a romantic getaway with great staff and a little off of the normal beaten path, you will thoroughly enjoy the Bauer Palladio.", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris", "Title": "\u201cReally beautiful hotel but dreadful service\u201d", "Author": "Alain42", "ReviewID": "UR8672929", "Content": "Palladio Bauer really is a beautiful hotel and it would be quite unfair to complain about the amenities. It is also marvelously quiet and conveniently located on Guidecca island just opposite San Marco. But is really a 5 star luxury hotel ? The question makes sense as the service is just unacceptable. We had to wait 25 minutes on the day of our arrival to check in as the front desk is too small to take two guests at the same time and some clients made difficulties when checking out, so all we could do was wait during all that time. Don't expect a proper doorman as in any normal luxury hotel. There is either no doorman at the front door, or, if there is one, he may be busy doing something else than opening the door for you or... he may just stand behind the door but not mind open the door for you and just watch you push the door ! We often had to wait half an hour and even once, one full hour to have a shuttle boat between hotel Pallazo Bauer and hotel Palladio Bauer as there were many guests during the Mostra. However, when you are in Venice, there is so much to see that you do not intend to spend all your time on the quay of one of the two hotels... The concierge could have called a taxi boat, but did nothing, which really was very surprising. We were so disappointed by the poor quality of service that we had to write to the director of the hotel when we were back to France. All she could do was say that she wasn't there and that she was sorry !!! Is that luxury ??", "Date": "September 7, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bauer Palladio Hotel & Spa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d615183-Reviews-Bauer_Palladio_Hotel_Spa-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$397 - $792*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Giudecca 33</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30133</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "615183", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/98/4d/984d79a19d1ab1c674b4135e0c0953f810large.jpg"}}
