Compared to Globus Hotel in Florence, the room we got here was a little bigger, the toilet was big. But there was no safe for valuables unlike in Florence, we had to lock up our luggages even for just a walk around the neighborhood. The staff was helpful, but not very friendly. They did not serve ice for drinks, which in Florence was available 24/7, also hot water was sparse , here the concierge gave but was not too happy having to get up from his seat. Advantages of the hotel, it is near Roma Termini and the metro stations. Breakfast was spartan, coffee was watered down. Unlike in Florence someone was there to operate the big espresso machine for you, but here there was no one. However, when the employees reported for work, they went straight to the machine and made themselves cappuccino and espresso, including the chambermaid! To us patrons, we thought we had to pay extra for espresso or cappuccino, in Florence it was free and there was a barista who prepared it for you and served it to you during breakfast. I wish the staff were more hospitable, or are they all like that in all budget hotels in Rome? Another thing I could hear the traffic outside, and the people quarreling on the street maybe over parking space or a collision.

Now I definately can't knock the location, it was just a 5 minute walk to termini the main station that links you to a number of metro stations throughout Rome. Most of the time we found that we didn't need to travel via metro anyway as central rome is best enjoyed by walking everywhere which we pretty much did and within 2/3 days I would say we saw everything we wanted to see in and around the city. So the hotel was quiet accessible for walking around Rome to the main attractions which was nice but I was a little disappointed. From outside our hotel it looked Really nice and the main reception too definately looks as though it warrants the 3* status. However I was disappointed with our room. It was very small,old fashioned and although it looked clean it didn't feel that clean. Our bed was made every day but they didn't give us fresh towels. When I asked to use a travel adaptor the receptionist was very nice and helpful and they let us hold our bags there for the day when we checked out as our flight wasn't until the evening. Breakfast was ok, again a little disappointed as previous reviews had definately made it sound better than it was. Packet croissants, bruised fruit and watered down juice were on the menu but they did have nice whole grain rolls with cheese and ham if you like it continental. Overall was a nice hotel and was a good place to go if your on a budget. However next time I come to Rome I would like to pay a little more and stay somewhere a bit nicer. There are some great restaurants nearby as we found out during our last full day, so try out trattoria - mamma Angela's which was lovely for authentic reasonably priced food", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "Dotcouple", "ReviewID": "UR125133745", "Content": "The front desk staff were friendly and helpful.

Since this is low season, the price was perfect. The hotel is situated 2 minutes from Termini Station, on a quiet road. The staff were very polite, helpful and speak good english. Room was on the second floor, overlooking the road. Pretty quiet. Very clean. Not big, but it was big enough for two people. The bathroom was small, especially the shower cubicle. I'm not sure if that would be pleasant for a big person. Towels were changed daily. They also provide you with soap, shower gel/shampoo, and shower caps. My only complaint here is that the water was not very hot, but I'm used to steaming hot water, so maybe it's a matter of preference. It was warm enough though. TV has a couple of satellite channels if you want to watch english-speaking tv. The breakfast was perfect. You could choose from many different things, cakes, croissants, bread, butter, honey, many flavors of marmelade, cheese, ham, salami, fruit, milk, coffee, tea, juice. The orange juice was the only thing I didn't like, it was more like water with sugar and a bit of orange color and flavor. But the rest was pretty tasty and good enough to start a day of sightseeing in Rome. There was free wifi that worked in our room too. There were also two computers in the lobby with printing facilities. I don't know if those are for free, but we used one computer to check in online for our flight and we also printed the boarding passes, and noone asked us for money, so, I guess it must be free. If you arrive earlier than the time specified for check-in, or have a lot of time between check-out and departing from Rome, you can leave your luggage at the hotel and spend those hours in Rome without having to worry about dragging your suitcase with you all day.

It's less than a five minute walk to Termini station, making it easy to get around. There's a Hop On, Hop Off tour bus and an airport shuttle literally right at the end of the street. The location itself is OK, but there's nothing too interesting to do in the immediate area. However, if you're a vegetarian, vegan or just enjoy healthy food, The Beehive hostel right down the block has a very small restaurant that serves daily breakfast, weekend brunch and snacks the rest of the time (no lunch or dinner, unfortunately). One morning I got tofu scramble with veggies, homemade bread and jam, a large soy cappuccino and water, all for 9 euros. The Piemonte offers an included breakfast, which I'll talk about in a sec. They also have free wi-fi in the rooms or there's a computer to use in the lobby. And they will loan you plug converters and umbrellas. Despite what other people said, I found the staff to be pretty helpful and fluent in English. Now the cons: While the room seemed clean on the surface, we had an ant problem in our bathroom (room 220). At least they weren't bed bugs, I guess. The room was small, yes, but not too bad. I mean, how much time are you really spending in there anyway? They originally tried to give us a room in a building down the block, but we refused because it meant we had to walk outside to get to the breakfast room and front desk, etc. We investigated the other building at one point, and it seemed kinda sketchy with a dirty lobby, a rickety 1800s-era elevator and a wide open door with seemingly no security. If anyone has ever stayed here, I'd be curious to know what the actual rooms were like. Anyway...the other negatives were the fact that you could hear everything going on in the hallway - mainly the cleaning people, who started their duties every day around 8 a.m. and didn't seem to finish till 1 p.m. I'm not sure what took so long. And while breakfast is included, we were pretty over it by the third or fourth day. It's basically just bread/pastry, meat/cheese, whole fruits and cereal. Nothing's cooked and there's no toaster for the bread. Also, the beds are hard, the pillows are weird and the towels are like sandpaper.

I had set my expectations minimal while travelling to Rome, hence was not disappointed. Hotel is about 200-300 meters away from the Roma Termini station,which is a positive point. The bus station as well is about 300 meters away, and you can always take the public transport to move around in the city. Hence, accessbility wise, it was good. We checked into the hotel in the afternoon. The gentleman at the reception was welcoming, and spoke in decent english. He checked us in within 5 minutes, and room keys were handed over. The elevator works fine, so no worries about carrying the luggage upstairs. Room was decent enough in size. I mean, for a couple the room size was sufficient. I could open the blinds and windows to let the sunlight in. The only thing i did not like about the room was the wash room. The cubicle for taking shower is quite small and you might actually feel claustrophobic! Breakfast was very basic, There was only one lady working in the breakfast room. She was setting up the table, cleaning, washing, re-filling the food. I thought it was too much for one person to take. Moreover, the way dishes were being thrown around, we got a feeling that she doesn't like people sitting in the breakfast room and dirtying her dishes. But we later realised in other restaurants that this is a norm in Rome. Dishes are usually thrown around which to us was very irritable! There are couple of restaurants within Via Vicenza which offer good food, and excellent service. If you come out of Piemonte hotel, and take a left, avoid the restaurants on the main road! The service was so pathetic that sitting for 15 minutes, we and all other people there did not even receive the menu / their order.

Before we booked the hotel for a three night stay with our family of four (a three year old and a one year old), we were confused by the conflicting reviews about the sizes of rooms. I contacted the hotel to ask whether we could all fit, and the lovely Roberto promised that there would be enough room for all of us. We arrived very early in the day, about 8:30 after an overnight flight from Hong Kong and asked if we could check in early. Again, the staff were friendly and direct - yes, they could check us in early at no cost, but we may not get the big room we need. So we waited until about 11, and got a fantastic room. This room had been extended at the back so essentially there was a second room added on, with a single bed, wardrobe and desk with TV. We were also given a great portable cot for the baby at no extra cost (a good quality brand, and it seemed hardly used). If it had not been for the extension we would not have fit in.... but with this, we had plenty of space for us and our luggage. OK, the bathroom (and the shower cubicle especially) was a tight fit, but I have been in smaller other European countries. The breakfast was basic but sufficient, and the staff kept smiling while our mini-monsters threw yoghurt and crumbs all over the floor. On the last night there, my three year old got sun stroke - the staff provided clean sheets for her and even lent us a thermometer - I really wonder what else they may have been hiding behind the front desk if I had asked for it! There is a good sized supermarket about two blocks away, and we did most of our supply shopping there. We drank only one bottle of water from the minibar (which, at 1 Euro, was not cheap but not any more expensive than would be charged around the main attractions in Rome) and when we went to pay for it at checking out, they told us not to worry about it! Overall, we discovered that Rome in the summer time was not the best stopover choice with little kids, but the hotel made it as bearable and pleasant as it could. The only thing was the aircon was not strong enough to cope with the heat. PS - we did see a couple of weirdos around the Termini, but did not feel threatened at any time.

Being very close to the Termini didn't bother us, it was very convenient, yes there were some tramps around but they were docile and didn't pester us at all. We used the metro only on one day and my husband had over 200 euros stolen from a zipped pocket in his trousers within 20 seconds of getting on the VERY packed metro. Not a very pleasant experience. Second time we used the metro we witnessed another pickpocket in action - this time a very small boy (around 7yrs old) had taken a wallet from French tourist's bumbag, which was underneath his poloshirt at his front!! In future I would rather walk. Lots of lovely restaurants can be found near this hotel - locals and tourists alike use the Nazarreno (I think that's what it's called) - fabulous food, excellent service and quite reasonable. Il Trimani wine bar is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel is excellent too - the wine menu is almost an inch thick and prices for a bottle varied from around 10 euros to many many euros!!

The location is great if you are arriving to Rome by train as we did, and if you will be using the metro or buses. Unfortunately for Hotel Piemonte, their close proximity to Termini equals noise. Even at five blocks away, the moped, car and tourist traffic next to this corner hotel equals a lot of night time noise, just when you are trying to sleep away your aches and pains. Also, there is major construction going on about 500 yards away from the hotel and jackhammers started around 7 AM (great alarm, I guess). The beds were HORRIBLE, even compared to the other crappy twin beds I slept in in Venice, Florence and Siena, these beds are so HARD that I would liken it to sleeping on the floor, that's how hard they are. The maids never changed the sheets during our six night stay, either. The bathroom as I'm sure you can expect was not roomy. I had trouble getting into the corner shower, and the commode was so close to the sink that I leaned to the left every time I sat down to pee. The hair dryer was like a vacuum cleaner and didn't dry hair, so bring your own (but you can't plug it in in the bathroom, so you'll dry your hair sitting on your bed). The breakfast was average, but the \"rich variety of salumi and cheeses\" was pressed deli ham and some provolone. I went with the brioche and yogurt, which is a lot better than U.S. yogurt. They don't ask you if you'd like some, but they do offer cappochino or espresso free of charge (we found out on our fourth day, thanks). Service at the counter was pert but polite, but the older gentleman at night, which some described as charming, was kind of nutty. Nice and helpful though, and gives you these little slips of paper with directions to attractions and what bus to take. Finally, a word to all my American friends looking for a hotel with air conditioning: THIS AIN'T IT. The temp was in the mid 80s F when we were there and asked about the air. The reply was, \"we haven't turned it on yet,\" though they advertise it on their website. If you are using this review as a gauge as to where to book in Rome, let me tell you this: this place, with all its crappy quirks, is average. I've stayed in worse places in Rome. The location is good if you can get around the street vendors and beggars loitering around Termini all day and night. If you want some place quiet, I suggest the Aventine Hill. I paid 150 euro a night for this mediocre hotel, and I know I could've done a lot worse. Roman hotels and hospitality is very different and can be shocking compared to American standards, so be prepared to either suck it up or paid more.", "Date": "June 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jacko062", "ReviewID": "UR4309380", "Content": "Hotel Piemonte has a very good location, its near the Termini station where you can take the metro and the national trains to any place in Italy.

Exit the hotel, take the first right and across the square is the supermarket and a couple of restaurants. Rome is very expensive (\u20ac4-5 for a diet coke in some places) and the restaurants are not too good and expensive so the supermarket was brilliant. Roberto was the man on the desk, very polite, friendly and answered all our questions. We were there for 5 nights. The hotel was immaculate and although the rooms are small they offer everything you need plus a hairdryer. The lounge was very comfy with leather sofas, a chair (3) and 2 computers for the internet. There appears to be ramps for wheelchair users and a downstairs toilet big enough to take a wheelchair plus a lift. Breakfast was continental but had everything to fill you up. The milk was not sour on any of the days we stayed (5 of them) and the choices were yoghurts, rolls, ham, cheese, pastries, cornflakes, muesli and jams etc. Tea, coffee and herbal teas. Not bad for a basic breakfast. There was even a bar in the dining area for anybody wanting a drink in the evening.
