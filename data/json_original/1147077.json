Arriving at 6am in the morning after a very long flight from Australia, the hotel staff and reception were incredibly warm and accommodating, having our room ready (room 707) and arranging for us to have buffet breakfast on the day of our arrival instead of the day of our departure, since our departing flight required us to leave early in the morning for Athens. All the staff is very attentive but never is anyone on top of you. The hotel exudes a quiet charm and elegance - it is as if it is a sanctuary amidst the hussle and bustle of Istanbul. ROOMS We booked the most basic twin room for 3 ppl and we were treated like KIngs and Queens. The hotel itself is very new (only 3 yrs old) and the rooms are very spacious. I had the best roll-away bed out of my whole EU trip here, whilst my parents' bed was incredily comfortable and very large - they couldn't touch each other! The view is of Galata Tower and the street the hotel faces (Bronz Sokak or Nisantasi, both views are stunning). The nespresso machien was a bonus and so easy, whilst the bathroom is very well designed and has heated tiling, separate wash basin area, separate toilet and separate bath and shower. In fact, the shower had a hammam inside - it was definitely the best shower I have ever experienced in my whole life and you truly feel clean, destressed and relaxed after having a hammam shower. Of course, you don't have to have the hammam on if you wish to have a shower! BREAKFAST I prefer a smaller range at buffet breakfasts with quality and fresh produce and an a la carte menu to choose hot food - and this is exactly what the Park Hyatt serves and I believe they've hit the jackpot here! Their cheese pie and koulouria (round bread) was to die for and their entire delicatessen section was updated daily and beautiful. The waiters were very professional, cooking us a range of hot food every day from Eggs Florentine to Omelettes, French Toast and Eggs with Chorizo sausage, etc. Their cappuccinos are amazing and so are the hot chocolates. THE PRIME RESTAURANT We celebrated our last night after an exhilirating and dream-like trip in Istanbul at the hotel's restaurant, The Prime. It had been my birthday and the hotel was kind enough to allow my father to bring a very special and expensive bottle of Sth African wine we had been given by a special American family friend of ours. I was glad to see that all the staff at the Park Hyatt, especially at the Prime, espoused a level of finesse we lack greatly in Australia and in the US. The steaks and seafood are cooked in front of you - it is an open air kitchen - and I can tell you it was good value! We were looked after very well and we were even surprised by a special Birthday Cake the hotel had arranged for me, with all the staff and my family singing \"happy birthday\" - a brilliant touch. LOCATION Istanbul is too large of a city to walk everywhere. We did LOTS of walking in Istanbul adn wore the soles out of our shoes, but I can assure you there is no one place where all the tourist & historic sites are! The hotel is perfectly situated in a very safe, busy and upmarket area called Nisantasi - we think it is the best area to stay in because you have everything at your doorstep. I have never seen designer stores as plentiful in number and as busy in nature as the ones here near the hotel, in Istanbul! Streets are so clean and picture perfect, everyone will love them, and designer shopping is cheap compared to what we pay in EU and especially compared to Australia! An added bonus is that taxis are quite cheap in Istanbul and plentiful in number. Many thanks to the hotel for the concierge's TOP recommendations for dinner on 3 nights in a row - remember to try out the restaurant right opposite the hotel for a true Turkish cuisine experience with a classy twist. Not expensive at all! We hope to come back to Istanbul as soon as possible and we are truly indebted to the hotel for making our holiday so magical and for helping us forge such an affinity with the beautiful city of cultural, historical and religious wealth that is Istanbul!", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "BeliNY", "ReviewID": "UR122438774", "Content": "It is a wonderful hotel.

The buffet was a smorgasbord of offerings that included fresh and dried fruits, cold cuts, olives, fresh-baked pastries, cheeses, honeys, and yogurts. On top of that, we were offered a hot entree that ranged from pancakes to tasty omelets. Even if you don't have breakfast here, stop in for the great coffee - probably one of the best cups of coffee we've had anywhere. Another great thing about the hotel is Ali who worked the front desk. He's very knowledge and well-traveled, yet very down to earth and approachable. He gave us a tour of our room upon arrival, occasionally checked in on us, and spent an hour telling us about all the different parts of Turkey before we headed off. Ali was great and made our stay stand-out! (Also, the concierge was most helpful and patient, but I can't remember her name.) The downside is that the Park Hyatt is fairly far from the main sites. We walked once from the Blue Mosque back, and being fit, late 20-something folks, it was still quite a trek. The upside is that you'll get to see a different part of town. The immediate area is pretty swanky with lots of international retail and little restaurants (some of which are terrible tourist traps.)

Never have I felt so much at home in an hotel so quickly. Despite our early 8am arrival we were warmly greeted by name and with the minimum of formalities escorted to our beautifully appointed spa room by the charming receptionist Doruk. Spa rooms are spacious, beautifully appointed, have ample storage, versatile lighting, beautiful linens and come with all modern day expectations. Those on the 6th floor (as opposed to the 7th) have the advantage of Romeo and Juliette balconies which give even better views of the Bosphorus. Of course their piece de resistance is the bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c probably the size of a large bedroom in Sultanamet, they offer a separate WC, wash basin area (with a dedicated drinking water basin) and huge \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwet room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which contains a large bath, steam room and haman facility complete with pestemals (fringed towels) tas (metal bowl) and kese (scrubbing cloth) together with some wonderfully aromatic Isparta rose soap and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lighting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in addition to a television screen! Bathroom toiletries are from Blaise Mautin in an intoxicating perfume made especially for this Park Hyatt and which pervades the whole hotel. Public areas include a spacious lobby area which incorporates a lounge serving delicious breakfasts (and all day dining) in addition to a delightful bar area featuring a good selection of wines. There is also a separate formal restaurant (Prime) and open-air terrace with outdoor pool, small spa and 24 hour gym. However, surpassing all this luxuriousness, are the staff who really make this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 somewhere special. From the suave and knowledgeable Guest Services Manager, Anthony and the ever present Front Office Manager, Kevin to breakfast supervisor Caner and bar attendant Merve, the various concierges, door staff and others, guests are treated with warmth and individuality, often and frequently being addressed by name \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is hotelkeeping of the highest order and those who appreciate such attributes will surely enjoy this hotel. Personally, even as a first time visitor to Istanbul, I loved the location, surrounded by stylish shops, cafes and restaurants, yet within an easy downhill stroll to Kabatas and the tramway which will take one to Sultanamet; or a ride on the teleferic cable car and onward to Taksim.

The hotel was wonderful. It's in an old 1920's building which has been beautifully restored and the understated location in a small side street is fantastic although be aware that most taxi drivers go to the other Hyatt so make sure you have a small map with you! Some reviews have commented on the hotel being 15-20 minutes from the main sights but it's actually much nicer not to stay in the tourist area. Not only were there loads of shops - everything from Gucci to M&S - but there were tons of amazing restaurants and cafe's within a 5 minute walk. We were upgraded to one of the larger rooms on the 6th floor with a partial view of the Bosphorous. The room was extremely comfortable with a huge bed, large flat screen tv and fresh fruit which was replenished every day. There was also an enormous bathroom with it's own tv, steam room, separate basin with drinking water, heated floor and coloured mood lighting. All the staff at the hotel, without exception, were genuinely wonderful. They were helpful and friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble. I would say that the internet cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18/day and that drinks were very expensive but that seems to be par for the course in Istanbul generally.

Just relaxed, took long showers, enjoyed the private steam room that was in the bathroom. The service was impeccable as always with Park Hyatt. Upon check in I was escorted all the way up to my room, introduced to the features of the room, etc. They have DVD's available for rent at the Concierge desk that was nice to have. My one complaint. You go to a hotel to sleep...but unfortunately (and no fault of the hotel), there is a night club that had music pumping very loudly until about 3 a.m. This was a Saturday night. I pretty much was unable to sleep that night. If you ask to be put on the street side you probably won't have this problem, or if you are there during the weekdays.
