For the price per night (something like \u20ac40) this hotel is fab. Round the corner from the station and metro - sightseeing buses all stop at Termini so excellent if you are planning on being a total toursit like we were :) Walking distance to the Colosseum / Forum and a couple of nice restaraunts nearby; Giuseppes round the corner was the nicest. There's also a place called Tudini's nearby where they make a fab cocktail but the food was pretty average and quite expensive - lovely staff though including Tudini himself... they also have free wi-fi at both Guiseppe's and Tudini's so we went there to use the internet if needed as it's not available in the hotel. The local area is slightly 'Kings Cross' at night - if you are a city dweller then you're unlikely to be worried...but there are a fair few homeless people / odd charachters around after dark. We always felt quite safe though but wouldn't carry alot of cash etc as there are dodgy groups hanging around the station. We didn't have any trouble at all though so dont be put off. There's not a great deal to do of an evening but apparently this applies to Rome as a whole not just the Termini area. If you are sightseeing all day then you will probably be glad to have an excuse to have an earlyish night and a rest :D Hotel is nice enough, fab for the price. Breakfast was ok - just croissants and stuff but enough to fill you up til lunch. Staff were always really friendly. Rooms are cleaned and well equipped, not luxury but were certainly better than I expected for the price.

The hotel welcomes you with a clean, modern lobby and friendly service staff. We booked a double room. The room was very clean and well decorated. We had cable TV and one of the best showers I'd experienced on my travels. The best part was that the area was very quiet at night as the hotel is situated on a nice, well lit plaza.

The reception staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. Breakfast was simple, a choice of 3 cereals, bread rolls, croissants, 2 fruit juices, jams, honey etc tea and coffee.

We chose it initally because it was the first one we found on the internet that was near Termini and under 150 euros a night. The cost was 120 per night and they were most accomodating to our situation. They happily kept our bags for us while we ran from train station to airport, trying to find transportation to France, as we kept having to check out and back in, but they found us rooms when it happened, though we did have to move twice. Mr. Mariano, the owner, was very nice and worked with us, even making calls to the airlines and translating the recorded messages regarding flights for us. The alos allowed us to use the hotel internet twice to transer money from our accounts, as we were leary of using the internet points to access our funds. He also recommended restaurants and made note of places we went to eat that we liked, presumably to recomend to others. Perhaps most importantly, at a time when other hotels were increasing their prices to take advantage of the stranded travelers, he not only did NOT do so, he condemed those business practices to us, stating he only raises prices during Christmas and Holy Week, even though he could do so other times, but that he felt it was just wrong. We couldn't have asked for a more pleasant, honest and helpful person. The rooms were all quite nice, not luxurious, but cozy. They were large and had windows overlooking the old aquarium building. While it was very close to Termini, it was also very quiet with the windows shut and we never heard street noise at night. Two of the rooms we had would have slept 4 easily, with two twins made into a king and another twin bed with a trundle underneath. The maids came daily and cleaned. The only complaint I would have is the hot water was very touchy and would go from boiling hot to barely warm without warning. Breakfast was included, served from 7 to 10 a.m. It was very basic, juice, coffee, tea, cereal, rolls and croissants. The Termini station area is not my favorite, but we never felt unsafe wandering around day or night. Some very good restaurants were nearby and cheap places for sandwiches as well. The area has a large ethnic population, with many middle-eastern and asian eateries and stores. This is not a hotel with lots of ammenities, no fitness center, no internet, no pool, no room service.

We couldn't eat breakfast due to how dirty we found the hotel and the food was stale and both of the 2 options were inedible to us. After 3 star hotels in France, England, Greece and Spain, this hotel was nothing more than a backpacker hotel, and backpackers were the only other guests I saw stay here. The TV we had had no reception on the one English speaking channel. There was no little fridge (very difficult in such a hot place) and the safes in our room did not work, which was a concern considering the area the hotel is in.

It's also on the south side of termini, relatively close to the otherwise very inconvenient track from which the train to the airport (the Leonardo Express) departs. Bad things: the breakfast (more below), no internet access at any price, minimal amenities. The room, booked as a double on booking.com, turned out to be a triple with a fourth folding bed conveniently at hand. The room had fabric-covered walls and tile floors. Amenities were minimal: there was no Kleenex, nevermind a kettle or coffee maker. The mattresses had little toggles (much like a futon), but they could only be felt on the half of the mattress not covered by the mattress pad. Pillows were flat, and the bedspread reminded me of the cheap polyester things seen in cheap US hotels. Despite this uninspired bedding, I slept very well. The room had a small safe. Rooms used chip-card keys which they asked to have left at reception when going out (= no real security for the room). Breakfast included croissants, rolls, two varieties of (packaged, not fresh) juice, and cereal. The milk was reconstituted from powder, and there were no cheeses, cold cuts, eggs, or other protein. The spreads included an off-brand Nutella substitute. Summary: I'd happily stay here again if I were taking the Leonardo Express train, but, given the breakfast and lack of net, I wouldn't choose it for more than a one night stay.

The porter, Giovanni, was very helpful, booking a nearby restaurant for us when we arrived late on the first night due to flight delays & even arranging for a musician to play for us there because he'd noticed on my passport it was my birthday. HOWEVER, please note that taxis from Ciampino Airport to anywhere in central Rome are a fixed 30 EURO rate & the same on the way back. Giovanni tried quite hard to persuade us to book 3 taxis back to the airport at a cost of 40 EURO or more each & didn't seem to have heard of the fixed rate. When I was politely insistent, he phoned the taxi company & agreed, with surprise, that it was just 30 EURO. We also confirmed the rate with each driver before getting in the taxi & had no problems. Generally speaking, try to have an idea of what your taxi will cost, check the meter is on & watch it throughout the journey. We got 2 taxis to the same destination & one group was charged twice what the other one was.", "Date": "November 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walsall, Midlands", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for......\u201d", "Author": "josephine28", "ReviewID": "UR10565791", "Content": "I went direct to the hotel to book, which was cheaper than going via one of the hotel booking websites.

It is literally a 5 minute walk from the station so it's really handy. The breakfast is basic, (bread and jam and some cereal), but perfect for getting something in you before you start walking. I wouldn't go on the bus tour - it takes you round all the main sites and costs about 19 euros. For 4 euro's you can buy a ticket from the train station which lets you go on all public transport until 12 at night. Much better on the pocket.

The room itself was larger than we had anticipated and was easily large enough for both my wife and I. The close proximately to the train/metro station made it easy to get to different points in the city. What we weren't very impressed with was the area around the hotel. I will say we never felt threatened or even unsafe, but this isn't the normal tourist area that you would expect a hotel to be in. To put it in perspective imagine any large city and the area around a train station or subway station. It is dirty and not generally the most desirable area to be in. It only takes a block, in the right direction, to get to a main street that is more touristy and leads to Santa Maria Majorie. Overall, we were content with this hotel.
