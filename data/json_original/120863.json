I'd definitely recommend the historic warehouse building - stayed there a few years ago and was impressed.

If the logos were absent, you wouldn't know it was a Hampton Inn. This chain normally has clean, comfortable, functional, but simple properties. This particular property is much more substantial in its services and decor. This renovated warehouse offers an interesting change from cookie-cutter hotels. They did a great job modernizing it without destroying its original look. The large, high ceilinged lobby is a nice place to sit and read or meet friends. Also, there wasn't obnoxiously loud music blasting, making it peaceful and relaxing. Pros: Friendly staff. Spacious and clean room, with high ceilings. Our requested rollaway waiting for us in the room. A huge breakfast area with many tables (often a problem at other hotels). A better-than-average breakfast buffet that was constantly refreshed. An on-site bar. Plentiful cabs (we didn't have a car). Nice neighborhood; despite its neat but somewhat gritty appearance, there are lots of little nooks and crannies to explore. A shower with ample water pressure and hot water, which can be problematic at older hotels in New Orleans. Upon check-in, we had to initial on the contract that we would comply with their no-smoking rules, which I appreciated, being allergic to smoke. Cons: Very few...I was surprised that since the hotel had a nice lounge, and offered in-house catering for events, they would have food service available for guests but they didn't. There were bar-and-grill places nearby for a simple meal, but were really smoky. We had a partial kitchen, (no stove or kitchen sink, but a counter, microwave, fridge and basic eating utensils), which was handy, but a serrated knife would be helpful. We had bought fruit and cheeses and found it hard to assemble a platter using what was basically a butter knife. Lastly, either there were guests who disregarded the smoking rules, or the ventilation system had issues, but several times the smell of stale smoke was in the room. If it was a guest belligerence problem, I guess the hotel can't do much about that.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portage,IN", "Title": "\u201cFinal Four Stay\u201d", "Author": "zebra6331", "ReviewID": "UR127746463", "Content": "First of all, you must request the old building...very cool and unique.

We got more help from the desk staff. We had intended to tour as well as attend our convention. There were always taxis available. The location was the best for the convention center but far from the fun. The Convention Center was right across the street and for that reason, I would return to this hotel. There was nowhere to eat in the hotel except for microwavable and junk food. The major reason I gave this an average is that the carpet in our room was damp. The entire room was damp, actually. I hand washed a shirt that I wanted to rewear. It was a travel shirt that was supposed to dry quickly and has in the past. It took four days to dry. Now, I understand that NOLA is humid.

While the room was clean (we had 2 double beds), the mattress on the beds was too soft and one of them kept sliding off the box spring. While the bathroom was average size, the towels were dingy and very thin. The carpet did appear to be clean and the room did not have an odor They did offer the free breakfast and I'm torn on how to review it. I've stayed at the other Hampton Inn in New Orleans and the breakfast there was much better. While this Hampton had the waffle makers, the layout of the food was awful. The food was up against one wall, in a single line, with the waffle makers at the end of the line. It got really congested. The food on the bar was not that great either. The \"omelets\" were the pre-packaged kind and the sausages were greasy. The waffle was good though! Overall, I would not stay at this Hampton Inn again.

So uncomfortable we couldn't stand it so no drinks and headed to our room and the whole hotel was cold.

There was a pole exactly in front of both the bed AND sitting area and it would have been a great place to mount the flat screen tv. The bathroom was well equipped and was clean. There was a pretty good frayed area of the carpeting where the carpet meets the bathroom tile that needed taking care of.

Once arriving back at the terminal after the cruise we called to have the shuttle pick us up and return us to the hotel to pick up our car.

Upon arriving, there was one person working check-in/service desk and I witnessed him being rude, curt/short, and dismissive with three different guests--1 wanted to know whereabouts of 'the cookies', another asked about food that was supposed to be out, a third had room-key issues. One of the guest mumbled to me that she knew he would do something like that and how hateful that little man is'. I turned to leave then thought better of it and proceeded to desk. The desk personnel ignored me initially until about my third 'excuse me, please'. Then he almost snapped with response. I told him about telephone conversation and instructions from charlene(?). He flat out told me there was no way anyone told me that because the rate was unbelievable and the rooms go for much higher. Taken aback, asked him if he was calling me a liar. He repeated himself. I sternly told him don't call me a liar. He began going on about the hotel being 90% sold out, and that the rooms go for much higher than what's on flyer card. I told him I don't need toknow all that--that has nothing to do with the reason I was there and that he was rude and nasty and that I'd driven over 600 miles to visit the city and showing up at his check in desk to tell a lie wasn't the reason for the visit. I told him he had some nerve calling me a liar when I'm a potential guest and he doesn't know me and that was very poor customer service, he was very unprofessional and rude. He backed all the way down at that point and even said he was sure 'she' quoted me that price but that 'she' should not have. Just saying there was no longer any availability for that promotional would have suffice. Yet, he took the opportunity--and from what I witnessed as I stood waiting my turn, every opportunity--to be rude, nasty, and unnecessary. As the passer-by guest said, hateful, and I'll add to that, condescending. If he didn't have a room in that price range, he should have just stated that. However, it boiled down to not only did he not want to honor the flyer-card, he didn't want anyone else to honor it either. I would have totally understood if I'd been told the room rate was no longer available. Because I was so hot and tired, I'd planned to check in at any rate. Needless to say, after giving him a quiet piece of my mind, we left and found very fine lodging and great customer service at neighboring superior property. I guess one gets what one pays for, because that Hampton Inns & Suites Convention Center New Orleans 'desk clerk' demeanor, behavior, and customer NO-service mannerism was low-rated cheap.

The hotel is a retrofit of an old cotton factory and you can tell they tried very hard to keep as much original structure as possible. The lobby has high ceilings, exposed brick walls and exposed beams. Off the main registration area, you'll find a very spacious breakfast/seating/TV room, as well as a bar / lounge and the concierge desk. The lobby has two separate exits into the coutyard pool area, which is very quaint and comfortable, with 4 or 5 tables and a few loungers. We stayed in a jr. suite on the 5th floor above the lobby (there is a different building with rooms as well that looks like a newer structure, so I can't speak to the rooms there). Our room was enormous. We had a corner room that was, in the most descriptive word possible, long. Walked in to a small foyer, with a nearly full kitchen (microwave, stovetop, dishwasher, cofee pot and refrigerator) as well as a breakfast bar with chairs and a cabinet full of table settings and cookware. A living room was off the kitchen, which has a gorgeous 42 or 47\" LG flat screen TV, and a large, comfortable sofa and chair. Down the hallway was a large vanity area with actual pull out drawers and under-the-sink storage (awesome for a girl and her beauty gear!), and a separate bathroom for the toilet and shower. Our particular suite was 2 beds, and my only teeny tiny gripe was these are definitely doubles / full size beds, not queens. Since I was traveling with my guy, it was a tight squeeze in a double. Maybe im just spoiled with my king at home and usual choice of a king in my hotel rooms. The bedroom area also had a large work desk, huge, vaulted ceilings and an armoire with another large LG flat screen television. In terms of getting around, we paid $20/person each way to get to/from MSY on an airport shuttle (look for the people in the yellow shirts at the airport), and they got us to and from MSY in less than 30 minutes. Since we didn't have a car, we did not have to pay the parking fee, so I guess we saved a ton there. We mostly walked into and back from the French Quarter, and it is a bit of a walk, about 15 minutes or so. But the weather was gorgeous while we were there and the walk was comfortable and interesting. On the few occasions we took a cab into the Quarter, we paid about $7.

The first two points were annoying but the third point made me mad. I asked the concierge if there was a cemetery accessible by trolley. He politely pulled out a map and went through the route with me. Armed with my map, I and my extended family, including pre-teens, set off. After some time walking and dealing with crowded trolleys, we arrived at the LaFayette cemetery only to find that it was closed on Sundays--all day Sunday. it's not like we missed the open hours; they were not open at all that day and the concierge, whose job it is to help tourist with these things, should have known and should have told me. That aside, my experience was very good. The room itself was comfortable enough. And although there was a constant line at the front desk, the front desk staff was always friendly. The hotel lobby is unique with its old brick walls. In the lobby the staff provides much needed chilled water and has many comfortable sitting arrangements. The breakfast provided at the hotel was great: waffles, cereal, yogurt, fruit. Coffee is provided all day. The hotel location was very convenient. Right across the street from a grassy park and just walking minutes away from the Riverwalk, Starbucks, and great restaurants (like Mulates). It's also about a 30 minute walk to the French Quarter and about a 20 minute walk to the St. Charles Street trolley stop or Harrah's casino. Being directly across the street from the Convention Center, the immediate area was filled with convention goers on weekdays and relatively empty during the weekend.

The advantage of staying here, rather than in the French Quarter, is that the area around the hotel is much quieter than the Quarter is, so we did not have our sleep disturbed by drunken revelry outside the hotel. This hotel is only about a fifteen minute walk from the Quarter, so we were easily able to walk to the Quarter to see the Mardi Gras parades, or eat dinner.

Overall, the hotel was nice and clean, the people at the front desk were really nice and helpful too. The location is bad if you want to do any sightseeing. It's too far to walk to Bourbon Street and any other attraction, you will spend a lot of money on cabs. But I was there for a conference and it's a great location for that. All I had to do was walk across the street. I switched hotels for the weekend so I could be closer to the attractions, I would recommend doing that if you want to enjoy New Orleans at night. Also, there are no hotel shuttles anywhere, so when I needed a cab to get to my other hotel, they charged us a flat fee of $10, I think that's what it was, even though it would have been cheaper if I had them drop me off at the restaurant next door, then it would have only cost $5.

It is a bit of a walk from the French quarter, probably about 15-20 minutes. It is great if you plan to spend most of your time at your meeting, otherwise I'd choose another location. Nearby are a few up and coming and established restaurants, but there isn't the density of Canal Street and the French Quarter. The hotel is in an old Cotton mill, historic brick building on the outside. The lobby and common areas are clean, appropriate for the hotel quality, not overwhelming or overly impressive. The staff was helpful - brought an extra toothbrush on request, helped out with running route suggestions, explained how to use the streetcars, and arranged a tax for 4:30 in the morning - they did a nice job. The room was standard Hampton Inn. CRTV, no flat-screen. No safe in the room. Standard HI bathroom, perfectly serviceable, clean and white, nothing objectionable at all. The beds (we had a 2 double bed room) were very comfortable, and clean. The room was quiet to noise from the outside. Our only complaint, and it is a significant one, is that the climate control system was poor. During the hot and humid weather we had (isn't it always hot and humid in New Orleans?), the room was constantly muggy, no matter how high we cranked up the AC. It wasn't hot in the room - the AC made it downright cold. It's just that there was constant humidity in the room. At night, even though I was cool/cold, I found myself sweating under the sheets because of the humidity. Also, the AC unit was extremely noisy. With the unit off, the TV was easily heard on volume 10. With the unit on, the TV could not be heard until the volume was at 35-40 or higher. Since it is New Orleans, and always hot, the room was noisy almost continuously. The breakfast was standard Hampton Inn - hardboiled eggs, an omelet choice, a potato choice, fresh waffles, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, juice. It's a pretty nice breakfast, though not fancy. I thought the price was about right - not a steal - for the quality of the hotel. Again, the location is plus/minus - close to the conference, but definitely farther from the 'action' and most of the restaurants. The walk really isn't bad, though, and you are closer to the St. Charles Ave streetcar from this hotel than if you stayed nearer the French Quarter. Overall we'd stay here again, but only if we could be assured of either a quieter AC or a better dehumidifying unit. Otherwise we'd choose somewhere else, as it just made for some uncomfortable nights sleeping.

The weather had changed (with lots of rain), and I know southern cities have cockroach problems in hotels, but I don't expect this from a Hampton Inn. The management was very responsive, and gave me the night free - they were very apologetic and said they hadn't seen one in 'months'.

The hotel is a renovated warehouse with sky-high ceilings, beautiful antique furniture and lush tropical plants. The interior designers and architects have pulled off a tricky job: they have managed to create an impressive, dignified lobby that is also warm and inviting. My room was extremely comfortable and clean, with all the usual luxurious amenities (a firm bed, lots of fluffy pillows, fragrant toiletries, thick towels, etc.). My stay at the Hampton Inn was especially pleasant for two reasons. First, buffet breakfast and dinner were provided with the room rate. The night I had dinner at the hotel, the buffet menu included creole shrimp, creamy potato-leek soup, salad and the most delicious brownies I have ever had. Breakfast was equally good: a spread of cereals, pastries, fruit and hot food. Second, the staff at the Hampton Inn are to be commended for their warmth and hospitality. My luggage did not arrive with me but the front desk, once alerted of this, provided me with additional toiletries and brought my bag up to my room as soon it arrived at midnight. Christopher at the front desk was efficient as well as informative and had a fount of stories about his roots in Lousiana (ask him about his pet snake!). The location of the hotel is ideal for convention-goers, though the area around the convention center was almost eerily quiet (people still haven't returned to New Orleans, unfortunately). There were few shops and restaurants open. The French Quarter is about a six or seven-minute cab ride away. In any other city, that would be a walkable distance but the weather in New Orleans, even in October, was unbearably hot and humid (and I say this as someone who grew up in a tropical country). Also, I was constantly advised by the natives to take cabs rather than walk. I am not sure if this is because I was there as a single female, or if the city is still relatively unsafe, or some combination of the two. Cabs are relatively cheap, but not always easy to come by -- once again, because of the lack of tourists. It might be an idea to have the phone number of a cab company handy. All in all, I was touched by the kindness and friendliness of the people in New Orleans and would love to stay at the Hampton Inn again.", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff, good value, nice rooms, a few Katrina related problems\u201d", "Author": "labber", "ReviewID": "UR5029049", "Content": "I stayed here for Jazzfest. It was not my first choice. I had initially reserved a room at a diff Hampton Inn that is closer to the French Quarter. A couple weeks before my arrival, I was informed that they could not honor my reservation becuase people who were staying to help with Hurricane work had extended their stay. As a result, Hampton unilaterally decided to switch me to their place at the Convention Center. Hampton allowed the same rate, and included dinner as well as breakfast. There was some initial confusion about this change, and I had some difficulty getting a written confirmation. However, after faxing them about the problem, I promptly got a written confirmation of all the changes. The hotel facilities are very nice. It is a renovated warehouse, so you have a sort of \"loft\" feeling. The decor is lovely, and everything was very clean. The location would be perfect for future convention goers - it is directly across the street from the convention center. The CC is cleaned up outside, though not yet opened. Location was also good for attending jazzfest, because shuttle buses left for the fairgrounds from the convention center. As reported about other NOLA hotels at this time, they appeared to be short of staff. We were advised on check in that rooms would only be serviced every other day -- though you could call for extra towels and other supplies. Given the circumstances in NOLA, I did not think this was unreasonable. It was obvious that staff was doing a very good job of keeping all the public areas spotless. Also could not locate any valet parking attendants when I checked in, so I did self parking which was convenient enough. There was a notice in our room that effective May 1, they were switching parking areas to a lot about a block away. I did not see that lot, so I can't say how safe or convenient that would be. The hotel is located in the warehouse district of town. There did not appear to be much hurricane related damage in the area. However, a lot of the restaurants and clubs in the area are closed, due to lack of staff and/or lack of tourists and others. Emirils restaurant is just a couple blocks away, and other interesting places are close by. It is a bit of a hike to the French Quarter, probably about 15-20 minutes. At present there is no complimentary shuttle from the hotel to the FQ. A cab to Bourbon Street cost about $6 Breakfast was standard Hampton fare - breads, bagels, danish, eggs and one other hot dish, fruits, juices, cereals. There hotel also served a complimentary dinner. Check to be sure this is included in your rate. It is not included in all rates, because they would check your room number before allowing you into the area. It is a buffet that is catered by the Convention Center catering company. (Seemed to be set up for people who were doing work restoring the convention center who were staying at the hotel.) The dinners were a nice buffet. Steak and Mahi Mahi one night. Veal and Pork another night. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and welcoming. They were very glad to have people there, and let you know how happy they were to see you.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mobile, AL", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "TU94", "ReviewID": "UR3795536", "Content": "My girlfriends and I stayed at this hotel during the Essence Festival - 4th of July weekend.

As I soon found out, that is by design and my first impression quickly changed into one of delight. As a previous reviewer aptly noted, this is not your typical Hampton Inn. Part of the hotel is a thoroughly renovated cotton mill/department store warehouse. Luckily, I got to stay in the renovated section by virtue of my Gold Hilton HHonors status. My room was wonderful - large, high-ceiling, clean and comfortable. High, comfortable, four-poster bed. Upscale wood furniture. Fridge and microwave provided. The old windows and brickwork on the exterior wall were preserved, adding to the vintage flavor of the facility. The lobby had what appeared to be original hardwood flooring, which had been excellently restored. It was evident that Hampton had put a lot of money into the renovation - the interior, at least. They seemingly did nothing to the exterior of the building but then again, you don't stay outside. There is complimentary wireless internet access in the room, and laundry facilities (dollar each to wash and dry) and an exercise room in the basement.

SO comfy in fact, we found 2 hotel guests sleeping on them at 1 am. Must have had a little too much fun on Bourbon Street!!! We reserved 2 rooms each with 2 double beds. We ended up getting two rooms both handicapped accessible, but one room was upgraded to a HUGE suite for the same price. We surely didn't mind. The room decor was cozy and colorful. These rooms were a steal at $98 with AAA. We were also within walking distance to downtown (~1 mile), but far enough to get some sleep. We had no problems with parking and had 2 cars to valet. Oh...and the valet guys were awesome. Also, we loved the breakfast which was included in the room rate. It was a full breakfast with eggs, sauage, muffins, etc. Everything was warm and yummy thanks to the 3 employees that kept an eye on everything.

They have a wonderful breakfast. I find it rare that hotels offer 5-6 different types of juices, 2 %, low fat, whole milk and any other type of beverages one can imagine.

My husband was told that they expect to add breakfast meats in the next few months. Our room was on the fourth floor. We had a fridge and microwave. The view wasn't much but the room was comfortable with a hugh Rice Bed and a sleeper couch. The #3 View Carre, a small bus which travels to the French Quaters dropped us off near the hotel and picked up up across the street atn the convention center. The staff did not have knowledge of transit passes or the routes of the buses which passes the hotel. Transit passes can be purchased in the River Walk Mall at a small store. The cost was $5.00 for 1 day and 12.00 for 3 days of unlimited transit usage. I would have rated this hotel excellent but, the staff should be a bit more knowledgeable of the transit system, since the #3 goes of duty at 7:10 p.m. Each night my husband and I walked several blocks to get back to the hotel.
