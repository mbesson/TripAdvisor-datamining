I am giving this property a 5 star rating not because it is a \"5 star hotel\" but rather it was good value for your money.

The beds were somewhat hard but after a long day out it really did not make a difference in having a good nights sleep.

The hotel is located in a residential neighborhood with a lot of schools so in general found the area pretty safe. Every night we come into the lobby I think it is the night manager he stands right in the lobby to greet you which I also think is a security measure. I've also noticed him patrolling the halls periodically. The restaurant below is adequate though you don't have to walk far to get to the many other dining options available. The only downside which may be important to some people are there is no Internet in the rooms and the closest MTR station is still a good 10 minute away. If Internet access is important as it was for me and didn't want to make the trek to the lobby each time, I just got myself a prepaid SIM for my IPhone for $198HK which pretty much gave me unlimited data for my 10 day stay. Otherwise you can just go down to the lobby area to use the wifi they have there for free. Since we had a family of four sharing a cab the cost was pretty close to taking the MTR anyways.

I didn't expect anything more than a hostel, but we were pleasantly surprised - it is indeed a Guesthouse with some Hotel amenities. The Anne Black Guesthouse is situated in a dated skyscraper on a busy intersection of Waterloo road. The entrance is around the corner and up a steep hill, across the basketball court (or as a short-cut on the escalators located in the library building that you pass). It's an easy and pleasant 15-min walk from Mongkok Station - even with luggage - and recognizable from afar. The lobby looks like there was an attempt to give it somewhat of a modern appeal - in contrast to the building itself - is small but well suited for a Guesthouse and void of any frills. The elevators are small, but adequate. The room was dated, spartan with twin beds, a sink, small closet, small desk and a TV on top of a small fridge - and clean, with crisp white linens. On the desk a tray with water-cooker, tea, instant-coffee etc. which we used frequently. (But only after having overcome the initial shock over the \"coffee\" offered, us coming from the \"Latte-Capital\" of the world ;) I felt really lucky with our room located on the quiet side of the building and not facing noisy Waterloo Road. The bathroom across the hallway was absolutely bare, no frills whatsoever, no outlet for your grooming tools - the only amenity was a small mirror - But it was clean and everything functioned. The staff are helpful, pleasant and efficient. No problem with WiFi, available in the lobby and adjacent restaurant only. The Guesthouse, including the restaurant - and in particular the lobby - can be a \"zoo\", as it seems to be the preferred accommodations and assembly point for droves of young teenagers from neighboring countries on their school excursions. The adjacent restaurant is apparently a local favorite, dated, a bit shabbily decorated in a true \"Elvis\" theme - LOL- and of course well equipped for karaoke, if one should desire so and throw a party ! It is fun and perfectly safe to roam the area at day/night and find great places to eat all the wonderful offerings of local Chinese cuisine.

Shower curtains are hard to find and by the time I did find one, I had already moved to the other room on another floor. Staff are friendly, but elevators are small and slow.

The hotel also provides transportation to the airport for 110 HKD or roughly 14 USD. The hotel is clean as is the bathroom and the restaurant food was decent. The blinds are raggedy and internet is expensive. I do not have wifi. Use the internet at the Chungking Mansion instead. They also have laundry services on the 6th floor for 20 HKD each wash and dry and an iron. Bring ur own soap since theirs is built into the washing machine and woefully inadequate. I also liked the adjoining book room, but no bibles are available. Bring ur own. I did not like not having a refridgerator in the room. Last year I did have one. Buy an Octopus card and take bus 7 to Nathan Road. There are restaurants and a 7/11 close by the hotel so you can buy ur own water, tea and instant coffee. Bring shower shoes and make ur own coffee and tea with the kettle provided. The staff cleans daily and leave toothbrushes, shower caps and soap. Towels are large and clean. Also, the area is very safe and the rooms with shared bathrooms are large by Hong Kong standards. It is fun to eat the warm egg tarts from the nearby bakery for breakfast.

I visited my GirlFriend Fiona(best woman in the world). When I arrived the staff was friendly but they never seem to smile. But this seemed to be very common when I was in HK. I stayed in room 1119 and 1109. The rooms were very clean. The bed is a bit hard but nothing to worry about. There is a television in the room that offers 5 stations where 2 of them are English. The rooms have AC that worked very well. The bathrooms are shared but they are very very clean. Make sure you bring slippers. Towels, shampoo, and soap are provided. WIFI Internet is free but there were times it did not work. The WIFI does not work in the rooms. You have to go to the lobby to get online. If you want to get online for free, go to the library. The library is to the left of the hotel. There is a restaurant on the lobby floor. The restaurant had very good food. The hotel is located in a safe area. Alot of foreigners stayed in the hotel when I was there. The hotel is close to Waterloo Road, which offers plenty of buses to get you to anywhere in HK. I used the buses alot. They are very inexpensive. I have read alot of the reviews on this site about Anne Black Guest House and I was surprised that some visitors gave this hotel a bad rating. I was very happy with my stay at Anne Black. Its not a perfect hotel. But if you are looking to stay at a place that is affordable, clean, and safe. Go to Anne Black. The Anne Black Hotel is the best you can buy in Hong Kong for the price they charge you. Do not go to Hostels in HK. They offer you practically nothing and they are not safe. Almost all the hostels in HK that I researched are very small and they usually do not give you what they claim to have. Me and my GirlFriend went online to search for Hostels in Hong Kong. We found a few that we liked so we decided to go look at them. We thought we found some great Hostels for great prices. But when we went to the Hostels to look at the rooms, we were shocked to see that the pictures of the rooms that the Hostels said they were renting were not even close to being what the room actually was. Every Hostel that me and my Girlfriend visited did not offer a room that was worth staying. Once again, DO NOT STAY AT HOSTELS unless you have absolutely no other options. There is a church service on Sunday morning at Anne Black on the lobby floor. The church is OK but not great! If you are a Christian and you want to get a good message then go to the church service at Anne Black on Sunday morning at 10am. If you want to go to a really great church then go to the ICA Church on Hong Kong Island. I hope this was helpful. If anyone wants to ask me more about the Anne Black Guest House or if you have any questions about Hong Kong. Feel free to contact me at my email and I will be happy to tell you whatever you want to know about Hong Kong or about the Anne Black Guest House.

Mistake # 1... I took teh airport express shuttle which dropped me at the hotel close to the YWCA. Bad idea - the hostel is located on an upward slope on a road hidden behind buildings. It took me 15 minutes of asking and poking to find the path. (Despite being able to SEE the building!) Finally, I called the hostel and they told me to come via the public librarry (there are no signboard anywhere en route) - nut comfortable when you are lugging around the luggage. So my suggestion - pay 50 Hkg dollars and take a cab fromt eh airport express Kowlooon. Check in was quick, the otel is not exactly bright and sprightly, neither dull. Staff is polite as would be expected in a YWCA, there are always some community services happening on the lower floors so tehre are always peopel around. The room itself was very small - me and my 2 bags could just about fit in. (I took the larger room costing 450 dollars). Now this IS the best you will get in Hkg for 450 dollars. Rooms are clean (Best part - they have huge windows), air con. The TV has 6 channels (1 English - the rest are Cantonese / Mandarin). There is a hot ware kettle (remember to bring your own tea / coffee). The restaurant is really good - large, inexpensive, quick service, good food. Taxis are easy to get, and while the hostel is located in the midst of residences, a public library and schools, it is 5 minutes walk from the main Waterloo road. The MTR is a good 15 minute trek, through the busy streets of Mongkok. I just wish rooms had wifi - they do not. So, to use internet, you need to go to the reception (always full of people, no place to sit) or the restaurant.

They have internet room which is cheap to use and the hotel itself is very very safe as the Manager was strict about visitors. The bedding is very spic and span. The restaurant is wonderful - both indoor and an outside food bar with fresh cooked food while you wait. The waiters are brilliant and will have you laughing your heads off. the food is delicious and very cheap in comparison to New Zealand - I couldnt believe it - . A wonderful place for backpackers -its very inexpensive. We met some great people from all over the world but the nicest were the locals and the workers from the hotel. Highly recommended especially if you are travelling alone and female. The staff will keep an eye out for you but you must hail cabs from outside the hotel or call them from your room - . A great stay and lots of fun. Definitely recommend and I'll be heading back there in 2011/2012. It is a no frills hotel but very well run and extraordinary staff of cleaners, waiters, guides. A note about the taxi cabs in HK - they are dirt cheap - for the cost of a cab to take you half way round Hong Kong and back is the same price as driving 4KM in an NZ cab.
