We stayed at the Hotel Florencia for three night in May, 2006. Our only regret was that it wasn't longer. The breakfast buffet was good, the rooms were nice and clean and the staff was very accomodating, easpecially the head bellman. The area has a lot of great shopping, both high class and artesianal. Antique stores and great restaurants are everywhere. We really enjoyed the seafood restaurant The Los Arcos, which is within walking distance of the hotel. If you take a taxi take a regular taxi (not a green volkswagon) instead of one of the hotel taxis because the hotel taxis will cost you about three times more.We will stay in this hotel again as it was one of the best medium priced hotels that we have found in Latin America.", "Date": "May 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR375395066", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "crafterincr"}, {"Content": "Me cobraron dos veces en mi tarjeta de cr\u8305dito   showReview(8260255, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR698989765", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "cuchaviajera"}, {"Content": "me encantar\u8d38n los desayunos de huevos   showReview(5425013, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR596760723", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d154674-r20145909-Hotel_Plaza_Florencia-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "154674", "Price": "$115"}}
