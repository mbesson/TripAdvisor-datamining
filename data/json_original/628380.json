{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Something not quite right about Tu Casa Apartments As a group of 11, we thought that having apartments in Berlin would be better than booking a hotel, so when we found the Tu casa apartments we were extremely pleased.We called them a week in advance to finalise the booking and arrange the \u9225\u6e1fhuttle service\u9225?(as advertised from their website) to come and pick us up from the airport.Everything was in order until the day we departed when we called again to ensure that we would be picked up, only to be told that we would have to make our own way to the apartments, incurring a 90 euros charge.We then arrived at the road, saw a sign for Tu casa but couldn\u9225\u6a9b see where we had to go. It turns out that there is no reception, and the building is actually a residential block with a few holiday apartments but the majority belonging to Berlin residents, meaning that noise had to be kept to a minimum at all times. After we met Hubert on the 3rd floor we were shown to our apartments, which we not like the pictures on the website especially the kitchen that could barely fit 1 person in, let alone space for preparing food.We were then told that we had to pay immediately for our whole booking, in CASH (2340 euros in total) as their card machine had broken. As this was unexpected we had had to then use the cash machine which because if our card limits would only let us take out 400 euros at a time incurring various bank charges totalling to about \u62e270. When trying to explain and the situation and reason with Hubert, he was extremely uncooperative and when we asked for a 100 euros reduction in price (to cover the bank charges and taxi to and from the airport) we were told that if we didn\u9225\u6a9b pay then it would be taken off the card. How the whole lot (2340 euros) couldn\u9225\u6a9b be taken off the card in one go, I do not understand and will never understand.I would NOT recommend this apartment to anyone, there is something very dodgy about it and I would advise tourists to Berlin to stay somewhere significantly more official.", "Date": "Jun 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR978320563", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ktp27"}, {"Content": "Tu-Casa - K\u679annen wir nicht empfehlen.   showReview(22401479, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR357226005", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "adviceme"}, {"Content": "Buon rapporto qualit\u813f/prezzo e qualche consiglio per i prossimi ospiti   showReview(8378210, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR166421167", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Sparkling73"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d628380-r7872330-Tu_Casa_Apartments-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "628380", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
