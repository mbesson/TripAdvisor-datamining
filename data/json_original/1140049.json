Since Holiday Inn had offered and accepted the rate through their on-line reservation system, and I had a confirmation number, I requested that they honor the rate for that night. To my amazement, they took a hard line stance and refused to honor the reservation made through their reservation system. It was a situation that clearly called for compassion and the lack of concern by the management was chilling. In the past, my interaction with the staff had been great. The facility is new and the rooms are nice. This had been my hotel of choice at MDW before the horrible customer service experience. If they would treat a frequent corporate customer so poorly, as a customer, how can you be sure that they will honor the rate and how can you be sure that they would honor your reservation?

We were picked up at the airport by the hotel's shuttle, which comes literally every 10 minutes, and then were greeted by helpful and cheerful staff who were smiling and willing to assist us throughout the whole stay! The rooms are quiet, clean, and modern, and the whole hotel environment is very pleasant and up to date. It was a delightful stay overall, and we really appreciated the friendliness of the staff and the shuttle drivers!

Once I called downstairs to report them missing, they immediately began to find out where they were. The security guy decided to check the vaccuum cleaner (thinking they may have fell off the counter) and he FOUND ONE OF THE EARRINGS!! He then continued to look through the vacuum and when he didn't find the second one, he looked through the trash and found the SECOND EARRING! The backs were a little bent up so the manager then came out and told me that they would pay for diamond's to be reset.

Brand new rooms, gorgeous decor...I had to check again to make sure it was a Holiday Inn. I travel about 9 months out of the year, all over the world, and quite frankly...this is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in. It is in a complex with 6 or so other properties (Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton, Marriott, Courtyard, Holiday Inn Express, Residence Inn and a Sleep Inn) They all look brand new. This room has beautiful linens, dark wood decor, flat panel tv, HS internet, etc. It truly looks like a much more expensive property. The restaurant, Coaches, was very nice as well. The Cobb salad was loaded with blue cheese, bacon, a grilled chicken breast, etc. So big I had to take 1/2 back to the room. All I can say is I am impressed! Only drawback is the area (right outside Midway Airport) but you can jump on the shuttle back to the airport and take the Orange line into the city (which I plan to do tomorrow night) if you want some nightlilfe, etc. but I have a big day tomorrow so it was nice to have an awesome room to relax in to prepare for my meeting. There are also two other restaurants in the complex (Dempsey's at the Marriott and a TGI Friday's) so there are some choices if you are here for a short stay and need to be close to Midway. From the looks of the other hotels, I would imagine they are all very nice, but this is one extremely nice Holiday Inn. Great staff too! Wish I had brought my camera because I would really like to copy this decor for my bedroom at home.", "Date": "February 10, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Holiday Inn Chicago - Midway Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g35805-d1140049-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Chicago_Midway_Airport-Chicago_Illinois.html", "Price": "$148 - $209*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">6624 S Cicero Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Chicago</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">IL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">60638</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1140049", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f4/3d/f43d50d913feca9f2740599b10d79ec69large.jpg"}}
