We took the express bus from the Airport to P. Roma, then a vaparetto to San Zaccaria stop. With bags on wheels it was a quick walk to the Hotel, which was easy to find. This was an easy trip and much less expensive than other transportation options. We arrived fairly early, dropped our bags downstairs and headed out to enjoy the city. The rooms were clean, spacious for Italy and very quiet. Yes, you have to climb stairs. Luckily, we weren't in and out of the hotel too much during the days. The desk staff was very helpful and greeted us like old friends when we returned for the second half of our stay. The light breakfast was perfectly fine. The rolls were delicious! Don't come down late, though. We came in just before the breakfast hours ended and someone shooed us away and began turning the lights out just after we sat down. Be aware that a full bath may mean a half size tub with a hand sprayer and no shower curtain. Having our own private terrace and a beautiful view of San Zaccaria more than made up for small inconviences like tub size or stair climbing. St. Marks is a short walk away as is a vaparetto stop. We had no trouble finding our way back to the Hotel from where ever we were touring. It's not the Ritz, but for the price and location, we enjoyed our stay and would happily return there.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aspen, CO.", "Title": "\u201clovely hotel- Breakfast was great!\u201d", "Author": "CrazyT", "ReviewID": "UR20130753", "Content": "The Fontana Hotel by far exceeded our expectations for the price we paid and its location. Sure the room wasn't huge, but we got two ensuite doubles for the price of a triple. It was the perfect setup for us and our 8 yr old son. When my husband started snoring, I even had a spare bed to crawl into! Even though there were a lot of stairs, I wouldn't trade the view of San Zaccaria's church and Venice rooftops for a lift ever! Our son's room was tiny, but becasue it was situated in a corner, each side with a window, there was plenty of cross ventilation. Had there not been, we were offered a fan. Our room had an air conditioner that actually kept all of the rooms pretty pleasant. We actually ended up just opening the windows at night and plugging in the little electronic anti bug scented devices that were provided. They seemed to work as we never saw or experienced any bugs in our romm, though they were about outside. Although the bathroom too took up a corner, it had been recently remodeled with modern amenities, and it's L shape actually provided for more movable space not less. In fact, it was it's situation directly under the gabled roof that gave this room its charm. The whole hotel staff ran the place very efficiently from baking fresh rolls on site for breakfast to keeping the rooms spotless and fully supplied daily. Diego's fluent English, local knowledge, and good cheer especially made the reception warm. He made us feel personally welcomed upon our arrival, and treated us as if we were long awaited old friends. He really seemed to want to hear about our adventures each day too. You could tell he really loved his city and wished others also to do so. The owner's recommendations for dinner were spot on, and it would seem he and his family have lived there -perhaps even somewhere on site -for a long time. We were especially pleased with the breakfasts as I had not expected much after reading the reviews. I don't know what one would expect a \"continenal breakfast buffet\" to contain, but it certainly met our needs. I'd be as fat as a pig if I were able to eat fresh baked Italian rolls daily as we did there! My son was warned not to expect much, so he was particulary pleased to find Coco Puffs on offer as well as several other \"boring\" cereals. Although we did not partake of the full bar, we did enjoy having access to the inexpensive beers and sodas available on site. How nice to be able to grab an ice cold beer on the way back to the room at the end of a hot day. Diego also kindly let us store our bags at the hotel after we had checked out, enabling us to do some final sightseeing on our final half day. Lastly, the location could not have been quieter or more convenient. I was worried that with restaurants on the Calle down below it might be noisy, but they literally rolled up the awnings and took the whole place away by 10pm! Calle San Zaccaria is so deserted after the day trippers leave that the locals bring out their toddlers to ride their \"Big Wheels\". After hearing horror stories of lost tourists wandering around hauling suitcases, I also couldn't believe how easy it was to find the hotel. Once I realized it sits on the backside of the Calle San Zaccaria, all we had to do was follow the signs for San Zaccaria Church about 2 LEVEL blocks from the Vaporetto/Alilaguna stop. Easy to pick out on any map too for the same reason, but I never did end up needing one. In the early morning it seemed to be the route of choice for local business people commuting in from the outer islands and mainland. They made for some interesting people watching. I would think coming in to the St. Z stop from the mainland would be much quicker than trying to fight the crowds by commuting down the Grand Canal. As has been noted, the only drawback is that there are 4 ( 5 for Americans) floors and no elevator, They tell me they are putting one in, but I almost wonder if that will spoil some of the \"old world \" charm of the place. The TVs in the room could also use a bit of upgrading as they have to be \"tuned in.\" But who comes to venice to watch TV? For those who must, there is a very nice flatscreen in the bar area. Internet would be a nice, modern addition. Good value for the money, though (great for Venice) and the location is superb.", "Date": "September 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon UK", "Title": "\u201cCentral Venice\u201d", "Author": "Timems", "ReviewID": "UR19606908", "Content": "Awesome location, brilliant staff.
