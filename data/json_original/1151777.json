Country-SUPER! Before leaving, the hotel chose an inexpensive and conveniently located. We planned to travel a lot around the city (shopping trips), so there was no sense to take an expensive hotel for sleep. Eat at the hotel was nekolko times. For breakfast - hard time waking up, after a late return, but if you go to 10 hours - there is little left, and all the tables occupied. Do not skip lunch, too difficult, because walking around town or shopping at this time. though in the afternoon problem with the table was not, the people less. For lunch, all delicious and satisfying. Although a small selection. The city has many cafes, shops, so that power will be no problems. The hotel is quite normal (if you do not sit there all day, this is not a beach of 5 stars). They lived on the seventh floor of the left wing. Many people write about the hotel's red - night clubs till 3 am. Yes, it's true. On the 7th, too, is very audible. The room has everything you need, I'm sorry there is no set of tea and coffee. Some rooms do not have a hair dryer. The rooms really are small, but we had enough. Conveniently located near the subway, walk to town can be reached, never used the bus to the beach is much more comfortable and more convenient to use a taxi, the prices are normal. In general for ourselves understood: food and hotel bus - for those who can live on a schedule. We are convenient to decide when and where to go, you can take the hotel with no food. A taxi took on the street. Al rig, to Al Mamzar beach is not expensive. At the Dubai Mall and Emirates Mall went to the subway, in the gold class, and comfortable and convenient. In this hotel would have gone, we recommend for active travelers.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chennai", "Title": "\u201cNot a very good place\u201d", "Author": "pr_sharad", "ReviewID": "UR123815242", "Content": "Eureka as the name goes really doesnt give you that feeling. We had to stay here because our travel agent put us up here. We had arrived early (about 9am) only to be told that there are no rooms available and we need to wait until 2pm to check it as that is the hotel policy. After a little chit chat, we were told that we can check it at 12noon...after requesting them again that we had early appointments, we were asked to pay 50% of the room charges for an early checkin. Finally they ask us to pay USD$55 for allowing us to check in at 09.30 hrs!!!! The website states a rate, the front office displays another rate & finally when you go into your room, you will find totally another rate! Very ridiculous... Added to it, they wanted us to pay 100% up front... again unlike many other hotels that we had stayed in. The hotel looks ok from the outside, rooms are quite small with literally no space to walk around. While the rooms are clean, it still needs a make over as paint has come off in many places. Breakfast is not very good. Would advice you to check out the place before you book or check in!", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "SZavahir", "ReviewID": "UR122869426", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel, not out of choice, but rather because I just needed somewhere to rest my weary feet and bags during my whirlwind shopping stop in Dubai. It is very noisy, as it has not 1 but 2 clubs in the hotel.One is an arab club and the other an indian one - both types of music are very different and clash! Fortunately I was only staying for the day, I managed to get some sleep in the day. They have a great room service menu.My TV didnt work, but at least they had a complimentary shuttle to and from the airport. They also had a complimentary shuttle to and from Deira City Centre.

Did the booking via email to the hotel directly and was offered a cheaper summer rate of 200 AED inclusive of airport shuttle,breakfast and their daily shuttles to the different malls and the beach. Stayed in a double room with twin beds which was very adequate and comfortable. Flat screen tv with english speaking channels. AC was good. the rooms got cleaned everyday. Location was also good,quiet area. Close to city center and reef mall. Most taxis do not know the hotel because it's small so it helps to hold the hotel business card with you which has a map with directions to the hotel from the major alrigga road to help out the taxi drivers. Laarni at the front desk who did our booking was sweet. Could faintly hear the music from the nightclub on the 4th floor but it wasn't disturbing.
