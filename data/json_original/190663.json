The whole of Berlin is covered by the U & S Bahn trains. Tip- Buy a Berlin Welcome card for 25 Euros, it gives 3 days unlimited travel on buses and trains right out to Potsdam and the airports, also gives great discounts on Berlin attractions. The hotel staff were very nice and spoke good English, breakfast was excellent, cold meats, cheeses, salad, breads etc, all served in spacious dining room. Our room was very large with a beautiful ceiling and chandaleir. It also had a seperate couch and work table. The room was not modern but was tastefully decorated and very clean. The room was well heated despite the freezing tempratures outside. We had a large corner bath in a seperate bathroom, which was very nice but took about 30 minutes to fill. The bathroom also had a hair shower attached to bath with a short pipe. As the bath took so long to fill, in the mornings we had to hold the hair shower over each other to get a shower. All good clean fun and it made for a memorable hoilday experience. If you didn`t know your room mate too well before your stay, you will afterwards! A very nice hotel full of character and charm that you don`t get in the big chain hotels.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cbest find of the trip\u201d", "Author": "EEM88", "ReviewID": "UR115556451", "Content": "Hotel Wittelsbach in Berlin was definitely the best deal of our whole three week trip.

We had a spacious room and a four piece bath, and every morning we were treated to a fantastic breakfast buffet, which included everything from yoghurt to juice, cheese and cold cuts, cereals, breads, tea, coffee and cake. And for all of this we paid \u20ac49 a night for both of us. The only problems: no internet in the room.

I have seen two rooms and they looked very different: smaller and a kind of shabby. I have booked a single room and was given a very small room right behind the reception. There was a gap between door and wall, so you could hear everything from the reception desk including the radio. Sleeping was impossible, so I asked for another room. The receptionist first told me that they are fully booked. As I wanted to check out and move to another hotel suddenly there was another room. The smell of smoke was unbearable, the hotel homepage tells about nonsmoking rooms... I ended up in Motel One and highly redcommend it.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant brilliant brilliant\u201d", "Author": "therock59", "ReviewID": "UR53211250", "Content": "hotel and staff were excellent.

The faded Tyrol type kitch decor was quite endearing. The room was large with a little fridge but no kettle. Clean. Breakfast was great apart from the coffee machine. Plenty of hot water. I am allergic to feathers so asked for another pillow and that wasn't a problem. Very close to the nearest underground station. A nice area with older buildings but very dimly lit streets at night. Now that I know my way it won't be a problem but I was glad that I wasn't on my own the first night whilst looking for the place. If you're a woman travelling alone and arriving at night I would recommend taking the tube to K'damn ( main street not far away) and then getting a taxi to the hotel. Have some cash on you because none the little shops in the area would take my card. A small supermarket called \"Kaisers\" just round the corner.", "Date": "November 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich", "Title": "\u201caffordable relaxed elegant hotel\u201d", "Author": "clariyt", "ReviewID": "UR47324595", "Content": "we stayed for four nights - nothing bad to say about this hotel.
