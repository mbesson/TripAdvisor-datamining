There was a mix up upon arrival--don't know if it was false advertizing on the part of the owner or just a mistake. We were told we were at the Colosseo B & B (apparently same owner). It wasn't looking very promising. The young man there was very friendly and helpful and we did get to this hotel. The desk attendant was very friendly and helpful. We had trouble with the TV and he spent some time and effort fixing it. while the breakfast wasn't expansive it was good. The room itself was clean and of adequate size, good air conditioning (not used to 30+ temps). The biggest issue was the lack of a lift. At the end of a day of touring we took to calling the steps \"Mt. Everest.\" there was a mix up with the taxi on our day of departure (there being two instead of one). The location was fantastic--just a short distance from the Roman Forum. We would probably stay here again just because of the location and the helpful staff (a contrast to our stay in Florence).", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Limerick, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cfawlty towers\u201d", "Author": "loganmurrayam", "ReviewID": "UR86492211", "Content": "this is not a hotel it is a B&B without the cosiness. the owners do not live on site and the \"hotel\" is located within private residences including a dentist. no reception area and the noise form the street is like sleeping beside an underground.

Not a place for a honeymoon or regular stay, we left without staying one night as it was filthy and unsettling. We did not feel our belongings were safe at this location as it is completely open to the remainder of the building and there is no staff kept on duty; upon arrival we looked for any sign of life for about 20 minutes. The only person we found was a disheveled cleaning lady who handed us a set of four keys, no one asked for our passports or a credit card; as is normal practice. We opted to drag our luggage around Rome with us until a suitable/ clean option was found. Other: LOUD and AC does not work. Upon returning to the hotel to shower after an afternoon of hauling baggage around Rome, still awaiting word on another place, it was clear someone had been in the room while we were gone. As we opened the door to leave an angry Italian woman appeared abruptly, never introducing herself and had heard from our travel agent that we would not be staying. She yelled at us that we would stay and insisted that the room was not dirty, she blocked the doorway and would not allow us to leave the room. We proceeded to show her the dirty cups, bathroom, stains on the bed linens, walls and curtains. She continued to insist it was clean, and calling me an \"American Sausage!\", we left the hotel around 3:00pm and received a call minutes later that she had charged for the night's stay immediately upon our departure. Funny that we couldn't find a soul to check in with, and never formally did, but we could be charged within moments of departure.The following hotel felt like Heaven in comparison.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNoisy B&B\u201d", "Author": "Sam188590", "ReviewID": "UR83030089", "Content": "They call it a hotel but it's not.

It's a b&b and I'm nice because a b&b is even a lot better then the Foro Romano Imperatori. I could accept to pay 40 Euro, but 125 is unacceptable for what we got! First of all, when we arrived in front of the hotel, it looks like a regular building, not like a hotel. We rang, we got inside and we had to go to the second floor to find the \"reception\" and the breakfast room. after that we had to go to the 4th floor without elevator because you need a key to use it and we don't have the key. The room was little, not really clean. The bathroom was a joke, the noise from the street was aweful (it was like sleeping directly on the sidewalk) and it was extremely cold (and the supplementary blanket was soooooo dusty). The breakfast was a joke also. Some fruits, but liing there for like 3 weeks, they could almost walk alone. The croissant, bread and everything else was hard and old. On the website they say that they have a room where we can put the luggage after the check out...It's FALSE...there's nothing. We had to fight to find a solution so that we could leave our luggage in a safe place because they wanted us to leave them in the middle of the corridor, where anybody could have taken it. One other thing, there's nobody at the reception. Only one person comes for the breakfast and for the check-in/check-out...otherwise you can't ask anything because nobody's there. The only good thing are the location, close to the Coliseum and the Foro. They \"try\" to be friendly and the roomservice (room cleaning because there is no roomservice) was ok...I say \"was ok\" because it was a good surprise, we tought we had to do everything ourself. Oh...and one other thing, we had to pay in advance, at the check-in. We will NEVER go there again...to much expensive for a such crappy hotel...how can they call it a luxury hotel...how can they call it a hotel at all !!!", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Foro Romano Imperatori", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1011237-Reviews-Foro_Romano_Imperatori-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$92 - $1,320*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Cavour 294</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00184</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1011237", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e3/62/e3627b2b3d8b44f837627524d3cdb0481large.jpg"}}
