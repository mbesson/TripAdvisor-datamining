They were absolutely spot on. Location was perfect for walking to many places. The nearby cafes were great for breakfast (which was not included with our room reservation). Front desk staff was very helpful - in English. Only tip that I do not recall from other reviews is that room key must be inserted in wall box to make lights in room work.

Our small 6th floor double room (definitely the servants floor when the hotel was built in the 19th century) had everything we needed and the shower room was spacious and well supplied with nice fluffy towels and toiletries. The refurbishment completed last year has been well done and the place feels fresh. This place seems good for business and pleasure - especially shopping. Although it is on a busy street and our room was on the front at the top, we were not troubled by either street or a/c noise. The staff were professsional and very helpful and the location is excellent The only down side was an unexpected meanness in the supply of teabags (just one each of ordinary and mint tea) - a contrast with the 2 shampoos and 2 shoe cleaners in the bathroom. When we asked for one additional bag - we were told that was not possible - by staff who were clearly embarrassed! We suggest people who want to drink tea in their room here bring their own teabags - a small price to pay for an otherwise very decent place. We would happily return to the Atlantic", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA great choice in a premium location.\u201d", "Author": "Madisonineurope", "ReviewID": "UR117011041", "Content": "Very lovely hotel with a nice staff and a pleasant room.

I had a very nice stay and would definitely recommend it. We were there with a group and our baby only woke up others once. The walls are not thick enough for a really screamy baby, though. A few minor drawbacks: only a bath, no shower; the baby crib was somehow broken in the bottom which meant she was sleeping on a slant; it's close to the train but far from the RER; there is no restaurant, only breakfast; the day staff were pretty cold; the breakfast was pretty unhealthy; the room itself was not huge and the only clock was embedded into the TV (pretty small). Altogether, I had a great time and would definitely stay again.

The next morning, on one of our covers and bed sheets, there were streaks of blood. We had to check if we were bleeding. We weren't, and so we were puzzled where the blood came from. We also saw some black little spots on the bed sheets, but thot it was just from old stains. A little later, my friend started to have red spots all over her arms, and started to itch. We informed the hotel to check, and they steam cleaned the beds. When we came back later in the day, we found bed bugs crawling all over the bed! They must have crawled out after the steam. We demanded for something to be done, but the staff kept telling us they have already cleaned the room. I asked him to come and take a look and he agreed they were bugs. He spoke to the manager who then agreed to give us a new room. The next day when we were checking out, all the manager offered was half the room rate for the last day!!! It was not a compensation at all! When i demanded at least further discount, the manager gave me a very stinking look and very grumpily agreed to give another half a day off. We are still itching today, 4 days after checking out. They insisted this has never happened before, but well, it does now!!! STAY THERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!! Who knows if the bugs have crawled from that one room to the rest of the rooms!!!!

Overall, we were quiet satisfied with the room comfort (small, as usual for Paris, with a queen and a twin bed), the service, cleanliness, and the decent breakfast. I would note that the bathroom was a super-sized for Paris, though. We got a reasonable deal with breakfast included via the hotel Web site, but I would say there was some confusion about exactly what allowed one to get the best rates on the site (for example, 4 nights for the price of 3, which was advertised). The hotel was kept in good condition throughout, and the quiet AC was a real winner since Paris was hot that week and there was a fair amount of street noise. All desk and other personnel were friendly and willing to help in any way possible (communicating with some mixture of our French and their English, neither great). Note that the elevator is tiny, and this would not be good for wheelchair- bound folks. Being near the station was not really much of a help as the station itself does not connect to any major sights or international connections, but there was an associated Metro nearby that could get you anywhere quickly. It was a quick taxi ride to Gare du Nord, also, where you can connect to Eurostar, Thalys, etc. There is a small reasonably priced fruit stand and snack shop right across the street. There are several restaurants and cafes in the area which were serviceable. I would have given an overall 4 for the hotel if not for a huge problem that arose: the hotel internet service (Swisscom, a pretty common wi-fi provider in Europe) stopped working the first day and still was not fixed when we left 3 days later. The staff were apologetic, but someone really dropped the ball on this one given the absolute need for internet access these days to check emails, buy tickets, call overseas phones, etc. It was possible to get some wi-fi service via a cafe nearby, but it was limited one short session per day and pretty flaky. I down-rated on service due to the wi-fi problem only.", "Date": "July 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "detroit", "Title": "\u201ccozy\u201d", "Author": "yatraman", "ReviewID": "UR24153992", "Content": "its a cozy hotel great bakery on the corner about a minute away", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dumfries, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery clean and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Kat_April08", "ReviewID": "UR14794846", "Content": "This hotel was very clean and comfortable.

The bathroom was very clean and the personnel cleaned it every day. Location of the hotel is also good and near one of the metro station. Near hotel there are restaurants and bars as well as small store with fresh fruits and vegetables and other products just on opposite site from the hotel. At the same time for the people who are very sensitive to the noise we would recomend to book rooms on higher floor if possible. Since you can really hear and feel a metro in the late evening. The breakfast was also nice and with big but usual selection: different type of bread, egg, honey, jam, cheese, ham, jogurt, juice, etc. The personnel always at the begining was asking what we would drink tee or coffee. The breakfast room is of average size but not enough for all hotel guests. But it was only one time that we had bad luck and bad time to wait for a place there.
