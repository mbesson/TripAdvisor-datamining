I was in Singapore last week as an official for the Mettle Games, this was the official hotel that the organizer arranged for the athletes & officials. The location as other reviewers here mentioned, is quite good. However, as with the case with many hotels in Singapore, I felt it was rather over-priced for what you are actually getting. First of all, the rooms are very run down & small. The carpet & bathroom had stains; the towels provided seemed very old & worn out. When I checked in, I was given a room on the 2nd floor; at the end of the corridor of the 2nd floor was the hotel's office of some sort, so there was a lot of traffic outside my door. My room's air-conditioner was not working, so the hotel manager (Mr. Jason) came by & checked it; he popped the cover off the A/C controller & tried to do some adjustments to the a/c but the A/C was still not working right. He then kindly offered to change my room. A few minutes later, I was showed another room on the 2nd floor, Room 201 - it had Air con, but no windows!! ( all '01' rooms in this hotel has NO window). I was then showed the same room I originally had, but on the 9th floor. The room was exactly the same but the AC seemed to work. Some 'Security' issues i had with this hotel;- - All the rooms i viewed & stayed in, the security chain/bar on the door of the rooms were broken. Looked like someone pushed the door in from the outside & broke the bar. On the doors itself, you can see the damage on the wooden doorframe & where the bars have been before & subsequently re-installed. - The room I stayed in, had an in-room safe; but the electronic keypad-front plate of the safe was missing, looked like it was broken off... the safe was locked & it had a piece of paper with \"out of order\" stuck on it. When I called the front desk to ask if they had a safety deposit box, they asked me to use the safe in the room. When I informed them the safe was broken, they offered to change my room again, to guess where? My ORIGINAL room with NO AC. -Breakfast was served every morning from 7 to 10 am or something. I checked it out but then opted to have breakfast nearby where there were many local restaurants & hawker stalls that had fresher food. -Towels in the bathroom seemed worn out & dirty -The shower in the bathroom had weak water pressure. -Amenities like soap & shampoo were mediocre, bring your own if you stay here. -Internet costs $$, for our package, it was included & I have to say the internet wifi connection was fast & strong signal, probably because the router was on the ceiling outside my room. - Many Mainland China Tourists were staying on my floor & they are generally loud & the walls of the hotel rooms don't insulate sound quite well. My own room was paid for by the organizer of the event, however for my team athletes, we paid for 2 rooms for them. I feel that for the price we paid, we could have got something much better, but this is Singapore after all.. I am just disappointed & surprised that a hotel of this standard exists in a city like Singapore. I gave 2 dots for my rating because of the friendly & helpful hotel manager Mr Jason. Otherwise, I would give one dot.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel during conference!\u201d", "Author": "worldcitizen87", "ReviewID": "UR117912928", "Content": "I stayed at the Oxford Hotel during a 1 week conference I had in March.

I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights last month during a 3 week trip around India, Malaysia, Japan and of course Singapore and it was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The only good thing about it is the location as mentioned in the other reviews. For the price we paid, it was simply a rip-off. We were given a room upon check-in where the air-conditioning was not working. Given the humid temp in Singapore, this was obviously essential. The bathroom was filthy and water was leaking in from the next suite. We complained and got another room. It was smaller but at least the air-conditioning was working. However, it was only a slight improvement. There were cockroaches in the bathroom and the walls are paper-thin so you can hear people coming and going at all hours during the night. The bedsheets were dirty. As well, it took the maids until 6pm to clean our room! Plus, they didn't even do a thorough job. No tissues were left even though it needed replenshing, the bathroom mirrors, sink and floor were not wiped clean and the bedroom floors were not vacummed. The room safe were not working and nothing was done to fixed it even though we complained. The service was terrible (the receptionists looked annoyed everytime you approached them) and the breakfast was so-so. Nothing to write home about.
