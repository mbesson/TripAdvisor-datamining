The location is very convenient to the I-17 freeway and there is lots of retail just on the other side of the freeway. Staff: Amazing staff that was super friendly and went out of their way to talk to us and assist where possible. There was one breakfast staff person that was actually kind of rude (I think her name was Lori? Not Edith who was great), but she did warm up over the course of my stay. Rooms: The rooms are actually on the nicer end of most Homewood's I've stayed in and it was great to have a kitchenette. My only two complaints are that I was in a 5th floor room and while my room was non-smoking, the rest of the floor did have smoking rooms. Two nights after I checked in, I went up and it REEKED in the hallways coming to and from my room. If I had known, I would have asked for a different floor. It smelled pretty bad for the rest of the stay. The second is the shower ... the water pressure was low and my water never got really hot hot. Just more than warm. Amenities: I did not use the pool or the gym, but the outdoor BBQ's are a nice feature and the on-site laundry was very convenient. The elevators are pretty slow, but I used the stairs most of the time. I also used the business center to print some things and I like that it was in a separate room and I never once had to wait for a computer. The free breakfast was nice and they did provide a variety of items. If you came down later in the service, things like bananas and so forth were gone, but I was always able to find something hot. The bagels were pretty rock hard though. They are serve a \"mini\" dinner a few nights a week and while not great, it was super convenient when I was in a rush or if you're looking to save money. The dinners included free wine and beer. This would be an excellent hotel for a budget-conscious family. You get the suite / separate bedroom set-up plus a kitchenette AND the hotel serves you breakfast and dinner.

Had 3 teenagers with us and it was a mixed family get away as well as a work meeting in town. The room was a nice size, but with 5 of us, it did feel a little small (even tho it was two rooms) The separate bedroom had two double beds, not queen sized, and believe me, when you are sharing, you can tell the difference! The pull out couch in living room was typically a bit uncomfortable but still was glad to have it. The beds in the bedroom had nice linens but the beds themselves were a little saggy. (or is that me??~!) The kitchen has a full size refrig with ice maker. A nice microwave and plenty of storage space. They provide paper towels, dishes, utensils, coffee, dishwasher soap! The bathroom had the sink outside of the toilet/shower area which is good for many getting ready at the same time. Nice toiletries were provided. One of the nicest amenities of the place is the \"light supper\" provided each evening from 5-7. This is a huge money saver esp when you are travelling with kids. AND the nice thing is they have fairly nutritious items provided, not just pizza bites and nachos! Night one we had meatloaf, veggies, mashed pots, rolls and salad. Night two we had make your own salad with chicken and beef strips, veg soup and bread sticks. ALso they provide some wine and beer, lemonade. They also have a changing hot menu for brkfast which again is fairly nutritious. I think this was the biggest reason why people with kids or many folks in their party should consider staying here....AND the people working here were wonderful!! Front desk, brkfast and supper workers, maids, maintenance guys...ALL were friendly, responsive and respectful. We called down a few times to get more towels, blankets etc and they were always RIGHT ON IT....we never waited for more than 3 minutes for anything we asked. the pool was green. Not sure why. It made it less appealing but the kids still had a good time in it. No jacuzzi tho which was sort of disappointing. BUT overall it's a fine hotel with great service, It is right off the interstate so easy to get to. Sort of \"hidden\" in with large offices etc so little or no noise. VERY close to Metrocenter mall and some restaurants near the mall....(remember I was with teenagers so even tho they ate the supper provided, they still needed add'l food by 9 pm!)

It was supposed to be a \"suite\", it was a 15x15 box, with a wall down the middle to make it a \"suite\". The fire alarm was torn off the wall. The artificial plants had at least 4 years of dust on them. The ethernet would not work. The phone cord fell out of the wall, when we tried to put the phone near where we were sitting. The \"computer tech\" called once, we got disconnected...and although we called the front desk at least 3 more times about this connection problem: the computer tech never returned our calls. The bedding and kitchen were clean (except for the plants), but every door in the suite: hit a dresser or a table. The decor was very outdated and dark. (not like the pictures on the website).

The staff at this hotel is consistently great. Very friendly, polite, and anxious to please. The rooms could do with some updating. Our couch was very dirty and had stains. More light in the vanity area would be good. The bed is great. Our air conditioning quit working our 3rd day and it took until 7 pm to get someone up to fix it. They said we had \"froze\" it because we set the temp at 70 degrees - it was 99 outside and our room got the full blast of the sun. The free breakfast and \"manager's reception\" have gone downhill since last year. Every morning was the round re-heated eggs and sausage, one time cold french toast was in a basket on the side of the toaster ( but the toaster was broken on one side), bread and bagels, cereal, plus canned fruit cocktail. No yogurt this time, no variety. They ran out of styro cups and napkins. Last year the breakfast varied with bacon, pancakes, french toast in the steamer some days. The evening reception was hot dogs and canned baked beans once, canned ravioli once, mac and cheese next time. Last year was chicken wings, taco salad, etc. They did have lettuce, peppers, and broccoli out for salad bar each night. The beer dispenser was broken every day while we were there but wine was available, as were bottled sodas. The biggest complaint we have - and why we will not go back - is because of the noise of the air conditioner. It's a wall unit from floor to ceiling in the bedroom and is so loud it makes it difficult to sleep. We really like the hotel for the value and convenience but just can't over-come this noise at night. However, we would still recommend this hotel for families and anyone who is going to be in the area for an extended time that doesn't have a problem with the air conditioning noise. The kitchen is a big plus and there is a Fry's Market very close.

I can also see that some of the rooms are very close (within several feet) of a giant billboard that is lit up at night. On the good side, the staff is friendly and helpful.

We didn't stay for the dinners, but the one my sister had was disappointing - hot dogs and hamburgers on barbeque night. Oh, well - we didn't stay for the food. The staff was very pleasant and totally accomodating. We had requested a crib that was not in our room when we checked in - I called and it arrived right away. HOusekeeping came each day unless your privacy card was on the door. After 2 days w/the card out, they stuck a note under the door just to check in on us! The pool was adequate in size, but very poorly maintained. On our second day, they closed it to \"shock\" it, but the next day the water was so cloudy you couldn't see the second step. Don't know what was happening - again, we didn't stay for the pool, so didn't really affect us. The location was very close to lots of good restaurants, shopping and Castles 'n Coasters (small amusement park).
