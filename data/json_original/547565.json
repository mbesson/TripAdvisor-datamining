The front desk staff took good care of us. The rooms were nice by our standards, the cleanliness and safety were unquestionable.The breakfast was just OK.Who goes to Florence to watch TV? Albergo Azzi gave us umberellas to keep dry on our way to the Academia.", "Date": "Apr 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR819436035", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SteveinOhio"}, {"Content": "Truly horrible! After reading some positive reviews, my girlfriend and i made the mistake of staying at the Azzi. Our bathroom (and thus our room) smelt like a SEWER the whole time, the TV didnt work, we were not allowed to use the air conditioner because it wasnt summer, there is NO turkish bath (per their website) and worst of all the staff we're unfriendly and only cared they got paid. I would highly recommend not staying there!", "Date": "Apr 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR119051041", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Independent_tourist"}, {"Content": "A roomy haven Close to the railway station and a few short minutes to the cathedral and market. We had a spacious clean well furnished ground floor room which was a bonus after hauling our cases for days over cobblestones and up stairs. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast was adequate. A library of books on Florence and art was a bonus. There is an area close by that is not good to wander in at night - bars and sad looking drinkers - but this can be avoided if one follows the map closely. Plenty of restaurants nearby too.", "Date": "Jun 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR710286852", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Inexpensive, convenient place to Stay The Hotel Azzi is located in the Old town of Firenze, within walking distance to the Convention center and many of the major attractions in this beautiful Italian city. Very friendly and helpful folks at the Azzi. It is certainly not the Ritz Carlton, but I had a large comfortable handicapped accessible room. Breakfast was just OK (could use some improvement) but something to eat was always there. Helpful information was available for touring and most were withing walking distance.

It's truly a gem of a find in such an expensive city. Very close to the train station (less than 5 minute walk) which is very convenient when hopping from one city to the next. The rooms were lovely, lots of character, very clean! We had a very large twin room with bath - old wooden furniture and a patio off the room to allow the air in. There is a nice deck on the 1st floor to enjoy an afternoon glass of wine or morning coffee on. There is a 'bar' downstairs - which is basically a cabinet, and you can order wine/spirits from the person at the front desk. While the immediate area is nothing to write home about, it is safe and very close to all amenities and attractions. About a 5-10 minute walk to both the Duomo and Academia Gallery, about 15 minutes to the Uffizi and Ponte Vecchio. The staff are some of the most helpful I've ever met. Carlo has the best restaurant recommendations and never led us astray in our three nights. Jiullietta recommended a wine tour in the Tuscan hills which was wonderful.", "Date": "Jul 12, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR239490004", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Canadian in London"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d547565-r14893349-Albergo_Azzi-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "547565", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
