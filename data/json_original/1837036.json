Bathroom was exceptional with a ceiling shower head and big tub. There was a TV in the bathroom mirror, which made us laugh at such indulgences. We traveled as a family of four with two children, 4 & 8 year old boys. The kids had a good time at the pool. The staff was welcoming, pleasant and courteous. The boys thoroughly enjoyed the nightly 6pm Koi feeding event in the lobby. Although we did not leave our kids for babysitting services, we did visit the Kid's club for a couple of Wii games, table hockey, ping pong and outdoor basketall court during the short tropical showers. The staff there also seemed also very responsible and accomodating. We booked an oceanfront room which was nice although a little farther from the main lobby. You can take a quicker shortcut by walking along the beach area to your room. The beach was fairly rocky with a lot of debris. It was pretty desolate, as most guests enjoyed the pools. If you walk further down the beach, you may be lucky enough to find a few sand dollars. Bicycles were available at the boat house with additional activites to go fishing (although the fish were too smart to bite), There is also duck, turtle, fish feeding at the convention center where they sell the private residences. Receptionist is very kind to provide a big bowl of fish food for the kids to throw at feed at the pleasure. All in all, the hotel is very nice and you will not be disappointed in the rooms. The one thing in general at Puerto Rico, seems a lack of selection with salads and vegetables. We craved these staples and tried to eat local often, although they don't seem to be local staples as a lot of things are fried. I would recommend renting a car to travel as the roads are easy to drive and parking is about 23 dollars a day at the hotel. It was convenient to get visit the supermarkets, go out for dinner at the Kiosks, (La Parilla was always recommended) and the food was tasty. Having a car also made it easier to visit El Yunque rain forest and visit at your pace, long trail but my four year old made it all the way to the falls. Wear swimsuits as you will want to take a dip. You should not be disappointed as I agree that the grounds are beautiful and the staff are friendly and accomodating. We also had a late flight and were able to spend the day at the resort with a late shower at the golf house.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Property\u201d", "Author": "Elizabeth201", "ReviewID": "UR128431337", "Content": "The property is beautiful! The restaurants have great service and delicious food! Even our room at the low end of the scale was very nicely appointed. The golf course is very nice and well maintained. We also made use of the non-motorized water sports which were fun but did not give you a very large space to explore (interior lagoon) but it was very safe for the kids. The downside is that having only 2 restaurants (plus an extra for lunch) is very limiting for a one week stay (not to mention the high prices) so we had to go in search of local restaurants. We rented a car and did not like that they did not offer self parking (though there was plenty of space) and charged $20-25/night for valet. Several times we called the valet before leaving the room and the car was not ready when we arrived.

All in all it was a really good time. This was our second trip to Bahia; my wife and I liked it so much last fall that we returned wtih the kids for their spring break. As many travelers have noted, the grounds are absolutely beautiful. The beach was great. We did all the nearby adventures including hiking in the rainforest, surfing lessons for the whole family, kayaking at biobay, deep sea fishing, exploring Old San Juan and ziplining. And we still had plenty of time to lounge by the beach and pool. All were fun (though I wouldn't recommend the fishing boat suggested by the concierge). Prices for food and drink were generally about what you would expect to pay at a good restaurant--not cheap. But for anyone who travels much, they are in line with expectations. And notwithstanding a couple of reviews I've seen to the contrary, the food at all three restaurants on site was excellent. We particularly liked breakfast at the Fern restaurant (kids loved the French Toast) and dinners at Fern and Molasses were really great. And throughout the resort, the staff could not have been nicer and more accommodating. They vary in experience, but all seemed genuinely motivated to make our stay pleasant. We had a couple of minor annoyances, but they were resolved to our satisfaction by management.

We have stayed at St. Regis properties in other locations, so we know their standards and that is precisely what we hoped for during our stay in Bahia. Let me start with the inconviniences, so that I may leave the best for last! First of all, there was no hot water in part of our beautiful bathroom. The shower and faucets only had lukewarm water (room 922) and the only way you could get really hot water was in the bathtub. It was overcast and cool and I missed the hot water! It is very difficult to wash your hair in the bathtub( no manual shower), so that was not an option. Also, one of the bathrobes provided had a HUGE brown stain in the front.....Next we went to our beautiful and cozy bedroom terrace and while having a nice conversation, realized there were some \"creatures\" moving across the floor which turned out to be small roaches. Needless to say, we reported all these inconviniences to the front desk and they were very attentive and apologetic. By the time we got back to our room that evening the robe had been replaced, the little creatures gone but the hot water problem was not solved. The hotel management provided some unexpected and greatly appreciated complimentary benefits but I still wished they had given me HOT water. The second big disappointment was the dinning arrangements. We always make reservations well in advance because we do not like to wait for a long time when we go out to dinner. On our second evening, when we promptly arrived at the Molasses Rest, we were informed that there was a back up because they were the only rest available that night since Fern was hosting a private affair and the rainy, windy weather did not allow the outside tables at Molasses to be available. We were then informed we could wait for an hour or order \"take out\" Trying not to ruin an otherwise wonderful day we proceeded to wait and luckily were taken to our table before the estimated time.The staff tried very hard to take care of all the unhappy dinners and were very professional in their approach but a property like this should have in place a plan for rainy and windy weather which is not uncommon in our tropical island.(we are locals and we know the weather) The fact that the second rest was not available did not help the situation. Maybe they need to reconsider if they can handle groups without affecting the individual guests! Having said all that, the good news! The hotel grounds are BEAUTIFUL! The rooms are large, cozy and in good taste. The pool area is large and designed to provide various small areas to swim and lounge.We were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and on two ocassions the staff surprised us with some complimentary sparkling wine! Very thoughtful !The staff at all levels are extremely professional and will go out of their way to accomodate to your needs and request. Customer service is outstanding! The food at both restaurants is excellent. Following the bartender's advice we ordere the octopus appetizer at Ferns and it was incredible, a MUST try if you like spicy and savory dishes. If you want to get away from it all, relax and be pampered, this is a great choice. I just hope management takes note and solve the mentioned inconveniences so that the hotel can really shine as the beautiful and first class proerty that it is meant to be.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Stay; Do not pay attention to negative reviews\u201d", "Author": "stefhef", "ReviewID": "UR127986710", "Content": "We stayed here for 6 days at the end of March. The resort, as others have written, is BEAUTIFUL. Very lush, tropical. Relaxed setting. It is an oasis. You can stay here the whole time or venture out. We rented a car and ventured out several nights. First, the rooms are great - we had a Deluxe, which is a large bedroom, a nice size foyer with wet bar and SUBZERO undercounter refrigerator, small walk in closet and huge bathroom with a great shower that is about 8 x 8 feet. We played the golf course and it is one of the nicest ever - just beautiful and very challenging. You get a discount as a St. Regis guest but it is still pricey. But it's not crowded and you feel like you have it to yourself. Note that the driving range is included with your daily resort charge. The gym was very nice - we went every day. The pools are beautiful. The beach is very nice too - a beautiful horseshoe shape and very private. It is true that they water is more of a green color, not Caribbean blue, so if that will bother you then this is not the place for you. The service at the pool was excellent. But for even better food, take a break and go over and grab lunch at the bar in the lobby (or at tables just outside the lobby) and you can be fed by Jean Georges' Fern restaurant. Great bar food. The service here was terrific. For example, on our last day, they came and picked us up at in the golf cart and we sat in the lobby until it was time to leave (it was pouring rain). I asked the valet to watch our luggage for us as we would be leaving in an hour and also asked him to retrieive our golf club travel bags at the pro shop. He came in later to the lobby and told me that everything had been taken care of. When we went out side and they brought around our car, the valet had loaded our luggage into our car already AND had retrieved the golf bags at the pro shop (about a half a mile away) and loaded our clubs into the travel bags. We literally got in the car and left. Now that is how it should be. The staff is VERY accomodating. Our butler offered to go to the store and buy us whatever we needed (otherwise we didn't see much of him, but we weren't really looking for him). There is a store about 10 minutes away by car, Ralph's, where you can stock up on cheese, snacks, wine, etc. which you can keep in your Subzero refrigerator and have breakfast or an after pool treat/happy hour in your room or on your patio. I highly recommend this. We ate at Fern for dinner and breakfast. The food is excellent, but yes, the service is terribly slow. But then again, where are we going? The other restaurant, Molasses, is just ok and definitely a lot of money for what it is. The food at the pool is very good, especially the Thai salad, but it is pricey (well, like every other high end hotel). We ate at the Kiosks twice and really enjoyed them. La Parilla and Vegigantes. We liked the food at Vegigantes better (and it was cleaner) but the atmosphere is better at LaParilla. The kiosks look grungy but if you go to the more recommended ones, you will be fine. The St. Regis would not recommend any of them because \"they don't meet the level of St. Regis service\". Well, if you like to go local, definitely go there. We also ate in Old San Juan at Marmalade, which was great (and St. Regis \"approved\"). Now, if you want to nitpick, yes there are things that could be improved upon. Isn't that true everywhere? Once there were no water bottles in the gym but when I informed them, they quickly supplied them, including at everyone's machine. Yes, the chairs at the beach are not the best, but they are fine (the ones at the pool are more luxurious). Yes, the service at Fern is slow, but where are you going anyway? Yes, the housekeepers seem to come at all different hours but they eventually do the job (although I am not sure how often they vacuum, but the beds are made and the bathroom is spotlessly clean). Sometimes I had to call for turn down service but they always come willingly and asked me if there was anything else they could do for me. So, like any vacation, it is what you make of it. You can go here and have a wonderful time. But do note the green water, the distance to Old San Juan (about 45 minutes, you need a car as the taxis are very expensive), and the lack of much outside of the hotel resort. We went to another golf course one day (the Rio Mar), and it was pretty bad. Is the St. Regis worthy of Category 7? That is probably a bit much but it is a 6. Also, note that there are lots of couples here, as well as lots of young families but I have to say that the children were VERY well behaved. In any event, we are rather particular travellers (5 stars or better) and this property is a fine place to stay.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cIt costs to be treated like a boss!\u201d", "Author": "FoolinLove2012", "ReviewID": "UR127983739", "Content": "Hi, I stayed at St. Regis for one night as part of my 8 day honeymoon to Puerto Rico and Vieques. I choose St. Regis for our grand finale and go all out and spare no expense! The W was another option but after researching it is overpriced and poor quality (also I went there for a day see that review.) Prior to arrival I made my reservations using my Starwood points and worked extensively with the concierge to make special requests. The service and care I received from Jossell and Luisa were impeccable. They arranged for my husband and me to be picked up in a Panamera Porsche with 2003 vintage Moet & Chandon on ice in it, per my request. The driver was extremely nice and told us \"St. Regis will get your luggage and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about anything, just walk in and they will take care of the rest.\" We were welcomed and addressed by my new married name as soon as we stepped out of the car. We were given their signature drink and had a quick personal check in were you sit at an office table. Very private and felt like celebrities! We were introduced to our butler Luis and he was by far the most hospitable, humble, respectful, and sincere person I have met in the service industry (I have worked in the service industry and travel a lot so I know good talent.) Luis deserves a raise! We rented a poolside cabana and he asked if we wanted to go there or our room first. He whisked us away in a golf cart to our room. When we arrived our bags were already inside, with our champagne on ice with fresh glasses, rose petals from the door to the bed, complimentary chocolate covered strawberries, an a hand written thank you and welcome card from the general manager Anthony. Anthony gave us his personal congrats on our wedding. Luis gave us a tour of our room and it was spotless! It had a bar, living room, patio, two bathrooms, whirlpool tub, tv in the mirror, master bedroom leading to another patio area ....I mean it was luxury!! Luis escorted us to our cabana were we had a waitress waiting and brought us our favorite drinks as soon as we arrived without ordering them (this was part of my special requests.) We ate sushi from Seagrapes which was average and took a dip in the pool and hot tub. Luis confirmed our dinner reservations and spa reservations at Remede. We walked around the grounds and it looks like a tropical rainforest. The beach is okay but the golf course makes up for it. We went to Remede spa for a massage. Remede spa is five stars! I also went to the W Away Spa in Vieques and it was mall quality. Remede used aroma therapy and had delicious treats afterwards to help reenergize, whirlpool, showers, and private dressing rooms. They had a separate area for men and women it was exquisite. Definitely go there! We had 9:30pm dinner reservations at Fern and Luis left us a note informing us he would be at our room at 9:15pm to pick us up. He also left a menu for us to choose our private dining am breakfast because we were leaving at 6:30am. Fern was nice but we felt rushed to order. The menu was limited and I was hoping for more. However, the meal was outstanding. We had the chicken. When we returned to our room we found Luis had run a bubble bath for us and cleaned the room! He was so nice he even turned down a tip (we tipped him every time we saw him.) He was like,\"No this is my service to you.\" Amazing! Now, the downside. We had put in a special request for breakfast and they got the order wrong and they didn't have our cab on time. Besides that this place is the best resort in Puerto Rico! Jimmy Fallon, Dwayne Wade, and tons of other celebrities stay there. In Vieques we met a couple that golfed with Oscar de la Hoya who owns a house at St. Regis. There were no bedbugs so don't worry about that. Overall, I had a five star experience and if they didn't mess my breakfast up I would have given them five stars. However, I worked with the concierge and spent 3k for one night there so my experience might be skewed from others just on a normal stay. Even if we didn't receive \"presidential\" treatment the place is still lovely. Bring plenty of cash because you should tip a lot and often. Will post all of the pics. The St. Regis is the best! If you want to be treated like a boss you have to pay. St. Regis is not for people on a budget. Will definitely return and recommend to others.

Once you are here you will never want to leave. There are so many activities to choose from (cycling , nature tours, canoeing, fishing, sailing, tennis, golf etc). The property is huge I think about 500 acres all covered with exotic trees, gorgeous landscapes, lakes and bike trails. Not to mention the beautiful pools and private cabanas covered with white drapes. They also have their own nursery garden which is huge (sign up for the eco-tour)! Near the boat house you have a gorgeous view of the El Yunque rainforest. Everything is absolutely perfect. It feels like you are in a middle of a rainforest which obviously means mosquitoes! So make sure you bring insect repellent. We were here for 4 days and stayed in the luxurious Astor Suite which comes with butler service. The butler gave us the entire tour of our suite. The suites are very large ( living room , bedroom , very large terrace, and wet bar ) . There is a pull-out sofa bed in the living room , very impressive furniture (all wood), 2 bathrooms (marbled- there is even a hidden TV in your mirror which was pretty cool) and lots of storage space(walk in closets, dressers) . The butler service covers the usual , packing, unpacking, pressing and tea/coffee service..always available whenever needed. I also tried the Explorer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relief spa treatment which was great. The only thing I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like was occasionally I would find creepy little creatures crawling on the floor (I have a phobia of crawling insects so I would panic) but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there is anything that can be done about that. There are so many trees around so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost impossible to get rid of every insect. Beds are also very comfortable but the singing of Puerto Rican Coqui can get really annoying.

I am embarrassed to say this was actually my second stay. While I could go on about the beauty of the design, the grounds, and the golf course. Here is a list of a few of the mishaps I encountered during my unfortunate second stay. 1. The rooms have a musty odor! Be prepared should you have asthma, there is definitely mold. 2. Housekeeping does not exist. Do not expect for them to even clean your room. We stayed here for five nights and our room was cleaned two times. It was very inconsistent as well, trash not taken out of trash can, mirror not wiped, amenities not replaced, and many other detailed items. Piles of dirty towels were stacked outside our room on the foyer for 8 hours one day, oh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6PS. My room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get cleaned that day either. 3. The one highlight in my first stay was the spa (about 1 year ago), this visit I was totally not impressed, and it has lost its sophistication, charm, and cleanliness. The male manager was very loud and obnoxious- I felt terrible for the female employee he was talking to, it was very demeaning- get a new manager! Also- a very dirty area of the hotel. I actually paid the erroneous prices that they were charging and the massage was just ok...It was not advertised properly- I was told I would have paraffin and did not get this service! 4. Mold and bird poop stains ravage this place- don't plan on enjoying sitting on anything outside that has a cushion- it is GROSS! Walls are covered in dirt and mold, when it rains everything is slippery and I fell twice. 5. The food prices are ridiculous, and totally not worth what they are charging! I was horrified to find a hair in my salad at Molasses. Services was horrible and I mean horrible at Fern... and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me started on In Room Dining. Hours of waiting\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 6. Take you bug spray, and plan to get eaten alive. 7. Wear your shoes at all times! There is trash everywhere, no one cleans the grounds. 8. Don't expect service- all we found were employees texting and having private conversations (specifically in the front of the hotel the bell boys were upset about their pay and health benefits), now I have stayed all over the world with Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton and let me tell you, I have never experienced these prices coupled with such poor service. Also, there is a lack of attention to detail- water spots on glasses, water spots on flatwear, stains on walls, wobbly tables, not getting correct order, food cold, listen I could go on for days! 9. The fitness machines were broken. 10. The cabanas by the pool were dirty, and cost $300/day!?! No chairs were available for seating; when I said something to the waitress, she told us to come back in two hours and that this is normal, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry. WOW! 11. When we checked in there were STAINS on the sheets on my bed, ashes and bird poop on the balcony, and we had to wait 3 hours for our room to be ready. Seriously, don't stay here. St Regis- I will NEVER come back to visit one of your hotels, nor will I return to Puerto Rico! Whoever your hotel manager is should be ashamed that is what they are calling luxury.

Overall, we enjoyed it, but given comments regarding beach / ocean below and relative cost, would not return. Pros: - The staff are excellent. Everyone of them seemed to be very focussed on making guests feel welcome and happy. Nevertheless, dining service (particularly breakfast) was slow at peak hours. We found that getting a free cup of coffee in the lounge was an effective way to make the wait for a table and cup of coffee at breakfast manageable. - Rooms are very clean and attractive. We had two rooms on the third floor of Building 7--would definitely recommend third (top) floor for privacy and some elevation above the ground level humidity. They had comfortable and private balconies. - Food was good, though Molasses was out of two of the somewhat limited selection of red wines on their list. Fern, the fancier restaurant, was quite good, though filled with loud children even after 8 / 9 PM. (This is not the hotel's fault, of course, but was unfortunate). Query whether kids meal policy is a factor, though? If kids had to pay at Fern (rather the eat \"free\" as part of meal plan), my guess is that ferm would quickly become an adult restaurant. Cons: - The beach is an utter disappointment. The water is rough and there are no lifeguards, which means swimming in the ocean is basically out of the question--at least during March; perhaps it is calmer in other months. This really detracts from the value of the property: There is a \"two mile\" beach but its effectively unutilized because the water is unsafe. One consequence seems to be that the pool is overcrowded. Even if it weren't however, what is the point of going to a beach resort if one can only wade in the water up to their waist without fearing for their safety? - Because there are no beach activities (sailing, paddleboarding, etc.), watersports are conducted at what is effectively a murky pond safely inland from the ocean. - Housekeeping service was, all things considered, poor; little things really but they sour the mood at a hotel holding itself out as exceptional: (1) staff checked our minibar everyday and itemized the consumed items but only replaced them when I happened to intercept them and ask for replacements. (2) We used the two bottles of mouthwash in bathroom over first few days of our visit and they were never replaced. Then we used the two in our kids' room and they were never replaced. Same for soap and other toiletries. These items should be replaced every day at a hotel charging $1K+ per night. (3) One day the toilet paper in our bathroom ran out. Again, somewhat trivial but its never happened to me in even an economy hotel before. - Tennis courts / Molasses restaurant are far away from main building, though staff is pretty good about providing golf cart transportation.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the $\u201d", "Author": "E O", "ReviewID": "UR127098253", "Content": "We recently stayed at the St. Regis Bahia Beach for a week with our two young boys. Although there are many wonderful aspects to this property, I would not return again -- at least not at these prices. I have to confess that the weather was pretty terrible while we were there (rained a lot), but I think I can still be objective. Pros: Beautiful 1-br suite facing the ocean; huge master bathroom with deep soaking tub and rainfall shower; (mostly) friendly service; Fern (main restaurant) was superb (especially the tasting menu); absolutely gorgeous, meticulously maintained grounds, beautiful pool, children's club (which we only used once); lots of families (so we felt comfortable being there with our 2 boys); very private beach (no other resorts nearby); the spa is incredible -- get there early and spend some time in the waiting area, which is breathtaking -- and the prices are not out of line. Cons: expensive (we were not using points); butler service is silly -- I never met the \"butler\"; hotel is pretty isolated so there aren't a lot of options for eating out; Molasses, the restaurant at the golf club, is only so-so; ocean is not the calm, aquamarine water you might be used to in the Caribbean -- it actually looked brown for much of our trip (tho this may have been due to the weather); pool got very crowded and we were unable to get seats one morning (towel people told us to come back in 2 hours! Fortunately it did not take that long) -- meanwhile the cabana chairs went unused b/c barely anyone was willing to shell out $300 for the cabanas; beach \"beds\" were $300/day -- ridiculous!!!; there was definitely a lot of \"nickle and diming\"-- for instance, I asked for some steamed broccoli to come with my son's room service order. The charge was $9! They sold diapers in the gift shop -- individually wrapped for $3 each -- don't plan to buy diapers there. Also, our first-floor suite seemed fine when we arrived, but by the end of the week it had a distinct musty odor -- I think they have a humidity problem. All of our clothes, the sheets on the bed, even our passports were limp by the end of the week. Overall, I was disappointed in the place. We've also recently been to Little Dix Bay in Virgin Gorda and Carlisle Bay in Antigua. I liked both places much better. The St. Regis is just, well, too... corporate. You just don't get a beachy, relaxed vibe there. I guess I just prefer a more casual vacation, so maybe the St. Regis was the wrong place. I really disliked the main building, which was frigidly cold. I like resorts where the reception is open-air. Also, the place lacked a community room/library. Most beach resorts I've been to have some kind of library where you can leave a book and take a book. It's not a big deal, but this sort of thing makes it feel more personal. The lobby/bar at the St. Regis was filled with coffee table books that seemed to have been selected by someone at corporate headquarters.

Wonderful. Unbelievably beautiful ... this is the resort that all other resorts are jealous of. Without a doubt, the best resort/hotel we've ever stayed at. Our stay was almost entirely paid for by SPG points (had one night of cash+points) and thank goodness for that. It's expensive, absurdly so. But if you can stomach the cost, you'll be rewarded with an utterly amazing stay. Upon our arrival, we were upgraded for free to a \"Luxury Suite,\" a nearly 1000 sq. ft. suite that made us feel like millionaires. Ocean view, gigantic living room & bedroom, two full bathrooms, massive porch that spanned both rooms and overlooked the ocean. Simply breathtaking. Everything felt brand new and 110% maintained. We had (delivered and complimentary) french press coffee each morning on our balcony while enjoying the sunrise and ocean breeze. The best part were the grounds themselves ... wooden pathways winding through a rain forest while you walk to/from your room. I've heard some people talk on other forums about it being too far to walk around and that's simply ridiculous - this is a vacation destination, why are you in such a hurry? We stayed in the building furthest from the main office and it took mayyybe 7 minutes to get from one place to the other. And that's walking super-slow so we could enjoy the beautiful scenery and listen to the coqu\u00c3\u00ad (tiny frogs). If you don't like walking a few minutes in the ultra-safe and calming rain forest, either (1) don't stay here, or (2) have the butlers drive you around in the golf carts. We were amazed at how secluded everything felt despite full occupancy ... they really succeed at making us feel like we were special and appreciated.

From our exemplary service in Princville we had grand hopes for our return to St Regis puerto rico style! Upon arrival the setting was nice but once we hit the pool the troubles began. No seats except the ones by the cabanas and when we sat down we were rudely snapped at that it was not allowed, come back in two hours! From there the extremely overpriced and extremely slow service and extremely poor quality food on resort from fern to sea grapes to molasses. Nothing was good and i am not exaggerating. We had toilets plugged and overflow (45minutes to have plunged out and 1.5hrs for housekeeping to clean), diary served to my dairy allergic daughter daily (despite our account being marked non dairy .... and her allergy isn't lactose intolerance), 1hr 40 minutes for luke warm room service that was more expensive than eating at a five star restaurant in new york, we were told we couldnt have more towels at the pool after rain soaked the ones we had and when he begrudgingly gave us two towels for four people we were told not to get them wet?, we had our robes removed from the room, my camera taken in the bed sheets (returned) no shower supplies restocked, no toilet paper restocked, never enough towels, and we were told our coffee could not be delivered as the butlers had all the french presses (despite having a standing daily order for same). As i right this we have called twice for room cleaning and after 2 !/2 hours they showed up. EVERYTHING HERE COMES WITH HORRIBLE SERVICE. As you can imagine after all this i finally complained and what did they do.... they sent milk and cookies to my dairy allergic daughter! Not such a big deal unless you have a non dairy allergic son eagerly gulping them down in front of her. If they didnt have so much of my money ( as i prepayed for 90% of the trip) i would have checked out and gone elsewhere. Instead we choose to leave this hotel every chance we could. The resort executive emailed me after i emailed the St regis. He wants to personally apologize for our trouble. I responded no thank you as all ive heard from the staff here is we are so sorry for your trouble. I and my family travel a lot, just never again to the St. Regis bahia beech or any st regis for that matter!

You had to put down towels on chairs by 7:30 am to reserve a seat. Even then, your seat was in the midst of many, many noisy children. Not that relaxing. If you don't get a seat by the pool, you can sit by the ocean, but the chairs are less comfortable and most people don't actually swim in the ocean here. This is for a few reasons, the beach sand and ocean floor are not great. The water is cloudy and full of seaweed and the waves are strong with an undertow. So pool seating is preferable, but harder to get. At one point two pool chairs opened up and I went to sit down, but the pool attendant told me she was reserving these chairs for someone. I came by an hour later, no one had ever sat there and a different attendant was removing the towels the first attendant had put there. I asked him if I could sit there and he said sure. I told him that the other attendant told me that she was saving them for someone. He said that's not allowed! I guess someone should let everyone know that this is the rule. In addition to the difficulty of getting seats by the pool, the seats are all lined up together and it is hard to position your chair if you want shade or sun, the chair basically stays put. You are right on top of your neighbors. Pool food service is pretty slow, but the food (from Seagrapes) is good. The pools are pretty, warm, and nicely landscaped. Occasionally the iguanas will go for a swim, but they are harmless. The bathrooms by the pool were always dirty and wet. It didn't seem like any one was taking care of it. Room- We had a third floor garden view room in building six. This is close to the Plantation House, the pool, the spa, the fitness center and Seagrapes. It is far from the convention center, Molasses and the Boat House. I thought the location was perfect for our needs. The room is beautiful It is spacious and well appointed. The bathrooms are large. The only real negative with the rooms is that it is hard to adjust the temperature of the shower. It was either burning hot or freezing cold. Otherwise the beds are comfortable and the technology is good. Spa- The spa is lovely. I had a massage and facial. They were average in quality, but a bit on the expensive side. Fitness center- The fitness center has 3 ellipticals, 4 treadmills (one broken), and a few other cardio machines, bicycles and weight machines. It has towels and water bottles and an exercise room. It is very nice. Food- The food is well above average. Fern is extremely good and Seagrapes is excellent for a poolside restaurant. The food and room were the two best features of this hotel. Activities/location- There are no water sports at all. You have to go elsewhere for that. We took a sailboat excursion, but the marina is a good 45 minute drive from the hotel. The hotel seems far from most activities and 45 minutes from Old San Juan. On the premises is a boathouse, but we were told since it was so crowded that it would be hard to get kayaks or bicycles. We took the nature walk and it was nice. Butler service- We were supposed to have butler service, but every morning when I called down for coffee, they told me I didn't have butler service. When I asked them to check, they came back and said oh you do have butler service, what would you like. The coffee came very quickly and was very good. Fern's restaurant- We had a reservation for 8 pm on the first night of our arrival at the hotel. It was the only time available on Opentable. We were starving and called over and asked if we could come earlier and they told us we couldn't. When we arrived at 8 pm, the place was empty. I don't know why we couldn't come earlier. Then for breakfasts each morning, we requested outdoor seating. Each day they said no, despite the fact that there were many empty tables outdoors. I just don't understand this approach to customer service at all. Would we return?- I would have to say probably not. The pool is too crowded, the beach is not inviting and there are no activities nearby. It feels like a pretty and new hotel in the middle of nowhere. There is a ton of construction going on around the property. They are continually building more and more condo units all over the place. I don't know if the condo owners use the hotels facilities, but if they do, it will be even more crowded.

My only request to management would be to keep Seagrapes open every night for dinner or to open Molasses or Fern an hour early so there is a place to go for dinner starting at 5.

We stayed at this property for 4 days and 3 nights as our last vacation before our 2nd child arrived. My husband, son (4 years old) and I LOVED this resort. We felt truly pampered and not over crowded. We stayed in room 414 (or 416?) I believe ----- it was the ground floor room right next to the plantation house. We enjoyed our private deck and very short walk to the beach. Upon arrival our room wasn't ready, which was fine. The employees took our luggage and promised to have it at the room after we finished lunch by the pool. Highly recommend the restaurant by the pool - it had a great breeze, was the most reasonably priced, and good selection of food for kids. Speaking of kids make sure you use the kid meal pass. As a pregnant woman it was nice to have him order a ton of food and when I finished mine I could eat his too :) Our room was amazing - very large and spacious and more than enough room for the 3 of us. During our stay we went bike riding almost every day and spent all of our outdoor time at the beach. The pool looked amazing, but being from Atlanta we came to experience the beach not the pool. The water was a little choppy but none of us were doing any major swimming so it didn't bother us one bit. We tried Molasses which was ok - we went one night but didn't return back and I wouldn't recommend it. I would recommend Fern for breakfast --- it was amazing! We loved the french toast and fresh smoothies and any breakfast item I wanted which was made to order. Also I noticed the dress code was relaxed for breakfast, but did noticed that people were more dressed up for dinner. We also ordered food at the bar at night for dinner and ate on our patio. The first time we did this we were told there was no kid's menu, but the subsequent nights we were given a kid's menu so make sure push for one. We actually never left the resort as this vacation was all about eating and relaxing and slowing down and it was perfect for that. The resort definitely has enough space to wander and walk, but they also provide golf carts for easy transportation around the property.

I have stayed at a St Regis in Atlanta and thought I kew, within reason, What to expect. The St Regis is a luxury brand that is really well appointed, in the cases I have seen at least. I saw the pictures and the ratings people gave it and was actually on the fence as to whether to book it or not. I can be somewhat of a risk taker and felt a little nervous about statying here. I shouldn't have been so concerned. I do like the finer things in life to a certain degree. Namely the food and atmosphere are what I am typically drawn to in a resort. With the furnishings and designed experience coming together as well as it did i was pleasantly surprised. Some of other reviews I read about the propperty have described it as \"too far out, from town\". really? There is a Ralph's not 10 minutes away ( I have never seen one of those in the countryside, anywhere! ). Also too far from San Juan! We coud be in San Juan in 40 minutes without any major traffic. \"over priced and over-rated\" was another reivew. I am not wealthy but i do splurge on travel sometimes so keep that in mind with this review. The place was a little pricey but if your not a \"big drinker and don't care for the all inclusive get as full as you can and drink as much as you can, to get your prepaid money's worth then maybe this is the place for you. I was looking for a great family vacation spot that would be something my children would remember and look back on with a smile. My wife and I had some of the best food i have eaten outside continental US. First the Best meal I had was at Fern, above the lobby restaurant ( Jean George's, whom I had never heard of prior to this trip ). Appetizer: Avocado Pizza: Exceptionally good and Steamed Shrimp Salad very tasty and sweet, Main Course: Roasted Grouper with Black beans ( best fish I have ever eaten ) and Parmesan encrusted chicken ( My oh My was that good too ), Dessert: Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Ice Cream ( wanted to lick the plate when my wife turned her head, but i didn't! ). Molasses was the next restaurant ( Puerto Rican Food at the Golf Clubhouse, I had never had Mofongo before, wow! ) Appetizer: Pork Belly ( enough said, it was great ),The Mofongo: ( Plantains and Beef with Creola sauce ) was beef roast and \"potato like\" flavor on steroids. So full i didn't order a dessert. Seagrapes was the poolside bar/restauranta that you generally eat lunch at. We did so every day at the pool and were never dissapointed. The sweet potato fries were the whole family favorite. I can honestly say that the food was not a let down at any of the meals we ate there. The food is not cheap! But the food is exceptionally prepared and well thought out, not fru fru but nicely presented and prepared. The sushi appetizers, Pizza & Egg Rolls at the pool were really good. The most important ( next to food ) element in \"my\" good vacation is people and how they treat you while in their hometown. The people we encountered at the property and off were amazingly helpful, courteous and giving. A few to mention at the resort were Efram at the lobby as a fantastic front man with a easy smile for all people, Dalesse at Seagrapes was very helpful as was Clarrissa, Ettiene at Fern was always on the spot with anything you needed and very easy to talk to. Off property the best things were the Old San Juan tour and especially the Segway tour to El Morro. Miguel was great but his partner needs some rough edges polished. The segway was so easy to get the hang of and fun too. I was shocked we could jump on it after a 5 minute lesson and ride it for several miles. it was really fun to learn that and all the history of Old San Juan. We ate at La Bombonera in Old San Juan. Red beans and Rice, Mallorca was excellent ( Bacon, Egg and Cheeeeeeeeese on Mallorca bread ) really good if you like a cheese toasty sandwhich with Egg and bacon. We will be back to San Juan and St Regis at Bahia Beach. Best trip with the family i have had. The Price point is a higher than typical and so was the delivered product.

There were many complaints last year about this hotel not meeting a 5 star St Regis standard and it is only getting worse. We are not snobs, but we are used to staying in luxury hotels. When you are charging top of the line prices for the rooms, food & drinks plus a $60 a day resort fee things like free coffee, having your clothing pressed and a glass of Champagne upon arrival should be STANDARD!!! This is not asking much! We were there on points like most of the guests in the hotel and I think this is truly the problem. Even though we are well earning our hotel stay with our spending power you get the feeling that the management looks at it like you are staying for free. They need to become consistent with what they offer and not nickle and dime you over a cup of coffee and pressing your clothes. It left me with a less than luxury feeling this time and with a new property opening for the Ritz this year in Puerto Rico I feel like they should step up their game and become a true luxury property! As a Business owner I know that it is the little things that make a guest feel special and continue to be a repeat customer.

Here are the pros: 1) great service, 2) amazing guest room, 3) lush well maintained property, 4) excellent food. Cons: 1) a long drive from San Juan (but is secluded and private), 2) beach does not compare to other beaches in the caribbean (i.e. St. John, St. Croix, BVI), 3) very expensive (we used points for one of the nights). I have been fortunate to have stayed at other high end properties like the Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons and the St. Regis does compete with said hotels, however we could have stayed at the Ritz Carlton in San Juan for less money (However, Ritz Carlton not as secluded). Personally, I had to give the St. Regis a rather than a 5 because they did nothing for my wife and I upon arrival for our honeymoon. It wasn't until I pointed this out the following day that they arranged for a bottle of wine and a bubble bath. When you pay as much as you do for such a resort you have high expectations and even higher expectations when it is a special occasion. They fell flat on their face in this regard.

Review from last year still valid. Nothing has changed (good in some respects, not so good in others). 1. Transportation. Do not rely on the resort to get you anywhere. My husband was stranded at the nearby Trump golf course for over 2 hours (and remember the Concierge never answers the phone so you are a bit helpless). Go to TOURSANJUAN.com. Francisco takes care of all your transportation needs, to and from the airport, golf trips, tours etc. He shows up, always on time, in a beautiful, clean vehicle and he is a wonderful source of info about Puerto Rico. As posted at the airport, a cab to the resort is at least 65$, so Francisco is well worth the few extra dollars. He confirms your reservations and has a nice website too. 2. The Concierge desk. Check in is always a crap shoot. There are only 2 people manning the station and there always seems to be a crowd hovering, they clearly need to hire more staff. The phone is never answered (which I guess is a good thing because when I finally have the full attention of the Concierge, I don't want her taking a phone call to help someone else). Although the Concierge staff is very nice, they are clearly overwhelmed. 3. Confirmations. You will receive a nice email greeting after you make your reservation which asks what reservations (dinner, tee times etc) you would like to make and any special requests. You can email or fax your requests but you will never hear back so save yourself the headache and just make the reservations yourself. Call the pro shop and make your own tee times. Go to Open Table and make your own dinner reservations. Things go much more smoothly if you just take care of it yourself. I know, not what you expect from a luxurious resort but it is what it is and based on the comments, the St. Regis HAS to be aware of their shortcomings but does not care, they do not change a thing. 4. Butlers? What butlers? Still waiting for our butler from our April 2011 visit to introduce himself. Forget about it. 5. The rooms. Housekeeping is incredible. Rooms are amazingly clean and well appointed. Turn down service is always done at the perfect time. The bathrooms are amazing and all the little nice touches you would expect at this price are there. 6. Restaurants. Food is very good. If someone is going to complain or comment about the price, they have not done their homework. Typical resort prices (that does not mean that I think a medium size bottle of Fiji water at the pool should be 10$). Both Molasses and Fern serve great food and the service is always excellent. As it is at the pool restaurant. All of the food staff are so nice, helpful and genuinely concerned with making you happy. Even when they are being treated rudely by guests who clearly do not how to smile or thank you. You know who you are! The breakfast bar in the lobby is a great touch. 7. Golf. Traveled with a \"real\" golfer. He played the resort course last year and was a bit turned off by the unresponsive staff and snooty attitude of the members (it is \"their\" course after all). Big change this year. Staff was great, helpful and friendly and the members were a little less chilly to resort guests. Course itself is difficult but not very interesting. He played Trump (very close by) and liked that alot more. 8. Resort grounds. Very well maintained and beautiful. Paths could be a bit more illuminated at night but no complaints. Pool area is always spotless. Lobby is warm and inviting and comfortable. Truly, a stunning resort. Those people who commented about the resort being \"away from it all\" should learn how to read a map. Did they think the resort was in the middle of San Juan? Their ignorance should not be manifested as a complaint against the resort. Do your homework! 9. Glitches. Little things that are annoying? Calling in advance to request an early check-in and waiting til an hour and a half AFTER the standard appointed check in time of 3pm to get into our room. In the resort's defense, they did upgrade our room and store our luggage after we managed to get bathing suits out. On check out day, we were begrudgingly give an extra hour and a half to check out (they figured that was fair since we had to wait that long past check in time to get into our room). But we were able to use all the facilities and showered at the spa (for a fee) so it was fine. Showers are also available for free at the golf course. So no real glitches but remember, I made all my reservations myself to avoid any problems. Overall?

The St. Regis is a stunningly beautiful resort with outstanding service and plenty of amenities. We stayed at the resort for 5 nights the week of February 13th, 2012. We booked the hotel using Starwood points and my husband also had platinum status. We rented a car at the airport and after 1 wrong turn arrived at the resort after a 45 minute drive. Upon our arrival we were greeted by several staff members and given some rum punch. We were upgraded to an ocean front suite. The suite was spotless and had a wonderful patio where we could sit and listen to the ocean. The suite was very spacious, from the 2 full baths, large foyers, walk in closet, and comfortable living area. We only used the butler service a few times but they kindly called each day to check in with us. The pool design is great as it allows for a bit of privacy. During our stay the resort was not full. There were always plenty of chairs and umbrellas available around the pool any time of day. The frozen grapes and signature tea the staff brings around throughout the day is a nice treat! The beach was beautiful and we walked quite a distance in both directions and never saw any trash along the shore. The staff was always eager to please and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and that we enjoyed our stay. I can't say enough positive things about how attentive everyone was to even the smallest details during our stay. We dined at all 3 restaurants and had enjoyable experiences. We enjoyed the tasting menu at Fern and the skirt steak mofongo at Molasses. Seagrapes had a good turkey wrap and nachos. We had wonderful massages at the spa and used the free kayak rental to check out thd lake. Off of the property we did the bio bay kayak trip, we went zip lining, hiked in the El Yunque rain forest (swam in the waterfall), and spent an afternoon/evening exploring Old San Juan. The resort was $$$, but nothing that I would consider outrageous for an island resort. Weare already planning our visit back to the St Regis next year! Pros Beautiful resort in an amazing setting!

(And that's saying something because service overall in PR can be quite lousy.) The restaurants are also lovely - a particular highlight was breakfast in the main dining room, and the mofongo at Molasses. With that said, just a few things to keep in mind when you book here. First of all, you will drop a TON of cash when you come. Even with the $25/day per kid meal plan, we were routinely dropping $50-60 just for breakfast for me and my husband. How is that even possible? However, we did book on points and so we were prepared that all these costs were just the price of the vacation. Another major disappointment for me was the lack of availability of chairs at the pool. Basically if we wanted a chair, we had to be up by about 6:30 at the latest to reserve them with towels. And most of the 'reserved' chairs sat empty for the majority of the day. Granted, we were there the week between Christmas and New Year's, but for the prices many of the guests were paying to stay, I would have expected St. Regis to come up with a better system. Frankly, they ended up losing revenue - there were many times when I would have loved to sit out by the pool with a cocktail and watched my kids swim in the pool, but there were no available chairs because they were all 'reserved' with towels. So the chairs sat empty, I stayed thirsty, and the hotel missed out on the price of an expensive cocktail. All in all, I would not hesitate to return!

The hotel is about a 30 minute drive from the San Juan airport so renting a car or hiring a car service is necessary. Be forewarned - valet parking is $45 a day and since you don't really need a car on the property, using a shuttle or car service would be much more economical. The property is very spaced out but if you are not up for walking, there are bikes to rent during the day chauffered golf carts (two of the few free things at the resort) that can take you anywhere you want to go at a moment's notice. The property is gorgeous - lush landscaping with lots of shade and a boardwalk that leads from all of the villas to the main lodge. We literally feel like we were in Jurassic Park and a dinosaur was going to pop out behind a bush at any moment. In reality, the property is swarming with lizards so we did need to watch out feet! Our room was a short walk from the main lodge and while it did not have a view at all (we looked into the trees and down to a dirt walkway towards the pool), we were very impressed with our room. It was spacious yet cozy and an extremely calming atmosphere. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a double vanity, massive soaking tub, and rain shower head. Every room has a covered patio with a loveseat/chaise and table where we would have breakfast in the mornings. We dined at both restaurants on the property during our stay. Personally, we liked Fern better than Molasses. Both were expensive but not outrageous. Since the hotel is very isolated, you had better like the menus at both restaurants if you are planning on staying for two nights! Otherwise, it is a long drive to Old San Juan or other places to eat off property. The biggest dining disappointment was Seagrapes, the restaurant at the pool. The food was overpriced (think $20 for a plate of rotten raw vegetables and dip), not good and the service was terrible. We waited over 45 minutes for our drink orders one day. The manager was understanding of our situation and did comp our food/drinks that day. Hopefully they have worked out the kinks here. The beach was disappointing but the pool was nice but very crowded. Lots of sunlight/shade options and umbrellas for almost every two chairs. Despite a lot of chair saving that seemed to be going on, we always found a place to sit that satisfied what we were looking for in terms of sun/shade/location. The pool attendants are quite eager to clean up chairs so if you are leaving your seat even for a few minutes, leave something on it so they don't get rid of your stuff! I learned that lesson the hard way... We were most surprised at the number of children at the property. It definitely isn't a kid-friendly place and there weren't really any child-focused activities. Perhaps because there are so few common areas on the property, the number of children seemed intensified. This is our second trip to Puerto Rico. Last time we stayed at the W Vieques (also a Starwood Property). If we are to return to Puerto Rico, we would definitely choose the W Vieques over the St. Regis Bahia Beach.

The rooms are beautifully appointed and having the lounge on the verandah was a nice place to sit and look at the gardens before heading off to dinner. It might not be a true reflection on how the majority of Puerto Ricans live, but it is a beautiful resort to go to and enjoy.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sun lakes", "Title": "\u201coverview\u201d", "Author": "strategy543", "ReviewID": "UR123887470", "Content": "My husband and I met Lisa Gelabert when we entered the St. Regis resort, and were given a thorough tour of the property.

Over the past year, we have been fortunate enough to stay at St. Regis Hotels in DC, San Francisco, Monarch Beach, and Florence. The St Regis Bahia Beach is truly the most beautiful of these properties. This hotel is also your best Starwood choice when visiting Puerto Rico. We recommend it \"slightly\" over the W Hotel - Vieques, where we stayed last year (read our review). Here's why: Property/Grounds - The hotel was built on a former coconut plantation. Even though the property is only about a year old, the gardens are mature and magnificent. The beauty of the resort primarily comes from the trees and plants that surround you. Our daily walks along the golf coarse and river felt like having your own private botanical garden. The hotel has twelve separate guesthouse buildings. Buildings 1 & 2 are located on the golf course while 3 through 12 face the ocean. All are beautifully situated, but if you want to hear the ocean sounds, chose from buildings 3 through 12 Rooms - We were fortunate to be upgraded to a suite in Building 6 on the second floor. This was one of the best Starwood hotel rooms we have stayed in. The bathroom was luxury perfect which included a 6x6 rain shower, king size tub, signature TV in mirror, heated floors, and double sinks. The living room included a 42 inch TV, Bose Audio/DVD system, comfortable sectional sofa, refrigerator, tray ceiling & wet bar. All was beautifully decorated. The outdoor terrace was spacious and comfortable for morning coffee or in room dining. Remember free in-room coffee is include with butler services. If not, complimentary coffee/tea is available in the Plantation House each morning till 10:00am. Pool/Beach - The pool area is spectacular with ample space for all. Cabana's were available for an additional fee, but not needed since the design of the pool area naturally provides individual spacing. For those wishing to sun by the water, chairs, towels, and umbrellas were readily available. The beach is great for sunning/relaxing, but the water was rough and not swimmer friendly. Dining - The St Regis is home to three restaurants; Sea Grapes which is basic pool side food. Molasses which is located at the golf club which specializes in local food, and Fern which is located on the second floor of the Plantation House. All are very expensive. Our best meals were not at the St. Regis. Customer Service - The customer service was very good. From the moment we arrived we received first class treatment. Butler services were included in our suite room charge. Concierge, butler and maid services were outstanding. All staff made it a point to greet you with a smile. You could tell a few servers were newly hired and were still in training. Amenities/Resort Fee - The hotel charges a $60 resort fee in addition to your daily room rate. This type of fee as been instituted by Starwood at all of their resorts. It just another way to help the hotel make a profit, similar to the airlines charging for luggage. Unfortunately, the fee does not cover parking, which is another $22. Your resort fee covers Wi-Fi, gym, pool, and non-motorized equipment. Boche ball and croquet are also available. Overall, we loved staying at the St. Regis Bahia Beach. The property is new, gorgeous and first class. This hotel is about relaxation. The palm trees, rooms, beach and acreage lends itself to decompressing from the corporate world. Bring your best resort attire and pretend your last name is Trump or Kennedy. You'll have the time of your life. Helpful Hints - 1. Rent a car. This property requires your ability to come and go as you please. 2. Eat off site whenever possible. The food on site is average and over priced. 3. Stop a Ralph's Grocery for miscellaneous items to save a few bucks. Red Box also available. 4. Day Trips- if you're looking to occasionally get out of the resort visit the rain forest, Old San Juan, and Ponce. There's even an outlet mall about 15 minutes from the hotel for those rainy days - Route 66. 5. First Day - Spend the first day of your stay on site to acquaint yourself with all the St. Regis has to offer. This will help you determine how much extra time you'll have for off-site activities. 6. Morning Walks- Get up with the sun one morning while walking on the beach. You'll remember the morning for years to come. 7. Bring your best resort attire - This property deserves your respect and for you to look your best. Helpful Hotel Suggestions - 1. Why charge a separate fee for parking? Just include it in my resort fee. It just feels like you're nickel and diming your customers. 2. Your Sunset toast is very odd. You invite your guests to watch/listen to a champagne tradition. You open a bottle yet don't provide any complimentary drinks. That's like inviting someone to dinner and then ask them to pay for it. Where are your manners? 3. Beach Front Needs Work - The weakest part of your property is your beach front. The sand and area for your guests is not well kept and feels more like staying at the Sheraton rather than the St. Regis. It's high time you hire an architect and designer to improve this space. It should look like a picture out of a magazine. 4. Beach Lighting - Some of your guest have compared your resort to the Four Seasons in Hawaii. This is a huge compliment. One of the things they do at night is light up a small section of the oceanfront at night. It provides a reason for your guests to come out at night before retiring for the evening. We recommend you light up the estate lawn looking out to the ocean till Fern closes. It's a gorgeous area that disappears after the sun goes down. 5. Plantation House/Fern - Fern is definitely the best restaurant on the property. It deserves white table cloths and better lighting to accent it's importance. We also believe the second story front balcony is a special place that should be used as a sunset bar or after dinner gathering place. Most of your guests don't even know it exists.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGrand experience with small flaws\u201d", "Author": "Rufenacht", "ReviewID": "UR123740639", "Content": "Selection of restaurants is limited in in available as to the hours of the day.

The vacation exceeded our expectations! The property is huge and beautiful, and very well-maintained. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and beautiful. The bathroom in itself is a place to hang out in. The staff all genuinely aim to please. We took advantage of many of the property facilities so I'll give you a little summary of our highlights. Plusses: Gorgeous property, beautiful nature everywhere you look, iguanas running around, it's spectacular. Staff are great, sincere, helpful, and happy to drive you around the property in golf carts whenever you need it. So much to do on-property: golf, tennis, great pool, nice beach, bird sanctuary, bicycles, sailing on the lagoon, Beautiful golf course, nice driving range. Nice gym facility too. Good food at the restaurants. GREAT Iguana Club (kids club). Our kids were very hesitant at first, but the staff there were very special and made the kids want to go and stay there every day! Great buffet breakfast by the pool every morning. Also very close to El Yunque, so an excellent family-friendly day trip from the resort. Small minuses: Only 2 tennis courts. This disappointed because it was sometimes hard to get a court time. The golf carts driving around on the property around the rooms were sometimes annoying when you are walking around to the main building or to the pool and back. The staff always stop to let you pass, but still... The resort is very secluded. Which is a big plus in my opinion, but it is nice to get out once in a while. We got tired of the food offerings at the resort after the first few days. So you either need to rent a car or take a taxi anywhere you go, easily adding at least $75-100+ to your outing. Just so you know. Bigger minus: The week before we arrived, the hotel sent us a form asking about our preferences, restaurant, tee-time or court reservations etc. We were impressed! We have food allergies and intolerances (gluten) in our family. So this was important. And we sent them the details of those allergies. What impressed us more was that they sent us a follow up form the following day asking for more detail. This was a first! However, when we arrived to the hotel and asked about any special foods at mealtime, nobody knew what we were talking about! So they asked but didn't deliver, quite disappointing.

The place is visually beautiful,it was like being in jurassic park, love the privacy. Let me start about the golf course its fantastic anyone who plays will appreciate this course and with a starwoods membership you get reduced rates still expensive but better. We stayed in room 733 third floor walking distance to pool and beach loved the balcony could hear waves crashing but couldnt see the water that was fine gave us more privacy. Ate at all three resturants, Fern was delicious had the wine pairing, portions alittle small and it was expensive but really good, did it twice. Ate at molasses once would not do that again, had lunch at seagrapes very good food and service.The pool area was relaxing and beautiful, the beach the water the waves the sand all BEAUTIFUL I saw nothing wrong and went swimming several times loved it and you could boogy boardhow great is that most of the other resort beaches in the area have no waves. The tennis courts while only two they were new ingreat shape and in a great setting loved it. The third floor room with cathedral ceiling and sliding glass doors out to the balcony with in room wet bar and refrig was wonderful loved to open the door and hear the waves crashing. The grounds getting from one place to another and the building were all beautiful. My wife and I rented a car and drove around to the other resorts in the area Trump, RioMar, and The Ritz Carlton none of them in my opinion were as nice. We also drove to EL YUNQUE rain forest its close and worth doing but go early before the bus tour crowd you can do it without the tour no big deal. Last about the service everyone was very nice and pleasent they really try hard and are very nice I think not all of them have the experience they need just yet but even those who dont try hard. If you like to drink like us stop at Ralphs grocery store pick up some wine beer vodka and some snacks and mixers its more convenient and saves you some money there is some room in the refrig.

PROPERTY: Though I have stayed at other, more beautiful St. Regis properties, this one is still stunning and serene. Like many exotic St. Regis locations, the lobby is amazing, and once you walk in the front door, you can see out the back and admire a long lawn leading to a beach and the endless ocean. It is breathtaking, and it's where we watched the sunrise when my fiance proposed. The entire grounds are well manicured and I love the few minutes of the jungle-like path when you are entering the resort. Love it. SERVICE: As usual, St. Regis service goes above and beyond most resorts. However, at this one in particular, something is a bit off with a few people -- I stress it's only a select few, but, it was enough to be frustrating i.e. the receptionist couldn't find a menu for an on site restaurant and told us to \"just go check it out [ourselves] and see if [we] like it\"... you pay up for service and she should have figured it out considering she lost the book that was at her desk in the first place. Further, she was useless when we asked about things to do in the area. The bartender on the other hand was very informative and we took his advice to explore the rainforest and check out the waterfalls nearby. Also, as I mentioned, I have been to other exotic St. Regis locations and the service here is not up to par with them. BUT, because we'd just gotten engaged, I must say, the resort took amazing care of us -- they worked with my fiance in advance to let us check in early, upgraded us to a suite, and after our engagement they sent us strawberries and champagne, offered to run us a romantic bath with rose petals, and sent us champagne over dinner. That's great communication and really touching when they do these little things. FOOD: We had a couple of meals out by the beach club/pool area, which in our opinion wasn't that great though the view was beautiful. I have to say, we loved the restaurant upstairs in the lobby (can't remember the name) so much, we didn't bother eating dinner elsewhere. We had some dietary restrictions, and our server didn't hesitate to get the chef to speak with us directly about our needs. This is major for those with food allergies, and this a big plus on their part, as even some top restaurants in NYC don't do this for you. We did have some in-villa dining which was also amazing, and we once asked the server for hot sauce which he returned with in under five minutes -- solid. We had brunch outside in the garden one morning which was also beautiful, though a few creatures and birds did start hovering and we had to move indoors. ROOMS: my, oh my! The suite we stayed in was facing a garden and it was beautiful. You enter the room to find in the foyer a bar and the first of two bathrooms. Then you enter the living room which has sliding doors to go outside, a tv, a bose sound system to play music while lounging in there, books and magazines. After that, you find the entrance to the master bedroom, also overlooking the garden outside the sliding doors. The close is spacious enough. The bathroom is fantastic! Two sinks, separated bathroom, and a rainforest shower and bathtub area. The mirror in the bathroom actually has a TV within it! It's impressive, but we didn't even use it once. Room service was prompt and kept everything clean and organized. Overall, we really loved this resort and enjoyed our stay. The engagement went perfectly, and the service that followed was lovely. With the exception of a hiccup here and there (it happens, whatever), we will be back.

However, although I believe the St. Regis can do better, this is still a VERY fantastic resort, and we absolutely would go back. My Take on the great and the not so great: * Upgraded to a HUGE 1 bedroom suite upon arrival thanks to our SPG status. I will note that because of a lot of reviews here suggesting a room close to the plantation house, we almost missed this opportunity because we made the request on our pre-arrival form. I don't quite get everyone complaining on this site about the size of the grounds. Even if you do have to walk, what a wonderful walk it is on wooden paths through a rain forest. 10 minutes max. You are on vacation in paradise people; enjoy it! Otherwise, golf cart service was fine for us when necessary. * Communication needs to improve amongst all areas of the resort. This is the key to better service. For example: Because of our upgrade, we were given free \"butler service\". We are told our butler would come by the room to introduce himself to \"just call, whatever you need, the Butler will handle.\" The Butler never came by and, when we called for various things (reservations, etc.) we were always transferred to handle the changes/requests ourselves. Also, I avoided getting coffee service in the room every morning because frankly, just didn't want to keep spending more $$$. How annoyed was I when I found out upon check-out that was included free of charge! Every morning I got dressed and walked up to the plantation house lobby for coffee when I would have much rather been relaxing on our balcony. Finally, you apparently need reservations for every meal. We made a reservation for new years on our pre arrival form but often ended up waiting to eat because we had no reservations. Again, told one thing by butler service and found out otherwise once we arrived to dine. We just couldn't figure out what the butler service really did that made it special. * Spa= awesome facilities but SO expensive. I stuck with a facial and it was really great. However, while waiting for my treatment in the relaxation area, there were no clean glasses for water or tea and, I never saw one person in that area beyond checking in. * The pre-arrival form seems to be nothing but a novelty. No idea why we needed to complete in advance because we ended up having to remake all reservations for dinner, spa, etc. I actually made my own spa reservation online even though I'd requested one of the form. * Food. Everything is expensive and some of it is NOT worth the price. All meals at Fern were excellent and Molasses was good as well. But, Seagrapes is pretty average for what they're charging. Across the board, ingredients missing more than once, or included in things that weren't listed on the menu. (No whip cream with waffles from room service, no olives in greek salad at pool, tomatoes in sandwiches that weren't listed on menu, \"crispy\" shrimp coming out as steamed. ) Not enough to complain but a 5 star resort should be getting this right every time. * Pool was awesome but just be prepared to spend $18.00 for a Pina Colada. Ouch. * Beach is still beautiful even though it is more murky than expected. * We screwed up and did NOT stop at Ralph's before the turn to the road to the resort like others suggested. We regret that because after 5 days without leaving the resort, those $5 Diet Cokes and $18 cocktails add up. Make sure you do this to stock up on wine, drinks, etc. Otherwise, you'll pay for it. * The resort is really isolated like others suggest. We didn't mind this but if you have big plans for exploring Puerto Rico, I might stay elsewhere unless you rent a car. This is an amazing resort that will get it completely right soon; the staff is very friendly and wants to please. Even with the above, we'd go back because it is such a beautiful, luxurious, relaxing place worth a high price tag.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington D.C.", "Title": "\u201cWe had a very nice time at St. Regis Bahia Beach\u201d", "Author": "TooFrequentTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR122728567", "Content": "We went in between Christmas and NewYear's, several couples, with children of all ages (2-18).

From the moment we got to the large stunning resort we truly felt taken care of. Here are brief breakdowns on our stay: Rooms / Bathroom: We had a suite in which there was a sitting area that connected to a room with a king size bed. The rooms were immaculately cleaned and they opened up to a very generously sized balcony. The sliding doors opened up and make the room even larger and also allowed us to view the gorgeous scenery. There was a table and couch outside that's perfect for reading a book and relaxing. The bathrooms are stunning! Not only are their TVs in the mirrors but the shower is literally the size of a small room. There is also a large soak tub by the shower. Food: I had read a previous post that said there wasn't a breakfast buffet but there was one when we stayed there at SeaGrapes. The buffet was good but the breakfast at Fern was absolutely amazing. Their french toast is literally the best I've ever had. The service was also top notch. We also had a great dinner at SeaGrapes (highly recommend the skirt steak) as well as a great Christmas meal at Molasses. Room service was good and was delivered in less than 30 min. Kids: When we got to our room there was a crib set up for our daughter which is something I requested before we checked in. Even though we were traveling with 2 small children we always felt like there were things for us to do. As previous people have mentioned the property is set on over 500 acres and you can get bikes from the boat house and enjoy the beautiful scenery. If your kids are to young to ride a bike they have attachments so that they can sit behind the bike. This was a great way for us to explore the whole resort. They also have a kids club called the Iguana Club. While my daughter was to young to stay by herself, we were allowed to use their facilities. They have a basketball court, play ground, video game room, craft room, movie room, and reading room. It was great!! I would 100% recommend this hotel/resort.

We had a second floor garden suite, which was great. We loved the interior decor which was tasteful and sophisticated yet kid friendly and comfortable. The highlight of our room was the deck it was large with a couch and table that seats four. The bathroom (s) were clean and spacious-and one even included a t.v in the mirror. Service: Wow!!!!! not only was there an extreme population of staff but each and every one would do anything and more to make your stay incredible.

The possibilities are endless the concierge, (and everyone else) are great with helping you book and schedule. Off campus ideas are bioluminesent kayaking,hiking in the rainforest, and food tasting tours in san juan just to name a few. Property: The resort is smartly designed. The way the paths and layout is designed you feel as if you are the only guest. The pool area is great and the beach is nice- but not exactly white sand, calm blue waters.

Transportation is VERY expensive, to / from airport, if you plan to leave the property, and hired cars (with driver) are pricey. It is best to pay the approximately $200 for their scheduled service and stay on the property. There is a great walk path through a sanctuary, gym is good, and pools nice. The beach is windy but we sat there each day anyway. Beach assistants quickly put up an umbrella and place your towels at the spot of your choice. It is a very nice escape in quiet luxury. It's a little like going to the country, but at the beach. Great for a romantic couple's get away.

My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and we chose the St. Regis because it looked amazing and *we had enough points to stay here for free for 4 nights*. This is key -had we paid to stay here I think we would have easily been taken for a ride and very disappointed. As others have pointed out, \"Bahia Beach\" is situated on what used to be a sugar plantation. It has tremendous acreage of lush green rain forest and it is very beautiful. There is a walking/jogging path, a boat house where you can rent paddle boats, kayaks, and bikes, an herb garden and access to a man made river which is not easy on the eyes. There is a spa which we did not use, a gym which we did, and it was decent, although out of 4 treadmills, only one was working. There are also a couple stationary bikes, elliptical machines, weights and a yoga studio. They have apples and waters available too. The pool area is definitely the highlight. It's shaped like an infinity and there is plenty of room to spread out on lounge chairs without feeling like you are on top of people. But the service was S-L-O-W and I do mean slow. This wasn't a huge issue for us, I mean we're on vacation, it's not like we were in some big hurry. But from the time we ordered lunch to the time it actually arrived over an hour went by. It was a grilled chicken sandwich by the way, and it was OK. They should do away with the cheezy muzak consistently pumped in from speakers located in the foliage. I think most guests could do without it. If the beach is your thing: go somewhere else. Again, as others have laid it out, (and you can see in the photos) due to the runoff, the ocean water is brown. It's clean and you can swim in it, but it is not very inviting. The sand, also brown. I should mention that we rented a car (which I highly recommend if it's your first time in PR) so we were at the very least able to drive to other beaches (Fajardo, Punta Tuna, Punta Guilarte Beach in Arroyo) which were lovely. Day 1: (It's a 25 minute ride from SJU to Rio Grande via Route 3) When we arrived the staff were quick to welcome and greet us. Our experience with the staff was very positive. They were friendly and helpful, although as other reviewers mentioned, service can be slow. Upon check-in we were led to the main plantation house and told that someone would be right with us. Of course, a half hour and 2 pineapple mojitos later we had to flag someone down to check us in. It seemed like they forgot about us. It took about 20 mins to check-in, which I think is a little much. We had Casa Santuario 612 which is close to the plantation house and pool, so we were able to walk rather than be whisked around in the golf carts. When you walk in to the \"casa\" it's actually a suite, so you step into a large shared vestibule, as there is another room across from yours. Our neighbor across the way must have played golf each day because like clockwork 3 days in a row the loud slamming of the door woke us up at 6:30 in the morning. 612 is a decent room, 2 double beds, large entryway with bar area (which we thought was a total waste of space as there is no seating area), closet, HUGE bathroom with huge shower area, soaking tub, two sinks, and separate small room with toilet. There is a desk with a chair and sliding glass doors that go out to a small patio overlooking the garden. They did bring us a bottle of champagne for our anniversary which was definitely a nice touch, but I will say that we have had better \"nice touches\" at other Starwood properties. That night we ate at Fern and our experience was a good one. We sat outside on the porch overlooking the ocean, the service was very good and our food (steak and grouper) was tasty. We also ate breakfast there one morning. The French Toast was delicious, the eggs were also very good and we had a fruit bowl of pineapple, kiwi, and strawberries which was excellent. Day 2: Weather terrible. Pouring rain so we decided to drive south. It was sunny on the carribbean side of the island so we stayed there all day. Went to Fajardo where the ports are and Punta Guilarte Beach which was beautiful. It's about an hour and half drive. Stunning. Water was lovely. We ate on the road in Ponce. Road side kiosk. Food was cheap and delicious. It was nice to get out and explore. Day 3: More rain. Went to Old San Juan. Ate at Metropol in San Juan. Food was delicious (get the stuffed cornish hen). Marmalade in Old San Juan is also an excellent choice for dinner. Day 4: Still cloudy and rainy. Walked around the property. Had room service. Food was very good. As far as the prices, depending on your expectations, everything is available on the property if you don't feel like exploring, and so you will pay for that. 2 pineapple mojitos, 30 bucks. Dinner At Fern: $150 for two entrees, two glasses of wine. I am ashamed to admit that we paid 3 bucks for a banana the morning we left. No matter how much money you have, how do you justify that? Room service also ran us over 60 bucks for 2 burgers and 2 ginger ales. You can go to the large chain grocery store, Ralph's on Route 3 and stock up if you don't want to pay the resort prices, as there are refrigerators in the rooms. Having a car was great and allowed us to explore and escape crummy weather, but it's 22 bucks a day to park at the St. Regis. We did sign up for snorkeling and the Bio Bay Tour, but each day they were cancelled due to the inclement weather. I doubt we would stay at this property again. It was very beautiful, but I can't say it was exceptional. My overall perception is if you paid $800 and over to stay here, sadly you paid too much.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort, Average Service\u201d", "Author": "arthursiew", "ReviewID": "UR121951952", "Content": "The St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort is a very large resort that was beautiful.

The resort is beautiful but service has been horrid. Check in was smooth and we waited at lunch for the rooms to be cleaned. Lunch had mixed reviews as I thought my mahi sandwich was delicious yet my wife thought her chicken was lacking. As we got to our rooms they were very nice standard rooms. There were a few small problems as one of the sinks did not drain and the mixing valve in the shower was broken (could not control hot and cold water, either scalding or freezing). My wife noticed housekeeping did not give us shampoo and I called to request. It took over an hour for shampoo to arrive. As I was in the shower someone came and gave my wife 2 bottles of water. They did not ask if we would like turn down just handed her water and left. We had a 7:00 reservation at fern and before we were seated I told Daniel at the front desk about the problems and he said engineering would take care of the bathroom and housekeeping will turndown the room while we dine. Fern was average. Appetizers were good but entrees were not to par other than the veal Milanese. The Parmesan crusted chicken was greasy and dry (contradicting but true). Desert was good although the meal for 4 without wine was not worth the $360 price. I highly suggest bring nice wine from home. Wine list is extremely expensive and not very good (6 times retail on some bottles). Grocery stores on the island do not have much selection. Joseph Phelps Cabernet and Don Melchor Cabernet were the best selections at Ralph's. When we returned from dinner, no one had done anything with the room. I called down and the front desk said housekeeping would be right up(9:30 pm). We decided to go next door and have a bottle of wine with friends. At 11:00 we went back to the room and nothing had been done. I phoned down again and was apologized to and offered breakfast. I explained I do not want gratis, I want service indicative of St. Regis standards. This morning we woke up without towels, a shower that is still broken, and a sink that won't drain. Management is supposed to do something but they are fully committed. I hope this vacay get better fast! Day 2.... I woke up with a new day attitude and it was quickly spoiled. As we went to meet our friends for coffee at 10:15 in the plantation house. I was told the coffee was gone but I could have decaf or hot water. I asked if there is any place I could buy a cup. She insisted on the prior options 3 times until \"giving in\" and going upstairs to get a cup. Let me remind you I asked to buy a cup. I sat down with David, a manager and told him that Vanessa said he would contact me in the morning. I explained the loose ends from the night before and he told me everything would taken care of and told me he would call to follow up. I am still waiting on a call. The sink was taken care of but I think the shower valve needs to be replaced. We ate at molasses for dinner and it was good. I would suggest the steak or pork chop and dessert is a must. Today is sunny, so we had plans for the pool. We ate breakfast at fern and were again disappointed. They forgot a smoothie and another entree was prepared incorrectly. I think the new management needs to focus on service and clean house. We are at the pool now and it is beautiful! Probably one of the better resort pools I have been to. Still have not seen our \"signature butler\" but fingers are crossed.... To be continued.... In conclusion, check your expectations at the gate. Until changes are made you will be disappointed. This is a beautiful facility, but the service is not to par with a 3 star Mexican all-inclusive. Molasses is very good. Eat there and you will not be disappointed. Fern is underwhelming and frankly bad. There are not any breakfast option worth patronizing. The pool is great! The rooms are very nice. The beach is brown sand but secluded. The water is not the blue-green most expect in the Caribbean, but nice. The weather can be temperamental. All this said, service will make this your only trip here.

The property was absolutely huge -- spanning approximately 500 acres with the sister condos and such, and yet felt like a small boutique personalized 5 star hotel. Everything was first rate and I'd highly recommend -- although I'd caution I went on SPG points and do not know how much of a premium I would pay in cash versus another luxury hotel. I knew being a brand new resort it would be absolutely beautiful and it was. But I was most concerned with previous posts about bad service, and I have no idea what reviewers are talking about. We have stayed at St. Regises, Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons and others around the world, and the service, effort and attitude of the staff was really second to none. Food came quickly. Drinks came quickly. Rooms were always made up promprlt. Requests answers quickly. Doors were opened. Smiles were always there. Hellos were said. Except for one silly incident, the service was pristine. By far the best feature of the facilities was that everything was of course very well thought out as it was brand new. The pool had all different levels and mini enclaves, so that no one was on top of each other and everyone had their own \"view\". The rooms were all separated into 7-9 different villas (or casas), each of which held no more than 6 rooms per floor, each with private double door entryways. Everything felt like it was your own personal resort. If I could point out a few CONS just in the interest of full disclousre: 1) The property is really really large. So large that you'll be taking golf carts to dinner if you're going to the secondary restaurant Molasses. Or if you're going to the Boat House to gets bikes or boats, etc. This of course adds to the beauty of the place as it's expansive and beautiful - but at some point gets a little bit annoying. Like if you want to rent a bike, it's a whole production to get the golf cart, etc.. Or you can walk 15 minutes, which again, is no problem and beautiful, but obviously wastes a bit of time and energy. 2) My one silly service incident: we left some stuff (bottle of sunscreen, magazine) on our pool chairs to take a little walk and then a torrential downpour came while we were gone from the area. We expected, maybe, that pool staff would quickly collect all towels so they didn't have a disaster on their hands and our stuff would either be sitting their in the rain or be collected. When we made it back to the pool after the rain died down, our suscnreen and magazine were gone, and not with the pool staff, and the pool staff looked at me like I was absolutely crazy for asking or suggesting they knew where it was. I half expected in the ensuing chaos of collecting 200 towels in a downpour that they might misplace one or two things -- BUT I did not like their attitude in this one instance. They pretended to have no idea what I was talking about, as if it was impossible that any hotel guest brought a personal item to the pool. They acted similarly ridiculous to a little girl who lost her pool goggles, and had an attitude to her as well. Just confess or apologize that you were moving quickly and couldn't catolog everyone's belongings in a monsoon -- but please don't look at me like I'm crazy for asking where my stuff is. This was literally the only example of poor service on the whole trip, and obviously a case of people not wanting to admit they had done something very stupid. A secondary point on this incident is there were other times during very sunny weather where pool staff seemed awfully quick to get rid of people's towels, pull down umbrellas, even if they had just walked away for a minute to go to the bathroom, etc.. It was if they were waiting for guest to leave so they could go home. 3) I don't have a good solution for this, but it was slightly annoying that there was no breakfast buffet, even if they were to charge a ridiculous premium. We're personally not breakfast people so to endure the formality of ordering in a very formal restaurant and waiting 15-20 minutes for food is a waste of time to me when I want to start my pool day, particularly with the very expensive prices. But I understand how buffets can become less elegant and/or inefficient for a fine hotel like this, so not the biggest deal. 4) Lastly, turndown service: The great hotels of the world need to declare a new system for this. We have found no matter what fine hotel we're staying in turndown service is erratic and haphazard. In some cases (not here), it never happens or happens 50% of the nights, as if the hotel has no way to monitor who is being serviced. In others, they show up at your door at 4pm for evening turndown service and ask to make the room, even though it's not nearly evening and of no use at that time and then seem to have an attitude when you ask them to come back. It basically then becomes a negotiation, which is not the service I'd expect. Here, I'd say they were reasonably good compared to the bad actors and definitely came each night, but they did show up at the door at 5:30-6pm each night. This isn't terrible - but if hotel restaurants don't open until 6pm, then in most cases people haven't started their night out and are likely not out of their rooms for the night at 5:30pm. And we've found to ask them to leave and come back is something of a game of chance. Just a pet peeve, but it's been so consistent that hotels need to rethink the process. That's really it. Loved the trip. Have wonderful things to say. Although if I was paying $1,000 cash a night, I'm not sure how happy I'd actually be.

They called and said our room was ready at about 3:00 and when we were ready, we were taken to our room by a very welcoming and informative employee named Christopher. The room was beautiful, quiet, great balcony, comfortable bed and pillows. I overheard several guests attempting to secure upgraded rooms. I don't know why people were obsessed about this. The \"standard\" rooms here are 100% nicer than any room an most people's homes. I'm a platinum member also, but my standard room was better than most of the hotel rooms I've EVER stayed in - and I'm sure these people also. For dinner we went to the Kiosks at Loquillo down the road about ten minutes. Average food but fun atmosphere. Back to the hotel for drinks at the bar. Alsmost empty in the evening despite the full occupancy rate. This property is gorgeous. Everything is manicured beuatifully, and despite prior comments, the beach is raked every morning. Sorry people, but this is an island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Stuff washes ashore. Remember Tom Hanks in castaway?? It's not trash, it's ocean debris and they clean it up daily. And sometimes, stupid people on boats throw their water bottles overboard. It was very busy through Saturday night. I didn't care for all of the kids (and their parents) yelling from the pool. I do think young kids should have their own pool area. There were obviously a lot of familes going home on Sunday, because it became much quieter. Monday and Tuesday it was very quiet - fantastic for us. Only one negative comment from me and it is by no means a deal breaker. Food and drink is outrageously expensive - other worldly expensive! As previous posters suggested, go to Ralphs (a very large, bright supermarket) near the hotel and stock up on sodas, chips, whatever floats your boat. Every time you order two Bloody Mary's by the pool it will set you back $33.00. Lunch - almost every item on the menu was near $20.00. That said, the food is quite good. Free coffee from 7:00am at the main house every morning and it's a great place to sit outside and watch the ocean. Leaving yeaterday was sad, but Rafael did all the work. Couldn't have been nicer!!

The staff was wonderful, made an effort to know and remember names of guests. The pool and beach area are large enough so that we (traveling with no children) did not feel as if we were being overrun by the 10 and under set. All three restaurants were quite good, prices in line with a typical 5 star property. This New Yorker was appalled by the exorbitant prices on the spa menu and therefore did not indulge. There have been some complaints on this site about drink prices but they may have changed, most cocktails we ordered were around $14 or $15, which was not out of the ordinary.

My wife and I went here for three nights in mid November. We were staying on Starwood \"Stay three, get away free\" promotion. We paid a fee to be upgraded to a suite with a ocean view instead of a standard room. The check in was slow but we didn't mind since they were serving a rum punch, but the suite was not ready when we were taken there by golf cart. We got a $60 credit per night on our account for this inconvenience which was nice. The food at both Fern and Seagrapes was very good, expensive, but good. Try the french toast at Fern, and the beet salad. Yes, beet salad. The beach was very clean, and was raked by tractor or by hand almost every day. It was nice to take a long walk in either direction each day. We found small shells and sand dollars, especially to the east. I swam in the ocean and found it warm and refreshing. The pool area was well kept, and the service there excellent including the frozen grapes, a treat. Although the resort was almost at capacity, it was never crowed feeling. There were very few families or kids. They offer bocce and croquet. The trails on the property were very well taken care of and relaxing to walk. The landscaping was wonderful. The bellmen were great. Rafael was especially terrific, always there to assist with the bags on arrival, to chat when we saw him on the grounds, and make recommendations when needed. However, there is room for improvement- Housekeeping was minimal spending only minutes in the room cleaning one day, and they left the vacuum cart with sheets and towels outside our door several days. Curious. They even entered our room when we had the do not disturb sign on. Not good. They were pressuring washing the pool one morning at 11AM, but finished quickly. It was also annoying that they took the coffee away of the common area at 10AM each day. I would like to see it offered later, perhaps 11AM. One day I just missed it, and I was not able to get a cup, and had to pay $6 for it. :( I think with a bit of training, and help they can get 100% on track with service. They seem to read the reviews, and attempt to make changes for the better. Take time to go to La Parrillo at the kiosks at Luquillo. The food is good, and service excellent. Also go into the town, and see the red sand beach and surfers. For transportation to the resort from the airport we used shuttlevanpr.com. Hit their web site, or e-mail them. More economical than the hotel. It is $85 one way for two. Another great option is Shawn at Luquillo Taxi - --. He took us to Luguillo and back in his Chrysler 300! He also does airport runs, rain forrest and other places. Nice guy. Take a day to visit Old San Juan. Remember PR takes the USD, and all the electric is the same. We did not golf, play tennis, or use the kayak or bikes, but all these areas looked great. A really nice property with a lot to offer.

For the positive, the resort built into the rainforest is absolutely stunning and huge, over 415 acres. Golf carts take you around the property and property is Eco friendly. Rooms are beautiful and large. We had a standard room which is large and had a beautiful terrace. The bathroom is one of the nicest I have ever seen. Large sunken tub with two shower heads, really spectacular. The girls had a suite because there was an electrical issue in room and it was dangerous. Suite was very nice with two bathrooms and living room. Really unnecessary for us but the girls loved the room. Carl, the tennis pro was fantastic and enjoyed his clinics and one on one time with him. The spa is lovely and has plenty of water all around. A complimentary glass of champagne is given. Prices are what you would expect at a resort and extras are given with massage at no charge, such as paraffin and hot stones. The boathouse offers kayaks, boards and bikes included in 60 per day resort fee. We also took a complimentary nature tour with a marine biologist that was interesting. Food is of high quality at the three restaurants. The concierge, Josell was very good and was a clef concierge. He went out of his way to make our stay enjoyable Now for the bad.....When checked in asked for upgrade and was told that they were full. Went to starwood web site and suites were available. Just be truthful that you do not want to give an upgrade. There are only three restaurants on resort with 138 rooms. Breakfast was painfully slow. Over 1 hr today and still no food. We ended up walking out. Service at sea grapes was poor first day but increasingly improved. Am used to paying high prices at a resort but sone things are just a rip off-165 one way car service from airport (paid 65 with Shawn-see review under luquillo), and 10 a glass for iced teas with no refills. Everything just seemed like an argument at hotel. Housekeeper didn't make up room one day. It is obvious that St. Regis mgmt is not here. When asked to speak to GM, was told that need to make an appt. Evidently, mgmt does not care about it's loyal guests. Check cashing was a nightmare. No one seems to know what to do here.

The price is really not crazy. We have gone to many all-inclusive type places around the carribean and price with air was in line. The biggest difference was we felt safer than say Jamaica or Bahamas and the workers were nicer...and meant it. Property: The grounds are beautiful well maintained and very tropical. No complaints. Pool: Very nice well maintained pool. Athough we had a 5 year old (who is very well behaved) there were a few parents who were letting their kids run around too much. Parents have to keep in mind it is a quiet resort and people want to relax. If you cannot control your kids go somewhere else this is a quiet pool area. Beach: we watched it get raked every morning, we found it to be clean. we read reviews complaining about sea weed washing up...really?!?! It is a beach that happens. Rooms: We had an ocean front room that was large, CLEAN, and just perfect. Balcony was very large and perfect for winding down with some wine at the end of the day. Our air-conditioner was not cold enough however when I called the front desk they sent someone to fix it in 10 min. After that it worked great!! I cannot say enough how clean and comfortable the room was and the view was beautiful. Shower very large, hot water worked great, large walk-in closet etc. Restaurants: Seagrapes is perfect for lunch or early dinner and it would be great if it were open for dinner. it's proximity to the pool and ocean would add to the dining experience. The chef Richard at Seagrapes came out during our first day and first meal to ask us if everything was ok. When I mentioned to him I had Celiac and my daughter had a peanut allergy he seemed to not really pay attention. HOWEVER, the next day he found us at the pool and informed us he had purchased Gluten free Pasta...which he made for me with grilled veggies and chicken and he also bought chocolate brownie cookies for my daughter so she could enjoy a dessert. Thank you Richard you really helped make our vacation perfect! Thelma and Pedro were also very attentive and excellent wait staff. Breakfast at Fern was very good, fresh well prepared food and excellent waitstaff. Mollasses: Excellent. We ate here two of the nights during our short visit. Mofongo was great and it is a must try! Service was also excellent. The first night we ate ate the bar and Ricky the bartender/waiter was so nice. He talked to us letting us know what he thought we would enjoy and even made a \"special ingredient\" mix for our daughter to put on her bread. He did it right in front of us and although it was only honey, butter and cinnamon my 5 year old daughter felt very important. Thank you Ricky! **The girl who seats guests at Molasses needs a lesson in politeness and should learn to smile but once you get past her Molasses is a nice dining experience. Prices: Our driver from the airport was nice enough to offer to stop at Ralph's super market on the way into the resort. It is a big very clean super market just like the U.S. that has alcohol. We bought 5 bottles of wine and a bottle of rum and pineapple juice and a thermos to bring it to the pool. We also bought snacks for our daughter and cheese for us to snack on. It was a good move and saved us some money. It was also nice to have cheese and wine on the balcony at night. We bought some breakfast stuff which was also nice to eat on the balcony in the morning. Make sure you make it down for the free coffee in the Plantation house in the morning it is good and will also save a few bucks. **The best thing we did was get our daughter the $25 a day food pass. she was able to eat whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted from the nice kids menu they had at each restaurant or by the pool. It has the usual kids menu stuff such as big grilled cheese sanwiches with fries, burgers, pizza, macaroni with butter, REAL mac and cheese, etc. Staff who pick up in golf carts are very nice and friendly and do a great job.

As much as I enjoyed being there, I was disappointed that the attention to detail that had made the first visit to the property so impressive was missing on this visit. The room had an HVAC problem to the point where there was mildew growing on the lampshades in the bedroom. In fairness to staff, i didn't realize or report this until the day of check out otherwise, I am certain it would have been repaired immediately. That said, a few more minor issues: the wrong room number on the patio entrance, the front door to the villa wouldn't close without a fight. Again, very minor, but given the rack rate for the room and the St. Regis reputation for service, I would have expected these issues to have been discovered and corrected long before a guest encountered them.

After seeing it on the \" hot List\" in a magazine and traveling all the way from the west coast I was left to wonder what the hype is all about. Yes- the suites are great. Spacious, comfortable, well appointed. beyond that- it's awful. SERVICE- A major problem. No one has been trained. There are no standards followed. Every request is a crap shoot. Every encounter leads a different result. One employee good. the next horrible. From check in to check out no one knows your name or is attentive. Waited at restaurants for seating at open tables, never saw or heard from our \" Butler\" in the 4 days we were there. Never had a bucket of ice. We had to call housekeeping supervisor TWICE due to poorly serviced room. Bath tub was dirty. Vanity not cleaned. Bed made messily. Dishes not taken away from night before. Floor not mopped or vacumed. A Mop and vacuum sat outside our door for our entire stay! After pointing it out to supervisor, the mop was put away but the vacuum stayed outside. POOL/BEACH- The biggest disappointment of the trip. This property is DIRTY. GARBAGE on the beach and around the grounds. This is not rubbish and seaweed that has washed ashore. ( although there is that too). The garbage is from the hotel! Plastic cups, straws, paper napkins, bottle caps, a cloth tarp, soda bottles, cigarette butts all laying in the sand and grass of the hotel! Chairs at pool are mildewed from rain ( never covered). Chairs and umbrellas at beach are ratty and worn. Attendants are not trained- I had to ask for water and a menu every day. And then no one came back to get my order. Maintenance was pressure washing a full pool deck at 10 am- PRIME TIME for guests. We had a cabana one day- It took three requests to unlock our mini bar. Attendant made up chairs with towels that had HOLES. The photos make the ocean water and sand look very tropical. Water is murky, sand is brown. If you want beautiful beach- this is not the place. FOOD/BEVERAGE- Again, a disappointment. Three restaurants on property and all basically serving the same thing. The biggest joke is their golf course location called Mollases. It is billed as Cuban food but menu reads almost identical to Fern restaurant. There is one pulled pork entree that could pass as Cuban \"inspired.\" Otherwise it is bistro fare served in a sports bar. TV 's are on but servers are dressed in suits. Tables are scattered with no flow or thoughtful placement. This is more event space for groups or a lounge for golfers - not a nice restaurant. Major identity crisis. Fern restaurant was OK. We sat outside on a full patio. Food was good. Server was obnoxious. He wanted to make sure we knew this was a Jean George restaurant and rambled on about all his other restaurants and how famous a chef he is. Menu was basic. Roasted Brocolini was burnt. Same exact chicken entree was served the next night at Mollases. Seagrapes by the pool was basic pool food. Burgers, pizzas, salads. Prices are ridiculous. $17 for a pina colada served in a cheap thin plastic disposable cup with a cherry. For those prices I want an acrylic tumbler and a wedge of pineapple at the very least. Husband is a diet coke drinker and refills were never offered. Getting water is a hassle. Had to ask for it at every location and it was never refilled. RESORT FEE- $60. THIS IS A CRIME! There is nothing included in this! Gym is small and unattended. Bottled water in room is never replenished. Morning coffee is not worth $ 60! Kayaks are a joke- they are located on a small \" swamp\" for your use. SPA- Small but nice. I had a massage. The therapist was professional and included nice extras such as hot stones and a scalp oil. Waiting area is nice and stocked with waters and teas and nibbles Again- poor service. Attendant asked if I would like my glass of champagne ( complimentary) before or after my treatment and then I never saw her again. Front desk attendant was more concerned that I was taking my tea mug and robe back to my room than asking if my experience was pleasurable.

The grounds alone are just amazing - you feel as if you've stepped into a pristine and (mostly) private jungle.

At night you are treated to a chorus of coqui tree frogs and other insects singing you to sleep. Our stay at St. Regis was unlike any other hotel/resort experience we've ever had. We would highly recommend it. Things we loved: Exploring the grounds is a must! Walk around and see everything. If you stay only at the pool, you're really missing out. Rent some bikes from the boat house (included in resort fee) and check out the trails around the bird sanctuary. Try the stand up paddle boarding (again included) and watch the birds and turtles around and in the lake as you get a great workout. Sip the free coffee on the porch of the plantation house and soak in the views. Find an iguana. Use the boogie boards and take advantage of the huge Atlantic waves. Read a book at one of the many private secluded sitting areas around the resort. Walk the beach. Spend an exorbitant amount of time under the rain shower. Things we would have changed: We got lucky the first few nights with no one in our adjacent rooms. On the last night, a couple arrived and we could sadly hear a lot from our room - including a coughing fit at 6 in the morning. Wish the rooms were more sound proof! We loved walking the resort at night, but there were areas that could have used more lighting. Nothing drastic, but there were a few unlit spots that we would have loved to explore. We also would have loved to have more dining options on the resort. If you're there on a weekday (Mon-Thur) your dinner options are Fern and the bar. It would be nice to have some more casual dining places open all week for all meals. Tips: (1) Rent a car at the airport. Yes, you will pay a $22/day parking/valet fee, but we loved that we were able to leave the grounds at any point to explore the island. We went to El Yunque rainforest (a 10-15 minute drive) and went hiking. We ate at a beach side restaurant near Luquillo, PR. We went to Old San Juan one night and had a homestyle Puerto Rican dinner. (2) You can buy wine and other groceries at Ralph's grocery store (about 5 minutes from the resort), which is highly recommended. The rooms have a mini fridge so you can buy and store cold groceries and drinks. (3) As mentioned before, take advantage of the entire resort. (4) The ocean/beach at the resort is not good for snorkeling - know that you're not going to have the clear blue Caribbean sea - but you will have some amazing Atlantic waves (perfect for boogie boards!). (5) Be on island time. Everything in PR is more relaxed and \"slower\" than what we're used to in the DC area.

They set up the chairs, towels and umbrellas for you. There's also a hot tub which was again, the perfect temperature. This is a place you can truly relax, unstress and be pampered. But of course, all this luxury comes at a price. It is very expensive to stay, eat and drink here. There are three restaurants: The main one (Fern) serves breakfast lunch and dinner. Breakfast will cost you about $40 each and it's all a la carte (no buffet here) an extra slice of toast is $5, an extra egg $8! The restaurant by the pool (Sea Grapes) only serves lunch and drinks. The third one (Molasses) is too far away to walk (take a golf cart) and beware of strange opening times- we never got to eat there because it is closed 3 days of the week. So we ate at Fern most nights, and the food is good but not excellent. Dinner for two will set you back at least $100. The service is outstanding. We loved the lunches at Sea Grapes, especially the brick oven thin crust pizzas with unusual toppings (try the one with figs and fontina cheese - so good) A cocktail or glass of wine will cost you about $16 and up. There is a spa and a fitness room and also a little boutique/gift shop and a car rental desk. The resort location is quite remote so unless you rent a car you'll have to take a cab to go anywhere. Cabs are a bit expensive. The nearest town is Rio Grande and there's really nothing there. We rented a car ($90 for a day) and drove to Luquillo, about 15 mins away. There are food kiosks along the beach there, serving local Puerto Rican dishes. A delicious lunch for two with beers was only $12! The next town is Fajardo where there's a lighthouse but you have to make an appointment to tour it. We didn't drive into San Juan because we've been there many times before but if you do, it will take about 30 minutes and the roads are mostly highway so it's no problem. There's not much nightlife at the St. Regis, so we drove to a nearby resort one evening for dinner (the Grand Melia) about 10 minutes away. It has a small casino and 3 restaurants but there was nothing much going on there either. We didn't really mind the lack of entertainment because the main purpose of our trip was to relax. We really enjoyed our stay at the St. Regis and we only had a couple of minor problems: (when you are paying this much to stay somewhere, you expect to find toilet paper in the ladies room)!! This was rectified quickly by an embarrassed member of staff. Checking out was a slow process (waited over 25 minutes for bell boy to pick up our bags, while our driver was waiting to take us to the airport). But again, that was only a minor annoyance. The St. Regis really does live up to it's five star rating. The service was first class and the resort is fabulous. If you want to splash out and treat yourself for a special occasion, this is definitely the place to go.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cWill not be returning\u201d", "Author": "cbuzz", "ReviewID": "UR120490575", "Content": "The property - simply breathtaking with the all the style and comfort that you would expect from the brand.

The weekend was simply a comedy of errors. The staff were clueless about the hotel. I was always met with a \"let me find out\" and they would just disappear never to be seen again. We had reserved an ipad at the front desk. We were told it was actually reserved under our names this ipad never surfaced and noone ever bothered to contact us about it either. Always kept waiting by this hotel and the staff had no idea about what services are offered. Worst thing that happened on this trip was that our bed was infested with bed bugs. On the last day of the trip my friend and I had these weird itchy bites all over that were definitely not mosiquitos. This itching was so bad I went to the doctor when I got back to New York and it was confirmed. Upon complaining to the hotel management they refused to acknowledge that and they insisted that it was mosquitoes. On the last day, we also reserved a taxi to the hotel. The front desk forgot to reserve the taxi - my friend ended up missing her flight because of this. Even though it was their fault they charged her an extra night at the hotel. Ambiance - none. There is nothing to do in the evening at this hotel. Its pretty far removed from San Juan and at night this hotel is just boring boring boring. Food - average. I enjoyed a pancake breakfast one morning at Fern and a nice dinner at Molasses. Everything else I had was just okay - lunch selections were nothing special other than your typical burger, hot dogs, salads. I will never stay here again and I will make sure no one I know stays here either.

From the property to the staff to the golf course. It is located @ 30 minutes north east of San Juan close to El Yunce. As a result, the weather may be slightly unpredictable especially in the fall. However, the views are spectacular. There a some aspects of the resort that some may qualify as a limitation. To me they are few but I feel I must share them with anyone contimplating this resort for their stay. #1. It's expensive...from drinks, to food, to vip car service, golf, spa, etc. My response would be that you should alreday know that going in. #2. Places to eat are very limited on the resort. Basically two restaurants and one pool side \"cafe\" that is open from 11-5. They serve drinks and light lunch. No breakfast though which is a head scratcher. The main restaurant Fern was great. Food is of ther highest quality and its difficult to get a bad meal. You may get tired of eating dinner their every night and may want to get out into San Juan at least once or twice during your stay. The pool is so pretty and the service their is outstanding. The beach is ok. They have close to 2 and 1/2 miles of private beach but its the Atlantic side keep in mind. Blue crystal beaches you will find in the southern part of the island(facing the carribean). The rooms were truly outstanding. I must confess, I stayed in a lux suite so I would expect nothing less. Tv in the bathroom mirror(first I've seen of that one) but very cool. If you are venturing out to San Juan may I suggest the vip service. Its 65/hr and driver stays with you. They know all the short cuts, best local places to eat(Mojitos!!!! cant say enough) and can access all the vip parking at most historical sights. It may in the long run be more cost effective than renting a car. That is for you to decide. If you are going out to dinner in San Juan...try Marmalade....absolutely wondeful. would put it up there with any restaurant in any major us city. All in all. i enjoyed my stay and would go back.

They said it would be right over and it never came. My husband eventually found an ice machine and we just got our own. We ran out of toilet paper and asked for more and it never arrived.

My wife and I are discerning travelers, and we travel infrequently, so researching a hotel and location takes quite a while -- despite mixed reviews, we chose the St. Regis Bahia Beach and are we glad we did! We spent 4 nights at the property, and had a wonderful, wonderful vacation. Upon arriving from the airport (I recommend toursanjuan,com) and pulling up to the luxurious grounds, we were very excited. Check in (with a rum punch) was smooth, and our room was ready in 15-20 minutes. We had a garden view room, right near the plantation house and the pool -- beautiful room with a foyer, bedroom, walk in closet, and amazing bathroom with a \"rain shower\". We loved the artwork, and the bed was very comfortable. Meals: Restaurants are somewhat limited, but the food is delicious (but priced like a resort). We had breakfast every day at Fern -- great food with a wonderful view of the ocean -- ask for Jay. We had lunch at the pool each day at Seagrapes -- great food and nice menu. Dinner we varied between Fern (priciest and special) and Molasses (at the pro shop -- a little cheaper but delicious). On our last night, we ventured into Loquillo to the kiosks and ate at #2 -- La Parilla -- a great taste of Puerto Rican cuisine. The Spa: Probably the nicest spa I have ever been too -- pricy, but fantastic. My wife and I had massages -- be sure to get there early to enjoy the relaxation area, outdoor showers, and saunas. Amazing. The Pool: Absolutely gorgeous, and where we spent most of our time -- a series of interconnected infinity-like pools with comfortable chairs -- pure relaxation. Only negative are the speakers that are hidden in the vegetation that play a loop of techno songs at moderately high volume -- my vote would be to get rid of the music! The Service: We had NO problems with the service -- everyone went out of their way to be friendly, and many learned our names by the end of the trip -- we had no problems in this area. The Property: Magnificent -- we took advantage of the walking trails each morning -- the more adventurous may choose to use the large lake (kayaks, etc.) or partake in the nature walks or beautiful golf course.

(My mother paid for the room/resort fees and we took care of the rest. Thanks mom!) Due to her relationship with the hotel she was given 3 nights free with breakfast, and the last 4 nights she purchased. This will be relevant, VERY relevant, shortly.... TIPS: Definitely rent a car if you plan on going anywhere outside the property. It will save you a great deal of money and give you flexibility. Stop at Ralph's for room snacks and drinks to save time/money. Breakfast at \"Fern\" is lovely. Try the french toast!! YUM! Visit the rainforest (see and swim at La Mina Falls). Do a bio-bay kayak trip to see the glowing water! Old San Juan is fun for shopping during the day but everything closes at 6pm so go early. Stay for dinner at SigloXX or splurge at Marmalade (tasting menu was fantastic!) PROS: The property is gorgeous. Expansive and clean. We were nearly alone our entire stay, never encountering more than 15 other guests total the entire week. Breakfast at Fern was delicious every day. Free coffee is offered in the lobby/plantation house from 6-11am each day. (It's $6/cup in the restaurant). Spa is huge and a beautiful part of the property. CONS: Kids are everywhere. I do not know why they don't keep them in the \"Iguana Club\" area but the pool was often overrun with screaming, splashing, running children most days. Keep an eye on your account or you may find yourself with unexpected/unauthorized charges! Room service food was generally OK but nothing to write home about. We do not understand what the $60/day resort fee is for as it does not include valet parking, coffee, newspaper delivery or any other noticeable amenities. (Yes, I know you can use their kayak for free.. great.) - Day 1: The property is just stunning! Our car was taken to valet and we were escorted to the reception desk and given a nice fruit juice cocktail. The check-in was a little rocky. Included w/our gift was free breakfast the first three days. They had no record of it but thankfully we brought our certificate, signed by the hotel manager, and they took it to make a photocopy for their file. Also, we had reserved an ocean-view room (specifically made sure to book this as it was our honeymoon and we wanted to watch the sunset from our balcony) and were told they were sold out so we would be on the golf course instead. We were just going to accept it as we are fairly easy-going and not generally picky... then she showed us the map of the property. Ocean-view rooms are a short stroll to the lobby/beach/pool. Course-view rooms need to call for a golf cart to come get them to drive them everywhere they are so far off the path! I then asked for a manger who apologized and said they THOUGHT we would have PREFERRED the golf-course room even though we had specifically requested the ocean view (and confirmed it via both phone and email prior). He kindly restored us to our original room so all was well though the whole thing seemed unnecessary. Confident that all was settled, we were ready to go to our room- then they told us it would be about an hour until it was ready. They offered to put our luggage in storage and we were happy to take a walk around the property and grab a bite/drink at the Seabreeze restaurant. (Seabreeze was OK food for pool-side fare. Nothing amazing but generally tasty bar food). After an hour we went back to see if our room was ready- and saw our bags had been \"stored\" outside where we left them by the car. I was a bit miffed as I feared my makeup may have melted in the heat for so long. However, we let it roll off us. The room was very close by (thanks to our ocean-view push), clean and plenty big for the two of us. The showers/tubs are especially nice and the balcony a lovely touch. Day 2: Breakfast at Fern- the french toast was AMAZING! Breakfast there is slow and relaxing. (Try a spicy bloody mary). Sit outside for a lovely breeze and view of the ocean. Unfortunately, they did not have our comp breakfast in their system but we brought our certificate as we had feared that may be the case. They easily accepted our comp, we left cash tip of over 20%. We spent the day at the beach- nearly entirely alone it seemed. Towels and chairs were set up for us, the sand was very clean and the ocean warm with nice waves. We had a wonderful time, ordered a drink which was brought to us- no complaints whatsoever. We went down to Old San Juan and ate at SigloXX (great paella, great coffee!). A wonderful day. Day 3: Breakfast at Fern- again they did not have our comp breakfast on file. A different manager gave us a very hard time about it but we were firm and confident it would be sorted out upon speaking to the front desk/general manager. Again we left over 20% tip cash. We went to the rainforest (go early to avoid crowds). Hiked the lovely trails and swam at La Mina falls. We tried the Luquillo kiosks for lunch and had some great conch. Upon our return, we decided to try the spa- it was lovely. HUGE space w/separate mens and womens sauna and pool areas. Water, dried fruit, etc. Very relaxing. My massage was a bit weak despite my requests for her to increase pressure, but still relaxing and overall enjoyable. My husband enjoyed his very much. A tad overpriced but nothing unusual for a resort spa in terms of pricing. We had room service that evening which was pretty good. Day 4: Breakfast at Fern- again they did not have our comp breakfast on file. (Funny as this day we overheard them tell another guest \"oh your breakfast is comped today- no need to pay\".... we had to fight for ours again). Again left over 20% tip in cash. We hung out by the pool for a bit (fairly deserted except the unattended children) then went to do some shopping in Old San Juan. Had a lovely day down there, bought some souvenirs, and had dinner reservations at Marmalade. DELICIOUS! Try Marmalade!! Day 5: Breakfast at Fern- waiter finally offered to comp our breakfast but we knew our comps were up now so we corrected him and charged it to the room plus his over 20% tip. Spent the day at the beach, then had dinner at the Luqillo kiosks, then went for a biobay kayaking excursion. Bio Bay is AMAZING. Definitely an experience you should not miss! Day 6: Breakfast at Fern- charged plus 20% tip to the room. Relaxed at the beach nearly all day. Were going to try one of the resort restaurants for dinner but nothing sounded very good (menus quite limited) and the reviews were very mixed. Instead we drove just down the road to a local restaurant, Antillos Puertoricano, it was great and very affordable. (Sangria was very tasty as was the mofungo!). Day 7: Went to breakfast outside the resort for something new Hung out by the pool and ate/drank. As we were checking out very early the next morning we decided to do a check on the incidentals then just in case the breakfasts were not yet sorted- YIKES. They had charged us every breakfast and added extra tip for themselves on top of our 20% cash tips. To be fair, this was quickly removed to honor our comp certificate. (Though we suspect the waiters walked away with 40% tips those first 3 days). But the biggest upset was that my mother had sent thoughtful gifts to our room each day (a bottle of wine, fruit, cake, etc...) And they had CHARGED HER GIFTS TO OUR ROOM! They were helpful in attempting to sort it out but I had to go through each expense with a fine-tooth comb to try to figure out what she had ordered vs what we had ordered during our stay. Then they had to CALL HER to get her to authorize the charges to her credit card and off of ours. How in the world did an outside party manage to call and make charges to our room/credit card? It seems absurd to me that that even occurred in the first place and they are very lucky it was a family member and that we were willing to sit there for 45 minutes and try to sort it out. In the end, we did end up paying for a few of her gifts to us (which is fine with us personally but absolutely unacceptable for a hotel in general. Very dangerous ground to allow an outside party to charge to a room without their explicit approval or signature). SO...Overall it was a great trip with a few hiccups. We were disappointed as those hiccups were absolutely preventable with a little organization and communication on the part of the resort. But it all worked out and we are not the kind to worry about that sort of thing for long. We loved our honeymoon. We loved our room and the property. The staff was kind and helpful from beginning to end. But we will be sure to keep all receipts to prevent future difficulties and illegitimate charges with this company. Last thoughts: My mother sent us a slice of cake for our honeymoon. It said \"happy birthday\" (it was not even close to either of our birthdays. Small mistake. But strange.) And while parked in valet an animal soiled our back windshield. They offered to clean it.... they forgot.. we reminded them.. they forgot.. we asked again.. they forgot. Four full days it remained there. We actually returned the rental car soiled they forgot so many times it never got done. Tiny details. But seems unacceptable for a self-proclaimed \"six star hotel.\"", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay at Bahia Beach\u201d", "Author": "PDRoberts", "ReviewID": "UR119269890", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the St Regis Bahia Beach as a one day stopover between red eye flights from the West Coast and going on a cruise in the Southern Caribbean. From check in to check out everything was simply marvelous. I've read the reviews by other memebrs and can't for the life of me figure out how some can be so critical of the staff. Property: As is uniformly reported the grounds and landscaping are exceptional as was the pool. The planting and thoughtfulness of the layout just can't be beat. We had lunch at a nearby town right before checking in and my wife was getting eaten alive by the bugs. At the resort there were none. The attention to siting the buildings in the landscape and the raised walkways to achieve a much higher level of sustainability was appreciated. Rooms: The rooms are terrific. We were in their basic accommodations which are still luxurious and huge by normal standards. great soaking tub. The bathroom was larger than the stateroom of the Serenade of the Seas where we spent the following week. I always find the television in the mirror at St. regis properties to be a gimmick gone too far, but the quality of the furnishings and the layout was all of high quality. I didn't realize until booking that at 52 I could still get a senior citizen discount with my AARP card. The savings for us were significant. Dining: We had a lovely dinner at Fern the one evening we were there. Expensive, but with corresponding quality. Breakfast the next morning was expensive, but with quite alot of tasty food. Drinks: The drinks at $18-20 by the pool is getting too crazy, but we had a meal by the pool and it was great. The pool staff was very attentive and came by fairly frequently. Service in General: My needed the Concierge for a couple of requests and they were most helopful. My wife wanted to go to Sunday mass nearby and the resosrt provided information promptly and arranged for a taxi to take and pick her up. Very freindly staff from start to finish. Helpful and professional, but not fawning. On Saturday night they do the sabering of the chanpagne and the staff seemed unprepared for the seventy folks who gathered. It took twenty minutes to get enough champagne served to everyone by which time one third of the folks had left. A gaffe yes, but a minor one. We would love to return sometime to Bahia Beach. Puerto Rico was more interesting than we expected and there is much too see such as the Biobays and the rainforest. If money is at all an issue, stock up at the markets on the way in for provisions. The do soak you pretty good and if staying for five days it could add up to a huge sum. Note: Drivers in Purto Rico are pretty wild. I haven't had so much fun with crazies in cars for twenty years. Drive on the wrong side of the road, no problem, cut other folks off, no problem. It really was kind of fun though, just keep your wits about you and be prepared for surprises.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Littleton, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cNice property, disappointing beach\u201d", "Author": "Angela837", "ReviewID": "UR119079087", "Content": "We just came back from a great visit to Puerto Rico and 4 nights at the St Regis Bahia Beach. Overall, the resort was beautiful, the service good (not blown away by it, but it was quite good), and the island was a nice respite for us. GETTING THERE -> We rented a car at the airport (more on that later) and took the more scenic route down 187 (vs the way that the hotel suggests down 66). It took about 30 minutes and afforded us ocean vistas, roadside kiosks, and lots and lots of trees with full canopies over the road. If you take this route, there are no signs telling you that you are close to the resort, so watch carefully along the road after about 20 miles for iron leaves indicating the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entrance. If you miss it, you will hit the town of Rio Grande and can turn around, so no biggie. Coming from the other direction (which we also did a number of times on our way to other stuff), you will see signs, but they will all say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bahia Beach Resort,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153St Regis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In general, there are only three main roads to know about: 187 and 66 meet up at the airport and then diverge, one (187) along the coast and the other (66) through the middle of the island; 66 then spills onto highway 3, which is the other road to know about \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 3 and 187 converge near the town of Rio Grande; 3 will take you into Luquillo and Fajardo. Once you master the layout of those 3, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really easy to get around. A note about leaving the resort going back to the airport \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we took 66 back and it should have been a quick 20 minute drive. However, it took almost 90 minutes in bumper to bumper rush hour traffic (it was a Tuesday morning around 7 AM). Luckily our flight was delayed otherwise we would have missed it. Just giving you a head\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to allow PLENTY of time! THE RESORT -> Upon arriving at the resort, you are first faced with an impressive gate house. You tell the attendant your name and they let you through, and then you will drive through very lush property towards the Plantation House. There, we were greeted by the valet who unpacked our car for us as we checked in. At check in, we were offered welcome drinks and a brief tour of the Plantation House while our room was being readied, and then we were whisked away on a golf cart to our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153casa.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A note about check-in, my husband is a Platinum member of Starwood but we were told that there were no upgraded rooms available. As we spent time at the resort, we were surprised by this considering it was MAYBE a third filled. Probably, they had already gotten the standard room ready for us and just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to bother. At this point, we also learned that the other Platinum benefits have changed. Others have mentioned getting free movies and other such benefits. The person checking us in explained that they no longer do this, and instead offered us our choice of 500 extra points or a $10 F&B credit daily or a book, times two. They were somehow out of the book (whatever it was) and so we split the difference and took one of each of the other two. As others have mentioned, the rooms are beautiful. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153butler\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who escorted us spent time showing us around the room, explaining how to turn on the TV in the bathroom mirror, showing us that the A/C automatically turns off when you open the sliding doors, etc. He also unpacked some of our things for us (including the groceries we had brought with us \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 see below). Never did he put his hand out expecting a tip, and this is indicative of everyone we interacted with at the St Regis. The entry to the room was a small vestibule and then you get to your private entry door, which made you feel like it was your personal apartment. The door itself had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privacy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd button which, when pressed, made your doorbell red in color so no one would bother you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no door hangers needed. The room was decorated in British colonial-style furnishings. We had a king bed, a small desk, a small easy chair, a small mini-bar with fridge, and a standard-size (maybe 36 or so) TV with a bluray player. The closet was large and the bathroom was, well, bigger than most regular hotel rooms, with a giant shower (two shower heads), double sinks, and soaker tub. There were free bottles of water on each side of the bed and above the mini-bar, and we learned that these were regularly replaced, so no need to buy your own water. Because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get upgraded to a suite, we did not get the full \u00e2\u20ac\u0153butler\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experience that others have written about. I want to be very clear about this, because after reading about all the great service on Trip Advisor, we were expecting that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but learned quickly that most folks who have written in must have received an upgrade. So, this means we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get coffee delivered to our room (instead, we had to walk to the Plantation House every morning and serve ourselves \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have a coffee maker in the room), nor did we really ever seem to have a dedicated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153butler,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but instead different random people who serviced us depending on time and request. Our room was on the ground floor, which we quickly became happy about, because you have an unobstructed view of the lawn outside your room and we felt like it was our own personal lawn. There were no bars on a balcony, just our patio that walked right out to the lawn, and from there, down to the path to the pool. We spent every morning drinking coffee and eating breakfast on our patio, watching the many lizards and birds that congregated there. Very memorable! The grounds are lovely and very lush. Think jungle-meets-beach, with luxury added in. Walkways between the various casas, the pool, and the Plantation House were raised wooden platforms, so you were above the jungle floor which was pretty cool. We regularly saw iguanas and other lizards as we walked around in the day, and at night the whole place came alive with singing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coquis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tiny frogs that live on Puerto Rico. We saw one of them when he stowed-away on our towel and we discovered him in our tub after we tossed the towel in there. Speaking of lush grounds, we spent a morning biking around the property (the bikes are free to use), and went into the nature reserve area of the property. We saw even more iguanas, turtles and birds. Where you rent the bikes is at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nature center\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd next to the pier area, and the service there was top notch. The staff there even helped us get some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sea grapes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from a tree overhanging the water. The pool area is great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c five or seven interconnected pools of varying depths, connected via a series of infinity ledges and waterfalls. They provided free sunscreen, although it was only 15 SPF \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not enough for us so we still used our own. The beach was so-so. The sand itself was full of seaweed. While I expect some of this, we have been to other beach resorts where they comb the sand early in the morning and I am not sure why they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that at the St Regis. The beach is crescent shaped and the St Regis owns a three-mile section of it. The chairs and umbrellas are free to use. The water was very warm and comfortable, but it was also very murky \u00e2\u20ac\u201c completely unlike any of the other beaches we passed getting to the resort and unlike others we saw when we went further east. It was also rough water with a lot of waves (good for body boarding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c free to use). Overall, we were disappointed by the unclear water and the run off from the rainforest (lost of wood in the water). The $60 resort fee is not all it promises on the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website or when we called the Starwood folks to make the reservations. First, no more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frozen grapes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fruit bites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd provided (they told us that the discontinued the service); also, the s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mores were fun but only offered once while we were there (we were there 4 nights); same with the champagne. The ice tea service is still offered at noon, but only at the pool (not at the beach), and if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there right at noon, you miss it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we walked up at 12:10 and were told we had already missed it. Granted, they went and got some for us, but it seemed odd we had to ask. The fee does cover the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd beach umbrellas, bikes, boogie boards, bottled water, etc. though, which is nice. One thing to note about the service is that we ordered ice cream one night ($22 with tip and service fee) and put the bowl outside our room, in the vestibule, after we were done. The next morning we noticed it was still there and when we came back from kayaking in the Bio Bay (see below), the ice cream bowl was STILL THERE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a full 24 hours after we left it. A little strange, we thought. The next morning was when we left for the airport and we were in a bit of a rush so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice if it was still there. I would also like to call out that the BEST service the whole time was from the valet. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember his name but he was super friendly, always smiling and service oriented; and every morning would ask what we had planned for the day. One day as we loaded up our car full of stuff for snorkeling, he noticed we had a small collapsible cooler with us in which we had a few sodas. He proactively asked if he could put some ice in it for us and took it into the Plantation House to fill it up for us. SURROUNDING AREA -> As mentioned above, we rented a car. We ran the numbers and found that renting was about the same cost as arranging for other transportation from San Juan (approx $100 each way in a cab or $175 each way for car service vs $116 Hertz 4-day rental plus $90 in daily parking fees and around $20 for gas). Having a car also freed us to easily visit the surrounding area instead of feeling like we had to spend 100% of our time at the resort. Reasons you may want a car include: - Visit the near-by Ralph\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grocery store (close to where Hwy 3 and 187 meet, in a strip mall next to a Wendy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and a Walgreens) to get sunscreen, water, soda and some snacks. - Go to Fajardo to see actual clear water and for snorkeling and an evening at the Bioluminescent Bay. We highly recommend both of these - See my separate posts for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mini Boat Tours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kayaking Puerto Rico.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We made the reservations for these on our own. The concierge was the one who suggested the mini boat snorkeling but said we should call on that on our own, which we did. The concierge was then going to do the Bio Bay reservations for us but due to several factors they were unable to secure this, and so when we found out that the same company who does the mini boats also does the bio bay, and offered us a discount to book them together on-site, we just went ahead and did that. By the way, we drove ourselves and it was easy to find both locations; of course having our GPS helped a lot. - Visit Old San Juan. Go up highway 66 and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quick 30 minute trip past the airport to Old San Juan. The concierge directed us where to park and provided suggestions on where to walk and what to see. Thank goodness! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if we could have gotten to the parking garage without the concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s directions as San Juan is CRAZY busy! We went on a Sunday night at the concierge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendation because that is the night that families converge on San Juan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was fun to see locals dancing to traditional music near the old wall and to experience real Puerto Rican street food. - Eat at the Luquillo Kiosks, a collection of 60 beach-side eateries ranging from basic road-side fried food to gourmet meals. These are just 15 minutes from the St Regis along Hwy 3. This is where you get to dive into the Puerto Rican culture with the locals while experiencing awesome food. We ate there 3 times, at El Jefe Burgers (#12), La Parilla (#2), and Osso Bucco (#29). This is definitely a local hotspot on weekend nights. Look for locals arriving on horseback! Overall, we were pleased with our selection of this resort and our time in Puerto Rico, although we wish the beach had been nicer and that we had been upgraded to a suite for the full St Regis experience. If we return to Puerto Rico, we would pick a different resort, due mainly to the beach.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Syracuse, New York", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Property\u201d", "Author": "kgclark", "ReviewID": "UR118635354", "Content": "Spectacular hotel.

Positives: The rooms at the hotel are extremely nice and very large. We had a beachfront suite and it was one of the nicest rooms I've ever had. I don't think anyone would be disappointed in the room, regardless of your expectations. The grounds around the hotel were very well kept and it makes you feel like you are in your own private jungle retreat. The quality of the food and drinks were very good and we liked everything we tried. We loved Fern and would highly recommend eating here. The food wasn't too pricey, but drinks were expensive, even by resort standards ($22 with tax and service fee for all the mixed drinks). I played golf one morning and the course had a really nice layout. The par 3s were all a little too short, and some seemed like they were just squeezed into the course, but overall it was a very nice, fun course that I would recommend to any golfers. Our room was in the building next to the plantation house (the main building) so it was very convenient to everything. I would recommend asking to be in a room close to the main building. Negatives: Our biggest complaint during the trip was the slow service for just about everything. The staff was always very friendly and helpful, but it just took WAY too long for them to do anything. Ordering coffee in the morning took 45 minutes to an hour each day. By the pool, the server would only come by once every half hour or so and the morning we left it took 35 minutes for the bellman to come to the room to get our luggage. Our room wasn't ready until 4:30pm when we arrived on a Monday and we often had to call to have our room serviced. Most days it wasn't serviced until 5 or 6pm. These are just a couple examples, but almost everything was too slow and it became a joke among us by the end of our trip. The other big complaint we had was that there was no adult pool. There were lots of children at the hotel, which was totally fine except by the pool. The pool wasn't crowded, but there was at least one loud family in each area of the pool. Going forward, I really hope the hotel designates one of the areas as an adult pool. Then some miscellaneous notes. The beach is nice, but it didn't look anything like the pictures on the website. The sand was dark brown, and there was a fair amount of sea weed and sticks on the beach. The water was also more of a brown color. It may just be a little extra muddy during this time of the year, but it was definitely not anything close to a bright blue-green. Also there aren't really any \"beachfront\" rooms. The closest rooms are still probably 40-50 yards from the beach and there are lots of trees in between the room and the ocean. We were on the first floor, so maybe the second floor has an unobstructed view, but our room did not. Overall, the hotel was so beautiful and the flight from the US was so easy that we will definitely try it again and hope for some changes. I would just set your expectations ahead of time and you should have a great time.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBest Place to Stay in Puerto Rico\u201d", "Author": "Chi_LonTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR118422446", "Content": "We stayed there in May 2011 and had a very pleasant experience.

To rent a car is not really that cheap, the cheapest rate is about $35 per day + insurance $30 per day + St Regis daily parking $22 + fees to return back to airport + some other fees = $90-100 per day for KIA! If you really need to get out of the resort rent a car, but for a short stay the car is not necessary. I also did not like the old San Juan, populated with cruise ship people, just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t my thing. Positives: drinks at Fern and lobby are expensive, but great. I did not mind spending $22 for a ginger margarita or cucumber martini. Room is comfortable and the setting is beautiful. Fern food is good, but not phenomenal. Service was good, very good everywhere in a resort. The pool setting is nice and we enjoyed late night swimming. I also liked the privacy the resort allows. Overall I would go back for the privacy and the location. I also would like to note lobby bartenders make the best drinks! Negatives: The beach was not clean; I was disappointed that the beach was not cleaned thru the day. Beach chairs look faded. Seagrapes food is just ok (could be better), drinks are not worth the price there, $18-22 for a smoothie made from a frozen carton product\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 St Regis could not get fresh fruits? Also, Pina Colada was the worst (Seagrapes restaurant) I had in years, also probably some frozen carton. I was surprised to see dirty light fixture to the room entrance, I thought it was obvious to see. Food was good in Fern, not phenomenal, I liked small portions and consistent quality, but was annoyed hearing Jean George at every meal. If Fern is so highly acclaimed and considered 5* establishment then tables should NOT be made from laminated wood, cheap table settings, fake candles and so on.

The rooms are most definitely pricey, but, you get what you pay for. The property is gorgeous and the staff is very well trained to not disappoint! PROS: - The property is beautiful and the attention to detail is exquisite. The staff is very well trained to greet every guest in the same manner. Nobody is pretentious. - The rooms are GORGEOUS and offer every possible amenity. First class, all the way! - Jean Georges restaurant is FABULOUS! And, does not disappoint. A bit, pricey, yes. But, I'm willing to pay the price for EXCELLENT food and service! CONS: - We also smelled the mildew/mold all around the property. Fortunately, our room was on a top floor and we did not smell it so much in our room, but, it was so bad in the elevator, I left with a severe allegoric reaction, after one night. - The air conditioning unit in our room was soooo loud, I kept thinking there was a massive storm outside our window. I'd get up to look outside and the trees weren't even moving. I didn't sleep a wink, that night. :( - Right after we checked into our room, the staff knocked on our door to take in all of the outdoor deck cushions, because a hurricane was coming two days later. Turned out, the hurricane was downgraded and never even came near the island. A bit to pre-cautious. - Same thing happened at the pool. They packed up and locked down all of the outdoor furniture equipment and when we asked to have a chase put out, we received attitude and were directed to a corner where they started pulling at chase lounges, to accommodate every one, without making more work for themselves. - We dinned at Jean Georges restaurant, Fern, for both dinner and breakfast. It was not cheap! But, the food did NOT disappoint! Con - when we arrived for breakfast, all of the windows/views were blocked with armoires, again, preparing for the storm, that never happened. They could have positioned the armoires, in place, to move in two seconds, upon the first rain drop. I certainly am all for being prepared, in advance. But, 48 hours in advance, for a storm that never hit the island, is a bit excessive. And, for the price of a room, that is a major CON. It doesn't matter if you have discretionary income or you are spending every last dime in your wallet or on credit, at $695/night, every guest should be pampered and treated to the fine luxuries this resort has to offer.

No. But, I give this resort a lot of thumbs down for many service-related aspects. As a St. Regis resort, I expect remarkable, above-average service. What we experienced was below-average on many occasions. Here is a list of pros and cons from our stay: PROS - The grounds/landscaping was very lovely - you would not have known Hurricane Irene had just passed through. Very lush and colorful surrounding the rooms, pool and other facilities. They have a raised wooden walkway that winds from the main house to all of the rooms, which is nicely-lit at night and has music playing. They have a nature trail on the property that's great for running/walking, too. - We stayed in a Garden room (building 900) and I would actually recommend this area/type over a more expensive one. From what I saw, there are not really any rooms right on the beach, and our room was very cool to the pool and main house. - The beach area had a great variety of 'activities' - two bocce ball courts, crouqet, and a variety of beach items you could check out from the beach shack. - The pool area is nicely laid out. There are several 'parts' of the pool with varying depths, shade, and sitting areas. - Quiet, clean beach area. - The bathrooms have some nice features - nice rain showerhead and a tv in the mirror - The main house's interior design is beautiful and has a lovely lawn that extends from the back outdoor sitting area to the beach. The workout facility has nice equipment, an exercise room, towels, headphones, a fridge full of bottled water, and a nice, cool temperature. - The food from Fern at dinner (dinner specifically) was excellent. Our favorite are the blistered shishito peppers and the avocado pizza appetizer. (Breakfast at the Fern was very overpriced and bland.) - The bartenders at the main house and the pool bar were all very nice and conversational - it was a pleasure visiting with them. - Great pizzas at the pool bar/restaurant. All the food is pricey there, but these are worth it. CONS - Room service was basically non-existent. We were there for 4 days and they never collected or replaced our used glasses. Not once. We ended up having to wash our own glasses and re-use them. We had to hide our empty shampoo/conditioner bottles in order to have them replaced. It was clear that our counters weren't thoroughly wiped down because none of our items had moved a millimeter from where we'd placed them. - The room smelled very musty upon arrival. It was better after the 2nd day (either b/c we got used to it or because we had the A/C blasting), but not even candles lit or available to even try to address the smell. The drawers in the closest were lined w/ paper but very sloppy, the paper was too big to even fit. Uncomfortable, large pillows. Hard bed (where's the W bed when you need it. - No coordination between the concierge and room service. Most nice places know when you have made a reservation for dinner (we did every night) and schedule the room service to come by then. Every night our room service person would come by when we were showering. I expect 5-star resorts to have some collaboration between departments. - Overpriced food at the pool bar/restaurant. I do expect prices at a St. Regis to be high, but the pricing strategy was a bit of a rip-off (everything on the menu, no matter the ingredients used, were all about the same price). Some food was worth the premium prices (i.e. the pizzas were excellent), but others were sub-par. - The pool bar closes way too early - 5pm if I remember correctly. There were always so many people around when they were yelling last call. Not only was it disruptive to anyone having a nice afternoon in the pool, but it was also disappointing not having a good after dinner hang out spot to enjoy with a cocktail. - I was very disappointed that when I called ahead of our trip and specifically asked if there were any events/activities going on at the resort that the answer was 'no'. (We scheduled a kayak trip for Saturday night.) Come to find out that we booked our kayak outing on the night they were doing a Champagne and S'Mores event. I'm sure it was lovely...too bad we missed out. - Expensive pool bar drinks - a top shelf margarita costs $18, as an example. - None of the doors at the women's bathroom in the pool area would latch shut.

Unfortunately, we didn't make it back before the storm and got stranded in Orlando, but the 2 days we had at the St. Regis were fantastic. Everything about this property was beautiful, from the scenery we passed on a regular basis, to the surroundings at the pool, and of course the rooms. We were upgraded to a Deluxe King Room which had an balcony with a view, and a beautiful room with very comfy bed, walk-in closet, nice wet-bar area, and of course huge bathroom with double vanities, rain shower, and separate nice and deep tub. The service was also great, though the food and drinks were a bit pricey (as NYers, we're used to prices like this in the high-end restaurants but this was a bit more than I would have expected even at a resort property). Nevertheless, we had lunch at Seagrapes and breakfast the next day at Fern. The lunch at Seagrapes was pretty good (the shrimp in the jumbo shrimp cocktail really are JUMBO) and the drinks were very nice. If we had a chance to stay longer, we probably would have gone to a store to stock up on some basic items and stored them in the fridge. The property is wonderful, with lots of different plants and trees and wildlife to surround you - overall creating a very natural and serene environment. And of course, there's not enough to say about the service. Especially the concierge, Denise, sat with us for a while and helped us figure out our options for how to spend our one full day there (Friday) - we ended up exploring Old San Juan because El Yunque was closed after the hurricane. Which brings me to a few tips for the trip: 1. Definitely rent a car. Taxi's are expensive and there's no other way to get around because the resort is far from town and really far from anything else as well. Car rentals are cheap and totally worth it! 2. Our second night there (Friday), after exploring Old San Juan (which I recommend - it's a cute little town and definitely has character) we decided to go with the recommendations we read here and based on what our concierge recommended and we went to Marmalade for dinner. Conclusion - there are absolutely not enough words to describe this phenomenal eating experience. It was pure heaven (again, as NYers, we're used to some of the best food in the world and we both put this place in our top 3 culinary experiences EVER). The decor was beautiful, the drinks were phenomenal (Ted, the bartender, really knows what he's doing and if you don't like it, he'll make you another one for no charge. The Plum Sake martini had me happy for the whole night), and the food was out of this world (my BF described it as 'every dish gushes with overwhelming happiness and heaven). We ordered the 5 course tasting menu and were pretty full by the end of the night, but they do a good job with portion size so you are able to at least try each course. We had to end our meal early because of flight reasons, but we both decided that we would happily come back to Puerto Rico for an overnight trip just to be able to go to this restaurant again.

If you are looking for a secluded resort with immaculate rooms and grounds, and very friendly service, then look no further. Overall, we placed it at or near the top of the list for our family vacations. Some specifics: Pros: * The hotel: Driving into the St. Regis facility gives you a great sense of things to come: lush, tropical landscape, the Jones golf course, the Plantation House -- all gorgeous. The rooms are huge and well appointed. Bathrooms are as grand as other reviews state. We had an oceanfront room, ground level and next to the Plantation House and the pool, which was terrific. Very convenient. * The staff: All very friendly and accomodating. Big kudos to Pedro, our waiter at Seagrass, and Xavier at the front. Everyone was friendly, knowledgable and helpful. The beach: Bahia is immaculate. Yes, the waves are choppy and the water isn't Bahamas blue, but my wife and kids still enjoyed body surfing for hours. * The golf course: A challenging Trent Jones course. The greens had just been aerated and sanded, which meant my round was more challenging than for most, but I could still appreciate it. Pricey, but worth the experience. Cons: * Meal prices: The restaurants are all good, but probably not deserving of the resort prices. Our dinner entrees at Fern were disappointing (undercooked salmon), but breakfast was very good. Molasses for dinner was better - excellent mofongo --but then it was closed for two days due to the slow season. Seagrass, the casual poolside restaurant, was consistently the best but still tough to stomach $100+ for a casual lunch for 4. While we wouldn't stay there, try Palio at the Rio Mar resort for dinner. Same resort prices, but excellent Italian food. For better, cheaper PR cuisine, try the Kiosks in Luquillo -- La Parilla was the best! * Meal service: Despite the overall excellent service, meal service was consistently sloooooow. We were on vacation, and in no rush, but -- since it is the low season and the resort was relatively empty -- we expected our meals in a reasonable timeframe. Not sure if this was due to low staffing, but be prepared to wait. Overall: It's clear from the reviews on TA that word is starting to get out about this place. The fact that it has only been open since Nov 2010 contributes both positives (new, immaculate) and negatives (a few service kinks). I expect that they will be put to the test when the high season begins and more people flock to the resort.

The property is located on the edge of crystal clear water in a rainforest setting. A board walk carries you about 1 ft. above the floor of the rain forest to the rooms. - Great workout room. SPG properties are known for outstanding workout facilities, and this property is no different with a Subzero filled with water and apples for after the workout. - Rooms are on par with other St. Regis properties: very nice. The bathrooms are large and there are large private balconies. Cons: - We were very dissatisfied with the restaurants. We dined at Molasses and both our meals were inedible from too much salt, necessitating an after dinner meal. Fern actually had edible food, but unfortunately the selection was limited. - We were dissatisfied with the service. Our room was not cleaned any of the nights we stayed in the hotel without a call. On one occasion, we left the \"Please Makeup Room\" light on from 10 am to 4 pm to return with our room still in need of service. We called to ask for service, left for dinner, and returned to simply find towels. Room service trays would remain outside our door for an entire day, and spilled coffee in the hall way was never cleaned. - We were treated like second class citizens. For our dinner at Molasses, no one would give us directions to the restaurant (\"you have to wait for a cart\", which is not true, it's a five minute walk along the beach) so we called for a cart. We called four times over two hours but no cart ever arrived. We were informed that Carmelo Anthony was at the property and all carts and service were being directed towards his group (not to mention that they shut down Fern that night, so Molasses was the only on-site option). - The property is also a good distance from San Juan (30 minutes) and located on a road that is extremely dangerous to drive (the road has no lines, is almost exactly 2 car widths, and you need to veer off the road to dodge the locals driving 50 mph right at you in a game of chicken).

This property is simply beautiful, nestled on Bahia Beach which is very secluded. This St. Regis property has an understated elegance without ever feeling stuffy. It is a small plantation style resort which during the off season, was not crowded and you really get fabulous service and attention! The room is nicely decorated and very large, the suites (which we were upgraded to) was exceptional. The food at the resort is not cheap but it was consistently very good, especially Fern. NYC style restaurant and a nice pre fix menu . The staff was wonderful, friendly and very attentive throughout our stay. Some suggestions for travelers: We used toursanjuan.com to get a car service to the hotel, excellent service with private luxury transfers that are half the rate of what the St. Regis charges. Stop at Ralph's grocery store and stock up some food/drink especiallly if you have a family. Take advantage of what the resort has to offer, rent the bikes and tour the extensive property. Schedule a nature tour with the marine biologist. Rent a boat if available at the Boat House, Take advantage of the driving range. All listed above are free. The bar is a great option to get a light meal and a change of atmosphere to dine. A few suggestions for the hotel: Seagrapes would be nice to have open for breakfast as it is more casual than Fern and would give people another option in the morning. The gift store could be upgraded and have more to offer. Pool service could be improved, it was not crowded and we needed to find someone to place a drink order.

I have heard a lot of good things from my colleagues who have stayed with you so I knew I will have a good time, but after my stay I can tell you that words cannot describe the experience and all my expectations were highly exceeded. The property itself is so beautiful and luxurious but the service is just unbelievable. Never ever have I been treated better in my life. I honestly have tears in my eyes writing this letter, thinking about my stay and your staff. I was welcomed by Carlos upon my arrival.

Matta (?) at the bar- I came in one day for lunch before noon and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize the bar was not open yet, Matta insisted on providing lunch for me and we had a wonderful chat. Elvis at the bar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very professional and caring. One day I mentioned I had trouble sleeping and he offered to make me a tea to help me sleep. I thought it was very nice and attentive. Dianne (?) at the boutique - I came in right when she was opening up and she made me feel like she is truly happy to see me, quick encounter but left a memorable impression. Heidi who welcomed me every day for breakfast, so nice and friendly and Salvador! So so so wonderful! He talked to me every day about how my stay is, always with a smile. Jonathan at the pool and all the girls there-one time I was passing by and mentioned I may come back and when I returned, Jonathan had a chaise lounge ready for me. Ludwig was also always taking care of me, I stepped into a gum and he got it off my foot (which I definitely did not expect him to do), he kept looking after me, making sure I was drinking enough water and that I have everything I need. All the staff-and I really mean every single person I would come across to-would constantly ask if I have everything I need and every question/request I had was taken care of immediately with a smile and calm, relaxed and friendly attitude. I wanted to mentioned that I spoke to another guest who stayed with her parents for 10 days and she said she hurt her knee and the butler (do not know the name) went at midnight to a pharmacy to get her an ice pack. She said she feels like every single employee is happy to be working there and is pleased to take care of the guests. Mr. Berger, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for the best 5 days and if any of your employees would ever need anything, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d do everything possible I could, to help them.

However, small details need serious work to become an elite property. Bicycles available to guess do not work and I recommend extreme caution is taken before getting on one. My wife and I took a couple and one broke 10 minutes into the ride. We had to go back to the facilities to get another one. We were back 15 minutes after once again as the replacement also broke. This time it was the device holding the infant seats. We were so lucky nothing happened to our kids. Onviously we decided not to ride anymore. State of the art technology is used throughout the resort. For instance you can set your room to show you busy / occupied. Howevr, somehow front desk keep calling your room during kid napping time. We had the same situation twice on the road. Looks like they are not using their own technology to allow guess privacy and comfort. A reservation at Fern was canceled without any prior warning.

We were a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews regarding service, but our fears were unfounded. We had a wonderful, relaxing vacation in this beautiful resort. Here are the details: Getting there - There are many reviews that talked about how confusing and difficult it was to find the resort. We took the scenic beach route (PR 187) from the resort rather than the main highway route (PR-26 / PR 3), and we found it pretty easy to get to. Just make sure that you look for two large bronze leaves off the main road, as it can sneak up on you quickly. The drive there was gorgeous, following the beaches and water for most of the trip. We stopped by one of the many food shacks along the road and ate some great local snacky food. The resort is about 30-40 minutes away from San Juan and is in a very secluded part of Puerto Rico, which is exactly what we wanted. You will need a car, however, if you plan on going out of the hotel even once, as taxis and hotel transportation can be very expensive. The resort - Once we made it to the resort, we stopped by the gate and the security attendant took our names and told us how to get to the check-in desk. The resort grounds are absolutely beautiful and very vast. The drive from the main gate to the lobby must be at least a mile or more, so that will give you an idea of how large the total property is. The landscape is lush, green, and very beautiful. When we got to the lobby, the staff was very friendly and would not let us do anything. We were whisked away to the check-in desk, which is exactly what it sounds like. There is no check in area. Instead, you sit in front of one of two desks where someone checks you in and goes over the details of your stay. We were offered cold rum punch while we waited, which was delicious. They upgraded us to a suite, which was beautiful (more on that later). You can either walk down a series of flora-covered boardwalks and sidewalks, or you can have the staff take you around in golf carts. We opted for the golf carts for the first trip to the room because we did not know how far it would be. Within 5 minutes of check-in, we were carted away to our room. The room - The hotel is broken out into a series of \"casas\", and we were in one called Casa Sanctuario. It was aptly named, as it was nestled amidst a plethora of foliage and the only sounds we heard during our entire stay were those of the coqui frogs whistling at night, and the ocassional bird that would visit our balcony. Our suite was quite large, although I'm not sure about the square feet. We had a huge balcony with a large patio furniture set, which was great for eating breakfast or drinking coffee. The king bed was very comfortable, the TV was huge, although we did not watch it at all. The bathroom was luxurious, as well as enormous. I am sure there have been many hotel rooms I have stated at that were not as big as this bathroom.. There was a double sink, a huge shower set with a rainshower as well as a wall shower system, a deep soaking tub that we sadly did not get to try out, and a separate, closed-off toilet area. It had all the upscale amenities one would expect from a brand that espouses luxury. The pool and beach - The pool was not crowded at all during our stay there. There were plenty of areas that provide a feeling of being secluded because of the way they have designed it. The lounge chairs were very comfortable and the water was a perfect temperature. The beach was beautiful and pretty much stretched from horizon to horizon, giving you the feeling you are truly in the middle of nowhere, which, of course, you are. The service - This is the area that has received the most negative comments about this resort. However, we found the service to be impeccable. We never had to wait long for anything that we asked for. The only exception was at the pool, where service tended to be slow. However, we were at the pool to relax, not to rush through things, so we did not find this very bothersome. Everyone was incredibly friendly and warm, from the butlers you spoke with on the phone to the custodial staff you would see ocassionally. They gave me a feeling that they genuinely cared about their guests and want to do what they can to make life easier for us. Every time they pulled up our car to go out of the resort, they would make sure that they gave us two bottles of cold water before we left. Whenever I requested something, the response was always \"but of course Mr. Vasavda\". There were a few instances of service that really stood out to me and are indicative of the type of service one can expect here. We told the staff that we were there to celebrate our 10th anniversary. On the day of our anniversary itself, upon coming home in the evening from dinner, we saw that they had left chocolates and a bottle of red wine for us, along with a hand written and very thoughtful letter from one of the butlers. The day before our anniversary, I had also mentioned to the butler staff that I wanted to do something nice for my wife for our anniversary, but for the day after our anniversary because we would be too full. We decided on getting some chocolate covered strawberries. When we came home the next day after our anniversary, we saw chocolate covered strawberries along with a \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate, and a letter saying the things I wanted it to stay. However, they also had given us a bucket of ice and yet another bottle of wine (white this time). Despite originally stating that there would be a charge for the strawberries, they never charged us for them, nor for the wine. The pool staff, upon learning it was our anniversary, would not let me go back to my room without giving us two glasses of champagne on the house. They truly went above and beyond to make our anniversary memorable. The food - We only ate lunch at Molasses once and lunch poolside a couple of times. The food was very expensive, but at least it was good. The drinks were very very expensive ($18-$20 for most cockatils), but also were very good. We did not eat at Fern, their signature gourmet restaurant as we prefer to experience local food when we are on vacation. Overall, we had a very memorable, romantic, luxurious, and relaxing trip at this resort, in no small part to the wonderful staff. I can't wait to go back with the kids sometime in the future.

Drinks were about $20 and not particularly strong nor delish, same with the food. After 5pm, Seagrapes (the eatery by the pool) closes so you're left with uber-fancy Fern or lackluster yet pricey Molasses to choose from. Our advice? Stop at the Ralphs grocery on the way in and pick up some booze and snacks. Another con is the wonky AC that wouldn't behave, so we just left it off all night. Plus, there is NOTHING to do after sunset, so bring some DVDs (not Bluray, they don't play) or drop $17 on an OnDemand movie.

We started to get a little wary once reviews started coming in, especially those about the service. The prices, we expected- after all, it is a St. Regis. But we weren't sure what to expect along the lines of service. We honestly could not have been more pleasantly surprised. I am not sure what kind of people are finding the service there unacceptable, but we thought it was the best we had experienced anywhere (and we travel often!). Every person we came into contact with was polite, attentive, and extremely helpful. Above all, they were swift. They made us feel welcome and truly at home in Puerto Rico, and helped make our stay even better with their willingness to give suggestions when asked what to do and where to eat. It was said to say goodbye to them, especially the wonderful people in the butler and valet services. The rooms are beautiful. Since the resort is still so new, everything is in great shape. And the bathrooms are massive- I've never seen a shower area so large! The grounds themselves are absolutely stunning. The property is extensive, and beautiful. Some reviewers complained that it is isolated, but we actually found it to be the perfect \"base\" for us- it was 20 minutes to the rainforest, 30 minutes to San Juan, 20 minutes to Fajardo- basically in the middle of all the locations we needed to travel to during our weeklong stay. I will say, if you have intentions of doing things outside of the resort- rent a car. Yes you have to pay valet charges, but driving in Puerto Rico is very easy and the hotel always provides excellent directions to all your locations if you don't have a GPS with you. Plus, it will save you a ton of money on taxis/meals by being able to eat off the resort. Some helpful tips for your stay: 1. Like I said, rent a car. It will allow you to truly enjoy your time there by eating locally and experiencing the sites that are close to the resort (there are many!) 2. Stop at Ralphs. The grocery store is right before the turn you make to go to the resort. The rooms have pretty decent sized mini-fridges; we stocked up on sandwich supplies, milk, cereal, fruit, juice, and snacks (along with wine) on our way in. Best thing we did all week! Don't worry about water bottles though; they give them out like candy 24/7 at the resort to keep everyone hydrated (which is wonderful!) 4. Go to the rainforest- El Yunque rainforest is less than 30 minutes from the resort, and it is completely free as long as you bypass the visitor center (they charge $3 a person, but you don't have to stop there unless you want to look around a see a video/get maps). The hikes are great, user-friendly, and they have great waterfalls throughout. Definitely a fun experience! 5. Eat at Marmalade- a restaurant in Old San Juan. We went a few hours early to see the fort/walk the streets which made for a great evening as Old San Juan is very charming (and safe thanks to police there for cruise visitors!). It is one of the best restaurants in the city for a reason. You'll get an amazing meal and still pay less than you would at the resort. Can't say enough good things about that place! 6. Visit Culebra- their flamenco beach is ranked #2 in the world. You can get there from Fajardo which is about 30 minutes from the hotel. You can either take a ferry for less than $5 a person (2 hour ride) or a plan for $40 a person (less than 30 minutes). We enjoyed the flight for the beautiful view and lack of seasickness, but know others who took the ferry without a problem. Just keep an eye on the clock because it only runs a few times a day and if you miss it... you're out of luck. 7. Do the kayaking BioBay tour. Yes, glowing plankton in a bay sounds completely nerdy. But it was honestly one of the most amazing things we have ever done. Kayaking through the mangrove forest alone was pretty incredible, but seeing the water glowing around you at night is truly magical. We used Kayaking Puerto Rico for our trip and had a great time; I recommend doing the 6:30 tour so you get the best of both light and dark in your trip (otherwise you'll never see the mangroves well!) Trust me, you don't want to miss it! Overall, we had a fantastic trip and loved every day that we got to spend at the St. Regis.

My wife and I have been to many 5 star high end resorts. The St Regis facilities are beautiful and first rate. Fabulous beach, great pool. Rooms are great. Spa is very good. Gym is large and nice. Restaurants all pretty. The amenities are all there. The service at this place is the pits. This place charges top dollar, but does not deliver. Every aspect of the resort outside of the physical plant is sub par. They nickel and dime you every minute. Starts with daily resort fee of 60 bucks/day. At this price point-900-1300 bucks per night, just charge another 60 bucks and not call it a resort fee. But jeez, another $420 just to use the chairs and beach?? At the bar the drinks are pricey, top shelf cost me $23 for a drink. BUT they measure the booze in a shot glass as they make it. ( a pet peeve of mine- just pour a nice drink). car services are prohibitive and make you not want to leave and explore. they even charge you to park if you rent a car. Service is abhorable. my room phone did not work, they didnt fix it. Air conditioning is on a motion detector so at night it gets hot. you can disable it but you have to call. made the call first day, and it took 2 days before they got it right. I clogged the toilet early in the am, called to have that taken care of. left for the day, and had some guests come by and told them to use my room to shower before dinner while i was at the spa. I get a call from my guests that my toilet was clogged....very embarrassing, and the worst thing was the room was cleaned and made up. Cleaning crew actually came in and ignored a clogged toilet. Irate I went to the manager who agreed it was unacceptable, and offered to comp me a night. at check out that guy was no where and there was no indication of the arrangement, and despite my arguement with them they charged me and I got no comp. Wait staff seldom comes around at the pool you have to get up to order. You have to adjust your own umbrellas etc cause they are rarely around and if they see you doing it yourself ....let you. This place is no 4 seasons or One and Only although they are priced in that range or even higher. At the spa, no male attendant at any time i was there in the locker facility. I was scheduled every day for a week in the spa. Turn down service was requested for after 7pm while i go to dinner. Would come back from the pool after the day at 6 and the room was already turned down. took 3 days for them to get it right. This resort was as pricey as it gets, which I have no issue with, BUT at least deliver the service that ALL the other fine hotels and resorts deliver. I had a great time with my wife, cause the place is so close to NY, easy plane ride, etc. The weather was great. The food was good, although they dont have enough choices. You must leave the resort a few times, and any ride out is at least 60 bucks, and if you want a private car forget it. I would suggest that at this price point one should go else where. Also part of my reservation included a room upgrade. Of course they told me that there was nothing else available. Resort was far from full. Additionally on plane ride out I spoke to a couple who arrived on my inbound plane etc. They booked a King bed in the same room I had. They checked in after I did and were told there were no rooms with a King at that type. I must have gotten the last one. They were put into a suite, but charged for the room upgrade, and told it was pay for the suite or take the room with 2 queens. This meant there was a room upgrade available for me, they didnt offer it and lied. Had they given me my upgrade the other couple would have had their room with a King. And can you imagine not having the requested accommodation, and told you had to pay for the upgrade. You go on a 10-15 thousand dollar/ weeks vacation and cant sleep in the same bed with your wife, or you have to pay 300 bucks/night extra to have that pleasure all cause they ran out of the room.

Vacation rental: We rented two beautiful apartments from a company co-marketed with the St. Regis. We didn't realize that they were owned and operated by a different company than the hotel. One family had to cancel a few days before our expected arrival due to serious illness. The rental manager (Jarida Encarnacion) insisted that we pay at least three days (over 1K). Also some of the prices are not apparent, e.g., golf cart rental fee; we thought it came free with the apartment.

Second, none of the staff could recommend anything to do off the property. While I understand wanting guests to spend as much time and money on the property, it was somewhat ridiculous. Third, the service at Fern was equally unimpressive. Our waiter abandoned us halfway through the (mediocre) meal and none of the replacement waiters ever asked if we needed anything, or whether we were enjoying the meal. Fourth, the wait service at the pool was unbelievably bad. I had to hunt down the waitress to order a drink. We also ordered water, which never came. All in all, a poor value proposition.

However, the service for a 5-star resort was inexusibly poor and worse- inattentive. Sadly the list of service hiccups is much longer than the positives. We traveled in mid-May to the St. Regis to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday for a long weekend. Prior to arriving, I had a lot of e-mail back in forth with staff, which was great- until it wasn't. I happened to call the hotel the Weds prior to our Fri arrival- only to find that nothing I had filled out on my pre-arrival form was completed (no car service, no restaurant reservations, no spa times, no cupcakes for my husband, etc.) That day the conceirge kindly took care of things, but had I not called... I am not sure what would have happened when I had put so much into surprising my husband. We arrived at the lovely property but had to wait almost 20 minutes to check in- just sittting in the lobby. The room was gorgeous and big, especially the bathroom. We were on the ground floor facing the pool area, but shielded by lovely tall tropical gardens. The room and patio were absolutely great! We had breakfast out there every morning- with no issues. I had set up Fern for my husband's birthday dinner. However, the service was inattentive at best. We saw a party of 8 walk out since our server had 1/2 of the restaurant to cover. The food was delicious- but the service was so bad that we left before dessert- on his birthday- no less! The pool area is lovely and there is plenty of seating, again the issues were no food or drink service. I saw some free cold drink samples come around at one point, but they ran out before they got to us and they never re-appeared. Now onto the spa... again lovely space, good massages, poor service. We booked the 'Honeymoon Package' in the couples villa- however, that simply entailed getting your massage there. No use of the patio or hot tub- this was not accurately reflected in the services description. I was told we could book more time there if we paid for it. Included in the package was lunch (which we again had to wait 20+ minutes for them to set up- which they knew when our services were ending (yoga session)), but since it was raining they set it up back in the villa for us- but at that point with the rain- there wasn't much point. Last gripe with the service was as we were departing, none of the 4-5 people at the entry could find/go get our luggage which was in storage despite repeated requests and the car service waiting for us. I had to track down Anthony, who dropped it off, to find it for us. The only bright spots in our service experience were: the conceirge, Molasses- we had an amazing waiter- attentive- helpful- and delicious food and Anthony, bellman/golf cart driver- welcoming and informative, room service was also great- I loved this pulled prok sliders at Molasses and with a bit of an extra wait- they brought them to me- yummy! The grounds are beautiful and the food is delicous. But the service left much to be desired.

First off the resort and its grounds are awesome, very rainforest. The rooms are great, huge and very nice. I would say that the rooms are the major selling point for this resort. We thought the service was very good and we never really had a problem. The only time we even came close to service problems would be a the restaurants and timely service, but we were on vacation and this is just island time. We did take numerous pointers from people and have some tips of our own. First off if you are traveling to this resort expecting PR to be a typical Caribbean island, you will be disappointed. The beach is very lackluster and the water looks more like Galveston than a Caribbean island. If I had one key complaint it would be for the location of resort. If this resort was where the Westin is in St. Maartin it would be unbelievable. The prices are fairly typical of a high end resort and we are Starwood Gold members and stayed on points so we have no real complaints about the high room prices. For point wise it was OK but I think the other Caribbean Westin hotels are a better value for points based solely on location. The rooms and grounds were unbelievable. On the grounds we ate at the pool restaurant Seagrapes and our favorite was Molasses at the golf course. We thought it was very good and not as expensive as Fern. We also like to visit local places so we ate out a lot. Went to La Parrilla and it was OK but I wouldn't recommend. We also tried to go to Pasta y Pueblo but that place was pretty hard to find, it literally was a shack with about 5 table. We love those places but our schedule didn't let us try but I would try, the menu looked good. We did have a great meal at Ay Bonito grill in the kiosks. Highly recommend, had a great meal and the Halibut was extremely good. I would suggest getting out away from the hotel and having some meals. I played golf and the course is fun. Hardly anyone on the course so you play pretty quick. I though the pool was good and never had a problem with finding chairs etc. Almost everyone at the resort goes to the pool instead of the beach so it is by far the busiest part of the resort. Went to Old San Juan but it is about 45 minutes away and it wasn't really our thing. It is really cool old time building and the fort but has tons of tourist stuff and stores. We basically went down there to eat at Marmalade which we were told is one of the best restaurants in PR. It was great and the soup is to die for, highly recommend. We also went to the rainforest and thought it was a little overrated. The grounds at the resort are better than what we saw in the rainforest. It had some pretty views and nice waterfalls but nothing that great. It was an easy drive from the hotel so it didn't take that long. We did hike to the waterfall, about a 20 minute good pace hike to a waterfall. The waterfall on the side of the road is a larger waterfall so unless you are looking for a little exercise you can skip the hike. We did want to do the BioBay but it was all full and we didn't get to go. Heard it was pretty neat. All in all we had a very good and relaxing time. The resort was great and service was very good especially for a Caribbean hotel. I just wish they would of put this resort in a better location with pretty blue water.

The developers and the managing director were able to preserve the amazing tropical setting of a palm tree laden beautiful (and long!!!) beach with top of the line St. Regis accommodations. The beach is so long that we walked for 30 minutes and still didn't reach its end. The grounds and the golf course are immaculately maintained. From the moment that you arrive you know that you are at a very unique destination- the lobby is a gorgeous plantation style home with a very classy bar on the ground level and a top notch restaurant upstairs.

The rooms are spacious, incredibly appointed with an elegant tropical feel. Yet with a spectacular bathroom suite and a great balcony to enjoy the sounds of the ocean. The bedding and environment are so serene that you will sleep like a baby. The main pool area with its adjoining restaurant are also beautiful- again a mix of casual elegance with tropical landscaping. The gaspacho was beyond delicious and so were the bloody marys and tropical drinks. So what about the service? I saw some postings that it was substandard. I disagree. Every single employee that we interacted with was friendly, attentive and trying to make sure that we were content. If you are looking for fancy with exquisite attention to detail, you might be disappointed. It is more like relaxed, please let me make you feel at home- straight from a humble heart without pretense.

However, now that I have stayed there I understand it completely. Overall, I was left with a very negative taste in my mouth regarding the hotel, but I can see why some might enjoy. Let me give you the good and the bad. The good 1) The grounds are gorgeous. The property is brand new and the landscaping is incredible. You really feel like you are out in nature. 2) The concierge was very helpful. Joelle, I might have spelled it wrong, was really knowledgable, showed that he cared a lot and was full of good ideas about ways to spend our time. His personal touch was very much appreciated. The bad 1) Service. Honestly this was some of the worst service I have received at a hotel in a long time. I was staying for free on points, but would have gone ballastic if I had been paying. Examples. Ask for coffee to be brought to the room, told \"your room is not one that can have coffee delivered to it, that is for suites only\" However 4.5 hours later a full coffee maker shows up in our room. At the restaurant or the bar, it was like a roulette wheel for what you would get. Order a pizza day one, it has tomato sauce, the same one next day, no sauce. We ordered two of the same drinks at our table and they came out completely different. 2) A special shout out to the awful service at the Fern Restaurant - This was so bad it deserves its own category. The restaurant was half empty but we were still left standing outside for about 10 minutes. Then when the waiter made it to our table 20 mintues later the only emotion he conveyed was the look of contempt when my wife asked for tap water. The couple next to us had called a week in advance to sit outside, but somehow that was lost in the restaurant who sat them in the corner. No body ever came to check on us, nobody ever refilled \"the above water glass.\" In general I have had better service in Denny's 3) The expense of everything. A personal pizza, burger and 2 drinks that's $100. The horrible dinner descibed above $150. Nothing is free here. They even charge you for parking $22 a day (in the jungle...really is parking room at a shortage here, I have paid cheaper rates at garages in NYC). I am sure this will show up on another review, but the valet at the property gave our friend's car to the wrong person so when they went to leave...voila no car (to be fair the hotel did eventually work it out and returned their car to the airport for them...but still). 4) Paper thin walls. I am in the jungle yet all I could hear was the thumping of the bass from my neighbor's stereo. 5) Even the activities didn't occur. I was excited to attend the cigar rolling. It was something to do but yet the class never materialized. After asking about 5 people the 6 of us who showed up for the class were told the teacher was sick. 6) Its remote. There is nothing else near it. I mean nothing. So you are pretty much trapped. If you go, you MUST rent a car. It is the only way to escape. One thing I do want to mention is that there is a great little restaurant up the road in Kiosk 21 \"Ay Bonita!\" Give that place a chance. It is inexpensive, great food and the people there could not be any nicer. In summary between the attitude given and the crazy expense of the place, I just can't recommend it even though it is beautiful.

Like many others, we used points for our entire stay. If not, the cost would have been about $1k a night. I have never spent that much money for a room in my life and probably never will. So if it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for Starpoints, we most likely would be staying somewhere else. I inquired about upgrading to an ocean front room before we left. I was told it would be $100 plus tax per day, but they only had one room left and it had two queen beds. As a result, we declined. The ocean front rooms are set so far back from the ocean, unless you are on an upper floor, the extra money may not be worth it. We took the red eye from L.A. to San Juan arriving at 9:30 am. After picking up the rental car we headed to the resort. There is a toll booth on the route to the resort; some have an attendant and some do not. The unmanned booth accepts coins only, so be prepared. The charge is $1.50. The drive to the resort was nice and fairly easy. There is a lot of construction going on for the new freeway that ends by the road to the resort. Getting there is kind if tricky but if you follow the directions on their web site, you will be fine. The entrance to the resort is hard to see from the road. I initially passed it and even when I knew where it was, I continued to pass it almost every time we returned to the resort. A sign on the road would be helpful. We arrived at the resort at about noon and were told that our room was not ready, so we waited out on the patio. It was only about 10 minutes until they came and got us and took us by golf cart to our room. The room was fantastic, as good as a room could be. We ended up in a garden view room, which was behind he pool area and faced a small jungle. The room is huge, especially the shower area. We could hear the waves hitting the shoreline even though we were not near the ocean. We arrived the Saturday before Easter and I believe the hotel was sold out, yet the hotel and facilities did not feel crowded. We spent most of the time at the resort, but ventured into town a few times for sightseeing and to look for places to eat as the food on site is very expensive. If you order still water, be prepared to pay $10 for a bottle of Fiji water. We dined at Fern three times for breakfast and dinner and Seagrapes twice for lunch for convenience and because the food was excellent. Dinner at Fern was one of the best meals I have had in a long time. Breakfast was good as well, and I highly recommend the French Toast. We enjoyed the Turkey wrap at Seagrapes and it is large enough for two to share. I would highly recommend looking at the menus on line for the pricing before you go as many people have complained about the pricing in their reviews. The only two prices that shocked me was $10 bottle of Fiji water at Fern and a $18 hot dog at Seagrapes. I will admit that I saw someone order the hot dog our last day there and it looked really good. It was a foot long with lots of toppings. If I were to stay another day, I might have ordered it myself just to see what a $18 hot dog tasted like. Service at the hotel for the most part was very good. Everyone was helpful and nice. We only had a couple of issues that normally I would not even mention but since this resort is a five star resort, I will mention them here. Our first lack of service was at Fern. We had dinner reservations at 6:30 and arrived a little early. At that time, we were the only ones inside the restaurant. About five minutes later another family sat next to us. The waiter took their drink orders and gave them bread. I asked the bus boy for some bread and later had to ask the waiter again. He told me it was being baked. We finally received it just as we were finishing our appetizers. I would think that since we had reservations and were seated first that they would have had the bread ready for us. Again a minor thing but this shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have happened here. My wife was excited about getting fresh coffee delivered to the room in the mornings. She called the Butler to make the necessary arrangements and was transferred to another extension where the phone just rang and rang, no one ever answered at this extension. The last issue was when we were by the pool and wanted lunch. There was no attendant for so long, we finally walked to Seagrapes to order our lunch. When we returned, our towels had been removed by the attendant. We tried to go to the Kiosks for lunch or dinner as others have mentioned. However, every time we drove by, most or all of them were closed. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if this was due to the holidays or the owners just come in when they feel like it. Needless to say, we never ate there. We asked our bellman about it and he said the same thing, they are always closed. Overall, our stay at the resort was excellent and will hopefully return one day. Even though we did not venture out far from the resort, we did go to the Outlet Mall and the Wyndham Resort, which has very nice grounds and many restaurants. The prices for meals there seemed more reasonable. PS: To the guy that lost his cell phone, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame the resort for your stupidity!

I planned my preconference visit for the end of April and started looking at some of the reviews. To say I was nervous would be an understatement. So for those who might also be reading the reviews and getting a little nervous...no need to be. The property is fantastic and the service was great. From check-in to check-out was all that I expected it to be. So I'll try to address some of the concerns it seems folks had listed in some previous reviews. Food costs at the resort restaurants - As someone who's job it is to stay at plenty of top-rated properties, the costs of food is pretty much on par with what you would expect at a property such as this. So if you are expecting to pay $6 for a sandwich, probably not the place for you. I had breakfast in Fern (their signature restaurant) and my only issue was that the waiter didn't just automatically refill my orange juice. Yes, petty...but for the price he should have been refilling after every sip I took. One reviewer suggested going to the nearby Walmart and stocking up. Best advice I've seen on the property so far. Better yet, there is a new Ralph's open by the intersection of 187 and 3. Plenty of options for any family or individual that may want to stock up. Kids at the pool - If you're going to a resort and don't expect to see kids at the pool then you really have a problem. They even have an Iguana Club that will take your kids for the entire day. There were kids at the pool, but the pool is huge. If you need some quiet or privacy, they would gladly put the a nice chair and umbrella down on the beach for you. Or do like I did and go lay in one of their many available cabanas on the beach free of charge. I also never say any shortage of available seating around the pool. Service - This was never an issue while I was there. My butler called each day and left a message with their name and number in case I needed anything. I hardly ever ask for stuff when at a resort, so this was never an issue for me. No need to run my bath or unpack my clothes. Location - the property isn't really as isolated as folks make it seem. It does seem a little far at first, but after venturing out the first day I was there it wasn't bad at all. Once the new highway section is completed, it will take about 20 minutes off the trip from the airport. The intersection where you turn onto 187 is a mess and you will drive right pass your turn if you're not paying attention. Beach - It's a little weird seeing so much open beach and hardly anyone playing in the water. There were some folks here and there, but most people stuck to the pool. The beach was great for my morning runs. Here is the catch 22 - if you get that nice ocean breeze comign off the ocean then the water is a little rough. If there is no wind, the water is nice a calm, but that mean hot and humid on the resort. Give me the breeze and I'll just listen to the ocean. Overall I had a great experience. I was very relieved and will be traveling back to the resort for a week at the end of June. I plan on renting a car from the airport, stopping at Ralphs, and enjoying a great property with great service.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, OH", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Resort, with a few minor issues\u201d", "Author": "mglass78", "ReviewID": "UR105390494", "Content": "I stayed at the St Regis Bahia with my wife for 6 nights and we had a fantastic time.

The staff is polite and they try hard, my wife and I really liked everyone we interacted with, but they are truly learning how to be a luxury hotel with an untrained staff and it shows very clearly. A significant percent of the guests were extremely uptight couples from the NorthEast (it seems like 90% of the guests are either from NYC or Boston), and we witnessed multiple blow-ups along the lines of \"we are paying $900 per night and expect better service than this\". If you are going to have this expectation and attitude, which is completely reasonable given what you are paying and the hotel's brand, then definitely find somewhere else to stay: you are sure to be disappointed and you ruin your vacation as well be very annoying to other guests. On the other hand, if you go in with some patience and a sense of humor (and frankly just carry yourself like a nice person rather than an American colonialist) you are going to have a great time at this hotel. My wife and I have been to a number of high end resort hotels and this might the nicest one we've ever stayed at. The room are perfect (large, great balconies, amazing bathrooms), the beach and pool are wonderful, the restaurants are excellent, and the activities are really fun and mostly free. Activities (all free) include bike rentals for biking around the hotel grounds, various boats to go around the hotel's lake, tennis courts and equipment, and great walks around the hotel's bird sanctuary. My wife and I love animals and got huge kick out of the tons of iguanas and birds we saw all over the place. There is also a very nice (but not free) golf course on the property. The best restaurant is the one on the golf course, Molasses, though it's definitely better for lunch and drinks than it is for dinner. The food by the pool is solid and the drinks are great.

I have read every review on TripAdvisor since booking the trip in December and never thought to \"cancel based on the reviews here\" as others have admitted. To give you a little profile of my family - my wife and I both work for a living and this vacation was more about spending time away with our daughter in a relaxing atmosphere more than anything. We don't make 7 figures as many of the other guests clearly do, and we would not have chosen to spend $1400/night at this resort if we were not using points. The $60/day resort fee did not irk me as much as many of the other guests - primarily because the Westin St. John (where we have also stayed \"sans baby\" has a similar fee). But I guess if I was shelling out $1400 a night the $60 cherry on top would bother me as well. Additionally, we are fine with \"doing things ourselves\"- in fact it makes us uncomfortable to ask someone to unpack our bags, or come to our room and serve us coffee. We iron our own clothes, walk to get our coffee ourselves, and generally straighten our room up before we depart for the day to make it easier on housekeeping. I mention these things above because I feel like this resort gets a bad rap on this site based on service alone. Based on my everyday life, the service was great. However to the small percentage of the guests who traveled with their nannies or personal assistants, and expect to have their shirts ironed for them by someone else they may tend to ding this property, and I guess rightfully so. Now onto my review... The bad: -It is tricky to get to, and a little scary the last 5 miles. Don't be discouraged however, paradise is right around the corner. -Food /Drink prices are outrageous and the selection is limited (See Tips below). -While we did not have this problem personally, we met a few couples who complained of poor service at Fern. Apparently they only had 2 waiters working at a time (one inside, and one outside) which resulted in long waits for food. Additionally, one couple we met indicated that the first 2 bottles of wine they ordered were sold out. A restaurant of this caliber should add an addendum to the wine list to call out wines that are out of stock. -Pool umbrella's were a hot commodity. If you did not get to the pool by 8:00 to reserve your seats you would be stuck in the blistering sun for the day. For some reason they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough umbrellas to cover each pair of chairs. The Good: -Amazing Grounds. They are so expansive you really feel like you have the place for yourself - with the exception of the pool which is brewing with guests - not in a bad way, however. -Great for Kids. There were lots of children here, clearly having a great time. Pablo was especially great in talking with the kids and letting them feed the Koi in the pond at the entrance to the Plantation house. -Huge and nicely appointed rooms. We had a standard Garden View room and it was amazing. The shower alone is nearly 40 square feet. The walk in closet was great for storing our suitcases in an effort to keep our room looking tidy. We had 2 double beds which were very comfortable. The outdoor balcony was huge with a nice dining table and couch to relax on. We had a wetbar/sink in the main part of the room as well which included a SubZero mini fridge. We had no problem with the AC noise as many others have mentioned. -Friendly staff. Everyone who works at this place is happy and accommodating and greets you with a warm smile. We asked one of the bellmen what the guest to employee ratio is. He indicated there are 134 rooms at the property and a little over 800 employees. I have to guess, however, that half of those employees are gardeners. Tips: -On your way to the resort, stop at the Super Wal-Mart. Normally when you get to Route 3 you turn right to get to the resort. Instead, turn left and after about 100 yards the WalMart will be on your right. This Wal-Mart has a grocery store in it so there is no need to stop here and then stop at Ralphs as many have mentioned. We bought milk, cereal, granola bars, fruit, disposable bowls, Cheese & Crackers, Rum, Mojito mix etc here so we could have breakfast and cocktails each day on our balcony. We also bought diapers, wipes, etc for the baby. -If you are traveling with a baby, request that they deliver a highchair to your room. We did this and kept it for the week so we could feed the baby out on the balcony. They also allegedly have Diaper Genies there, but one was not available for us during our stay. -You can store cold items in the fridge in the room, however check your bill at checkout to make sure that they did not mistakenly charge you for any minibar items. We had a random $6 charge which was removed at my request. -Pick your pool spot early. Just go to the pool around 7:30-8:00am and ask one of the pool staff to reserve your chairs for you. They will document your seats and place towels on your chairs as a sign that they are reserved. -When you arrive at your room, ask the Butler for extra bottled water. It is free. He actually brought us 12 bottles so we could use it for the baby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s formula. We also brought this bottled water to the pool each day. -If you are traveling with children, a jogging stroller would probably be ideal for this property since some of the pathways to the pool are gravel and have stairs. However we recognized how hard it is to travel with a jogger so we did fine with our MacLaren Triumph umbrella stroller. -Rent a Car \u00e2\u20ac\u201c From what we heard dinner at Fern and Molasses gets old (and expensive) very quickly. -Go to Luquillo for dinner! We spent 5 nights at the St. Regis. 2 nights we ordered room service which was ok. The other 3 nights we drove into Luquillo for dinner and had meals that were much better than our room service and much cheaper. We ate twice at Pasta Y Pueblo which was amazing food in an amazing setting. Read the reviews of it on TripAdvisor. On Tuesday night we ate at Boardriders Rum Shack & Grill, which is a block down the beach from Pasta Y Pueblo. For these three meals (6 entrees, 2 appetizers, 1 dessert, and 8 alcoholic drinks) we spent less than $150 total including tip. This is what a single meal at Fern would cost for 1 person! -Enjoy the plantation house in the morning! From 6:30am to 10:30 am they have Coffee and Tea set up on the bar for free. 7am\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the Plantation house with my daughter were some of my most memorable experiences of the trip. There was hardly anyone in there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was if we had the place all to ourselves. We seemed to be the only ones who took advantage of the comfortable couches and USA Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but then again, our baby is an early riser. -If you want to visit Old San Juan, I would not recommend leaving the resort to visit for a day or evening. It can be a long trip, especially if you are driving during the week at rush hour. We flew in a day early and spent 1 night at a hotel in Old San Juan prior to going to the St Regis. That way we could enjoy OSJ for a day and a half without worrying about going back and forth in a single day. Overall this is a fantastic resort, with wonderful grounds, and great people. We were truly able to kick back and relax for 6 days in luxury.

We had high expectations, as I researched this resort and read all of the reviews. Our expectations were definitely met. We used our Startwood points to get an oceanfront suite. So glad we did! From the moment we walked in, we felt like we had a home, not a hotel room. The rooms were decorated in subtle, neutral tones. The bathroom was heaven. My favorite walk-in shower ever! And you must use the soaking tub, at least once. The only complaint...the dim lighting in the bathroom. There is a lighted magnifying mirror on the wall, but if this is not the way you typically put on makeup..you will not like it. I just took my makeup bag outside on the terrace and used natural light. The views are perfect. You can hear and see the ocean night and day from your room. Heaven. The butler service is right there , whenever you call. One tip - ask for two pots of coffee in the morning, if you enjoy more than a cup and a half per person. And, make sure that you don't let them do the turn down service until you are ready. If you like to walk the beach, or natural trails - we have not experienced any better. There are little to no people on the beach. It is well kept and our morning walks were the favorite part of the day. There were a couple of restrooms along the way. They were decorated like a home bath and very clean! They also have walking trails in the front acreage of the resort. And you can do some canoeing for another activity. We choose to never leave the resort from the time we checked in. (we stayed at a nearby hotel for a four day convention prior and did the trip to Old San Juan, etc) We opted to use a taxi and not the transfer service that the resort offers. It's a savings of at least $100 each way and the taxis are pretty good in P.R. There are only three restaurants at this point. An expansion is underway with more shops and restaurants. If you get creative...you can avoid the same experience every day and the food is great. Another tip....we asked our taxi driver to stop at a local grocery store before arriving. We stocked up on lots of water, other beverages, some breakfast foods, snacks, juice, fruit, etc. It does save you lots of $$$. They have an in room refrigerator with plenty of space for extra supplies. We especially loved the Jean Georges restaurant - Fern. Ask to eat outside on the terrace - we thought the only way to go. Inside is nice...but why not enjoy the tropical feel if you can. Our last night, we requested a certain table and had reservations weeks before. We got there early to check on the table, before having a drink at the bar downstairs. Someone gave the table away! However...the staff was more than apologetic, setting up a new one and giving us each a free appeitizer. We also enjoyed the restaurant at the golf club - Molasses. The staff will give you a ride there, or you can just take the path along the beach. There too, we would recommend the outside seating. All of the staff were excellent...very different from our experience at other resorts on the island. The pool - the best chaise lounges that we have seen at a resort. Great service. Our only complaint....too many kids and no pool dedicated to kids. We wish that they will add a kids pool during the expansion! It was very irritating to hear the squeals and yelling and hear the water splashing all of the time. We would not have guessed this resort to be a place to bring children. Maybe it was the time of year. Kids were always in the hot tub....so we stayed clear of that! The Remede Spa - one of the best spas that we have experienced. We each had a couple of massages and for most part, they were great. The facilities are more than fantastic. If you don't wish to have a treatment, they will charge you a fee of $30 per day to use the facilities. Great steam, sauna, hot tub, cold water plunge, etc. The hair and nail salon is also top quality. My husband golfed, by himself, one day. They had a computerized GPS that guided him throughout every hole. He loved it! And the course was wonderful. Overall....we had near perfect days and it was total relaxation!

We also felt that the options for Dining were much too limited with only room service and fern available for breakfast and molasses and fern for dinner. Going into town is very expensive as a cab is at least $35 each way and the drivers are a bit crazy in puerto Rico. We took a cab from the airport which was $65 one way and much more reasonable than the $168 car service from the airport one way! Tennis facilities were fair with only 2 courts and appear to have had plans for more courts but have not expanded yet. The tennis house looks like a fema trailer but the pro, Carl was very nice and proficient as an instructor. Private tennis lessons run $100 per hour but the hotel offers tennis clinics for $40 per day and I was the only person who signed up on multiple days thus enjoying one on one instruction for the clinic price. The hotel does have a running map and it is pleasant to jog around the property but you really do not have space to run more than 3 miles without repeating your route multiple times. Overall we enjoyed our stay but probably would not come back to puerto Rico. The st Regis always prove to be a lovely property but the bah beach is not one we would repeat.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mystery", "Title": "\u201cI want to like this place, but very frustrating....\u201d", "Author": "MysteryShopper27", "ReviewID": "UR101065799", "Content": "I am 30 hours into a 5 night stay at the St. Regis Bahia Resort, Puerto Rico and far from happy. More like frustration after frustration. The hotel has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that seem systemic and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll provide a list below, but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see taking time to elaborate beyond this as the management just needs to get their act together, plain and simple. - I spent a week emailing and calling the concierges trying to set-up dining reservations prior to arrival. After 7 days I had only one breakfast reservation. How does this happen anywhere? When I emailed and asked that the GM call me he did not. I did get my reservations squared away the next day when I, again, called the hotel, and spoke to the head concierge who was strong and helpful. - Gate staff had trouble locating my name (which is straightforward / not complex) on their check-in registry. - Gate staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assurances that the welcome staff were waiting for us at the valet circle proved wrong. Not only did the staff struggle with my name all over again, but we had a lengthy wait while the valets moved slowly with parties ahead of us rather than taking charge of the available space to pull our car forward and keep things moving. - I realized at check-in that any hustle in the driveway would not have mattered as check-in was backed-up. I had a drink in the bar, while I waited. The staff knew I was waiting for a turn at check-in. Eventually, someone beyond the two staff members at check-in came over and checked me in at the bar. Could have bought me the drink for the wait, but apparently that was outside of their service mindset. - The first of several keys did not work when we went to our room via a golf cart with a bell hop. - By the way, I was not upgraded even though I am a Platinum and apparently had enough status to land the Presidential Suite the day prior at the Sheraton Old Town, St. John, PR. If you are wondering if you are going to be upgraded at this property I can summarize to: I always get phat upgrades with Starwood, case in point the day prior, if\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they are not upgrading me, well, either something extraordinary is going on or there is no way you are getting upgraded here. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never really know. - Stopped by the desk to get the key fixed and moments later the key did not work at the health club. Yes I know to keep the key away from my phone.didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have my phone on me on the way to the health club and I believe the bellman held the key packet on the way to the room the first time. Yes, this could happen at any hotel, but this was 2 of 5 non-working keys at this hotel, as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll explain. - Meals at the property have been a disappointment. Ordered fish from the menu at Molasses only to find-out they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any that night. Ordered lobster instead and was given a knife and fork. Are they serving their first lobster at the St. Regis Puerto Rico? Folks come on now, a knife and fork? So when I asked for a cracker so I could get at the rest of the claw etc. the waiter returned to say there were no more available. He was most unapologetic about it, too. The restaurant was not full I pointed-out\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6his response\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdthey took them for a private function.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd - I would characterize the waiter as bad and unhelpful. When my 3 yo knocked over a water that was headed for my wife lap my wife and blotted-up the spill, removed the placemats, put the wet mess on the floor. You might be surprised to learn the waiter was at the table (taking our order) when this happened and then proceeded to leave the wet napkins and placemats on the floor next to our table. No one bussed these items the entire meal, they were still there when we left. Also, picking-up the check before we left the table just seemed tacky given that service had been slow during the meal. - Breakfast at Fern was also disappointing. The staffing across both restaurants seems tense, too thin (more waiters are needed) and overwhelmed. As other reviewers have commented, the restaurants are a bit pricey, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think terribly out of line for a St. Regis. My issue is simply wanting a decent meal and service. I actually asked the waitress at Fern if the eggs were instant. They had the strangest texture and must have been sitting for sometime before being served as they had a dark yellow exterior and a more normal lighter interior color when I cut into them. Why else would scrambled eggs have a different color on their outside than inside. The waitress said they were real eggs and organic, actually. I believe her, but question the preparation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.of their scrambled eggs?? We are not talking chateaubriand here folks. - After the second lock-out I asked for 5 keys. We carried three to an off property dinner (we canceled our Fern dinner reservation based on our first two on property dining experiences) and found all three of the keys were not working upon return. Again, I did not make the mistake of putting them next to my cell. I spend 60 nights a year in hotels and would have gone straight to the desk if there was any doubt. Instead, my wife, 3 and 5 year old were left waiting outside (there are no house phones to be found) while I trekked the 10 min. roundtrip to the desk. - Given that we have now had 5 non-functioning keys I asked, mind you for the second time, that the GM please call me tomorrow. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what tomorrow holds, but my guess is someone from the desk will call, but not the GM\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6that would be way too straightforward for this property. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to report back. Believe it or not the list above list is not complete\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6probably 2/3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of our issues from the first 30 hours. Here is just one more: - Forgot to go to an ATM before heading for my flight to Puerto Rico. I have my checkbook and the Starwood site states Platinums can cash checks for $300. Well, first the senior person at the property told me that they only cash Travelers Checks, not personal checks. I had to have someone from the Luxury Desk call the hotel to orient them to their own policy. Resolution? Well, kind of a catch 22\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they now say I can cash checks up to $100 per day up to a total of $300 per stay. Basically a policy that makes it harder to stay longer. This is a classic situation where they could step-up and assist, but no, no accommodation for their frequent guest. Plus a little common sense would say that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m trying to clear a check on a Sunday and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t check-out until Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6plenty of time to catch me before I leave if the check proves bad. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure St. Regis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 must take a huge financial hit annually with customers writing bad checks, ha ha ha. I wonder if there was even one bad check across their 21 property chain all of last year. To that I say thank you for all of your accommodation on this matter\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.you have really wowed me by showing-off your ability to stick to your policy; once I pointed-out what the policy actually says. My guess is that they must throw guests in jail that lose their wallets on vacation\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I mean they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take-on that kind of financial burden, right, or is that they just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be helpful? In closing, I would like to think along the lines of other reviewers that this place just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it together because it is still too new, but I have been there and done that with other properties and I feel this resort has a different feel. There is something wrong here, the challenges are too obvious and systemic\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I bet this place changes management, brands or something big before it gets on the right track.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cTrust me - it's amazing!\u201d", "Author": "undertone", "ReviewID": "UR100723227", "Content": "I have traveled a lot for business and pleasure and enjoy staying at luxury hotels; I also love good food and have pretty high standards, particularly when I'm spending a lot of money; however, I am generally not a big fan of beach resorts because I tend to get stir crazy and I don't enjoy feeling exploitative of/resented by unfriendly staff. With the exception of an AWFUL family trip to Beaches years ago on the Turks and Caicos, the last beach vacation I had was at Little Dix more than ten years ago. With all that as preamble, I can recommend the St Regis Bahia Beach without any reservations whatsoever, save price. And on the question of price, I'd say that in order to enjoy a vacation of this sort, you have to enter an alternative reality and not think about what it's costing. Because of course it's ridiculous to pay $6 per glass of delicious, freshly squeezed oj (and when the waitress sweetly asks if you'd like a refill and you say just \"half a glass,\" you can expect to see $12 on the bill...), but if you are able to suspend that little voice in your head, then you will have a fabulous time at the St Regis. I had read all the reviews on TripAdvisor and was prepared for a highly imperfect experience. We had one glitch the entire four days/three nights we spent here (definitely the way to go to optimize the value for money equation): they neglected to deliver our complimentary French press coffees the first morning, but quickly agreed to comp us coffee at breakfast to make up for it. Otherwise, pretty much perfection. Service was friendly, genuine, expert, and enthusiastic - from the bartender who invented a fresh mango rum cocktail when asked for something different, to the beach attendant who happily chatted about his December trip to NYC for ten minutes as he set up the chaise, to the butler who came to the room to make our complimentary mojitios our first night there, to the marine biologist who took us on an informative one hour kayak trip around the lakes. Room was huge with ridiculously luxe bathroom, huge patio, great walk-in closet, and absolutely no a/c problems. The grounds were amazing - loved the 2.75 mile nature trail run, which can easily be extended to make a nice four miler. I was very surprised by how good the food was: we ate dinner twice at Fern on the wonderful screened in porch with cooling sea breezes; the menu is basically Jean George's more casual restaurant Nougatine from NYC with local flourishes - delicious grouper, red snapper, and homemade hot sauce - and better food. The wine list is pretty good, a little overpriced, but with some relative bargains if you know where to look. Breakfast at Fern was superb, and dinner one night outside at the more casual Molasses was lots of fun - get the whole fried red snapper! The pool was great, with every whim and need happily attended to. I enjoyed the ocean, even if the water doesn't have the amazing turquoise purity of the Caribbean, and the beach was kept very clean with wonderful vistas of El Yunque behind the resort.

Now I didn't want to be \"that Guest\" that complains so we didn't say anything about not getting that nice perk. The next day we went to the pool and after an hour my wife went back to the room to get something and noticed that someone went through her bag even though it was buried in a suitcase that was zipped up. $40 was missing! We then had to call the manager and secruity to come to our room to discuss what happened. They seemed concerned but not overly concerned considering how mad we were. They said they would interview the housekeeper and get back to us by the end of the day. Well nobody got back to us and I had to call them in the morning to get an update. They told me that they have to hire some outside help and this person was from an outside agency. They didn't find anything on her but she was no longer going to be used by the hotel anymore. I told them OK but what about our money? They said they would get back to me on that. In the meantime while they decide what should be done even though you would think it would be an easy decision we tried to enjoy the rest of our trip. I knew going there about the prices, with that being said you would expect amazing food. Fern is the biggest ripoff! Be prepared to spend $100 each for average food at best! In fact I ordered mashed potatoes with my steak and I swear it was instant. It was like soup! Seagrapes outside by the pool is also crazy! $20 for a burger that is average and Buffalo wings with barely any meat on them for $18! The staff is nice but have no clue how to handle a situation. For example: we ordered a drink for $18 but it had a huge black hair in the middle of it! We told the waitress and she just took it back and got us a new one. No apology or anything! I mean they could have comped us the drink like any resort would but because the staff is so inexperienced they didn't know how to handle it! Ok back to the theft still no word on so when we finallly checked out and got my bill I noticed they took $100 off the bill. I was fine with that but it would've been nice to hear it from the manager. The manager finally came out and said that he left me a message but I checked my voice mail with no message. Anyway to wrap this up. The grounds are amazing but it's overpriced in every way, Staff is nice but have no idea how to deal with issues.

I was somewhat apprehensive about going after reading some of the postings regarding the service levels. I can only speak for our experience, but let me say that we had excellent service throughout our stay. Although we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay exclusively at 5-star properties, we have stayed at many, including a half a dozen Ritz Carlton and St. Regis properties. I can say without hesitation that the service we received was as good or better than any of the other places we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and that is to say it was great. I previously mentioned the particular week traveled to let everyone know we were there on a very busy week when the hotel was completely sold out. The Service: The butler service was there with coffee in the morning each day at exactly at 8am when we requested it, and was always very responsive to provide a DVD for our daughter to watch or sending a cart to pick us. One of the guys in particular who took us around on different occasions is worth making special mention of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Edwin you were great and helped make our stay a special one. We further requested the cleaning service come do our room at 10am each day, and all but one day it was perfectly clean when we returned from our morning by the pool. The concierge service, unlike many reports to the contrary, picked up the phone every time we called within a few rings and was always prompt in getting back to us whether making arrangements to eat on/off the resort, or planning activities like horseback riding. The kids club was fantastic as well. We generally feel guilty leaving our daughter at a club while on vacation and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it often, but she was clearly bored hanging out with us after day 4 and saw the large group of kids from the club traveling around the resort together during the day. She asked if she could go one morning so we dropped her off. For the following three days we were there, she asked if she could go back because she had so much fun doing crafts, swimming with the other kids, and feeding the turtles! Special thanks to the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director David; both for providing our daughter with a great time and making us feel so comfortable leaving her in your capable hands. Every place can use some improvements, so to mgmt I would suggest two areas to focus on: - Pool: Purchase a heater to pump warm water in, at least for a few hours before the sun comes up, it is teeth chattering cold until about 11am and longer if not a particularly sunny day. Also, seating is an issue. There are not enough seats for the guests so we were forced to play the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wake up and save seats game\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd each day, and for a 5-star resort that is somewhat unacceptable. I would like to acknowledge Freddie and Anthony who do a great job managing the guests fighting over chairs. Suggestion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c get rid of one of the two cabana sections as they are almost never used and you can add at least 20 seats for the guests in just one of those sections. - Food: Although I am from Manhattan and can take high prices, two sandwiches and a kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meal with no alcohol shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cost $100. Shave 10-20% off the prices, at least at the poolside restaurant Seagrapes. Overall I will, and have to friends, highly recommend the resort. Take advantage of all the sprawling resort has to offer. We are certainly not your active type of vacationers, but we took the bikes out for a ride one day, a kayak the next, played some golf, and walked the secluded beach each evening at dusk collecting shells. It is truly a unique resort and wonderful experience.

We also had breakfast here every morning which was delicious with gorgeous views. Molasses, is another restaurant on the property which was good, but we liked our appetizers much better than the mains. dont forget to make reservations using opentable...an easy way to rack in a couple hundred points! a trip to the kioscos (Tapas 13) on Ruta 3 is a must. as far as excursions, we would HIGHLY recommend going on the bio-bay late night tour at 830 with http://www.kayakingpuertorico.com/. and a catamaran day-trip with Castillo for a beach/sailing day and some snorkeling. at the st. regis pool, there were a lot of young kids, but for the most part not really a bother. it was the end of president week vacation so most of them were gone for the back half of our trip and it got noticeably more quiet. if you are an early riser, i would suggest heading to the pool before your morning workout or breakfast to reserve chairs...when we got there at 930 the first day most of the chairs were already reserved, despite the fact that noone was sitting in them. we loved Freddy on the pool staff. he was beyond friendly and helpful with us even planning our next vacation back to PR! all in all, ive traveled a lot... 50+ countries... and this is BY FAR AND AWAY the most ridiculous place i have ever stayed. i can understand that with paying a great deal of money you have certain expectations, but mistakes happen and it is a new property. just relax like you're supposed to and roll with anything. youll be much happier than if you demand perfection and feel that sense of entitlement (you will always be disappointed you with that attitude).", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cDo NOT, under ANY circumstances, go to this resort\u201d", "Author": "BahiaAwful", "ReviewID": "UR100323170", "Content": "I can't begin to describe the utter incompetence of a resort that dares to charge the rates it charges.

She and I were beyond thrilled with our choice of the St. Regis Bahia Beach. The moment we arrived at the hotel until the minute we left our everyy request and needs were met. The ration of staff to guests is around 2 to 1! Our mornings began by our butler bringing our french pressed coffee to our room. We would call the night before requesting what time it should be delivered. The butler arrived promptly each day and placed our coffee on the balcony. The hotel will alsp provide your paper of choice at your door each morning. After our coffee we would head over to Fern, one of the restaurants on the property, for breakfast. Fern was located in the main plantation house. It is recommended that you make a daily breakfast reservation (which can be done on open table if you don't feel like going through the hotel). Make sure to request the veranda for each meal because the ambiance is gorgeous and a very peaceful way to begin your day. The food is excellent for breakfast. My suggestion would be to head to the pool before breakfast and reserve your chairs for the day. The pool chairs did get reserved quickly eventhough many of the guests were not even at their chairs until 11 am. The pool itself is gorgeous. The water is cold but with the hot PR sun, the cool water was more refreshing than not. The staff at the pool is super friendly and very accomodating. You can have lunch at your chair or at Seagrapes which is located adjacent to the pool. The food is great! What is even better is how fast the food is brought to you after you order. We never waited more than 10-15 minutes to eat! The spicy tuna maki was to die for! The other wonderful part about the pool is that throughout the day there are cold snacks brought around, i.e. popsicles, small smoothie samples, small sorbet samples, frozen grapes, and various ice teas. This was a great added treat to cool you off! In addition, the pool has magazines available to peruse and free sunscreen to use throughout the day (only SPF 15 though). I have read other reviews that discuss loud music being played at the pool....we did not hear any loud music. Two of the days a local band played off near the beach and it was not too loud and made for a more authentic feel while you sat poolside. As for the rest of the resort - make sure to take advantage of the free events occuring throughout the day, i.e. a rum tasting, the bikes and water activities at the boat house, the marshmellow roasts during the weekend and the champagne tasting in the plantation house. The bike/walk/run path is very nice and quiet and a great place to escape and get some exercise. We went on a run on the path (which is a little less than 3 miles) and didn't see another person the entire time which was nice. The trail is clearly marked and there are iguanas and birds all around. The workout room on the property, though somewhat smaller, has all the necessary equipment. Each machine is continuously supplied with a fresh towel and fresh bottle of water...there are also fresh apples in the gym available for the taking. As far as dinner is concerned we ate one night at Fern and one night at Molasses. The food at Fern was spectacular, as should be expected from the famous chef and for the $$$. It was also great to sit on the veranda at Fern for dinner because if it is windy the veranda has opaque shades that are pulled down to block the wind and make dining more enjoyable. Dinner at Molasses was very good as well. The inside was very cold from the air conditioning so we requested to sit outside which was much nicer. The inside looks more like a typical restaurant so being outside was preferred, especially because you listen to the crashing of the waves. Molasses is located in a different location on the property so we were given a ride there on a golf cart and then walked back after dinner to walk off dinner. Everything on the property is within walking distance, however, the grounds are expansive so wherever you go there is an option of being driven on a golf cart. Guests aren't allowed to use the carts, only be driven around on them. If you do plan on leaving the resort to explore PR, I would recommend renting a car (as long as you are good at following directions or reading a map). The roads and raod markings in PR are a bit confusing at first but it was much more cost efficient to have a car rather than use transportation from the hotel or local taxis. The only downside to renting a car is the $22.00/day valet fee required. There is not a self park option at the resort. However, the car service is very prompt and they even washed our car off for us and added windshield wiper fluid when we ran out! The hotel also has printed directions to most places you would be traveling to (other hotels, restaurants, common excursions) so make sure to have them print those out for you before you leave. If you do venture outside the gorgeous grounds there are some local kiosks (kioscos) nearby off of Route #3 that have some great and cheaper food. The hotel recommended Tapas 13 and it was fabulous and full of local flare. The wait staff was very friendly and make great food recommendations for us to try. These kiosks are a great alternative dinner option, especially if you are on your way to/from an activity (ie the biobay kayak tour, the catamaran boat tours or El Yunque National Forest). We did head over the Grand Melia one night for dinner for a change of scenery. This was a mistake! The restaurant (it was sushi and habachi) was not very good and the hotel was nothing special and not worth leaving the beautiful St. Regis.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cPriceless details and service at a price.\u201d", "Author": "dupedtourist", "ReviewID": "UR98775282", "Content": "First, the good. This is a beautiful resort with perfectly manicured grounds, an outstanding staff and a very nice pool and beach area with no crowds. The details are very, very well done. This is a big step up from the tacky nearby Melia Cocoa Beach resort or your garden variety Hyatt, Hilton or Westin vacation spot. Think Ritz Carlton plus. It is gated and guarded and there are only 135 rooms, so this place has a very private club feel. My guess is that the staff outnumbers the guests about 2 to 1 and while we were told that the resort was fully booked, it only felt about 1/3 full. Very relaxing. Rooms are clustered in condo-like pods and are finished like a $500,000 to $1,000,000 home (depending on where you live!) with dark wood, marble and huge bathrooms. Now the bad. The location is pretty remote and unless you are pretty adventurous, there are no real dining and entertainment options nearby. And by the way, the rooms start at $1000 a night. That's not a typo for one hundred. That's one large and they climb north all the way to $1800 for rooms that are not even suites. A quick web search found no discounts, so if you want to live the life here, you'll have to pony up. Example: a small bag of cashews from the room mini bar costs $18. That's nuts. Luckily, I don't like cashews and I didn't pay these rates, I used Starwood points -21,000 pts. a day mind you- but my stay only cost the $60 a day \"resort fee\" (whatever that is) that they charge SPG members cashing in points. Pretty petty, if you ask me, considering I earned these points spending $30k a year staying at their mediocre Westins, Sheratons and Le Merdiens for business. Is it worth the dollars or points? Read on. No matter what issues I may have had on this trip, none of it was due to the lovely Puerto Ricans. They are friendly, polite and helpful. And they all have nice teeth. One thing you'll notice driving around that there is a dentist on every block, along with a muffler shop and a Burger King. Back to the St. Regis. Be aware that you will be an hour from San Juan and the traffic can be slow, so you'll have to plan day trips back to the city or points west carefully. A cab costs a $120 from the airport, so you may want to do the math and rent a car like we did for $35 a day. Be sure to factor in $28 a day for valet parking at the hotel plus tips. Having car is nice, as you'll be close to the east coast towns like Fajardo (supposed to be nice but we didn't find much there but a ferry to Vieques) Luquillo Beach (super nice, calm, public beach) and El Yunque, the rainforest (well worth visiting). Oddity #1: Finding this resort, even with a map is a challenge. The turn off from Rt.3 to Rt. 187 is in a busy construction zone and then you have to pass through the small town of Rio Grande, which is anything but grand, but there is a dentist. As hard as you may look, you'll find no St. Regis branded directional signs, nada. Look for a tiny white Bahia Beach sign, then you'll drive through 3-4 miles of rural fields before the gates sneak up on you. If it were dark, we would may not have found it and may have ended up sleeping in a Burger King lot. A call to the hotel front desk took 3 hand-offs before we got (vague) directions. Once inside the property, it's a different world from anything leading up to it. It's a wonderland of exotic grounds keeping, expansive nature reserves, manicured golf courses, fountains, walkways and paths. Muy spectacularama (my Spanish isn't very good). The center of the resort is a plantation-styled building with columns and porches and a torch-lined drive up, complete with a Koi pond (I henceforth avoided the sushi), a Bentley limo and a swarm of valets making up a scene worthy of a Life Styles of The Rich and Famous re-run. Check in with your own personal agent at a mahogany desk, leather chairs and a glass of champagne, is pretentious. A nice touch I suppose, but it took forever to sit through the whole spiel. It felt a lot like signing a mortgage loan. Sadly, you could buy a house in, say, Detroit, for what it cost to stay here. As is normal for about 50% of my SPG stays, my Platinum level status got me nothing in the way of room upgrades. I was told, in St. Regis parlance, that the hotel was \"fully committed.\" I was ready to be committed after getting stiffed again. However, our room was very nice, by any standards, and was well finished with top quality materials but was nowhere near the pool or beach. This turned out to be OK, as it was in a very private, quiet corner facing a forest and the golf course. Be aware that you may have to whine, or pay, to be closer to the facilities. To be fair, the front desk offered to switch our room when one opened up but we decided that we liked our location, so we stayed put. The beds are plush and the bathrooms are huge. Our shower alone was likely bigger than the chambermaid's house. The resort only opened last November, so it still has that new look and feel. No dirty grout, peeling wallpaper, etc., that older \"classic\" (code for need renovation badly) high-end joints suffer from. Oddity #2: I learned from the front desk after complaining about a warm room that the hotel regulates the air conditioning through a motion sensor. No motion in the room (like when you're sleeping) means a warmer room. What this means is that you can set your thermostat to 65 degrees and it might ratchet up to 75, which is hot in a humid climate. Opening your porch or patio doors (ours had no screens) shuts it off completely. A call to the front desk netted a response 24 hours later telling us that they would re-set our thermostat to the VIP setting, giving us access to unbridled a/c settings. I guess only VIPs deserve to be really comfortable. Wait a minute, Platinum members are supposed to VIPs....never mind. This is one of those new \"green\" (green as in it makes more money for the hotel) initiatives that hotels are trying to pull over on us. Hey, SPG, these are rich people- Republicans. They want cold a/c, their dirty linen changed, hot water, a new bar of soap and lights that work without an instruction manual. Replace your 5 mpg Bentley limo with a Prius if you want to go all tree hugger on us, just leave us out of it. Speaking of rich people stuff, St. Regis likes to brag about the personal butler that comes with your room. I read all about it on their web site, and my personal mortgage banker, I mean, check- in assistant, went on and on about their man Jeeves. We never saw this phantom and the best we could tell is that it's basically just room service. Order some ice- and someone brings it. Big deal. There are 3 restaurants on the property and they were all good, if not expensive. Expect to pay $150 for 2, with decent wine, except for the pool restaurant/bar called Sea Grapes, which is more like $50 for lunch for 2 and inexplicably closes at 5 pm. The other 2, Fern, upstairs in the main building, and Molasses at the golf club, featured the expected meat and seafood with some local spin. The servers, like all of the native staff members, were gracious. Oddity #3: Be wary of the restaurant reservation system. Twice we told that there were no openings near our requested times, and twice we showed up at those times and the places were half or near empty. Local options are sparse and night driving is hairy, especially after drinking, so get a cab and good recommendations if you want to skip the jacked up hotel fare. The beach and pool areas are spiffy, but oddly, hardly anyone was swimming in either during our stay. The ocean was clean but the water was a little off color and the sand has a dark, gravel color that made it less appealing than the bright white sand you may be used to in Mexico or other Caribbean spots. But there are 2 miles of deserted shore to walk, so overall the beach rates an A-minus. It was hard to fault the pool(s) and deck area with the multiple pools, lots of plush lounge chairs, nice towels and umbrellas and many locations for sun, shade, ocean view, etc. Kudos on the music mix too. No obnoxious rap or Caribbean party music or camp counselor-types trying to drum up conga lines or games of Marco Polo. While the cost and the lack of activities prevent this from being a real family place, there were a good number of families here. You might feel out of place bringing screaming kids that run around cannonballing into the pools, so bring a nanny or keep them in line or you might get dirty looks from someone like me. There are several golf courses within the friendly confines but in 4 days we only saw 3 players. Maybe the $250 greens fees or the numerous sunning iguanas scared off the duffers. The tracks appeared to be first rate, with many holes along the ocean and lots of cute girls driving beverage carts. The Jurassic Park-like nature grounds of the resort are worth touring on foot, or by bike, which are available at the boathouse that you pass on the way in. These bikes are the only things at the entire resort that are free, so play Lance Armstrong for as long as you can. The gears didn't work either of ours, so our Tour De France fantasy was short-lived. So the million dollar mini bar bill, I mean, the million dollar question, is: Was it worth it? Yes, if you're using points. We were impressed by nearly every aspect of this resort and had a great time. But the answer is no, if you're paying with real dinero. Our 4 night stay (2 of us), with 3 restaurant dinners w/wine, 2 lunches and maybe 6 drinks would have cost $4900. That's some serious jack that could buy you a whole house for 12 w/maids and cooks in Mexico, Jamaica, etc.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cSurpassed Our Expectations\u201d", "Author": "melinnyc", "ReviewID": "UR98711149", "Content": "We nearly canceled our trip to the St. Regis Bahia Beach due to all the negative Trip Advisor reviews, but the reviews improved as we got closer to our stay, so we chanced it. And we LOVED it. The resort was absolutely beautiful and felt very special and private (except for the pool, which got busy, of course), the staff was warm and attentive and having left our 2 year-old at home, we were able to completely and utterly relax. Coffee every morning on our balcony overlooking the water, brought to us by our butler, was one of the highlights of each day. The pool was gorgeous, and the beach, while not the most beautiful beach ever, was still lovely, perfect for a walk and a swim. The food was the one major downside of the hotel. All the restaurants were pretty overpriced (though we expected this, given the caliber of the resort.) But if we're paying those prices, we want to love the food. Our one dinner at Fern (the Jean-George restaurant) was very inconsistent -- my husband absolutely loved his meal (highly recommend the grouper, with a side of the ginger rice!), whereas my salmon dish was very fishy and unappealing. Breakfast was delicious, but at $60 (for 2), that was more than dinner at some of the local restaurants we found. Food at the pool was passable, but nothing special. So we changed course... we bought some breakfast foods at Ralph's (local grocery store) to put in our fridge, and went off-property for dinners. We discovered the very local \"kioscos\" -- very stripped down restaurants about 15 minutes from hotel in Luquillo and had some great meals there. It was nice to not feel trapped at the hotel (as beautiful as it was), so if you go that route, you need your own rental car, which means you're at the mercy of the $22/day valet charge. Do note that the resort is very removed from everything. It's 15 minutes to Luquillo (which isn't much of a town, to be honest, but there are some good cheap eats), and as much as 40 minutes to Old San Juan (we went one night for dinner -- WAY too far to drive just for dinner when you're talking roundtrip!). That was a bit of a pain, but we thought the resort was so beautiful and special, that it was worth going off-property for meals to experience some local culture and keep the budget in check.

The location is perfect and the hotel is very secluded. This St. Regis reminds me of the Four Seasons in Kona on the big island with it's tropical format, expansive golf course and spectacular pools and private beach. Our room was a garden view on the second floor just behind the pool and it felt like you were the only group staying even though the hotel was fully booked the week we stayed. Beds were extremely confortable, the balcony was fantastic and we ate on our terrace many mornings enjoying the room service bakery basket and complimentary French press coffee from our Butler. All the restaurants were great. They had a fantastic Oscar night party where there were actually really full size Oscar statues, a red carpet and even the napkins were shaped and folded in the form of Tuxedo's at the Sea Grapes restaurant. We initially were only going to put our children in the activities camp called teh Iguana for two days but they liked it so much, they ended up staying in the Iguana Club for four Afternoons. Everyone was friendly and asked what they could do to help out. The general manager seemed to be all over the grounds at all times making sure everything was running smoothly which it did. Pablo at the door was extremely friendly and helpful as well as Denise the conciege who recommended a great restaurant to eat at in Old San Juan where the staff dresses in ancient costumes called Raices. Also loved the Remede Spa, one of the best spa's and massage that I've ever had. You get free chocolate samples and champagne. Also liked the special events such as the free Rum tasting. The restaurant FERN defenitely meets the expectations of a Jean George eatery both in service and food quality. Truely super delux. There is very little to criticize here except for the fact that a handout given when we arrived mentioned buffet breakfeasts on the weekends but the hotel only had the buffet for just one weekend for winter break. Also food and drink is on the expensive side especially with tip included with alternating tip percentages at different locations but this isn't really a big complaint because I've never stayed at a hotel where food and drink is a bargain anyway. The way to get around this is to rent a car and be willing to drive to San Juan where there are amazing restuarants at lower prices.

We thought it was excellent and we met a lot of nice families and couples at the resort and everyone seemed very happy. There were plenty of activities for all.

They were booked solid and there werent any issues with service or level of professionalism. If you want to fixate on very minor things you might be able to find some little things like the coffee was 5 minutes late or whatever. Our overall impression was one of promt service and extremely luxurious surroundings from the room decor to the plantation house, to the lounge chairs at the pool. Everything is high end marble, granite, stainless steel, comfortably appointed and highly fashionable. Things not to miss: dinner at Fern. It was as good as any high end restaurant anywhere in the world with a large selection of exotic and detailed dishes and wines. We ate there twice. Golf, if you play do not miss this course. It is an absolutlely beautiful experience. Several holes are on the ocean or view the ocean and the ones that don't have their own special appeal. Golf carts with GPS computer screen showing distance to pin from cart, and tips on playing the hole. Great round and not at all crowded. Great full service club house, pro shop and high end locker room. Tennis: great pro on staff, beautiful surroundings and many raquets to choose from for use (free). Boating: free use of small sail boats, kayaks, paddle boats, mountain bikes for the trails and exploring the 400 acre property. Plantation House Bar: great place for early evening coktails, inside/outside walk around this area and mingle with other guests. We found friendly and interesting people. The pool is beautiful, plenty of chairs and umbrellas. Food at Seagrapes is right off the pool with full service outdoor covered bar with flatscreens and gorgeous stone bar. Waiter service right to your lounge chair spot is convenient. Special thanks to Paula, the pool/beach manager made sure we (and everyone) had everything we needed. Also David, the Property Manager was a personable and professional representative for the Organization. Too many staff members to remember and thank...were all educated, well-spoken, helpful and friendly. Top-shelf experience with all the staff. A tip, rent a car at the airport. It is great to get around for little excursions and a relative bargain compared to cabs and waiting around. You're going to spend money on food and beverages at the resort. Nothing new for a high end resort, $18 burger, $15 mixed drink, dinner entrees in the $30-40 range etc...but you can offset some of this expense with a trip to Ralph's to buy a few things for the room. Cereal, milk, snacks, fruit for the kids. Adult beverages for the parents is nice to have around for cocktail hour and a nightcap on the deck. There is a nice sized fridge in the room.

We generally go to the Caribbean or Hawaii once a year and all agreed this is the nicest resort we have ever visited. We wanted to catch an early flight in an attempt to outrun a snow storm and called the hotel to see if we could check in early. Miraculously one of our two rooms was available, making our check-in at 3am possible. Our children's room wasn't ready so the hotel provided us with two air mattresses. As others have noted, the rooms are enormous and the two air mattresses easily fit into the room. The bathrooms were also incredibly spacious. Because we had two connecting rooms (before noon our first day) we were able to compare the rooms - the room with the two queen beds had a nicer bar area and also had a separate toilet room, whereas our toilet (in the king room) was out in the open. Other than that they were interchangeable. The grounds are more beautiful than the photos on the website. The beach and pools areas were incredibly clean and chairs were always available even with the hotel booked to capacity. I also loved how the architect created small buildings that were tucked into the jungle - wherever we looked it was lush and green; you almost didn't see the buildings until you were on top of them. My kids loved the paddle boats and also explore the bird sanctuary. Having read previous reviews, I wasn't expecting great service and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the service and the lengths the staff would go to accommodate guest wishes. On the way to the bird sanctuary my children stopped a staff member to ask directions; he promptly stopped whatever it was he had been doing and not only escorted them to the sanctuary, but gave them a private tour. The kids loved it. As has been noted, the food at the resort is incredibly expensive. The first day, not including alcohol, we spent $600 on food (two adults and a teenage boy and girl). CRAZY. We visited Ralph's Supermarket and bought breakfast supplies, snacks, alcohol and fruit juices and had breakfast and cocktails in the room. We asked that the refrigerator be emptied to make room for our supplies and the butler was happy to do so. We took advantage of the complementary butler coffee service each morning, and arranged a delivery time upon check in. We had dinner in Molasses and Fern, and enjoyed both meals. We tried Seagrapes and Molasses for lunch, and would also recommend both. If you're interested in dining off property, visit the kiosks in Luquillo! We loved El Jefe Burger (not your typical burgers, mine was layered with braised short ribs, and my son had his layered with chiles and peppers). Try the El Jefe fries and the El Jefe cheese sauce. Also the special mojitos with ginger. We also dined at Pasta Y Pueblo, which is a tiny shack of a restaurant in Luiquillo. Great skirt steak and fish served with coconut rice. We noticed many families with small children and very few teenagers...maybe because the hotel is very quiet and doesn't have activities for older kids? In any case, my children still loved it even though they had to entertain themselves.

We made reservations less than a week in advance at St. Regis through Amex. We arrived at the resort and its really breathtaking \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the landscape with all the palm trees and the private beach. Our room was beautiful and the bathroom was particularly amazing with a huge shower and tub. And I have to say that this hotel has the best complimentary toiletries. I rarely use hotel's shampoo, soap, etc but they had some really nice stuff here that I gave them a try. When you go to the pool area, a staff person checks you in and will escort you to either poolside or the beach, which is nice because you don't have to wander around to look for empty chairs. The resort has 3 restaurants, we only ate at 2 of them, Jean Georges' Fern and Seagrapes. The food at both restaurants were excellent and the staff were equally great! Our waiter at Fern was very helpful and friendly and gave us some great recommendations on the menu. The staff at Seagrapes and at poolside (Seagrapes is essentially the poolside) were great! Our waitress who served us on poolside was very friendly and remembered us when we returned the next day. On our last afternoon there, we had lunch at Seagrapes. I wasn't too hungry but figured we should eat something before the long flight. I ordered the fish sandwich but skipped the bread and just ate the fish. The waiter came by and asked if something was wrong with the bread and offered another dish. That was really attentive and nice of him! Its a beautiful resort but their management needs serious improvement. When we booked the room, we were told that we would have to pre-pay, which was fine. But that didn't happen, we ended up paying everything when we checked out. This is completely fine but this is just the start of the confusion with the staff. They never seem to pick-up the phone for room service, operator, etc. The room service line were frequently busy but after several tries, the phone would ring and ring and ring... when someone eventually picked up, they were very nice and helpful but it made me wonder if they really had only one line going for room service for the entire resort. Also, on our first morning there, we slept in until late afternoon. Housekeeping came by around 11 am and we told her that we were getting ready to head out so asked her to come back in about 30 minutes. No one came back so we didn't get any housekeeping service that day -- had to call for extra towels since we used up all ones in the room. When we checked in, we received a letter from the general manager welcoming us to the hotel and gave us a list of offers for our stay - one of which included 15% off spa treatments. My husband and I got massages on our first morning there. Unfortunately, when we were checking out, the receptionist had no idea about the 15% discount. Fortunately, I saved the letter but had packed it away in my suitcase. I had to open and undo my suitcase to find the letter to show the receptionist. Only then she said she would honor it because I had the letter. I found this appalling! Why would I randomly make up a 15% discount?!?! In the end it was only $40 off our total bill, but its really obnoxious for the management to give us this offer but not to make some sort of record of it. So overall, it was a beautiful resort but the staff need a better way to communicate with each other.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cA work in progress\u201d", "Author": "FamilyTraveler4ofus", "ReviewID": "UR97987490", "Content": "We had a one week stay that was fantastic, but not without issue. The hotel is totally gorgeous and our room was spacious, modern and well laid out. Our balcony and bathroom and walk in closet were the largest I've ever had at a hotel. And the poolside food is outstanding in service and the cuisine is delicious. The pool set up is amazing. there are about 6 or 7 little pools that connect to each other and are awesome and relatively warm. The worst part about the pools is that for kids under 5, the kiddie section is located in front of reserved cabanas which during our week, no one ever even occupied. So parents can't sit comfortably while their kids are in the water. But really the main issues are with location and service. This hotel is in a very remote location - a $65 taxi to the airport and just about as much to San Juan. So if you are looking to go out at night to different restaurants, either rent a car or stay at the Ritz. And bring everything you need because the gift shop has nothing of use it in. There is a total lack of communication among the staff and no one ever knows the right answer. One tells you the tennis racquets are at the courts, then you get there and find out they are at the front desk. One tells you they made a reservation for you at Fern, and when you show up there is no reservation. The concierge recommended a restaurant 15 minutes away and the food was good. It was 25 minutes and a $40 taxi and the menu had pictures of the food on it. I would never have expected a St Regis employee to recommend such a dump. This drove us and other people we spoke to absolutely nuts. Finally, while we were there they had COMPLEMENTARY drop-off-your-kids movie night for 3 nights in a row. We were overjoyed! But sadly, many people didn't even know about it as I later learned and would have appreciated a notice under the door or a posting near the pool. Go to relax and get away.

An easy, domestic, non-stop flight lands you in San Juan and the St Regis is only a 20-25m drive away (I say this from experience!) The hotel car service is expensive ($168 each way + tip) so if you have more time, or perhaps rental car elite/convenience status, a rental car is not a bad idea. I think parking is included in the $60/day resort fee. The hotel is situated directly in the middle of 2 miles of pristine beach which is outstanding for beach walks. For a moment, you can get away from the other guests and feel like you're on your own island. There is one pool and a designated 'beach club' area. The hotel only has 139 rooms so there aren't too many people around (yet... Residences are under construction). The pool bar and service are great. The pathway music was loud at times for guests lounging on their patios but you can't hear it once you go inside. We never figured out what they're trying to cover up with the ambience music. There are 3 restaurants and we sampled each of them. Fern was outstanding (killer Octopus) and Seagrapes offered very good beach/pool fare (ask for the Mahi Mahi sandwich as a wrap instead). Molasses had a limited menu but you should order the Mofongo - so you don't need any other options! There are people who have complained about the F&B pricing throughout the hotel but you have to remember that you're at a St Regis. The prices are high, but the quality is superb and the portion sizes are very generous. The spa was the only sore spot of our trip and I can see where earlier 'a lot of potential but...' reviews may have originated. Once the same attention that has been applied elsewhere reaches the spa, I'm sure that I will change my mind. In short, there were some lapses in service and my masseuse did not provide the 'deep tissue' massage I requested so it was a bit of a waste of $200 (60m massage). In summary, the hotel is too easy to get to for us not to return! If you're looking for luxury that's quick and easy to reach (all you need is a driver's license) - you would be a fool to go elsewhere. We thought about the Ritz-Carlton for a moment and I'm glad that we didn't select them. The Ritz-Carlton is directly adjacent to the airport and surrounded by a Courtyard and a Chili's.

We were cautious about booking a trip here after reading some of the earlier reviews. Bottom line- do not hesitate. It was amazing! The resort is absolutely gorgeous and so relaxing. The pool, beach, and spa are magnificent as are the meticulously groomed grounds. Book a spa service and spend some extra time at the spa before or after- it is well worth it! We used the free bikes, kayaks, and paddleboards which were a blast as well- the only downside to the paddleboards and kayaks are that you are limited to a cove that smells and is on the small side so that you go around in circles. But it was still a fun late day activity as was walking the gorgeous beach. The room was gorgeous, and I had the best night sleep I have ever had at a hotel. The halls were silent and we did not hear a thing! The only complaint that we agreed with from earlier reviews was the food situation. We ordered lunch from Seagrapes on the beach every day and it was wonderful- no complaints at all. Dinner is another story. We ate at Fern twice- the first time we had incredible service (this is a shout out to Miguel- he deserves a promotion!) and a wonderful meal. The next time we went to Fern they ran out of lobsters, the food was salty and dry, and the service was fair. Same with Molasses-salty, dry food and fair service. But the setting was so gorgeous we did not even care. The other thing that hampers your dinner options- the St Regis does not allow cabs. Thus, to go off property you have to either rent a car or take a car service-both of which get expensive. We went to old san juan for a day and night to eat and gamble and to la parilla in loquillo- otherwise we stayed at the resort. It was hard to leave paradise so we really did not mind.

We loved every minute at the property. First - it is a beautiful property. The landscaping (everything from the walkways to the plants and trees) was amazing. They somehow hide the true size of the property through the use of trees, etc to make you feel as if where you are is the only part of the property that exists. It's a little hard to describe, but you'll understand when you see it and you walk around the property and realize how big it really is. Second - we found all of the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. Based on previous reviews we didn't use the concierge service so I can't comment on some of the other guests negative experience there. I can tell you that whenever I needed anything on the property, there were plenty of people willing to help me figure it out. I also had very positive experiences with the butler service. Getting coffee from them in the morning can be a small issue as they are not as timely as you might like, but overall they were very helpful. Pros 1) Walking trails around the property are beautiful. Grab a trail map from the concierge and it will take you through a tour of the extended property. The trails are well marked, mostly paved and have lots of signs describing the local trees, bushes, etc. The trail goes through a nature preserve and bird sanctuary. We walked each morning varying our route between the trails and the beach (you can walk 20 minutes in one direction on the beach and see almost no one). The nature trail is probably 3 miles long if you start at the plantation house. 2) Food is excellent. We ate at Seagrapes for lunch each day and Fern for dinner. While the meals at Fern ran about $125-200/night for the two of us + wine, it was very high quality food and we didn't run out of things we wanted to try on the menu. For those of you that use Open Tables.com for reservations, Fern is a member and you can get points. Also, if you do it that way, you can bypass the concierge which others have noted is a problem. We had no issues with our reservations and were able to do it weeks in advance and get the times we wanted. 3) Beach and pool areas have plenty of chairs with shade or sun. My wife and I were able to work it where she had sun and I had shade for the majority of our stay. 4) Staff are very warm and nice. Their friendliness didn't seem forced. We especially enjoyed the waitstaff (restaurants and plantation bar). They are very nice people and we enjoyed talking with them. 5) Rooms are large and the patio is great (we had a superior king with garden view). There is a large couch on the patio to read and relax and there is a table with two chairs to eat or have your coffee. We spent most of our time in the room on the patio. The bathroom was nice with dual shower heads (rain shower + normal shower). There is also a large soaking tub. Cons 1) you can get isolated out here. You'll need a rental car to get off property to visit El Yunque or eat somewhere else. 2) Air conditioner in rooms are loud. I found the constant blowing to be white noise that didn't affect me (it doesn't turn on/shut off but blows constantly), but the blower is located just over the bed and I can could see where light sleepers or those sensitive to fans/noise could be annoyed. My wife was bugged a little by it but not enough to detract from her sleeping well. 3) bugs. I am one of those that mosquitos seem to like and when I sat outside at dusk, I was bitten several times. Over 5 nights, I probably had 25-30 bites. Fern does keep bug spray available if you sit outside which helps or bring your own. Also, if you avoid dusk, you miss most of the problem. 4) I am a platinum starwood member. I did not get an upgrade at this hotel. The hotel was full, so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised, but if you book a garden view and think you'll get upgraded at check-in, I wasn't. 5) pool/beach beverage service. It's not like I was on spring break looking to do shots before noon, but there isn't any beverage service (water/soda/alcohol) at the pool until Sea Grapes opens at 11am. I thought this was a bit odd. 6) The pool is situated a little strangely for the following reason. The cabanas ($300/day) are located by the only area of the pool with a zero depth entry (re: this is where all the babies and small children play). I can't imagine being a couple buying one of these cabanas only to be situated right next to the kids play area. Conversely, if you have young children with you (we did not), the pool seats right next to the zero depth entry area are reserved for the cabanas therefore you would have to sit elsewhere and walk over to that area to play with your children. If you are looking for quiet, avoid this end of the pool. As noted in other reviews, the pool is situated in a way that you really can't tell how big it is from any one view and if you sit closer to the beach, you won't be near the kids play area.

The St. Regis Bahia Beach property is heads and shoulders above every other resort on the island (note: I've never been to W Vieques). The property itself is stunning. It feels like an eco-resort--it has been built into the environment. The boardwalks over the lush plants are lovely. Gorgeous, spacious rooms (but with loud air conditioners). Lovely pools--though no lap pool for those who want to swim for exercise. The beach is incredible. Property-wise, it is 5-stars and a true St. Regis. BUT... The first rule for a 5-star hotel should always be: Only promise what you truly can deliver. The service is so spotty and erratic. At times, it is St. Regis. At other times, you might as well be at an airport Sheraton. They offer free coffee in your room delivered via butler service. The first 2 mornings, it took almost an hour to arrive. The 2nd morning it was cold. The 3rd and final morning, we placed our order the night before to be safe. When it was 15 minutes late I called--they had no record of the order and said it would be 30 minutes minimum. Not acceptable. When we went to the Plantation House to get free coffee instead--both mornings we did, the coffee pot was empty. It took 3 staff members and 20 minutes to actually get a hot cup of coffee on our final morning in the lobby. Outrageous and embarrassing for a St. Regis. They also proudly offer a complimentary Mojito made fresh in your room by a butler. That's great, but they don't warn you that the butler won't come for 1.5 to 2 hours. By that time we were more than ready to have left our room and would happily have paid for a mojito at the bar. Their centerpiece Jean Georges restaurant is FERN. We went the first night. I would never return. The service was APPALLING. Our waiter made a suggestion which we both took for our entree. 10 minutes later he returned and apologized--the chefs were out of that selection. He proudly recommended that we order a different type of fish but with the same preparation as the original--we did. Another 10 minutes later, he returned to say that the chef was out of \"beans.\" We ordered again. At this point, I still had not received my cocktail that was ordered 30 minutes prior--this only came after I asked 3 separate other workers for it. Also, the caviar appetizer he recommended was so tiny it was more like an amuse-bouche. When the entrees finally arrived--he brought me the wrong dish. After we had had a whole discussion about the temperature and preparation of my dish--he brought something totally different. I sat while my friend ate and waited. No one EVER apologized. No comped desserts. No checking in from a manager. AND the meal was $200. AND the $28 tiny caviar appetizer I ordered was only $18 the following day. BIZARRE. I nicely shared my story 2 days later with Lisa at the front desk, who took 50% off the bill from dinner. The food and drinks are so overpriced at this St. Regis it is shocking. $10 for an iced tea. $18 for a hot dog. They need to get with it. I expect overpriced at a St. Regis but this is too much--AND when the service doesn't match the 5-star prices, it is BAD. The Remede Spa was lovely and well-run. Though I was the only customer there. Overall it was a decent stay--but only because I stayed on Starwood points. If I had been paying the $800/night quoted rate, I would have been really upset. Give this property another 6-12 months before you pay insane prices for it. If you get a good special or use points, go for it. Otherwise, take the longer flight and hit the St. Regis Punta Mita--which is on another whole level and is sheer perfection.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201c5 star luxury but service must improve\u201d", "Author": "ogol17", "ReviewID": "UR97200207", "Content": "My wife and I have just returned from 5 days at the st. Regis Bahia Beach. Like other reviewers, we seriously considered canceling due to the issues mentioned in past reviews, but we are so happy we didn't! At the end of the day and despite service issues that still exist, this is a superb resort that we wish we could return to often. However, while being\u00c2\u00a0a 5-star resort service issues are still too frequent, and especially the ridiculous, incompetent concierge service, which deserves 1 star at most for both attitude and effectiveness. I must note that the hotel management is aware of the service issues, and seems to be working to fix them while seriously listening to guests' complaints and compensating unhappy customers. On the good side: - Everything around the hotel is beautiful and luxurious - from the excellent room amenities (in a very large room), through amazing landscaping, buildings that blend with the natural environment, and excellent nature trails within the resort area. - the pool and the beach are both wonderful. Due to the many pool levels and bays, the pool area feels quiet and peaceful even when many people are around (which doesn't happen too often - during the week the resort felt rather empty, and only the weekend became somewhat busier). While pool water is not heated, we found it definitely warm enough to swim in. The beach is beautiful with the coconut palms set against the ocean, and the sand is clean, soft and nicely groomed every morning. If you walk along the long beach you quickly reach\u00c2\u00a0secluded areas where you feel alone with the tropical forest and the ocean being your only company - just fantastic ! - Other than at the concierge, all employees are genuinely nice and seem to honestly care about you having a good time. This applies to employees all around the resort, and especially to restaurants staff and to the pool staff, who keep checking throughout the day on whether you need anything and pamper you with free treats such as smoothies, frozen fruit, cold tea etc. - All three restaurants are excellent. The Fern provides the most upscale and expensive food ($15-25 for most starters and $30-40 for entrees), while the poolside Seagrapes provides a tasty selection of pizzas, sandwiches and other light meals for prices that are mostly in the $10-25 range, plus a wide selection of drinks (but they are open mostly for lunch, catering for dinners only on weekends). Our favorite by far, however, is Molasses (at the golf club house) with excellent upscale Puerto Rican food, very large portions, superb service and more sensible prices than at Fern's ($10-20 for starters and $25-35 for most entrees). Having enjoyed our time as much as we did, we really wanted to rate this hotel with 5 stars, but service is still far from a 5 star level and we kept running into service issues throughout our stay. Some of the issues were smaller though still inappropriate for a 5 star property - for example the newspaper not being delivered to the room every morning, or the turndown service not showing up as requested. The biggest problem however is with the concierge, who are hard to reach by phone, unpleasant to talk to (with fake smiles instead of genuine wish to help), lack basic knowledge about hotel services, and are completely incompetent in fulfilling your most basic requests (such as confirming a table for the hotel restaurant next door).\u00c2\u00a0To avoid frustration and until the concierge staff learn their job, we strongly suggest that you avoid asking them to arrange anything (from booking a table at the hotel restaurants to calling a taxi), \u00c2\u00a0and instead get the phone numbers from them (hopefully they can at least get them right) and then make the phone calls yourself. As mentioned earlier, hotel management is very responsive to complaints and seems to be working to improve all aspects of service, so I am confident that those issues will be resolved shortly. Prices of both accommodation and dining will probably remain very high, but if you can afford them, this beautiful, peaceful, luxurious property is by far the best place to stay in Puerto Rico.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ct", "Title": "\u201cfantastic resort, beautiful grounds friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "lweiss9069", "ReviewID": "UR97195808", "Content": "My husband and I and another couple stayed there for five nights.

It was difficut to get a hold of them - I e-mailed prior to my leaving many times to get trips and restaurant reservations set up and had problems getting confirmations back which continued even when I was at the hotel. The only other draw back to staying here was that there were no restaurants worth eating at outside of the hotel. The trip to Old San Juan is 45 minutes which makes it a long trip just for dinner. This should be rectified shortly when an extension to the highway is completed which will shorten the trip to San Juan to 20 min. I highly recommend the hotel and would certainly return.

As many state, as a new resort, it is going through some growing pains. This is not a place for the budget conscious. If you're squeamish about money, this is not the place for you. However, if you want a gorgeous location, with great staff this is the place for you. There's no doubt the working staff are absolutely friendly, helpful and accommodating to your every need. They are still working through some process issues with management. The grounds and rooms are simply magnificent. The beach is spectacular with a great view of a small bay and a long wide beach perfect for walking. During our visit it was never crowded and there was always multiple staff on hand for ordering drinks, food or a towel. In fact overall, I marveled at the sheer manpower throughout the visit. There's no shortage of assistance during any part of our visit. We opted for a superior room. I loved the overhead shower and classic huge soaking tub. The daily french press cafe is spectacular and great part of the service provided by their butler service. Overall, when ever we called the Butler service they were extremely helpful and usually very prompt. We only had one occasion where we had to check on the status of an ordered item. The food was very good but nothing was amazing with exception of some chicken soup that we had specially made to order. Breakfast was disappointing and something that could be improved at this level. As stated before, the grounds are great and if you're an active couple there's plenty to do in a no stress environment. . We took advantage of the golf course, the bikes and the sailing. Take advantage of the resort fee and hit some 'free\" balls on driving range (they will supply clubs), ride some bikes, play some tennis (they supply rackets) or take a kayak or sailing lesson. If you want to lounge a the pool or beach all day, this is a great place for that too. We visited during a time when we didn't see many children except for a few pre-school agers. Unless they come up with an adult pool only area, I can see how it would be annoying during holiday breaks. Generally the crowd during our stay was almost all couples or older families. There's little to nothing going on in the evening unless you want to rent an in room movie or sit quietly out on the deck. We opted for both of those but there is no nightlife here. This place could use a pool room. Rent a car if you want to make a trip to the rain forest, nearby restaurants or other attractions. It's a short ride to San Juan, but there's plenty of traffic to deal with during rush hour.

Like many other tripadvisor readers, we were quite aware of the service issues the St. Regis had in the first couple of months they were open. It seems, however, that the management has rectified these issues and this is truly a 5 star resort. What baffles me is a few recent \"bad\" reviews on tripadvisor. They couldn't have stayed at the same resort as we did. The rooms are very large (the smallest is 750 sq. feet!) and beautifully appointed. The bathroom is larger than most bedrooms and is first rate. I know that many people have complained about the room air conditioners being a bit loud, but I certainly did mind it at all. First, you should definitely rent a car since you will not have to depend on taxis to take you to the resort or anyplace off the resort. We used Hertz and it was extremely convenient. The resort itself is so beautiful that it is almost beyond description. It is the site of an old coconut plantation and many of the original palm trees are still on the property. We were told that they planted over 1 million new plants and trees on the property (some 500 acres). The nature trails, golf course and beach are just something to behold. Although we didn't play a round of golf, we did go to the driving range/practice course and were able to hit golf balls without charge (we were given two sets of clubs and a golf cart at no charge). We also took out bicycles on a couple of days and biked around the entire property. It was just wonderful. Sailboats and kayaks are also available. My wife and I are avid tennis players and having a good tennis program is important to us. The St. Regis has two beautiful hard surface courts and we thoroughly enjoyed our time playing tennis everyday at the resort (there are three more planned). The tennis pro, Carl Gavine, is a superior teacher and pro and we took part in the daily clinics he conducts. We would highly recommend Carl, whether you are a beginner or an advanced player. He not only helps with technique, but he is very helpful with game strategy, either singles or doubles. The food at the St. Regis is excellent. The daily coffee is served free of charge. We ate at Fern, which is a Jean George Restaurant located at the St. Regis on two occasions. Although a bit pricey, it is as good as any restaurant in New York or LA. We also ate at Molasses, a restaurant at the golf course. It serves mostly Puerto Rican fare and it is also quite good. We did not eat at Seagrapes, the restaurant at the pool,but we heard from more than one couple that the food was quite good. Overall this is one of the finest resorts we have ever gone to. It is a service oriented hotel and it caters to all your needs. The staff is unbelievably friendly and attentive. Our advice is this: If you are looking for a Disney World or Atlantis type resort, this is not the place. Take the kids there. But if you are looking for a beautiful and secluded resort, with tennis, golf, bicycling, boating and beach, you have got to go to this place. You will not be disappointed.

However, we are very glad that we are staying here on points, because the service has some issues to work out if they are to justify their price point. A few issues to note (after staying less than 24 hours). --We sent an email to the hotel email 3 days before our stay asking about airport transfer options, and never received a reply --When forced to call on the day of our departure to address the same question, we were transferred to the concierge desk, which rang to a phantom no-name voicemail box twice. We had to call back to actually get someone to to talk to us. --The \"resort fee\" is a ridiculous revenue grab at $60 per day, which just inspires annoyance as the hotel itemizes a charge for things that are clearly fixed costs, like bicycle use and supposedly \"free\" wireless internet. --We had to sit in the lobby for 25 minutes waiting to check-in upon arrival, even though the hotel is relatively small we arrived after the prescribed check-in time --We were told that our butler would be available to make a \"welcome mojito\" (part of the $60 resort fee) at any time of our convenience, but when we called just before dinner to cash in on this option, we were informed that it would be at least a half an hour wait for him/her to come around --We sat down in the lounge by the pool restaurant to have a drink pre-dinner, and after recieving no notice from servers for 15 minutes, decided to go elsewhere --The marquee restaurant, Fern, which has Jean-Georges as its headline chef, was only ok. Food was tasty, but the menus were not in agreement (some things not available that were on one of our menus), they were out of multiple items, and the service was snooty and extremely fast (our entree arrived within 90 seconds of our very large appetizer being removed from our seat, and before we had come close to finishing our first wine pairing). For a restaurant at a hotel of this calibre boasting the JGV name, we were unimpressed. These all may sound like minor issues, but when taken as a whole in the first 24 hours of interacting with a hotel, it certainly creates the impression that this property does not have its act together. We've stayed at a number of great properties, both St Regis (New York, Rome, DC) and other great hotels (Oberoi properties, Singita, etc.), and we feel that this property has the setting and the decor top notch, but the value for money and overall experience are off given the lack of customer service polish. I would recommend the hotel only if people are planning to stay on points.

I will try to mention things that others haven't. LOCATION We drove from airport ourselves. We had no trouble at all. The highway toll road was first class. As you get to rio grande the traffic gets a little crazier. When you finally get on the country road it can get hairy. The resort is reachable by driving through cattle farms on a road that appears too narrow for two cars yet everyone goes 50 mph. A country road best served during the daylight. That being said, never got lost and used an iPhone turn by turn app with voice commands. I think it was x-drive. Walgreens is very nearby for some last minute deeds. As for car rentals, I recommend Hertz, avis of budget. They are at the airpor. Others like thrifty and dollar are pretty far away by shuttle. FOOD We only ate at the resort and at sea grapes and fern. Main tip is to be careful about of hours of operation as they are weird and change every day it seems. Sea Grapes, pool bar, was usually very good food with ample portions. Margaritas are fantastic. Sandwiches are great. Wife especially liked the gazpacho. We ate at Fern once. It was the best meal and on par with some of the superior choices back home in Chicago (like MK). Menu is small. But we had the filet and the salmon. But first was the amuse bouche of uffles and monk fish. Banana cake and chocolate cake were top notch. We wanted to ea outside and feel the breeze but the Mosquitos were horrible. It was the only place we ever saw one the entire five days. We asked to be reseated when they did without complaint. The bill was about $159 for two meals, two drinks, and desert. We didn't thi that was expensive for what we got. Lastly, room service one night. Chicken noodle soup was the best and a huge portion. Prawns were the biggest I have ever seen. Gnocci was over cooked/hard. BUTLER We called for the free coffee every morning. Usually took about thirty minutes but was tasty French press style. Also asked for them o come make us mojitos on the first night. Also free, but they were really bad so didn't ask again. Called them to borrow a DVD and the selection was very bad. Maybe ten choices all LAME. SERVICE We never met someone rude or not eager to help even when it was hectic. Always friendly. Ground crew, maids, waiters, butlers, etc. They called every day asking if we needed anything. Waitresses at the pool were always accessible and hustled for our orders. We also got the pool treats like frozen grapes or smoothies they hand out. They only thing to complain about is that the paper was only delivered three of five days. TIPS On the beach, watch out for broken glass once you leave the area right in front of the resort buildings. We found many sharp shards. The st Regis section was pristine. Use the gym. It's great with sweet televisions and net on each machine. Don't rush for the pool. Plenty of seats without being on top of peeps. The pool gets warmer in the afternoon. Never thought the temp was cold at all. QUESTION FOR YOU - TIPPING? Curious to hear what others think. Several times we were rebuffed by trying to tip the pool staff, valets. But they refused to accept. While another time a butler accepted. It was all very confusing about protocol. 18% is included in all food but beyond that didn't know what o do. Curious if here is a policy of them not accepting. COMPLAINTS Just one big one. The noise! The grounds are beautiful. But there was always someone with a gas motor working. Blowing debris off the walkways, power washing the sidewalks, etc. All five days. If they could spread that out a bit to maybe every other day would be nice.

What I found was an absolutely GORGEOUS place to stay with a couple fairly minor service issues, but overall a wonderful experience. First, the good: The hotel is beautiful, the setting is beautiful, the facilities are all beautiful. The room is extremely large and elegant - and we absolutely loved the terrace with its great couch. The spa was amongst the nicest we've ever been to, with great outdoor post-treatment area (where they brought us champagne after our massages). The setting for breakfast and both places for dinner were beautiful and we loved eating outdoors in January. The pool is a terrific place to read and relax. Even better - the grounds have terrific walking paths, an area where you can go \"boating\" (paddleboating and small sailboats) or fishing off the pier. The butler service (which somehow some people missed) was very gracious - they made us mojitos every night, they brought us DVDs, poured us a bath, etc. The bad: Okay, there were basically two issues we had - and most of it came upon check-in. When we arrived at 4:20 P.M., we were told our room wasn't ready. We responded that a St. Regis should have the room ready almost an hour and a half AFTER check-in time. After all, you are paying for the room after check-in time. The response from the receptionist was, \"I'm sorry, I know, but as I said, the room isn't ready.\" This wasn't really acceptable so we asked to see the manager, who came, typed in a few things and as it happens our room then suddenly became ready. The notion that a room isn't ready for customers paying this much after check-in time is pretty bad at a 5-star hotel. Moreover, when she asked us for dinner reservations - we made our selections, she agreed to them and said \"wonderful\" and then afterwards we noticed that some of the restaurants we chose were closed those evenings we chose them and she had no idea. Additionally, we were given a brochure that offered a promotion at the spa - but when we went to the spa it was clear that the promotion was expired and they checked with the manager before \"honoring\" it. Well, thanks for the favor, but next time don't hand out that brochure! Finally - we paid the resort fees which included (allegedly) treats by the pool, but we spent an entire afternoon by the pool and were offered nothing. Anyhow, these are all fairly minor quibbles in the context of a terrific 3-night stay at what was genuinely one of the nicest places we've ever stayed. Okay, so they're working out the kinks, but if you can swing it, it's well worth treating yourself. (p.s. as a side note - we stopped by for lunch at the Ritz-Carlton San Juan and have been to a couple other hotels on the island - there is no comparison.

Thankfully, it was a fine experience - not great and worth $1100 per nite plus charges but fine.

The pool and poolside restaurant SeaGrapes was the best managed of the resort facilities (as well as the spa). All the staff was quite poliye and friendly everywhere! However, concierge is the weakest (rarely answered the phone, was unaware of certain services that were prepaid or complimenary, didn't seem to communicate with the reception desk staff, etc.) Fern was very good but not excellent --- the staff was friendly but need more training AND needs a more visibile floor manager. Table cloths for dinner would improve the ambience and dim those lights in the main dining room.

Recommend some buildings be made \"Smoke free\" including outdoor spaces. All in all- this will become Puerto Rico's finest property in short time IF the GM reads and acts on these 55 plus reviews. They covered just about everything! Speaking of the GM - we were there for 7 days and saw him frequently but he never approached us.

With all the mixed reviews, we almost changed to another hotel. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad we did not. Although there are a few areas that could be improved, this property is very special. The grounds are amazing. From the moment you drive through the gated 400-acre property, you realize that this is not your average high-end resort. The property was sold out during our visit, but it seemed that the hotel was half full. With so much space to spread out, you never felt crowded by others. Staff: Overall, the staff was extremely friendly and a pleasure to deal with. The valet/bellmen were the best I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever experienced. All of them take such pride in their jobs and go above and beyond to make your vacation perfect. We never had to wait for them to get our car. We never opened a door. We never had to ask for anything\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they knew what we wanted! The butler staff was also amazing. In particular, Vanessa made our stay even better. One thing to remember is that the butlers are not \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcservants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. A lot of the complaints we have read on this site complain about the butler \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcservice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. If you pick up the phone and dial \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc0\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, they are ready to help you out with everything. But they do not stand outside your door and wait for you to say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOh, Jeeves\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6will you fetch me a glass of scotch?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The check-in process was great. Once the valet opens your car door, they escort you inside and ask if you would like some champagne. You then sit down in main room and wait for someone from the front desk to check you in. You are then driven to your room on a golf cart where your luggage has already been delivered. (Tip\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6ask the butler unpack for you. It was great to walk around the property and then come back to see all your clothes hung in the walk in closet or folded in the dresser) The pool staff was also very good. When you walk up to the pool, several people will great you and assist in finding a nice spot. Even with the hotel sold out, there was never an issue to find a nice quiet area around the pool\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6plenty of space. The only downside to the pool area was the expensive cocktails. I know this is a St. Regis, but cranberry vodka should not cost $14. The staff at the boathouse was excellent. You can tell they love their job and are happy to assist the guest. This is a hidden gem on this property. Most of the time we were the only people using the bikes/boats/fishing equipment. Be sure to take a bike and explore the property. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only way to see everything. The concierge is the weak point in this hotel. It was a struggle to get much info out of them. I called them several times and no one ever answered. And many of them seemed very unfamiliar with the local area. The valet/bellmen were the best to offer advice. There was a visiting concierge from the St Regis New York there helping the staff. Robert was excellent and obviously understands what guests expect from a top-notch concierge. Hopefully with his help, the rest of them can provide better service. Activities: The golf course is simply beautiful. Although $180 is expensive, it is worth every penny. You really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care what you shoot that day. You spend most of the time taking pictures at every bend of the fairway. Every hole is unique and perfectly landscaped. The last 3 holes are on the ocean and they make for a memorable finish. The staff at the course was excellent. The pool is first class in every way. The chairs are very comfortable and there are plenty of umbrellas for shade. The pool is NOT COLD!!! Pools are not hot tubs and are not meant to be bath water. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read many people talk about how the pool was too cold to get into. Plenty of people were in the pool and enjoying it while we were there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refreshing to jump into and cool off. The layout of the pool makes for a relaxing time. It winds thought the trees and landscaping. Even though there were a lot of kids, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t loud at all. The actual hot tub was oddly placed. It seems like it was an afterthought in the design. The beach was beautiful. The sand is not a white as some beaches. But you have miles of private beach to walk up and down. We took a long walk and saw 1 person the entire time. The water was about the same temperature as the pool\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6very refreshing. There are cabanas on the beach, but at $300/day, not a single one was rented out. I think the hotel might want to revisit the charge. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already mentioned the boathouse. They offer beach bikes, mountain bikes, paddleboards, kayaks, sailboats and fishing gear. Food: Overall, the food was great at the resort. I think the prices for food were very reasonable at Fern and Molasses. But the restaurant at the pool (Seagrapes) was overpriced. Fern is simply one of the best restaurants I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the privilege to dine. If you are a foodie, then you will love this place. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve written a full review of Fern\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you can see it via this LINK. http://www.10best.com/destinations/puerto-rico/san-juan/all/restaurants/fern-at-st-regis-bahia-beach/?search=fern The Tasting Menu with Wine parings is a must. And at just over $100/person, it is a decent value. Chef \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is very willing to answer any questions and is happy to make changes for personal preference. We saw him come out and talk with several Jewish families that keep Kosher. He was trained in NY and is very accommodating to special request. Our server, Joel, was excellent. Rooms: The rooms are huge and extremely well done. Everything from the outside courtyard, to the solid wood entry doors to the high-end fixtures made you realize the level of detail that went into the design. There is even a Subzero mini fridge at the wet bar. The bathrooms are huge, as people have mentioned. The tub is so big it takes about 10-15 minutes to fill. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth the wait! The bed was very comfortable. Our A/C was a little loud, but we enjoyed the white noise it provided. If this is a concern, make sure you ask for one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rooms. We were told they made some changes so the vent would not be so loud. I would also ask for a room on the top floor. These will have vaulted ceilings. We really enjoyed our balcony overlooking the golf course. But you might want to bring some bug spray, especially if you plan on sitting out there at night. Our main entry door was extremely hard to open because of a water leak in the roof. This caused the door jam to expand. We had to use both hands to open and use our whole body to close. They tried several times to fix this, but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help. Management should have offered to move us to another room. But we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let this bother us. Summary: Overall, this was a wonderful, relaxing vacation. With just a few small changes, this place will be a 5-diamond property. Right now, I would give it 4.5 diamonds. The people are so proud of their beautiful island and are so willing to share it with us. Every employee had a smile on his or her face. Even the grounds crew would stop working, turn off their equipment and say hello.

To begin, the staff's efforts have created a higher bar for all lodging in Puerto Rico. The St. Regis, Puerto Rico is the new First Class. This resort is for those that have watched other top branded hotels sell-out and build large facilities only for profits. When I am at a St. Regis I know the hotel is sacrificing some profits for me to enjoy a living experience that transcends me into a world of lavish accommodations with a little make believe sprinkled on top. When I am at a St. Regis I love to say, \"it's good to be the customer'. I will note to you that all I write is for good and while seem critical are meant to only improve the current landscape to continue to raise the bar. From the moment our driver drove us through the entrance gate last Sunday the experience was a pleasure. The bellmen were all very attentive to us and for the remaining of the week always knew our names as we would walk by the front door. The Check-In desk was a pleasure and more a feeling of a checking into an estate than a resort. Even though we did not wish to have champagne it was nice to have been offered. My additional suggestion here is a tropical fruit punch (with or without booze) as an option too and wet hand towel (on ice) to wipe the face and hands. The main hotel lobby is beautiful - so was the path in route to our room. The room was fantastic but the Butler idea was not sold well. We did not understand who to call and what the entire butler responsibilities really were when I checked in. I later found there were some perks but it was not made clear at room check in - he needs a card with his number and hand it to me at check in day to make it clear he is more than room service or the bellman.. Once I asked for room service to have breakfast served the next morning and I was forwarded to room service. I don't know who takes that order but I think the butler answers the phone when I pressed \"0\" and transfers me to room service. Coffee is free with the butler and at a cost with room service? I'm not sure of the entire thing and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great way to manage stand alone buildings like the resort is set up. Maybe something posted in the closet on the wall would help to explain this service? The bathroom was great...the hotel TV channel is locked in a channel that does not tell you anything about the resort - just one screen with some writing. I assume you are waiting for the tape to arrive to have it play on the hotel channel non-stop. There needs to be a channel directory card located in the bathroom too - preferably on the underside of the remote. The mirror TV was a great amenity. The balcony could use ceiling fans. The bed was fantastic. The phone and electronic controls were all the latest in technology and great stuff. I was not explained how to use the DVD player in the flat screen TV. There should also be a movie list directory - listing the DVD movies the resort has in stock. If I want to play a DVD however I read I had to request this and a list will be made available...why not leave the list in the room and update it (three ring binders - one page per DVD for easy updates). The subwoofer and center channel in the furniture below the TV did not work. The candles that were on a timer every night on the balcony were a great touch. AC seemed too loud - don't know how you can fix that but it worked well. The sound of the HVAC was a common comment on the blogs about the property too. The $5.00 delivery charge for room service on top of the 5% that is on top of the 18% for the waiters/room service.... that is a bit excessive. We headed to the pool and I felt the pool was run very well in all ways. However, it's only a matter of time someone will hurt their self without low lighting on the gravel paths to the pool - and the steps at the path to the pool from the villas. Once again the staff was trained well. They recognized that it was our first day and welcomed us and gave a short tour of the various areas and what is provided in each area - bar, restaurant, pool seating, the sun and where the sun rises and sets each day and how the chair choice would be affected during the day, the price of the cabanas (surprised there are not private showers behind each cabana - I see there is no room now for it), the lawn area below the pool, the beach and the beds on the beach...all well done. I would offer a free cabana for the guest first day (coupon given at check in) until the cabanas are being used more. The staff was good at introducing other staff when they would be temporarily gone or finishing their shift ....they also remembered our name each day. I also think the paths should have little hide-a-ways for a couple to sit alone or hammocks at various locations. The main Plantation House restaurant for breakfast was delicious. There needs to be some sticky buns on the breakfast menu in addition to the bread basket with the chocolate croissant, blueberry muffin (that was not a great muffin) and the bread with the powdered dusting of sugar. Great French toast and the pancakes were great too. Bacon was great as well. The sausage needs to be grilled and really cooked....seemed like it was thrown in the microwave and not on a grill. The fruit is ok but seemed not to be something to brag about...certain fruit was good and others were not so good. You have to figure out how to keep the fruit fresh....this is a blog comment as well. Dinner was excellent. Tablecloths could add to the night meal sessions, at the prices charged I would expect it. The cigar effort is played down too much. I only found out the arrangement too late in my stay. I saw the two humidors on the first floor of the Plantation House and the sitting area for cigar around behind the \"Check-In\" area. The restaurant at the golf course needs better marketing on days open.....the bonfire should be run more than just the weekend....maybe a fire pit people could set up their own beach side fire on slower nights??? Maybe torches or a big bonfire with chairs out on the lawn between the plantation house and ocean to look down from the restaurant. The beach need to be cleaned up from the trash that is washed up with the waves between the beach club and the resort...small trash...water bottles...but still trash all the same. When we went to the golf pro shop of the beach club it was clear we were off the property. The women were seemingly above the role of reaching out for help. This made the St. Regis look even better as service goes. We also went to the El Conquistador to see the facilities, service and food. Our cab driver 'Manning\" took us over there and we told him we would be a couple hours and he asked to wait to bring us back. I am glad we went to that hotel because it made us love the St. Regis all the more. The two hotels could not be more different and I am being kind. We both used the spa a couple times and were very impressed with the service and facilities. I had deep tissue rubs one day by Josephine and one day by Jose. Both massages were excellent and I normally have two massages a month so I know a good massage. They were not overly chatty - they were professional - they went beyond the level of service for what was consider a routine massage and were excellent. Don't ask who was better. The locker attendant was very nice too. He got out from behind the room he has his stuff set up and came to the locker room and asked if I needed anything and mentioned the chocolates laid out for my consumption....very good - champagne etc. He should explain more about what is outside though.....cold pool-hot tub - outdoor shower - sitting area and lemon water etc. Also, the hot water takes too long to get to those showers and he should turn the showers on for guests when they come out of their massage or ask if they wish to shower prior to their massage and turn on the shower. Offering a tour of the couples massage is a good idea after the massage to better sell it for the remaining week. The stock in that spa for sale is weak....more exercise products with the spa products would be a good thing for those who workout. Having a massage at the ocean would have been a nice thing too but this was not marketed.....there needs to be a hut for that for privacy at the beach. This needs marketing. I think the gift shop needed some more gifts items for kids to take home and that includes a basic tee shirt with the St. Regis on it. However, the St. Regis logo is WAY WAY to big on everything. Its tacky when it's that large....I don't want people to think I work here but I want to wear it when I am home or around my home (out to the club or to the store). On a business note-I had a small package I needed to go to the Governor during my stay and it was way too complicated to make happen. It also was going to charge $130.00 for the resort to deliver...way too much to charge for that and no Plan B suggested. The only idea was to give the package to a limo driver. I called a messenger company from the yellow pages and did it myself. I loved the new place and the people that are making it a grand experience for all the guests.

First of all, I was alittle concerned over some of the reviews, but I think they are improving on a daily basis and Starwood has strict brand standards that will be met. We wanted a relaxing place to enjoy our babymoon #2 and the St Regis met our expectations. We usually stay at 4-star properties, so we were in heaven, but if you only stay at 5-star properties (St Regis, Four Seasons, and Ritz) then your expectations may not be met 100%. Yes, there are a few things they need to improve, but I think some people that wrote reviews are nit-picking slightly. It's definately improved from the early reviews. Here are the strengths: - Property and grounds are amazing - over 500 acres to walk, bike, boat, golf, with lush tropical foilage that makes you feel secluded. - Rooms are huge with high-end touches - wet bar, monster bathroom with 2 showers and a tub, balcony with lounge furniture - Pool is 3 levels and plenty of space to relax. It's really not cold! - Butler service (this is a service - don't expect an individual butler 24/7, but they will bring you fresh coffee in the morning, comp mojitos, and even comp dvds so take advantage - Food was amazing - we live in Miami and have enjoyed the best Miami has and I can say Fern was so good, we ate there all 3 nights. Try the Grouper! The wine list is great too. We loved having lunch at Seagrapes - you can eat at the pool, at the bar, or at a table with amazing views of the ocean. Be sure to eat at Fern for breakfast - everything is great. - Spa was probably the nicest I've seen - beautiful and huge. Plenty of space and things to do. - They have great free events each night. We had a wine tasting on Thursday, and on weekends they have a sabering with free champagne. - Beach is HUGE and they have plenty of chairs and umbrellas - keep in mind this is Jan so it gets windy on the beach and the surf is rough. Here are the weaknesses: - Some reviewers complained the a/c was too loud - it was not too loud for us and we were in bldg 7, but you will be able to hear it run. - The pillow options should be better - down is fine for some but we like firm pillows which were hard to find (took them 45 min to replace the pillows) - Cocktails are alittle steep at $15. They should offer more choices at a lower price. A beer is $7. - Service is not up to a 5-star resort but they are getting better - we talked to many staff members about this and they are getting trained and building confidence - they are aware of the reviews. Come on, they just opened Nov 6. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone - my wife is on the phone right now gushing about this place to her friend. I want to go back next year because I know the service will be even better. One last thing about getting a car - if you stay 3 nights or less then get a car. It will be cheaper than a taxi. It only takes 30 min and the valet is $22. If you stay for 4 nights or longer, then get the taxi unless you want to go off property. We only did once, but you will want to drive back fast.

Given some of the poor reviews I've read, I was prepared to be (very) disappointed. Overall, the experience was very good and, given the staff's general willing and friendly attitude, I think that the resort will probably achieve it's full potential if there is a little more focus on a few small things. What's great: 1. The rooms 2. The grounds 3. The staff really wants to be helpful 4. One of the nicest spas I have seen--beautiful aesthetically and the first time I have been offerred champagne while I wait for a treatment. Highly recommend. 5. With one exception where we waited for tea to be delivered for 45 minutes, the butler service was attentive and prompt. What's so-so: 1. The prices. Nothing is cheap here ($22 hamburgers, etc.). That said, I think the prices are pretty close to what you would find at other St. Regis, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton hotels. 2. The restaurants: Food is fine but generally not spectacular. I tried all 3 and all 3 were good but not great. 3. The beach: The beach is nice and very private but it is definitely not the most amazing beach in the world. The quality of the sand is ok but not powdery soft and the surf can be rough (parents of small children should be cautious). What could use improvement: 1. When we checked in at around 1:30pm, our room was not ready, which I am fine with given that checkin is at 3pm. We were told to leave our cell phone number and they would call once the room was ready. At 4pm, we still had not heard anything and went back to the front desk. We were given a room at that point but there was no great explanation as to why we hadn't been called earlier. 2. Pool/beach service can be uneven. For two days, we had a great server who made regular rounds to see what we needed. On the third day, it was almost impossible to get served. 3. We had read about the $60 resort charge and knew to expect it. That said, a property of this caliber should not be adding a resort charge. If they need the extra $60, please add it to the room rates. It feels a little sleazy. 4. Gratuity added automatically. For almost anything, the hotel automatically adds a 18-20% gratuity. That is certainly not standard practice in the US and I find it a little presumptuous. 5. No newspaper even though we were supposed to receive it daily. 6. While I did not find the pool to be frigid as some reviewers have posted, it was a little on the cold side--it should be heated. What we did not evaluate: 1. Golf 2. Housekeeping: Given the horror stories, I decided to call when I left the room. The room was always made up when we returned. Evening turndown service was provided each night without me asking. 3. Concierge: we did not use their services", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cOverall great stay ... But not just quite there yet.\u201d", "Author": "Ironlungs", "ReviewID": "UR93236610", "Content": "My wife and I recently stayed at the St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort in Puerto Rico for 5 nights from January 6th - 11th. To provide some background/context for this review, we are in our early 30s and planned this vacation specifically for relaxation purposes while our 2 year-old daughter remained at home with my in-laws. We do stay at high-end resorts but by all means, it is not always a necessity. Overall, we had a wonderful time at the St. Regis and it is a place that we would recommend quite highly; the amenities were excellent, the activities available are varied and the property is beautiful, expansive, unique, secluded and intimate. From what we have seen, this is also a very family friendly resort with sources of outdoor entertainment for young children. In fact, there were many couples visiting with young kids and teenagers; therefore, if you have issues with kids at the pool side or children at the dinner table (no matter how fancy it is), you will surely be disappointed. Personally, we did not mind it a bit having been in that situation before and we actually appreciated the laid back atmosphere. Despite the fact that we had a great overall experience, there were inconsistencies within our stay that still need to be resolved by the management and I will address this at the end. After reading some of the earlier mixed and negative reviews here, we were admittedly apprehensive. However, it is apparent that the staff and management have perhaps reviewed the feedback and criticism and have made efforts to rectify the majority of the issues that earlier guests have pointed out. In terms of the resort itself, it is expansive, quiet, intimate and quite beautiful. There are various activities available on the premises including kayaking, fishing, golfing and tennis. This is clearly a place meant for those people who want to have a quiet and peaceful time for relaxation and reading by the beach or pool. If you get bored easily or if you require entertainment, this may not be the right place for you. We were perfectly content. In terms of transportation, there is reportedly a car service available to take you from and to the airport for $120 each way. My understanding is that there are taxis/transportation services from the resort to San Juan as well although I do not know the cost. We rented a car through Enterprise for 5 days for $120 flat. Of course, there is a $20/night valet fee for parking at the St. Regis; therefore, the cost of renting vs. using their services is a wash in my opinion. If I had to do it over again, I probably would not have rented a car given that we used it only for 1 day to travel to San Juan and ended up wanting to spend as much time as we could at the resort itself. For families with kids, it may make some sense to rent a car to acquire supplies at the local supermarket (Ralph's) given the price of simple products such as milk or juice at the resort. In addition, the drive is quite simple and straightforward. The rooms quite nice with enormous showers and a soaking tub. We stayed in a room with a garden view with a private balcony. There are Ocean View suites available as well but because we arrived during a week where the resort was booked, there were no opportunities to upgrade but definitely ask. In terms of food, there are three restaurants at the resort: 1. Seagrapes 2. Fern 3. Molasses (Located by the golf course; we did not dine here). Menus are all available online. Seagrapes is located by the pool and overlooks the beach. Lunch is very relaxed, laid-back and 'beachy' whereas dinner is a bit more formal and a live band provides entertainment. The lunch menu is quite eclectic and consists of flat bread pizzas (very good -- the piquant sausage w/ garlic was excellent), salads and sandwiches. The dinner entrees consisted of various seafood items including halibut, grouper, and salmon. Wagyu steak was an option as well. Lunch items range from $17-$26 while dinner entrees range from $24-38. Cocktails are $15 which is the typical cost of a drink at a NYC hotel bar so albeit pricey, not unexpected for us. By the way, the cocktails are incredible. To summarize, the lunch options are great for a day at the beach but dinner is 'average' at Seagrapes. Fern is Jean-George's restaurant at the resort which consists of 'fusion' contemporary cuisine. The atmosphere is a bit more sophisticated but not stuffy. Meals can be eaten either inside the dining room or outside on the balcony overlooking the main lawn and the ocean. During the day, the ocean breeze and view really made our breakfast and brunch absolutely perfect. At Fern, the brunch and breakfast is not to be missed --- I ordered Eggs Benedict over smoked salmon every day; it was definitely the best meal of the day but the view played a large role. Dinner was good and consistent. It was definitely not the best cuisine we've had (we lived in NYC for many years so we have been to some great places) but it was consistent, well seasoned, and satisfying -- nothing particularly special. Service was spotty at times (waiters not filling the water, incorrect items on our bill, providing dessert menus in a very untimely manner etc.) but our waiter did thank us for our patience at one point without prompting and even though this was a small gesture, it went a long way for me. We ordered Room Service two of the nights because we could not get reservations at Fern and did not want to have dinner at Seagrapes every night. One reviewer commented that the menu 'was a joke' which I didn't understand as it appears to be very similar to other high-end resorts and hotels in general. The menu is similar to that of Seagrapes including red snapper ceviche, burgers, grilled salmon, gnocchi, etc. The food was mediocre and the portion size was a bit small. However, it's room service --- I have low expectations to start. The only issue I had was the staff fielding the orders --- the first night, the woman taking our order was excellent and knew the menu quite well, even items not on the menu. During the second night, the woman taking our order was clueless. As noted previously, be prepared to pay for extra fees associated with room service --- this includes a $5 delivery charge and a 22% service charge + tax (17% of the service charge goes into the tip) Final Recommendations/Advice for Food at your stay at the St. Regis: 1. Request 'butler' order morning coffee to be delivered at a specific time to your door on a daily basis rather than using the in-room coffee markers. We learned about this from previous reviewers on Tripadvisor. It is complimentary and 100 x better given that it is made in a French Press. Coffee over your terrace or ocean view is the best way to start the morning. 2. Seagrapes is excellent for a satisfying meal at the beach or poolside. Be aware that a 18% tip is already included into the bill; Our server was kind of enough to point this out the first day we arrived. 3. Consider going to Fern for breakfast or brunch every morning --- it's worth it both for the food and ambience; Dine on the terrace overlooking the ocean; I regret that we did not do this from day one. 4. Consider going to Fern for most of your meals --- Seagrapes became tiresome after a while. I would skip out on room service. If I had to do it all over again, I probably would've skipped dinner at Seagrapes and proceeded to go to dinner every night at Fern instead (if there are openings; BTW - you can book reservations through Open Table and it is encouraged that you do so ahead of time; we didn't think when we first arrived that reservations would be necessary at all but we were wrong. Overall, the cost difference is neglible and the food is much superior than that of Seagrapes. Spa: My wife received a prenatal massage at $165. There have been complaints about the cost but when we used to live in NYC, this was the typical cost of a 1 hour massage at the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa so we did not think that it was unreasonable for a resort (in contrast to that of the Mandarin Oriental where it can be around $250 per hour). Per her report, she had a wonderful experience. Apparently, from the outside, it is rather inconspicuous but upon entering, it was beautiful, comfortable, and luxurious ... this is coming from some one who has had many massages in her lifetime. \"Well worth it\" was her comment. Main Issues/Complaints: Overall, we were happy with our stay. However, there are clearly some issues that still need to be sorted out. We felt that the service was overall excellent and the staff was extremely friendly. I think that many of the concerns initially raised by reviewers have been fixed (for the most part) regarding 'clueless' staff. I found them to be quite responsive and will likely improve with a bit more time. 1. The issue regarding the air conditioning unit has been mentioned by previous reviewers and it really is a serious problem. Whoever made the decision on the air conditioning really should be fired. The management should seriously consider re-installing or re-working the A/C because it is extremely loud, to the point where my sleep was hindered. Given the humidity, A/C is essential and I enjoy sleeping in silence or gentle background noise. This A/C unit is akin to a jet plane engine (a bit of hyperbole but really, not overly so) 2. Spotty and inconsistent service with clean-up by the suites. We didn't experience the housekeeping others did. We had our beds cleaned, shampoo replenished and beds turned out in the afternoon. One issue that I had was various laundry baskets left in the hallway and the fact that our breakfast coffee trays were left outside our door ... all day. It appeared at times that no know knew who was truly responsible for the pick-up. The 'little things' do matter. Final Impression/Recommendations: The St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort provided us everything that we wanted in a vacation. It is an amazing property with excellent service, food and ambience. It is quiet, relaxed, and private. We had a great time and would recommend it to friends and family members ... however, this is a recommendation with a caveat: If you are in need of being entertained (live entertainment, lots of activities, exciting adventures, etc.) this is not the place for you. If your goal is to relax, play some tennis and golf, go for a bike ride or to kayak, read by the pool or beach, and to enjoy some wonderful cuisine and ambience, this is the perfect place. If you have children, it is indeed family friendly and would be a great vacation spot for teenagers and younger children (the staff is very open to having kids around; I can't say the same for the guests) Finally, if you are the type of individual who demands exceptional service and consistently stay at 'the best places possible' I am certain that as is, it will not live up to your expectations and you will be disappointed. For those who are a bit more laid back, I do think that with a little more time and a few additional adjustments, the staff and the amenities will improve and it will be a truly great place to stay in Puerto Rico.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cI wanted to stay longer...\u201d", "Author": "KM_Borowski", "ReviewID": "UR93197185", "Content": "Amazing staff - bellman, butler and pool employees were friendly and helpful.

As we have visited other SR properties and are big fans of the brand, we were looking forward with great anticipation to experiencing this newest property. I am sorry to report, however, that the hotel fell far short of expectations and that I cannot recommend it to other like-minded travelers. This is a pity, certainly, since the resort grounds and public spaces are beautiful and the rooms gorgeous. Most significantly, the service culture is not up to SR standards. I frequently felt as if my requests (none of which were unreasonable) were met with resentment\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not in an overt or aggressive manner but more subtle and guised. Examples\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 - We never met our butler. In fact, I think the entire butler program at the hotel is a giant myth and is merely an equivalent of calling the front desk at any other hotel (on multiple occasions a call to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153butler\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was never even picked up\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the phone just kept ringing); - I received room service 90 minutes after placing my order, and after I had already called to cancel (after waiting for 45 minutes); - Valet failed to get my car even with 20 minutes notice; - I had to request a high chair tray three times at breakfast until one was actually brought over; - Only a handful of staffers seemed to know anything about the hotel or the surrounding area: if you asked three people for directions anywhere, whether within or outside the hotel, you were likely to receive three different answers; - When I asked for an extra umbrella to be set up by us on the beach, I was told this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible, since they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153had already dug the holes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and this despite the fact that the beach was sparsely populated and there were plenty of umbrellas for the taking. A different attendant, sensing my frustration, finally brought over a second umbrella. Aside from its service culture, the hotel also needs to address two other major shortcomings: - The pool isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heated! At a resort as isolated as the SR, where there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much to do but lounge by the pool, it needs to be swimmable. Instead, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely freezing (at least in January when temperatures hover around 80). - The food outside of Fern (the Jean-Gorges restaurant) is mediocre. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Caesar salad with baked crisp\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd consisted of bagged lettuce, boxed croutons, and bottled dressing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and with a $17 price tag. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re better off renting a car and sampling the local mofongo; all-in-all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a wash money-wise and a more tasty experience. The majority of the clientele for this hotel consists of Manhattanites, who are discerning and demanding by nature (and, being one, I have no shame in saying this).

The attention to details in the magnificent rooms were extraordinary and the warmth of the staff was very much welcome.

Of course that there are some small things that the Hotel has still to get together, which I would think are normal for such a new property, but the overall experience was definitely extremely memorable and positive.

I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T!!!!! I don't know who is writing those reviews, but I am a Starwood Preferred Guest who travels frequently and only stays at luxury 5 star resorts. I admit that I am very fussy and extremely particular. From the moment \"Joel\" picked us up at the airport in a beautiful mercedez limo to the moment we checked out we were treated like royalty. As soon as we arrived, Maria the concierge arranged for all of our dinner reservations and excursions. The room was amazing....the bathroom shower was large enough to fit 5 people with a rainshower head. There was a TV built into the mirror over the bathroom sink..I've never seen that before!! The products were fantastic..Spa shampoos, conditioners..exfoliants..lotions..2 types of soap...loufa sponges and loufa brushes, and more. The quality and quantity was wonderful...The butler service (Vanessa and Luisa) was very helpful arranging for carts to take us to the resort restaurants, as well as serving us coffee & tea in the morning & evening (at no charge). She also brought us a selection of DVDs to choose from (at no charge). Each evening when we returned to our room, our bed was turned down and soft music was playing. We had a lovely terrace with table, chairs and a sofa to relax on with a great view of the foliage. When we arrived at the beach/pool the staff (Luis) immediately found us lounge chairs with umbrellas and laid out towels for us (not having to awaken at 7am to secure chairs like at other hotels!) The ocean was swimmable and the pool was beautiful, however not heated. I would have preferred a heated pool, however I was able to relax in the Jacuzzi which was a great temperature. The exercise equipment was top notch. The food was excellent...we had breakfast at Ferns, lunch at Seagrapes by the pool and dinner at Molasses (where I ordered Mufongo at the suggestion of \"Joel\"..it was fabulous!!) We are fussy eaters and the chef accomodated all our special food requests. I would like to address the issue that many people have with the prices...If you travel and stay at luxury or even mid-rate hotels you must know that hotel food is generally pricey.. You can always see the menus on-line before you book your reservation so you know what the pricing is... The food was excellent and the service top-notch..every and I mean every staff member we passed always had a smile on their face and a warm greeting. The front desk was extremely helpful when we needed to change our flight home to avoid the predicted blizzard in New York...while we were away enjoying the evening biolumenescent kayak tour, she waited for us to return at 11 PM to inform us that all the arrangements had been made!! Another example of the quality of service is when I was taking a photo by the magnificent infinity pool at the entrance to the main lobby. One of the bellhops noticed that there was a car parked in the background and without being asked..he moved the car so it wouldn't be in my picture!!!!! I was curious to find out if other guests felt the same way about their stay as I did, so I asked a woman who was leaving what she thought..she said she enjoyed her stay so much that she was returning in March!!! We also ran into an acquantance while we were there and he was also very impressed with the resort..they had upgraded him to a suite!!! In conclusion...I'd like to say that I only take the time to write a review if I feel strongly about where I've stayed.. I do want to mention that there is no casino or night activities so you would have to take a taxi to another place if that's important to you.(They do have a beautiful golf course, driving range and free boating and biking)....As I sit writing this review..looking at the snow outside...I'm thinking..maybe I shouldn't have changed that flight after all..it would have been wonderful to have one more day of warm weather and pampering!!!", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellesley, MA", "Title": "\u201cA Perfect Paradis\u201d", "Author": "Exeterbos", "ReviewID": "UR92715534", "Content": "I have traveled to many places in the World but never have I seen anything like the St Regis Bahia Beach. While visiting friends in Puerto Rico, we had an opportunity to visit and stay at the St Regis, Bahia Beach in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico. We had been to the resort previously, to play golf with friends; however, the hotel was still under construction and had not opened. On this trip we were determined to see the facility and enjoy the offerings. We zipped down to Rio Grande on the Autopiste from San Juan . In some 20 minutes we were at the front door of the Resort, welcomed by some of the friendliest and helpful faces I have ever seen at a hotel. Bags collected and car whisked off by the Valet, we were escorted past the fire pits lining the front walkway to the Concierge for check in. Glass of champagne, Mimosa while we were taken through a pleasant registration process (remember those?), then introduced to our Butler who was to take us to our room. Normally, a bellman will escort you and your baggage to the room and it can be an experience ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime. Not at the St. Regis. Off in a golf cart you go, with the love of your life at your side, and you plunge into the jungle on a boardwalk (to protect the flowers and the fauna) and thence to your room. Very well done! One begins to unwind on the cart, pulses slowing down to match the mood of the jungle. Then in no time, literally, you pull up to your casita, and out you go, up to the room (by the way, it was a quick, simple walk from the casita to the main building Plantation House, but I would not have missed that ride for the world). Ah, what a room it is, as the Butler (who was terrific and if you have never experienced a great butler you are in for a treat. If you have one at home you may want to kidnap one of theirs) introduced us to the room and its various amenities, we were both astonished. I believe that the entry hall to our room was larger than my first apartment and certainly nicer looking. We regularly stay at five star hotels, but this room, and it was a standard room we reserved, not a suite, was an absolute show stopper, all around. We were first introduced to the sleeping area. The bed was a king and a beauty. St. Regis really does understand that the prime function of a guest room is for sleeping and relaxing while on vacation, and , the bed is critical. We are pleased to report that we lasted all of five minutes that evening once under the covers and the comforter (yes, a comforter) and slept like there was no tomorrow. However, sleep was for later, at this point we were still exploring light switch central (all controlled bedside, including the TV which is enormous and provides easy viewing from the bed, if one were able to say awake long enough once in that comfy environment. Opposite the bed, the bar. Not your typical mini bar for the St. Regis. Not at all. First, we saw the ingredients for mixing our own mojitos, including fresh mint (and a mortar and pestle to grind it with) as well as the appropriate liquors. Additionally, there were at least three types of chocolate, certainly enough to satisfy any late night cravings and a few bottles of champagne to wash the chocolate down, should one desire to do so. I did. Then there is the bath room (two words) large enough to accommodate a Celtics Game. His and her sinks were in full force, with a mirror in which one could view one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorite news/sports/cable program while shaving or washing up (why not-just like home) and then on to the bathing area. One wall of the bathing area (and it is quite generous) was a rain shower/ hand shower combination that proved delightful and worked perfectly. Opposite this marvel was a soaking tub that could accommodate a small aircraft carrier, and, was indeed the delight of Milady. There is a private toilet which, I must report is not only ventilated beautifully, but does not cause one to experience claustrophobia in the slightest. After unpacking, turning on and off all the electronics in the room, we left for dinner at Jean Georges. I do not know if you have had dinner at jean Georges in New York, reputed to be the best restaurant in a city replete with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurants. I can only say that the night we ate at Jean Georges at the St Regis, it was perfect. Not kidding. Perfect. The service was unbelievable (remember, we were nothing special, just a couple of oldsters with a penchant for good wine and food). We were absolutely blown away with the quality of food, and the ambiance of the facility. The service was some of the best I have ever received this side of Asia and the staff as friendly as one would like. After a dinner, in a restaurant overlooking the ocean, we went back to our room and thence goodnight. Ah, but the next day, the next day. We were up and at em in the morning with breakfast on the upstairs terrace of the Hotel (Jean Georges serves breakfast). Hot coffee (Puerto Rican of course) and fresh hot croissants with butter and off to golf. Now, I have found that if one is at a resort and there is an ocean, a pool and golf along with a reasonable restaurant, and a good room, I am a happy man. Rarely does one find that four are top notch, seldom all five. Well, Bahia is a five for five. If you are a golfer, you will love the course. There are only a handful of courses that have finishing holes on the Ocean and they, at least in my knowledge, can cost more than a down payment on a Ferrari. The golf course here is not only challenging, it is without doubt, the most beautiful course upon which I have ever played. Ever. And it is now firmly my world favorite. If you like Ocean, the entire resort sits on one. I mean you can simply walk across the pool or the restaurant right into the ocean, clearer and bluer than anything I have seen this side of Greece. Sensual, warm and inviting, the water literally envelopes you in its magic and its power. You will not be disappointed. After all, this is a resort in which one may relax or just be in love. I am not a pool person, not will I ever be one. But one can sun here to their heart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content by the pool, dip in the water to refresh and still hear the rush of the sea a few steps away. Not bad, eh? I must also take a moment to applaud the developer. Everywhere you look, you see the care and love this individual has taken in the creation of this magnificent, world class resort. One cannot but help to be impressed that such a spectacular development was created , while all the while taking into great concern the environment and the animals that inhabit it (yes, there are birds and creatures everywhere, if one takes the time to look and see them) in juxtaposition with us. Puerto Rico now has a destination within a destination that sets the standard for what a top end resort should be. If I were you and my significant other was beginning to feel the doldrums of winter, I would suggest the following. Make a reservation at the St Regis, book a couple of tickets and surprise the love of your life with a few days in Paradise. I can assure you the reward will be worth it.

My in-laws joined us for a day and a night. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll start with the good news. The food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while it disappointingly does not reflect Puerto Rican culture in any way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was well prepared, though wildly overpriced (as is consistently noted on Trip Advisor). We were upgraded and the room was well designed, clean and altogether pleasant. In the spirit of being constructive, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve organized my feedback into suggestions for the General Manager to improve the resort. They are: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Intensively train and re-train your staff. They are nearly without exception pleasant, smiling and enthusiastic. They are also woefully undertrained. Waitresses don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the menu and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer questions. Receptionists are slow and awkward. Our waiter at breakfast was overwhelmed by basic service: he gave us no water (we asked repeatedly), got no milk for my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coffee (we asked repeatedly), and it took three requests to get our check. This pattern repeated itself over and over: nice employees without skills and seriously lacking a sense of urgency. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Improve the check-in process. My wife and I waited more than 30 minutes, and my in-laws an outrageous 2+ hours to check in. The supercilious formality of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sit down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the receptionist is both onerous and inefficient. We just want our key, not a briefing. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Ensure rooms are available on time. We waited an hour for our room and my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parents waited over 2 hours. On both occasions we were informed that the room was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153still being prepared.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Completely revisit your staffing model. We waited over an hour on two occasions for coffee from the supposedly instantaneous butler service; fortunately there were always four or more people at the front door and three or so greeters at the pool. I played golf and called for a shuttle when finished: after half an hour without it showing up I walked back to the hotel to discover two shuttle carts and abundant staff standing around the front door ready to dispense enthusiastic greetings. This is completely mismanaged personnel utilization. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Clean and groom the beach. As noted on many Trip Advisor posts, the beach is dirty. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a nice beach with its mud brown sand, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beyond your control. The profusion of glass (dangerous) and other trash is well within your purview, and we observed detritus on the beach nearly every day. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Kill the omnipresent soundtrack. The throbbing head music and Musak on the speakers that pervade every nook of the property are annoying. Worse, they actually kept my father-in-law awake when he tried to sleep with the patio door open. The resort presents itself as a bastion of natural beauty, then insists on drowning out the coqui frogs and other sounds of nature with house music. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Keep the restaurants open. Sea Grapes restaurant was sometimes open, sometimes not. I assume it was closed when you judged hotel occupancy to be too low to support both it and Fern. Regardless, predictability is always helpful to guests trying to plan for meals. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Improve poolside and beachside service. Poolside service needs to be much more diligent. Compared with the St Regis in Punta Mita where we stayed last May it is lacking in both attention and graciousness. When we wanted something we had to search for a waiter. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Heat the pool. One felt like a Titanic survivor jumping into it, which naturally resulted in a nearly empty pool for our entire stay. Hard to see how you miss this one. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Put screens on the patio doors. Seriously, you have no screen doors on the patios in the tropics! The mosquitoes are grateful. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work on the grounds first thing in the morning. Yes, industrious gentlemen were out using powered tools to cut vegetation and trim at 7:30 am. Spectacular wakeup. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Mark Route 187 so people can find the resort. I know road signs aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your responsibility, but we spoke to numerous people (including my in-laws) who drove by the resort more than once trying to find it \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Embrace Puerto Rico. As I mentioned, my wife and I stayed at the St. Regis Punta Mita and they have the same odd model: try to make the experience as culturally anonymous as possible, with an experience that replicates some island of Americana but for the accents of the employees. Why a Vongerichten restaurant instead of a high-end eatery focusing on local Puerto Rican cuisine? Why did the concierge (Kerryann?) direct my wife and me to Pasions at the grotesque Trump resort when we repeatedly asked for an authentic, local restaurant? Why did she put down local culture in her recommendation commentary? \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Management needs to get out there and see what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on. My father-in-law mentioned it first: you never see a manager walking around or soliciting feedback from guests.

We loved the hotel and we loved the beautiful weather. The hotel is lovely and the grounds are expansive. All the staff is very friendly. We loved the pool and the resort is right on the beach. We soaked in the sun, read books and went for several walks on the nature trails. We also enjoyed the spa. It opened this past November and although we loved our stay, there were a few kinks they need to work out.... but these kinks would definitely not keep me from going back. Room for improvement: 1. the shower in our room was huge (I didn't measure but about 11 by 11) but the water on both the rain shower nozzle and the shower head came out in a trickle. The water pressure is very low....if part of a luxury vacation for you includes a hot, steamy invigorating shower, you may need to pass on the hotel...maybe they were trying to conserve water? 2. The main dining room filled up for dinner reservations prior to our arrival. We were able to secure reservations for 9 pm the second night of our stay and, once we arrived, the hostess was flustered and said the kitchen was backed up and our dinner would be delayed.....it turned out okay but the dining room was only half full and it was one of only two options available for dinner....we ate in the dining room only once. The other options for food are the poolside restaurant which was actually very good and the golf area restaurant which has limited hours. We also ordered room service one night and it was good. As an aside, soft drinks are $5.00 each and each refill is the same...there is nowhere to purchase a soft drink except at one of the restaurants, the bar or the room refrigerator...they neglected to refill my room refrigerator after the first night and I am a Diet Coke addict so I had to go to the main lobby bar at 8 am each morning and order my $5.00 diet coke. Also, don't make the mistake of eating the tiny canister of chocolate covered raisins(or any of the other treats for that matter) in the room--that will set you back $17.00! 3. I was a little disappointed in housekeeping... I came back to the room at noon the first day and made a point of pushing the button to make sure we had our room serviced. I really like to come home to a straightened hotel room after a day of vacation...we arrived back at the room at 4 and still no housekeeping service.. I called and they came right away and the rest of the visit was much better. However, we did not receive turn down service except our last night and we were offered turn down service at 10:30 pm! Someone knocked on the door a few minutes after I had given a twenty dollar tip to the tv repair man and wanted to give us turn down service. We told them through the door that we were not interested. We never got our ice bucket refilled--even after I called and asked for a refill. I still would go back and plan to take my husband.

We saw that the physical plant has the capability to deliver at a very high level. But the service! We couldn't have been more disappointed. Disappearing butlers, absent management, so much staff just standing around. There were plentiful greeters at the resort entrance but then none of them able to transport us to our distant room by golf cart (the only option apart from a long walk). Our concierge gave us wrong information on the resort's New Year's events. Also rented a car through the concierge and were told we could have done it cheaper on-line. Maps provided to local attractions and destinations were lifted from other resorts in locations distant from this one. Our room wasn't made up during the day on multiple occasions, with spotty turn-down service as well. Details were not attended to, specifically replacement of used items in the room such as glassware, robes, and some weren't provided at all, such as creamer for the coffee if you chose to use the coffeemaker in the room. Television options were disappointing as well. No HBO, etc. The spa experience was very nice and availability of services was good but very pricey. Regarding dining options on the property: prices charged for breakfast buffet for two at Seagrapes Restaurant ($88 with built-in service fee) was outrageous, and wine prices shocking ($60 for a bottle of wine we pay $18 for at home plus 22% service charge, 7% sales tax, and $5 delivery charge!). No water sports available at the beach at all. The surf was very rough and we never saw the aqua center open at any time during our stay. Since the pool was too cold for swimming, it seemed to force the children on the property into the small hot tub. It was filled with kids every time we ventured by. Pool cabana prices were crazy. We inquired about rentals and were told that they were $150 for a half day for a small cabana. Didn't bother to price a family cabana but at the price we were quoted for the small understood why they were all empty. Getting back to one's room at night on the beach side of the property was very challenging as there was no lighting whatsoever. We solved this by using the flashlight app on our i-phones.

Well, only in price they compete. People from St Regis should spend a few nights in Amanyara (Turks and Caicos) or in any BanyanTree hotel and learn how to manage a luxury property...but let's go from the good to the bad: The good: the hotel is new, facilities are great and rooms are very spacious and well equipped. If you're a golfer this may be the right hotel for you since they have a gorgeous course. The not-so-good: the grounds are beautiful but location is not the best since this is the wettest and windiest area of Puerto Rico. The beach, although private, is not very good. The sand is dark and so is the water. Also, the ocean is quite rough so swimming or snorkeling is dangerous. The bad: 1. The swimming pools. it's beyond my understanding how they invested so many millions in building this resort and did not invest a few thousands in a temperature control system for the pools. The swimming pools are so cold that are always empty. And I mean freezing cold. I mean bone pain cold. So, if the sea is rough and pool is unusable - what kind of beach resort is this? 2. Food. For the price I expected superior, memorable food. That\u00c2\u00b4s not the case. Everything is too spicy, menus are very short and there are no daily specials for a change. Also the room service menu is a joke. 3. Service. I have to say that every single member of the staff was very friendly to us. That sort of compensates their inefficiency. We asked 3 times, 2 days in a row to replace our bath amenities that were finished. We asked the maid, asked the butler - the answer is always affirmative but nothing happens! When you call the concierge, you always get a voicemail to leave your message. You leave a message and nothing happens. I left a message to book table in main restaurant and never got answered back. I asked for assistance with the video on demand system - the butler service said they would send an engineer; we checked-out 3 days later and never saw the engineer. As asked twice for a taxi to take us back to airport at 2pm. Guess what: 2pm departure day and had to wait another 20 minutes for the taxi... 4. Resort fees. I don't want to sound arrogant, but if I'm paying 1000USD a night in high season to stay in a hotel, why do I have to pay another 60USD for wi-fi and towel service (the \"resort fee\")??

I do understand that they have only been open for three months but there is no excuse for the level of service that has been displayed during our stay. I can honestly say that this is one of the most unpleasant experiences we have ever had on vacation, which is very unfortunate. We came with to the St Regis with the best of intentions to enjoy a much needed vacation from new york city and have are truly saddened that we chose this resort. We chose the St Regis because of the short flight time from New York. As we are traveling with friends and a 2 toddlers, we thought the flight time would be just right. That turned out to be a easy experience, checking in not-so-much. Before we arrived, I called 3 times to ensure that we would have cribs for the kids and adjoining rooms. When we arrived at 3 PM we were told our rooms were being finished and would be ready in 20 minutes. 2 1/2 hours later we were still waiting to get into our rooms. Once we did get into our rooms at 5:30, there were no cribs That proved to take 4 more hours and several calls to the \"butler\" and a $60 tip to make it happen. At arox 10 pm we had make shift pack and plays with no sheets set up in our rooms. Upon waking the next morning we learned that the only restaurant on site that is open mon-wed for Breakfast and dinner was the Fern. Again when I called several times prior to our arrival to inquire about dining situations for the kids, I was told there were two additional casual restaurants open daily. Certainly not the case. We ordered a glass of whole milk for room service this morning for my daughter and it was $14.38. Seriously, I speak the truth. As for dining, we had dinner at the Fern last night, we hired a sitter to watch our children so they wouldn't disturb other guest while dining. Again a waste since it is the only restaurant open, it was packed with children running around, crying, playing and chasing each other through the dining room while we attempted to enjoy our $375 dinner. Not exactly the romantic setting that is detailed online. The food is decent, but there are no award winners here. It is certainly not worth raving about. As for general service, there is absolutely no organization, follow through or training of the staff. We asked 4 people where the kids club was and not one person was able to tell us. Finally we walked to the reception desk and were told where it was. It is down a dirt road that was under construction. Not a great place for kids to be playing. The pool is absolutely freezing, not heated at all. The beach is not nice at all, and not a great swimming beach at all. ( this we knew before arriving) As for positives, Im finding them really hard to find. The grounds are nice, but not amazing. We have vacationed at Little Dix Bay in Virgin Gorda, The Amanyara Turks and Caicos, Caneel Bay, and the Westin in St John. All are far better options. This resort is three star at best. Not once has a manager address any of the problems with the quests. Every single person we have spoke to at the hotel has said that they are having a miserable time. You can't swim because the pool is cold, meals take 2/3 hours to get right, construction is going on everywhere are disturbing the peace. I will never return to recommend this resort to anyone.

We did travel on points and free weekend awards. We stayed for 5 nights, were upgraded to an oceanfront suite (amazing). OK... More of the same here if you are reading all of these reviews. So, I am not going to expand upon many common points mentioned in previous reviews. Pro's: -Beautiful Property (well manicured and very spacious) -Nice Pool -Great Food (Fern for 1 dinner/breakfast & SeaGrapes a bunch) -Private -Room (Suite was amazing: HUGE bathrooms) -Location (direct flight, convenient location to other parts of Puerto Rico) -SPA (really nice, but expensive; I did massage and wife did facial, both awesome) -Complimentary Driving Range Privileges at Golf Course -Bikes/Boats and Bike Trails -Service (slow to meet special requests, but good overall) - Free Coffee Service in morning: Became a nice daily ritual for us; every morning waking up calling for coffee, sitting out on patio and shaking off the cobwebs with a cup of fresh joe overlooking the ocean Con's: -A/C: Yes, our Air Conditioner was quite loud. It blows down from above the bed (at least it does in the suite we were in). It sounds about as loud as a vacuum cleaner being on all night. See Tip #1 below. -Pricey: I agree with previous reviews; be prepared for high costs. $15 dollar drinks at pool and restaurants are expensive. Just part of the deal. See Tip #2 below -Limited Restaurant Options On-Site In contract to many other reviewers, we did not have any major service issues. In speaking with multiple butlers about this complaint, they are aware of the problem. They have had issues with phones and computers, which has been a bit of a problem. I think it is getting better. Overall, all employees of resort always had smile on their face and happy to help. Tip #1 (Air Conditioning): After the first night, we learned to turn the thermostat down to 65 for about 2-3 hours before bed; then turned it off and cranked the ceiling fan. It was very comfortable (quiet) sleeping. We bumped into some people that had no issues with AC, and others that did, so it must depend on the room. Tip #2 (Price): Eat out. There are some great restaurants around; many mentioned in previous reviews. The Kiosks in Luquillo (15-20 min drive) were nice. It is a row of restaurants and bars (attached to each other). Offer good, affordable food options. We had dinner at restaurant #2; liked it, but if we had it to do over again, would try one of the other places. We traveled off-site for dinner 2 of 5 nights; and wish we did it more. Pasta y Pueblo is a must do. #1 rated restaurant in Luquillo by Trip Advisor (not part of Kiosks: a traffic light or two past them). Picture a shack close to the beach, no matching chairs, silverware, etc. Some of the tables were standing up on 2 v 4's. Christmas lights running the top of the restaurant. Sits about 16-20 total people. BUT, the food is amazing, and SO inexpensive. We had coconut shrimp and the mahi mahi, both outstanding. Owner was super friendly, came out for a talk and asked us to sign his book. Cool experience, be prepared for something outside the norm. AND, a BYOB. Hard to find, so plug in their address to your phone navigation. Tip #3: Rent a Car: If you are staying more than 3 nights, you MUST rent a car. It made our trip so much more enjoyable. St Regis would prefer you take a taxi, so you are stuck and eat with them every night. Rio Grande is in a good location. 15 minutes from the Rainforest (we were going to go, but ran out of time; hear ziplines are awesome). 15 minutes from Luquillo (good food) and 30-40 minutes to Fajardo (Bio Luminescent Bay: also wanted to go, but it was a full moon when we were there, so passed on it). Tip #4: I-Phone: \"Maps\" Navigation: I have an iphone 4, the navigation through the Maps application worked great for our rental car. I would assume same for blackberry users. Tip #5: Directions to the resort from Airport: We got a little lost on our trip to the resort from the airport (and heard many others did as well). There is more than 1 turnoff for Rt 187 from Route 3. It is the 2ND light for Rt 187 (1st left after the Ralph's SuperMarket, which is on the right) Tip #6: Ralph's: One of the benefits of rental car is that we ran out to the local supermarket to get food. Picked up milk, mixers, wine, beer, snacks and breakfast food. It turned out to be an excellent move. We were happier to sit on our patio (oceanfront) and eat our own food in peace than going to Fern or SeaGrapes. Recommend you get checked in, get your bearings, and then make a run out to get your food. Improvements/Recommendations to St Regis: 1) Make Golf more affordable: I realize this is a \"5 Star\" property, but the cost was too high. I am a single digit handicap and play a lot of golf. $185 a round plus $65 rental clubs is too high. Yes, it is Robert Trent Jones course, and on the beach, and exclusive. But, they had 2 groups (total of 6 golfers) going out to play the ENTIRE day I went over to hit balls. It was an overcast day, but absolutely empty. Move it down to $150 including rental clubs; it will keeps the hacks away, and bring more good play to the course. 2) Valet Parking Cost: $22 a day for valet parking? The valet parking area could easily be offered as a service, but not mandatory. The lot where they take the cars is so close to the rooms. Would be more convenient to guests to just go get in their car, instead of calling and then waiting at the mainhouse, which we had to do every time. Isn't the $60/day resort cost enough? I just don't see the need for this expense. 3) Air Conditioning: It was not a huge deal, but I really would suspect that the engineer/architect that created the design is having to answer a few questions to hotel mgmt. It was startlingly loud. Again, like a constant running of a vacuum cleaner or a sound machine (for those of you with kids) running all night. The rooms are fabulous, that it particularly stood out that the AC was so noisy. Overall, we had a fantastic trip. For 5 nights, we ran up a bill of $1600 at check-out. I attached some pictures, hope they help. We hope to be back....

I'll preface this review with the fact that I paid for my 5 night stay with a combination of \"free nights\" and starpoints, so I feel like I ultimately got a great value. I'm spg platinum and was not upgraded at check in. I stayed in a superior room, 811 which was wonderful. Not an ocean view, but the room itself was large and with the property being brand new, everything in the room was in good condition. The bathroom was enormous. So big that we were able to comfortably fit my daughter's crib in the shower area where she slept each night without a problem. We had a nice patio where we ate breakfast each morning along with the coffee provided by the hotel. I'd made a run to Ralph's supermarket to pick up a bunch of snacks, fruit, milk etc which I was able to eat for breakfast. Saved me $35 pp which is the adult buffet price. I think they also had a kids buffet for $25. Some folks had referenced a problem with the AC being loud. We didn't have an issue. We also live in a pre-war apt with window AC units so we might be used to some noise. The other couple we were with didn't have a problem w/ the AC either. The property is huge. Pool area has a great layout and you don't feel like you're on top of anyone else. Never a problem to secure chairs.....guess thats the benefit of staying at a hotel w/ only 139 rooms. As mentioned the pool is not heated (guessing this helped them get their Audobon green rating). Hot tub nice, but not overly hot. The kids pool was great. One of those declining pools that starts inches deep then flows into the regular pool. Was nice for the little ones to splash around in a totally safe spot. Beach was great. Not the white sand and crystal blue water, but huge and our daughter was able to run all over the place. The last few days we were there they'd set up a kids section w/ tons of new toys they'd apparently bought at a local toys r us. I think the sea water was a touch warmer than the pool water so I preferred to hang out there. I took two tennis lessons w/ Carl the director of tennis. He was awesome. Great guy who's taught many college players and some on the atp tour. Really helped my game in just two lessons. There are only two tennis courts and no pro shop. Would be great to see them build this up. Didn't play golf, but the course looked great. It was cloudy for 2 of our 6 days there, but the property is very expansive w/ great running and biking trails along with a boathouse where you can use non-motorized boats for free. Bikes are also free to use. The only complaints I'd have about the hotel is the restaurant & maid/butler service. One day I had to call \"butler service\" 4 times for a bottle opener. You'd think they'd rush this over as not having a bottle opener precludes you from purchasing items in the mini-bar. I had to call my butler Ricardo on his personal cell before I got it. Also, room make up and turn down service was non-existant some days and I had to call for it. That was a bit frustrating. Regarding the restaurants, there are only a few options, Seagrapes (by the pool), Fern (jean georges) and Molasses (at the golf course). I think seagrapes/fern are always open, but Molasses only some days. Ask the receptionist at check in for details. Seagrapes - was good for lunch. food is not cheap, but i thought it was great. service was adequate for lunch. for dinner it was different story. we went there 1 night and our waitress didn't introduce herself for 10 minutes, then proceeded to mess up the majority of the entrees. we had 2 crying toddlers so we like to eat and run and the server didn't help. they did wind up comping our bill that night which was great. we just didn't return for dinner. Fern - nice dining room and i thought the food was good. ate here 3 times during my stay and the 3rd time was NOT THE CHARM. as mentioned we were with 2 toddlers. this is typically a nicer restaurant than we'd go to w/ our child, but as mentioned seagrapes took themselves out of the dining picture. we ordered the entrees and the girls got a bit restless at which point the manager came over to us and said \"we try to keep a certain ambience at this restaurant, so please try and keep your kids quiet\" this guy must be from a different planet to think you can simply tell a 15 month old to keep quiet and they act accordingly. this made a very uncomfortable situation for all of us and put a damper on the evening. Molasses (at the golf clubhouse)- this is the best spot to eat at, but i think its only open a few nights a week. our server, Braulio i think, was great. taught us a lot about the local cuisine, current events and sporting news and was so quick to react to anything we wanted while eating there. He was the most attentive employee we came into contact with our entire stay. Ultimately a great stay b/c the property is expansive and luxurious, quality of actual food was good and the room was perfect. I'm sure the service kinks (and some employees) will be optimized out. Hoping I can return in the future when the St Regis is firing on all cylinders. p.s. they have a s'mores cookout and champagne tasting on the weekend nights (both are free). we were not informed at check-in so we missed the s'mores event.", "Date": "December 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cAmazing facilities, service and food.

We stayed on points and starwood's free weekend award, since I'm a platinum member we were able to be upgraded to an oceanfront room, room 311. Overall the place was amazing and I highly recommend it especially if you're coming from the east coast as it's such a short flight. Pros: 1. Top notch facilities in everyway. The bathroom of our room might have been the nicest one I've ever stayed in at any hotel. Two different shower heads, tons of space, jacuzzi....amazing! The room also had a walk in closet and private patio with a view of the beach. 2. Everything is brand new and nice. The club house, lobby, restaurants, even the gym was in great shape. Can't say the same for other 5 stars with years of use, but take advantage of this while you can. 3. Food was amazing, especially at Fern, where we ate twice. Yes, everything here is overpriced as many have complained but guess what? You're staying at a 5 star resort. If you don't like it, book at holiday inn and shut up. I didn't like paying 5 bucks for a bottle of water but I did like the army of people there to serve me. Cons: 1. Because it's new, they have to work on a few kinks. The movie in our room never worked even though we were told we would get one for free per night, I called each night to let them know about this issue and it neve got fixed. They even charged me for the movie for each night but after calling in they quickly fixed it. Not a big deal, but there are definite service isssues they have to work on. 2. The beach really blows. As many have pointed out, this is not a true Carribbean beach which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. We stayed by the pool the whole time which was fine. Also I played the golf course which was super nice. I'm a 12 handicap and had no problem playing fromthe tees in front of the tips.

We are having room service because the only place open tonight is Fern, we ate there last night and it is just ok and not really a Jean George experience. Let me start with the drive. I called the hotel and was emailed directions that were perfect and it was an easy drive with no trouble finding the hotel. Check-in: It took about 30min because I reserved a ocean front king and while I appreciated the upgrade they gave us a larger room with a garden view. We wanted to be on the ocean and it took a half hour to figure out there were no ocean view rooms available. We were moved back to my original room for the rest of the stay. I recommend the ocean rooms over the garden even if the garden room is larger. The sound of the ocean with the sounds of nature are great. Rooms: the first suite had a very loud a/c unit and we discovered that you can have engineering set for VIP so that you can take it off the program mode and cool it down more. For those of us that live in hot humid climates like Houston, we are sensitive about a/c. The rooms have a humidity problem and it is not summer yet. The ocean room had a quieter a/c but still humid. The bathrooms are fantastic but we had an issue with hot water one night until we discovered that you need to turn on the handheld shower along with the rain shower for it to get hot. We loved the balcony looking and listening to the ocean. Food: I am not shocked by prices in resorts like this. You have to realize it will be that way. As stated we were not impressed with Fern, the breakfast there is pretty good with an amazing french toast dish. Molasses at the golf course was best with regional cuisine that we enjoyed and would have returned except it is closed on Mon and Tues. Service: I agree with almost all that has been said. The staff is very friendly, they just don't seem to have been trained very well. We were told to go to Loquilla Beach for snorkeling and we could pick up the gear at the boathouse on drive out. There was no one at the boathouse for about 15min and then a mgr and an employee arrived and we were told they do not have snorkeling equip and after several phone calls they could not find any. We also found the directions from concierge to be incorrect but it was easy to find. The snorkeling there was non-existant and I do not recommend going there to eat either. When we left and returned to the property and went to the beach the attendant told us the stuff was at the beach shack there. He brought us new sets as well as boogey boards. Some staff were not sure when different restaurants were open or closed including concierge. Calling is a problem and you find no answer many times. One morning our pre-ordered coffee arrived on time, the next day it did not arrive without a phone call 30min after it should have been there. If you look at the Ritz San Juan reviews you see some of the same service problems. It may be a culture problem here.

Not necessary, but very, very cool. Complimentary coffee delivery in the morning. We had brought our own cereal and yogurt and the hotel delivered coffee and milk and we had breakfast on our patio for free. The pool is outstanding. Super comfortable lounge chairs, great service, lots of places to sit and it did not feel crowded. We saw the pool manager the last day and asked her to consider making the pool a no cell phone area as there were at least 3 people on long business calls sitting at the pool. The beach is clean, large and not crowded. We could walk both directions for quite a ways and really enjoyed the beach. The property has a walking path and nature path that are well marked, easy to follow, long enough to feel like a workout (3 miles) and you see some terrific greenery. The golf course looked very nice. Food and drinks were terrific. We ate at the pool, at the casual restaurant and at the upscale restaurant.

Our key did not work one night and we called the front desk and asked them to send someone. We asked that the person come right away - and as we hung up the phone saw a person running (yes running) towards our room to open the door. Cons Yes, the drive is confusing to get to the hotel.

They will say yes to whatever you ask and then none of it comes to fruition! And this I might add, goes all the way up to the GM. The reception/check-in process was probably the best and only thing that went right. We had a suite that was lovely and our butler did come and make us a mojito upon check in but then never to be seen again.

The wine at the bar was undrinkable...every red by the glass had been opened for days. The piece de resistance though was my camera getting stolen.

A lot of time and attention was spent on it, and you can tell. The grounds are beautifully planned and planted. The golf course and club house are stunning, reminiscent of The Breakers. The beach is wide and very long; the nearest hotel from the resort beach is around a point and very far away. There are little hide away places for two all along the beach. The water is not the clear, snorkel-off-the-beach kind, but rather has waves, which we kind of liked as the sound was nice. The pool is large and beautiful and kid-friendly, with a \"beach-bottom\" area, one-foot deep baby pools, and 3 foot shallow pools, as well as 5 foot areas for grown ups. The pool is smartly made to feel like many smaller pools, so even when you are on a lounge chair you don't feel like you are on top of anyone else and it is easy to sit away from the kids at the resort if you so desire. The pool is cold though. The main building is well done and check-in was wonderful, reminescent of a One-and-Only. The rooms are gorgeous, the bathrooms are impressive and luxurious, and we didn't have a problem with air conditioner noise like others seemed to. The spa is breathtaking, with ample outdoor showers and pools, and the treatment areas are open to the outside but carefully planned to be completely private. The downside: service. At check-in you are led to believe that you are in a very exclusive resort and every whim will be catered to. Do not be decieved. Each room has butler service, but he takes his sweet time getting to your request, if it happens at all. Housekeeping quality is inconsistant. The consierge is happy to help you if she is there and not busy, but she does not return phone messages, acknowledge you if she is busy, or get back to you about things she had to check on because she just didn't know the answer when you asked. We even got incorrect directions to the rain forest (and yes, they were printed out!). Restaurants are only open sometimes, and on some days there is only one option, and there is nothing else near the resort. Seagrapes was an adventure; the food was inconsistent and the service was terrible: long waits for food, forget items, forget drinks, etc. To get around the property, there are staff with golf carts, but if you want one you usually have to wait. The staff is uninformed about what else is going on on the property; we took a ride to the boathouse only to find it closed an hour before, we were told the kids club was open when it was not, we were told there were kids bikes and there are not. They started a construction repair while we were there, sending horrible noises throughout the pool area and closing the bathroom completely, but there was no notification that this would be happening (had we known we would have gone to the rainforest that day instead!). Speaking of noise, the groundskeeping staff has no problem running the leaf blower just a few feet from you while you are relaxing at the pool, or while you are trying to enjoy breakfast on the balcony of the restaurant. Breakfast was our favorite meal but make sure you request milk at the same time as your coffee or else your cup will be cold by the time your milk arrives. Resort-wide, if you have a special or unusual request, forget it. You will be told OK, certainly, but then it just won't ever happen, and nobody will get back to you to tell you that. In fact follow-up in general does not exist. Even the hotel manager was supposed to contact us and never did. The one exception was poolside. We had better service there than any other place besides check-in. Also your food will come faster if you stay in your pool chair rather than get up and sit at the restaurant. It is the same menu. Some improvements I would recommend, besides the obvious of overhauling the service, is having more to do in the early evening, especailly since the resort is so isolated. Would love to have a drink on the Seagrapes patio before dinner. Would love to see the telescopes come out after sundown to stargaze from the beach. Would really love a big sandy bonfire. This resort has potential and if they can just get the service level up, then it would be amazing. I hope that can happen, because it truly is a beautiful place, and I'd like to be able to recommend it without hesitation in the future. But for now, if you want a fabulous setting and are willing to make your own vacation happen, rather than being taken care of, then this resort is perfect. Bring your own food, anticipate your every need, and rent a car. The facilities are great!

The members of staff are overwhelmingly pleasant and the check-in process and arrival at the room are essentially seamless. Our room was in the area called Santuario and it was just that. The luxury was understated but the superlative quality of the appointments was evident. But there are several negatives, which will hopefully be ironed out as time passes on. The service in general can be a bit unpredictable. A place the likes of St. Regis must be spot on if it expects to maintain its clientele. Although the exact tea service was repeatedly ordered, it varied on each occasion. Seagrapes is revamping its service at the time if writing this review, but of note is that items were described on the menu but arrived completely different from advertised. Service on the beach is simply quite bad because of long wait times and servers (?) who take little effort to figure out for whom an order is meant. Fern serves very good food. The experience there was only OK because of a very sour hostess who seemed inconvenienced by the fact that we had no reservations-- the restaurant was near empty-- and by servers who constantly fawned over what seemed to be a St. Regis 'frequent flyer table',to the exclusion of lesser-known guests as we clearly were. The beach has great potential. It is a vast expanse of unobstructed openness. Unfortunately it could stand to be maintained a bit as far as removal of washed up debris, often including broken glass and rotting flora. The water energizes with its rapidly breaking waves and slopes gently for maximum enjoyment. Kudos to The St. Regis staff who are almost all extremely pleasant. Of note are a $60 resort fee, a $22 valet parking charge and uncertainty as to whether or not Internet service is complimentary. If the management closely examines the entire guest experience and picks apart those pesky areas and sincerely tries to improve them, this hotel could rise to the stature of a St. Regis property.", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston TX", "Title": "\u201cElegant facility, incredible staff and food, and very expensive - exclusive experience\u201d", "Author": "BMWM5Driver", "ReviewID": "UR89189731", "Content": "The facility will transform your stay into a tropical paradise - think Tommy Bahamma decor all the way. Just an incredible facility with staff eager to make you happy. This is a must Vacation experiernce for Families or Traveling with a spouse. The nightly hotel rates are high, but the Hotel / Pool / Beach / Boat House (Kayak, Bicycles, Sailing...) / Nature trails are rewarding. I have issues with the $60 a day resort fee - it includes internet access for all your devices, bottled water in your room, excellent care by the staff, towles by the pool but does not include Valet parking (add $22/day). In room dinning prices are the same as the restaurant dinning prices - very high. Food quality is excellent, but you'll drop $200 a day in food plus alcohol for two persons. The value dining options are not good outside the resort area either - local food was not very tasty, there is a burger king, mcDonalds and Wendy'd nearby. So be ready to pay the resort dining price. Concierge was helpfull with the Bio Bay Luminecent, Jungle Tour, Old San Juan City tour. Sitting by the Hotel beach, by the pool and by the bar was very nice!! Dont forget about the Casino;s in DownTown San Juan - I do recommend renting your own car if you plan to stay longer than 3 nights. You are going to want to step out of the resort to find cheeper drinks and food. Lastly, the room ws superb - shower, furniture, lighting, bath.... Just beautiful rooms! I had a hard time each night sleeping on their matress sets. There ws a wedding at the resport during our visit.

This met my expectations on service, but unfortunately they didn't keep it up for the balance of the stay. When you pay a $60 per day resort fee, on top of whatever rate (we were there on points, and it seemed everyone we talked to also was, so maybe that is part of the issue - that no one is actually paying to stay here yet). More on the positives first - the pool was very nice, hardly anyone was there, they have a nice \"beach entrance\" to the pool for the kids to play in. The beach is beautiful and you can walk very far. The rooms are great - we had a small upgrade, just one level, and it gave us a little extra space by the closet and bar/fridge area, which was perfect for our crib. The bathrooms are huge - huge rain shower with separate hand shower, and extra large tub. We slept great in the beds (with ear-plugs, the air conditioning is a disaster as was mentioned in previous reviews). You need a car, but you have to pay $22/day for parking (which we were surprised by, as we never saw this on the website and thought it was part of the $60/day). The food at Fern is amazing, and worth every penny. The negatives: 1. The pool is difficult for a stroller. No ramps to get around, and several areas with stairs, and no other way around. Could be difficult for disabled people. Also the pool is not heated and is colder than the ocean. Suggestion to hotel, you could heat one section of the pool since they are all separated, this would allow one warmer area, without heating the whole thing. 2. Not sure what you get for the $60/day other than internet access. The \"frozen grapes and fruit kebabs\" consisted of, once per hour starting at noon (but never at a consistent time, i.e. not on the hour or 1/2 hour), someone would bring a small tray of the \"amenity\" that was either a small iced tea, a small frozen grapes (about 5 grapes), or a small fruit smoothie (about the size of a shot). We never saw a fruit kebab. They were very good, but if you missed it because you were in the bathroom or something, you missed out, often we had to ask for the amenities because they didn't show up, we never got one every hour. We got a cold towel once, on one day (and we were there a week and at the pool for 5 days solid). They only offer tap water, you have to pay for bottled water. Hint, you can get all the bottled water you want from the workout room - which is also very nice - and fresh fruit, so we just went there often and grabbed some. But if they are giving it out for free (you can also get from the butler free), why not offer it free at the pool too, and in the restaurants? If you want at the pool you either bring your own, or have to pay $6 for the Fiji water. I think they should offer this with easier access for everyone - it is just their own private label bottled water. They could leave out bottled water and fresh fruit at the pool and it would be a really nice touch and great for the kids. The boat house is nice, the bikes have no gears so aren't great (these are also included in the $60/day fee) 3. Their tap water is drinkable but heavily chlorinated. You can really taste the chlorine. It wouldn't take much for them to filter this, at least in the restaurants. It would be a nice touch and something I would expect at any upscale resort but for sure a St. Regis. It is annoying that they seem to want you to pay for the Fiji water instead of offering a decent tap water, or their private label bottled water as an option in the restaurants. 4. The food and drink prices are insane. The wine at Fern is marked up easily 3-5 times retail. For example, the Caymus Special Select, which retails for around $90-$100, sells for $600! The Caymus regular, we pay $75 for, they were selling for $229 - at any high end restaurant in the US the most we have seen it for is $150. Hint - You can get Carry Out from Fern, buy wine at the grocery store, and have a great meal in your room on your patio, with good wine for retail and avoid the room service charges (the Fern food isn't on the room service menu either). You have to ask the butler for plates and silverware, they didn't provide with the carryout. The prices at all the restaurants are equally insane, so just eat at Fern if you have to eat at the hotel. 5. The kids club isn't finished yet. When I inquired about it before we arrived, they didn't tell me, and were hesitant to tell me when we got there. They still offered that their guy could play with the kids for a fee and would do games or things, but I mostly just wanted to use the facility with my kids - which the in room book says is something you can do (kids are welcome to use with a parent free of charge), but there was no facility. I have no idea when it will open, so if you want this, you should ask specifically if the facility is open. 6. They had some children's amenities which were great, small bath robe, small slippers (great for our 5 year old), a diaper genie for the baby - but others they mentioned in the book in the room, they didn't have (a baby bathtub, baby shampoo). Hint, instead of a bath, we used the hand shower and put the baby on the shower floor, it took two of us, but worked great, and better than the sink. There is no way you could use the regular tub, and warning, the water in the regular tub is very hot - we put on all cold, and just a 1/4 turn of hot, and it was still too hot. They really should provide outlet covers too - the crib was right by two outlets (and it was a strange place to have outlets), so we had to keep it away from the wall. 7. They are supposed to be very environmentally conscious, but the only recycle bins we saw are in the room (which is great). They might have them in the pool area, but they aren't marked at all, so we had no idea where to put our water bottles. I think that is enough for now - I just expect a St. Regis to wow me with service, and I wasn't wowed, except at check-in. They should think about those extra touches they could do throughout your stay that would really make a difference and wouldn't cost much. An evening cocktail reception or happy hour (to relieve you from the $15/per cocktail prices), bottled water and fruit at the pool, one restaurant with a little more reasonable pricing, and other things I am sure they can think of. My other tips to you: You must have a car. Hit a grocery store (Ralph's is really close by), and buy milk and cereal for breakfast, have coffee delivered (this is free too), and enjoy breakfast on your patio. Buy Lunchables for the kids at the pool, and all the snacks, beer, liquor etc. Pack a small cooler to bring these to the pool. Eat dinner offsite (FYI - Fern is closed for dinner on Sunday, and the only place open is Seagrapes, which is average and overpriced, so you should plan to eat offsite on a Sunday). Offsite places - the Kiosks are great (head Left on Route 3, up a few miles, you will see a sign on the right for the exit for the Kiosks, #2, and #12 (I think) were great. Pasta Y Pueblo is great too (closed Monday-Tuesday), search Loquillo restaurants for reviews here and location.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful property, still working out the kinks\u201d", "Author": "NYC_traveler_ES", "ReviewID": "UR88364875", "Content": "My fiance and I stayed the week of Thanksgiving to get away and relax. What we liked: - The rooms were very well appointed and lovely - Fern restaurant was fantastic, food and service were excellent - The pool was beautiful, and there were plenty of chairs both on by the pool and by the beach. Service in the pool area was great - Overall the grounds are very beautiful and plush What wasn't so great: - The resort is fairly isolated (which is great if you want to stay on property the whole time) but less great if you want to eat off property, pick up snacks, etc. There are nice restaurants in the other resorts, but expect at least 30 minutes drive each way. - The concierge service was mixed, depending on who was working. We asked the concierge to book a biolumenescent bay tour for us. It was never confirmed, and when we finally called back the next day, a different person told us the tour had been cancelled. Noone had bothered to tell us that, and by the time we were informed it was too late to make other plans. - The concierge printed the price list for golf for us, and we made our tee time accordingly. When we went to the golf course, they informed us that the price quoted was not correct (raised from $115 to $185, which was an unexpected 60% increase per person). As amateur golfers, we felt this was a bit much and went back to our room; Eventually, the front desk told us that they would honor the price and we trekked back to the course. The course is lovely (and very difficult) but we were a bit frustrated at the pricing mishap. - SeaGrapes restaurant (by the pool) hasn't quite worked out the food and service kinks yet. The second time we ate there, we ordered nachos, a burger and chicken fingers. We waited for 30 minutes without any waiter service (I had to refill our water glasses myself). When the food finally arrived, they brought the appetizer with the food and the chicken fingers were raw inside. The manager was very apologetic and comped the meal, but the service was not up to my expectations for the St. Regis and the prices of the food. Perhaps when the hotel has been up and running a while and things are smoother, I would recommend. While the property is beautiful, I think its still a bit early and not quite up to my expectations for a Starwood Category 6.

From start to finish the entire experience was exceptional. First of all, the property itself is gorgeous. They have over 400 acres of lush green landscape nestled between the El Yunque Rainforest and the Atlantic Ocean. The pretty plantation style villas are spread out amongst beautiful landscaping with wooden boardwalks connecting the buildings so as not to disturb the native plant life. The beach is over two miles long, very wide, and is extremely well maintained with chairs and shaded Bali beds for guest use. The tiered free-form pool is like a series of secret lagoons and is one of the nicest I have seen. There are lounge chairs, couches, and cabanas all around with more than enough space for everyone to have a private nook. And finally, the rooms... They were breath taking. They are all brand new and very well decorated. They are very large and all have balconies with couches and tables for private dining. We were in an Ocean View Suite and loved leaving the sliding doors open so that we could fall asleep to the nice ocean breeze and the crashing of the waves. Fern by Jean-Georges was also delicious. I highly recommend the tasting menu for a bite of all the best that the menu has to offer. Most importantly - the service was IMPECCABLE. My boyfriend and I have both worked in luxury travel and hospitality for many years and know the meaning of excellent service. We were extremely impressed by all of the staff at the St Regis Bahia Beach. Everyone we encountered was so attentive and helpful. They even sent some very thoughtful amenities to our room for our anniversary, including Champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a sweet card from Elizabeth and Ivan. There are a few people in particular who I would like to recognize who went above and beyond to provide outstanding customer service - Ivan (Butler Service), Elizabeth (Butler Service), Issac (Butler Service), Elvis (Library Bar), Janira (Library Bar), Jailine (Front Desk), Linda (Front Desk), Luis (Concierge) and Angelica (Seagrapes Server). Not only did they provide great service, but they understand the importance of adding the warm personalized touch that makes people feel welcome. All in all I would absolutely recommend St Regis Bahia Beach to anyone traveling to Puerto Rico. It is definitely one of the best and most beautiful properties on the island. For an experience that provides the best of both worlds I would highly recommend a few days at Bahia Beach combined with a few days at W Retreat & Spa Vieques, which is another wonderful new Starwood property that will show you another beautiful, untouched side of Puerto Rico. Of course, a night in San Juan is also a must for the beautiful architecture, history, and nightlife. Bottom line, you have to come to Puerto Rico and you have to stay at Bahia Beach.
