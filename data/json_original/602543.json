{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very disappointing and over priced This hotel was very difficult for our taxi driver to find. He eventually had to call the hotel to get directions. They did not have a sign in English, and so we had a difficult time even finding the entrance. We paid 600 RMB a night and we expected so much more from a hotel that claims to be 4 stars. The floor boards were loose and coming up off of the floor. The bed was hard, the pillows were flat, and we saw hair in the bed when we pulled back the sheets. There were no English channels other than the standard CCTV-9. In the bathroom they have installed sauna tubs, but they have not even gone through the effort to pull the plastic off of the tubs. The jets had something growing in them, and there was a huge gap between the tub and the floor which was filled with dirt and who knows what else. The tub is so big that in order to sit on the toilet, you have to sit facing sideways because the bathtub is in the way. I have stayed in some nice hotels in China that only cost 450 RMB, and I expected so much more from this hotel. Overall it was dirty and disappointing.", "Date": "Oct 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR718010884", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "leslielynn"}, {"Content": "Nice place to stay Rooms are clean and very nice with modern features. Price is right. On the down side it's hard to find someone that speaks English and worst of all not one TV channel in English. One would think a hotel that caters to westerners would at least have CNN or BBC.", "Date": "Dec 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR889063256", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Tomneptune"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d602543-r20868868-Millennium_Palace-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "602543", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
