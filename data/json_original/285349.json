The biggest positive is that you simply could not ask for a better location. It's about a 5 minute walk to both San Marco Square and the Rialto Bridge. The room itself was a tad small, but very attractive in terms of decor. The bathroom, however, was a bit too small. Because of the bidet placement, the door wouldn't open all the way and you literally had to squeeze between the door and the shower to get to the toilet. It wasn't a huge issue, but wasn't exactly ideal either. Our only other issue was that the room key had to be left at the front desk whenever you left and then you had to be buzzed back into the hotel. Generally this wasn't an issue, but there were at least two occasions where we had to wait outside about 10 minutes before someone let us back in. We prefer to have a bit more freedom in our ability to come and go. Apart from that, we did enjoy our stay.

We had a great time in Venice, part of which is this hotel. The hotel is, like all the buildings in Venice, is a historic, charming building but very modern and convenient inside. Our room was right behind the reception desk, facing the canal. The room was fairly sized, with all the amenities you would need. The bathrooms didn't have a bathtub (no big deal for us), but had a shower. The breakfast had ample choice, although after 5 days of stay, became a bit routine. The coffee was excellent (although the coffee flasks weren't ideal). The hotel staff always had a smile on their face, and were warm and friendly. The excellent part of this hotel is the location. There is nothing like spending later evenings and night in St.Marks square after all the tourist crowd's have vanished. We spent almost every night very late in St.Marks square, and would get back to hotel early morning 1-2 AM. The total walk is less than 2 minutes. Being a photographer, I would go before sunrise (and before the crowds) to get decent pictures of St.Marks square.Never did I felt unsafe walking with all that photogear late at night, partly I knew, I was not far away from my hotel. I have posted a link to pictures of my trip below. Its a 10 minute walk to Accamedia bridge, and 15 minute to Rialto bridge. Overall, this hotel complements your trip to Venice. This hotel is not a fancy 4 or 5 start hotel with amazing facilities, but a quiet, good, great value hotel, with EXCELLENT location to St.Marks square. We were very happy with this hotel, and was our \"home\" after long days walking around. Being a lover of afternoon siesta's, we would decide to go back and have a restful naps, to be ready for evening trips. One cannot beat the location of this one. When we go back next time to Venice, we know where we will stay again.

It was an excellent, very pleasant stay. The furnishings are straightforward, functional and first class -- not overdone. Room very well lit. Bathroom fixtures excellent -- shower only, no tub. Breakfast buffet was ample, including sliced meats and cheeses, yogurt. Hotel staff helpful with concert ticket arrangements, weather information, directions, and other assistance. Small hotel, about 20 rooms with staff of about 10 people. Location convenient to shops and sights. Comfortable chairs in lobby on 1st floor, good place for reading. Security good. I recommend Ca' del Campo without hesitation. Directions -- an amendment to information obtained from other TripAdvisor reviews: The directions from Piazza San Marco, referring to a McDonald's restaurant, are no longer valid as there is no longer a McDonald's at the Piazza (thank goodness!). Instead, the following from Google, worked well for me: From the Piazza, go under the clock (to left of the American Bar), on Manzaria de l'Orologio, about 100m, until you are about 10m before the red Ferrari store at the T-junction. Turn right onto Ramo San Zulian, and go 50m to the next T-junction. Turn left onto Calle Specchieri, go 10m, take the next right and you are on Campo de La Guerra. The hotel is on your right, about 30m along, before you reach the bridge. Press buzzer for the hotel and they will let you in. There are a few steps to go up, to get to the elevator, where you can lift your bags. The lobby is on the first floor, above the entrance and elevator. Also, directions from airport: Exit airport, follow sidewalk to the left, about 7 minutes towards the water landing -- symbol of wavy lines with a boat drawing, on the signs. The landing has water taxis, and also the Alilaguna boat line. The blue line boat is the one we were advised to take, although I think the orange line boat would also have gotten us to our stop. The best stop is San Marco, because from it there are no bridge steps to go up/down to reach the Piazza and the hotel. If you buy ticket for Alilaguna at the airport, it costs 15 Euro at the dispenser in the baggage claim. Or you can buy ticket on the boat, for 16 Euro. Other updated info: Internet now costs 3 Euro/half hour, not 5 Euro. There is a computer in the lobby, do not need your own computer to check email etc. Cheers, e buon viaggio!", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, nice small hotel\u201d", "Author": "Glencor", "ReviewID": "UR119485561", "Content": "The location of this hotel is definitely the highlight. 2 minutes walk to St Marks Square and restaurants on your doorstep.

There was a vast choice for this B&B hotel, and the quality was just fine!! There was a good selection of ham and salami. There was brie and emmential (spelt wrong I'm sure!).

I had emailed the hotel directly to give them heads up as I really wanted this stay to be a special one. Out of the two weeks we were in Europe, I had planned Venice as the place to celebrate our offical 'one year'. They had emailed me and said i was booked in a superior canal facing room, like they were doing my a favour, but that is exactly what i was paying for! Location - As many have pointed out, it is abit of a nightmare trying to find this hotel as you have to go down a few of side narrow streets to get there. It is not far from all the action St Marc Square and all the shops and restaurants. Rooms - After we checked in, we went to our 'superior canal facing' room, which was on a lower floor, we thought the decorating of the rooms was unique compared to the other hotels we stayed at, with the 18th century style decorating. The canal view they gave was was very poor, if you looked down you could see the canal but I would not go so far to say it was romantic in any way shape or form. Another building was overlooking ours, with ratty clothes hanging down the side, so keeping the blinds open was not an option. The hotel's \"ground rules\" listed on the elevator seemed abit demanding, no outside food or drinks in the hotel room other than eating from their mini bar? No ironing in the rooms? The air conditioning was fairly loud which i found abit annoying. There also was a small 17\" LCD computer monitor that was also our television, one english channel, but very hard to watch. Staff and Service - We found the staff pleasant enough but I would not go as far to say they were extremely friendly or helpful at all, seemed more concerned about watching the security cameras or reading the paper. They knew we were there for our one year anniversary, and they had made no effort what so ever to even say \"congratulations\" We woke up abit late for breakfast one morning, so we arrived at 10:15, and breakfast ended at 10am. the food was still out and a couple of people were still eating, so we just grabbed a plate and started to eat - well, the recpetionist came up to us and not even politely she scolded us for being late - we were ok with that as we knew we were. A few minutes later the cleaning staff for the eating area seemed visibly upset with us and she said something to another worker - we were then scolded on a second time. I thought this was abit overboard, we are not children, we got the point, and to scold paying clients the way they did was not right either. In the service industry you have to be nice about things like this, that is my opinion. And speaking of the food, breakfast wasn't anything special, a small selection of food, the only real good thing about it was the coffee. One last thing about the service, we had asked for a late checkout for 2pm, as our flight was not leaving until 5, they told us they were very busy and had to get the room ready. Which we understood. no problem. we left our luggage in the lobby and walked around. We came back to the hotel at 2:30 and i sat down to rest.

There were two bedrooms, each with two twin beds, very high ceilings with chandaliers, windows opening to the courtyard in front of the hotel and the small canal on the side of the hotel. The first night I made the mistake of leaving the windows open and found that the boat traffic (deliveries and trash boats) start very early and don't mind making some noise. One morning I just stuck my head out the window and watched the boat traffic for about an hour (I guess I am easily amused). It is amazing how they maneuver the boats, some of which are fairly large, in the narrow canals, with lots of boat traffic, mixed in with a good number of gondolas. We took a gondola ride from right next to the hotel through the smaller canals, we paid $80 Euro for a trip of about 35 minutes. That is the economy tour and they tried to get us to go for the $100 Euro option. I would do it again even though it was expensive.

That site also has a virtual interactive walking tour in which I walked from San Marcos to the hotel and it made it easy to find when I actually arrived.

Here are the easiest directions to the hotel: Get off the Vaporetto near San Marcos Basilica, walk through the Piazza San Marcos (facing the front of the Basilica) and go to the left of the Basilica. Pass a small raised fountain area guarded by two stone lions and you will see the Hotel Concordia on your left. There is a small road or alley that actually splits through the Hotel Concordia, take that straight for about 100 yards, it is extremely narrow, single file in each direction, pass the hotel Monte Carlo, when you get to San Zulian church on your left, turn right onto Campo De La Guerra and the hotel is on your right just before you get to the canal.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and service in a clean beautiful hotel.\u201d", "Author": "mijoOntario", "ReviewID": "UR60760923", "Content": "Hotel Ca' del Campo took excellent care of us.

We chose all of our hotels based on reviews that we read on this website, so it is our duty to come online and at least write a short review. Tripadvisor was a Godsend, and we swear by it now. What a quirky city! We had never been to Venice before, and were absolutely blown away by the concept of a city on water. Nothing we read beforehand could have prepared us for Venice. However, this is a hotel review, so I shall stick to just that. \u00ef\ufffd\u0160 We came via train from Rome, so we arrived at the train station. Be prepared to travel around Venice either by boat or foot. We took the water bus to the nearest station as per the hotel website and the tourist person at the train station. However, be prepared for at least a fifteen minute walk from the water bus stop to the hotel. On top of that, be prepared to lug your luggage through narrow streets (and of course, up and down step bridges every fifty metres or so!). The taxis that would have dropped us at the hotel were extremely expensive, and after all, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a boat taxi, so a fair amount of lugging still needs to be done. Please note that you will encounter this transportation problem regardless of which hotel you choose, due to the nature of the city. (You will understand once you get there.)

Expect to be able to walk to any of the landmarks in Venice: two minutes to St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square and twenty five minutes to the church where they filmed Indiana Jones in the 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Our room was massive in terms of square footage. However, one could see that the furnishings were dated. Clean, but old. The bathroom was quite new though, and the toiletries were acceptable.

He came with us to the room - searched with us for it every where. Came back to the desk to see if any lost & found item was filled in. Nothing. He told me to leave a complanit with him, and that he will check with his collegue who was there earlier about it. Next morning, I went back to the hotel and found no news about finding the phone in the room. There was a temp staff at the reception - after I cried and requested to her to find my phone from the maids or the other receptionist ( the person who was there when we checked out), she took my number and promised to do so. She did call me and told me that they found my iPhone, and that her collegue found it, but forgot!! to file in the lost & found. She said her collegue who found it would mail it to me, if I give them my credit card details. I sent it via email, and it was mailed to me - 60 Euros for fed-Ex. When the phone arrived, I was shocked to find that it was tampered, and that the person at the reception (don't want to give the name), has played with it, to make it his own!!! and that was the reason he did not file it in lost & found! I was lucky to get my phone back at least I guess. But would not go back to this hotel, and would never recommend it for any one!!", "Date": "August 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Byron Bay, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Boutique hotel, 3 minute walk to San Marco Square\u201d", "Author": "RobertKaren", "ReviewID": "UR18549464", "Content": "Booked 2 rooms for my partner and 3 adult kids in July after reading good reviews on TA.

We caught the Alilaguna vaporetto for 12 Euros pp from the airport which is a wonderful way to start any visit to Venice. A water taxi would cost you about 7 times more. I recommend you do some research of where the hotel is situated before you go as it makes walking through the streets of Venice with a suitcase a little easier. It is possible to reach the hotel from St. Marks Square vaporetto stops without having to go over any bridges. The hotel is comfortable and security is good as there is someone on reception 24 hours and the only way in is via an intercom entrance. We paid 1000Euros for a 4 night stay in a 'superior' double room including breakfast which was more than adequate. Our room overlooked the small canal at the side of the hotel and although not an attractive view it was nice to see and hear the boats and gondolas going past. There were one or two noisy early mornings whilst the Venetians went about their work delivering goods or collecting rubbish but it added to the atmosphere. The hotel is in an excellent position for walking around Venice and for getting to the Basilica and Doges Palace early. There are many good restaurants nearby and I would recommend you walk away from St. Marks Square for good value. A personal favourite was Restaurant Al Peoceto Risorto in the Rialto and by the mercato del pesce (fish market). When visiting the Basilica take the stairway to the right just as you go in the entrance. It costs 3 Euros to go in but well worth it as it includes going on to the balcony with a view over St. Marks Square and gives you a better view of the mosaics on the ceiling.

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a nice stay in a quiet hotel.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "kjwills32", "ReviewID": "UR5504666", "Content": "Lovely hotel, easy to find, and once there ideal for exploring venice.

The room in the hotel was quite small, tiny bathroom, but very clean and nicely decorated, the breakfast was a continental style, nice breakfast room. The location is fantastic, small canal just yards away from the hotel, which we could see from our room, few mins to St Marks and few mins to Rialto bridge.

Based on a Tripadvisor review and desiring the top floor, we stayed in the red and green rooms. Same price ($290US) but quite different: Although the green room was spacious, except for a miniscule shower enclosure, the red room was at least twice the size with a large bath. The green room was adjacent and above a quiet courtyard, whereas the red was along the \"street\"(actually a walkway) frontage, but still quiet enough. I'd recommend the red room, unless you can get a deal on the smaller, but adequate green room. It was still early in the year and not too hot so we didn't use the airconditioning, but opened the nice Velux skylight windows: mistake as many mosquitos came in overnight. The second night we kept the windows closed and had no problems. We were later advised that we should have asked for some sort of mosquito repelling devices that they apparently offer. We were informed that screens don't exist in Venice? What a great location: 100 yards to San Marco, and 200 to the Rialto Bridge! We took the Alilaguna boat from the airport for 12 Euro's each, then schlepped our bags 300 or so flat yards to the hotel. Took a water taxi for 65 Euros total arranged by the hotel from within 30 feet of the hotel to the port for our cruise departure: Neat ride through the canals! A water taxi from the airport would have been worth it at even 100 Euros for the four of us to avoid looking for the hotel on foot with bags in toe.
