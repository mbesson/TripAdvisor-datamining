{"Reviews": [{"Content": "good value we stayed in nihombashi for our first japan visit as a couple. the location of this hotel is quite good, with a lot of restaurants and establishments nearby. the upscale mitsukoshi depato is just a few blocks away and where the train stations are. you can also walk up to tokyo station if you can (around 8-10 blocks away) where you can board the shinkansen. my only gripe about the location is that you can get lost the first few times because this is not on a major street, rather its on a small alley and could be hard to locate at night (especially after a few beers hehe).the room is small but very nice and clean. compared to the 3-star hotel we stayed in singapore, this is way better. the room is adequately-equipped and has a japanese-style bath tub and an automatic bidet/toiletthey serve breakfast which is just coffee/tea, toast, egg and cabbage salad and its the same everyday. but you can always eat outside as there's a starbucks and denny's nearbythe desk officers/receptionists are very nice and can speak english well, but you may need to get used with the accents. they are quite pleasant looking as well and always give you a smile and bow eveytime you pass by.japan hotels are quite strict with the time so plan your checkin/checkout well. they do provide late checkin (up to 5pm i think) for late checkouts they charge for every hour and you will get charged even if you were just 15mins over so keep that in mind.if you are on a budget, the HVF chain is a very reasonable hotel. but on our next trip we might try their more upscale locations like in shiodome or ropponggi.", "Date": "Nov 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR803436613", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "napalmdog"}, {"Content": "2nd stay is still good!

He always stays in this hotel chain whenever he goes Tokyo for business trip. We chose Nihombashi because the rates are comparatively lower than the Shinjuku or Ueno hotel of the hotel chain.We read the reviews before we went to Tokyo and yet we still have a little difficulty finding the hotel when we first arrived. That's because we got out from a different exit and thus end up making rounds and rounds. Lucky for us, we arrive in the morning and thus able to see the signs from near the Mitsukoshi Shopping Center. After that we have no difficulty getting back to the hotel. In fact it's really just a straight road through before making a turn.Train station is around 10mins walk if you are not a fast walker. Accessibility is convenient as the Mitsukoshi station runs 2 lines. The skyliner from Narita airport stops at Ueno station which is just 3-4 stations away from Mitsukoshi station.The hotel is in a business district so may be a little quiet when you go back to the hotel late in the evening. On a working day, you most likely will be walking opposite directions as the office workers. The rooms are small but relatively bigger than some of the other hotels. At least you still have space to get your luggage open up flat on the floor. All the necessities are in and the rooms are quite new.We had breakfast included in our room package and the breakfast is served at the lobby in front of the reception. Variety of bread, salad, boiled eggs and coffee and tea are served. Good enough if you are not into some fancy breakfast, although you get a little sick of the same food for a whole week.There are many shops around the hotel area. 7-11 is just at the end of the street and there is a Pororoca supermart nearby which sells even raw food and vegetables. Many shops selling of sushi, ramen, bento etc. in the streets nearby too. The big shopping center, Mitsukoshi is just above the train station. However, it closes early at 7.30pm.Overall, I had an enjoyable stay at this hotel. I will definitely stay in this hotel again. May even try other hotels under the same hotel chain.", "Date": "Oct 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR777966758", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Aboohan"}, {"Content": "Clean, small rooms We had this hotel booked through a Japanese website called Rakuten, and got a very good deal. This is one of the business hotels scattered in Japan, which are low-budget friendly but with good enough facilities and amenities.The front desk/reception is located on the basement floor, and the rooms upstairs. In front of the front desk are tables and chairs used for breakfast.Our room was very small, with a TV and compact shower room. Towel, shower gel and shampoo are provided. And if I'm not mistaken there was a hair dryer too.They have vending machine on the reception floor, and guests can also buy a prepaid card for pay TV.The breakfast is simple but enough to me. They serve toasts with butter and jam, tea, coffee, and other 'basics'.The nearest JR Station is Nihombashi (Exit D2), and the even closer one is Mitsukoshi-mae Subway Station Exit A4 and B6 (near Mitsukoshi Department Store).Now they have Ladies Floor.[-]", "Date": "Feb 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR384465590", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "zags"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d636780-r22254379-Hotel_Villa_Fontaine_Nihombashi-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "636780", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
