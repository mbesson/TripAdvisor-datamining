After I booked it I read some reviews on TripAdvisor and I was so worried that I had made a mistake... everyone made it sound so awful! I emailed them to confirm my reservation, and they were very nice and confirmed me for the main building, which surprised me because based on the price I paid (90 euro for two nights the weekend before carnivale) I assumed that we would be in the annex. We arrived in the late afternoon and a very nice guy at the desk checked us in. We enjoyed some friendly teasing banter with him, he was funny. The hotel is in a cozy corner on the street and really pretty on the inside. We had an adorable room (314) with a beautiful view of rooftops, and we could see the Campanile at San Marco from our bathroom window. I guess I can see what people mean when they say the rooms are small, but unless you're planning on running sprints around your bed, I wouldn't worry about it. We were on the third floor and though there was a lift we never took it, the stairs weren't bad. Maybe it was because we're spry college students :). I actually think our age played a big part in our enjoyment of the hotel, because it felt really really nice to us. I can see older people having complaints about the size of the room and the size of the shower and the stairs. One thing that struck us was how quiet it is! I guess with no cars, there's a lot less noise. we had a great night's sleep.Breakfast was yummy, and they'll bring it to you in your room in the morning which we loved.

Having been to the hotel now, I want to assuage anyone's fears and tell you that this hotel is very nice, clean, respectable, and just plain pretty.

I first chose Hotel Torino because of its fabulous location, just a few minutes walk from Piazza San Marco (I am handicapped, so I always choose to be very close to where I want to go). And, considering the usual prices for hotels in Venice, Torino ends up being really affordable. Of course it is not a 5-star hotel, nor does it pretend to have the commodities some tourists, especially americans, tend to look for in hotels abroad; but Torino does have something that is much more valuable for me - and that is character. The main building is actually a 15th-century Palazzo, and still has half a coat-of-arms in stone on the stairway hall; the rooms are furnished in true venetian style - some rooms even have the walls lined with fabric, silk or similar. I have known Torino for a few years now, and I know what some customers are talking about when they refer to \"bad rooms\", but I must say that the main building was completely refurbished recently and now has really great rooms. On the first floor, one of the rooms is especially prepared for handicapped persons and it is really fabulous. I added one of my pictures of that room. And Hotel Torino now has a lift on the main building, which is great for me and all handicapped or elderly customers, or even couples with small children, and it is not often that you can find a lift on the smaller Venice hotels, especially those situated in ancient or historical buildings. So, I heartily recommend Hotel Torino. I am going to Venice again next July (2010) and I have no doubt I will book Torino again.

The staff where very friendly and helpful. We where told our room number and found it with no problem. Our room had a double bed in the middle on the right with side tables, a set of drawers next to the window and a big wardrobe next to the door. Had a en-suite (not all rooms have en-suites) which was small but ideal with accessories to shower. The bed was comfortable and was made every day we where there. The furniture was old fashioned but what do you expect for such a beautiful city. The breakfast was continental and if it was busy you struggled to get into the small room which consisted of six 2 chaired tables. Cereals, croissants with coffee, tea and orange juice facilites where availble. This kept us going through the morning.All in all the hotel is ideal for a short stay which you don't spend alot of time in due to site seeing in Venice etc. Only a short walk from st marks square and the grand canel.

Instead of a room in the main hotel building we were made to walk to one of the annexes (in pouring rain) and told that our room was on the top floor (no lift), and this room was extremely small and uncomfortable. Quite disappointing. Later on however I spoke to the day staff, extremely nice and helpful people, who moved us to a lovely room in the main building, a great relief.
