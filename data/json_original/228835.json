We knew the location as we had stayed nearby twice before, but this time was for a special occasion with my husband and my parents for mums 70th birthday. We paid for the superior rooms and I emailed ahead to request at least one room with a balcony for my mum and we were told that the balcony rooms were smoking rooms, but that they would do their best. On arrival at 12 noon, we were told that we had been upgraded to \"deluxe\" - one with balcony and one without. Our room without the balcony was on the 2nd floor (room 206) and was on the corner of the building so we had fantastic views from all around - the windows are floor to ceiling and you can open them right out and there is a guard rail halfway up outside, so it practically WAS a balcony!! The room was beautiful - all pale creams and pale blues and the bathroom was sparkling and, I think, brand new. (The bathroom also had one of these huge windows so everywhere was so light and bright.) The hairdryer was pretty powerful and their was a minibar in the room so you could buy your own wine and store it in there - nice and cold. Plenty of space for clothes in the room and the bed was really comfortable. Not a lot of noise from outside considering we were right opposite the Madeleine - just a fantastic view, even when lying in bed - perfect! My parents room with the balcony was on the 5th floor, again on the corner so with fantastic views all around, but this had a wraparound balcony - bit high for me but my dad loved it! The decor in this room was a bit dark for my taste, but aside from that it was exactly the same room as ours - same layout, bathroom and lovely huge windows. (I think the decor is dark as it was a smoking room, but it did not smell one bit of smoke - my parents arent smokers but would have put up with a bit of smokey aroma in exchange for a balcony but it was fine and fresh and clean.) As everyone has already said, fantastic location, close to everything, staff were lovely and very helpful and we were very sad to leave. I cant wait to go back.

I absolutely enjoyed my week long business trip at this hotel. Transportation- from CDG airport the easiest and cheapest method is the Roissy bus to the Opera. In terminal 2a the bus is outside door 9 and is clearly marked. Cost is about 9 Euro, (you can get a ticket from the driver). From the Opera it's only a five minute walk to the hotel. Just map it before you leave so you know the streets to take to the hotel (there are only two, very simple). Since it was raining I took a cab from the bus. What a waste. The ride cost only 4.20 Euro but there is a minimum rate of 5.80 so I should have just walked. Check In - I arrived Sunday morning around 11am and was told that I couldn't check in until 2pm. Unfortunately it was raining and to my surprise just about every store in that part of town is closed on Sundays! So I had lunch at the cafe next door and then waited in the hotel lobby until the front desk let me check in around 2:30. I was so exhausted from my overnight flight from NY that I basically went to sleep when I got to my room and woke up the next morning for work. Which was actually a good thing because it eliminated most of my jet-lag. Accommodations- Room was small (typical for Europe) but fine for one and probably acceptable for two if you don't have a lot of luggage. It had two twin beds which were connected. Not the most comfortable beds but I had no problem sleeping. The bathroom had a shower/tub combo. I'm 5'6\" and had no problem with the shower height or stream power (although it could have been stronger). Closet was very small (it had a safe which you can rent the lock for 3Euros a night at the front desk) and there was a two drawer tiny dresser designed to put your suitcase on the top. TV had two English language channels, CNN World and BBC News. There was a mini-bar and a desk too. I did not pay for the hotel internet service and instead connected to an unsecure wireless network that my computer picked up. Best part of the room was the window. It was HUGE, with a little iron trellis across it when you opened both sides. Breakfast - The hotel buffet was convenient. Nothing terribly special, but it was fresh. Easier to eat there than trying to find restaurants open early in the morning (many restaurants are not open before 8am). The buffet had breads, croissants, butter, jam, cream cheese, poached eggs, ham (deli-style), cheddar cheese, four cereals (corn flakes, museli, chocolate crisps and I think the last was Special K), dates/raisins, juices, yogurts and coffee/tea. It cost 12 Euros a day. A little costly for what you get but it would be hard to find the same for less in that area. Commuting - I took the Metro to my office throughout the week. Very easy to use the Metro to get around the city. The entrance to the Madeleine stop is on the side of the hotel. Get a pass if you're going to use it for more than a few days. Shopping - GREAT AREA for high end shops. Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 is an amazing street for fashion just a few blocks away. In the other direction are some huge department stores. Just remember that most shops don't open until mid-day and close by 7 or 8pm. And as I mentioned before most are not open on Sundays. Frankly I'm shocked by the limited hours. It was hard to fit in much shopping after working all day. But since this was a business trip and not a 'vacation' I really can't complain. If you have all day to wander around though you'll be fine. Overall the hotel was more than sufficient, centrally located, comfortable, clean and the staff was very nice. The front desk staff spoke English and were more than willing to help with anything you needed. I would absolutely return again. One note: don't book on their website, either call or use a travel agent. They overbooked someone the first night and told him it was because the internet booking gets lowest priority.

Firstly we received what you could hardly call a warm welcome and then we also had a bad experience . . . On buying an hour internet pass we logged on had a quick google then logged off using the necessary windows on screen. We went on later and the message said the time had expired. I went down to speak to the lady on reception only to be told you have to use it in one go, which it does not say anywhere as far as I could see. Fair enough and we weren't told this when we bought it. She promptly apologised and said we should have been told this and it was their fault . . . I had to ask for another pass and she tried to charge us another 9EUR. On asking whether we got this for free, she said no sorry we would have to pay, reminding her she'd just admitted it was the hotel's fault she said sorry but there wasn't a lot she could do and the general message was \"tough luck\". However, she did say she would speak to the manager. On giving her my room number so she could call us we never received a phone call. On paying the hotel bill when leaving I'd decided not to bring up the internet situation when paying as I couldn't really be bothered with an argument over 9EUR which I sense we'd have gotten into and bearing in mind we wanted to leave our bags there it was probably better not to go there! On settling the bill we were dealt with by a member of staff who generally strutted around in a manner that suggested she thought she was better than everyone else and looked to have a poor attitude which was proved right when the only things we were asked were \"room?\", \"anything from the mini bar?\", \"389 euros\". No please, no thank you, no how was your stay, nothing curtious at all! When collecting our bags I did say something to a young guy behind the desk regarding who to write to regarding a complaint. He was very polite and we discussed it as he asked what the problem was and he understand my point of view and was generally a really nice guy, I was tempted to also mention the attitude of the staff member who checked us out too but she was over like I shot for a good ear wigging so couldn't really say anything! Besides this, room wise we went for a superior. It was a decent size, very Parisian and overlooked the Madeleine Church. We never bothered with breakfast as we just had a crossiant in the local cafes. We paid 190EUR a night which was reasonable considering the location, room size and view but to be honest, as stated, the general attitude of two or three members of staff soured our stay really.

It was not the best 3-star hotel I have ever stayed at in Paris but given the location and what I wanted to do in Paris for these 2 days (shop in this area of town!), I was happy with my choice. Here are the pros and cons of the Hotel Madeleine Plaza: PROS: 1. Great location - directly on the Pl. de la Madeleine and in the heart of an extensive shopping area. Metro stop is across the \"Place de la Madeleine\", only about 100 meters away. 2. Amazing views from our room. We booked their cheapest room (170 euros/nt.) and were given a room on the 5th floor which had a balcony and a view of the Eiffel Tower, as well as directly faced the Madeleine Church. 3. Hotel seemed well cared for and looked stylish. There were nice French prints on the walls, heavy toile de jouy curtains, refrigerator in room, coffee maker (instant) in room, nice small marble bathroom. The bar was cozy and had exposed brick walls for ambience. 4. Well priced for this location and quality of hotel.(170 euros/nt.) 5. Next door to Hediard (large gourmet food store) and Fauchon is about 100 meters away - similar gourmet food store. Fauchon is very good for the traveler as it has take away meals, breads and coffee but note that it is closed on Sunday. CONS: 1. Despite requesting a non-smoking room, we were given a room that clearly smelled of smoke. 2. Rude staff that told us that \"it was not permitted to have coffee sent up to the room. Only a full breakfast (12 euros pp) can be sent to the room.\" Now, if they can bring up a tray with a full breakfast, what is so hard about bringing up a pot of coffee and 2 cups??? I guess they wanted to force us into to their expensive breakfast deal. 3. This area of town is completely dead after 7 pm so if you are looking for cafe lilfe/nightlife, you would be better off staying in the St. Germain area. (Personally, I thought the peace and quiet was nice). The large cafe next door closes at 8 pm or so. We wanted to have a drink after dinner and there was absolutely nowhere to go except the hotel bar (v. mediocre wine served in brandy snifters. Not worth the 5 euros per glass.). 4. Room was stuffy.
