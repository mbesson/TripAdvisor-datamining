Usually I never write such reviews, but this... was a special treat. I booked the room for 2 of us with twin beds a month beforehand through the hotel's website. The fotos presented on the website were nothing to reality. The so called hotel is occupying a floor of the apartment building, and people, who live in this building do not like strangers coming to the hotel. It is understandable. I wouldn't neither. We arrived at 8 p.m., there was the lady (the owner's wife, it's a family business) at the tiny reception, who didn't find us at the booking list (though I have called them 3 times before arrival, saying that I was coming). The lady looked very concentrated and rigorous. Explained that she spoke no English, though pretended that she doesn't understand Russian or Slovenian (you know... you can tell when one is speaking your language).. it was ridiculous! )))) Ok... she is truly Italian ... let's let her be one ))) Eventually, after speaking on the phone with her husband, we got our room. The room was so small that 2 twins were as 1 queen size bed, pulled together. And while one was trying to move around the room, another one had to sit on the bed, cos there was no space for 2 of us at the same time. I can't say room was dirty.. but it wasn't clean... it didn't feel clean. The pillows smelled, so asked to change it, which has been done (thanks for that, by the way...). The closet smelled too, so my clothing got a bit stinking eventually. There was a lot of dust under the bed (I don't usually check floors in hotels rooms, you know, it happened accidentally that I saw it). I guess there is no need to say that the walls are so tiny, that you hear pretty much everything that is going on in the hotel. The breakfast... well... I tried one. Frankly, I don't see the need in breakfast at the hotel when you are in Rome, cos there are so many places you can go for breakfast and it is a special entertainment by it's own. But if you still need to have a hotel breakfast, do not have one in Piave - they do serve rotten ham and the coffee is terrible. The stuff... I didn't feel they were welcoming, I felt too much tension. The owner has a very special sense of humor which he expresses too often, on my opinion. And also, the have a very special alarm security system, so if you come back late at night (after 10 p.m.), you should be careful with the main entrance door, otherwise, if you open it wrong, you will wake up the owner's wife, who will appear in her bathrobe, being very unhappy. Yes, I realize quite well that in Rome there is no time to spend in a hotel room, but since you come back tired and need rest... you need to feel comfortable. And I am sorry, Piave is not the right place. After the great time we'd spent on Ischia and in Amalfy, that was an epic fail to spend our last 3 days in Piave. I guess, if you travel alone, it might be ok in the hotel, but if you are together, or family...

The room looked out into a tiny courtyard and although that conjurs images of romantic Italian vistas, it is nothing like it. In fact there is no view, therefore we kept the shutters closed pretty much all the time. But you don't go to Rome for a hotelview! Also, the walls are very thin, so you do hear other guests.

All things considered our stay was definitely more positive than negative, but we probably wouldn't stay again for the minor conveniences it did not have. On the positive side: The hotel is very nicely maintained and decorated, from the cool floors in the hallway to the breakfast room to the rooms and bathrooms. The staff is very nice. (Other reviews mentioned the woman serving breakfast not being pleasant, but I could not disagree more. She was a bit shy, but totally nice when engaged in conversation!) The room was small, but we had a toddler with us; I think the size would have been absolutely fine for 2 people only. The bed was comfortable, the TV worked well, and the bathroom was very new looking and nicely tiled. Breakfast buffet was small, but with good variety, and fresh. Both the fresh brioches and the fresh fruit were welcome treats each morning. We liked the neighborhood; it felt very local and the bus to Termini picks up a block away. The Trattoria Cadorna around the corner had good service and absolutely delicious and plentiful pasta dishes. Traveling with a small child was both the most positive and one of the negatives of the hotel. The small room gave did not provide much space for him to move around and there was no refrigerator in the room which was difficult in terms of providing our son with his regular meal and beverage schedule. BUT the staff was SO good to our son and so accommodating to us and our needs. They let us use their fridge and even provided us with milk twice a day (outside of breakfast hours) so we wouldn't have to worry about buying it. In addition, the hotel provided a travel crib in excellent condition at no additional cost. The Piave is most definitely a child friendly place! The biggest negative other than that just expressed was the air conditioning. It did not work well at all. We decided to stay in the room one afternoon to rest and escape the Roman heat, and though the air was turned on to full blast, I was actually sticky from the heat in the room. It did not matter how long the air ran or what setting it was on: the temperature bordered on uncomfortable. Another negative (picky, I know) was in the bathroom: looks great, but not completely functional. There was only space to hang one bath towel, and the shelf above the sink is curved: pretty, but not big enough for two people's toiletries because everything on the curved side slides down. The shower head was a bit blocked so water pressure and direction of spray was not the best. There were also sudden changes in temperature if water was used elsewhere. 3. The coffee at breakfast wasn't particularly good. After two tries, we skipped it all together. Finally, there was a big armoire in the room, but no drawers, so we had to live out of our suitcases.

For the money, I can't imagine a nicer, cleaner hotel in a comparable area of Rome. The Albergo Piave is a bit off the beaten path (at 14 Via Piave), but it is near-enough to anywhere one might want to go. It's about a 15 minute walk to Termini and Piazza Republica, a 30 minute walk to the historic area (Markets of Trajan, Forum, Colosseum), and less than five minutes to the nearest bus stop. To truly appreciate Rome, one must explore the city on foot and the Albergo Piave is a fine base from which to do just that. For those less inclined to walk, one can hop an over-priced cab and be most anywhere within 15 minutes or less (depending on traffic) or utilize the city's bus system, which, while seemingly daunting at first, is really quite easy if one just takes a moment to familarize oneself with a city map (the hotel will provide you with one) and then peruses the detailed signage at the bus stops (easy to understand even if you don't know Italian). In addition, there are some decent restaurants on or around Via Piave and the very-hip Friends Music Cafe just up the street from the hotel where you can enjoy a refreshing beverage after a long day of sight-seeing. The rooms at Albergo Piave are small but spectacularly clean, the beds are comfortable enough, and the bathrooms are very nice. The staff is helpful, although many of them speak little or no English, which can pose the occasional communication problem for the non-Italian speaker. We dealt with Sylvia for all business matters. She is usually there during mornings, is very polite and speaks very good English. It is important to remember that this is more of a bed and breakfast style hotel (breakfast is included in the price of the room). Thus, there is not always someone available at the front desk, especially at night. If you're looking for a place with 24-hour room service, Albergo Piave is not it. You will be given a key for the front gate (the hotel is on the 4th floor of an office/apartment building) and a key card for the hotel floor so that you can come and go as you please. The situation worked out perfectly well for my wife and I, although I admit there were a couple of occasions when I wished a concierge or at least an English-speaking desk attendant were available. Also, Thomaso, the older gentlemen who is something like the hotel's \"super\" , can be a bit overbearing at times, although once you get used to him, he's harmless, even rather charming. He means well, but his gruff manner and inability to speak or understand English might make him a bit off-putting to the average westerner at first. By the end of our stay, however, he had endeared himself to us. For someone coming to Rome to really see and explore the city, Albergo Piave is a reasonably-priced, clean, and comfortable place to do so. There's so much to see and do in Rome.

Anyway would recommend this Hotel for budget conscious and close proximately to Termini and also its friendly staff and comfortable interiors.", "Date": "March 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery very pleased with Albergo Hotel\u201d", "Author": "LopezLopez", "ReviewID": "UR5954980", "Content": "My husband, 2-year old son and myself stayed at the Albergo Piave for 4 nights, from the 24 to the 28 of September. The rooms are rather cosy, and that's the only negative thing I can say about this hotel. We were treated extremely well by all members of staff, including Tomaso the owner, Patrizia, Giorgio and his family and everyone we saw. The rooms yes, are cosy, but the price truly reflects this. The room was extremely clean as well as the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and they kindly lent us a cot for our son. The shower was awesome and they even put some toiletries for your use. The continental breakfast was delicious and very satisfying; the pastries are sooooo nice, it's the one thing I miss the most about Rome. Some people have commented that this hotel is a bit out of the way. We didn't find this to be the case at all. We walked absolutely everywhere and were in the 'centre' within 15 minutes at the most (with a pushchair!!). We actually found the location to be perfect for us and appreciated being away from the most touristy areas for dinner; there are lots of restaurants around the hotel which don't feel like tourist traps, and there's even a 'La Rinascente' within 5 minutes walk. This hotel is also within walking distance to Villa Borghese. If we go back to Rome on a budget (if such a thing is possible!!!) we would undoubtedly stay at Albergo Piave again, absolutely!", "Date": "October 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sevilla", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "rocco73", "ReviewID": "UR5773172", "Content": "The better thing about our staying in Rome.The city is nice and charming, but dark and dangerous-looking too, and very hot in August.

The room was a good size, recently renovated with good centrally operated AC, a nice clean bathroom and swanky shower, good sized bed and TV. The only thing that let this hotel down from a 5 star was the slight rudeness of the reception staff before we left. An elderly gentleman (owner/manager?) asked us for the cash to pay, when I said we would be paying by credit card he insisted on cash (even though a sign at reception says 'Proudly Accepting Master and Visa Cards'), when I told him we didnt have it his suggestion was to go to the bank and get it. When I finally made him realise the cash wasnt there to be had, end of, and if he didnt take the credit card there would be no money to pay he told me his credit card machine was broken. Basically I left saying nothng and returned ten minutes later with my card, which I gave it to him he said 'no cash?' I said no and he took the card, magically the machine was working! It ruined the stay a little but not so much I wouldnt recommend the hotel for budget travellers!", "Date": "August 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westchester, NY", "Title": "\u201cComfort at a very good price.\u201d", "Author": "Dagnini21", "ReviewID": "UR5516743", "Content": "Best features: friendly staff, nice breakfast, big bed, huge drapes that keep out sharp morning light, very quiet, and lovely bathroom.

Would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a comfortable room to stay while on vacation.
