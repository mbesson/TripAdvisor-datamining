This was one of them and it's a real gem. I checked in at the counter where they told me there was a refundable pet deposit and a nightly pet fee. The deposit is refundable only if there's no damage. The rooms are a bit smaller than the newer hotels but the refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker with complimentary coffee grounds more than made up for the rooms small size. The bed was super comfortable and the TV channel list was very long which included the History Channel, Discovery Channel, Weather Channel, and other cable and local channels. There is a bank with 24 ATM next door and several local type restaurants within walking distance and several that will deliver. I recommend Geordiano's if you're looking for some deep dish pizza, it's what they're famous for. As I said before, this hotel is pet friendly with a refundable deposit and a nightly fee.

The beds were in terrific shape and everything alse seemed to be really clean on the surface. A normal person might not have noticed it but I have a 9 month old who is a very new and enthusiastic crawler. On the first full day there I had given him a bath and put a diaper on him and was letting him crawl around while getting my 3 year old dressed for a family dinner out. At dinner my friend was playing with him and said \"those are nasty bruises\" but the bruises on his knees wiped off. I thought he had gotten into something but that night while he was cruising around the hotel I noticed his socks were filthy along with his hands and anywhere else that was in contact with the carpet, On the next day my brother arrived (we were in town for a wedding).I had booked two rooms and I went with him to check him in. I was going to say something about the floors but was thrown off by a truly nasty front desk clerk who gave me a hard time because I had forgotten my AAA card but had my husbands (which he was staying with me and it was our joint credit card that was paying for the rooms) Even if it was a policy she could have been a whole lot nicer about it and she embarassed me in front of my brother's guest and everyone else in the lobby. I stewed on that interaction all night long and it ruined any chance of sleep I had. To be fair I never complained about the rug in the room.

Relatively easy to get downtown, but takes a while. Now... the less good. First, the rooms are fairly ordinary. Very small, with a small double bed. The bathroom is tiny. The shower curtain only covered half the shower, consequently water went everywhere. The rooms were also dingy. We had a room on the second floor, up the back, so very little light got in. All in all a fairly miserable atmosphere. Second, our room was not clean to the degree expected. Although the bathroom etc was clean, the carpet felt and looked as though it could do with a good thorough stem clean. It felt dirty to walk on, and I noticed hair on my socks after walking around in the room. Third, the breakfast was average at best. No-where to sit, we gave it a miss after the first morning. If stale dunkin donuts and cold breakfast sandwiches appeal to you then you may like it... Overall, I can't recommend this, although the staff are very helpful.

Sadly, the motel itself lacks some basics. We stayed in an upper floor (there are two), and all room entrances are to the outside. I can only imagine the fun in the Chicago winters, as there was a 3/4\" gap at the front door. The room itself was Euro-tiny. The double bed was firm, not quite rock-hard but uncomfortably close. There is a coffee maker, but no carafe, as the coffee exits into supplied styrofoam cups. There is a microwave and fridge, but there is but one tiny table afixed to the wall, and one chair. Don't be a couple, please. There are NO food preparation surfaces. The room's AC/heater unit blows directly onto the bed; hope you like the breeze. The walls are thin, and if you don't mind listening to the couple next door's sex life, you'll turn on the bathroom fan as we did. The bathroom door was incorrectly mounted and was difficult to close at all. The bathroom is tiny, and we surmise that larger people will have difficulty in it. There is supplied soap and body wash from dispensers in the shower/tub. The room was clean, although one wall photo had somewhat melted from repeated bathroom condensation. The breakfast amounts to fruit, yogurt, and bagels/Dunkin Donuts offerings, with coffee (reasonable) and tea. There is almost no place to sit; perhaps three small cafe tables for all of the guests that want breakfast; a bottom rung sort of endeavor. Parking is tight, and it is close to the Orange Line; shopping nearby if you need; the I-55 ramp to downtown and other destinations is a mile away. Midway Airport is about five minutes.

I first spoke with Valerie who steered me away from the expensive airport car rental places (later I found these taxes to be about $30 daily) and towards the Enterprise around the corner. She said they would be glad to pick me up at the airport to pick up my car. Valerie asked what was bringing me to Chicago and I explained I was attending a wedding in the suburbs during the weekend and would be staying at the Carlton so I could see Chicago in a day. Valerie assured me that they would help me with my sightseeing. I called the night before to confirm what Valerie had promised; and sure enough, Tommy set me up for a pick up - all I needed to do was call once I landed. Well, everything went great and I was on my way to Naperville for the weekend. On Monday, upon my return to the city, I called the Carlton and Serena sent the van to get me. There was a bit of a snafu with the car so the van came, got my bags, and left with a promise to come right back once I was ready. When I was finally on my way, the van driver told me that they had the room ready for me and that he had placed my luggage in the room already. This was a great plus - it was only 12 noon! Soon, I was ready to go into the city. Tommy and Serena both mapped me stations, paths, places etc... They were awesome! They even sell train day passes right on site! The van driver dropped me at the train station and said to call when I returned. My day in Chicago was amazing! The next morning, so was the breakfast in the lobby! There was juice, coffee, dunkin donuts a plenty, dunkin donut egg and sausage biscuits, bagels and cream cheese, and yogurt. Not your typical scanty continental breakfast. And, as I ate, I watched Valerie and Tommy both continually filling the donuts and sandwiches. Oh, and did I happen to mention Buddy the dog? Buddy is a beautiful, gentle dog that I like to think of as the mascot of the Carlton. He made the place even homier. When I go back to Chicago, I intend to stay again. The service was great. I know you are also interested in the actual accommodations so I will mention that the room was large and clean. There was a nice sitting chair, and a table and chairs.

I did a search on the on demand, and found something light to watch as I fell asleep. The only think I might mention is that being near the airport, there is a bit of noise.

On 30 May 11, we stayed at the Midway Carlton Inn in Chicago. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stayed at the motel a week or two before, and I wrote a glowing report of the motel. The management of the motel is outstanding, as was the service and the cleanliness of the room. We had received first class service the first time and fully expected it again. So we were astounded at the difference 12 days made. This time, the room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so clean. This time, we needed to go down to the office to get hand towels. This time, there was no coffee, and the maid had failed to empty the coffee grounds from the last customer. The tub hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned, indeed, it was clogged, something we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find out until, unfortunately, the water backed up while I was showering. There were hairs a foot long in the tub. I have short hair, and my husband is bald. So I left the housemaid a tip: a Canadian nickel. I also filled out the comment card, expressing my dismay at the poor cleaning job, the lack of attention to common details, and especially the dirty tub. The next day, I was home, and received a phone call. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember her name, but the woman was calling from the Carlton Inn. She had received and read my comments and was appalled. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t their standard, she said, this was completely out of the ordinary. She apologized profusely, saying the maid was newly hired (and, I hope, considering her lackadaisical approach to doing a simple job like cleaning a room, fired). The woman said that, because of the poor service I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d received, she was going to credit (refund) my money for the cost of the room. She did. For the HIGHER rate. She asked that I forgive her (as if she were to blame!) and to consider staying with them the next time I was in Chicago. I was amazed, and mollified. I've seen worse housemaid performance, but was so surprised at the difference. I certainly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a refund. But I was definitely impressed, all over again, with the high caliber of service I received from the Carlton Inn. It is apparent to me that the managers of Carlton Midway Inn take high quality service seriously. They pay attention to their customers comments, both good and bad, and act on them as needed. And they do it NOW. I know they read Trip Advisor. So, I say, Yes, ma'am, I promise. The next time we're in Chicago, we will be staying at your Inn.

One train(CTA) stop from Midway Airport, five-minutes walk from CTA station and 20 minutes to downtown by CTA...I believe this convenient location is the best part of this hotel. (You can use the shuttle bus to go to airport and CTA station, too!) Furthermore, the room price is around $100 per night if you book in advance. You cannot find such good deal normally with such convenient location in Chicago. This price includes complimentary breakfast, fitness center and free parking! I believe you can save $200 per night just by staying at this hotel. With this saving, you can enjoy good meals, concerts and museums in downtown! Accommodations are kind of average or above a bit with this price but I have no complaint about them. Only complaint I have for this hotel is there is little space to have breakfast in the lobby. It means I have to bring the meals back to my room. As an additional caution, if you come here by your car, be sure arriving earlier to ensure your parking space.

It's not super swanky, but the service was absolutely exceptional. I chose this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel that was the closest to the center of Chicago. Because the rates were so much cheaper at the Carlton Inn than at other hotels in the city, I really wasn't expecting much. And then they completely blew me away with their outstanding customer service. I had accidentally booked a smoking room and they upgraded my friend and I to a bigger, non-smoking room at no extra charge. Upon learning that it was my first visit to Chicago, they also provided us with maps and tour booklets and explained the train system to us. They offered to help us plan our sightseeing trips once we decided what we wanted to see. Talea was running the front desk when I checked in and she gave me her business card and told us to call anytime, day or night, if we had any questions, or got lost and needed help getting back to the hotel. A driver was also available to take us to buy public transit day passes, as well as drive us to, and pick us up from, the train station. By the time we left, they knew our names, where we were from, and why we were in Chicago. Every time we walked into the office, even if it was just to grab a bagel or a takeout menu, they chatted with us and asked us how our stay was going. They did everything they could to make our stay comfortable and memorable. Location: the location is great. It's only two or three blocks from the train station, so downtown Chicago is quite convenient. Room: the room was small, but very clean and comfortable. The internet connection was a little slow, but the hotel was so hospitable otherwise that I hardly noticed. Breakfast: Breakfast was simple, but fresh. They provide yogurt, fruit, fresh donuts, bagels, and bagel sandwiches from Dunkin Donuts, as well as coffee, juice, and tea. They also provided little trays so that you can carry breakfast back to your room, if you wish. I really appreciated this little added convenience. While I stayed at the Carlton Inn, I felt like I was a guest in someone's home, rather than a hotel customer. Every time I go back to Chicago, I'll be staying at the Carlton Inn. They have really set the standard for hotel hospitality. It's so clear that whoever runs this hotel really has a passion for what they do and they pass that enthusiasm down to each of their employees.

The station is about three blocks from the motel, not far at all for me and my hiking husband. Everyone was so very generous with their time, so eager to make our stay a good one.

All I knew was that I was on a budget and it was affordable. However, my stay was much better than expected. If I could, I would actuall give the hotel 3 1/2 stars, but since I cannot, I went higher rather than lower because of the amazingly helpful staff that was great for a first-time visitor to the city. Pros: 1. Again, the staff was amazingly helpful. I was able to get around the city with ease because of their help, which I did not even need to ask for. It was offered freely. 2. The hotel is located within walking distance (approximately a quarter mile) of the orange line of the elevated train, which can take you from the Midway airport all the way to all the downtown attractions for very little money, and you can transfer to other trains to get to where the orange line does not go. Because of that, I ended up never needing my rental car. 3. Continental breakfast daily. I cannot give a full review of this because when I went to eat, it was almost time for it to end, but despite that, the food that was left still tasted fresh and there was a nice variety. 4. Free Internet. Of course, most hotels and motels have this nowadays, but it is still a perk and worth mentioning if you are staying here anyway. Cons: 1. The room was a bit on the small side, so depending on how much time you plan to spend in your room, you might find it is too small for your needs, though it does have all the basics in the room. 2. The exterior wall is apparently a bit thin and while the neighborhood isn't extremely noisy, when a loud noise does happen outside, it can be heard pretty clearly. 3. The bathtub, like the room itself, is a bit small and the water pressure is low. And lastly, this could be a pro or a con depending on your preference, the beds have a pretty firm mattress, rather than the extremely soft ones you find in the big chain hotels.

We stayed at Candlewood Suites O'hare a couple nights before on the weekend, and to compare they had a $65/night rate, plus a full kitchen although location was not as close to the train, and there was no breakfast included. (Candlewood was a nicer stay overall, although Carlton Inn was acceptable also. We had a car, but didn't want to drive downtown , so we thought staying closer to a train stop was a good idea- which it kind of was...) Check-In was smooth- Desk clerk was fast & friendly- even gave us a list of recommended places to eat closeby. Room was clean- airconditioner was on in advance which was nice- available of a fridge was convenient (although it wasn't plugged in, we discovered the next morning that we had to plug it in directly rather than via the microwave, which wasn't working). Bathroom was a bit small in our room- a small pedestal sink with a shelf above it was all you got for counterspace- but it was adequate I suppose. Soap & shampoo were in a dispenser. Towels were white and fluffly & clean looking. Bathroom was clean overall & water pressure was decent, and hot water available very quickly. Room itself was on the dark side- area lighting was good, but even when everything was turned on (bedside lamps x 2 , worktable lamp, bathroom light w/ door open- the room was still fairly dim... maybe alright for some people- I like my room to be bright- better to see everything is clean, where all my stuff is...) Room was a nice size- had a separate desk area - the free highspeed wireless internet worked well for us. We had to call the front desk for the passwords. TV was a CRT- channels were decent. Breakfast was nicer than the average continental variety- The bagel w/sausage & egg was good especially with the thoughtful instructions about how to reheat - There were also doughnuts, oranges, apples, bread/bagel for toasting, coffee, tea. A decent enough spread. There was one computer in the lobby area which was free to use- also free printing which was nice. My gripes (mostly not the hotel's fault)- Since it was a motel setup- 2 floors, 2 separate buildings, the parking spots were not always ideal, especially if you don't get your spot early on- first night the closest parking spot we got was way on the other side of our building- so with our luggage to haul in, it wasn't convenient- but I guess with all the rooms they had, there's no way to guarantee a spot close to you room. Also, since it's a motel setup- there's no way you can open up your drapes (to make the room brighter) without losing all your privacy (especially on the 1st floor)- plus we had a hard time overlapping the drapes closed so that people couldn't see in. With a 1st floor room, you get a lot of noise pollution potentially. We had a maid on the first morning talking with a friend or a cellphone to her buddy in spanish just outside our window-- woke me up. Also some other guests (inconsiderate) had a meeting/long conversation somewhere outside our room and you could hear almost every word. If you are a light sleeper, maybe request a 2nd floor room. Overall - a good stay for our first time in Chicago. We went mainly for see the city and eat with some other touristy distractions like museums thrown in. Next time, we will stay somewhere more north of downtown- that seems to be where a lot of the restaurants & stores we are interested in are located.

Although we only booked one night at the motel and had said that we would be leaving that day, they allowed us to leave our vehicle parked in their lot for the day while we went downtown so that we could avoid parking costs and the hassle of driving downtown. They also gave us a lift to Midway station instead of the closer Pulaski station on the Orange Line so that we could purchase a daypass ticket and were helpful on telling us the route that we should take to get to each of our planned destinations. When we got to Midway it turned out that they no longer sell day passes, so as a future reference for those visiting and taking the rail or busses you can save your time and have them drop you off at Pulaski station and save about 10 minutes. The parking and shuttle were both free of charge. The neighbourhood was also fine. Nothing exceptional and probably 15-20 minutes from downtown by the rail and was nothing special, but it was a decent enough neighbourhood for walking in and finding food and such.
