The St-Suplice area is a great area to stay. The hotel itself was extremely nicely apportioned, and our room, while very small (we got the classic), was well-maintained and nice. The staff, while not necessarily outgoing, was helpful when asked. Our biggest complaint was that the hotel is next to an elementary school, and from about 9:30am onward M-F, there were kids playing in the schoolyard with the occasional school bell. This wasn't a distant sound - it was extremely up close and personal if you were trying to sleep in. We had a 5th floor room with a veranda overlooking the garden (#52), so we may have gotten the worst of the sound. When we brought it up to the staff, they told us there were double pane windows, and that's all they could do. I stayed in a hotel in Florence where our window opened to a busy street - but they had soundproof glass and we never heard a peep. Villa Madame needs to know that \"double pane\" and \"soundproof\" are not the same thing. It would be a great upgrade to the hotel. If you are a traveler who is up and out at 8am, don't worry about the noise, but if you want to eat and drink until the wee hours and sleep in (at least during the school year), maybe there's a better hotel for you.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cA lovely Paris Hotel\u201d", "Author": "SydneyAlan", "ReviewID": "UR126837420", "Content": "Enjoyed our stay enormously.

Arriving after a hot and dusty train ride across France, it was a cool oasis of calm and comfort. We were greeted warmly and shown to a room in which we were a little disappointed in terms of size. We have stayed in Paris many, many times and are under no illusion about the average room size. Perhaps it was because we had spent most of the day in a stuffy, cramped train carriage - we just wanted more space, so we asked and were moved without problem to a slightly larger one, but it made all the difference. The decor is muted and very chic, fabrics soft and crisp appropriately and the hotel is very clean. The bathrooms are shiny and white with delicious Hermes products. I'm afraid I have to admit to not being able to leave my orange flower body lotion and potions behind! I hope you'll let me come back...... The bedding was extremely comfortable - we slept well - and there were little extras like slippers and complementary mineral water in the fridge, replenished daily. All of the above is what one would expect from a 4* hotel, but what makes Villa Madame that bit special was the following: * Very friendly and helpful reception staff. We needed to confirm a very hard-to-get reservation at a fashionably elusive restaurant. The receptionist persevered on our behalf and he got hold of them, standing for none of their nonsense, or else they would have turned us away.......but that's another review! * Beautiful little shaded garden in which one can chat, read, order tea or drinks at any time. There are candles and blankets for chilly nights. *Lovely salon with many books and games at your disposal and a fire which would be cosy in the Winter. There is a small bar which was never occupied, but looked as if it would be fun if it were. *All the extra touches around the hotel like drawings, paintings and photos. Not the usual hotel bland stuff, but GOOD, interesting pieces. (We are design lecturers, so we notice that stuff.) The candles, the objets d'art, the plants - all engendering an atmosphere of mutual respect between hotel and guest. We didn't have breakfast as we preferred to lie in and then wander off for a coffee, perhaps to the Luxembourg Gardens. There is a friendly neighborhood cafe almost opposite. But we did order beers, wine and teas in the garden, none of which was overpriced. (Though I would have liked a little biscuit or macaroon with my tea.)

Pressed, 51 E. Lunch at a sidewalk Brasserie for four, over 100 E. And breakfast at the hotel is a great experience. The carpets in the rooms could have been cleaner. The soap and toiletries should have been replaced on day three without us asking. Honestly, that stuff is irrelevant. I'd stay here again anytime.

It is a 5 minute or so walk to the gardens and you can jog/walk/visit easily. That is why I chose this particular hotel since I love to start out my day with a jog in the gardens. Negatives: I would not recommend this hotel if you arrive early in the morning and hope to check in. I arrived around 6am after being on an overnight flight from Africa. My room was not ready until 12:30pm (2pm is the normal check in time) so I had to wait in the hotel lobby living room all those hours when all I wanted to do was catch a nap, shower and then get out and explore. This is not the hotel's fault, but it is a reason to stay at a larger chain that has more rooms (this hotel did have some open rooms but not at my fare) so that you can check in should you arrive really early or late. The thing that really bothered me about this hotel though was that the staff at the front desk. The main lady who was there when I arrived early morning was not very friendly and just said there was nothing she could do about my early arrival. I understand given that I arrived before check in time, however she was not welcoming, did not offer me the bathroom or water or tea or anything to make my wait more comfortable, and I sat there for hours and hours, freezing cold with a scarf wrapped around my head. I eventually confronted her about this reception and we worked it out and made peace and she was pleasant the next two days I was there. Still, for all the money I would hope for something a bit more welcoming upon arrival! Once I got to my room is was very nice-very tasteful decoration- but teeny tiny and barely enough room for one person and a suitcase. Seems like a lot of money to pay for a less than welcoming reception and a tiny room. The bathroom was small but modern with very nice toiletries and good shower pressure.

She hates anything touristy, and she loved this place. We stayed the last week in June--VERY hot in Paris that week, and while many eateries, stores, and the metro did not have A/C, the hotel did, working just fine. It is in a PERFECT location of the city--the 6th, very local. The street is near 2-3 metro stops, and just one block from the Luxenbourg Gardens. There is a school next door, but street is dead quiet at night, so light sleepers will be fine. The hotel decor is modern, with a lovely sitting room in the lobby and japanese garden in back. The staff is very friendly & helpful. Very comfortable room, WONDERFUL beds. Nice modern bathrooms, strong shower and deep tub. And outlets in convenient locations throughout (as opposed to a single one- over the sink). Free wifi in the rooms plus one computer to use for free in the living room. They have breakfast at an additional charge--we only had it once, taking full advantage of the cafes in the immediate area--and it was very nice. Great for couples and small groups of friends. Probably not the cheapest hotel to be found, but if you are able to spend 100 euro or so per person, it is worth it. Little things like quality, non-touristy restaurants in the immediate area, a/c in your room when it's 90+ degrees out, modern plumbing, free wifi & internet, 24 hour desk, and a safe quiet street are essential to us when we travel, and the Villa Madame had all this & then some.", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Indiana1000", "ReviewID": "UR33551858", "Content": "The hotel is beautifully decorated, with a welcoming library style lobby and a wonderful secluded, courtyard garden with fountain.

My wife and I enjoyed our stay there immensely. This hotel is chic and luxuriously comfortable especially for the price. Admittedly, the room we had (Classic Double Room) was the smallest hotel room my wife and I had ever seen at about 3m x 3.5m (10' x 12'). The large outdoor terrace, fantastic bathroom (with Herm\u00e8s products and great water pressure), deliciously comfortable bed, iPod docking station, super-fast free wi-fi and excellent service more than made up for the tiny room. Alex at the front desk was a delight as she answered our every question and was always happy to chat and share information. The location is excellent being only a few minutes walk from either the Rennes or St-Sulpice Metro stops, 100m from the beautiful Jardin du Luxembourg and within easy walking distance of the myriad of shops and restaurants on both the Rue de Rennes and Boulevard Saint-Germain. The hotel serves a decent continental breakfast which seems expensive at 18\u20ac but we found a package that was below the normal rate and included breakfast. The breakfast room, as other reviewers have noted, is small and has only four tables for two. All of the tables were occupied each time we went for breakfast but the hotel happily served us as we sat in the little lounge area so it wasn't ever a problem. They don't serve lunch or dinner but there are two brasseries within 50m of the front door and many more restaurants and coffee shops just a few blocks away. There were a few other minor concerns that I had regarding this hotel: - The minibar is stocked only with two bottles of water. It would be nice if there was a limited selection of other beverages and also a kettle for tea/coffee service. - The satellite television has almost 900 channels (yes, I went through them all late one night) but half of them are Arabic and almost all of the rest are in French save for one German language station, a couple of Italian stations and only Bloomberg for the English speakers. Although one doesn't go to Paris to watch TV in the room, it's nice to relax and watch the news or a movie after a long day on the town but unless the above suits you, you won't have much cause to even turn on the set. - The street is very small and it is very difficult to find parking. This is likely not a problem for most visitors but is something to keep in mind especially if you rent a car. Overall, my wife and I loved this hotel. The few cons are heavily outweighed by the comforts we enjoyed. We are very seasoned travelers and despite the tiny room, this hotel experience was one of our best ever.

The hotel is well located and very tastefully decorated in a modern style. Our room - #21, an executive-type, was large (approx. 11 by 18), bright, with three large windows, and very comfortable and clean. We heard so much about small rooms in Paris, and I don't know what other rooms at Villa Madame are like, but we had a queen bed, chaise lounge, small table, desk, and plenty of storage for our things. It was a nice place to relax at the end of the day. The bathroom was large with both tub and shower. Wi-fi and local and international phone calls are included in the price. The breakfast was excellent and although not a buffet it was plentiful - a basket of bread, croissants and jams; cereal (on request), yogurt, fruit salad, juice and coffee. The woman who served us spoke no English, but was very nice and accommodating. Small but lovely common areas - fireplaced living room / dining room, pretty courtyard, and nice breakfast and lounge area. In my opinion, the website doesn't do the hotel justice. The staff did not always have answers to our questions, but they were friendly and always tried to help. Another reviewer mentioned no coffee machine but they are willing to make you coffee upon request. I was very worried about the location but it was perfect. Quiet, residential street but there was a nice pastry shop, very good wine and cheese shop, a cafe and a few restaurants right on the corner. A market was a block away; a laundromat was near St. Sulpice a block or so away (and right near Gerard Mulot pastry!). A couple of metro lines were close by. Luxembourg Gardens around the corner was lovely, and within 5 minutes we were in the heart of St. Germain. It's maybe10-15 minutes to the Seine.

We arrived before check-in and were greeted warmly, had our bags stored and were directed to a great cafe for a bite to eat while our room was being prepared. We had booked through the hotel's website and found ourselves upgraded to a terrace room which was superb! The terrace itself was fantastic, large with table/chairs as well as a sun lounge surrounded by a superb garden on the top floor. If you looked hard enough you could see the top of the Eiffel Tower which was nice. The room itself was adequate in size, well-appointed with a decent sized bathroom (for Europe), modern and very clean. I can't comment on the breakfast as we preferred to venture out for our meals. As other reviewers have noted, there is a school next door and those parisian kids sure know how to make some noise, but we didn't find it that disruptive. When the kids weren't around it was very quiet and relaxing. We will definitely stay here again.
