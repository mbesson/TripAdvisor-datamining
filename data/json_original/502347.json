Not understanding a word in Turkish, I was hoping that what I heard from the airline agent was something like \"Four Seasons\". Unfortunately, it was only the \"All\" Seasons, a very simple hotel, with dated furniture and tiny rooms (the elevator also was really tiny and slow). Not finding instructions to dial to the front desk, I went down in person to ask for a wake-up call at 6:30 am. The guy answered that they \"usually call at 7 am\", but I insisted to be called at 6:30 am. He wrote my request in a form and, guess what, no wake-up call at 6:30 on next morning. They only called at 7 am. The included breakfast is not so bad if compared to the rest of the hotel, but this is probably because we ate there once. The only available juice was not fresh, and it was made from artificial fruit powder. Bread was available in several options. As per the folder available in the room, if I recall, the hotel is ten-years old but appears to be older, due to the worn out furniture, carpet and other appliances in the room (except for a small flat screen TV).", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Odorheiu Secuiesc, Romania", "Title": "\u201cCarefully with these guys\u201d", "Author": "Lewiswalker", "ReviewID": "UR117258094", "Content": "The kindness of the hotel staff is the same as in any street in New York .

I arrived early this morning, and it has been absolutely horrendous! AVOID AT ALL COSTS! YOU ARE BETTER OFF SLEEPING ON A PARK BENCH THAN SLEEPING HERE!! (I'm not kidding!) Upon arriving in my tiny triple room I noticed that the air-conditioning wasn't working. I called the front desk 3 times and waited over an hour until someone finally came to look at it.. They came with a FAN!! Apparently air-conditioning doesn't work during the day, \"it rests from the night\".. Are they kidding?! This is Istanbul!! IT gets quite hot during the day!! but no AC! About an hour later I try using the washroom for the first time, BUT THERE IS NO WATER! The toilette doesn't flush and sink and shower don't work. I call down, this time two people come up and say the water should be back on in an hour! Seeing that we had two small children and that it was hot like the sahara dessert in our room they offered to bring us some drinking water (which is not provided in the rooms...) They brought a large bottle which was refilled with tap water from downstairs (the cap was not sealed and water was literally up to the top of the cap). The room itself is very small (see pics) and run down, the carpet is hanging loose from the floor, TV is the size of an old computer monitor with only one english channel (BBC), bathroom is old, shower has black stains all over.. SO HOW DID I END UP HERE?! I was on transit through Istanbul and Turkish Air gives free accommodations. I called before hand to find out what type of hotels they offer, and they said 4-5*, I asked them to name one of the hotels and they said the Marriott, so I figured I was good... What a horrible mistake. I have already booked a room on my way back at the Courtyard airport. I have travelled extensively over the years and did not have any high expectations. Generally, regardless of how bad a room is, if there is good AC and a clean bathroom I'm happy. This place had none of that! I think tripadvisor should remove the TOP VALUE logo from this property as it's hardly got ANY value!", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cThe worst horrible hotel of Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Turkishdelight2010", "ReviewID": "UR64132154", "Content": "In may 2010, I stayed at this hotel for 1 week and I have 1 conclusion, which is = this is the most horrible hotel in Istanbul, if not, in the world! If you want to enjoy your stay in Istanbul please avoid this place. Why?, because: 1) The staff members, especially at the reception, are amateurs, very rude and they even cursed at me, before I left the hotel. 2) Every room has airco, but they refuse to turn it on (save money) 3) Their website describes that the rooms have insulated windows and walls against sound. This is not true, because you can still hear the traffic when you close the windows, so you can't sleep comfortably 4) The view of the hotel is horrible, because all you can see is a hotel in front of you 5) The website describes that every room has satellite TV. Well I had 4 channels, but without sound. 6) Do not accept their airport transfer. They ask double price, take a bus or arrange a taxi at the airport, which will go for less. 7) For all the activities (sauna, playroom, etc) you have to pay additionally 8) Their website describes that it has WiFi, but the most of the time the internet connection is bad, not working. 9) Too many reasons to name............
