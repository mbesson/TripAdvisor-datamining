March 3, 2012. I must state that my husband and I stayed here for a conference and we stayed for free. Given that we stayed for free, you can take my review as you wish. We stayed on the 9th floor in room 901. This is their standard room. There is nothing to complain about. The bed wonderful, the bathroom is great, especially the deep soaker tub and the high-end Kohler fixtures are great. The shower is very small...I never used it, but my husband said it was small. They have a television located in the centre of the mirror and heated floors. We had lunch in the bar and it was really good. I had the lamb shank with couscous and my husband had a bunch of their appetizers. Everything was excellent and certainly met expectations. The only critique I would have is that the staff is not very personable, but I was only there one night, so who knows.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA business meeting in this very nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "michaelbyrns", "ReviewID": "UR126099707", "Content": "I understand this is a new hotel.

We were met, by name, and shown to a fabulous 10th floor room with a view of the CN Tower and overlooking the Convention Centre-perfect!. Within 10 minutes of our arrival a generous, and outstanding piece of cheesecake was delivered, with chocolate writing that said \"happy birthdays!\" Following a relaxing afternoon we had dinner in the main diningroom and were given a tour of the kitchen where I will soon be reserving their cooking table for another special occasion I have coming up (dinner was outstanding and dessert-omg!). Sunday morning my daughter and 2 year old joined us for brunch and a fabulous 4-generations swim in the salt water pool. As we were checking out another amazing staffer hurried over with a gift for my granddaughter, and as everyone knows, recognizing someone's grandchildren is so much nicer than being recognized yourself.

We were very impressed with virtually everything about it. Staff were incredible. Not a single issue with anyone. And service was over the top. Just amazing. The location was perfect for downtown Toronto - close to everything from restaurants to shopping to the convention centre to ACC or Skydome. Rooms were very nice, decent size, elegantly appointed. They even had a TV hidden in the mirror in the bathroom. That was very cool. And the bathroom, in general, was very nice. The food at the Ritz was also excellent. As were the 2 different lounges - great spots to have a drink and talk to friends. The pool and the hot tub are free - not sure why another review said the opposite. The steamroom and sauna are part of the spa, and so you'd have to pay for those, but the very nice pool area is free. The fitness area is also free and a good size, with alot of modern equipment. The Golden State Warriors of the NBA were staying there the same weekend, so that should say something. If you've got a bunch of multi-million dollar per year pro athletes staying there - and they can afford to go to any hotel in Toronto - you know the Rtiz is good.

The lobby did resemble an office building but that didn't bother us at all. The view was beautiful but the area is not the best during the winter. Not many places within walking distance to pass the time.

The room was small, the bathroom, while surfaced in marble, is a large square space separated into a very small shower and stall by opaque glass that does not reach the floor or ceiling. The entry from the hall is very narrow and if the closet doors are open the walkway into the room is blocked. The Club Level offerings were meagre, peanuts in the afternoon, a few appetizers at dinnertime. The breakfast, however, was plentiful. The property itself is very comfortable but also very stark. The staff is not nearly as friendly or accommodating as the staff at other Ritz properties we have visited. We asked for early check in at 1:00 and our room was still not ready until 4:00 at which point they switched us to a different room without the view we had originally booked.

First of all the hotel does not come cheap but it is definitively worth the money. This was our first trip to Toronto so it took me quiet a time to browse through all the hotels on Tripadvisor but finally I decided to spend some extra money and enjoy a luxurious hotel. I never regretted it! The hotel itself is brand new and conveniently located on Wellington Street right behind the Metro Toronto Convention Center and the CN-Tower. You will be able to walk to almost all sites in Downtown and the Financial District, but you will need a taxi to get to Bloor/Yorkville. From the moment I entered the lobby I felt right at home. I was greeted by everyone I encountered with my full name minutes after arrival. Luckily I was upgraded to the Club-Level whereas our room was on the 16th floor facing the lake (1615). The rooms are brand new with the usual understated RC luxury. Everything was clean and comfy as expected. We got a room with 2 beds, one for the Master and the other one for my wife and myself. At first I thought about an additional extra bed, but the beds are huge. So sleeping space was no problem. Even with the 2 bed in our room there was enough space for the 3 of us. We never felt cramped. There was sufficient closet space for all of us. The hallway of the room is light marble whereas the living room is lined with carpet. There is a complimentary tea- and coffeemaker in the hallway as well as the fully stocked minibar. The marbled bathroom had ample space, 2 sinks, a separate WC and a separate walk-in shower. The mirror had an embedded TV. The view from the 16th floor was nice but not overwhelming. The only minor negative point about the room was the connecting door. After falling asleep around 20:00 at our first night due to the jet-lag I woke up around 23:00 hearing loud voices and party noise in the other room. After lying awake for 15 minutes I decided to call the front desk. Within minutes security showed up and it turned silent for the rest of our stay. I thought I ha a d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0-vu since this happens to me on most of my long haul trips. I even once accused my neighbor of noise disturbance while staying at The Peninsula Bangkok. Finally I figured out that my wife has left her I pod on the docking station and the music was coming out of the loudspeakers behind our bed. Awkward! What really made our stay special was the extraordinary friendliness as well as the attitude and commitment of the entire Club staff during our visit. Especially I like mention Mr. Hannud from the Club staff who was amazingly friendly. The Club itself is on the 21st floor and we really enjoyed the four times daily food presentations. It started with a sumptuous breakfast followed by snacks for lunch and canap\u00c3\u00a9s before dinner, completed by a dessert buffet just before bedtime. Needless to say that everything was delicious and I gained 2 kg weight. But we literally appreciated the real-value of the hotel and the service commitment of the RC staff just after check-out. We had left Toronto and had already arrived at Niagara-Falls when my wife noticed that she had forgotten all her jewelry in the room-safe. Another d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0-vu since this also happened before while staying at the Mandarin Oriental Boston and had led to some unpleasant surprises. But RC handled everything extremely professional. Within 24 hours (!) the jewelry was returned to us in Niagara-Falls (!) due to the amazing effort of Mr. Krzyztof Mazur from the RC Toronto after driving the complete distance. We are deeply grateful for his service commitment and for sure will never forget this episode as well as Mr. Mazurs effort in our whole life. Always check the room-safe before leaving! Overall we were highly satisfied with our entire stay that was made special though the natural kindliness and the service commitment of the staff as well as the comfy rooms and gorgeous atmosphere. Having stayed in many 5-star hotels around the world including many Mandarin Oriental\u00c2\u00b4s, Four Season\u00c2\u00b4s as well as Peninsula hotels I have to admit that this hotel truly belongs into the same category.

The location of the hotel is somewhat unexceptional and given its (understandable) lack of history, the hotel does not exceed the sum of its parts -- a modern, well designed, downtown luxury chain hotel managed by a professional hotel corporation.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location & great service\u201d", "Author": "ClarkGFVA", "ReviewID": "UR120047624", "Content": "My wife and I celebrated our first anniversary in Toronto (interests were Niagara Falls, Redskins vs Bills game, checking out a new city) and stayed three nights at the Ritz.

And one important detail, it\u00c2\u00b4s a more contemporary and sleek R-C that what we normally experience which was so refreshing! Check-in: Very pleasant, friendly, smooth and quick. All of the Front Desk staff are a joy to deal with Room: We had 1204 which is a corner suite (same room type as last time), overlooking the city. And it just checks every box for me. We unfortunately had to move rooms (smooth process though) and ended up in 2005 which is the same type of room, but overlooking the CN-tower and the water.

But we had ordered burgers rare and they arrived well done. Not so good. * Toca is a wonderful restaurant!!! Nice to look at and the food is fabulous!!! Also, the childrens menu is on an Iphone so after figuring out what the child in question should eat they can entertain themselves with some games. Nice touch :) * The meals on the club level is a quiet and very pleasant experience. And some nice choices despite a small selection. Internet: Fast and wireless, but not free. Too bad. Spa: Very spacious, calm and classy. My therapist was a pleasure to deal with. BUT, had asked for a regular bikiniwax though, and ended up with a French one before i knew it...Very annoying. Little details that make a world of difference: * Our little daughter spotted all the pumpkins down in the lobby (it was Halloweeen after all) and she just loved them and wanted to buy one. The FD staff over heard that and when we got up to the room there was a bag there with a lovely card and a little pumpkin inside. That really made her, and subsequently our, stay super nice!!! So thank you Brooke :) * Also, Tom Brodi the chef of Toca spotted our daughter in the restaurant one night and asked if she wanted to come see something really cool. Of course we all trotted off towards the kitchen where he procedeed to whip up some fresh cotton candy for her. Score!!!

Throughout our two-day stay at the end of September, the most delightful plus was the attitude of the staff, without exception. We were made to feel welcome from our arrival at the front door to our departure. From my point of view, the Hotel is not in the most advantageous spot, but the facility itself is really quite special. The Club Lounge is the best we have seen in any hotel. The ambiance is quietly elegant and the food spectacular and relentless. We were able to enjoy a wonderful lunch within minutes of arriving while the Club Level Concierge looked after the mundane aspects of checking our credit card details. The card was returned to us, complete with room keys, as we nibbled. When we decamped to visit our room, two floors down, the luggage was already in place. The Club-Level Room was more than adequate. The layout was efficient, with the wardrobes and closets, including both a room safe and minibar and the entrance to the bathroom, all being just inside the door, and with the room itself beyond all that necessary clutter. With respect to amenities, all I can say is wow! There was a Blu-ray DVD player (which could handle regular DVDs) attached to a 42 inch TV which was actually connected to a converter that produced a proper 16 X 9 aspect ratio picture. My usual experience in Toronto is a 16 X 9 aspect flat screen TV on which everyone looks short and squat and grainy because they have merely stretched out a 4 X 3 picture onto a 16 X 9 screen. Another pleasant surprise was that the bulbs in the lighting fixtures were sufficient to actually read by. This is not, as a rule, the case in hotels. The room also had a Nespresso Machine (not the usual Dreadful Drip Device), and a BOSE Wave Radio-CD Player, complete with MP3 dock. A touch I have never seen before was a remote control in the Bathroom that allowed you to access TV in the bathroom mirror. Personally, I do not watch TV when away from home in a hotel, but for those who do, this is would likely be a special treat. The bathroom was spacious and had separate areas, with frosted glass doors, for the WC and shower. The first night we ate at the TOCA Restaurant. The TOCA Restaurant is a little awkwardly situated, being right above a sometimes noisy bar called The TOCA Bar, located just inside the entrance to the Hotel. Also, the ambience OF the TOCA Restaurant leaves a bit to be desired, featuring diner-style tables without table cloths. Overall, the impression is a bit cold and sterile. From my point of view, the Cheese Cave was the most intriguing feature of the restaurant. A visit during dinner is recommended. It may influence your decision regarding dessert; it certainly did mine! The meal was more than adequate and they know how to make a straight-up dry gin martini without ice. My wife had the Plat du Jour, which was spaghetti with shaved white truffles. On invitation, the chef himself, Tom Brodi, came to the table and added additional shavings of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153white gold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd until told to stop. I have to add, that he came equipped with an electronic scale on which the additional goody goodness was weighed out, needless to say, at an added cost. I had a taste, and the eventual result was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to die for\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The second night, we ate at DEQ, a bar located at the back of the Hotel, down a few steps. We ate there because, it being Sunday, the TOCA Restaurant was closed. The seating suitable for dining is limited, but luckily for us, it not busy when we arrived ,and the service and food were both creditable. The server even went out of his way to find me the local craft beer that I had enjoyed at TOCA the previous night, one that was not actually on tap at DEQ that night. The Hotel is directly connected to the PATH, an underground maze that allows one to get from the Ritz (which is almost at the Southwest end of the PATH) right up to the Eaton Center (which is almost at the Northeastern end of the PATH). In conditions of inclement weather, this is a major plus. With respect to negatives, they were few and far between. There is a public park across Wellington Street and during the weekend that we were in the Hotel, there was almost non-stop, and very loud live music being played there as part of a festival called Nuits Blanche. We could hear this easily in our room even though the windows do not open. How common such intrusions are I am not sure, but I hope it was an unusual departure from blessed silence. The Nespresso Machine was very nice, but supplying just four capsules, two of them decaffeinated, was a little stingy I thought. We used the two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd capsules on Day 1, and, after the room had been cleaned, on Day 2, they had been replaced with decaffeinated ones. Ouch.

She let me know she saw the request and that they were fully committed last night and didn't have a room ready yet (huge political figure funeral across the street made that pretty obvious, roads blocked, etc). She asked what our plans were for the day, in the mean time, the front desk manager (assume ?) came over with a stuffed Ritz Toronto Moose for my daughter. Aarti and I discussed Buskerfest, festival we came into town for, as well as some other things to do on the way. She said she was sorry and would get a couple housekeepers in a room and rush it, I said no worries, we will be gone for the day. She upgraded me to a city view room, up on 16 I think. What a great view, nice large room. Next day, at checkout, I told her I had left all of my bags in the room and asked to have a bellman run them to my car because we are leaving to sightsee again and will get the car from valet later in the day. She said that she was looking thru the paper and recognized my daughter in a picture. She emailed me the link and said the hotel didn't carry that paper but she was sending a bellman to get one for us. We came for our car that afternoon, all loaded up, DVD player put up and powered on, waters in the car, nice hand written letter from Aarti clipped to the newspaper on my front seat. Awesome service! I have no complaints about the stay. My daughter played in the soaker tub and watched cartoons on the TV built into that bathroom mirror while we took turns showering, it was that relaxing of a stay. I wish I brought her bubbles, we usually don't give her the baths on a 1 night stay. Can't comment on the fitness center or restaurants unfortunately. Room was super clean and well appointed. Shoe horn, tie rack, lint brush, great minibar/martini/snack selection, bose ipod dock, blueray player, nice TV. Aarti, the doorman and valet where on when we can and left and were very spot on about details that we shared. They made us feel that it was at a personal level and they really enjoyed us and our excitement for their city. I have stayed at a number of Ritz Carlton hotels as well as Luxury Boutiques, I understand the level of luxury service and this was above the norm. Thanks to all! I want to start seeing wifi TVs in the new luxury hotels tho.

It was a phenomenal experience all-around. We booked a one bedroom corner suite through our Virtuoso travel agent back when the hotel was not yet open. We were able to get a fantastic rate of 385 CAD a night with the third night free. The Virtuoso benefits provided included: an upgrade to a \"view\" room on a high floor, free breakfast each morning, a welcome amenity (assorted fruit and still/sparkling waters) and a $100 spending credit during the stay. The hotel is brand new and you can smell the newness in the rooms and public areas. Check in was a breeze and we were provided with the correct room with all our requests for high floor, bedding type honored. Everyone was very friendly at the front desk. Check out experience was also uneventful and the bill was accurate in spite of so many moving parts with the free night, Virtuoso benefits, and Gold elite free high speed internet access. The suite was impeccably decorated and have very comfortable. The bed was especially comfortable- the only grievance I have is that the duvet and cover were so heavy that I got a little warm at night even with the temperature at 65 degrees. The rain shower was perfect pressure and temperature wise. The TV in the bathroom mirror is a great touch and something I definitely will look to have at home in the future! Housekeeping service was thorough and toiletries replenished as needed. Turndown service was similarly good with used towels exchanged, drawing of curtains, and bedside waters and chocolates. The Nespresso coffee maker in the living room was a nice touch; you can make your own espresso or regular coffee with one-use capsules. The room is well-stocked on coffee mugs, espresso cups, spoons, all types of glasses (drinking, champagne, wine), and ice bucket (which is filled at turndown). The TV selection was significant and the picture quality was excellent. One pet peeve we have about other hotels is when they spend a lot of money on flat-screen TVs but then don't bother with HD connections, leaving a pretty fuzzy TV picture. Not the case here. Internet access was fast and available either in hard-wired or wireless versions. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for this service as it is complementary for Gold members, but I believe it would have been $9.95 a day, noon to noon. We ate at TOCA by Tom Brodi (breakfast) and DEQ bar (lunch). Both were fantastic. The lunch fare at DEQ bar is limited, but we had some great tasting lunches there. I even ordered a cheeseburger \"off-menu\" and it was no problem at all. I also had a ham, cheese and caramelized onion sandwich that was quite tasty. We also had late-night drinks there with some friends one night and had a great bartender, Chris. TOCA has a good selection for breakfast. I stuck with the continental, which came with some of the best croissants I have ever had. My partner tried the macadamia pancakes, fruit smoothies, and assorted muffins, scones and croissants. We enjoyed everything and the service was attentive and thorough. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is a few blocks from the CN Tower and Metro Toronto Convention Centre. There is a metro stop a few blocks away on University Avenue, so you can get around the city very easily.

Rooms, bedding, and bath are excellent and immaculate. Lobby feels more stylish, intimate, and modern than most Ritz Carltons. Cons- Door closure mechanisms are extremely noisy, especially for a new luxury property. Very miserly with amenities. Overt capitalism diminishes the otherwise excellent hospitality. I did enjoy the Ritz and kudos to the wonderful staff, but there were some shortcomings I found to be out of place. For starters, there were no slippers in the room to wear to the pool, one bar of soap to cart around between the shower, tub, and sink, and a general failure to fully restock toiletries as needed. I'd never found that at other Ritz properties and was surprised. Second, I thought the stated fee of $50 was a bit overboard to use the sauna and steam room, which were fine but certainly not top-of-class. Given the room rates, this fee seemed like a crass money grab. Third, my neighbors awoke me twice well after midnight accepting their room service order and when placing it back in the hallway. Unless people are conscious and considerate, the doors slam loudly and can wreck a night's sleep. At 9:30 am, their leftovers were still outside my door, which is also not something typical for a Ritz. All told, it was good but could have been much better. Maybe they will keep polishing things up a bit before the Shangri La and new Four Seasons open. Location is neither good nor bad in my mind. I do prefer being in Yorkville for leisure, but the hotel is well-suited to those with business in the financial district, as well to King and Queen West. If you like excellent hip casual dining, I really enjoyed Luma, which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel on King West.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding service and a credit to the brand\u201d", "Author": "TouringWillis", "ReviewID": "UR115864300", "Content": "I know you expect the best at ritz Carlton, but have to say this new, more modern example of the brands hotels is the best yet.

I was taken a little aback as a well suited staff member tactfully approached me at the lobby, escorted me to the front desk where another staff member checked me in, said I had automatically been upgraded, and that my room was ready. The staff escort who was explaining the F&B outlets in the lobby area, then collected my bags and took me to my room. I was so surpirsed that the escort (a lady) was also the bell(wo)man! It was a very charming experience. What I also liked was as contemporary and attractive the lobby was, nothing in the hotel felt too grand or sprawling. They have a great restaurant on the mezzanine, a bar in the front, and a wonderful lounge in the rear with a deck overlooking the little park. The hotel has a fabulous spa and pool (although you have to pay $50 per day to use the spa if you aren't there for a treatment) but the pool is free to use for all guests. The spa though is amazing with a hydro jetted pool (there are built in sections you lie on with at least 20 jets underneath). The relaxation room is stunning with double height windows letting in an abundance of light. It's odd that they charge guests to use the facilitles though - that would be my only gripe with the hotel.

I had booked a basic deluxe room at a government rate of $205 for the night plus the $42 for valet parking. What an amazing deal this turned out to be. I'll just describe our stay there from the beginning to give everyone a good picture of what this amazing place is like. We arrived and a valet came and took our name and gave us a card to retrieve the vehicle at the end. This valet took our bags and brought us to the check in desk, as we approached the desk there was an employee there that welcomes us by name. It took a couple of minutes to figure out how they would know our name but the valet had an ear piece so he must be able to communicate to the guy by the front desk and told him our name as were approaching, either way it was a great first impression. The lobby is absolutely gorgeous, looks better in person that in pictures. When we checked in we were told were going to be getting a free upgrade to a corner suite (BONUS), we were also given access to the club lounge on the 20th floor (DOUBLE BONUS). We had to wait a couple of minutes for our room but I expect that was because they were putting the strawberries in there, our bags arrived in our room before we did as well which was awesome. A concierge brought us first up to the 20th floor club lounge and showed us around then he brought us to our room and took time to show features of this amazing room. If you go tip well as this is a very swanky place and they really go out of their way to assist you. The room was amazing, you come in and there is a small 2 piece bathroom right by the front door, then you enter the living room, from the living room is a hallway that goes past the main bathroom and into the bedroom. Everything in this room was top drawer, they didn't spare any expense when they made this hotel. The do not disturb sign was made of leather even just to give you an idea of the quality of things in this place. The bathroom is huge, all marble, heated floor and a TV built into the bathroom mirror. There was also a 42 inch TV in the livingroom and another one in the bedroom. This is the first hotel I've been to that actually had HD programming, most hotel's have the flat screen TV's but nothing in HD, this place had HD which was great. Internet was $9.95, no biggie but thought maybe it would be complimentary at such a high scale hotel such as this. We were here to go see Lion King at 7:30pm and we had reservations at Big Daddy's Oyster Bar for 5:30. We thought we'd go check out the club level lounge before dinner. What a great idea this turned out to be. The lounge was empty so we grabbed a great spot by the window overlooking the CN tower and skydome, exact same view we have from our bedroom in our room 6 floors below. Something I forgot to mention about the club lounge, ALL DRINKS ARE COMPLIMENTARY! Yes thats right, free booze, SCORE!! If that wasn't great enough they started bringing out appetizers. These appetizers were great, they had chicken and potato, red snapper over veggies, pulled pork on toast, some crab salad mixture, cheese's, breads, small caesar drinks, you name it and they had it. All free as well. We started munching away on the appetizers and realized we were not hungry now to have dinner before the show so we just stayed and ate some more. The bed in our room was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on, quality bedding and a feather bed overtop of the king size mattress, I slept like a baby. You can check out on the TV like most other hotels and the valet got our vehicle for us very quick as well. I can't say enough about this place, it's was absolutely amazing, no complaints whatsoever, it was perfect in everyway. You couldn't even hear people in the hallway or in other rooms, extremely quiet and peaceful The location of this hotel could not be better, you are literally 2 minutes walking distance from Princess of Wales and Royal Alexandria theatres. There are a crazy amount of nearby restaurants to enjoy as well, there is no hotel that has a better location then this place. You cannot go wrong by staying at this amazing hotel. Chocolate covered strawberries were free as well. I had emailed back in March when I reserved this room to have some chocolate covered strawberries be there as it's my wife's favourite.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe most luxurious hotel in Toronto\u201d", "Author": "Macbermy", "ReviewID": "UR105108540", "Content": "I stayed in a one bed room suite for my girlfriends birthday.

Location: If you`re in town for business, ie downtown, it`s spot on. Great communications around the corner plus easy walking distance to the big arenas for sports/music events. Room: We stayed in a 1 bedroom corner suite (1614) with a glorious view over the CN-tower plus the water. The room is very large and has a great layout. The colour scheme is harmonious and classy. There was even a screen inset IN the bathroom mirror so that tv could be watched while soaking in the tub. Furniture both good looking and comfortable. Bed very comfortable! It`s alsp surprisingly quiet given its location Food: Excellent! And the waiters are personable yet professional Staff: You`re greeted with a smile from each and everyone of them!

I booked the best room available\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a One Bedroom Corner Suite with Lakeview\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and we headed downtown to check in. Arriving outside, there were two valets attending another car. Despite seeing us pull in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6neither one came over to take our luggage/car for valet parking. No one was in the other car and for some reason both men were fiddling with it rather than one coming to help us. Finally one came and took the keys and we headed inside. That was to be a pre-cursor to the whole experience\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6very friendly people that are just as bit slow on the service side. Check In found the two front desk people attending others so a staff member guided us over to the Concierge desk where we were promptly checked in. I asked for a late check out and received one no problem. She wished me a happy birthday\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6nice touch\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and I asked for a champagne bucket filled with ice to be sent up to the room. Our room was on the 14th floor\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6there are only 200+ rooms total\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and it was very nicely decorated and laid out. You enter into a hall with a small bathroom on the right and then a living area with 42\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd LCD TV\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6small bar area\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6mini fridge with pop/juice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6glasses\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6liquor bottles\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and snacks. A desk with phone and a couch and a floor to ceiling window completes the area. Walking along a hall you have a spacious bathroom on the right with Jacuzzi tub\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6separate shower\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6double sinks and a TV imbedded in the mirror. This was a big plus with my Sweetie but unfortunately ours didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. (More on that later.) Continuing down the hall you find the bedroom with a King bed\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6nice linens\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6another desk and phone and 42\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TV and another floor to ceiling window. We had a Lakeview room but next time I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay the extra $50 as the hotel is so far from the actual lake that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really not worth it. Plus all the ugly condos basically block all but a smidgeon of the view so why bother? Since the bathroom TV didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work we called the Front Desk and no one answered. It took repeated attempts over the course of 10-15 minutes before either the Front Desk or Concierge would pick up. In a hotel with only 200 rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6that was lacking a bit. The technician arrived and checked things out\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6did a few adjustments and said it just needed to load the channels then it would work. Meantime, we were still waiting for our champagne bucket. Again\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6such a small hotel should be a bit quicker with their service. We wanted to leave and do some shopping in Yorkville but had to wait for these delays. The TV\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6after loading the channels\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work so we called down and they offered us another room. Sooooo\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6pack up our bags and move to the 12th floor after asking for the champagne bucket to be rerouted to our new room. Same features just a lower floor and different corner view but at least everything worked. When the bucket came it was a small ice bucket like we already had in the room, not the champagne bucket requested. The waiter apologized and went to get another. By this time we had to leave to get some shopping in so off we went. Upon arriving back the champagne was on ice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6there was a small plate of dried fruit and cheese\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a box of 3 truffles and a birthday card\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6very nice indeed. Unfortunately when I went to make myself a drink I noticed the glass I had brought with me was gone. Now this is a plain, plastic tumbler that I usually bring because A) it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plastic and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break if I have a moment of indiscretion and B) it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s larger than the glasses most hotels provide so you can mix a proper drink with ice etc. in it. I called down to tell the Front Desk it was missing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6picked up by the maid no doubt. My point wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to recover the glass\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which had no value\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but to inform the hotel that the maid shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be removing other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property from the room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6especially when we just checked in. If we had checked out and left the glass behind then fine\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6remove it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but to go into a newly arrived guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room and remove a glass that obviously didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong to the hotel was wrong. Anyway\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6they were very apologetic and actually found the glass and returned it to us. The Concierge called up and said for the broken TV/moving rooms/missing glass problems they wanted to send up some beer(???) I said I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drink beer but a bottle of white wine would be nice. This was sent up with a card apologizing for the mishaps. We ordered Room Service and the sandwich was good and arrived in about 45 minutes. Room Service has various menus\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6breakfast\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6late night etc. and is 24 hours but with a limited selection available after 11pm. There are dvd players for both TVs and pay movies available too. Overall the room was beautiful and the hotel staff all very friendly and accommodating. Service is a touch off\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a little slow and not quite perfectly polished yet\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but the staff makes up for it with a genuine desire to please and really\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for much more than that.

I came away thinking that the Hazelton may still be the best 5 star choice in the city. The positives : 1. It is absolutely spotless and still has that new hotel smell. 2. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable with really nice marble bathroms. Coolest item is the TV in the bathroom mirror. 3. Mostly the staff were very friendly and tried hard to please. 4. The gym/fitness centre was exceptionally well equipped and had a nice looking if somewhat small indoor pool. The less positive things. 1. Lack of wow factor in the rooms. There's nothing wrong with them but just a little utilitarian for my taste and not overly large at about 450 sq. ft. 2. The public areas are equally lacking in wow factor. 3. I was booked under the AmEx Platinum card Fine Hotels programme, despite the fact that the hotel was pretty empty I did not get the room upgrade that I was entitled to under the programme and when I asked for the upgrade the clerk who was checking me in told me the my city view deluxe was an upgrade when actually it is the lowest level room in the hotel. There was availability in every room and suite category according the website. 4. 3 small quibbles : the door of my room did not close properly. The towel basket in the gym was overflowing with used towels even though there were no guests in the gym at 7am. it can't have been cleaned at least since the previous evening given the low usage of the facility. Also they charge $10 per day for internet, if Motel 6 can throw it in when they charge $30 per night can't the Ritz-Carlton do the same at $450 per night? Overall this new Ritz-Carlton is well appointed, well located, spotless and comfortable and a decent choice for travellers on an expense account.

The bathroom with the heated floor, big shower, double sinks was fantastic and I really liked the Blue Vision TV in the mirror. The hotel provided complimentary drinks and snack for a welcome gift because my husband had told them it was my birthday and there was a turn down service which was a nice touch. The breakfast in TOCA was good although the coffee was weak. We had dinner at TOCA as well and it was good but not great. And we had a snack and some drinks at the TOCA bar which was very good. The service over all was good not great because they still seemed to be learning. It was nothing of great concern but you could see there were still a few kinks to be worked out.
