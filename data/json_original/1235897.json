The sheets on the bed were meticulously pressed and the bed itself was a cloud from heaven above. Bathroom was HUGE with double sink, big soaking tub and shower stall. The toiletries were spa quality and smelled amazing. I wanted to take a bottle home! Junior Suite room was outfitted with a small kitchenette and Illy espresso machine. Best mini bar selection I've ever seen. Club 50 at the roof top was hopping and happening. The pool was like being at a resort/beach all wrapped in one.

We were due to stay two nights but after receiving such poor, and rude, service we checked out early and instead stayed at the Mandarin Oriental on Saturday - which was fabulous. At the request of the front desk manager, I lodged a complaint with the hotel's security team related to an allergic reaction that I believe was caused by MSG or another flavour additive in the room service food on Friday night (tagliatelle bolognese). My issue was not so much with the allergic reaction - it happens, but more with the way I was spoken to and made to feel. I was told someone would call or email me to let me know the outcome of the 'investigation' and whether it was in fact the food that caused my reaction, as suspected, I have not heard anything in response.

First of all, the layout on\u00a0the hotel's\u00a0website misleads the guests. My wife did the wedding preparation there and she had the makeup artist, stylist and photographers there also. We were counting that there will be a 1/2 bath in the \"one bedroom suite\", but this was non existent in room 2001. That was the main reason we specifically booked a \"one bedroom suite\", because it\u00a0had 2 bathrooms making it\u00a0very uncomfortable to share\u00a0it. She ordered food that took 50 minutes to get to the room! however, the food was really good. The mini bar is on the hotel's website but was also non existent in that room. The valet parking took 25 minutes to bring the car and they were very rude, except for the cashier who was the only one helpful! My wife was late for the ceremony thanks to the terrible valet service. The room was nothing impressive, the \"blackouts\" were cheap plastic curtains and did not cover at all. We had to leave in a hurry from that room because we couldn't sleep well. There were not enough towels in the room, and in the morning we had to order extra towels. Also, there were no bathrobes, and on the website clearly says \"Sferra linens and robes custom designed by Kelly Wearstler\" On the hotel's website it says \"One-Bedroom Suites offer modern sophistication accented by a timeless East Asian sensibility.\" but the decor was horrible (IKEA like), not Asian at all! The view was partial ocean view and we booked a\u00a0\"One Bedroom Water View Suite\" We\u00a0live on Brickell and that \"one bedroom suite\" we stayed at The Viceroy\u00a0ws a cheap imitation from the apartment we live in, so we should have stayed at our place instead of paying $540 per night for a mediocre room and service. When we checked out the valet, of course, took about 30 minutes to bring our car and we were at the lobby waiting for that long. \u00a0This was our first time at the Viceroy hotel and we were wrong for choosing this hotel for our wedding night!

The front desk, guest services, and spa staff were extremely friendly and responsive. The pool is enormous and makes a good swim easy. On the other hand, the design of the pool deck requires you to move a few times to stay in the sun and we were admonished for putting our feet in a very shallow cool water pool because it was evidently just for show. We had also hoped to enjoy a relaxing few minutes in the really large and comfortable hot tub after dinner one evening but were disappointed that we could not do so because the pool closes at 6 pm. We also asked to borrow a few pool towels for our day on the beach and were told by the pool staff person that use was limited to the pool only. Other things created small annoyances. The valet parking is poorly designed. There is one driveway for the hotel, the residences and Club 50 and we were frequently backed up waiting for space to clear to drive to the curb. At times, we could not get in and cars exiting the garage could not get out. Also, water and flooring don't work well together here. The pool deck is lined with rows of stone that are very slippery when wet, and the shower floors in both the rooms and the spa are made of marble. They too became slippery. Finally, the spa, while well equipped, has a work out room that is not well-ventilated. The large windows afford a great view, but they let in a lot of sun and it gets hot pretty quickly. I raise these small points because if we are paying $400 a night for a room, we expect the little things to work as well as the big things.

NOT IN MIAMI. I had communicated numerous times with the hotel prior to arriving as we were celebrating our 10th anniversary and we also had our 9 year old son with us. We booked a one bedroom suite, which we were assured had a pull-out in the living room and was designed to accomodate at least three people. We were assigned a \"Client Associate\" who e-mailed us various times prior to arrival to ensure that she got all our requests correct. We arrived at the property at 7am to no room. The valet \"lost\" our car. After about 30 minutes it was \"found.\" We were told there was a 24/7 outdoor restaurant at the pool-- not so. We returned late that night, with our jet-lagged son, ready to fall into bed. We had been promised that his pull out would have been made up by the time we got back. Near midnight, there was no bed made. I tried to open the couch and to my dismay found that the couch had no pull-out! I called down to get a cot and was assured he would be up in minutes. When the non-English speaking Haitian (or possibly African) bellman arrived he smiled with a pile of sheets in his arms and said )Now make-up?\" I told him there was no bed. \"Make bed now?\" \"No we need a bed.\" \"Sheets?\" \"No.\" \"Towels then?\" \"OK give me the towels and please take the sheets.\" I closed the door. For two sleepless nights the same thing went on. Our son had to sleep with us in our bed. I will say that the sheets and bedding were terrific and comfortable. But that's about it.

The view out to the city was not that great as the buildings across the street are under construction so we felt especially fortunate to have the corner. The bathroom was the size of a bedroom with a wall of windows and mirrors. All marble, great shower, great bathtub and more space than you could possibly need. We used the spa and it was very nice. It has an amazing 2 or 3 story wall of glass that overlooks the water. Check-in is on a cross walk overlooking the windows and the spa area below. The only downside to is that the fitness center is located on the other side of the desk to check in. As you sit in the spa's below after your massage you will be viewed by those coming and going from the gym. I'm uncertain why they arranged the spa this way. The last thing I want to see after a massage and sitting in spa are people going to and coming from working out. Other than that it was great and the massage itself is worth it. The pool is really something special. On the 15th floor of the hotel surrounded by three 50 story buildings. The pool deck opens up to the water and Fisher Island and standing at the far end gives you a sense of awe.

Want to also mention that viceroy is a very small hotel for guests. it has loads of apartments with it and that is mainly what it consists of so..... no facilities and of course everyone is by pool.

Yes, its not on the beach, but you can easily take a cab there or drive, if you're renting. The decor is very art deco, and so beautiful. The rooms are very spacious and you dont really feel like you are staying at a hotel, more like renting a luxury apartment (if you get the suit). The staff was very kind and helpful and I thought it was very courteous to inform us with a letter brought over thru the evening turndown that the miami marathon was happening the next day and the possibiltiy of traffic. They also offered to help with travel needs. The pools are on the roof of the 15th floor, and wow what a view. It felt like you were on the ground floor until you realize that you are floating between buildings. The restaurant EOS was beautiful and serviced some delicious fare. And the spa... The most unique Ive seen for sure! So beautiful and relaxing. I didnt get any services, however because checkout was at noon and they were fully commited, we werent flying out until evening, we were told that we could use the pool, gym and spa facilities. The waiting room was like no other, chaise lounges, sofas, jacuzies, apples and water all with a great view of the port and ocean.

If you keep your eyes open you can get steeply discounted rates, which make the stay a more affordable. We checked in late, but had called ahead to let them know we wouldn't be checking in until 9.

We asked to be moved on our second night to a regular room. It was well decorated and warm with a small balcony. My biggest issue with both rooms was the bathroom situation. In the suite, it was off of the bedroom, but the walls were paper thin which made it embarrassing to use. In the regular room the bathroom was \"open\" AKA there was no wall separating the bed from the shower and the shower had a see-through door. If you are staying alone no big deal, but if you are sharing a room with anybody other than a person who you want to share your most intimate bathroom moments with beware.

Lots of nice views of the yachts docking at the Epic. The service was very good.

We also enjoyed the small kitchenette area with the espresso machine. Our neighbors down the hall were dancing with Mary Jane the entire time we were there, which was interesting. The smell was never particularly bothersome unless the door to our room was opened. I did find it interesting that the hotel seemed to be trying to cover it up with perfume sprays in the hallway, and some sort of air purifying device. Funny they didn't just knock on the door and tell them it was a \"non-smoking (weed, too) room\", ha?! I did find myself looking out our large balcony at the Epic across the water wishing we had stayed there. The views and pool deck from the Epic looked to be better than the Viceroy's. The 15th floor pool at the Viceroy is very impressive, but doesn't get a lot of sun in January and is a little crowded out by the residents of the buildings the Viceroy shares the Icon Brickell property with. Overall, the rooms are some of the nicest we've stayed in. The service was top-notch, as was the in-room food. I was just a little disappointed with the location.

Wife and I just spent our Anniversary at the Viceroy. Loved the experience. We're not normally Downtown types, in the past its always been South Beach for us since we generally like the Beach, however the Brickell area is crazy nice. Everything is new and the nightlife active. Ton's of nice restaurants with 2 blocks. I occasionally read complaints concerning the Viceroy's room lighting or Espresso maker being hard to operate, or the Spa and Gym being hard to find. Or, that the Hotel is not on the beach. Do people not have a brain? Can they not pre-plan and or look at Hotel information on the internet prior to booking? Can they not view a map for location? We had no concerns with anything facility related at The Viceroy. Our 1 bedroom suite was by far the nicest room we have ever vacationed in, and we've been to some nice places over the years. The wife was in constant awe during our entire stay. Our bathroom was huge with marble everywhere. The room lighting wonderful, two flat screen TV,'s, dinning area, huge balcony, amazing! The Spa was by far the nicest one we're experienced. Amazing, with amazing service! Same for the Fitness area. Whats really nice about The Viceroy is, that fellow travelers and condo owners here are Pretty People. At least far more impressinve that Joe Public. The wife and I sat around the Pool and common areas making note of this daily. The River and Bay views alone are worth the trip when staying here, whether it be from the 16th floor Pool Deck or from a northern facing rooms balcony. The only downsides to The Viceroy Miami could be traffic noise from Brickell Ave.if you have a Westward facing Room, especially on a lower floor. Also the fact that Valet Only Parking cost you $34 per day. The Hotels Club 50 on the other hand is way over-rated. Yes the views are worth the elevator ride, but this place is totally worn-out and trashed. Hopefully it will soon be renivated. The patrons here at night are all younger than 22, so if your over 30 you will feel out of place.

The pool was huge and had amazing views, the restaurants were efficient if not culinary masterpieces and while I did not have a treatment at the spa the space is amazingly well designed. The theater room is a true trip I wish I had time to experience and the spin studio looked great.

They promised me they'll have it available, and since i gave them such advance notice it shouldn't be a problem. I followed up my call/request a few times and up to a day before i flew there. When i got there, they did not honor my request, nor any attempt to apologize or accomodate me, just a simple \"it wasn't available\", and i was given a room with a non impressive, loud street view. The decor is outdated and tacky, the room is so dark even with all the lights on. The hotel is in the end of nowhere, i didn't see any pedestrians walking around. While checking out, they could not locate my car, i was running late to catch my plane but was left waiting outside for my car for 30 minutes the front desk person did not seem to care, I had to keep going back in and asking, so that he'll get up and do something about it. The only upside is the rooftop pool, which due to the monsoon that hit, i couldn't even enjoy. I was just so fed up with everything, and happy to leave. I don't have a problem treating myself and putting down money for quality, But this was pathetic and disappointing.

The rooms are reasonably well-appointed. The location is central, although not too close to the beach. The pool is nice.

We went to this hotel expecting an upscale experience and good service similar to luxury hotels we've stayed in elsewhere. The biggest disappointments were the service and the food and the first sign was the young ladies checking us in. Both were perfectly nice and even willing to help, they just seemed like they'd either had too much to drink or were seriously dysfunctional. Packages went missing. Bellmen didn't talk to concierges. The valet parking guys didn't speak English and definitely did not talk to the girls at the front desk. Nobody could find our car. Nobody knew whether or not we had received the package we'd had mailed to the hotel. All service (room service, laundry, housekeeping, etc) was universally poor and slow. The food was also quite atrocious: rubber omelettes, odd-tasting juice, cold bacon, etc, and they charged us for the wrong meals and brought us menu items we didn't order. In the end, it was a poor experience. I can see that this hotel might work if you're a 25-year old kid who wants to go clubbing. The club downstairs looked pretty happening, although we didn't go. As mentioned, the location is quite central. So I guess I would recommend this hotel if you are a college kid - or a sailor (but only a very forgiving sailor who likes clubbing).", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful property with a horrible staff\u201d", "Author": "Imolarede46", "ReviewID": "UR118361823", "Content": "I found a great rate on hotwire, booked a 5 night trip.

So complicated that it warrants its own instruction programme on the tv. Other than this the room was great with a large balcony - although no furniture to sit on the balcony, you have to drag a heavy room chair out there. Other things I found a little strange about this hotel was there being no sign of a decent guide to the property in the room, ie main pool opening times, where things ( eg gym ) are, how to get to the 50th floor pool, food and drink services. For example we had to go to the 15th floor restaurant to ask them if there was a bar, to be told there was one, escorted us into the restaurant to the bar but then told us they didn't do service to the outside area. No problem , we bought and carried our own drinks there ( its about 20 feet away). Still got the 18% service charge added though. So if you want a casual drink outside at night, it's made quite hard. On the positive side, the pool area is spectacular, massive, laid out excellently, great views and superb pools. Also the location is excellent for everything downtown.

The hotel is located in the Brickell neighborhood of Miami, adjacent to downtown. South Beach is about a 15-minute drive away, but the hotel does front the water- the Miami River and Biscayne Bay- and our room had a wonderful water view. We stayed in a 1-bedroom suite that was HUGE, with a very cool and modern decor, and had 1.5 bathrooms (very large master with tub plus a powder room off the living room), a dining area (complete with dining table) and small kitchenette (microwave, mini ridge, electric stovetop). The room was very comfortable and well appointed, and also had a lovely balcony with the aforementioned water views. The service was excellent, and the hotel staff was friendly and attentive, exactly what I would expect from a higher end hotel such as the Viceroy. What set this hotel apart was the stunning pool complex- there is an Olympic-lenth pool adjacent to two smaller wading pools on the 15th floor of the hotel. The pools themselves seem to strech on forever, but there is also ample \"deck\" space with dozens of lounge chairs, covered and non-covered cabanas and other seating arrangements for lounging/sunbathing purposes. The view from the 15th floor pooldeck is also stunning, and I was really impressed that the hotel would give so much space and thought to the design of the pool complex. The spa is also impressive, although I did not use it. I was a bit hesitant about the Brickell location of the hotel, since it is not on the beach, but found that I didn't miss the beach at all. The fact that there are so many water views from the hotel itself, and the fact that South Beach is just a short drive away more than made up for it. Also, the Brickell neighborhood is trendy (a nice club, Bar 50, is located on the 50th floor of the hotel) and it was a fun place to stay, away from the typical throngs of beachgoers you have to deal with when staying on the beach.

A bit of a walk but worth it in the end. Went to the pool the next day and was there all day. The drinks are pricey but expected in that area, food was also not bad. The pool was great, it over looked the city not to mention being up on the 15th floor was nice. The room was also a plus, nothing to complain about except that it needed more lighting it was very dim in the bathroom & bedroom also adding some chairs outside on the balcony would be nice.

I have one small complaint, although it was big to me at the time: We pulled up to be valeted after a long night at an event, at about 4am (just wanting to fall down into bed and sleep) and we had to wait 20 minutes for a valet to even show up. Once they did, they were talking to people who were hanging out outside, rather than getting our car (the only ones waiting!) I went inside to inform the desk and they said \"they must be busy getting other cars\" and I said \"no, they're socializing, now that they're back!\" I was not at all happy, we had to pay 30 dollars for it each time, it is not as if the service is free.

After taking a red-eye flight we arrived at the hotel at 9am and amazingly our room was ready for us when we got there. Nothing is better then being able to lie down on a bed after a red-eye and the Viceroy made our dreams come true. The stay just kept getting better. Everyone we encountered from the front desk staff to the guest relations staff to the waiters and even the valet went above and beyond. By time we left we felt like we had made a whole new set of friends. This ultimately made the Viceroy stand apart from all others I've stayed at in the past. The front desk staff continually gave excellent recommendations on where to go around the hotel. The waitresses at the poolside cafe would greet us by name every day and couldn't have made us feel more welcome. On Saturday night, where the line for the rooftop club wraps around the building, the valet personally walked us past the line and introduced us to the doorman as hotel guests and made sure we got right in. The person that blew us away was an amazing woman named Christine who was the Guest Recognition Coordinator. She called our room just to check on us and when I inquired about possibly moving to a room that wasn't facing the street she said she would look into it and get back to me. I didn't think that there would be anything she could do since this is a hotel located in a very busy part of the city and I wasn't really expecting anything. To my surprise she said that she would be able to move us the next day. My jaw dropped when she opened the door to our new room and informed us that she had moved us to a river facing one bedroom suite. The trip would have been amazing even with our original room, but this was unbelievable. Christine even made sure that she came out to meet us when we checked out and just wanted to make sure that everything during our stay was up to their high standards.

Upon arriving I was informed that the charge would be $150.00 a night for the deposit (totalling $600 for our stay). At the front desk I was working with Nicole ( who handled the situation great), and she spoke to the manager and we all came to an agreement about the deposit that satisfied both parties. So I have to give the manager and Nicole an A+ for the way that they handled the situation. They also were adamant about finding out who I spoke to when I called because they wanted to make sure this did not happen again but I was not sure because I had called a month prior to arriving. Outside of the hotel there are pillars that look like the stone heads of Easter Island. We stayed in a King Deluxe room which was amazing. The decor of this room is beautiful.

The marble bathroom has to be seen. Words just do not do it justice. Hot separate shower and tub. Double vanity sink. My partner kept saying she needs a bathroom like that at home. There was a balcony also. The bed itself was nice and if you like soft pillows these were like melting marshmellows. The infinity pool is on the 15th floor and the decor out there is nice as well. There are three pools, one we were not able to get in but the second one is heateed and I spent most of my time swimming in that one. One of the days there it was very windy on the roof and the heated pool was perfect. Also there is an amazing view from the roof top. We went up to the 50th level and they had a club in there with a small pool inside the building surrounded by lounge chairs and a bar. That was nice.

The fitness room was clean and offers an incredible view of the surrounding condominiums, hotels and water. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed each of these areas. Overall, the staff was warm, friendly and welcoming. My wife and I rented a junior suite and it was adequate, but a lot smaller than I expected. The sized of the expensive junior suite was the same size of a single room (non suite) in many of the other hotels that we have stayed at. The pictures on the hotel's website are very deceiving. Part of the building that the Viceroy is in consists of condominiums and it seems look the hotel part of the building may have been an afterthought. The lobby is tiny and it was particularly noticeable that the two featured, pink designer end chairs surrounding the coach were filthy and need to be replaced or cleaned. Also, although the hotel had a few modern artistic pieces shattered throughout the space, the decor seemed a bit outdated. For example, the carpet in the hotel room hallways was clean but had dark brown, diamond shapes with a yellowish-tan color in-between the diamond shapes. In my opinion, it looked really outdated. Additionally, there was thick, dark brown, old school wood lattice in the rooms, that was clean, but looked out of date and bulky. The club on the 50th floor also had outdated decor. Overall, we enjoyed the hotel, it was clean, we felt safe and the staff was nice. The only service problem that I experienced was an hour wait for a simple, but expensive continental breakfast consisting mostly of beard (no fruit for $39). Also, friends of ours that stayed in the hotel during the same time, experienced a repeating problem with the shower not working and they felt that the hotel should have offered another room, but did not. As I said in the beginning, we enjoyed the spa and spa areas and I would stay again only if the hotel offered a reduced price or some kind of package deal, that included a spa treatment.

There are (2) Restaurants & (1) bar located on the premises. The Icon is accessible from the pool deck and offers you a variety of gourmet salads, cold & hot pressed sandwiches. Although the food was acceptable at the EOS Restaurant; we were not impressed with the service. We had spent (4) nights at this Hotel but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize until the third day that this complex includes an 18% gratuity charge . . . it would have been appreciated if the staff would have mention that policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c verify your bills. This Hotel is NOT located on South Beach, but its fabulous massive Pool deck & 28,000 square foot Spa will offer you a different experience of Miami. Enjoy an illy espresso without leaving your room!

Even though you are downtown, the hotel still offers a resort experience from the pool area, the gym, and the high quality restaurants in walking distance. Personally, I think staying at the Viceroy offers a better all around Miami holiday than on South Beach or at a more standard resort experience (for example, Ritz Carlton Key Bisacayne). You do need to drive to the beach but is is not far either in Key Biscayne or Miami Beach. Most of all, the staff were wonderful the entire time of our stay including in-house reservations.

Like others, we also liked the d\u00c3\u00a9cor and the marble finish in the rooms. The staff at the front desk were attentive and helpful, when something went wrong (the latch on the door when we arrived) it was fixed straight away and the hotel kindly gave us a complementary bottle of honeymoon champagne and chocolate covered strawberries on arrival. They were very helpful giving directions on places to go and in renting a car. We also had the $15 breakfast on the last morning which was very filling with a good selection As a tourist, the main problem with the Viceroy was the location - Downtown is just in the middle of nowhere. Good for the Cuban sector or perhaps if you have business nearby, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about it. Nowhere near South Beach. On our way back through Miami 10 days later we stayed in Coconut Grove, which had a nice, neighbourly feel. If we ever return to Miami we will stay either in Coconut Grove or closer to South Beach. We also concur with the Bar 50 comments of an earlier traveller - $17 for a so-so cocktail in a plastic glass is a bit over the top (bad), and it was a bit of a hassle to get inside in the first place (free entry if you are staying there but we went to the front of the queue then they said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No armband so you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (bad) so we walked away, but the porter saw what happened, apologised and put us back at the front of the line (good) but when we got upstairs all of the lounge spots were reserved (bad), but we were allowed to sit in them for a drink \u00e2\u20ac\u0153until the others come\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (good but awkward) which was nice but made you feel like an intruder. It all felt a bit cliquey. Also, when we returned the rental car at the end of the day, there was no place nearby to park it so we had to valet park it under the hotel at the full valet parking rate. Cheap car rental which was good but a discount on the parking seeing as we got it through the hotel would have been nice. All up it was a nice place in a nowhere location with good service, but you just got the sense that things were a little mixed up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like that it was a cross between high class apartments, a nightclub and a hotel and was unsure which was most important.

Between their website, and Trip Advisor reviews, the bar was set pretty high. I arrived early, around 11:00 AM which I knew was not check in time. My room was not ready which was obviously fine, so they took my bags and said they would call me when the room was ready. I took a walk around Brickell Key and then Brickell. About two hours later the room was ready. The location of Viceroy is really great. I was there without a car and it is in a very walkable area, as well as an area with easy access to both Metromover (an elevated shuttle system) and Metrorail (a heavy rail system giving you access to South MIami, UM, Coral Gables, Dadeland, Coconut Grove and more) Upon getting my room keys and going up, I have to say I was very impressed with the decor. The halls (very warm, I'm not sure the A/C was on) were very chic and the room was as well. I had asked for a high floor room and was placed two floors above the lobby (i.e.- not a high floor) The room was pretty when I entered; however, the defects were very obvious (note photos.) There was a large crack in the ceiling, there were crumbs on the bench in front of the bed and it was missing several buttons as well. There were markings from construction both behind the bed and in the shower... it looked like graffiti almost. The carpet was stained in two places and one of the chairs had black staining on it as well. One of the recessed lights was falling out of the ceiling and it (the bulb) would go on and off on its own. The shower head was very flimsy and felt like it was going to break when I had to adjust the head. The glass covers are reused which I don't find to be very sanitary. Some people drink out of a cup then put the cover back on. One in the bathroom was dirty with all sorts of marks on it. It looked to be used a lot, but I thought maybe it was just at the bottom of a stack and something happened to it. I decided I would place a small mark on the inside of the two I had taken off the glass I used... the next day when housekeeping had left and replaced the glass I looked and sure enough they were the same covers. The room is very open with the bathroom. They should really put a curtain people can close between the bedroom and bathroom. Just because two people might share a bed does not mean they would want to see each other in the shower. Personally I come to South Florida during the winter to in part, enjoy the weather. I found it strange there was no balcony furniture at all. I do like leaving the balcony door open while I'm in the room to get fresh air, unfortunately this was ruined by a smoker in another room. The scent would waft down in my room and by the time I got a whiff of it, it had already got in the room and I had to deal with that until it dissipated. The pool was closed early afternoon one night of my stay until 12:30 PM the next day. There came a note from the manager... at about 8 PM or so that night. A little late, in my opinion. The pool is closed from sundown until sunrise, which was very ambiguous. A set time depending on the season would work better. To be honest, I'm not sure why the pool closes at all. There were private functions going on all over the place which was fine, but since many occurred in public areas of the hotel it felt awkward going by them when they were going on. The spa pools were nice but the marble floors get very slippery. Thank goodness they stay open until 9 and 10 PM at night since the pool closes early. Cafe Icon I only stopped in to get coffee. It seemed only one girl was really working, the other two were just sort of standing around. I'm not sure of her name, but the hard worker was the one with glasses. Staff didn't remember my name. Lower level staff members (housekeeping, valet workers, etc.) seemed to be more friendly than \"the suits.\" The suits would walk by, ask how you were and then not even stick around for the answer. I don't expect a long conversation, but at least stop, look me in the face, smile and pretend you actually care. I wasn't asked how my stay was going until check out. I came up to the W Fort Lauderdale and the difference has been like night and day. Staff at the W are always smiling, asking how your stay is going, asking if they can get you anything, etc. I will review them later. Overall, Viceroy aspires to be a 5 star hotel, but it's just hitting the 3.75 mark (I wouldn't say it's only 3.5, but it's not 4, so I met in the middle) Will I stay again? It depends on the rate. I didn't pay top dollar, but I certainly didn't get a great deal, either. It's not a bad place, it's not a great place, it's simply a mediocre place; a Hampton Inn with upgrade decor, and no free breakfast or parking. One highlight of the trip was an employee by the name Jose at the front desk. I originally encountered him when he brought my bags up to the room. I made a note that he was very friendly then. As the stay progressed he was the one person that did say hi and would look you in the face. Upon departure I had some rental car problems and he was right there to assist with looking up other location numbers and trying to get them on the phone. I'm not sure Jose's position at Viceroy, but he certainly should be in a senior position.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice pool and location, expensive drinks, poor service\u201d", "Author": "TracyRegnery", "ReviewID": "UR99944844", "Content": "Overall it was a nice stay.

As a local who lives in Miami, I signed up for a Signature Treatment at the Spa and was excited to check out the other facilities and use the Spa for the day. As others have mentioned, the Spa is beautiful. Just walking into the lobby inspires feelings of awe. I arrived early for my appointment and was able to take advantage of one of the fitness classes. The class was very enjoyable and the instructor was great. After a quick shower in the beautiful locker room, I was all set for my treatment. The treatment was great and very relaxing, except for a few issues (see below). After the treatment, I was able to use the outdoor pool, indoor jacuzzis and sauna. I ended up spending most of the day at the spa and really enjoyed the experience. A couple of areas for improvement: - I checked in for my treatment/massage 10 minutes early and was told to wait for my masseuse. I waited in the designated area...and waited...and waited. She didn't arrive until 25 minutes later (which was now 15 minutes after my scheduled appointment). She showed me to the treatment room and started what was supposed to be a 90 minute treatment. There were no visible clocks in the treatment room, so it wasn't until I got back to the locker room that I realized she had only done 75 minutes. This was frustrating for me, as clearly I had checked in early and she was 15 minutes late. By the time I realized that I had been jipped out of 15 minutes of my treatment, it was kindof too late to say anything, so I just dropped it. But if I'm paying essentially $2 per minute for a high-end spa treatment, I expect to receive the treatment for the alloted time period and it shouldn't be my responsibility to chase down the therapist if she ends the treatment early. - The other facilities at the spa are very nice, but out of the steam room, sauna and 3 indoor jacuzzis - the steam room and one of the jacuzzis were out of order. I'm not sure how long they had been broken, but it looked like they hadn't worked for a while (as there were permanent signs on them saying they were broken). Again, for a high end spa to have 2 out of 5 features broken is really unacceptable.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cThe pool takes the cake\u201d", "Author": "ameyls", "ReviewID": "UR97778507", "Content": "I stayed at the Viceroy for a long weekend with my husband and our three year old son. We got a corporate rate that made the one bedroom suite ultra-affordable. We were initially worried about bringing a three year old to such a \"hip\" hotel, but it ended up being a great place for the three of us. Room: We had a one-bedroom suite, which offered plenty of space for the three of us. The furniture was interesting, and we loved the little kitchenette. There were some odd things, though. As another reviewer said, there is just too much furniture in the room. They could take out at least 25% of it and still have a stylish, albeit more spacious, room. Strangely, though, there was absolutely no furniture on the expansive balcony! The room is also divided in a bizarre way that makes for two very long, narrow rooms, instead of a more open layout. That said, we still enjoyed it and found it to be good for our needs. Pool: Wow! We were initially bummed not to be on the beach, but even if the beach had been nearby, I think I still would have spent all of my time at the pool. We were there in January, and the middle pool was heated to about 85 degrees! I just melted right into it. And service by the pool is spectacular--complimentary citrus water, plenty of towels, and cafe service for other needs. My son didn't care that there weren't any fancy slides or \"kid\" things at the pool--he was happy to splash around in the warm water and luscious sunshine. Service: We found the service to be delightful, though not without its ups and downs. On our second day there, the valet service lost our rental car! We had planned to spend the morning on south beach. Instead, we spent over an hour trying to straighten out the situation with the valet. When they still hadn't been able to locate our car, the hotel manager put us into a cab and sent us to the beach on the hotel's dime. I was still very stressed out, though, and found it hard to enjoy the beach until we finally got a call from the hotel saying they had found our car. When we got back to the hotel that afternoon, the manager treated us to a very nice lunch at the hotel's restaurant, and he also comped two days worth of valet parking for us. When we got back to our room that evening, he had also sent up a fruit plate and bottled water, along with a personal note again expressing how sorry he was. I felt they more than made up for our difficult experience. Location: So, it's not on the beach, but downtown has it's charms, and there are some great restaurants nearby.

The front desk workers were friendly, but no one helped us to our room or even showed us which bank of elevators to select, and given the confusing, counter intuitive lobby, we ended up at the wrong set of elevators for a different tower (no signage at all).

As a resident of one of the Caribbean islands, we chose to come to Miami in order to give birth to our second child in the US hospital system. We arrived at 37 weeks of gestation and enjoyed the Viceroy until my son arrived 4 weeks later. Firstly the room was amazing! Easily the best hotel room I have ever stayed in. I believe it was a junior suite on the 42nd floor with magnificent views of Biscayne Bay. Everything was spacious, clean and very well decorated and finished. I will not gush too much about the room itself as almost every other review has already done so, but please don't mistake brevity for dlack of satisfaction in any way. The room was fantastic. The amenities seemed second to none for me. Once again, the other reviews make it clear that the pool area is staggering. The gym was one of the better hotel gyms I have seen and the spa area an excellent touch. I think if anyone has any complaints about these then they are really hard to please. As for location, it was extremely easy to get on and off the I-95 and there was no tricky downtown driving to be done. We hadn't been to this area of Miami before and Brickell Village was a nice surprise to us. It is also a 10 minute walk (if that) to the Bayside park and shopping centre. We rarely felt at a loose end for things to do with our 2 year old either at the hotel, within walking distance or within a short drive. Most importantly however, the service was literally the best we have experienced in the United States. Professional and always friendly. The front desk staff went out of their way to help me fax and email certain business documents and for that I think them. Having been there for a month we felt like we had struck up friendships of sorts with various of the valets (who were always reliable for a friendly greeting and farewell), housekeepers and concierges. Most were so excited for us when our new son finally arrived - when my wife came out of hospital, we almost felt like we were bringing hih \"home\" to family.

The rooms have a small kitchen area with fridge and espresso machine. Excellent and fast & free wifi, and large flat screen TVs with numerous HD channels. All rooms have balconies that overlook Brickell Ave., the Miami River and/or Biscayne Bay. The pool deck is stunning. It is on the 15th floor overlooking Biscayne Bay.

Since the Viceroy is not part of a mega-chain (such as Hilton or Marriot) there is currently no \"rewards program\", so you won't be building your points here. But my opinion is that I'd rather have a unique and lovely experience than accumulate a tons of points that can only be used at cookie-cutter chains.

The suite is very spacious with a long hall, 1/2 bathroom, mini kitchenette, living / dining room, large balcony and a large bedroom with a master bath. I think the most impressive part of the suite is the bathroom with a large tub, shower and a separate toilet. Of course there are two 42 inch flatscreen tv's and since there in different rooms we could watch different tv programs without disturbing each other. The breakfast was great with a ditto service. There is no better start of the day then having breakfast on the 15th floor in the morning sun. The pool area is impressive! The large infinity pool gives you the idea that you are really on top of the world. Unfortunately we didn't have the chance to take a dip due to our busy (shopping) schedule.

The room was beautiful and the stay could have been wonderful, if the following issues are resolved: (1) The room was beautiful but overcrowded with furniture. This was evident when I bumped into a chair positioned next to the \"workstation area.\" The chair and bed stand combined to create a narrow strait that one has to navigate going from the living area to the bathroom and hallway kitchen/closet area. Get rid of half of the furniture and free up the room. (2) Bathroom lacks privacy curtain. Tinted windows and thin see-through bamboo curtains in the bathroom is not enough to prevent being viewed from the outside, especially at night when one can clearly see into the room from street level. The living area has ceiling to floor privacy curtain all around but the bathroom does not. This was a major problem for me during my stay, causing me to turn the hot water full until the entire bathroom window fogged up before bathing. (3) Large 'community' sized liquid soap squirt bottles. The shower body soap and shampoo were evidently used. For the price of the room, does one really have to call and ask for new bottles? At least they replaced the used bottles promptly. (4) No electric plug by bed. Individual LED reading lights by the bed is nice but there is no electric socket by the bed to plug in a laptop. (5) Two lamps by the work area are inconvenient to use. They have dimming switches located at the rear of each lamp that are not easy to reach. (6) Lumpy bed. The king sized bed was very lumpy. Combined that with a down blanket (why?), made for a difficult night of sleep the first night. (The trick was to sleep on top of the down, which helped to reduce the lumps.) (7) Coffee machine requires taking a short lesson. What? The coffee machine is not intuitive. Apparently, I am not the first (or the only) one perplexed by the machine since they have a lesson on TV (welcome channel) and a instruction card. Given the level of complexity, the coffee isn't all that good. On the positive: the pool is beautiful and the restaurant is pricey but very good (18% tip is built in the the bill, which appears to be standard for higher priced restaurants in Miami).

It was mostly an adult vacation, though I did bring my 4-year old daughter to stay with us for two of the nights. We had two suites - both beautifully decorated with a ton of space. That was the only nice thing about the Viceroy Miami. My comments: 1. A line at check-in. The reception also serves concierge, valet, room service - they field every call. In short, they are over-worked. 2. I asked for a bottle of champagne and truffles to be delivered to my friends (they had just gotten engaged) in the next room upon their arrival. The staff was nice, brought up stationery and waited while I filled out the card. My friends never received the delivery. I called the front desk and they promised to \"look into it\" - I'm still waiting to hear back from them. 3. Valet ($30 additional per day) did not have our car ready -- no matter how much time we called in advance. We even tried 45 minutes - at which point they brought us someone else's car. 4. No hairdryer in the bathroom -- not a big deal, we called the front desk twice to arrange for one to be deliverd. It never came. We called again the next morning. Still nothing. The third time we called, the woman at the front desk said, \"Well I called housekeeping and they told me that you already have one.\" (What kind of hospitality person would say that?) Clearly we did not. When we finally did manage to get a hair dryer it was broken. 5. Room service for four: After waiting an hour for our dinner, they managed to forget my daughter's order (though we were charged for it). 6. You will wait more than an hour for food service by the (mostly shaded, but beautiful) swimming pool. 7. The spa, while spectacularly decorated, was completely booked our entire stay. And the fitness classes were cancelled for two out of the four days (one day was a holiday - but still, this is a hotel). 8. Club 50. Never again. $17 dollar drinks in plastic cups. Small space, beautiful views, awkward crowd/vibe. I have never called the manager of a hotel for anything in my life -- but this was beyond ridiculous and I had to say something. The manager returned my call at 10pm that night (I missed her call). I finally got ahold of someone the next morning to explain our service issues. I simply received a nice lecture in return about how grateful he was that I called, because if these issues go unreported, he remains unaware of them and therefore cannot address them. While I didn't ask for anything, I suppose I was hoping for some nice, if small, gesture on behalf of management for all of our issues. I was left short there, too. Just a giant hotel bill and a very disappointing stay. I really wanted to be out of that hotel after just two nights.

In comparison the Viceroy let us down on a few things. Firstly the pool area does not get sunlight all day unlike the Mandarin when you could bathe in sunshine until late in the evening. The Viceroy, unfortunately because of the design the sun disapears behind the neighbouring buildings by 4pm, but also when the sunshine does hit the pool often it is only in a small proportion of the pool, which means everybody is huddled around a small area, making it cramped. We contacted concierge via e-mail regarding getting us Miami Dolphins tickets but they never responded and when I contacted reception about a late check out they told me I would have to do it when I got there and were confused by my e-mail and put my departing flight down as my arrival flight time. We did get concierge to sort tickets out for us when we got to Miami however and we ordered them through ticketmaster. Manadrin on the other hand, concierge sorted tickets for us via e-mail and offered us late checkout complimentary, compared to the crazy amount The Viceroy wanted to charge us. Room layout was better in the Mandarin as was room service. Our room some days at the Viceroy was not cleaned until after 3pm and turn down service was always way too ealry at between 6-7pm, when we were just getting ready. Little things like the Mandarin layout of being able to sit in your bath and watch tv, which you could have done with the Viceroy had they put the bath the other way round, which would have also made the taps easier to get to. My other complaint was the road noise from the hotel room, being right on the main road, every night we were woken by cars beeping their horns and racing round like idiots. I know other reviews have mentioned Club 50 and the door staff, a couple of our party decided to check it out one night and were made to stand outside on the pavement, being told off for standing on the kerb at one point and when they were allowed access 5 minutes later when they got up to it, it was empty!!! It was just a pointless waste of time having to stand outside and made to wait for 5 minutes. Apparently the views are stunning but other than that it isn't worth visiting.

The Hotel was very modern and had excellent decor. The staff was very accomodating and top notch. We ate at EOS and Bistro E for both dinner and lunch respectively. Dinner on Thanksgiving was a fixed menu featuring, of course, Turkey but the best part was the squash soup. Lunch at Bistro E (the same location as EOS at night) was very good and an excellent value if you have one of the daily $15 specials which was 3 courses as well as a pint of beer. We enjoyed the offering of the day and was actually quite a bit of food. Snacks at the Cafe Icon were sufficient for a pool side drink/sandwich. The pool area was massive but a bit noisy due to construction/remodeling going on. We also spent time at Club 50 up on the top floor of the hotel. It had excellent views of the surrounding area and a large, relaxing outdoor space if you want to sip a scotch and smoke a cigar. Probably the best part of the hotel was the spa. Stunning white everywhere including a lounge area of small jacuzzi's and pools. Really amazing experience. The stay was not without a few snafu's, one being the Hotels' fault and the other seems to have been software issue. Still, the issue which the they did drop the ball on was quickly remediated that's it's not even worth complaining about. The service was exceptional. Lastly, the room was nice. We stayed in one of the 06 rooms which overlooked Brickell.

The original room had a problem with the AC and a chunk of plaster fell on my friend's head. After calling the bell desk, we were promptly moved -- to a luxurious furnished two-bedroom apartment in the Condo tower for Viceroy. AWESOME! Great views, wonderful furnishings, top-notch amenities. The pool desk is very Vegas-like, minus the annoying hip-hop music bleeding from an adult pool. It's relaxing, yet has a great social atmosphere. The east end of the pool deck has an amazing tanning area with views of Key Biscayne and Brickell Key. There is food service, and the service is just like Vegas -- slightly pricy and very slow. Taxis are plentiful and the Metromover station is just one block west, providing EZ access to bustling Mary Brickell Village, Financial District Station (Segafredo, Brickell Irish Pub, Novecento, Gordon Biersch), and downtown.

This was supposed to be a special night, a joyous occasion, but instead my birthday was ruined. I am now left with the impression that this is how the Viceroy operates, and allows its employees to treat its hotel guests.

For the phenomal rate our 2 rooms (one for the kids and one for the adults), the rooms were spectacular - marble, flat screen TV, large shower, double vanity, and luxurious bed (could have slept all day). We had to leave the room to lounge by the specatcular infinity pool overlooking Byscayne Bay. After enjoying an amazing tme each morning at the Spa/Fitness Center (who couldn't workout with glass windows overlooking Byscayne Bay?) This was my ritual every morning for 6 days - away at 8, work out til 10, eat a few prunes and drink the cranberry juiice at the spa (think they were telling us something?), shower, then head to the pool for sun and swimming (with almost no one in this massive pool). At 11:30am the kids and my partner arrived for a brief swim before it was time for food at the hotels bistro/e - the service was beyond excellent and the food was outstanding - coming from DC, the decor was refreshing and relaxing. We are really food snobs (just to ourselves) - the food here was fantastic. One of the best things about this vacation - aside from the our 2 great kids and my wonderful partner, was the great staff at the Viceroy (my kids know that - if I receive great service I will always let the manager know - which isn't very often) - well, the service pool side was 10+ (even during a busy weekend). All of our servers were anticipated when we wanted something - I just hate to look for a waiter. One waiter in particular, David, was just outstanding (wish I could remember the name of the other servers - they were great too). David was always busy AND always took time to check in with every person to see if they needed more food, drinks, etc. He was an absolute professional. Well, this review has gone on too long.

Upon checking in the front desk attendant was very nice, she helped us get checked in with no issues. Check in was painless. I don't know how to describe the lobby decor but it was different. I like it though. Everything seemed new. I asked the attendant if the hotel was new and she said it was 18 months old. She directed us around the corner to the elevators. There is a little alcove behind the check in desk before you get to the elevators where you can purchase items. At the elevator I couldn't figure out how to get it to move and the bellhop saw us informed us that we had to use our room key to activate the elevator to take us up to our floor. I thought that was a great security feature. I have never been to a hotel with this feature. So again a nice surprise. In our room, everthing seemed new and pretty (914 and 907 were our room numbers) the furniture was dark and the bathroom door was a wooden double door leading to the large bathroom. There was a seperate little room in the bathroom where the toilet was with a door so you dont have to see your spouse while you're in the shower. The shower was marble (or a similar stone) from floor to ceiling. The shower was HUGE! Double sinks and I had to (again) figure out how to use to the sink. Fancy bathroom. The bathroom was huge with large containers of lotion and body wash (smelled really good) to use and to purchase if you choose. The bedroom was spacious. It was very pleasing to the eyes. It was very unlike any Marriott or chain hotel I have been to. The carpet was super soft and so were the huge king sized pillows and the soft comfy bed! Excellent. The pool was on the 15th floor.

(I had the same issue at the Epic Hotel right next door, I guess thats the price you have to pay for staying in a hio hotel). Besides this small matter, everything is perfect. I will be going to Miami in a couple of weeks and will stay at the Viceroy for sure.

This was a college graduation gift and our intent was to hang by the pool, eat well and use the spa/gym. I researched a lot of Miami hotels prior to this trip and I was extremely happy I selected the Viceroy. The hotel is an easy ride from the airport and is centrally located in the Brickell Bay area. Check in was a breeze with a very friendly front desk staff member. Our room was huge and fabulous! I cannot say enough about how clean, spacious and modern our end unit double queen room was. We were pleasantly surprised with our accommodations! Per the other reviews, the pool area is amazing and offers great views of the bay. There are plenty of lounge chairs, day beds and shady areas. There is a small thatched roof stand right by the pool with an attendant handing out towels every morning. The poolside restaurant, Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Icon, offered up tasty Panini sandwiches, salads and drinks. They are open for breakfast and lunch. The caf\u00c3\u00a9 offers poolside service so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to wave down a server to order your lunch and/or drink selection. The spa and health club are, by far, one of the best I have ever experienced in a hotel setting. The gym has beautiful views and offers up the latest in cardio and weight machines. The common spa area is incredibly striking with chandeliers, huge floor to ceiling windows and soft music. I did not have a spa treatment during my time but took full advantage of the gym and the spa locker/shower area. The gym also offers a listing of daily cardio classes such as zumba, spinning, yoga, dance, etc. Club 50 at the Viceroy is very cool, however, extremely expensive for cocktails so it would be pricey to stay there all night wining and dining. There are some great restaurants right in the area. The Capital Grill is directly across the street. We ended up there one night at the bar to watch game 7 of the NBA finals. Both the service and food were top notch! We also ventured over to the Epic Hotel which is right next door. They have a happy hour every night with \u00c2\u00bd price drinks (which is helpful considering the drinks are about $18). The bar is trendy and full of after work 20 -40 somethings sipping champagne and enjoying the live music. Right inside the Epic Hotel is a brand new restaurant called Zuma. I highly recommend this restaurant for a night out! We opted for the tasting menu ($90/person) and were offered up a non stop selection of tasty treats! Definitely worth the splurge.

We felt that they could have been more friendly. They eventually warmed up to us by the 4th day, but we were checking out at this point. The other issue was the location. There is almost nothing going on in this area (financial district). On Saturday afternoon, we had to walk 6 blocks to get to a Starbucks because the closest one was not open on weekends. My friends and I wanted to go to South Beach every day, and this also became an issue, as cab rides are $25 - $30 each way. If you plan to frequent SoBe, I highly recommend staying at one of the hotels there. I had the pleasure of visiting the Fontainbleau, the W, and the Mondrian, which were all gorgeous and more convenient. One last thing, the illy machine makes great coffee, but it's not free. I believe we were charged $1/pod at check-out. There is also no ice machine. We called the front desk several times a day for them to bring up ice.

To offer the upgrade even though we were on a stay 3 nights pay for 2 i thought was extremely generous and its touches like this that make you spread the word about a place and make you want to return.....hence the review. The room itself was simply gorgeous....best ive ever stayed in and ive stayed at a few 5 star hotels worldwide. Doorway lead into main room with black marble floor that housed a kitchen that could be put out of sight with a sliding partition with the most gorgeous furniture that resembled authentic havana. There was a balcony that looked over a beautiful church, next was the bedroom with a beautiful 4 poster framed bed which lead into the biggest bathroom ever. Really loved the illy coffee machine as it was by far the nicest coffee of our trip. The pool area was really nice with loads of loungers available, particularly loved the double loungers....so comfy! The view at the end of the infinity pool was stunning as you looked out towards miami beach. The spa was visually stunning but found it not very relaxing, a bit pretentious if im honest. A bit like the club 50 that i think is affiliated to the hotel, amazing to be in a pool on the 50th floor or having a drink but a bit too pretentious for us, just a personal thing so dont let it put you off. The location is downtown which to be honest i liked as pretty quiet at night but south beach is the place to be in the evening and so you were looking at a $20 taxi each way to get there. We got the bus to south beach for $2 during the day from a stop only 10 min walk from Hotel so getting around is easy.

One of the things that we noticed is that while the hotel itself is a unique hotel as it relates to the layout and the rooms, we did notice the service of the hotel was actually very good. We travelled about the same time (May) and on our last trip, they had several people at the front desk to help you to your room, nice service by the poo, and excellent spa service. My how a year can make a difference. For most of our stay, what we saw were salesman walking around trying to sell condo units of the Viceroy. Not a problem or a nuisance. What was more troubling was the lack of service provided by the hotel. For example, there was no one in the fitness center to help with machines, wiping down machines, filling up water. Nothing. At the pool, there was no food service at the pool on the 15th floor. You would have to go to the cafe in order to get a drink or food. Last year, we had people helping us often, taking up plates, bringing drinks, and someone offering free fruit as you enter the pool area. What was more disturbing is what was NOT happening on the 50th floor. The pool up there wasn't even staffed. The pool isn't arranged with chairs, it's now more of a seating area I guess for Club 50 around the pool. The bar wasn't open, no one to offer food, and the restaurant wasn't staffed. We found it funny that if anyone wanted a beer, they could help themselves as the chest was wide open for use. All you needed was a bottle opener. It's evident that the hotel is trying to reduce cost as much as possible. Perhaps Club 50 didn't take off the way they had hoped. I mean we even noticed they changed the channels in the rooms. It used to be over 250 channels, now it's about 30. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about that, but it's the little difference you're beginning to see from this hotel. The rooms are still very nice, plenty of towels, nice shower, bathtup is small, but overall still very nice. We had a junior suite, and it was nice and cold as we entered the room. The room thermostat was at 66 degrees (they could probably save money on that by turning it up to 72). We got it for a rate of $185 for 1 night on Perfect Escapes, but if I had paid more, based upon my previous stay, I would have been disappointed. Would I stay there again? Probably not.at least, not if I have to get up and get my own drinks at the pool or have none at all if I go to the pool on the 50th floor.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful hotel.......horrible spa\u201d", "Author": "Michelle_Chicago_1", "ReviewID": "UR63197855", "Content": "The hotel and staff were great and if wasnt for the spa I would have rated it higher, but they claim they are a hotel AND spa and that is too bad.

The rates over Easter Weekend were also excellent compared to other hotels in this class, so no regrets, but we would not choose to stay here again for leisure, however I would recommend it for business travel. The reason it isn't ideal for a vacation is that the services you crave are not comparable to usual hotels. This hotel is more like luxury hotel rooms in a condominium complex. The vallet is adequate but not as fast or friendly as you would experience at the Delano. If there is more than one vehicle off loading luggage etc. at the same time you are going to have to wait on getting your stuff to the room, it appears as though there may have only been one bell boy. The reception ok for a condo- small and cold for a hotel. Elevators, hallways etc. everything is very dark. The decor is black and dark greens. In the room the TV was on one of the side walls, so you couldn't watch it comfortably from bed, however there was a sofa in the room for this purpose, but we really wanted to chill out. The upstairs restaurant and roof deck make the hotel, without them this would not qualify at all. The room service, although the food was good, again they don't leave the tray table to eat off of as they need it for other deliveries, so you are left with a little table that is about knee high to eat off of, basically eating off your lap. We had a corner unit and lots of windows, this was a highlight. The bathrooms were very luxurious and comfortable, no complaints there. The beds were comfortable for sleeping (less the position in relation to the TV). The Spa looks amazing form the photos but the pool you can see from the reception desk- no privacy and the whole place was missing atmosphere.

The hotel is part of an imposing complex of three fifty plus story buildings that contain eighteen hundred condos. Less then ten percent of the condos are currently occupied. The lobby of the hotel is nice but a small area, nothing more then a place to check in and come and go. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. There was a living room/dining room that had a great look to it, kind of old Hollywood opulence. There was also a convenience kitchen, hidden behind sliding panels, and a powder room. We liked this room a lot which included a black & green marble floor. The bedroom was good size but a little on the dark side, maybe because the walls were a medium green color. The bathroom was very large and lux with separate tub, shower, and water closet. The lighting was not great and there was no place to put your towel for a shower except on the floor next to the shower door, no hook. The bathroom was so large it would have been nice to have a larger shower or even a piece of furniture in the room. There are several pools located on the fifteenth floor pool level that are also used by condo owners. The standout one is the three hundred foot long infinity edge lap pool. This pool is indeed very cool to look at, and a fun challenge to swim laps in. The infinity edge side overlooks Biscayne Bay and the high rises of Brickell Key. The pools, however, are surrounded closely by the three condo/hotel towers. If you plan on spending more then two hours out by the pool during the winter months, you will need to move around to keep up with the sun as the buildings cast large shadows this time of year. They are also a little intimidating to sit near. There are also several fun and interesting play and lounge areas around the pools. The spa and accompanying gym are a tour de force of high design. The spa pools are in a two story room with floor to ceiling windows with great views. The plunge pools are set in a sea of a white marble floor, flanked by dark wood decorative library areas at each end with fireplaces. The area is very cool looking, and a large yellow Murano like chandelier tops it off. A juice bar is located just off the water lounge area. The adjoining gym is very attractive with a full set of equipment and lots of cardio options. The gym is lined with a wall of windows overlooking the water. The locker rooms are also very nice with more white marble, cool design, steam and sauna, and yet again more windows with great views. The only drawback to the spa is that the location is very far away from the hotel. It is located in a different building requiring you to walk outside across the entire length of the pool level. Not really a problem unless it is raining. We had a package with a credit that we used at the hotel restaurant for two breakfast meals, one lunch, and a room service dinner. The restaurant is located on the fifteenth floor, the same as the pool level. Once again the design of the restaurant itself was fantastic and glamorous. There is also an outdoor seating area. Our meals were good and service in the near empty space fine but we did have a problem with our lunch meal. When the bill came, we were charged ten dollars each for plain non-alcoholic lemonades. We questioned this charge twice and were told it was the correct price. This was six dollars more then what we were charged for the room service price the night before. After leaving the restaurant, I called the front desk to complain and the charge was reduced to four dollars. We felt very strongly that the waiter intentionally overcharged us. The location of the hotel is central, easy to get to South Beach and other areas of Miami. Unfortunately the hotel is located very close to busy Brickell Avenue. There is almost no way to escape the noise of the road since most rooms of the hotel face the direction of the road. A few rooms per floor face north and may have a little less noise but you still see and hear Brickell Avenue. These rooms also have a view of the Miami River so you may want to ask for one of them, but I do not think they get direct sunlight. The entire back side of the hotel is a parking garage so there are no rooms facing away from the street noise. Each room has a balcony but I do not think most people would enjoy spending too much time on them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as most face the street and there is no furniture on them. The club on the fiftieth floor is very nice with great views. The design is very similar to the rooms. The pool at this level seems to be for show only, as it was never available to swim in during the days of our stay. To get to the club, you take a separate set of elevators off the main lobby. This is how the hotel is set up, very cut up with no central core to it. All the public areas of the hotel are in very different places. This was not a problem for us, but it can make you feel like you are staying in an apartment building, and not a hotel. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Other then the issue at the restaurant, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the hotel is really great and different. We also liked the free internet, something more hotels should be providing. The spa area and gym are also available without the extra charge many hotels like to add on. Street noise and a cumbersome layout would be our only complaints. But the unique d\u00c3\u00a9cor, fantastic pool, outrageous spa, all combine to make a stay worthwhile especially before all those condos start filling up and residents start taking more space at the pool and spa.", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel, wonderful staying\u201d", "Author": "RhodamGreaterLondon", "ReviewID": "UR57690823", "Content": "Great location with stunning view on the south beach, best room I've ever seen, super service everything was absolutely perfect.

One of the nicest hotel rooms we've stayed in ever - and both of us have done extensive traveling. In the past, we have stayed in South Beach, but this time, we knew the weather wasn't going to be great and we had a 3 1/2 year old, so we wanted to stay at a hotel that was nicer, in case we ended up spending more time in the room than we'd like. Thank goodness we did. We found a great deal - stay for 3 nights, get the 3rd night free. I think we were upgraded to a suite. We walked in and immediately to the right was a 1/2 bath. Then a dining table and kitchenette (mini fridge w/room in it, stovetop, sink, dishes, silverware All-Clad pots/pans, Illy espresso maker), leading into a living room area w/ couch, 4 chairs, desk & flat screen. The bedroom was behind two doors and led to the biggest bathroom. So much privacy! We had our own room and our son slept out in the living room on the couch (we moved some chairs/table around so he was blocked in and couldn't fall out.) We had a river view, looking right out over the bridge, which was great b/c our son got to watch the boats go by and the bridge go up and down. We kept the sliding door open all night, so it was somewhat noisy with cars driving by, but not bad. And we never heard another guest the whole time. The pool area was incredible. I wish the weather was warmer, but it didn't stop us from swimming both days, even when it was stormy and windy (and it can get windy up there), as the water was warm. We had breakfast only at the hotel - once at the restaurant and once at the cafe. It was good, but it was expensive. Especially when all I wanted was a cafe con leche and pastel from a neighborhood cuban spot. They were doing a photo shoot at the cafe when we got there, but the waitress was super nice and got us in the back. For lunch/dinner, we ended up hopping on the Metromover (free train) a block away to go to Mary Brickell Village (I think that's the name - you could walk there too) where there was everything from very nice restaurants to a Baja Fresh, and a less expensive italian spot, just past Baja, in which the food was brought out super fast - a plus when you have a hungry, tired kid. The best part for me was the spa/fitness area. They have classes that hotel guests are able go to for free. I did a yoga class that was supposed to be poolside, but due to the weather was brought indoors. No one else was there, so I had a private yoga session with a great teacher. Then I stayed for a Zumba class afterward. There were a few other women in the class and everyone was so friendly! I wish I could have had more time to go to the spa b/c it looked beautiful. Next time. My husband used the weight room and said it was one of the nicer hotel gyms he's seen. All the staff at the hotel was very nice - from the time I called a few days before our trip to check on transportation options, through the end. I was worried about bringing a pre-schooler to an \"it\" hotel like this. But I never got the feeling he wasn't welcome. As I mentioned the weather wasn't cooperative, which was a big bummer.

The choice was between the Viceroy and the Epic. Compared to the Marriot at $400 per both were a deal. I choose the Viceroy based on room descriptions and free internet. I was not disappointed! The hotel is at the north east end of the financial district. The Epic, across the waterway, includes a yacht club and is a bit more impressive from the exterior. The Viceroy is more discrete but wonderful from the interior. The Viceroy is an astounding hotel. The Junior suite was spacious, well appointed, private and very comfortable. The staff were attentive but discrete. Several here have commented on the room and it was great. The bathroom is a large room appointed in granite and marble. it has double sinks, separate shower and bath with plenty of space. If you are in to exercise this is the place for you. The exercise room is part of the spa and includes cardio and circuit equipment and free weights and is equipped with TVs. It overlooks the Biscayne bay . I used it every day. It was great. The deck on the 15th floor was everthing previous reviewers have covered with several heated pools and astounding views of Biscayne Bay. The Viceroy pays very careful attention to security. The elevators are keyed. It was not unusual to encounter a roving security person daily walking the halls. At one point I noted one checking doors to ensure that guests had completely closed their doors. On the pool level it was quite common to see a security guard discretely walking the pool area. As with the other services of the hotel the attention to security went far beyond what I have encountered at Marriot, Hyatt or Westin. The 15th floor restaurant is gourmet. At breakast the servings are large. At dinner they are small. The small-portion concept used by the restuarant at dinner takes a bit of getting used to but, by encouraging the incorporation of multiple small-servings in the meal it made for great gourmet dining. It reminds me of my trips to New Orleans where I typically order multiple appetizers instead of an entree because I want to experience all the flavors. The Viceroy is a special hotel and deserves its 5 star rating. If you can sneak in at a discount rate do it. As it becomes better known these inexpensive rates will disappear. I will be heading back.

With views of the water, I worked out and never thought the gym lacked for equipment. The spa offers a signature raindrop massage with six essential oils. It's a must. Plus, I took advantage of the indoor jacuzzis and plunge pools, which hotel guests can use at any time without an extra fee. The only downside to this hotel is the lack of staff at times.

At night many people come to go to Club 50 and the incredible views. The hotel room was very large. We had a corner room with a terrace. The bed was a large modern four post bed and was very comfortable. Room had a flat screen tv. There was also a sitting area. The room overall was very spacious and larger than I expected. The bathroom was huge. It had a good size tub that filled up quickly and a very good shower. The toilet was in a separate room. Hotel had very good water pressure. Just a key note, dont take the soap,shampoo etc. The hotel uses this \"Neil George\" line of products, which I have never heard of, but the hotel charges you $45 for every bottle you take. Its ridiculous. The staff at the hotel is very friendly and professional. The maid did an excellent job cleaning the room and they had a turn down service as well. Front desk staff was very helpful. The rooftop pool is amazing. It is a huge infinity pool that is heated. There is plenty of seating. Seating included lounge beds and chairs. There are great views of the water as well. The Spa for the hotel is amazing. Great sauna, steam room and plunge pools. It feels like a library. Very trendy. The fitness center is more than sufficient for a hotel. There are large dumb bells, plenty of cardio machines and free classes ( spin, pilates etc). I would definitely stay here again. One thing that is horrible is the $30 a night parking. It definitely pissed me off. Other than the $30 parking and the $45 shampoo ( i didnt take it obviously) the stay could not have been better.

They have not spared any expense at this hotel. From the ornate fixtures to the solid (and I mean solid) marble ice buckets....to the South Coast down pillows and fluffy bedding, everything was top notch. We were impressed at the speedy check in process (even though we checked in around midnight when they were busy with people going up to the club 50.) Unfortunately we were too tired to check the Club out....perhaps next time. The pool on the 15th floor is something of a wonder. With all it's little nooks and crannies there is something for everyone....whether you just want a quiet siesta in one of the cabanas or a relaxing soak in the huge hot tub. The Viceroy has it all. I think we were the only people at the pool on Sunday morning and we enjoyed it for a few hours it was so tranquil. Teh pool area was so breathtakingly beautiful it was hard to leave. On Sunday morning, before hitting the pool area, we enjoyed Brunch in the restaurant and it was really yummy the champange/orange juice drink was a nice touch and the way they present the condiments for breakfast was really attractive. The hostess was very accommodating when we were not happy with our table and requested another and the wait staff were very friendly...they even noticed us taking our self-portraits and asked if we would like them to take the picture for us.

Although I'd read good reviews, having stayed at its LA sister I was expecting style over substance. I'm glad to say I was proved wrong. I was here for a business conference, and they hosted us really well. Very attentive staff, and the setting was efficient while not being corporate. The whole place has a wow about it, and I don't know how other visitors can criticize the decor. It is certainly quite eclectic - a fusion of Asian inflences - but it is a refreshing change from the yawn understated minimalism of so many modern 'design' hotels. All put together with a good eye and with quality pieces. The rooms feel luxuriously appointed, very comfy beds, and even the standard ones come with a very clever hidden little kitchenette (though who would stay at this type of hotel, I don't know). Lovely bath with large separate shower. It's partly open to the bedroom - which I really like. (But if you're sharing you'll need to remember to shut the door to the loo!) The suites are - of course - even nicer. There's a fabulous bar on the 50th floor. Amazing views. It comes with its own pool and has indoor and outdoor space. It is expensive, but I don't think it's out of line with other similar type places. The bar staff were friendly and knowledgeable, and had time to recommend other lesser-known spirits. The bar shut early - at midnight - and there was no effort to warn us it was closing which was a little irritating. The restaurant on the 15th floor, Eos, was again beautifully appointed. The staff seemed a little all over the place, though very friendly. No maitre d' meant that it took ages to get seated, with the girl at the bar taking over so that we didn't have to stay standing. The food is expensive for what it is - and is guilty of trying too hard to be different. Lots of strange combos that probably shouldn't have made it past the experiment. The real 'wow' is the pool deck, on the 15th floor. It is very large - it would have to be seriously busy to feel crowded. The view is broken up by lots of low trees, so it feels fairly private despite sitting between 3 towering apartment blocks. The pools (there are 3) are amazing. 1st a large square paddling pool - I guess for kids or for people who just want to cool down on a hot day. 2nd a large square heated pool, not deep but swimmable. And then finally a very big and long infinity pool - it looks like you could swim off the side of the building. In fact when you get down that end you see that there is actually another lower deck where you can sit on day beds and stare out at Brickell Quay. Quite incredible. And then the Spa - another wow space. It has what it calls a wet lounge - seats and sofas dotted around a white marble room with a shallow water floor, and then places with deeper hot and cold jacuzzis. My description doesn't do it justice. The prices were pretty eye-watering however, so I'm afraid I can't comment on the quality of the treatments. A well equipped gym also. It's in the business district so it may not be the spot for a weekend in Miami when people tend to want South Beach. But for a business trip combining pleasure I'd say it would be perfect.

Excellent stay!\u201d", "Author": "Gatoresq", "ReviewID": "UR27475592", "Content": "Went with my wife to celebrate our anniversary (without the kids) and we were really happy to find this place. Top-notch service throughout the property, not to mention that it's gorgeous - beautiful things everywhere - really high-end design wherever you look, almost as though it was \"staged\" to perfection. Yet even with the very cool, hip and blisteringly expensive vibe going on, it was still very comfortable, and although we have our own kids, we were selfishly happy NOT to see a ton of kids there - especially with spring break going on locally. Mind you, though, the hotel is part of a condo complex (The Icon - three 50 story towers) which although completed, was 99% unoccupied (typical now-a-days in South Florida), but once it fills up (which in the current economic climate could take years...) the incredible peace and quiet that we found throughout the property will likely (and sadly) dissipate to some degree. But for now, our room was nice. We had a 1 bed/2 bath suite. Great AC, spotless throughout, mainly a city view (although you could see the water also) and although there was no furniture on the balcony, we were very-well provided for inside, so we didnt care. Comforable beds, large marble-covered bathrooms, and even a small kitchen-ette complete with cook-top, microwave, sink and espresso maker. Overall, very comfortable, clean and pleasing to the eye. The pool areas on floors 15 and 50 were both beautiful - and the private club way up on 50 was Vegas/SoBe cool - but my favorite part of the hotel - by far - was the spa. Holy moly it's gorgeous! For gym/spa freaks, you really have to see it to appreciate it...and the staff there can't do enough for you; the trainer was totally game to help me out in the gym, which had tons of cardio machines and was loaded with both free weights and top-of-the-line Technogym machines. I did a spin class also. Good instructor, and he played some really cool house music from this incredible sound system, which made the 1 hour class fly by. Locker room w/ steam, sauna, and, again, marble everywhere. Overally, an incredible facility - so much more beautiful than any spa I've ever been too, not to mention, again, that it was empty, which made it than much quieter. Didn't get any spa treatments, not so much because of the astronomical prices, but more so because I was relaxed enough without it. The only area that we thought could be improved was in the food (taste - not service) dept - lunches were good, dinner good but not great, and room svc breakfast was \"eh\" at best. We were told that the hotel is bringing in a michelin-starred chef within the next few weeks - and if he's worth his \"star\", then that could the proverbial icing on the cake... We'd definately return. Enjoy the \"introductory\" rates while they last, because I have a feeling that once word gets out about this place, they are undoubtedly going to shoot up.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cIncredible Hotel !!!\u201d", "Author": "Chicago-60653", "ReviewID": "UR26348410", "Content": "This is the most incredible hotel I have ever stayed at in the world. The hotel is classified as a 4 1/2 stars, but should definitely be moved up to 5 stars. This a new hotel which opened in early February-2009. We stayed for 3 weekend nights in March-2009. The following are the things that most impressed me about this hotel: (1) The hotel service exceeded my expectations. From the moment you drive up to the minute you leave, you are treated like a King. There are no airs put on by the staff, but rather they are extremely friendly and attentive to your needs. (2) The size of the rooms are beyond adequate. I received a special rate on a one bedroom suite which measured about 780 square feet. This is quite large. Even their standard King rooms measure about 500 square feet, which is more space than you will get at most hotels. (3) The outside deck on the 15th floor is worth the visit alone. The space covers 2 acres and has one of the world's largest infinity pool that I have ever seen. There are at least 3 large pools on the 15th floor and the most comfortable seating & lounging spaces. (4) An included fitness center and movie room as part of the hotel. I could not believe the fitness center and movie room were free of charge. I would of happily paid to use this great space, but to my surprise it was indeed free. There is also a nice spa which charges reasonable rates. I could go on for days talking about this hotel. Simply put, this is a must stay at hotel.

The staff was really fantastic. The pool on the hotel's top floor (Club 50) is very nice, calm and relaxed, and the views are great from the 50th floor. Views from the hotel rooms look toward the city and not the bay (some of the rooms look over the Miami river and the city around it). The restaurant is very good. The menu isn't adventurous, but the quality is very high. I'd be happy eating there any day; the staff is great. The gym and spa at the condominium part of the complex is also beautiful (and huge).
