The hotel is actually in a great location as everybody has already posted: walking distance to the Rialto bridge area (4-5 minutes) walking distance to the Piazza San Marco (4-5 minutes) very quiet area -- you will hear the noise level drop 50% or more the moment you step in from San Lio street to the inner courtyard area where the hotel is. very near a lot of food shops / pizzeria / gelateria that are open until late -- especially on San Lio, there was a good gelateria nearby (almost right outside the small street you emerge from) with reasonable price, there's a restaurant next door, and take out pizza in either direction after exiting the hotel. Hotel was reasonably priced as well Decorations in the hotel were pretty classic styled, but the bathrooms were actually VERY modern and brightly lit! Some of the rooms may seem darker because the lights take a long time to warm up and the walls of the room might be covered with dark silk decoration, but otherwise it was okay! If you come here during winter time though, you may want to bring slippers as the marble floor can be really cold!!", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cPerfect central location...authentic classic Venetian room!\u201d", "Author": "Ilycep", "ReviewID": "UR128089577", "Content": "Location is in walking distance of everything..easy to get to from the water taxi...cute venetian style room.

The room was booked through hotels.com. When we arrived in the evening we got a comfortable room but since the room was facing a tiny inner courtyard it was dark and felt a bit claustrophobic. I thought that there was no chance that we would be given another room since it was in August and the room was already paid for with no possibility to a refund. The man behind the reception desk spoke excellent English and told us that the hotel was fully booked but he went through their booking list and found another room which would be vacant from tomorrow. When returning in the afternoon the next day the staff had moved our baggage and belongings from our old room to our new room. The new room was so much nicer, airy and bright. This hotel takes good care of their guests and the staff behind the reception desk were always friendly and helpful. Good breakfast. Agree with other posters that the location is superb.

My only major complaint is the comfort of the beds. Ok, yes, I'm an American who enjoys memory foam and pillow top, but seriously, these mattresses are like wood. I don't think we slept straight through a single night. We kept waking up trying to shift around to find a comfortable position that didn't leave our shoulders and hips numb. That said, they're pretty typical for a 3-star European accommodation. Upgrade to a Mercure if you're serious about bed comfort. And while we found the hotel staff friendly and helpful, and the breakfast buffet perfectly adequate and the coffee even very good, I would also caution that when the hotel says it has \"fully air-conditioned rooms,\" that is not necessarily so. There was some sort of fan-ish A/C-looking thing above the door, but the first night we ran it, it started making dying noises around 3am. We live in Europe now and can also attest to the fact that Europeans in general do not trust A/C. So probably this contraption had never been run through an entire night. And anyway, it wasn't putting out cold air. A/C in this context means: \"possibly functional room-temp air blower.\" Since it was early April, we were able to sleep with the window open, but at the cost of a mosquito invasion - a tolerable hassle. This hotel is in an excellent location, and unless you are a high-maintenance traveler or have mobility problems (no elevator, narrow stairs only), you will enjoy your stay!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cgreat location BUT rock-hard bed\u201d", "Author": "mentos1999", "ReviewID": "UR127582742", "Content": "I would like to disclose an American is writing this review. I state this because our standards of comfort are different from those of our European cousins. Pros: - Great location, 10 minute walk or less to St. Mark's and Rialto. - Good continental breakfast with rolls, cheeses and meats, cereal options, the coffee was delicious - Staff member mans the desk 24/7 Cons: - Hard, hard bed. We could not sleep well on the rock slab of a bed in our room (queen sized bed) - WIFI, we paid 5Euros to use the Wifi for 24 hours (not consecutive hours but cumulative time). However, often I only had one bar of wifi in the bedroom. I saw other guests had to use their laptop next to the check in counter to receive adequate wifi coverage. - no A/C, it said the rooms were air-conditioned but we found a fan ventilation type system which did not adequately cool the room. Honestly, we did not need A/C in April, it was cool outside. Unfortunately, when we opened the windows, mosquitos came in during the night and feasted on our flesh. If we closed the windows, the room became oppressively stuffy. The first night we ran the A/C unit all night to recirculate the air but were awakened by a weezing sound from the machine. Thereafter we did not run it during the night. - safe, although there was a safe in the room, it was not large enough to put my MacBook Pro laptop in. So, again to review.

I spent 6 days in this hotel, all the 3 receptionists were very friendly, whenever asked they were wiling to help with sugestions about shortcuts, cheaper places to eat etc. All of them spoke english, french and german.

That we couldn't sleep by 1 am. First night the group of Franch students was having fun in the cafe by midnight, so we coudn't sleep by that time... the other night spanish students were having fun down next to the cafe by 1 am and it was a real nightmare! Well, we are young as well, but not everyone is eager to listen to the crazy noiuse by 1 am, while you're trying to fall asleep... what really shocked me is that the hotel stuff, hearing this sound and noise even did not come to these guys and did not ask tem to be quiter or to move to another place!

I also want to say that we are pretty easy going people. We're not expecting the Ritz and we know that European hotels are a whole different standard from Canadian and American hotels. But this place was so bad that it became a running joke! Every time something else happened or we noticed something else we'd just look at each other and say, \"Tripadvisor!\" Before anything else, if you want to risk having your things stolen, go to this hotel. They require you to leave your keys at the front desk when you leave, but then store them in labeled cubby holes behind the desk. No one checks your ID when you come in and ask for your key and there are always different people at the desk. So, in other words, if I come in off the street, I can look up and see that room 125 has keys in it, which means the owners aren't around. I can ask for those keys, they will give them to me without a second thought, I can proceed to go to the room and rob them blind. Needless to say, we kept our valuables with us at all times. The room itself was an alright size, except for the washroom which had a shower so small, you couldn't move in it. I can barely explain this shower as it was SO terrible. It had two plastic, push in doors. One of them didn't open properly because it would hit the bidet. Neither of them closed properly. If you turned on the water it would spray out onto the floor, which means you have to climb into the shower and close the doors before turning on the water and just deal with the freezing water until it warmed up. The doors were covered in mold in all the creases and the shower was so small that if you turned you would either hit the door open, or knock the facet handle, switching the water temperature. There were no racks or anything to put soap or shampoo, which meant it needed to be kept on the floor. Imagine how fun it is to bend over in a shower like that??? I'm a small girl, but my husband is almost six feet! The sheets were alright, but the blankets on the bed were just dirty and gross and had rips in them. Blankets in the closet were no better, they looked like they'd never been washed EVER. The pillows (there were only two) were so thin, there may as well have not been any! I used my neck pillow from the plane. My husband was jealous and woke up with a stiff neck. I think I remember them saying that the rooms are soundproof. IF they say that, it is a lie. First of all, the walls are covered in fabric(?), but the windows are regular windows. Our room faced the front and underneath is an alley and a restaurant, which was open very late. It would get very noisy and one night we had the pleasure of hearing someone puking outside. In the morning the restaurant and our hotel would drag out the metal chairs and tables, making another racket. Breakfast is served from 8-10. You'd think in two hours they could manage to serve a decent breakfast, but the first morning we came out around 9am and there was no food. Seriously! Nothing was left. None of the restaurant workers seemed in any rush to refill anything either. I finally had some stale rice krispies in warm milk. They have mini danishes, which look like they were poured from a bag (and tasted that way too). They had one left, I let my husband have it. The next morning we came much earlier and it was marginally better. If you are an older individual or in a wheelchair, there is no elevator, only one of those chairs that goes up the stair banister. It was broken when we were there though, so I wouldn't rely on that. The location is good, very central, but this hotel just purely sucks!

I was worried about finding the hotel but had no problem since I followed the directions listed on TripAdvisor in one of the reviews. We took the Alilaguna Orange Line from Marco Polo Airport to Rialto. It cost 15E but if you purchase the tickets online in advance, the cost is 13E. There is one bridge you must cross to get to the hotel so be aware that you will have to carry your luggage up and down stairs. Hotel Canaletto is located on a small, interior courtyard between St. Mark's Square and Rialto Bridge, away from bury foot traffic areas. Upon arrival, Marco, the hotel clerk arranged for someone to bring our luggage up to our room. There are not elevators and we were on the first floor. He also gave us a map of Venice and a brief orientation. The room was small but it overlooked the square. The wallpaper needed replacement and the TV was 12 inches and the reception was snowy with only BBC and CNN in English. The bed was two twins put together but was comfortable. We asked for and received extra pillows. The bathroom was ok. It had a bidet, which we didn't use. Putting toilet paper in the toilet was not permitted so we had to put it in the waste basket. Paper was dispensed in 2 square at a time. The shower had no curtain and you had to hold the nozzle to rinse off which made it inconvenient. Shampoo was provided but no conditioner. A very small piece of soap was also provided. Breakfast was fine. Coffee, croissants, rolls, cold cuts (must be a European thing) and cereal. We asked the night clerk for some boiling water to make tea and he was kind enough to provide it. All in all, a decent place to stay but certainly not the Ritz.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Venice, Italy", "Title": "\u201cWe will be back for a third time\u201d", "Author": "TheRoyalcouple", "ReviewID": "UR116407409", "Content": "Stayed here in 2009 for our honeymoon and loved it so much that we booked it again for this trip.

A man who worked there refused to help us and said it wasn't his problem, so we went to find another hotel somewhere near. But we already know that we hardly could find a hotel in the cener of Venice for that price... But we tried our luck and came to Hotel Canaletto. A woman at reception desk listened to our story and tried to help us, despite the fact that we just came from the street. She spent almost an hour for us and find a great solution for us!

I was booked into a single room, but they gave me a double for single use when I got there (not sure if they actually have single rooms?) The room was nice, not enormous, but big enough, with a double bed (actually two twins pushed together), a little desk, a wardrobe (with quite a few hangers yay! and a safe), a minifridge concealed in a little cupboard, a TV (which I didn't switch on at all) and an ensuite, with a shower, toilet, bidet, sink, lit mirror and hairdryer. It was nice, done in a Rococo style (which I happen to like, some people may think it is a little fancy and girly) and comfortable, and very clean. The cleaners who came in every day to the room must have also changed the bedspread every day as I spilt a little drink on the cover which wasn't noticeable unless you knew, and when I came back later that day it was gone, which I have noticed is not common practice in every hotel. There was an air conditioner/heating panel in the room too, but the temperature was fine and I didn't use it. The front desk staff was very nice too, efficient and charming. They spoke excellent English,and I think I heard them speaking French and German too. I happen to speak a little Italian which was nice to be able to communicate in their native language, but would've been absolutely fine if I didn't. Breakfast was a standard Italian style, cereals, fruits, yoghurts, toast and rolls and crackers and spreads, pastries, little ham slices. There were juices and water, and a woman came round and took drinks orders for tea/coffee. If you would like a cappucino/latte/espresso/hot chocolate etc they will happily make one. Be aware, sometimes in Italy (particualrly in a cafe or patisserie) if you order a 'caffe' (coffee) you may get an espresso as standard. If you want a filter coffee you want to order a Caffe Americano, or American coffee. For milk, in either tea or coffee add 'con latte' (pronounced lah-tay) to your order. I The breakfast room did fill up quickly, there are only about 40 or so seats, and after 9am it did fill up. It is self service apart from hot drinks. which you tell the woman for. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but there is a restaurant next to the hotel called Cantina Canaletto, which I think offered a substantial discount to guests, although I didn't fully check it out. The location of the hotel is really good, about 5 minutes walk from the Rialto and Piazza San Marco. It is a vibrant area full of life, but it tucked away so you do feel in a quiet peaceful street. It is really easy to get around Venice either on foot or on vaporetto, which are the city waterbus system, which you can buy 12,24,48 or 72 hour travelcars for, or pay for single hour long tickets. Vencie can seem like a labyrinth maze of little alleys, but unless you are headed for somewhere hard to find and spoecific do not worry too much about maps (although the hotel did give a really good one on check in) as there are yellow signs directing you back to Rialto or San Marco, where you will easily be able to find the hotel. To find the hotel from the Rialto vaporetto stop walk towrds the bridge as if you were going to walk over it but turn right at the base, you will go past a bureau de change (cambio) and into a sqaure (Campo San Bartolomeo) on the opposite side of the square there is a shop called Stefanel, next to that is a bar called Nostra, and then there is an alley, and then a bank. Go down the alley between Bar Nostra and the bank, past a chocolate shop called Dolcemara, and over a bridge where there is bathroom fittings shop, and onto the street called Sallizada San Lio. After 50m on the right, you will see the sign for Hotel Canaletto, just before the Fujifilm shop, opposite Boutique di Gelato (which does great gelato incidentally). Turn down this alley, through a small square where you need to bear left (there is a sign on the wall painted something about Kaya) and you will then see the hotel on your left.
