So what I am going to say here is a real updated one. The hotel located in a nice quiet area although it is not very far from the main arractions. The bathroom is big and clean, plenty of hot water whenever you want to take shower. It says free WI-FI everywhere in the hotel but since our room is in the corner at first first, hence the singal in the room was very weak. I need to go to the corridor or the lobby to get internet connection. But it didn't bother me at all as you don't sit in your room to explore the internet all day long while you are on holiday. Only 5-10 minutes walk to Royal Palace, My partner and I walked to Gran Via (the heart of city center)almost everyday. If you wanted to go to Plaza de Toros (Bullring arena) take the red metro from Opera to Ventos(its the easiest way you don't need to change). You will see the Plaza when you come out from the metro. We bought 10 trips mentro tickets at airport for Euro 18 for two. Actually we didn't finish it because we walked to everywhere. There is a club on the groudfloor. I was worried the noise when I read some reviews here. To be honest I didn't hear anything but my partner told me he couldn't sleep well only for one night because of the noise. But overall he is happy for his stay too. We would recommend this hotel for everyone because it is in good location, nice friendly staff, free WI-FI., big bathroom, etc etc.", "Date": "September 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cSmall rooms but good service\u201d", "Author": "Naxrupa", "ReviewID": "UR134505390", "Content": "This hotel is located not far from the center - just few minutes from Royal palace and Calle Mayor.

After reading the reviews I booked a room (using TripAdvisor's comparison tool) through Booking.com. I've used them a few times in the past and highly recommend them for their great rates and the fact that they don't charge service fees like some others. Anyway, I booked it at an average rate of $67 per night, which I thought was great. There are better rates at hostals in Madrid and I looked into many but in the end decided on HRC because they had the most flexible cancellation policy (midnight the morning of your arrival or first night's rate) and the best reviews at the best price. I was not disappointed, in fact they did exceed my expectations. I did have to wait a bit for check as the gentleman was checking in a family and it seemed they had many questions, but it wasn't too bad, maybe five minutes? He checked me in quickly and I was on the way to my room (505) on the fifth floor (with a balcony, which I never imagined I would get). It was nice to have the balcony and the fifth floor room, it would have been a little nicer if the balcony had a chair and maybe a table, but still it was a great view! It was a small room, but I have stayed in smaller in Europe so I'm used to it, and not tiny by any means. There was a safe in the room, which I had read on here and I was very glad to see. There were several hangers and small drawers in the closet. There was a small desk, night stand, a chair, and a single bed in the room as it was a single room. The window/balcony door, don't worry it's more of a door but you do step over a low wall to go out was dressed sheer curtain. That might have been a problem for me after sunrise, had it not been for the roll down metal shutters on the outside which not only kept the room dark until I was ready to get out of bed and roll them up but also would have been great in the event of a hurricane. Hey, you never know = ) I truly appreciated those shutters because I have a very hard time sleeping with any light. Going out to the bars was on the agenda every night but one so I am glad they were there plus they were an added measure of security. The bathroom was pretty big for a single room, it had a bathtub if you're into baths and a rain shower head, which was honestly the first time I've stayed at a hotel with one of those (and I've stayed at many, many hotels, from bed and breakfasts, to budget hotels, to luxury hotels all over the world. Did I mention how exceptionally clean the room was? Well, it was. And so was the bathroom. The room had a tile floor and the bathroom had wood (probably of the faux variety. The bath towel had to be one of the largest bath towels I've had at a hotel as well. Heck, not just at a hotel, my bath towels are no where near that big. It was more like a beach towel and good quality too, not a cheap towel which you might expect for the price. Oh, the room had a mini bar (min fridge with water, soda, beer, etc. The prices were not bad actually, definitely not bad for a hotel mini-fridge. There is a small grocery store a few feet away though, and you can get everything cheaper there. The room was cleaned daily. Fortunately the cleaners didn't hit that floor until the early afternoon, but even when they were there before I got up I didn't hear them. And the one day I woke up after they were finished with my floor, they cleaned the room after I left (which I think was around 1:30 in the afternoon). I half expected to return that day with the room not cleaned but was pleasantly surprised. My only complaint about the cleaning service is that they didn't seem to like to leave much soap. When you arrive there's a little box with stuff including a very small bar of soap and a shower gel/shampoo among a few other items. I prefer bar soap over gel, and the gel was kind of watery so you'll pretty much use half a bottle of that for one shower, though they don't seem to be as skimpy with that stuff. I used the bar to wash my hands and take a shower but they didn't leave more until it was barely a sliver and then they only left one. One day, there was just over a sliver and I left it in the shower not the sink, but they didn't leave more. On my way out, I asked if I could get more and they had them at the desk so I said I would get one on my way back but then forgot so shower gel it was that next morning. One other thing about the room which I only noticed twice during my stay, was that I smelled cigarette smoke two nights, I assume it was coming from another room through the vents. It didn't really bother me that much but it was there, not strongly, but it was there. It was a good location, a few blocks from the Metro which gets you everywhere you want to go. Someone mentioned La Latina station but I think the station at Plaza de Toledo was closer, though it is down a slight hill so if it's a problem walking up a hill or you have lots or heavy luggage then La Latina might be better (though it was slightly more complicated getting to the hotel from there). I don't know how far the walk to Sol is, someone mentioned around fifteen minutes, I never walked there from the hotel. I did walk to other areas like Lavapies and Plaza de Santa Ana though and it's not too bad. I might have preferred being closer to the Sol or maybe Chueca area (for going to most of the gay bars), but like I said the Metro gets you there in no time so get a pass (it's well worth it). The Metro does stop running at 2AM, in Spain that is not very late. But a cab ride isn't all that expensive from that area to the hotel. Hope this review is helpful to you, I absolutely recommend this hotel without any hesitation! Like I said before, they actually exceeded my expectations and I would most definitely be glad to stay here again.
