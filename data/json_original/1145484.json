The Deira City Mall is just opposite and offers great shopping and some restaurants. If you want to get to the beaches, you can make use of the free beach shuttle provided by the hotel. It is really convenient. The only negative point to mention would be the bathroom: We had cold water for the first 2 days of our stay.

the room was comfortable we had a tea/coffee facility and a plasma tv, we had a sofa bed which pulled out to to a bed for the little one. the linen was clean and fresh you could tell. room service was good, every morning house keeping would greet us in the corridor, and he would clean and replenish tea/coffee/water and toiletries in the bathroom. i like the idea that the hotel has small messages around the room and bathroom on housekeeping, such as used towels to go ont he bathtub should they need replacing, or a note to leave on the bed if you need the sheets changing etc etc. there is a small washing line in the bathroom so great for drying swimwear out. there isnt a balcony this would have been nice as i felt cooped up at times in the room, but not important. the beds were comfortable. plenty of hot water in shower. there are 3 lifts which work super fast. the breakfast was the best part of our stay. firstly i would like to thank Daya and his excellent team for making our stay and breakfast enjoyable, they offered professional and fast service. the chef Nazar was absolutely BRILLIANT too. he would make any sort of egg dish for you, i always liked the way he presented poached eggs on toast with parsley and would personally come and give it to us on our table. he would be there ready to make amazing omlettes with different fillings, scrabbled or fried eggs. and his timing is perfect.well done. the buffet breakfast was an enormous range of toast, breads, coissants, jams, honey and cakes, biscuits etc etc, there was loads of choice on just this one table. the buffet hot bar always offered sausages, beans, hash browns, grilled huge tomatoes, pancakes, beef slices, and they would change the dishes every few days from mushrooms to other things. there was always hot yummy porridge and an arabian dish foules medames. there was a seperate table with fresh chilled juices, pineapple, orange and apple. also a range of kelloggs cereals and also 3 maybe 4 different types of milk, both hot or cold and chilled water. there was another bar which offered yogurts, cheeses, olives, cucumbers and fresh whole fruit. and there was also a fresh fruit bar, where different choices of chopped fresh melons, pineapple and mixed fruit salad was available. very nice and refreshing. the staff were always asking you if you needed tea/coffee refills or anything else. we were very happy with the staff in Tala restuarant, we only wish we had the time to dine here in the evening as it looked and smelt just as good as breakfast. the food was safe, plentiful and hot food and cold food available for breakfast. i never had to ask for anything to be refilled or had to que for anything. there are alot of business personels here during the early hours of breakfast whereas later there were couples and few families who were staying there. they cater for all and the layout of the room in spacious and comfortable. would have been nice to have a tv with news on, but there was always a choice of soft music on. there is free wifi in the lobby, although we never used it, as i didnt take my phone incase i loose it. i wasnt aware there was a pool, till i noticed afew days later whilst figuring out the lift/floors. the pool is wonderful and there is a seperate one for the children, however i was a little disspointed that the pool heater wasnt working for the remaining 3/4 days which we were there. i would have expected it to be fixed by then, the water was very cold, but the kids still went in for a dip. the pool area is amazingly relaxing and there is a lifeguard and staff for service/drinks and a bar. please bare in mind you have to be covered up to be at the bar, so just sling on a kaftan/shirt/sarong if your in a bikini/shorts. the changing facilities were good on this floor and toilets and showers/lockers were good and there is a nice small but state of art good clean gym. the first few days i heard lots of aircraft flying around, but it wasnt that bad. i actually also enjoyed the prayers of the early hours from the mosque across the road, it wasnt so loud or shockingly startling, but very calm soft voice. i didnt feel that this was a major issue.i did manage to sleep well through this. i did however hear a fair bit of music, and to say we were on the 9th top floor of the building. i wasnt sure where it was coming from but it seemed from below the side alley and i know they had a bar downstairs, but again it wasnt so bad, just that it went on till midnight. i did call reception one evening as i was having issue with the air con, but the recpetionist said its working and didnt really bother to send anyone up to check or help out, which was a little dissapointing. we slept in the room where it did get stuffy without the air con working, on the last day we managed to figure out how to use the thermostat for the air con, which was a little late and annoying! the hotel is situated bang opposite a huge shopping mall. this was very helpful as it had lots of british branding stores as well as uae's own top branded stores. just cross the main road and walk through the car park to get in. there are around 4/5 different currency exchange koisks inside, do shop around as they vary. and theres also a Boots chemist situated on the ground floor for any emergency bits you might need. there is a huge supermarket upstairs called carrefour, if you have kids or want to see a supermarket with difference its worth going to see the huge range and especially the fish bar! there are fast food chains in here if you want to grab something to eat, we only ate here on our fist day as we're not into fast food. but choice of chinese, arabian, mexican, indian, american and fillipino food. the hotel is easily accesable to the metro, which is a 3-4 minute walk down the road, we travelled through this to get everywhere. even though taxi was readily available right outside anytime. taxi's are always driving past so no issues should you need one. the hotel was a fair walk away from the souks which is where we wanted to be, so used metro to get there. there wasnt really much else near the hotel as to see. there is a restaurant downstairs in the hotel and as part of ibis there is a bistro. next door there was a turkish restaurant which we tried. it was a 5 star restaurant, very well decorated and money spent on dining accessories, but the food wasnt 5 star more 3 star, so wouldnt recoemmend spending \u00a360 on. i would definately recommend this hotel to family and friends. it states its a four star but i do think it should be a 5 star. i would love it even more if the hotel had a spa. i would be coming back again. well done team!

We arrived very early in the morning (5am) due to the way Emirates flights are scheduled. Staff were very helpful and allowed us to check-in early (into a different room as ours was still occupied) for the modest sum of 300dhs. Our first room (203) wasn't brilliant as it overlooked a solid brick wall and a nearby mosque which had its first call to prayer at 6am. We weren't quite ready or enthusiastic for this after a 14hr flight. After a couple of hours in the first room staff quickly moved us into our designated room (830). This was a city view and well worth the extra. Being high up and at the end of a corridor, the room was quiet and the view across to Burj Khalifa excellent. We had initial apprehensions about the hotel's location. This was unfounded though as its a 5min walk to the Metro and Deira City Centre Mall is across the road. A note of caution about the Metro though. It goes to most of the places you would want to visit, but not actually right up to them. You still have a bit of travelling by foot, taxi or bus once you get to your stop. Its also closed on a Friday morning. Not helpful if you have something planned. Having said that, taxis's are very cheap and plentiful although their driving can be terrifying. Back to the hotel though, breakfast is excellent with a good choice (no pork products though which is understandable). Wi-Fi is free in the lobby and bar area but not available in the rooms. Internet in the rooms is a cable connection which if I recall correctly was 25dhs an hour which is quite expensive for internet. Downsides are the beds.

Just cross the street - turn left from the hotel, go 100m to the red light crossing, cross the street and go through the parking & you are in the shopping mall, which is significantly cheaper than the hotel - swimming pool is not so huge, but going there between 9 & 10 gives you a lot of free loungers - if you are travelling towards Burj Khalifa and further - then metro is cheaper for you (and usually faster). Turn right from the hotel and 3 minutes walk gets you to the nearest metro station. - taxis: there is plenty & these are CHEAP. Especially if you travel in 3-4 persons, then it is real bargain! - food? get a taxi (10 aed) and go to Al Rigga st - there is plenty to choose for local food. If consierge will offer you restaurants just next building - avoid these: rather expensive & so-so food. - Fun Tours in the shopping mall on the other side of the street - avoid them, as the tours are really crappy + they frauded us by double-charging the cc - still trying to get the money back - internet is free in the lobby - just ask for login & pass at the reception", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cSuperb hotel\u201d", "Author": "vallabhprabhu", "ReviewID": "UR107016375", "Content": "We had been to Duubai in a hot summer month.

The next day got an email saying \"your credit card transaction was not authorized \". I asked my colleague to make a reservation using her credit card and it successfully worked. Replied the hotel that I got my reservation done by my colleague and everything is ok. The next day I got a letter saying that the first transaction wasn't authorized and I replied that I got another reservation for the same quantity of rooms for the same period. The next day I got a similar message and replied in a same manner. The next day one more similar message but this time I wrote to leave me alone and to forget the previous reservation. The next day got again a similar email and again answered and said not to bother me anymore with this issue. After 3 days, during check in I found out that they charged me for the room and haven't received any message from me. I was supposed to forward all the messages to them to proof it. It took me an hour to negotiate with them. The guy on phone (from reservation department) said \"it's our mistake and we deeply apologize for the situation\" and said that will immediately Void the transaction. Then I told him that I need my money back since I was planning to do some shopping. He said, \"your money would be back latest tomorrow evening\". 5 days passed I tried to settle my account for breakfast and I found out that the re is no money on my card. Called the guy from a reservation department and asked what a hell... where is my money, he asked for some time to consult with accounting department. Few hour later I called him back as he didn't call and he said that they could do nothing and my money will be back next week. To cut this in short, They charged me 780$ for nothing, promised to refund in two days, didn't do it even in a week and left me without money in a foreign country. While knowing that I don't have any other money and this all happened because of their mistake.

Situated 5 minutes from the airport it was next to a huge shopping complex yet at the same time felt 'isolated'. The main tourist attractions are a good twenty minutes away by taxi, ie the Burj Khalifa (worlds tallest building), Bhurj Al Arab, Atlantis Palm Hotel etc and there where no restaurants to 'discover' near the hotel. There was plenty in the shopping complex and featured a few westwern favourites including TGI Friday, KFC and of course McDonalds! Eating in a shopping complex is not my idea of holiday cuisine (albeit unplanned holiday cuisine), not even a glass of wine or two helped as alcohol is prohibited in Dubai, except in hotels and after a couple of nights eating here I was ready to see what the hotel had to offer.... Firstly the rooms. Modern, reasonably spacious, flat screen TV's, mini bar and for the businessman a desk to perch the laptop on. The advice most travellers give out is don't use the minibar, instead purchase your drinks (for probably half the price) at a local store and consume them in your room at your leisure. As stated earlier though alcohol is prohibited in Dubai so should you fancy a drink in your room then the minibar or room service is your only viable option and its not cheap..... The hotel has a swimmming pool on the second floor, not a bad size but due to the layout the sunbed space was at a premium. This led to a lot of pre-dawn 'reserving' of beds which was a shame because for a city hotel the pool area was excellent. in fact the lunchtime menu contained some of the best food I had in the entire duration of the holiday and the staff who served it were excellent. Nevertheless being stranded in Dubai didn't seem quite so stressful as you slipped into this great pool to escape the intense heat of the midday sun. After deciding to try the hotel food after a couple of days eating in the shopping complex I was disappointed we hadn't done it from day on. There where two main restaurants, one served an international buffet, the other a French style bistro. We tried both and they didn't disappoint. Had a wonderful steak in the bistro, they made a big fuss of my daughter and the meal was accompanied by a lovely bottle of Australian red, great food and great atmoshere, wished we had never gone to the shopping complex. The last two nights we had the international buffet which was very impressive, some wonderful starters, great mains and tempting puddings made this truly food to remember and had we been paying for this then it would have been certainly money well spent. To sum up, despite the difficult circumstances that led us to spend 6 nights here I would heartliy recommend this hotel to anyone that is in Dubai for a few days or stopping over before continuing their journey, its clean, modern, comfortable and enjoyable....", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNot A Bad Hotel\u201d", "Author": "rc33", "ReviewID": "UR62924315", "Content": "Arrived early from a flight that landed early in the morning however the check-in staff accommodated straight us straight away.

Also, it is close to the metro /subway. 2. The breakfast was great. It included different types of pastries, bread, yogurt, cereal, fresh fruits, made-to-order eggs, grilled vegetables, beef bacon, pancakes, cheeses and cold cuts. Drinks included tea, coffee, orange juice, bottled water and milk 3. The room and the bathroom was a good size. Flat screen tv and new furnitures made our stay very comfortable.

I was really impressed as i had read some reviews there wan't much choice but they had cooked breakfast buffet along with pasteries, fruits, continental breakfast, cereals and a selection of tea/coffee and jucies. The hotel is in a good location for the city sights. Across the road from the hotel is City Centre Mall which is great, plenty of shops, restaurants and a huge supermarket. Also there is a bus station where the tourist bus starts its journey, which is worth getting on if you want to see all the main attractions of the city and also the beach. We also took a walk to creekside park which is really lovely, there is a cable car ride which you can see all over the city in, but when we went the cable car was broken! We took the tourist bus to The Atlantis on the Palm and spent a day at the waterpark there, this was an excellent water park. On the way back from there we stopped off at the Emirates mall and then Dubai mall both worth a look at. We also booked a trip on a desert safari which was fantasic, not for the faint hearted as the drive over the sand dunes is a little hair raising, but once you arrive at the camp in the desert it is a brilliant night.
