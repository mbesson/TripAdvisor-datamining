The only faults I can find are that the climb up to the property with heavy luggage was terrible. If you can live with 5min of difficult heavy lifting, you'll find your stay here quite rewarding. Firstly, they provide free breakfast and air-conditioning, if you settle the bill in cash. The rooms are well-decorated in a rather ornate baroque style. Some may find it gaudy but I find it just nice. Beds were comfortable and the breakfast was fulfilling. Their coffee was great too!

Our room was very, very clean and the bed was super comfortable, one of the best beds of our whole trip. The decor was interesting and very well kept. Our room looked out on the street and the double paned windows worked well keeping out most of the noise. The bathroom was very small and the shower was in the corner with a drain in the floor and a curtain. The location was great, very central and easy when you are dragging luggage from the train station. The neighborhood felt safe enough and there are several places to eat nearby. There is a great grocery store a couple of blocks over.The stairs leading from the street are very steep and dark. I wish they would put some lights in the stairwell.

My girlfriend and I booked this hotel for 3 nights but ended up only staying for a disgusting 2. We expected the bare minimum as we have stayed in many small European hotels in the past. When we arrived we were a little apprehensive: The dark winding staircase up many flights of stairs towards the awkward front door of the hotel was ominious at best. The shared bathroom was actually a laundry room with a hole in the ground and a spicket above for the shower. Next to this odd shower was the toilet and the laundry machines.OK, we said, we knew we were not going to spend much time in the hotel anyway. After a horrible shower, we threw our towels (I guess you could call them that, they were more like large, thin, starchy napkins), on the ground expecting new ones in the morning. The next day, however, we found that instead of replacing our towels, the housekeeper hung them up for another use. Disgusting. What kind of person would hang muddy soiled towels expecting their guests to use them again?We could deal with this, we thought, and we did so by asking for a new set of towels from another housekeeper in the morning. However, I woke up the next morning with a bed bug on my arm (I actually caught it in the act biting my wrist). We went to the woman at the desk and she said, Yes, this is florence, we have bed bugs...that is how it is.We thought this was the final draw and left the hotel.Do NOT stay here unless u want bed bug bites, horrible service, and all this for the price of 70 euros per night for a room without a toilet or shower.", "Date": "Aug 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR583888937", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "GiordanOpp"}, {"Content": "Loved Hotel Abaco My husband and I stayed at Hotel Abaco in early fall 2003 and loved it. As others have noted, it was definately within walking distance of all main sights of Florence. We walked from the train station to the hotel and this was not a problem. It was a bit hard to find, but the guidebook we got the listing from mentioned this, so that was not an issue. The stairs are daunting, but not bad at all if you're backpacking. I think people are silly for trying to carry big, wheeled pieces of luggage anywhere in Italy! Backpacks are the way to go! Our room was on the small side (no bathroom), but cute and had big windows overlooking the side street. Street noise is bad if you leave the windows open (lots of ambulance sounds from the main street nearby), but with the windows closed there was practically no sound at all! We even had a sink and hairdryer in our room, which was nice.

It is a nice little hotel in the centre of Florence just 5 minutes walk away from the Duomo. The location is great as you can walk anywhere you want to go. We stayed in a room with a bathroom which was a bonus!! The window had a great view of the street we were on. Breakfast is included which is the standard breakfast included in Europe of rolls, jam, coffee  juice. But it is completely sufficient to get you started. After reading some other reviews.......Yes, you need to walk up a number of stairs to get there but remember......YOU ARE VISITING ITALY!!! These are old buildings! Many of them don't have elevators. I say, Enjoy it!! This is how we were meant to get to the next floor! Also, Florence is an incredible city!! There is beautiful works of art pretty much around every corner. If not for the stunning sculptures everywhere, the amazing architure and beautiful facades. I felt very safe in Florence walking around at night. It is truly one of my favourite cities in the world!For a better deal on restaurants, consider crossing the Arno. There are some great places and the prices are better than closer to the centre but you can still walk. My advise is to ask the locals where to go. We did and were sent to a great place behind the Bargello. I think it was called Il Gatto e Lupo or something similar. What ever you do, DO NOT go to Trattoria Za Za no matter what all the tourist publications say.

Got it from Frommer's. The rooms seemed cheesy off the website, but I have to say the decor is fitting for Florance. It's located just 1 block from the Duomo which is the center of everything and the train station is within walking distance which is great. One thing that I thought was a little weird is the fact that the shower is free-standing which means the floor is where the water drains, there is no seperate drainage point. Literally, the floor drains your shower water. However, other than that, it's a great place to stay.

This was our second stop on a 2 week trip of Italy in June 2004. I had done a ton of research and landed on Abaco. It was a good choice. The location was great and near almost everything.

The room was just enough, shower was located in the room(which was a bit odd), and the bathroom was down the hall,but we were not in the room much, so that was OK.

However, when we arrived there after travelling all day, we were politely informed by staff that they were fully booked. Confused, I dug out my email confirmation only to discover that Abaco had forwarded on my email to another hotel (La Cupola), without my permission, who had then pasted in my email, and replied confirming the booking. The hotel (La Cupola) was one we hadn't heard of at all. It was pretty run down and grotty, however up till now I was convinced I had booked Abaco! I have since checked the web, and it doesn't appear anywhere, so basically it is exactly what we were trying to avoid! When I questioned staff at Abaco, I was informed it was up to me to check that they had forwarded on my email and that since La Cupola had signed his name, that was my fault. In my other email bookings, various hotels responded by either saying they were fully booked or else recommended other places. Abaco had the further cheek to inform us that the same thing had happened to another couple 'just that morning'.

My wife and I stayed at this wonderful, tiny 5 room hotel twice. The location is tremendos. If Florence were to be compared to Disneyland, it is like staying in a secrete little room above Main St. USA instead of in a standard fare room far off-site. We just walked off the train, down a couple blocks, and there we were right in the middle of it all. On the bad side, you do need to walk up several flights of stairs, the rooms are small and the breakfast needs to be improved. However, the sights, sounds and eating just outside the window are world-class and rather inexpensive. Best of all, by staying here you are helping out a personable hard working man support his family rather than a huge unapreciative coporation.
