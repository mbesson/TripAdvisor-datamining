{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Please, refurbish it! I spent one night there in April 2007. Very close to the airport, Tianyi is an old 4 stars hotel declassed to 3 stars. It has a very wide hall and a large restaurant, but everithing is old and very used. It would need to be fully refurbished. Room 420 is like written up above, it only lacks a safety box, but the wallpaper is shabby, the carpet is spoiled and theese things give the room a dreary look.Weird chinese breakfast: it looks like a chinese lunch; you can forget continental or english breakfast there; may be you can find just some jam and some bread. For the breakfast you pay only 20 RMB (about \u9227? and $2.6) but for coffee you pay 15 RMB more!", "Date": "Sep 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR391985083", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Botman"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d639436-r10005407-Tianyi_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "639436", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
