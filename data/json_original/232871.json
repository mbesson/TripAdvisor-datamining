The hotel was spotlessly clean, and our bed was pleasantly firm but just about filled the room up. This was the first problem - an incredibly small room, which we know is an Italian thing, but we are rating a hotel and can't allow for the fact that Italian rooms are generally small. Ours was tiny and the only window was blocked by a massive steel fire-escape! There were no in-room facilities apart from the obligatory almost empty mini-bar and a TV that had BBC Worldwide as the only English speaking channel. Not that we drank from the mini-bar or watched TV, but the option to do either would have been nice. No tea or coffee facilities in room, but there was no-where to put it so we kind of understand that. The pillows on the bed were ridiculously large and we found it impossible to sleep with them. The bathroom was so small that the door opened against the toilet bowl - to stop it hitting the bowl a round marble stopper had been stuck to the floor, which we kept stubbing out toes on! Not big enough for two people at the same time unless one of you is in the bath! Stand at the sink at your peril and hope that your partner doesn't open the door and smash into your backside! The shower was ok but the shower head was filthy and sprayed in all directions. The air-con worked but we couldn't turn it off or even down - it kept re-setting to maximum cold. Breakfast was frankly a disgrace. The coffee machine was out of action for every day, so the only option (in Italy, of all places) was overcooked coffee from an urn!!!! The scrambled eggs were so salty that I only tried them once, and the rest of it was pretty inedible. Even the orange juice was almost unrecognizable as such. Not good. We got our morning espresso from a cafe around the corner. Not a bad location, very friendly staff, very quiet, spotlessly clean in general, but not somewhere that we would go back to or particularly recommend unless you are on a budget. We do not view this as 4 star hotel, which is it's apparent rating.

A tip for seeing the Colliseum, buy your tickets at the forum entrance rather than at the colliseum, as the queues are less and the 12 Euro ticket entitles you to see the Palantine Hill, Forum, and Colliseum.

Lovely room(405) which overlooked street. 405 is one of their deluxe rooms offering more space for which you pay a premium. We thought it was worth it. Our visit was in celebration of our silver anniversary so we didn't risk a free upgrade on arrival as others have written they managed. Room was well looked after by charming housekeeper, who we saw in corridor and elevator regularly but not once in the week did she disturb us in our room. In our view breakfast suffers unwarranted negative reviews. Agreed, it is the same every morning but the options are wide and you can easily vary what you have each morning within the regular buffet. Our only criticism is the breakfast waiter was unduly reserved. This could also be said of the barman in the evenings. Perhaps there is an undercurrent of reserve-not once were we asked if we'd had a good day or what we had seen. But if you make the effort, so do they, so maybe this is just the professional Italian manner - don't impose on guests unless invited to do so? No doubt many guests will prefer it this way. As for location-it's in a quiet, passably select area. Walkable to Via Veneto, Spanish Steps, Termini, Trevi Fountain etc. Bus route on Via XX Settembre, running parrellel to Bailey's Via Flavia, takes you further afield, directly to Vatican, Colesseum, Forum, river walks etc. Incidentally, not a 'sight' as such but we were knocked out by the charm & history of the old Jewish Ghetto. We ate in good restaurants on Via Flavia, within 100m or less of the hotel, including the impressive Taverna Flavia for our silver anniversary meal. Restaurant prices were reasonable enough. Fantastic gelato from the ice cream factory/cafe round the corner from the hotel kept my wife happy on more than one occasion. One feature we wouldn't recommend for those on a 'special' break is the private airport-hotel transfer. We arranged ours through Bailey's front desk at a cost of Eur65 from airport/Eur55 to airport and it was just a standard people carrier similar to many of the taxis. We expected an upmarket Merc saloon or similar. We honestly couldn't differentiate between this service and just ordering a taxi.

They were not as \"touristy\" as in other areas near hotels and the food was delicious. There is also a great gelato shop about a block from the hotel. Our flight home was very early so the staff prepared us a box breakfast to eat before we left town and even had 2 cups of cappicino for us at the desk when we check out! How delighful!! The room was nice. Lots of hot water, towels and incidentals. We were next to the slow elevator. Very little sound from anywhere came into our room.

On both counts, the hotel did not fail to meet our expectations. In terms of location, the hotel is a very short walk from Termini station and very easy to find. Perhaps as importantly, the street on which it is located is quiet (yet just off the main road) and blessed with two excellent and reasonbly priced restaurants. There is also a \"locals\" supermarket. From the hotel to the Trevi Fountain is a ten minute walk and to the Roman Forum area is about a twenty minute walk. We also walked to the Vatican, though that took about an hour. On our arrival and during our stay, the staff could not have been more helpful. We were made very welcome. We were told where we were in relation to the main sights, how to get around, where to eat ... and about the Roma City tax we would have to pay on departure!! (The travel agents keep this one quiet!) The breakfast was surprisingly good for a continental hotel: srumptious scrambled egg and an an assortment of meats and breads. Even the coffee machine produced excellent coffee. My only gripes here are that there was just one coffee machine serving up to 20 people and, more sinful, on one morning the milk was made from a powder! Our room was very clean and tidy, and nicely decorated. The most dissappointing aspect to the hotel, though had to be the fact that our \"window\" could not be opened and looked onto an external stairwell. The upshot is that the room benefitted from no natural light. Before dressing for the day, it was impossible to tell if the sun was shining or not! On the plus side again , I have rarely been to a hotel with as much constant running hot water. That was awesome! Shame the bath was a tad small to properly enjoy it, but I think that is the nature of a mid market city hotel so I can not grumble!

Secondly I paid for wifi and spent hours trying to get a connection in the room without success (non existent signal) but they did refund this when checking out without me even mentioning it so there may have been a technical problem they were aware of.

Also without asking we were given a room upgrade. We were also given a free 60 minutes Wi-Fi connection which should have cost 3 euros. Unfortunately we couldn't actually connect to the Wi-Fi in our room, but that didn't matter too much as we could access the internet by using our laptop in the bar. As for the room itself, it was tastefully and sumptiously decorated. We had a lovely big , marble clad bathroom that was equipped with all the things you would expect from a four star hotel e.g. lovely towels, big bathrobes and nice toiletries. The room was also meticulously clean. There was also access to Sky TV and a good range of pay-per-view television if you wanted it. The bed was quite comfy, though the pillows were a little thin. However our experience of Italian hotels is that ALL the pillows are thin! The air conditioning worked well but as with all these things, it was a little noisy. The room also had a small safe in the wardrobe that was locked with a key as opposed to the normal 'credit card' type. Breakfast was really good with a good continental breakfast selection. Plenty to keep you going for a long day's sightseeing. The breakfast room was tastefully decorated, and not cramped with plenty of tables available at any one time. Again, a refreshing change from some of the other hotels we stayed in. This location of this hotel is very good. It's within walking distance of some of the main sites in Rome. More importantly, it's only about a 10 minute walk (with luggage) from the main Train station. It's also only 5 minutes away from local bus stops and on advice we decided to buy a 2 day bus ticket for one of the Hop-on Hop-off sightseeing buses. This was a fantastically easy way to navigate round the city and also see some of the sights we didn't have time to visit whilst we were there. Also close to the hotel are some lovely looking restaurants and a particularly nice cafe. We ate at the Pizzeria at the end of the road and had a delicious salad. Also, directly opposite the hotel is a very nice deli-style shop. Perfect for picking up a selection of cold meats, cheese and bread when restaurant fatigue sets in! The only comment I could make against this hotel was that room service was a little slow, and the menu a bit limited to pizza, pizza and more pizza! However, in the grand scheme of things this was hardly something that would ever prevent me from staying at this hotel again.

The welcome was friendly, our room was not ready but they stored our luggage whilst we went out to see the sights. On our return our luggage was waiting in our rooms for us. OK the rooms are not big, very high ceilings, but no view at all. We paid a cheap rate so we did not expect the Ritz. The bathroom was fine, nice fluffy white towels and great shower above the bath. We had a wonderful dinner at the aforementioned Trattoria Cadrona at Via Raffaele Cadrona - it is right around the corner - you must have their appetizer selection.....you will not be able to eat anything else. After a very comfortable night's sleep we went for breakfast. I seriously think that the previous reviewer must have gone to a different hotel (!) -there was a large selection - at least 4 different sorts of bread, two sorts of croissant, hams, meats, cake, and several juices, and freshly made cappuccino. It was very good. We checked out- again friendly service and set off for our cruise. In summary a good little hotel, away from the tourists, so better value for money in a quiet part of town.

May I state at first that we did not complain openly to the staff. That was not an option on our first visit to this wonderful city an experience which should have included our stay at this hotel. The Gambrinus and the Baileys are owned by the same company. The eloquent fluent Engilsh speaking middle aged male receptionist too fluidly explained upon our arrival at 23.45 that there was a 'water problem' on our floor and they had moved us to a 'more supierior hotel 'and that in his opinion 'the Bailey hotel and our room would be slightly better', they would pay for the taxi and everything would be alright senora and senore. very obliging ,charming ,believable at nearly midnight, so we agreed but didn't really have a choice in the matter as I was not paying at the end of my stay was I ? Last minute .com had payed up ,earned their commission and have since proved that they are not in the slightest bit interested in any of the complaints I raised with them in the form of a return satisfaction email. These were: No assistance with our bags except on leaving one key card only one safe key dark poorly lit room carpet stained and dirty,did they expect us to notice in that light? bathroom showing signs of poor maintenance ie, door stop gone leaving sharp screw like object projecting upwards,(bare feet?!!) chips off bath, poor shower fitting, cramped toilet and bidet arrangement,squeezed in. very noisy hair dryer, very poor sound proofing as I could hear the gentleman above coughing and ...well ..yes.. moving swiftly on The air conditioning was not working .The room was stuffy if on, cold and clammy if off ,there was no happy medium and although I mentioned it and they said they would look at it no person did. Breakfast? an apology for breakfast, I suggest that whoever owns this group of hotels travels to Barcelona ,Prague,Paris Brugge or London as the they will find wholesome fresh breakfasts in hotels that are two and three star. This was an insult to Four star status On Baileys site they state Fresh fruit juice, it was not. It was in fact watered down fruit concentrate cordial . It was dreadful. The rolls I opened were old, certainly not fresh, the worst was the coffee which was granules with boiling water placed in a jug. Remember the British coffee ad with someone making the noise of a coffee percolator? well they didn't even do that ! The whole experience which should have been bordering on Gourmet according to their site was very poor and also extremely cramped. There is no iron and no service provided either . there are no tea/coffee making facilities in our double deluxe room. The ubiquitous mini bar was expensive. I would not trust the freshness of anything. The staff were polite but reluctantly helpful.It appeared that they always were teetering on ending the conversation and turning away to walk back into the office. There were smiles but no happy conversation with their tourist guests. Who do they think is paying their salary. The above unfavourable comments were were mirrored by other guests that we spoke to at breakfast,;there is no lounge area so the only time one meets 'the fellow traveller' is at Breakfast. I will say in their favour that the hotel was clean, the bed was large and comfortable and the linen fresh, the towels were as they state 'fluffy' .....whoopee. Do not go to The Bailey's hotel. We will never book on line with an agency again it leaves you at a distinct disadvantage. When I asked if I could comment about our experience I was told by the smiling receptionist that there was no written system of comment. and no online ability either. So, I am sorry to disagree with others who applaud this place. Our experience was not good.

My husband and I usually stay in 5 star hotels, but we both know what to expect from 4stars too...occasionally 4 stars can be equally good if not better then 5 stars! On this occasion - we were WRONG :( Arrived at the Termini train station and decided to walk the '400 meter' distance...turns out the directions arent exactly clear, so we ended up grabbing a map (7euros) from the train station book shop. Arrived at the hotel - seemed like a pleasant enough neighbourhood - so far so good! The lobby is tiny - no problems with that though (just nothing special to look at at all!).Check in was fine, only got one room key (card) and one safe key. Took the lift (snails pace!) and finally got into the room (502) where the porter couldn't be helpful enough. Looked out the window to look straight into a metal stairwell and another wall opposite...bit disappointed but never mind - was more annoyed that we had no natural light in the room. Lights weren't too bright either! A dark terracotta coloured carpet hid all of the stains...just. Bed was fine/comfy - pillows and sheets sparkly white but not so nice stain on the throw. Bathroom was clean, all marble - very compact though...and a door stop attached to the floor right next to the loo (stumped toes constantly! ouch!) Reception were helpful with directions - but recommended the Taverna flavia (i think that was it's name) which was literally 30seconds walk on the same side of the street at the Baileys...it was a dump! Food was cold, lasagne had been re-heated in a microwave, the shared starter was cold & all deep fried too (not at all fresh). The waiters were using phrases like 'the best' for whatever we seemed to order...obviously they thought that standard of food was acceptable! The next Pizzeria along was great though and seemed to be a popular choice for locals (a good sign!). Huge portions, good atmosphere and amazing food! Breakfast downstairs was a small room - no natural light again but oh well. Buffet style and just an assortment of cakes, rolls, 2 hams, 1 cheese, jams and cereal...ok, its more then what you would usually have to hand in your own kitchen - but for a 4 star? I was expecting more! Fruit juices were watered down - almost like diluting juice, Killer cappuccino though!! Bar? - what bar?! - it again was tiny...not a relaxing area to sit in and enjoy a drink. No music/no atmosphere..and no staff/waiter!? Last day we checked out and spent time wondering around before taking a taxi back to the airport (saved the hassle) which cost 50euros. Had time to freshen up in the Baileys toilets downstairs which were huge! - also very clean. Tips - book ahead if you plan to see the Colloseum and the Vatican - we booked the Vatican tour with www.myvaticantour.com.. about 80GBP, but got to skip the que, had a lovely american lady who was very knowledgable. Only que we had to join was the security line - about a 10 minute wait. It was the group tour and lasted about 2.5/3 hours...very good! Rome is beautiful, and we felt very safe walking back to the hotel after nights out. I guess with all major cities you get your pick-pocketers/beggars etc - so just be on your guard. If you like to walk and feel that hotels are just somewhere to throw your luggage whilst you explore, the Baileys maybe for you. If on the other hand - you like to walk and ejoy the comfort (and glamour) or a nice hotel - dont stay here!

Bailey's obviously does the bait and switch a lot because when my traveling partner was passing through the lobby later that same day another set of guests were checking in who had also received the \"people in your room got robbed\" story (they were talking about it to one another and she overheard them as she left the Gambrinus' lobby). In closing, Hotel Gambrinus Roma was fine. The room was a little worn, but lavishly decorated (some people might call it gawdy). It had a sitting room adjacent to the bedroom--which might have been an upgrade from the standard room we booked. Who knows. So, go ahead and reserve a room at the Bailey's... Just don't be too surprised if you don't end up staying there.", "Date": "March 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Croydon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but nothing special\u201d", "Author": "Robert W", "ReviewID": "UR13811446", "Content": "My partner and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at The Bailey's and I would sum it up as per the title.

Breakfast was OK (echo the comments about the watered down fruit juice - I watched the waiter pour a two litre bottle of spring water into it) but nothing to be excited about. There is a bar but it's opening hours are a bit luck of the draw. We got back one evening about 23:00 and couldn't get a drink. Resorted to the mini bar instead (not too expensive) but not the same as sitting in the bar for a nightcap. Some good resaurants nearby (Taverna Flavia was excellent) but I'd recommend heading to the area around Piazza Navona, Trevi Foutain, Spanish Steps or Piazza del Popolo where there is much more going on. Also recommend the open top bus tour - but make sure you make a reservation - we didn't and missed out a bit.

Staff are fairly helpful and friendly and will call a taxi or point you in the direction of a local restaurant. They all speak english if like us your Italian is not good and provide a map on arrival circling the main attractions which was appreciated! Air conditioning in rooms. Robes provided . Some snacks provided in a drawer (although they were melted when we arrived as the air conditioning was not on) Cons A standard room is very tiny - I guess this must be usual in Rome and you get what you pay for but would advise getting a bigger one as it felt very claustrophobic, there was a view from the small window of the back stairs and a door leading outside was often left open blocking the window. If you are pregnant or overweight you will find it difficult to get into the shower in the standard room as doors are partially blocked by the sink. Very small, slow lift Mini fridge did not keep drinks cool and bar downstairs closed early Safe also very small Shower only in the bathroom but bath foam provided rather than shower gel which I found odd! Location not spectacular - it is fairly close to the Termini station and I would advise going there to get on the 110 red tourist hop on hop off bus to get your bearings. I would not look for the tourist buses advertised in the leaflets at reception as they were impossible to find for us, and you will not find as many in the city as regularly.

The housekeeping staff do an excellent job and the room and bathroom are extremely clean and in good decorative order as is the rest of the hotel. The hotel is located in a quite side street and we were never disturbed by any noise, the hotel is pretty well soundproofed. The breakfast room is very clean and there is the usual selection of juices, pastries, cheeses, cold meats, tea & coffee etc, they will provide hot items but there is an extra charge. The staff at the hotel are all very friendly and helpful, the team on the reception recommended some excellent nearby restaurants and these include: La Pentolacchia, very stylish, excellent food and service, meal for two including botlle of wine approx \u00a360.00 La Vincenzo, top quality fish speciality restaurant, this was also very good and a meal for two including wine approx \u00a350,00 il Pomodorino, this restuarant is huge and the range of food equally vast, good food and good service, meal for two with wine approx \u00a350,00 The quality and value of these restaurants is far better than the U.K equivalent and you will not be disappointed with any of them. The Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and other tourist attractions are within a 15 minute walk of the hotel, the Colliseum 30 minutes and the Vatican about 45 mins. You can buy a ticket for the open top tour bus which is valid for 24 hours and can hop on and off the bus as often as you wish and this is quite a good way to get around, the metro is also very cheap and you can travel on this for as little as 1 euro. When you visit the Vatican the queue to the entrance can stretch for several hundred yards, when you are in this queue you will be approached by people offering you a tour guide service, as the entrance for guided tours is sperate and virtually free of any queue this is a very temping offer, do not go with these people, they do not have access to the fast track official tour guide entrance and after paying 37 euro each at their office across the road you will end up in the same queue you were already in and be no better off. We did a great deal of walking around the city even late at night and felt very safe as there is such a visible police presence everywhere and there also seems to be a police station on just about every block. The only problem you may have is with the gypsies that will approach you holding up a piece of cardboard and try to push this up towards your face, this is an attempt to block your view while they pick your pocket, DO NOT let them even get close to you, push them away with as much force as needed. There are also hawkers that will walk up and try and place items in your hands, just tell them firmly no and they will move on We booked our transport from the airport to the hotel with a company called \"Jimmytour\" and they were excellent, the driver was smartly suited and waiting for us in the arrivals hall, the car was a beautiful E class Mercedes and he gave us a good deal of useful info en-route and he was also a very good driver, we booked him for our return jouney and will also use them again when we return to Rome..

Fom this point the hotel is 10 to 15 minutes walk. The hotel is on a road parallel to the 'Via XX Settembre\". Via Flavia is quiet with a mixture of Hotels Restaurants and small businesses. Baileys is a small hotel but is well appointed and nicely decorated, our room was larger than we had been led to expect for Rome. The service provided in all aspects of the hotel was exemplary. Whilst one expects the hotel to act on any problems you may point out, I was surprised when I noticed one of the light bulbs in our room was out as we left for a walk to the coliseum one morning, on our return the bulb had been replaced without us mentioning it at all! It shows the sort of care taken by all the staff. The breakfast buffet was nicely presented with a sufficient choice to accommodate our tastes. We found the hotel to be convenient for the major sites and although in Rome you should expect to have to walk we found the routes enjoyable and not too strenuous.

Once you get your bearings within a day or so you'd see and understand how close you are to these places. If you need help definitely ask Simona at the front desk. Simona will send you on your way which will be just right. Go on a tour to Florence. Highly recommended. The hotel atmosphere wasn't grand but just right. Room was comfortable enough for two ( not that you'd want to stay inside with all to see) and the bathroom was always clean. The breakfast was astonishing. Great service! and Excellent coffee (American). Must wake up early enough to taste the fresh eggs! At night if you're hungry from walking and shopping all day,across the street from Bailey's hotel exiting left a block away, try theGreek food from Mythos, or the assorted food from the snack shop in front of the Newsstand. Make sure you don't buy from the snack shops near the tourist areas, they tend to overcharge, ie. 3,95 for 1 warm Coke or ask how much before you sit down. Over all Bailey's hotel was exactly what we needed not too much and not to little. With excellent service and no complaints!

We spent four nights there in early November. The hotel staff were very welcoming and were only too pleased to provide us with advice on places to see and make recommendations for restaurants etc. The room was clean but rather garishly decorated. It had very atmospheric subdued lighting which was fine except that it made identifying the contents of one's suitcase at night a bit difficult ! Breakfast was served in a rather small but adequate room. A good range of the usual cold buffet items was provided. A nice touch which pleased us as English tea drinkers was the provision of a reasonable sized teapot to allow the beverage to infuse - unlike the sad \"teabag in the cup scenario \"which is found frequently in many continental hotels. Unfortunately the hotel's accounting system is not too efficient . Upon our departure we were billed for extras ( a hot breakfast and items from the minibar) which we had not consumed.

(no bath, just shower) The room was quiet and comfortable, exactly what you need after a days sightseeing. Breakfast was served in a basement area which was bright and cheerful although there was no natural light. The breakfast was fairly standard cereal, bread, ham, cheese, fruit and yoghurt, perfectly adequate to start the day. The hotel is located in a quiet residential street just off the Via XX Septembre, all the main tourist sites (Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Forum etc) are within walking distance apart from the Vatican which can be reached by bus from the Termini. We got restaurant recommendations from the hotel staff but to be honest the restaurants we found ourselves were probably better. There are about 6 good restaurants within 5 mins of the hotel. In particular one on the same street about 200m if you turn right going out the front door. (Sorry name escapes me but the best tiramisu ever!) The hotel staff were polite and efficient, however if you are used to the fake Holiday Inn style, 'Have a nice Day' then you will be dissappointed, however I found this quite refreshing. The only very minor complaint would be that one day housekeeping didn't make it until 4pm, however they appeared when we went out for dinner at 8 and cleaned then.

The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, offering very useful information to visitors such as the best transport options around the city. A nice touch is a complimentary bowl of fresh fruit in your room on arrival. For an overview of the city, we recommend the Red \u201c110 open\u201d bus with stops at all of Rome\u2019s popular sights (good value at 13 Euros for a \u201chop off \u2013 hop on\u201d all day ticket including an evening service to view the illuminated city by night). Most of the sights are within walking distance of the hotel (except perhaps the Vatican, which is reachable on the 62 or 64 (?) bus from a stop on nearby Via XX September). The hotel\u2019s inclusive continental breakfast was a welcome start to each day. For evening meals, there is a good choice of family run restaurants in the immediate district (on or just off Via Flavia) offering excellent traditional menus. Two particularly recommended restaurants are \u201cLa Lampada\u201d and \u201cHenry Cow\u201d (just along from the hotel). Due to its location, The Bailey\u2019s Hotel offers a good quiet nights sleep and in very comfortable beds. The bathrooms are in traditional marble style with powerful showers! The one slightly negative point is the absence of coffee / tea making facilities in the rooms (although this appears to be standard in mainland Europe). On the whole a very pleasant and comfortable hotel, ideal for a short break in a vibrant city!", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Berlin, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cviva Hotel Bailey\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4373748", "Content": "I very recently spent a week in Rome and had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Bailey.

It began with a cheerful and helpful staff, especially Simona. There were three of us to a room, one Double and one Single bed and still enough room for 6 extra large suitcases. All of our luggage was taken to our room immediately upon arrival. The room was exquisite, the fruit basket was fabulous and refreshing. The Bathroom had all the amenities. The complimentary breakfasts were outstanding. The assortment of fresh fruits, pies, breads, meats, etc. were fantastic. Everything you could think of and more. The staff was pleasant and extremely helpful and I might add although we spoke Italian there English was great. They had all the answers to our questions. They had maps available, information on local shops, etc. They took care of our taxi and airport reservations. They informed us of the rates so that we would not overpay. I could go on and on. Quite a fantastic experience. We spent 30 days in Italy and 4 of the best days were at the Bailey's Hotel. I might add that our room rate was very reasonable at $170.00 per night (3 Persons). Thank you! I hope to return soon.

The room was amply spacious, beautifully decorated and absolutely immaculate. Watch out for the pricey snacks in the mini bar though! Breakfast was outstanding and the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is a little further away from Termini station than they let on on the Baileys hotel website, but that's probably because it can take you 10 minutes to find your way out of the station onto the correct street exit! To be honest, it's a good 20 minute walk from the time you set foot off the train to the hotel (travelling with luggage and if you know where you're going!). Be very careful of the taxi drivers outside the station - some of them are real pirates and wanted to charge us 40 euros for a five minute journey (which should ordinarily cost 5-10 euros maximum). Fortunately we were well informed about the hotel location so knew they were trying to rip us off.
