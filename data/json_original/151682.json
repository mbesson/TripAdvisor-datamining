There is a great supermarket directly across the street if you like to make your own food or simply want some variety. There are some great local restaurants within walking distance and they have sister resorts on the beach which allow you to use the facilities. For those who simply like to relax in peace and quiet, they have a small atrium with hot-tub and pool area which is a great place to just chill out and read. The bathrooms are small and completely glass. While we liked the uniqueness of them, I prefer a real bathroom with walls and a door because you feel like you're showering in the same room as all the people you are travelling with. We also stayed at the Caribe Hilton for roughly the same price and preferred it over the doubletree if you are staying in San Juan for an extended stay.

We stayed in two different rooms there (due to extending our stay because of work). The first room was VERY tiny. Two people and 4 bags of luggage do not fit well in it. The second room, they had to put us in a smoking room by the pool because they were overbooked. These rooms are HUGE and I overlooked the smell of smoke because of it (the staff offered to use a machine that would remove the smell, but I was exhausted from hiking and didnt want to vacate for an hour to use the machine). The only small complaint I had about the hotel is roomservice trays will stay in the same spot in the halls for more than a day. Also we ordered roomservice once and they forgot half our order and then re-charged us the delivery fee for bringing up the remaining items, then it took 20 minutes at check out to get it removed. The doors are also paper thin and housekeeping will wake you up in the morning chitchatting with each other. Little tidbit that isnt advertised very well there: they have self serve washers and dryers behind the showers at the pool!!!!! The staff at the Doubletree for the most part is very helpful and nice.

We also enjoyed dinner one evening at Fleria Greek Restaurant which was about 2 blocks further than Bebo's. Tiny place. The owner presented the bill of fare on a white board explaining each item to us. The meal was terrific and the pricing was quite reasonable. I recommend both places. We were interested in seeing El Yunque, the rain forest. We booked the tour through the hotel front desk. $20 deposit and the balance to the tour guide in the morning. No question that we were a little worried about how this might turn out. However, the tour through E&B Tours and transportation was really good. Our guide, Joey was knowledgeable and well-spoken. We stopped along the road on the way back and had a light lunch at a local place. Nothing special but it wasn't too bad. The beer was ice cold! Everyone on the tour agreed that it was a good value.

Most reviews were accurate. Hotel is 1/2 mile walk to beach and they will give you letter to use La Concha Resort on beach. No shuttle and taxi ride is would be $20-25 round trip. I knew this before I selected this hotel. I more interested in getting a clean hotel, good beds and car self-parking. I used this hotel as place to sleep, because most of time I was out touring the Island. There is so much to see in Puerto Rico. You rain forest, beautiful islands and beaches, and Forts in Old San Juan. I am not one to sit around the resort. I visited La Concha on beach, and I did not like this place. It did not feel like resort, more like dentist office with a small pool and just few chairs (little privacy/no trees, you look up all you see 100+ room looking directly down on pool). Down a few blocks was Marriot on Beach; now, this place seemed like a real family resort, big pool and lots of chairs. If I was resort type I would check out Marriot or Caribi Hilton. Doutbletree Service was okay, but not very friendly. Mostly desk clerks that are only interested in check you in & out. So don't expect to find hotel concierges waiting to answer your questions and make dinning recommendations. If stay at Doubletree in San Juan your on you own. Do your research on restaurants and attractions before you go to Puerto Rico. Site called \"Puerto Rico Day Trips\" is very good. Doubletree rooms were clean, but as other have said bathrooms are strange. As other have commented, I found the frosted door a bit strange. Although, I thought the frosted door was sufficient enough for privacy, but other are right you see shadow movements. My problem was shower area is so tight and door opens into the shower, not out; so stubbed my toe trying get arround the door and out of shower area. Door to Shower should open out, not in. Self-Parking was $15 day and valet was $20. I avoid valet parking to save a little money, time and tips. Self-parking was pretty easy, but I wish they would give you pass for whole stay, because you have to get each day's parking ticket validated by hotel desk. So each night when returning to the hotel, you have to get the front desk to validate (stamp) the parking ticket to give garage cashier when exit next day.

We stayed first for 6 nights while we explored the mainland, then one night at the end before our flight back home early in the morning. We highly enjoyed our stay here and were happy to get back \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to this hotel again after Vieques. As others have said, the location is not on the beach but about a 10 minute walk. It is about a 15 minute walk to the happening area of Ashford Ave with lots of bars and restaurants. This location suited us fine as we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind lots of walking and we are not huge beach-goers. About the only downside we could find with this hotel is that it is about 5 miles to the center of Old Town and a taxi costs $15. The bus is very cheap ($0.75-you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need exact change) but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to run very often (we waited about 20-30 minutes). The front desk told us to catch the bus across the street from the Shell station on the corner. This bus went out of it's way to the convention center (at the Sheraton Hotel) and took about 40 minutes. We later discovered you can take the number 5 bus into Old Town and save about 15 minutes. You catch this bus across the street from the hotel in front of the grocery store (not in front of the Shell station). We found the room to be very comfortable and quiet. We had a room with a queen bed with garden/pool view which also came with a murphy bed. The room was large and had plenty of storage space....lots of drawers and closet space for unpacking. They provided 2 bottles of water everyday which was a nice touch. Wi-fi was free (and fast). There was a mini-fridge, coffee and coffee maker, iron, ironing board, full-size hair dryer, safe, and mp3 player/clock radio. The bed and pillows were comfortable. Plenty of hot water in the shower. As some have noted, some of the rooms must slant a bit as the water from the shower will seep out into the main bathroom area. Our room during our second stay did not do this. The staff was always helpful and friendly and provided yummy chocolate cookies every night when we came back from our day out (another nice touch!) There is a fitness center with 4 treadmills, a couple of ellipticals and one bike and assorted dumbbells and other accessory equipment. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on that. We did not find out until the very last night of our trip about the arrangement they have with their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sister\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hotel La Concha for use of their pool facilities and access to their beach. They will give you a letter to take with you. But apparently you have to ask about it (or maybe they just forgot to tell us upon check-in). Overall, we would highly recommend this hotel. It is not cheap (we paid $218 per night including tax -AAA rate), but there do not seem to be any comparable places that are cheap in San Juan. Yes, you can find a condo on VRBO or similar, or stay at a lower-end B&B or 3 stars-or-less hotel for less money. But for something this nice we found it to be a great choice!

My room had a queen bed and a murphy bed, which I didn't need, but would be helpful if family was with me. The room was kind of small, but this is a city and space is valuable. The bed was very comfortable and the bedroom and bathroom were extremely clean. There was a good selection of channels on tv. The wireless internet service worked like a charm. Towels were plush and thirsty. The only complaint about the bathroom is how the shower floor and bathroom floor are at the same level and water can get out of the shower stall into the bathroom. I had to use a towel to mop it up. The courtyard, pool, hot tub, oversized chess board area was very nice. One of the best things is that the pool and hot tube are available 24 hours a day! The pool is very good sized and the hot tub was actually hot. Lots of chairs and lounges, even a couch and chairs conversation pit. Yes, there is a huge outdoor chessboard with almost life-size pieces. I ate breakfast each morning at the buffet - it was good and there is an omelet chef. For dinners, I went to area restaurants (Orozcos, Cafe del Angel - I will be writing reviews) to get more of the local flavor. It is about a 5-10 minute walk to the beach and they have free \"beach kits\" at the front desk, but I don't know what is in them. No, it's not directly on the beach, but it cost less to stay here. The few blocks around the hotel are iffy at night, but if you walk up the adjacent street to Ashford Avenue, you will be fine. At worst, take a cab up to the tourist area on Ashford.

We had requested a room with a balcony and were surprised to learn that our balcony was on the ground floor with direct access to the pool. We were a little worried by this but it proved to be great, actually. The sliding glass door is nearly soundproof and the pool wasn't all that crowded. The pool area itself is beautiful, perfect lighting, great background music, a waterfall, and a great hot tub. This area would be great for hosting a gathering like a wedding or some other big event. The porch/patio has some bit of privacy from the pool, but it is not completely blocked off with a gate or anything...we had no problem with this, but if you want more privacy, this probably won't work for you. The accomodations are very nice and updated, very clean and fresh feeling. The bed was nice and big...and comfortable.

The room was beautiful and the beds so comfortable. Go across the street to the supermarket and get provisions (including alcohol) and you can have everything to make your stay comfortable. We did have the breakfast buffet every day with made to order eggs, omelettes, and a vast variety of meats, cheeses, fruits, breads, etc. Coffee was available in the lobby until 10 am every morning. The staff at the front desk took care of everything - we needed large bills cashed, bandaids, water, more cookies, and they even found a pair of shoes left out on our room porch overnight. I can't say enough about these people. Taxis to casinos and other venues were about $10, to the airport about $18 (including bag charges). Only caveat, drinks at the beautiful bar were approx $10 each (but good drinks), and the food menu at the pool was high. If that's the worst you can say about a place, you really are in heaven. Although it is not on a beach, this hotel provides complimentary use of the amenities at 2 of their sister properties where there is a beach and casino.

We stayed here on both ends of our cruise. If possible, get a room with a balcony by the pool/hottub courtyard area on the main level. Great for lounging or swimming (though it is a small-ish pool) or resting in the hot tub. This is a lovely courtyard where you can relax on your computer (wi-fi throughout the hotel) or just sun yourself. The hotel is not on the beach but is within walking distance (10 minutes) to Condado Beach. Also, the hotel has two \"sister hotels\" on the beach - La Concha on Condado Beach and the Marriott Courtyard on Isla Verde Beach. We visited both, and it is great to be able spend an afternoon at the beach and by the pool there even though we were staying at the Doubletree. Ask the helpful concierge desk about walking to Condado Beach, but basically you walk a few blocks down De Diego to Ashford. Turn right to the local park where you can access the beach. The day we were there, this was a quiet area of beach, apparently mostly for locals. But the sand is grainy and not soft on the feet. However, if you turn left instead of right when you get to Ashford from De Diego and walk a few blocks (15 minutes or so) to the hotel zone on Condado Beach, you will find the sand is soft and golden. However, the day we were there the waves were pretty strong, carrying in seaweed in spots, making this not the best swimming area on the island. However, there is a cove near Park La Ventana al Mar bordering the Renaissance La Concha Hotel (the Doubletree's sister hotel). There is a nice small protected beach behind the La Concha and alongside the park, which has a beautiful collection of Palm trees spread throughout the sandy soil. Be sure to walk out on cement pier that takes you across the beach for beautiful views of beaches to both the east and west. If you want to go to the Marriott Courtyard on Isla Verde, it is about a $15 cab ride, but it is a very nice hotel on a great beach location, with signature Marriott resort-style pool. The only downside here is that the airport runway is right behind the hotel, so be prepared for some screaming jet engine sounds while you're sitting by the pool. Overall, I highly recommend the Doubletree. Oh, also, there is a grocery store across the street, which was very convenient. I have posted more information and photos of Condado Beach and Isla Verde Beach on BeachManiac.com. And if you have time, be sure to visit Old San Juan (a $15 cab ride). It is way more interesting that the immediate area around the Doubletree (which is kind of blah). Old San Juan has very interesting the forts, shops, restaurants, etc., and take a walk along the promenade below the wall that surrounds the city (but beware that there apparently is no exit at the end so don't go too far, you have to walk back too.)", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seaford, Delaware", "Title": "\u201cGood location...

I am so glad I chose the Doubletree. Below is my unbiased review of the property, surroundings, services. Duration 3 nights over weekend Getting to the hotel from the airport can be a little tricky especially if you miss the exit. But most exits come quickly so pay attention. With a GPS, you will make it there fine. Property: The Doubletree shares the corner block with two high rise condo...hence the parking will be shared as well (more on that in a bit). The hotel lobby area was very clean and staff were everywhere to help your every need. Very nice and welcoming. Upon entering the inside was modern and very comforting. However, the smaller front desk is not easily visible from the main entrance sliding door...but rather around the corner on the left then right. Check in was quick and easy. In less than 5-10 min I was up in my room. I was lucky to get on the 8th floor (top) facing the street...here you can get a partial view of ocean, grocery store, pool below, and other apartment buildings. The other side faces the condos and residential houses. Room: I got the single queen room...as I was traveling alone. It was very nice, professional looking, and comforting, but a little on the small size (maybe 12x20) - it didnt feel crammed though. The bed was extremely comfortable with 4 soft pillows, down comfortor, and thick padded headboard. Even the bed skirt was nice and clean. This room will accommodate any picky business traveler. Bathroom: This was modern as well, with LOTS of glass (doors, walls). The shower is all tile. Water pressure was good, hot water abundant. Everything was provided. Very nice. Side note: On the two of the nights, house keeping tends to forget something each day. On the first day, no face or medium towels (only 3 bath towels). Was provided at next cleaning. The next day, got missing towels, but forgot water (two complimentary bottled water) and coffee creamer. Minor details, but I am very observant and will note everything in my reviews. Facilities: The pool and hot tub are was nice...though I didn't use them, I took a little tour around the place. The landscape and layout and lighting was nice and soothing. The workout room was near in a separate room, with lots of equipment. Strange Observation: Every day as I was coming and going there seems to the homeless man in a wheelchair hanging around the front entrance and often in the bar/lounge. He didn't smell good...old urine smell. Every time, i've seen this person, the staff did nothing...and even saw the bar folks giving him drinks while having dinner at the on-premise restaurant. I really felt uncomfortable and don't feel this is a good visual to have to this caliber of hotel. Though he didn't pan-handle or bothered anyone, you had to make an effort to make your was around him...and the smell. yuck", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakeland, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery Comfortable but you'll $$$pay$$$\u201d", "Author": "jsmcolegio", "ReviewID": "UR124244117", "Content": "I've been in many hotels around the world and most of them when you have a special situation that includes unexpected hardships they will work with you on pricing specially if you are arriving @ 4am.

I stayed at this property in May for a business conference. I was looking forward to my stay as I had never been in Puerto Rico. I had images from travel brochures of a tropical island paradise i.e. ocean view ,lush vegetation and old world charm and definately different from the upper midwest, so I was excited. The Hilton was unfortanately situated no where near water, scenary or anything picturesque (sp)nor was there easy access to beaches which I was lead to believe were \"nearby\". This Hilton had a sister property located on the beach,which as a Hilton guest I was told allowed beach priveleges. When I called the Hilton to ask about this, I was lead to believe this sister property and beach were very \"close\". As a single female traveler I always am aware of safety issues so I don't wander too far by foot especially after dark. This property was located in more of a city, residential area with , as far as I could determine, few sites, resturants, shops of interest(for the traveler) nearby. A fellow conference goer and myself went to check out the beach at this sister property. We walked for neary 45 minutes to get there! Unfortunaelty in San Juan all taxi service has set prices and even a short city block juant in this part of town costs $10 so it can be quite expensive to explore the area by taxi. I never did get to see the beach as when our meetings were over at 4:00 a walk there would bring us there after dark. (Note: I asked the Hilton whether since this was a \"sister\" property there was a courtesy shuttle to take us there...the answer...\"No\".) Hence, the only water I saw was when I arrived one day early and stayed in Old Town for the sites (I recommend this area for attractions if you have a short stay). The hotel itself was Ok, nice but unremarkable. The conference rooms were dark (with dim lights) and cramped. When we had a break there was little nearby to explore. The rooms were clean (as I would expect), but it seemed the decorator had gone overboard in the modern look. For example in the bathroom, there was a freestanding sink with no counter to lay out toiletries (quite an inconvience). There was nowhere to hang things in the bathroom. There was some weird ladderlike shelf where the towels were shelved. It was a shared room and the one double bed was about 2 feet from the slidding bathroom door (glass) which didn't close fully so it was impossible to fully have privacy in the bathroom. The amenities were Ok. The resturant was on the way to the conference rooms (which were past the garage entrance) which you needed to walk to on the other side of the building. The resturant was kind of dark and ugly. It seemed as if it were part of the garage with a cement ceiling. Although it was open air, I definately found the atmosphere unpleasant and didn't even want to sit in there as there was little sunlight. As a summary, this was a nuts and bolts hotel i.e. clean and if you only had to stay one or two nights for business OK , but not if you want to explore and feel the atmosphere of Puerto Rico.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Biella, Italy", "Title": "\u201cGreat confort\u201d", "Author": "eugeita", "ReviewID": "UR123384529", "Content": "Modern hotel, with a super staff, Mr Antonio over all (he kindly helped me to organize a visit to a rum distillery).

It's not on the beach or in Old San Juan, so you do need to walk a ways or drive to most attractions.

Location: it is not where \"all the action\" is, so if you want to be in the center of the hustle and bustle you may opt for another location HOWEVER it is within walking distance to get to any eatery or shopping-within .50 mile. There is a grocery store right across the street which was really convienent to get basic bottled water and drinks.

Anytime I asked for help or towels they were happy to offer assistance. Room: it was clean and very modern furniture. It had a microwave, hairdryer, mini fridge, etc. One negative(and certainly not a big deal) was the maid left some food and stuff from previous guest...again, not a big deal. Another negative was that the walls were slightly \"thin\" I could hear the neighbors opening and closing the bathroom doors. They are heavy type material made of glass and they slide. It wasn't enough to keep me up at night. I am also use to sleeping with a \"noise fan\"-and we didn't have one of those to drown out the noises. Again, these negatives were not bad enough to keep me from staying at this hotel in the future. We used the fitness center and pool area; both were small but nice-served its purpose. We ate breakfast there every morning because we had vouchers. It was good. They had eggs, potatoes, fruits, omlets, bread, sausage, bacon, cereal. One benefit of staying at this hotel is that you get guest priviledges at another hotel and casino. We did spend the day at this other hotel which was located on the beach.

The Ocean Park Beach is a great beach and seems like where the locals hang out, and a little away from the touristy areas as you go along the beach. We also loved going to the Bebos cafe next door.

Rooms are exactly as posted. Per my visit, I noted that this is more of an adult (singles/couples) executive/business style hotel in which everything is within arms reach. It is not a typical touristy hotel which is exactly what I was looking for. I aptly named it \"The Convertible\" as everything nice and in place but without excess. The staff is excellent, and there is a 24 hour grocery store across the street. Also, the hotel food is excellent but a tad bit pricy but the grocery store has tons of choices from alcohol, fresh fruit, to a Boars Head deli. The restaurant adjacent to the hotel provides excellent local cuisine choices at a great value. I would definitely rate it 4+ out of 5! Also, there are few Mom and Pop eateries within 3-5 mins walking distance. The beach is within a 10 minute walk and the hotel will give you a pass for the resort (partner hotel) as required. I did note that I did not see any children ( a plus for me) so if you have little ones, a larger resort style may be best suited for your needs. Pls note on Fri/Sat evening, it can get pretty loud but management mandates and enforces quiet hours after \"11ish\" per my visit. I had read about this issue on Trip Advisor so I knew what to expect and it did not pose an issue for me. Also there is free (yes free) wifi, a free kiosk, safes and a small fridge in the room. A plus for me was also the free happy hour on Wed evening. I would like to see brighter lighting in the bathrooms for shaving. Again, this is a highly recommended hotel. So if you are looking for a nice place with tons of privacy coupled with some nice features within walking distance, this is the place for you. I will stay here again on my next visit in the spring.

The bad: The room we stayed in, Room 801, was a corner room on the top floor. Very nice room but we were surprised at how loud the fans were. The main A/C fan we shut off immediately, but the biggest culprit was the bathroom fan which apparently could not be shut off. This normally wouldn't be a problem except in these rooms the bathroom door is 2 ft from the bed and made of glass - makes for loud bathrooms. We phoned to ask if the bathroom fan could be shut off or if it was 'just that way'. The front desk said that they had to check with maintenance and they'd call us back. We were in the room for 4 hours before going out - no call was made to us. When we came back at night, we phoned around 11pm to ask about the bathroom fan again - they said it was too late to check in to it. I pointed out that I'd phoned earlier about this problem. All I got was a 'sorry, there's nothing we can do now'. The hotel was fully booked. Finally, upon check out, we told the front desk staff the same thing - our room was too noisy.

The beach is about three blocks away and there is a supermarket directly across the street so you can get all your snacks, alcohol and even dinner.

They have a flat rate, this is the only thing I wish I had known or we would have rented a car. Also, club brava is over-rated! Tijuana's restaurant is a little walk but great food!

The hotel is very clean and modern, and the staff is very professional and kind. The hotel is close to restaurants, bakeries, museums, and decent grocery store. The hotel has sent me two surveys to fill out, and the only negative point I've stressed is the quality of the food, at least the room service. I ordered room service during my first stay, which was only a one-night stay. I ordered both dinner and breakfast. For dinner, I ordered filet mignon and fries. The steak was okay, but it was bland. It also could have used a good sear on the sides, in order to develop some flavor and seal in juices, though the steak wasn't too dry, but it had a somewhat rubbery texture. In terms of the portion size, it was a lot of food, but hotel chefs ought to cook more tasty food, especially at the very high price of room service. The cheesecake was okay, not nasty, but not better than the ones I've made myself-I bake for a hobby. Breakfast was disappointing. I ordered the pancakes, which were very small, rubbery, and had a taste that seemed pre-made or made from a mix. Again, I do pancakes at home that come out much better. They do give you a lot of bacon as the side order, though. The tab was quite high for small pancakes of that quality. During my second stay, which was a few nights, I ate no food from the hotel. I ate every day at nearby bakery and at restaurants in Old San Juan. During my next stay, I'll be doing the same because I doubt the quality of the food has improved. However, most important is that the hotel is nice and very comfortable.

The double bed room size was the same size as a single bed so that meant the toilet was literally 5 feet away from the bed. The bathroom had a sliding door rather than a swinging door. And because it was glass, it magnified all the bathroom sounds to an embarrassing volume. Overall, the room was nicely decorated but very small for PR hotels.

I swear I gta order some now just thinking about it. We finally arrived to our room on the 6th floor. The room was not huge but it was very nice and had a modern style.

Next to the hotel was the SuperMax de Diego, a 24hr supermarket for all your needs. If you're gna head over there for food, prepare for a long line, but the food was still delish and very cheap. The hotel was a perfect location for everything... the popular Ashford Ave was only a few blocks away, with all the other restaurants and shopping places nearby. You dont necessarily need a car to get to those places since they were in walking distance. But back to the hotel,.. everytime we walked past an employee, they always said hello or good morning, probably the nicest ppl u'll encounter during this trip. The only complaint I have was that early in the morning around 9-930, a few housekeepers would laugh and joke around next door to us, probably loud enough to wake us up a few times.

Of course I read the many reviews on Trip Advisor and had high expectations. All of these expectations were delivered. We were staying here three days prior to our cruise. This was an excellent way to start our vacation. We arrived before check in time around 12:00. Our room was not ready which I anticipated. Grelisse met me with a smile, warm welcome, and warm cookies. She did a pre-check in for us and arranged for the hotel to store our bags. She said it might be an hour to an hour and a half before the room was ready. Not a problem for us because we went to eat lunch. We took a short stroll to Bebo's (recommended by Trip Advisor:). We enjoyed a tasty lunch and returned to the hotel. It had been about an hour. I went back to check the status of our room and was greeted by Bo. Also, very friendly and welcoming. He said it would be a little longer. We enjoyed more warm cookies from him and decided to look around the hotel a bit and the pool area. The pool area was nice. We found a place on the patio where there was a huge chess set. The pieces are plastic and about 2 feet tall. My son and husband started to play a game. Just as they were finishing, Bo came around to let us know our room was ready. We had only waited maybe 20 minutes more. How wonderful that he took the time to come and look for us. The room we had was great overall. It was modern, clean, effecient, and offered nice ammenities. There was a queen bed that was very comfortable and a murphy bed that pulled out of the wall. My son said it was comfortable as well. The room was not large, but was an efficient use of space and fine for us. In the closet was a safe, microwave, and small fridge. We used all of them with no trouble. 2 bottles of complimentary water were left each day for us. We had enough storage for our clothes between drawers, cubbies, and the closet. Lighting was good too.The bathroom was quite modern as well. I thought it was attractive and functioned well for my family. The housekeeper kept us in fresh towels and our room always looked great when we returned from our days adventures. One minor thing the hotel may want to address is the carpet in the room, it was a bit warn. Enough to be noticeable. I believe this hotel was recently renovated. Not sure if the carpet was replaced. I know carpets get a lot of abuse so it could've been newer but got a lot of traffic. (This wouldn't deter me from returning, just a note for management.) The one curious thing was that the thermostat in our room was set pretty cool so we moved it to 80. (The highest it would go.) It never felt like 80, it was pretty cold, so we called for an extra blanket. Literally, the blanket arrived at our door 5 minutes after I placed the call to housekeeping. That's service! When we would return to our room at the end of the day we'd turn the A/C off and it would warm up, then we'd put it back at 80 and we'd be good for sleeping. (Being from Florida we keep our thermostat 78- 80 most of the time). We never had to wait long for an elevator either. When we would pick up our rental car from the valet, Sammy would always greet us with a smile and familiar recognition. We never waited long for our car either. (Valet parking was included in our package. Highly recommend, because I believe it's $20 a day.) Also, I recommend renting a car (Avis was great) and renting a GPS to get around the island. We drove to Old San Juan, El Yunque, Luquillo, and Fajardo. We had no difficulties getting around. On our first night, Peter at the front desk gave us a wonderful dinner recommendation. (Marisqueria Atlantica-see restaurant review). He was right on the mark about the food, price, ambiance, etc. The hotel lobby has a fabulous chocolate shop. We tried out a few one evening, yum! We also, enjoyed complimentary breakfast at the hotel. (Included in our package) The food was satisfying and helped start our day on the right foot. We never had to wait for a table. They would seat us immediately and then we would help ourselves to their tasty buffet. They had many things to choose from (hard boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, omlettes made to order, bacon, sausage, pancakes, french toast, fresh fruit (usually cateloupe, honeydew, and/or watermelon), cereal, oatmeal, bagels, toast, and english muffins. I may have missed something, but you get the idea. I did not care for their scrambled eggs (hard and dry), so I opted for the omlette made to order which was delicious. Everything else I tried was great. (The scrambled eggs may have been a fluke.) Others ate them and seemed content. The coffee was wonderful too. The only minor thing I wish they had offered were pastries or muffins of some kind. (My son's favorite) Every morning they had complimentary coffee in the lobby which was great! We had some each morning before we came for breakfast. We tried the in room coffee but the lobby's one was much better. I used the business center a few times to retrieve addresses for our GPS and get some info. There were three computers available and a printer. All of which worked great and I didn't have to wait for one to become available. We also borrowed their beach chairs and beach towels that were available to guests. They came in handy at Luquillo beach. (They have a soft sided cooler if you need as well. We had brought our own.) Another nice thing was utilizing the facilities at their sister resort, La Concha. We got a letter from the front desk letting La Concha know we are guests at the Double Tree and that we would be enjoying some time at their facility. We self parked our car at La Concha. ($4.00 first hour, then $3.00 each hour). We enjoyed their infinity pool that looked out on the beach, along with use of their towels and chairs. The front desk was very welcoming to us as well. They set up an account for you so that if you want to charge something you can. Another bonus was the grocery store across the street. We were able to get drinks to take with us when we went out for the day and a much needed rain poncho. We also bought food for dinner one night. I utilized the microwave in the room. The staff at this hotel were truly delightful and seemed to enjoy their job. They were very approachable and helpful. Customer service is obviously a priority.

So you can see it's a hotel focus more on the executive business with pleasure type of client but with potential of so much more by just twikking and redirecting a few things here and their.

The daily housekeeping was erratic in terms of what received attention, and what was replaced - but that's not uncommon in more expensive American hotels. Reception/check out seems to be similarly disorganised - but that is partly the company's fault. I had a reservation for 8 nights, part covered by HHonors points, part pre-paid, and one night covered by a certificate for a free night's stay. I had a single reservation confirmation from the Hilton central reservation service, but the hotel's IT system still treated it as 3 separate reservations, gave me bill at the end of each one, and ignored the fact that I expected to use the certificate.

The hotel computers (5 in total) worked very well. Overall the hotel had an impressive design and decor (lobby and rooms). We would definitely stay again. We would highly recommend you ask for your authorization to visit La Concha Resort (Doubletree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister hotel) which is approx a 20 minute walk. You get to enjoy all the splendid benefits offered at La Concha resort, like: private, beach, towels, chairs, umbrellas, awesome pools and lounge areas. You can even charge your room at the Doubletree for any lunch or other purchases at La Concha. And all this for a third of the price....without settling for much less comfort or style! The Doubletree is located across from a large grocery store, which has anything and everything you could need. In terms of site seeing- we suggest visiting Old San Juan. The streets and shops are very quaint and a pleasure to stroll through. Seeing the Fort Cristobal in Old San Juan is also suggested, as it is an historic landmark. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend visiting the Rain Forest. We found that it was not as grand or impressive as they hyped it up to be...save your $62 per person and spend it somewhere else. If you are into shopping, then you should visit Plaza Las Americas which is the largest mall in the Caribbean, however I did not personally find it any different than shopping in any other mall in the USA, however the mall was very nice and large. In terms of restaurants, I would definitely recommend you visit Mojito\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Old San Juan for some authentic Puerto Rican Mofongos. They are a 3 inch plantain pate filled with your choice of pork, beef, chicken, or crab....I recommend the chicken and pork... prices are reasonable (approx $15-20/person). Another restaurant is Cafe Bebo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Condado; its prices are very reasonable and its food is pretty good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c try the Alcapurrias \u00e2\u20ac\u201cthey are a deep fried breaded beef stuffed appetizer that is delicious, especially dipped in the mayo-ketchup sauce.

We sat in the foyer and having gone back to reception on a number of occassions eventually got into our room at 4.30 - the sun had then gone off the pool area. They had taken our cases and said they would get them up to us immediately and we then waited nearly an hour for the cases to come. The room was nice and had a murphy bed but was on the small side. We had an evening meal at under the trees which was lovely and resonably priced. When we got back to the hotel and pulled the murphy bed down it didn't have any bedding. We again rang down to reception who said they would bring bedding to us and eventually turned up an hour later with sheets !!! We were all tired by this point and as it was warm my sons just slept with sheets.

Plus for us is that they allowed us to store our baggage while we hop to Viequez for a week and retrieve it on our returning stay. I have been trying to find a place to do this since planes to Viequez are typicaly light and small you are limited in what you can bring on. In the case of Cape Air we were allowed a max of 20Kg. So it was a kind of a blessing that we could do this. Secondly the coin operated laundromat was also great as we could wash our clothes for our onward journey.

The no balcony part bothered me more than I thought it would. (they have only a few rooms with a patio, try to get those ones) Apart from that, this hotel is great. The people at the front desk were all super nice, Peter, Raphael... The cleaning lady Karine was great. The serviceman Gerald, was amazing. Really this hotel takes customer service seriously. The location is right across the street from a supermarket open 24 hours, very convenient. There is a bus that takes you directly to old San Juan. The beach is not far. The hotel is affiliated with 2 other hotels were you can spend the day. First the courtyard by Marriott, which after spending the day there, we were really happy that we did not book there. The hotel looks old and the noise from the planes did bother me. The beach there was ok. As for the 2nd hotel, I forgot the name, that was a nice hotel worth going to spend the day there.

I Must say everyone was extremly nice; and it wasnt a fake forcefull nice because there were working (like many hotels). You can easily tell the management of this hotel has done a great job in creating an enjoyable atmosphere for thier employees, in turn the hotel guests get treated extremly good. Just a few reasons why I enjoyed my stay. 1) Me and my girlfirend really didnt plan much before going, but we knew what we wanted to do and it was alot. I called downstairs to inquire about tours and places I Can drive to etc.. Genesis @ front desk asked me a few questions and said to give her a few min. and shell get back to me. After about 15-20 min she called us to come to the front desk she had called different places to check location, prices and availibility on short notice. she spent a good amount of time with us literally making a pen and paper timeline scedule for us for the next four days. We did alot of activites. Thank You Genesis. 2) Driving in PR is a hassle unless you know where you are going. You cant rely on your gps, especially using addresses. etc.. mine worked somewhat better with gps coordinates. But at this hotel they knew I wanted to drive everywhere after assiting like 5 times a day with directions(over the phone aswell|) so one of the managers gave me his card and wrote his personal number on there aswell in case I really get crazy lost. 3) I was partying in the evening and doing all activities during the day so beileve me I really left the room in a mess everyday. And housekeeping really did do a through job everyday cleaning up. 4)Across a 24 hr supermarket u can get everything you need from. 5) Rooms were smaller but really clean and clam and cozy feel. The Only thing was the location: It is not in Old San Juan. it is not in Candado and it is not on a beach. but it is fairly close. so we didnt mind at all. but it was conviently close to the highway which pretty make taes youallover PR. so thats good.

We had a couple of days in San Juan until our return flight back to NYC. When my girlfriend asked why we did not have bathrobes in our room I went to the front desk and requested two for our room. I assumed they forgot to put them in our room because they were in a rush to clean our room because we were asking to have it ready prior to the 3pm check-in time. The first person I spoke to at the front desk attempted to give a reasonable answer for this and told me that they only give them when requested. This seemed strange because the average person would not know bathrobes are provided unless they read the place card in the bathroom. Fortunately, another staff person stepped in and simply had someone provide us with the robes. They were delivered quickly. Other than the incident I just mentioned, overall the staff was excellent. We asked the front desk about finding a vegetarian friendly restaurant in the area and they gave us a variety of restaurants to choose from in the area. We also asked about seafood restaurants in the area. Even though we eat vegetarian we also allow fish in our diet. They again provided a large selection of restaurants, we settled on Marisqueria Atlantica, which was only a few minutes by car from the hotel. It cost about $12 by cab each way. The food there was very good and we were happy with our choice. On another night we did not feel like travelling too far for dinner and went to, Under the Trees, which is located next door to the hotel. The dinner was excellent (pan seared Cajun Red Snapper) which made up for the service, which was very slow. The waitress apologized and said they were hosting a private party in the restaurant and had a new chef, which was fine but that did not explain why it took over 10 mins for a glass of (fresh squeezed) orange juice and sangria (which we were offered complimentary for our extended wait). They also offered us a complimentary dessert, which was a generous gesture. Rafael was especially helpful with the restaurant selection and choosing a tour to take. We wanted to take the cave tour but it was not open on Monday, so we decided to go to the rain forest tour. If you like to hike and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind getting wet, after all it is a rain forest, you will enjoy it. The amenities at the hotel itself were very good. I enjoyed the gym they have.

The front desk staff were pleasant. I have to admit that some were better than others. The one young gentleman that checked us in was not very helpful.

There's a local Puerto Rican restaurant called Bebos around the corner and has very good local food for reasonable price.

The bus stop is just down the street to go to Old San Juan which was very handy. Bebo's Restaurant around the corner was very good and so was the restaurant in the hotel. Ask what the price of the brunch is before you have it. The first day it was $9.95 and the next day it was $19.95 (for the same very small brunch), however we were refunded after complaining.

We settled in and decided to walk about 10 minutes to the beach. Free beach towels, free beach chairs......I couldn;t believe it. The beach near the hotel is not the greatest, small beach and the Atlantic was rough. The beach chairs they give you and really not chairs so to speak, kind of like a mat with a back, but it was nice to have them. Back from the beach and into the pool, it was heaven. The pool is really not as small as noted in earlier reviews, and it has two waterfalls and there are nice lounge chairs. It was a cloudy day with some misty rain, so of course, there were no crowds by the pool. The room is comfortable, modern, with a really nice bathroom. There is free internet with a printer in the computer room, so you can easily check in for your flight. The staff could not have been more welcoming and hospitable, especially Margarita at the front desk and Antonio the bellman. It is a good idea to stay here post cruise for one night, because three cruise ships arrived in San Juan that day, and my friends said that the airport was wild. We went to the airport the next morning, and ours was the only flight there. Had the whole place to ourselves. DO not miss the restaurant on site \"Under The Trees\".

My boyfriend and I were extremely disappointed in the location of the hotel. The hotel is surrounded by buildings. The ONLY good thing is the hotel is located near a supermarket (you can walk there from the hotel). We arrived to the hotel early - 10:30am (after leaving the port, Royal Caribbean, in San Juan). The drive is about 15-20 minutes. The taxi from the port to the hotel was $15 (the most the taxi will charge) plus an additional $1 for each piece of luggage. Our room was ready when we arrived. We absolutely loved the room. Very modern and newly re -renovated. The only negative thing I have to say about the room is there was a strong smell of paint. The pool is very small. There is a pool for adults and a pool for children. For the size of the hotel there were only 15 - 20 lounge chairs. So my boyfriend and I had the choice to either lay on a towel on the floor or to put two chairs together. The hotel did give us the option to use the pool at another hotel, which the only way you could get there was to take a taxi (which cost money). You could walk there, but it would take about 20 to 30 minutes to get there. To me this is not how you spend a vacation. Unfortunately around 2 pm I received a phone call that my grandfather passed away. My boyfriend and I immediately packed out bags and left the hotel to make our flight for 5 (the drive to the airport was about 10-15 minutes). About 10 days later I had called the hotel because 1) MY CREDIT CARD WAS CHARGED TWICE 2) I felt that the hotel should reimburse me back partial of my money since I only stayed 4 hours. I spoke to someone from the front desk and he told me there was nothing they could do for me. Then I had asked to speak to a manager. At first he told me there was nothing he could do for me. After insisting, he eventually told me the only thing he could do was to charge me for using there facilities which is $75 plus taxes which ended up costing me $94, which I think is absolutely ridiculous. I WILL NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN. Also, the hotel (which they don't tell you until you get there) will charge you credit card an additional $50 for room service or restaurant, but if you don't use either one they will put the $50 back on your credit card (so look for that).

Stayed here from 12/31/10 till 01/02/11; a pre-cruise stay.

Upon coming across the listing for this hotel and thru the course of the year i was impressed by the positive reviews listed by TripAdvisor members. Also impressed by management response to any queries/comments brought up by reviewers; this to me was showing 'care' for the needs of the traveler. I met the gentleman, Bo Bramsen, behind the responses during my short stay at the hotel. Pleasant guy, answered any queries i had and wanted to ensure that my stay there was a good one. It was. Upon arrival at hotel, was met by Antonio whom took our bags and provided my party of 8 with a warm chocolate chip cookie for each, very nice. Likable chap, he provided answers to any questions about local area for eating, sightseeing, other interests. A 24 hour grocery store across the street from hotel came in handy too. Hotel accommodations for myself were very fine, i was 1 in a room. The other 2 rooms in our reservation held 3 and 4 people respectively.

I spent many many days researching reviews on Trip Adviser. We were looking for a hotel in San Juan (preferably Hilton chain) but saw many negative reviews about the Caribe, Conrad, and Waldorf. After going with the Doubletree we could not be more pleased. We got off the Royal Caribbean boat and were lucky to find another couple going to the Doubletree. It was a $22 ride but we split it so it only cost us $11. When we arrived the staff was amazing. We were really exhausted from the cruise and the heat and it was really nice to have them bring our suitcases to the desk and then to our room. The warm cookies were also a nice touch. The lobby and room have a really modern and trendy feel. They had a lounge with a huge flat screen TV, restaurant, and bar. The room itself was shockingly clean and also modern. The high speed internet was free and extremely fast. The bathroom had nice glass tile on the shower wall and a trendy vessel sink. Overall we were shocked at how nice it was and the minute we got the room we felt we made a great decision. The location isn't amazing, but it was about a 5 minute walk to a Starbucks, fudruckers, and pizzeria uno. It is moderately close to the airport compared to some of the other hotels. We took a taxi to Old San Juan and I think it ran us $15 each way. I think the taxi to the airport the next day was also about $15. It's probably one of my favorite hotels I've stayed at and that says a lot after struggling to decide on what one to book in San Juan.

Sadly, I kept putting off the review. However, I am writing the review over one year after the fact since it was such an enjoyable experience. I loved that we were able to travel out of the country, and visit Puerto Rico and not deal with the headaches of international travel; we had less than five days for the trip. We did not have to worry about a passport or currency issues. Booked our stay in San Juan through an on-line vendor, and convinced to check out this place after reviewing all sorts of websites (including Trip Advisor). The folks there made the trip extra special. The GM (J.C.) put us into one of a handful suites on the first level (pool level). I ran into an issue with the on-line promotion that I got for breakfast. Surprisingly, J.C. provided us breakfast for free at their hotel bistro \"Under the Trees\" Amazing breakfast! I thought how well can a hotel make breakfast. Ordered the waffles twice - that good. Overall, the hotel was super clean, and the employees were quite gracious. It was hot and humid outside (expected in July), but cool and comfortable inside our room. We were not exactly a hop away (rather, a long hop and a few steps away) from the beach. Rough waters, but soft sand. Plenty of sun. Hopped into the pool area once - literally a few steps away from patio. It was nice having a cup of coffee in our private poolside patio. This hotel provided us a nice jumping off point. We could walk across the street to buy groceries. It was kinda of neat to see the local produce. Walgreens was not too far either. Other local dining options in the area to visit by taxi or even walking. Our last night - wanted a nice, relaxing place to go - Alquimia (Double Tree). Island Shrimp was delicious. Okay, enough on the food. We walked for souvenirs (obvious tourists) and dropped by the El Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico (MAPR) - check out the outdoor garden! El Morro and San Crist\u00c3\u00b3bal are only a bus drive away. We made a day of it in downtown San Juan. Lastly, we had our comfy beds and well decorated room to spend our evenings. I just wish we could have taken some of those warm Double Tree cookies home! Of course, no two people have the same experience. Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend this hotel. We've experienced the resort gig (in Costa Rica), which is very nice, but the Double Tree in San Juan offered us a wonderful home base for our 4 day stay. If we had more time, we would have loved to make some longer trips.

Our initial impression of the grounds was a favorable one. Upon checking in at the counter we were warmly greeted by Courtney and Margarita. We received the traditional and delicious choclate-chip cookies at the conclusion of our registration.The interior lobby was nicely decorated, cheery and polished. Room Accommodations (Appears nice and inviting but....) We resided in Room 602 that had a perfect view of the Super-Max mini grocery store just across the street. Our room was tastefully decorated but unfortunately did not meet our standards of hotel cleanliness. The Safe (Very nice feature) A very nice digital safe was found closed and locked upon entering the room thus requiring a call to the front desk. Mr Ismel came up and corrected the problem within minutes. A special thanks to Courtney for her quick attention to our needs. The Mini-Refrigerator (Quite convenient and adequate) Was a nice amentity and cooled our purchased bottled water and other beverages quite nicely. Maid Service (A lot to be desired) We never did receive the daily two bottles of complimentary water as advertised at any time during our stay. -The view through the main windows that we could see the mini-grocery store included a few disappointing nose smudges. -The mirrored table by the sitting chair was full of fingerprints smudges as well. It appeared that the maid had her fingers on the mirrored table while she was cleaning and never checked to see that the mirror table was really clean after she was done. -The bed sheets although appearing to be fresh did manage to have a fresh stain on the mattress side and on top of the inside sheet as well. This was a total turn-off for the both of us! :-( The furniture needed polishing as well as the glass sliding door to the bathroom was smudgy and required a thorough cleaning also. The floors were inadequately vacummed every day. We even moved the trash can from under the desk- closer to the door to make it easier for the maid however, upon returning back to the room we found the trash can in the exact same location where we had left it?? The Temperature Controls (Worked very well) Worked quite well and 73 degrees appeared to be the ideal setting for us during our stay The Bathroom (Almost great) Included a nice design that was adequately clean and initialy fully stocked with towels and the normal grooming accessories. On our 2nd night we found no bath towels at all and after calling and waiting a couple of hours we were finally properly accommodated. The wash basin was always left wet and not wiped out daily which rendered a tacky appearance. The Shower (Functional obsolesence) Has a nice hand-held shower head-The shower floor was poorly designed because it is not raised up so the water cannot be contained and subsequently runs onto the floor thus causing a potential safety hazard! It's a shame because the bathroom otherwise is well appointed and nice. The Bistro (Excellent but slow service) We ate downstairs a couple of times and found the food to be ok and the portions small. My lady really enjoyed her salads and the coffee was delicious however, on one occasion a big fly managed to find its way into my cup and the waiter humbly apologized and contacted the manager. The manager cordially apologized and did not charge us for both meals. That attention to detail and excellent customer service was most appreciated! We did notice that there was never any salt and pepper on the table for dinner which we found odd. In conclusion, we both agreed that the hotel management needs to have more quality assurance with their maid service. The maid that we had appeared to just go through the motions thus giving you the illusion that the room was in order.

We booked our stay well in advance and were able to get a much reduced price of about $100 per night for the basic queen bed room. Along our trip, we stayed at two other places, all for about the same amount, and simply none could compare with the Doubletree. Also, if you are afraid of traveling during the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hurricane season,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too concerned. We went during the peak of it and had about 10 minutes of rain each day. When it rains, it rains hard, but wait 10 minutes and the sun will be back out. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted with a warm welcome by the staff and the hotel looked amazing. Everything was extremely clean and simply unbeatable for the price. Since we were there on our honeymoon, manager Yodil Caban assured me that they would do everything possible to make it outstanding. Although I had booked the most basic room, we were given one on the first level, with a patio that led out to the pool. As you can see from the pictures, everything was in immaculate condition and a tremendous room. The location of the Doubletree is not ideal, but it is still very convenient to get wherever you need to go. It is located right beside two major bus routes that will take you to the main strip in Condado, as well as right to Old San Juan. Additionally, it is an easy walk down to the strip where there are countless restaurants, as well as beautiful beaches. Right across the street is a Supermax grocery store to pick up snacks, meals, or whatever you would like. Although driving in San Juan can be a challenge, the hotel is also just an hour drive from El Yunque, the rainforest, and an easy day trip. There are numerous places to rent cars; we went to the Enterprise on Ave Ashford, either a quick bus ride down the street or about a half hour walk do the strip. There are closer places if you'd prefer. The one downside to the Doubletree is that the self parking is $15 and valet parking is $20 per night. We spent one week in Puerto Rico, four nights at the Doubletree, another two on the small island of Vieques, and one more at the Doubletree . (I would highly recommend a trip to see the Bioluminescent Bay on the island, it is phenomenal. Also, the beaches of Vieques are incomparable to any I had ever seen before.) So that my wife and I didn't have so much luggage to take on the Vieques Air Link flight over, we left two of our bags at the Doubletree. As soon as we got back to the hotel after our two day trip, I immediately heard my name called out by the bellhop, Antonio. Without waiting for the concierge to say what room he needed to take the bags to, Antonio said he already knew the room and went off to get our luggage. Within minutes, he was at our door with all of our things in perfect condition. All in all, we had an outstanding trip and a tremendous stay at the Doubletree. An added bonus was the delicious warm chocolate chip cookie upon check-in. My only regret is that we only had a week in Puerto Rico.

The hotel tries to be a mini-resort, but just doesn't offer enough to come through on that end. Its location is terrible for a tourist, you definitely need a car (which is a confusing pain) or to catch a cab to go anywhere. Would I stay here again, probably not. For a comparable price I'd pick the Sheraton in Old San Juan. If you need to be in the Condado area of San Juan on business this is definitely a great pick.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cExcellent experience\u201d", "Author": "PRTravelerUSA", "ReviewID": "UR76827900", "Content": "A very nice hotel.

I have traveled extensively and have NEVER encountered a group of employees who were as courteous, helpful and knowledgable as this group. No matter what question or concern we had, they were there to help. What an amazing staff!!!!!! The reason I cannot give this hotel a higher rating concerns the cleaning staff. Our room was just not cleaned properly during our stay. Beds were never changed (as evidenced by a stain on a sheet that remained there). The bathrooms were barely cleaned during our week there. Water marks on the glass door remained. The shower had sand residue from a day at the beach that was never cleaned out. The counter was never wiped down. Soap, shampoo and toilet paper were not replaced as they were used. The hairdryer was never put back. We had 5 towels upon arrival. After the first day, they replaced them with 2 or 3 leaving the hairdryer on the shelf that originally held additional towels. A sheet was not replaced on an air mattress so there were no covers one night. Overall-the cleaning staff was poorer than the majority of hotels I have stayed in.

We are a family on a budget and this is the perfect place to stay if you don't want to rent a car.

The first four nights of our trip was in San Juan, Puerto Rico. As hotels in Puerto Rico are pretty expensive and heavily taxed, we decided to stay at the Doubletree San Juan, which had good rates for the days we were staying. The fact that Doubletree is a Hilton property and that particular Doubletree had gotten great reviews on Trip Advisor helped seal the deal. We collect Hilton Honors points and I've not yet been disappointed by Trip Advisor's advisories. Location The first thing to know about the Doubletree in San Juan is that it is not located in Old San Juan. It's in Condado, which is a newer part of town. Condado struck me as more of the business area in San Juan. It's also fairly close to the beach. To get to Old San Juan, you'll need to take the bus or a cab, unless you have a car at your disposal. If you plan to take the bus, be sure to have exact change (75 cents). The fact that Doubletree is in Condado is not a bad thing if you want to go to the beach. There's a super handy 24 hour supermarket across the street from the Doubletree. We also enjoyed the awesome art museum which is within walking distance of the hotel. Checking in We arrived at the Doubletree at about 10:00pm. We were warmly greeted by Rafael, the bellhop. If you stay at the Doubletree in San Juan, be sure to get to know Rafael. He's always smiling and tremendously helpful! Tip him generously, because he deserves it! Throughout our stay, Rafael did everything he could to see that we felt welcome. Our room Our standard room was pretty small by American standards. We had a queen sized bed, a desk with wireless Internet, a large flat screen TV with local cable, a microwave, and a fridge. Ice was available down the hall and we had a Wolfgang Puck coffee maker. There wasn't a very nice view from our window. Besides blackout shades, the windows were covered with a lighter shade that let in sunlight but kept out the depressing view. The bathroom The bathroom was very small, but stylishly appointed with a rainfall shower, a Villeroy and Boch toilet and sink, and Neutrogena toiletries. Other hotel amenities The San Juan Doubletree has a gift shop, complete with Godiva chocolates, a business center with free access to the Internet, a fitness center with Precor equipment, and a very nice pool area with manmade waterfalls, a hot tub, and lots of lounge chairs. Food Aside from the fantastic Doubletree cookies one gets upon checking in (and from Rafael if he catches you looking crestfallen), the San Juan Doubletree has several restaurants. We tried one of them, Michael's Bistro, for breakfast our first day. Breakfast was not included in our rate and, to be honest, I thought it was a bit overpriced. I think we paid about $12 each for lukewarm eggs and bacon. The coffee left much to be desired. I would recommend going elsewhere for breakfast unless it's included in your stay. There are plenty of options nearby, including the 24 hour supermarket across the street. Breakfast is served there. The Condado area also has some pretty good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. If you're keen to eat onsite, there's Silk, which specializes in Asian food, Under The Trees, a pasta and omelet themed restaurant, and Alquimia, a wine and tapas bar. We didn't try any of these restaurants, which I think were located in the business area directly adjacent to the Doubletree. I can also recommend Bebo's Cafe, a great no-frills restaurant just around the corner from the Doubletree. We ate lunch there and not only was the food good and plentiful, it was also cheap! The concierge We were very impressed by the concierge, who was helpful when we decided to take a day trip to El Yunque. She helped us rent a car and gave us directions to the rainforest. Our overall experience We liked the Doubletree, though the bed was a bit harder than I would have liked it. While not being in Old San Juan kind of kept us out of the tourist action, we liked the Condado area because it was close to the beach and wasn't overrun with tourists waiting for cruise ships. The fact that it was somewhat less expensive than the resorts in San Juan made it even more attractive to us. And that supermarket across the street was very convenient! I think we'd stay there again if we ever go back to Puerto Rico. It's clear that the San Juan Doubletree's manager is very concerned with customer service. He's got a great staff working for him.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cGood for business travel but why no room service beyond breakfast???\u201d", "Author": "jmfangio", "ReviewID": "UR62829800", "Content": "As others have already stated, this is a nice hotel and the service overall is quite good.

The wifi worked well everywhere in the hotel and was free, the rooms were nicely appointed and in good condition, there were decent public spaces to go work. Everyone I came into contact with was courteous and helpful. A glaring omission for business travelers is the lack of room service beyond breakfast. I find this baffling as when you travel for work, you rarely have time to go out and find restaurants and often eat in the room. When I called the room service number, I was told that I could go down to the restaurant order and pick it up, but there was no menu in room and no actual room service. I do not find this acceptable in any way. In addition, I found out that they don't actually serve lunch at all, only breakfast and dinner! This is another issue for business travelers. I would trade the Godiva chocolate store that's in the lobby for real room service and a restaurant that serves all 3 meals.

I do agree with previous reviews regarding its staff - The staff is extremely courteous and friendly - I say the most friendly in all our travels. They all go out of their way to satisfy your needs. The front desk serves as concierge helping you with booking excursions, transportation, advice on sightseeing, admissions, bus routes, restaurants, etc. They are all extremely knowledgeable - trust their advice! The bellhop, Rafael, is very friendly and carries a permanent smile on his face! Location & Transportation: Very safe. Tourist police are noticeable at all times. 20-30 minute bus ride to Old San Juan - depending on traffic. Bus fare is $0.75USD pp. Easily accessible. Take Bus B-21 - stop is located right across the street. Tell the bus driver your destination and they tend to remember and advise you when your stop is coming up! Great service! Taxi from SJU airport to hotel is $14USD + $1USD per bag + Tip. This is standard fee. From and to pier is @$15USD. Restaurants: Although the hotel has an independent restaurant on premises Michael's Bistro, we were very disappointed that the hotel offers no room service from this only eatery on the property. This is not usual Hilton standard. You can order and pick-up which is very inconvenient. The front desk advised us that they are working on that. The bistro, modernly decorated,has excellent service and food. We both tried the Cuban Sandwich served with fries or onion rings that although it was not exactly the \"true\" Cuban Sandwich (I am Cuban) - it was excellent! The server prepared a special complimentary drink he created called \"Sangria\" which I highly recommend. The restaurant is on the first floor by the entrance which unfortunately allows for an uncomfortable environment when the front hotel lobby doors open, high humidity retains in the enclosed area. Better off eating outside. In the building adjacent to the hotel you will find other fine restaruants such as Silk and Under the Trees. Both offer very good food in a very nice environment. Around the corner is a local restaurant Bebo's, also very good with its local traditions. Housekeeping: This is a problem that really upset us. When we first arrived, no towels were in the room. Unfortunately I noticed this upon coming out of the shower and had to use the hand towels to dry. We later called and towels were taken up quickly. There seems to be no area for bath towels in the bathroom so they were left on the counter by the room window daily afterwards. Pretty odd. Room was never cleaned properly. Upon our initial arrival we found food items purchased by the previous guests in the small fridge and nonperishable items in the small pantry furniture. Upon arriving we also found a dead roach in back of the decor chair and it was never vacuumed-up during our 5 day stay although I kept moving that chair so housekeeping would notice. The sink bowl contained the same toothpaste residue on the outside for our entire stay. I wiped it up the last morning myself. Mirrors were never wiped up. I usually travel with a Clorox-CleanUp pack for these reasons. Lately, even Hilton properties are slacking in housekeeping. The \"Sweet Dreams\" white decor pillow had a red stain on the front. This was never repalaced nor cleaned. Amenities such as shampoos, face cleanser, etc, were never replaced once used. We did not report these issues as they were embarrased enough with the towel and other incident with the shower later described. Room: The room is modern decored with a European style bath. Shower is large and spacious with a safety bar but no handheld showerhead. Coffee, tea, fridge, microwave, iron & ironing board, in-room safe, free wi-fi throughtout entire hotel and free wired connection in room. Two phones, alarm/radio clock, 32\" LCD TV, comfortable desk and lots of lighting. Make-up mirror in bathroom and hair dryer. Not too much area for personal items in the bathroom. Shower leaked profusely. Reported that and maintenance came immediatly to try and correct. It continued to leak so just used towels to hold it in. Dangerous situation as you can slip and fall after shower. Bed in this room is queen size and not comfortable . We found it to be on the \"hard\" side causing back pain. You could feel the springs. Bed also \"creaked\" constantly upon sitting on edge. One big problem we encountered was the window shades - no curtains in room. The shades are not \"darkening shades\" so light enters the room at 6am brightening the entire area. If you need to sleep in a dark room, this is not the hotel for you. Room size excellent for two people. Hotel Areas: Hotel is designed very european style. Beautiful lobby areas. Front desk is hidden in the rear by elevators. Dont understand that concept. Pool area needs updating and more inticing decor. Business area has three desktops for guest use- nice and clean area. There is also a counter in the lobby with 2 secured laptops that are for guest use. Beautiful floral arrangement greets you in the lobby. There is a small gift shop by the front desk that specializes in chocolates- Godiva chocolates, too. Visited the excersice area but did not use. Seemed clean. Taxis are available at all times. We didn't have car but valet parking is $20per day. Ouch! I have nothing but good compliments to the entire staff of this establishment but overall, this hotel is good for a first time non-beach stay in Puerto Rico however, we will probably stay elsewhere in the future.

They also advertise massages, but during the entire trip, there was never anybody working in the Gym/Massage area. It was just an empty desk the whole time.

And the hotel we switched to was only $50 more than the Doubletree. My recommendation is, if you're going on a vacation to San Juan, don't skimp, spend the few extra bucks and go to a place with a nicer staff, nicer amenities and enjoy the resort experience.

Decor is very modern, the room and bathroom were spotless, aircon was quiet, lovely powerful shower, and in general it was a pleasure to stay there. The only problem I had was that I had booked a 'romance package' so was expecting a bottle of wine, however this hadn't arrived by the time we were leaving to dinner so I mentioned it to reception and told them that it wasn't worthwhile any more and that a fruit basket or something similar would be ok instead. However when we came back, they had supplied both the sparking wine & fruit, so this was fine for me. Our arrival before the checkin time was most likely why this problem occurred so I don't think it should reflect poorly on the hotel or team. The only other problem was an unrequested automated wakeup call at 6:30AM. Internet access was free and functional though was quite slow. Breakfast using the included vouchers from our package (different menu to normal) was very nice, service was good and the food was plentiful and well prepared. All in all, we were very impressed with this hotel. I choose it because of the reviews on Tripadvisor and was happy I did. In fact it was even better than I expected.

I originally had planned on booking a two night stay at the Conrad San Juan Condado prior to a Southern Caribbean cruise on Carnival Victory back in December, but after reading the reviews on here about the Doubletree San Juan, I decided to stay there. I am also a Hilton Honors member and preferred to stay at Hilton hotels, so it fit perfectly. I corresponded with Yodil Caban, the hotel manager prior to my arrival and he made sure my stay was a nice one before I even arrived! Friday December 11th, I arrived to the hotel by taxi and was welcomed by bellhop Ezekiel (some name like that) who helped take my luggage to the front desk. At the front desk I was warmly welcomed by Juan who quickly pulled up my booking information and gave me my room key. To my surprise, he told me that Yodil was expecting my arrival and upgraded my room to the 6th floor with a view towards the ocean! The room was nicely furnished with nice decor, bed, and flat screen TV. I had originally booked a room with Murphy bed, but this room did not have one. I had a friend who arrived the next day and Juan made sure to get an air mattress put in the room upon his arrival. The Saturday evening I went to pick up my friend, utilizing the convenience of the bus stop outside to go to the airport (more about that in the another section). When we came back to the hotel and went to our room and the extra bed was ready along with two complimentary bottled water and cookies! Even though I did not get to meet Yodil, I did meet operations manager Jose Cepero who asked us how was our stay so far and if anything else he can make it better. I told him everything was perfect. He then advised us that people will be washing the windows in the early morning on Sunday and that it maybe noisy. However, we slept in and the window cleaning on the outside didn't bother us. Convenience wise this hotel is next to a 24hr Super Max supermarket, which came in handy as we bought stuff for our cruise. There is business center and two laptops in the lobby for guests to use. The beach is a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Also, along the street is a bus stop which I utilized a lot during my stay at the Doubletree hotel. I hate riding taxis and like riding mass transit in cities I visit because its a way for me to explore as well as interact with the locals. I took the B-21 bus to the Tren Urbano Sargrado Corazon station and then transferred to the B-22 bus to goto Plaza Las Americas (the largest mall in the Caribbean). I went to the airport to pick up my friend, rode the bus in front of the hotel to the Tren Urbano and rode that to the Pinero station and then took the bus to the airport. You can also take A-5 bus to old San Juan, which is what my friend and I did on Sunday prior to our cruise. Sunday we checked out and the hotel held our luggage while we when sightseeing at places like El Morro, Old San Juan, and the Bacardi tour. Also, the staff told us about Bebos Cafe which was just a short walk from the hotel, a nice local place to eat! Went there twice to eat during the stay! I just wished my stay at the Doubletree San Juan was longer.

The 24-hour supermarket across the street is a fully-fledged grocery store... they have just about everything. Recommended restaurants nearby: Bebo's Cafe, La Patisserie (for their weekday breakfast specials). As previous reviewers have stated, head to Luquillo for a nice beach that's not far out of San Juan.

BE AWARE of all service charges/taxes that will be added to your bill. Hilton discloses these (~25%) when you book, but some of the other sites may not, and you should take this into consideration.

(Be prepared: EACH person MUST have HIS/HER OWN EXACT bus fare - we didn't know this and my husband and I added our fares together. We held the bus up and were thankful that a small child had some extra change for us!) Bus ride is approx. 20 mins. to Old San Juan. It's a great way to see the everyday streets and meet the locals! - variety of restaurants on-site. We found them very-reasonably priced and very good! - a short 5 min. walk to Bebo's Cafe - where the locals eat! Try some authentic Puerto Rican dishes for great prices! (approx. $5-8/dish). AWESOME food!!! Be ready to speak your best spanish as many of the waitresses/waiters don't speak english :) Totally worth it!!! - 10-15 min. walk to Ocean Park beach. Beautiful, wide open beach, light sands... it was just so relaxing wading and floating around to the rhythym of the ocean waves. Bring bottled water with us and if you forget, don't fret - local men wearing bags that keep drinks (local beer!!) icy cold sell their beer for $3 each. Nothing beat the sun sizzling our skin and the icy, cold beer running through our bodies! Also, other local people walk along the vast Ocean Park beach selling hot, fried local foods for cheap and also their yummy, refreshing ice cream!! - we were lucky enough to have a room on the bottom floor, with a sliding door that led out to our own patio which then led to the hot tub/ swimming pool area! It was an absolute treat!!! It was so clean, beautiful, relaxing and how can we complain about our access to the pool!!! Our last night there, while my husband and I enjoyed our wine, compliments of the hotel as our anniversary gift, we spent our time hot tubbing and meeting people from all over the world! It was our own little party just 30 steps away from our hotel room's patio! It was great! The NOT-SO-GOODS: - taxi ride was approx. $15-$18 to OSJ (Old San Juan) so my husband and I had to plan our trips to OSJ carefully. For example, we thought twice about having dinner in OSJ because going there and back in the evening would cost us $30 for a taxi ride. BUT if we spent our day in OSJ and took the bux there, then we'd only spend $15 for the night taxi ride back to the hotel as we preferred not to take the bus at night. - you may have to wait close to 30 min. for a bus ride from OSJ back to the hotel in the middle of the day (like we had to). We weren't in a rush but waiting that long was a little annoying. Maybe try to find a bus schedule?? I consider myself organized, but I wasn't THAT prepared... - no nightlife at the hotel - this could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you're looking for. If you want to dance, gamble at a casino, etc, you'll have to taxi or bus to other nearby hotels. Overall, the staff and the service made up for the distance to other places around the city.

A 24 hr grocery store across the street. Art museum a 5 min walk. The bristro in the hotel was expensive for the quality. Under the Trees across the lot was a great atmosphere and a good value for the quality. Very close the airport and the cruise ports. Tours booked through the hotel were fantastic. We told them what we wanted they did everything, we just showed up in the lobby at the time they told us. I would stay here again as a family vacation or just as a get away for two. Oh and the warm chocolate chip cookies are great at check in.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ft.

When the hotel become Hilton (End of year 2008) I stayed until today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s date four times and I can confirm the reservations process doesn't work good or better said it is not the same as it was in the past. For my last stay I called five times the past week from the states to the Hotel in Puerto Rico to make the reservations and after greeting the person who answered the phone he transfer the call to reservations. Them put me on hold, and after long waiting (more than five minutes), I hung-up and called back again and again. I thought that they were very busy that day and called back the day after and the waiting was the same, so I called back and inform the person who answered the phone what was going on and she transferred my call to the Hilton reservations center in the US, where I finally booked my reservations. Because I felt loyal to the hotel I called back to Puerto Rico asking for the general Manager Mr. Yodil to inform him what was happening, and after confirming that he was at the office I requested one of his assistants to transfer my call to him. He didn't take the call, I called back him twice presuming to speak with him and left a voice message asking for a call back, and he never did. When I checked in on, September 14th, 2009 I asked for him to inform about this but again he IGNORED me. This is the reason why I am writing this review. In general I am satisfied with the hotel, specially I like the location and the front desk customer service is outstanding; but as a person, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel good when the Manager ignores me not one but more than four times. I will do my research to find a hotel close to this area to switch for next stays and I really recommend the travelers to test the reservation process calling to [--]", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, PR", "Title": "\u201cIt was an excellent choice!\u201d", "Author": "niom-k", "ReviewID": "UR42224469", "Content": "Went with my husband for the first 2 nights of our honeymoon.

We were a little but scared of staying in a room with a Murphy bed but the bed was very big and comfortable!! as was the other bed in the room.Staff was very friendly and said hi whenever you passed them in the hallways, the lobby, or down by the pool. Very nice workout facility and gorgeous pool and jacuzzi! I would recommend this hotel for anyone staying in puerto rico. Pretty close to the beach to! Only about 3 blocks. However I would probably not recommend this hotel for kids bc theres not a lot to keep them entertained in condado. Make sure to visit the market across the street and fill your in room fridge up to save yourself some money. This is more of a business traveler hotel but was great for our vacation stay. Internet is free and fast! Theres also a computer room with several computers. Overall a great experience!! whether for business or for pleasure.
