The staff greeted me every single time I walked in the door, had suggestions on sightseeing, gave me directions, and were incredibly helpful. It was great. The hotel is a little older than some hotels in the area and is made up of several buildings around a parking lot. There's a garage below the main building that's a little tricky to drive into due the angles up, down and then the way parking is laid out. It did work but took some getting used to. There's a daily fee for parking but sometimes it's included in the rate package. All of the spaces I used - public areas, garage, my room were maintained and clean. Everything was in working order. I used the laundry facilities which had 3 coin operated washers and dryers. The fitness center had 3 treadmills, 2 elipticals, free weights and a cycling machine and was located right off the lobby. The pool is outside. I tried to extend my stay but the hotel was booked.

Booked on marriot.com and am glad that I got the room + parking package, which made my parking cost $1. This is an older building, somewhat confusing at first but after that it makes sense. The driveway entrance is very steep and very short - had to back up into the street when the truck in front of me needed to exit. Once I actually got into the lobby the desk clerk was friendly and checking in was quick. Parking underground would be a bit challenging if you have a large vehicle - the height restriction is 6'5\" I think. My rental Impala fit in just fine and I felt secure behind that big gate. My room was in building 3 (the same as the lobby) and the elevator in the basement parking went straight up to my floor. Very convenient! The room itself was fairly standard, seemed clean and everything worked. I didn't like that the desk faced away from the TV - usually I like to work on my laptop with the TV on in front of me. (Granted, I mostly listen to TV but still...) Breakfast was adequate - scrambled eggs every day, Activia and Light n Fit yogurt, oatmeal, waffle machines (2). They should clean (or replace) the toasting machine. During the 3 days I stayed there, something burned every day and once there was actual fire. I recommend visiting the Fresh Market which is very close by - perhaps 3 minute drive. Similar to a Whole Foods or Trader Joe's - great fresh produce, good selection of food to bring back to the hotel.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Danville", "Title": "\u201cNice place to stay in Miami\u201d", "Author": "golfergeo", "ReviewID": "UR124983485", "Content": "We wanted to come down to Miami Beach and see the Art Deco area of South Beach. However when I got to looking at the accomodations, I wasn't real happy with the reviews I was reading. We are in our 60s and aren't party all night-type of people. I didn't like the idea of a smallish room even though it was in a historic Art Deco hotel. In talking with an old friend, she recommended Coconut Grove area and this Residence Inn appeared to be a pretty good place to stay for a couple of nights. We drove into South Beach, spent the entire day taking tours and looking around, then came to Coconut Grove to rest up and enjoy the warm weather. We stayed in a 5th floor room with 2 queen beds. Large room, full kitchen (which we really didn't use, other than the ice maker), nice TV, old plumbing fixtures , nice & clean. I'm guessing this an old building based on the round ball control plumbing fixtures. At least they have instructions on the shower wall to help you figure out how to get hot water. Secure parking in basement garage that was $15/day. It was very convenient to get luggage in & out of car to & from room. Internet speed isn't sufficient to handle lots of data but it doesn't work (albeit with slow response) to bring up email and do tourist related research. Breakfast was very nice, raisin bran & fresh fruit, hot scrambled eggs, sausage one day and bacon the next, lots of table space (especially for the number of people eating at 8:45). Within walking distance to CoCoWalk, which has several eating choices that were very nice. We never were around the hotel to sample their evening food offerings but the desk staff made us aware that there was food available.

My wife and young son could walk everywhere with no problem while I was away at work. no beaches but nice parks, a kids gym, shops and a starbucks. The hotel is a bit odd. Not your standard Residence Inn, but all the fundamentals are there. The \"interior\" of the hotel is really an outside compound where you find the rooms, the parking, the pool etc... All of this seems all right for Florida. The secure parking is a bonus and provides nice peace of mind. The room, in our case a one bedroom suite, was very clean with all the amenities of a Residence Inn. The house keeping was erratic. Some days it was cleaned with extra care, other days just a quick once through. Never dirty though. For some reason, towels are not in abundance. The customer service was also erratic. Some front desk clerks not greeting guests who come and go, breakfast staff not clearing tables in time.It seems, at times, only the managers were interested in the welfare of the customers, while the employees were not so much, particularly the front desk. Not trying to make a blanket statement, but definitely these employees need to be aware of some of the finer points of customer service The biggest annoyances, however, was that the cable in the bedroom would mysteriously cut out.

We had originally booked at the Courtyard Marriott in Coral Gables, but when we got there (after midnight), the last room left didn't have a working air conditioner. So they got us a replacement room at this Residence Inn a few blocks away. The parking deck at the Residence Inn charges a daily rate ($15, I think) which is annoying since other nearby hotels don't (like the Courtyard). The room was clean. The king size bed was comfortable. Like a lot of Florida hotels, there was a humid feeling the whole time like the air conditioner couldn't quite keep up. The kitchenette in the room seemed older but recently repainted. The bathroom was small. The sheets and bed linens were comfortable, but our towels seemed thin and scratchy. Access to the rooms is from the exterior -- not an interior hall -- which seemed a little low-end considering the rate for the room. The breakfast buffet (free) looked really good, but the manager was really, really rude to me about the waffle iron. My waffle stuck, and he asked rudely if I'd used a special spray first. I hadn't, but I had followed the directions on a large printed poster. And at a Drury and Hampton recently, the waffle irons didn't require me to spray them first. He was really irritated and started scraping my waffle off, even though I was going to do that myself and eat it in parts. I just grabbed a yogurt and left, really irritated, after that.

We are big fans of the Residence Inn chain. We have done two international moves with four cats and now a baby as well and we like them because they tend to be spacious, clean, accept pets, and have awesome breakfasts. I agree with previous reviewers that this is not like other RI's. The bedrooms and bathrooms are much smaller than the other 3 RI's we have stayed in, but our biggest complaint was the noise. The hotel is spread out motel-style and our room was on the ground floor, just a few feet from one of the pools (there are two small pools) and we could hear everything. Every splash, laugh, shriek... The pool is supposed to close at 10 pm, but several nights people were partying by the pool, drinking bottles of beer (which isn't allowed) and talking/laughing very loudly. I had to call the front desk several times to complain. After a few nights of this, I spoke to one of the managers at breakfast and she was very polite, apologetic, and professional, and even sent a bag of goodies to our room, which was kind of her, and that night the front desk staff did go to kick out people after 10 pm. However, the soundproofing was bad everywhere. The walls were so thin I could hear the people in the room next to us talking, their tv, dog barking, etc. I feel bad for them as we had an 6 month old baby with us, who, despite our best efforts, did occasionally cry... Furthermore, since the hotel is motel-style and we were on the ground floor, we had to keep our curtains drawn at all times, as people would be passing by and also would be in the pool, making us feel like we were living in a cave. Breakfast was always extremely crowded and several times they ran out of food and there was nowhere to sit. Our last night was awful - someone pulled the fire alarm at 1 am and then it kept going off hourly as no one at the front desk called the fire department to reset it!! (my husband went to complain around 4 am and the person said, \"We think it's a prank and the alarm just keeps going off because no one's called the FD to reset it\" to which he responded that it might be a good idea for them to do that!!). Lastly, RI have free dinners some nights and one of the nights we planned on attending was listed on the sheet on the fridge as starting at 7:30 pm, but it was apparently a typo and started at 5:30 pm. Considering the activities sheet is for the month and this was at the end of the month, they should have either reprinted the sheet or had housekeeping change it. It was frustrating when we were planning on getting dinner that way (always difficult with a young baby). The good parts: Coconut Grove is a fun area and the hotel is walking distance to many stores and restaurants; the breakfast is varied; the fitness room was much nicer than most hotels'; plentiful parking; free Wi-Fi; accept pets (extra charge).

I was on a family vacation with my wife and two teenage daughters and booked a 2-bedroom suite. It was a typical RI with outside entrances into a Spartan, but appropriately furnished Living room with small dining area and a galley kitchen off to the side. The two bedrooms were almost equal in size. Beds and furniture were comfortable and had that RI touch of being utilitarian, but appealingly modern. Overall, space is a bit tight, but functional. Surprisingly, there was only one en suite bath, and that was very small with only one sink. There were three TVs, one in each bedroom and one in the living room with a large selection of channels including HBO. The free internet was fine, although they should consider going wireless since the ethernet provides for only one user at a time, and as I mentioned, I had two teenage daughters. There were two small, kidney-shaped pools in this fairly sprawling complex. The hotel has gated entrances to the parking area, although this security was defeated by a side entrance gate that was always open. This hotel has easy access to the main North-South Florida highways and is a few short blocks from main Coconut Grove areas including the touristy CocoWalk. RI served a free hot & cold breakfast although the steam-table scrambled eggs and sausage patties were usually overdone. The staff of the Coconut Grove Residence Inn, from the manager to the cleaning staff was exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to help you out. The Coconut Grove RI isn't the lap of luxury, but strikes a balance between comfort and price. We got it at $256, AAA rate. Restaurant Recommendations: Do you self a favor and skip the generic, mall ubiquitous Hooters and Cheesecake Factory in CocoWalk. In the next two blocks are a couple of great restaurants. For great Latin American style seafood and ceviche, Jaguar. When that Residence Inn breakfast gets tired, which it will after two days, go to the Green Street Caf\u00c3\u00a9.

I chose this hotel because it had a two bedroom/two bath suite which included a full kitchen and living and dining area. I had read all the reviews on Tripadvisor and tried to adjust my expectations accordingly. Our previous stays in Coconut Grove had always been at the Mayfair Hotel and Spa. We paid a AAA rate of $289 per night for the suite, which was far less expensive than two rooms at the Mayfair and gave us gathering room and space for the baby to play. The hotel is located about three blocks from the Mayfair Shops and CocoWalk. We could see the Sofitel Hotel just off the entrance to the hotel and the Ritz Carlton was just a couple of blocks away. We very much liked the location, in a quieter semi-residential area. The Mayfair Hotel has the disadvantage of being in party central and with quite a bit of outside noise very late at night. Our first impression of the hotel was somewhat unfavorable. It looks like a very old condo re-do, and though I expected the outdoor entrances to the suites, it looked a little \"iffy\" to me. Check-in was very nice and friendly, very efficient. We had requested a crib for the baby and it was delivered promptly. For those of you with infants, it was not an actual crib, but a \"pack and play\" crib/playpen combo. What was very nice is that they provide a pack of bedding for the crib that included fitted sheets for the mattress and extra blankets of crib size. We did have to set up the crib ourselves, which took only a few minutes. The suite itself was relatively disappointing to me. Upon entering, you are in the dining/kitchen/living area. A small dining table pushed up against the window that could seat four if you moved it away from the window. The living area was tiny - a recliner chair and a sofa that could seat three, coffee table, one side table with a lamp and a small stand with a TV. Lighting was inadequate and would have made working here very difficult. The kitchen had a full size fridge, microwave, dishwasher, stove, sink (no disposal) with cabinetry. There were simple kitchen untensils, a toaster, dishes, etc. for four along with basic pots and pans. Everything was extremely clean. Paper towels, dishcloths, dishwasher and dish soap provided. The two bedrooms and baths were just off the living area. Our bedroom was very tight - queen bed, two night stands, one small dresser with three drawers, TV, iron and ironing board in the closet. The second bedroom was a bit larger, more storage space, same furnishings. Both the bedrooms had the Marriott Revive beddng - good matresses, fine quality bedding. The two bathrooms were not en suite, but had to be accessed from the common hallway. One bathroom was completely contained behind closed doors, the other had the sink open to the hall with the toilet and shower behind a closed door. This was OK for us as a family, but if you had to share with another couple, privacy might be an issue. There were plentiful, good quality towels and shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion provided. Hairdryers for both baths, extra TP and Kleenex under both sinks. Housekeeping was attentive and efficient. They always honored the Do Not Disturb sign on the door and seemed to clean the room the moment we left. We did have a couple of room issues - one clogged sink and an outlet that didn't work. When we reported this to the front desk the repairs were made while we were out for a couple of hours and a message was left on the phone to confirm our satisfaction with the repairs. The hotel rate included breakfast each morning (6:30 to 9:30 am weekdays, 7:00 to 10:00 am weekends) and an evening social from 5:00 to 7:00 pm Mon-Thurs. We weren't able to take advantage of these offerings, but thought that was a great added value to the room rate. There are two small pools located on the property, but weather didn't permit our using this feature. Three of our group used the small gym and thought it was well maintained with an adequate array of equipment in excellent condition. There is a guest laundry on the premise. This hotel didn't quite meet my expectations, but I rated it neutral/average for several reasons. The employees are great and the service provided is excellent. The property is very clean and well maintained. The biggest selling point is the value. We never intended to spend much time in the room (which was pretty disappointing to me, though not to my husband and daughter and son-in-law) and the rate proved to be an excellent value. Great location, great employees, excellent value in a very expensive part of Miami. I would stay here again, I would recommend it to budget conscious family and friends. So much to see and do close by - University of Miami, Key Biscayne, South Beach, museums, shopping etc. Do a better job of adjusting your expectations than I did and you will be surprised by the great employees and excellent value of this Residence Inn.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coral Gables, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice, comfortable stay\u201d", "Author": "shan_luv2travel", "ReviewID": "UR12607885", "Content": "From the exterior, this hotel doesn't look terribly impressive. However, the service, location, and room itself were great. First, the staff - very friendly, very helpful. Checking in and out was easy and we had no problems. We were even able to leave our rental car in the hotel garage on Sunday until it was time to head back to the airport, which was very convenient. The location is great - just a short walk to CocoWalk (Cheesecake Factory, Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Tu Tu Tango) and other shopping and restaurants. My husband and I had lunch at Jaguar, which was fun (good Sangria and ceviche). We also took a walk over to the marina to look at the boats, which was enjoyable. I'm not sure about some of the other reviewers saying this must be in a bad area, this hotel is directly across the street from the Ritz-Carlton and other upscale establishments -- I certainly didn't feel unsafe. We were also able to easily catch a cab to South Beach (around $30). The room, while not ultra luxurious (not sleek, new appliances, but a nicely appointed kitchen nonetheless), was perfectly fine in my opinion. Everything was very clean and the bed was really comfy.

The location is great, the rooms are clean, the food is a bonus, and there was ample parking, so it received a 4 star. The only minus was the thin walls, and the fact that I could hear road noise. Coconut Grove is about 15-20 minutes (max) away from South Beach w/o all the craziness. It's also a central location to go to the zoo and REALLY close to the Seaquarium, Vizcaya Museum, and the Science Museum. The rooms seem smaller than the other Residence Inns as if this property belonged to another chain before. It has outside corridors like a motel, except that once you get inside, there's a kitchen and a door in front of the bedroom (we got the 1 bedroom). Room looked recently remodeled (no stained carpet, for example). Bathroom is a little small; I barely had room to dry myself after a shower without banging into the wall or the sink. The bedroom had a full size mirrored closet, and they sent extra hangers when I asked. They have two guest laundries with several washers and dryers (bring your own supplies!), and I hardly saw anyone use them, although we did. Breakfast is free every morning, not just donuts, but a hot breakfast including biscuits and gravy, eggs, and sausage. On M-Th, there is \"Happy Hour\" of either pasta; soup and salad; or hamburgers. This saved us quite a bit of money (I paid $180/night). On our last night, the food ran out, so there was a lag time in which there wasn't any food for at least 15 minutes. All the employees I observed worked hard and tried hard to please the guests. They are short handed though, so there are sometimes a line with guests waiting a while for help while a clerk is helping solve a complex issue. Sometimes, the phones are ringing one call after another while guests are being helped at the front desk. However, the clerks are always are (or try to be) pleasant. The only thing that bothered me were that the dividing walls were too thin, so I could hear casual conversations (not yelling, although there was that), phone ringing, closing of drawers and closet doors, and other noises. Although it's not on a busy street, every night (even after 1:00-2:00 a.m.) I heard several sirens of emergency vehicles (it's not in a bad area) and cars roaring their engines (not a race drag either). This outside noise didn't bother me as much as the next door noises because I didn't know how long it was going on for or whether they would be considerate of us (we were very quiet after 11:00 p.m.). I requested a quiet room when I booked my reservation, so I was disappointed in the noise... in our case, we slept late every night, so we fell asleep pretty quickly; otherwise, this would be a problem, since one night our next door neighbous were up till at least 1:30 a.m. talking. Another morning, the cell phone rang early morning (7:00'ish), and I could hear his conversation, but I managed to fall asleep again. On my last night, I asked about a quieter area, and a clerk indicated some other buildings that would have been better, so I was bummed I didn't get a better room. However, the bottom line is that I would stay here again because of the location and the value for my money. I couldn't find a better hotel that would have been less expensive.", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fairfield,CT", "Title": "\u201cVery dissapointed this stay Ants,Worms, Centipede, Huge Roach\u201d", "Author": "babe8720", "ReviewID": "UR10584243", "Content": "I regret having to write this review,but feel it is my duty to inform the public about this stay at this Inn.

The first morning I woke, there were little red ants comingup the drains, so I stopped them up.The next day, a huge centipede, in the bathroom. The next day redish color worms, in my room, bedroom wall, one day worm in sink. On the 3rd. night a roach in the bedroom closet ,bigger than a half dollar.Called for the man on duty to kill this one. On my last night there I took towels and put them under the door where you enter the room, because I saw 2 worms going in the room next to me. Still I woke to a worm on the towel inside my room.The whole time there are worms all over the court yard on walls,also near the pool ,in the pool. The day I left ,I left message for the manager to call me. He called and said he would give me a discount on my stay, that I have yet to see.
