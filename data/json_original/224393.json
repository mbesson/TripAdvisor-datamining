Also, the staff did have the decency to look pretty embarrassed about everything else that happened below:- Bad Points: when I arrived I noticed that the entire ground floor smelt of curry, whilst my room which was on the top floor (six flights of stairs - no lift) smelt of ' armpits'. The bedroom was slightly bigger than the double bed which was covered in a sheet and light quilt but no duvet. The room was cramped, dirty and dishevelled. The bed linen was far from inspiring. The window was not double glazed and very draughty. The radiator was functioning at approximately 10% capacity and the room was freezing. I realised that the smell of armpits was due to the fact that all previous occupants had probably slept in their clothes. The ensuite shower room (ha ha!) Was also unheated, dirty and mouldy. The toilet paper was actually stored in the wardrobe in the main bedroom because there was not room in the tiny shower room for a loo roll dispenser. I went to bed at around 10 PM having donned several spare layers of clothing and decided to chance the rather dubious looking spare blanket which resided on top of the flimsy (sub MFI) wardrobe. At around 2.30 a.m I became aware of a commotion outside the door to my room involving a number of excited residents. I was unable to decide if the door knocking was in respect of my own room or other residents of the same floor as each of the doorways were so close together and I decided not to answer my door. At 3.15 a.m. I heard a key in the door to my room and the night Porter entered in his nightclothes. He explained (in very broken English) that he had been sleeping on the floor in reception and that water had been flowing down the walls and over the fax machine due to an overflow. He thought it started in my room. He flushed the toilet in my ensuite several times and seemed to apologise for the intrusion. I tried to go back to sleep. At 3.45 a.m. my door opened again (this time with only one knock) to reveal three Asian gentlemen armed with a screwdriver who seemed to want to inspect my ensuite toilet once again. At this time they did not seem to find any problems with my toilet and left my bedroom after saying a number of things which I did not understand. At 7.00 a.m. I got up after the coldest and most interrupted night I have ever experienced in any country to discover that there was not only no heating in my room but also no heating of the hot water in the shower (there was tepid water available in the sink). I had to shower in ice-cold water and decided to skip the continental breakfast! Finally, I just have to say that I am afraid that this hotel provided the worst nights accommodation I have ever experienced in anycountry - at least in backpackers hostels in southern Europe you do not have too wear your clothes to bed!", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cYou are in London!

Before departure, I search a lot to manage my money to get the best quality from the lowest money spending. Before leaving to London I searched many sites and read reviews. With all bad reviews about Park Hotel lastly I decided to stay here for 2 nights for the following reasons: 1. Many of London\u2019s sightseeing are in walking distance. So, I saved for transportation cost. 2. I was leaving hotel in the morning and coming back late night. What I wanted was a basic breakfast, clean bed, clean toilet and hot shower which was included the rate. 3. I traveled in January when is off-season and hotel offered me a good price (29 Pound per night for ensuit room and basic breakfast) Luckily my room was a double bed. Still small and old but I could move! Hotel has a wireless internet zone but I didn\u2019t use. If you stay here remember: 1. I saw the pictures of other guests some rooms were very shady. My room was 219. It was ok compared to those pictures. But window was broken and I cut my finger while trying to shut it. Finally, I couldn\u2019t! 2. Ask the reception to switch on the heater at night. 3. My room doesn\u2019t have cooling system. So for summer might be a problem 4. I saw some scary pictures of other guests here in Trip Advisor bit by bedbugs. I didn\u2019t see any. They were not around because of winter!? 5. When open the tap in the shower room be patient! Hot water will come after 10 minutes! 6. Hotel doesn\u2019t have lift and stairs are narrow. 7. Hotel runs by 2 staff. One is reception and one is multifunction! 8. During the pick-season rates increase up to 66 Pound to 160 Pound! Unbelievable! But I think other hotels also increase their price! So still Park Hotel will be cheaper. 9. I saw about 50 B&B in Belgrave and Warwick area. But all look same size and same quality. If one of them is a bit better in service then the price will increase. 10. Definitely, owner knows about many deficiencies in his hotel but also he knows travelers can not find a cheaper hotel in London. So, why to spend money for improving it!? 11. Don\u2019t miss the Cypriot/Turkish restaurant in Warwick 5 min by walk from Park hotel. And finally: 12.

The hotel was obviously low-budget, and we know that price is relative to quality at times so I guess we weren't expecting top notch quality.. BUT to witness a hotel being run under such poor hygiene standards is just absolutely shocking. Firstly, the room was awful; extractor fan on the window which had been stuck together by tape essentially, a carpet and bed cover which were absolutely hideous, shoddy electrics; my friend tried turning on the tv with a remote, as you do of course, and that wouldn't work, so we then tried to turn the light switch off to go to bed and that turned out to be the trigger for the tv to turn on! BUT the worst part of it all BY FAR was the number of BED BUGS we found, and the reaction/\"damage control\" of the staff.. We found bed bugs of all sizes, from small undeveloped ones, to ones who have bitten people before (we then discovered they grow with the more blood they have). We squished a few and saw the blood coming out as we did.. was as gross as it sounds, and to be honest i don't know how this hotel still operates under those circumstances... anyway I then proceeded to making a complaint to reception, and demanded a full refund. Person at reception dealt with this terribly, as he actually said we would have to wait till the nxt day to talk to the manager, even though he admitted from the very first second that yes, they have been having problems with bed bugs. In fact his reaction to my question of whether they had beg bugs was: \"What room are you in?\" Very reassuring what can I say!! Anyway after a long conversation and a lot of frustration later, we decided to take his offer of a different room as my friend and I were exhausted and didn't know where else to go.

So at least I had somewhere to hang my clothes! The \"Tea and coffee making facilites\" was comprised of a kettle that didn't work, and out of date dried coffee and tea amongst toe nail clippings and hair.

I had no choice but to leave after the first night. The issues I encountered were as follows: CLEANING The hotel was generally unclean, and the room I was given (# 7) in particular was filthy: 1) The balcony outside the room was littered with cigarette butts and other rubbish 2) The carpet in the room was soiled, shabby and had not been vacuumed 3) The draws of the bedside were covered in stains 4) The bed linen was torn and stained 5) The room had a stench of dampness 6) Due to concerns regarding cleanliness of the room, I felt uncomfortable about the hygiene risks of using the bed. Instead I kept my clothes on, covered the bedding with spare clothes and slept rather uncomfortably in that state. 7) The floor, hand basin, toilet and shower unit in the bathroom so dirty I was not able to make use of the bathroom at all. MAINTENANCE The overall standard of maintenance of the hotel and my room (# 7) was very poor: 1) There were large holes punched in the walls that had not been repaired 2) The plumbing made an extremely loud noise for at least 2 minutes after I or occupants of other rooms flushed the toilet 3) The wardrobe unit was flimsy, unstable and had folded up maps jammed underneath it to prevent it from falling over INTERNET WiFi internet service was offered at 3 pounds per day. This worked well on the first evening of my stay, however on the following morning it was impossible to access the internet, and shortly after the WiFi router was switched off altogether by the person on duty at reception. Note that there are other free WiFi internet services with good signal strength that can be accessed from the room I was staying in. It was from there I made a booking for another hotel which is less expensive and much nicer. BATHROOM In addition to being unclean, the bathroom was dilapidated and extremely small. Sitting on the toilet in an upright position was impossible as the hand basin was located in such a position to prevent this. The shower unit was big enough for a small child at best, not that I would not subject a child (or anyone else) to using the bathroom in the first instance. RUDE SERVICE I encountered several problems with the person on duty at reception: 1) He accused me of over-using the WiFi service and causing it to fail (anyone with any technical knowledge of internet technology would know this is a ridiculous accusation) 2) He demanded that I \"SPEAK LOUDER\" when discussing the issue of payment for the WiFi service. Note that I had concerns about the reliability of the internet service when I checked in due to the shabby state of the hotel reception area, and was provided the access password in advance to ensure the system would work. The \"SPEAK LOUDER\" incident occurred after the WiFi service had stopped working. 3) When I enquired as to how long it would be before the internet service would be restored I was given the response \"I don't know\". I asked whether it might be an hour, the morning, the day... still the answer was \"I don't know\". 4) When checking out I attempted to advise the manager of these issues. He spoke over me and never gave me the opportunity to explain my reasons for checking out early. BREAKFAST Breakfast was offered for 2 pounds. All that was available was corn flakes, rice bubbles, orange juice, coffee, bread and some spreads. It was poorest breakfast I have ever seen, let alone for a hotel. DEMAND FOR FURTHER PAYMENT / REFUND REFUSAL When I informed the manager that I was leaving, he demanded payment for the WiFi internet service (which had failed by this time) and the breakfast (which as stated above was completely unsatisfactory). The manager stated nonetheless that I should pay for these services. Furthermore, even though the manager was fully aware that no refund was available upon early checkout for the remaining two days booked, he stated that I should contact expedia.com to seek a refund. This was an obvious, outright and extremely insulting lie. Given the hotel had received payment for the following two nights of the booking, the WiFi service had failed, the breakfast was unacceptable and I had paid for two unused nights of accommodation I refused to pay for these services, and even then felt very much ripped off!

We were given our room and when we got into it we could not believe our eyes....the room was tiny, smelled and didnt appear very clean at all! On a closer inspection the bed looked like it hadnt been changed in weeks, the toilet was absolutely tiny - It actually looked like a portaloo had been stuck onto the side of the room, but also managed to fit a shower and a sink, so it was impossible to move in it. The light in the toilet was hanging off, which is pretty dangerous considering its surrounded by water. The mould and grime on the window/door was revolting (please look at my pictures), and when the bedside drawer was opened we were faced with a half eaten jar of jam, tub of nutella and lots of crumbs! This proved that the room hadnt been cleaned properly for our arrival! :-( The room also had no lock on the door from the inside, so you wouldnt have felt safe during the night. We left our luggage in the hotel, and went to enjoy the start of our holiday. The hotel makes you leave your key at the reception which on looking back was a bad sign. After we left we decided that we couldnt stay there, so we phoned the hotel and they agreed to change our room when we got back from our day out. When we arrived back at the hotel, the receptionist, still as happy as ever, told us that he had moved all our luggage to a different room, in a DIFFERENT HOTEL without informing us. We tried to kick up a fuss about it as they had done this without telling us anything, when they did have a contact number to do so, but the man was extremely rude and didnt see what was so wrong with what he had done. I asked to look in the room which we were in, to ensure that no personal belongings had been missed, but he wouldnt let us, and said the room was being used by other guests already, which i highly doubt because nobody could stay there. He then told us to follow him to the other hotel, and whilst following him, he never said a word to us, not a single sorry passed his lips. On arriving at the other hotel, and after being shown our room - which was no better, i asked the man for his name incase anything turned out to be missing. He told us that we had to check our luggage infront of him to ensure that nothing was missing, and that as soon as he left he was not being held responsible for anything. I kept asking him for his name, which he refused to give us, and would only give us his managers name and the hotels phone number. He then walked out and left us to it. Still no apology! :-( We decided that we couldnt stay in the new hotel either as it was just as unclean. This one was called the Corbigoe Hotel. So we decided to find another hotel and stay there.

Needless to say, it was a squeeze trying to shower and not bang one's elbows on the surrounding walls, or to use the toilet without banging against the unlockable door. It is high time for the piping system to be replaced as there were loud sounds whenever the taps are open and funny smells ensued from the water outlet. Breakfast was simple but sufficient - unlimited amounts of orange juice, coffee, tea, toast, cereals.

Our first impression was VERY LOW BUDGET, but we had accepted it would probably be cheap and nasty when we booked - and we had decided the location was worth the risk. I can still remember the room and its problems even now. I get a chill down my spine thinking of it. Here's a list of what was wrong: 1) My wife pulled back the bedsheets and found a used band-aid. So much for clean sheets! We slept in sleeping bags instead on top of the bed. The beds were also awful. I'm sure they must have been on Noah's Ark. 2) Our room was right below the entrance. Every time (lasting until 2am in the morning) when someone entered the hotel above us, we were all woken by the creaking floor above. 3) The shower/toilet/basin made it possible to simultaneously shower, do a #2 and clean your teeth at the same time. Not that we did, but it was the first (and only) such bathroom where this would be theroretically possible that we have seen. 4) On the subject of the bathroom - a furry mould grew in it, and water leaked out of it into the room at the rate that the Thames River discharges into the sea. 5) The TV was precariously placed on a wardrobe. I refused to sleep under it because I felt that either the TV would fall down, or the wardrobe would collapse - either case leading to a visit to the Royal London Hospital if it happened. I was frankly amazed that the TV was in colour given its age. 6) Some rude staff. One of the staff members would abuse his cleaning staff in front of guests for being 2 minutes late. Very unprofessional, and also uncomfortable. 7) Stairs down to our room were so narrow I had to go down sideways. I am not overweight. The width of the stairwell would have been approximately 40-50cm. So far... 7 points against. The only plus is the location. We did stick it out for our full 5 nights, though, as we didn't have the money to book a better place. I'm not quite sure what ill effects I suffer to this day after staying there - but I'm sure there must be something. No one could stay in a place like that and not pick up some disease/fungus.

Yeah? Not one review I have read on this site even comes close to describing the horror of this place. We booked it to have a hotel near to victoria station, therefore handy for the underground. It was, to be fair, quite close to victoria station, although at least 15 hotels are closer. We found our room, un-cleaned at 3pm, to be about as big as most standard box rooms in student flats. The TV was hanging onto the wall for dear life by a bracket that doubled as a wardrobe. There was a gap of about 2 inches between the bed and the walls. The bathroom was essentially a large plastic sink, walled into the corner of an already small room with the pleasant odour of mildew eminating from within. The hot water outlet had no tap, so just poured out onto the floor. The shower took around 15 minutes to warm up.

The first place we try is the Corbigoe Hotel, 101 Belgrave Road. They tell my partner it will \u00c2\u00a395 to stay the one night. After a 3 mintue haggle, we managed to get it down to \u00c2\u00a345. We weren't expecting much, just a place to lie our heads down for the night with the basic needs one expects in a country such as England. So, we were told to walk down to number 64 Belgrave road...which was indeed the Park Hotel. We were 'greeted' by a very rude Pakistani man who tried to say the agreed price was not \u00c2\u00a345 but higher and was playing games. As it was 3:00 am we were not in the mood for this, we just wanted to sleep...however, we insisted he calls his colleague at the Corbigoe Hotel. He reluctantly did so and then mumbles to us 'ok , but three pounds extra for paying by debit card'. 'Hmm' we thought, ok fine , whatever. So we get given our key to room 205 (right next door to reception) Once we entered that room, we could not believe our eyes. You could argue: well what do u expect if u pay \u00c2\u00a345 for a hotel in central London. But this is no exaggeration, this place was a flea pit, stinking, crumbling, health hazardous hell hole of a room. We actaully laughed in disbelief. Then we opened a scummy looking door to what the hotel refers to as the bathroom. Imagine you are in Delhi, find the most poverty-stricken neighbourhood you can find, then go into the dirtiest looking restaurant u can find then ask to use the 'bathroom''. I could safely say hand on my heart, the bathroom in Delhi would be cleaner and more efficient than this one in London, at the Park Hotel. I immediately pulled the bed sheets off as I expected them to also be filthy. This is the only aspect whichI was not horrified at. The bed linen was relatively clean and fresh smelling. After seeing the room how it was I expected the bed linen be soiled in something nasty to keep in theme with the rest of the room. Phew, we thought, maybe we could just survive it until check out at noon. As we got ready for bed, and took our socks off we suddenly felt that our feet were damp. The carpet in the room was sopping wet! I knelt down to see if it was cleaning solution but instead I got a whiff of a rancid stench. Yummy! The only place I felt relatively safe was in the bed, but with the worry that the light which was directly above our bed , which was hanging by a string and could potentially drop at any moment and kill us! After actually dismantling the light ourselves so we could rest, we prepared to sleep. At around 5 am we were woken to the sounds of doors banging and people leaving and various other peculiar sounds. This was not really a big deal to me. I am still in shock how a hotel of this atrocious standard can be allowed to take business as it really is not only below standard, it is seriously dangerous. We checked out a noon which was the agreed time and we were aggresively asked by the man at reception to pay \u00c2\u00a310 for checking out 'late' .Needless to say there was no way were were parting with more money. This place is not worth even 2 pence for a years stay. I said to the man how shocked I was that this hotel can exist how it is, not to mention putting their prices at \u00c2\u00a395 before negotation. He then shouted back at me that I should stay at the holiday inn if I wanted a shower that worked. Hmm, interesting. We have found the whole experience quite amusing, what else can u do? I am just writing this so that anyone thinking of using this hotel, my advice.... you would be better off buying a sleeping bag from millets and finding yourself a park bench. You'd have fresh air, it's free (minus the sleeping bag cost) and you'd be cleaner by not washing in this hotel, and even if you stay in the clothes you have been wearing for over a month, walked through a swamp, and rolled around in pigs pooh....You'd still be cleaner and have had a more pleasent experience than at this DUMP of a 'hotel' Dont stay at this dreadful place!

We didn\u00c2\u00b4t object as we thought the alternative could hardly be worse than the Park Hotel. So we wound up att the Carbigoe Hotel att 101 Belgrave Road. There we met the only positive part of the whole experience: a rather nice gentleman in the reception. The room was tiny, the shower certainly had both hot and cold water, but the water came mainly out of the tubing as the showerhead was clogged. Two out of four lights in the room and bathroom worked. The bed did have clean sheets, but the rest of the room was dirty, wall-to-wall carpeting of dubious colour, drapes that were graying from dust, ingrown dirt in the bathroom; no one knows what hid under the bed, we certainly didn\u00c2\u00b4t look and I\u00c2\u00b4m quite sure nobody else has for years and years. In spite of it all (and thanks to the clean sheets!) we decided to stay the two nights we\u00c2\u00b4d already paid for and not let the sorry state of the hotel destroy our visit to London, rather take it as a lesson for the future. But please, if you can avoid our mistake, search for another hotel, there are lots of them i London, not all clean, but hardly any in sorrier state than the Park-Carbigoe!", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary", "Title": "\u201cThe Park Hotel, Nightmare in London\u201d", "Author": "robbyo", "ReviewID": "UR3794940", "Content": "We found our hotel which was nothing like the description on the Expedia site. It was, at that time, described as a cosy, family run Hotel. It was dingy and small and had no heat, We had booked a month early and Expedia had charged us the rent in advance otherwise we would have left and found some place else. They tried to give us a room in the basement we argued with them and then they tried to put us into a room on the first floor. That room was small with a double bed filling the space. The room had a narrow corridoe leading to a grimy window looking out to a light shaft. The corridor was being used to store, upended single beds, making it impossible to get to the window. We finally got a room on the third floor overlooking the grimy rooftops. Of course no lift. The room was dirty the window was so filthy that you could hardly look out of it. The blankets were so dirty we wouldn't sleep under them. The room was freezing cold. We went out for some supper and I told the receptionist that the radiator wasn't working and she assured me she would have someone fix it. When we returned to the room it was still icy cold and the radiator was like a fridge. I went back down to the reeception to encounter a new person who informed me that they can't get an electrician at night....the radiator is supposed to be steam. He offered to give me an extra blanket. We couldn't/wouldn't use the filthy one we already had. I noticed the reception area was toasty warm and saw that it was being warmed by a couple of electric heaters. I demanded one of the them and he agreed and actually carried it up to the room and plugged it in. We spent the night, fully clothed lying on top of the bed. The shower was so small and filthy we wouldn't use it and the toilet flushed only after repeated flushing. We certainly suggest that if anyone is considering this hotel...don't.", "Date": "August 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester,uk", "Title": "\u201cStay Away\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3706336", "Content": "All the other reviews seem to be telling the truth, pay a bit extra and stay somewhere else .Oh and yes there are bed bugs.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malmoe, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cStay in a Park instead\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3607365", "Content": "Stay somewhere else, please!", "Date": "June 23, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Park Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d224393-Reviews-Park_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$97 - $548*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">64 Belgrave Rd, Victoria</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW1V 2BP</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "224393", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e9/ab/e9abca1a15eed7b5a3de9765b5ea5e564large.jpg"}}
