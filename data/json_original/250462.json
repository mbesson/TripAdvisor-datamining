We were 2 persons. As I booked the hotel only 10 days before the arrival, of course, I lost good promotions in Berlin. Berolina wanted non-refundable 45 Eu/night. Not so bad for 2 persons. Pros: - Good price for 3 star hotel in Berlin. We had a normal room with 2 twin beds with en-suite. - Location was convenient. This is not central Berlin. The hotel is located in 150 meters from Adlersdorf S-Bahn station, 2 min walk. S9 and S45 trains stop there. Both lines end with Schonefeld Airport station (3 stops from Adlersdorf). Or you can take the opposite direction and travel on S9 to Ostkreuz. There you just change trains and get to the center of Berlin. It takes about 20 - 25 mins to get from Adlersdorf to Alexanderplatz. Not so far. - There are some restaurants close to the hotel, for example, Hong Kong Haus. But it's better and cheaper to eat in the center. Cons: - The railway is located just opposite the hotel, in 70 meters. The traffic is rather intensive. If you have rooms facing to the railway, it can be noisy from trains, especially from 7 am till 11 pm. When you book, ask to give you a room facing to the yard. It's okay. I was lucky, I got it!!! - Sometimes you hear the noise from the people who loudly speak in the corridor. - Small 14\" TV with 12 programs in German only. Advice: - If you want to get to Potsdam, just take S9 or S45 to Schonefeld (3 stops). There you need to change to RE22 train. RE22 departs hourly. It takes about 1 hr to get to Potsdam from Adlersdorf. Alternatively, you can get to Potsdam from Central Berlin on S7. - If you want to get to Sanssouci Palace, you can take bus # 695 from Potsdam station or a bus from Sanssouci Park station (a couple of stops before Potsdam Hbf, RE 22 from Schonefeld). - Also remember that Adlersdorf is in B-transportation zone. Schonefeld airport, Sanssouci Park and Potsdam are in C-zone. - If you travel from Tegel airport, this is B-zone. From Tegel you need to take buses ## 609 or X9 (express) to Zoologischer Garten S - U - bahn Stations or bus # TXL to Berlin Hbf or Alexanderplatz S - U bahn stations. From there you can easily get to the hotel.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds", "Title": "\u201cNot worthy of 3 stars\u201d", "Author": "JollieRockhopper", "ReviewID": "UR119935809", "Content": "Stayed here for one night as needed hotel clode to airport. In it's favour, the place was very clean and tidy, our room was small and faced directly opposite the train station and so was very noisy. Despite the hotel being almost empty, a request to change rooms was refused. The room was furnished entirely by IKEA, the beds were very small and the shower sealant was covered with mildew! I would not recommend the 10 Euro per head breakfast. We were told at reception that we could order a cooked breakfast, however this request was met with a flat refusal -also do not make the mistake of imagining that you can eat the bread and jam they do provide in your room, Iwas prevented from leaving the breakfast room by a very aggressive member of staff who shouted in my face, grabbed my arm and took the plate from me!! I was so embarrassed and also very angry that I had paid 10 Euros for a cup of coffee !!! I was also concerned that the hotel reception was unmanned between 12 midnight and 7am.As we were leaving i overheard a new guest being told that WiFi access is 10 Euros PER HOUR and also that parking is 10 Euros per night. The area is dirty and i would feel unsafe alone outside at night. All in all not a pleasant stay. and one we will never repeat. We paid 70 Euros for one night and feel this hotel does not either represent good value for money, nor is it worthy of 3 star status.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cLook for somewhere else\u201d", "Author": "Jon4001", "ReviewID": "UR117068867", "Content": "Stayed here for one night as a convenient hotle near the airport. Well it cost about 15 euros in a taxi so it prehaps isnt that convenient. The room was pleasant enough for a budget room but is below the standard of a travelodge in engalnd - for those reading who are english and require a barometer. The room did have a major flaw in one respect, hence the bad review; the curtains in the room did not close and were wafer thin.

It is far from the city center but easy accessible; the area it is in is rather all right, the staff is very helpful. A big plus is its proximity to the S-Bahn Adlershof (by the way, the dirtiest and ugliest S-Bahn station I've ever seen in my life - shame on you, tidy Germans!), as well as to several restaurants nearby and a big shopping center (Sch\u00f6neweide - some 2 km in direction city center). The minus of the hotel is simply the fact that it is overrated. Regarding the room standard it is a very decent two-star-hotel, but hardly anything more. The beds are all right, the room is spacious enough, as well; nevertheless, the small Nokia-TV, quite ageing furniture, lack of hairdryer and the overall ambient of the hotel (clear signs of its roots in the Erich-Honecker-period) do not allow its official rating to be taken seriously.
