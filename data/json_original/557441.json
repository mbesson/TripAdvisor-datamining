I do recommend that if you plan to send post cards to the US, buy some stamps at the airport before you get to the cusoms area. I found most shops had stamps for EU mail, but not for US mail.

I just wish I had checked my room first. I was allocated room No 15 (a single). It was uncomfortably small - the toilet, wash-hand basin and shower were all crammed into one tiny room. I complained to the manager, who agreed to allocate me a different room the following day (that night, he said, they were full). But to be honest, the second room wasn't a great deal better. Then there are the stairs. They are very steep and narrow, bordering on the dangerous. One bannister was at first loose, then broken off the wall. What made my five-night stay all the more galling was the fact that it was NOT what I would call cheap for the standard provided: I paid 443 Euros for the 5 nights (that's 87 Euros, or about 53 GBP, per night for just one person). Dreadful value for money. So, my advice is: spend just a bit more and get somewhere decent. But if you must stay here, check your room first.

It is, as most residential buildings in the area would be, extremely narrow. The bedroom we had was on the top floor and upon our arrival we realised we should have packed a rope to haul ourselves up the tiny and very steep stairs. Obviously not recommeneded for those with a mobility problem. The bedroom was booked as a double room but it was made up of two twin beds pushed together although still with a rather large gap in between. There was very little room to move around the bed or to put luggage but it had clearly been recently decorated in a modern, neutral style and was very clean and tidy. The showerroom was the source of much entertainment. It was wet-room style and the shower was practically over the top of the toilet and the sink, guaranteeing shower gel on your toothbrush and soggy toilet tissue but again the bathroom has new fittings and was cleaned every day. The only minor problem we had was that the sink was blocked and would not drain so it was teeth cleaning and hand washing under the shower for us. The area was not particularly noisy and the hotel was ideally located for the park and one of the markets which are within a couple of minutes wander. It is also directly opposite a tram stop. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the breakfast room was well kept and pleasant with an enjoyable but simple breakfast provided. We were kindly offered the option of breakfast at different times as we had some time constraints. Overall I would be happy to stay here again, we were on a budget and got more than we expected. It is clean, comfortable and friendly.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGood choice\u201d", "Author": "waterwoman2002", "ReviewID": "UR6334999", "Content": "Booked hotel over the internet.

And also our room didnt have an openable window, the perplex window we did have looked right out to the reception so we at time couldnt open our curtains!!! i spoke to the owner and he said he had just bought the hotel like a week or so before we arrived so i think the service etc we recieved was better than previous guests have recieved, our shower was new and perfect(apparently its the best in the hotel!!!), our bed sheets were changed everyday as was our towels, we didnt even bother with the breakfast but we could practically hear the other guests eating theirs because our room was right above the kitchen/breakfast area.
