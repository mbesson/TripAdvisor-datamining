The night I arrived (a Friday) the young hip clerk informed me that there would be a party in the ballroom until 4am. It was only when I tried to sleep on the third floor that I realized why he told me - my bed was literally shaking with the beat of the music. I don't know what was worse....that or the drunken screaming outside the windows from the party people occupying the hotels two bars. Oh, maybe it was the drunk people who had snuck up to the third floor to look and loudly critique the artwork right outside my door. The fact that I was in Toronto for work and had to get up for a presentation the next day made me think that I was being unfair in my increasing hatred of this place. However, the next night, and the night after, while the parties in the ballroom were over before 4am the drunken street noise from the hotel bars and the loud art critiques outside my door continued. As well, the room I stayed in was certainly enjoyably arty, but getting rather worn and dated and the bathroom contained so tiny a sink my toothpaste tube was too big to rest on the edge. The elevator is super cool, a really old one with the decorative iron cage, but not at all helpful in the morning when trying to haul suitcases downstairs to grab a cab because the front desk people were unable to help me because they were literally (no lie) cleaning up vomit on the front steps from the party-goers the night before.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pezenas, France", "Title": "\u201chome away from home\u201d", "Author": "geemacman", "ReviewID": "UR125443387", "Content": "Besides being one of the most interesting boutique hotels in Toronto, the staff are excellent.

The concept is fun and interesting and you certainly feel like you're in the middle of everything. We stayed in the Lehtinen Lodge which is a beautifully designed room but super small. Which is no big deal if you're only going to be in the room to crash, but that wasn't the purpose of my visit. Hanging out in the room the only place to relax was on the bed, and with luggage and toiletries, the room got messy really fast. The cleanliness of the room was what was really surprising. Coming back from our afternoon out, our room had been cleaned but I'm pretty sure it was done by a teenager. The bed was made but it was messy and they left the half full glasses of wine and an ice bucket from the night before in which all the ice had clearly melted. Room service is also pretty much nonexistent, even thought there's a kitchen downstairs. You can order ice from the front desk and a fun option is preordering coffee for the morning. Unfortunately the coffee is terrible. So if you're a snob about coffee, skip it. The amenities in the room are great. They provide you with snacks, and the best fair trade chocolate in the world as well as bottled water and a bottle of wine, and the prices aren't as exorbitant as minibars usually are in hotels. They also provide you with ear plugs. With good reason. If you're a light sleeper, use them. Especially on the weekend. The staff are young and hip and much more professional than I expected from a hipster hotel (that's a good thing). We ate one night in the fine dining restaurant and the food was delicious and it's locally sourced and organic which it a huge plus. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. I loved being in a busy, fun, interesting neighbourhood and the art all over the hotel was also fabulous as was the historic value. If you're young and have money to burn and don't care about things like great service, then this is the place for you. But for my money, I would have liked more polished service. Which is disappointing because I think it's a great space.

For the price and the way it markets itself as an artsy hotel, I was expecting a lot and ended up being pretty disappointed. The quality of your stay greatly depends on the room you get. First, avoid rooms facing Queen Street or Gladstone Avenue, the noise is simply unbearable. At least the hotel has the decency to offer free ear plugs, but there's a good reason for it. On my first night I was in a room facing Queen, which had probably been given it's last face lift 15 years ago, and which for some reason had sheets that smelled like cigarette smoke. I complained the following morning about the smell of the sheets and was promptly offered free breakfast in their cafe (which makes a really good coffee btw) and given another room (which is why my rating is higher than it would otherwise be). I then spent three nights in a room at the back, facing Price Chopper, which was very quiet and very clean, but nothing to write home about.

Comfy beds, awesome morning cup of coffee, funky helpful but not overly effusive staff. Good service in the bar. Old style elevator. Only complaint is that if you have a lot of luggage, clomping up and down the stairs is a pain. You can easily have the staff ring the elevator, but that was too much of a bother for me. Rooms are small and location is also not central (although its Toronto and right on a streetcar route so what's the problem?) so these could be issues for some. I liked the artsiness of the rooms, but have seen more creative and funky decor. It wasn't quite my aesthetic but this isn't a complaint. Room was airy, peaceful and perfect for a night or two.

We arrived early, so our room was not ready just yet. The front desk clerk offered to hold our things while we had breakfast in there cafe and gave us a 10% off coupon. The food was superb and very responsibly priced. After about an hour our room was ready and the clerk came back to the cafe to take us upstairs. We were on the fourth floor and enjoyed our ride in the 100+year old elevator. This is the only elevator in the hotel, so guests staying here should be prepared to take the stairs. If you know that making multiple jaunts up and down the multiple flights is not for you be sure to ask for a room on a lower floor or just come with the mindset that you will need to wait for the elevator. The staff at the Gladstone is more than happy to run you up and down. Free wifi hotspots are all over the hotel and the service is very fast. This was perfect for us as we used it to make FaceTime calls to share the hotels art work to family that couldn't make the trip. We stayed in room 407 and found the atmosphere the artist created to be extremely tranquil. The tv and dvd player were stored in antique luggage. When the sun was out, we loved waking up to it streaming through our bedroom window. It was very difficult to checkout of our little slice of Eden! As comfortable as the Glastone makes your stay you will want to see the city of Toronto. It's very easy to catch a cab or street car (stops are right in front of the hotel). Again, the staff at the Gladstone does a superb job of giving directions and local suggestions on things to do and see in the area.

Here are some of the highlights: Pros The art gallery had wonderful art and the location of the hotel is in the best part of the city. The free morning coffees delivered to your door were also very much appreciated, as was the comfy bed. Another great advantage was the free wireless in the rooms. Cons The decor needed some sprucing up. The armoire door in our room was not hinged to the unit so that when I opened it, the door fell off of one of the hinges completely. The bathroom had some sort of tape that was used to create a decorative stripe across the walls but it was peeling away from the wall on the door frame (probably due to the moisture). Both the armoire and drawers/chest were placed on stacks of hardcover books to increase the height of the furniture, I'm guessing to match the scale of the room's ceilings, but it just looked tacky. The front desk staff were okay (check-in person was great) but some of the staff were a bit curt and only offered a minimum level of service (they made me feel like they were doing me a favor by doing their job). For example, the elevator requires an operator and there was never anyone there who was always available to operate it. You had to ask for someone, and when someone came, it was always like we were a pain for asking to use it. Consequently, we used the stairs while we were there. Check-out was the worst because the guy was super slow checking in another guest and chatting it up with her even though I was visibly in a hurry to leave (with my suitcase and everything). He did not apologize for dawdling and ignoring me, and it just left a horrible impression of the hotel. The bartender in the hotel bar was also slow to serve and did only the very minimum level of service. This is all while serving two other patrons in the entire bar. Just very odd. In a nutshell, this hotel is more for the kind of folk that like 'vintage' furniture from Salvation Army, don't mind paying boutique-hotel prices but not getting the usual corresponding attentive service, and don't need hotel robes or slippers.

They don't seem to have air-conditioned rooms as we had a stand alone unit in our room which was loud and wasn't able to keep up with 6 girls getting ready on a hot september day. House keeping didn't take away our dirty dishes when they cleaned our room. They left stale food sitting on dishes, so we just put them outside our door. We had breakfast in the bar twice, and it was really slow but the food was worth the wait! We observed other tables complaining to staff and even getting up and leaving. You have to wait for someone to take you up in the lift and there is not really anywhere for you to pull up and unload easily. Even with all of these inconveniences you can't help but realize that this might be by design and maybe instead of trying to rush around you should relax and admire this beautiful building and the art!

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by Ricardo who was very smiley and charming. The vibe is very unique and has tons of character. On one side of the lobby is a performance space that was having an open mike night. I later heard they have the best karoake in town. On the other side is the bar/restaurant. You definitely feel a lot of history walking in and it's been renovated in an artistic, funky style. We took the elevator up to our rooms - it's an old school elevator and needs the operator to bring you up/down. It's quite small so if you don't like confined spaces you might take the stairs! On each floor is a security door to all the rooms and a meeting space with lots of chairs that you can hang out with friends/colleagues. The hotel does do a lot of events so I appreciated that added level of security since lots of non-guests might be wondering around the open spaces. I had what was considered a bigger room and it was quite small - but it totally didn't matter! As you've seen on the site, each room is designed by a different artist. I walked in and felt like i was spending the night inside a gallery - super cool! I was in the Racine which had an amazing mural behind the bed and lots of the fixtures had the themes of \"roots\" - just like the name of the room suggests! One wall has a lots of little mirrors and the TV/DVD are hidden inside a huge stack of vintage suitcases. Bathroom was kind of dim but in the morning i just used the mirrors in the main space. I had a friend with me who stayed on a cot while I slept in the bed. It was pretty tight - but again - totally worth it, especially given the artistic vibe and the incredible room rate! We took the stairs up and down after our first trip up the elevator and got to walk through the literal gallery space on the second floor - a photo exhibit was taking place during our stay. Had drinks/dinner at the bar. delish. In the morning, I could see the train tracks and GO train which I felt added to the cool urban feel the place has.

This was our 1st time at the Gladstone and we'll definitely we going there again. We knew where the hotel was located in terms of distance to downtown, so we weren't taken aback by the 10-minute streetcar ride to our restaurant that evening. Even taking a cab back on a busy Saturday night cost only $15 from the King Street entertainment district. We stayed in Room 405, The Parlour of Twilight. It was very romantic & had a comfy king-size bed. Although I could see why a business traveler might find this hotel a little unusual, the noise level (again, on a Saturday night) was not bad at all. We heard about 30 seconds of loud voices the whole night (there was a dance & karaoke going on) and it certainly did not warrant using the provided earplugs. PROS: - Gorgeous, unique room - Prompt, un-stuffy service from the front desk (we called for ice delivery & the elevator and both arrived in under 2 minutes). Everyone we dealt with was very professional yet laid back and friendly. - Quick and easy check-in & check-out - Lovely organic soaps, shampoo and moisturizer provided - The hotel itself is filled with interesting art (we took a ton of photos) - Great brunch in the caf\u00c3\u00a9 (albeit slightly expensive). - Iron & ironing board available in my room to help recover my crumpled dress. - Amazing atmosphere & history in a beautiful building. CONS: - The shower in the room was TINY. I knew this from reading previous reviews, but I booked the room anyways because it was beautiful. That being said, it kinda sucks trying to avoid a concussion while trying to shave your legs (no bending over at all). The bathroom was fine otherwise. - I wasn't able to book that room online; I had to call in to specifically request it. On the website, it asks you to choose the room type and bed size and then it lists which rooms are available. Since this room has a king-size bed and the only options on the website were for a queen or double, Room 405 isn't listed as being available. I called in to ask about it and they were able to book me in right away. -Totally minor: There's a neon pink light fixture on the window of our room and it was not turned on for our whole stay.

We loved the character of the room, especially the exposed brick wall. The bathroom was small, however the vanity in the room provided additional space for getting ready. The hotel provides local handmade soaps and shampoos which was very cool. The biggest drawback was the shower size; you could turn around in it and that was about it. The safe was dated and not large enough to hold my average-sized laptop. Our room was not on the street so was quiet, and the bed & pillows were very comfortable. The building itself oozes with character. There's an old-fashioned elevator that has to be operated by an employee. My husband especially loved that feature. The floors have an open sitting area you walk through to get to your room. Great service all around, from the restaurant to front desk to housekeeping. The people at the front desk gave us some good recommendations of restaurants to try and helped us out with tickets to the transit system and how to use it. The housekeeper was very sweet and greeted us with a smile and hello every time we passed her. Our room was always very clean. Two of the three mornings we had breakfast at the Gladstone. The serving sizes and prices were reasonable and the food quality very high, with most of their food being locally sourced. My husband and I tried the frittata, bagel sandwich, and granola, all of which were outstanding. They also offer freshly squeezed juices. On the last morning we made the mistake of trying Eggspectations downtown - enormous servings of tasteless food. We wished we stuck with the Gladstone afterward, where we got better food and service for the same price or less! Parking is available in a store parking lot behind the hotel.

What struck us was that the room did have a flatscreen tv and a dvd/cd player, but not a coffeemaker, which was a pitty.In view of the location of the hotel (West Queenstreet, which runs from the beginning of downtown to the heart of it) there is a lot of traffic . Beside that there are lots of activities in the hotel bar(karaoke and music bands). We could hear all of that in our room, which was on the third floor. It took a little getting used to, but it didn't bother us at all. We considered it part of the vacation. It is a nice walk from the hotel to Chinatown on Spadina with lots of art galleries and small restaurants in Queenstreet. The staff was friendly and helpfull . Assistance with the luggage was no problem. The client centered service as a management philosophy was demonstrated when I discovered ( one hour after checkout when we were on our way to Kingston) that I had left my Ipod in our room.

I saw the rooms in their website and loved them. Although, the pictures are not real, the rooms are much much much smaller than they look like and completely different from the pictures. They are really tiny, ugly and the bathroom has a shoer cabinet so small that it looks like the one is a ship. The room they reserved to us had almost no windows and this terrible smell of cigarrete. I asked to chance it, what they did. The new room had only one window, that only had a fine curtain, what made me wake up at 6 in the morning every day, a great thing for a vacation. The room was also dirty, when I looked under the bed to pickup something that had rooled under it, I almost puked, it was absolutelly gross. There is no minibar in the room and they do not have room service, so if it\u00c2\u00b4s summer, drink you water mild!!! The toiletries are ridiculous, they offer you a shampoo, a soap and a wax (???) for the body in bars, they don\u00c2\u00b4t 'clean' and they don\u00c2\u00b4t smell nice. About the location, it is quite far from the city center, you cannot go walking to it, but there is a streetcar that stops in front of the hotel. They say they have a parking lot, but if fact they use the parking lot of the neighbout supermaket. They charge you 15 CAD a day to leave your car there, they do not help you take the luggage in and out of the car (you have to take it by yourself) and even if you paying for it, they ask you no to park 'in front of it, park behind it, not to take places from the customers', as the girl in the reception said me.

I booked the room rather late and so my room selection was limited to only 2 of the 27 'Classic' rooms offered, but I wanted a unique room rather than yet another typical \"Howard Johnson\" or \"Best Western\" plain, non-colorful room, so I took what I could get. From the location of the hotel, we weren't feeling overly confident that our stay would be very good...noisy Queen St. West in Toronto in not the prettiest part of town. But we stayed hopeful that inside would change our minds and it certainly did. Clean, classic 'old world' styling with art work and sculptures all over the place! Check in was easy and efficient with the staff super friendly and accommodating, even going as far as to remember I'd requested a more select room if one became available. Though no rooms had opened up, we were escorted up to our room in one of those super old elevator shafts where you can see all the mechanics involved and the safety gate closes over the door before going up - very fun!!! Our room was on the top floor which had a big central seating area with small couches and art work all over the walls. Our room was around the corner and not really knowing what to expect outside of the color-scheme, we said 'whatever happens, let's have fun!'. Our immediate reaction to the room was the size - very small....mind you, the giant king-size bed took up a huge portion of the room, so it was probably deceptive in size. The decor was totally retro - pink, purple, blue with a copper-gold tin ceiling. The bedding was satiny and sexy with a huge dark blue-gray velvet button head board running the whole length of the room. The bathroom was small but clean and the room had everything we needed for our short over-night stay. Had we been staying longer, we'd have definitely preferred one of the Gladstone's 'Gimme More' or 'Sweet Suites' room, but what we had was fine & fun for the one night! The hotel itself was super quiet...no annoying or noisy housekeeping waking up us at 8am, and even traffic was quiet with our room situated at the back of the hotel. The only noise was the air-con...a little rattly and a neighbourhood dog that wouldn't stop barking come 9am...but that's no fault of the hotel itself. The bed was comfy, had lots of pillows and definitely clean - no stains or funky-looking 'things' you find in other hotels. Perhaps the most pleasant part of our stay was that the entire building is smoke-free. As non-smokers, going into a room that has had smokers in it is repulsive. For the entire hotel to be free of stench, we were really impressed!! All in all, I'd totally be up for experiencing one of the bigger rooms at the Gladstone. Definitely hip & trendy and really not too far from the popular shopping districts of Toronto...by car, we were wherever we needed to be within 10-15 minutes (outside of rush hour traffic), and there were certainly lots of little eateries, bars/pubs right within walking distance. If you aren't looking for a huge hotel room and are up for trying new things, definitely check out the Gladstone.

What better place to stay than at The Gladstone? We've been to the Melody Bar dozens of times, but this is our first time staying at the hotel. We got a great deal online--- they put 2-3 rooms each night at a discount, so ours was $125, which really can't be beat for a cool boutique hotel in Toronto. We were looking at The Gladstone and The Drake, but this price couldn't be beat. Of course, the good price meant we didn't get to choose our room, but I requested a quieter room with a queen-sized bed and hoped that's what we'd get. We checked in around 3pm-- our room was on the 4th floor-- The Felt Room--- it was perfect--- bigger than I thought it would be--- contemporary and comfortable. The bathroom was small and unremarkable but spotlessly clean and just fine--- we were there to enjoy the city, not sit in the tub. The Gladstone has a great location for anyone who wants to be in the Queen West/Ossington area--- full of fantastic restaurants, arty-hipster bars and unique shops and galleries. The building is full of vintage charm and funky details (old elevator, etc.). The staff is super-friendly and seems genuinely happy to be there-- no phoniness whatsoever. The restaurant makes a reasonably-priced delicious breakfast with local ingredients. And on Thursday-Sat nights, they have the BEST karaoke bar in the world in the Melody Bar. Parking is a non-gouging $15/night. It all depends on what you're looking for---- if you want a huge bathroom, lots of quiet, huge hotel room, a more traditional 'hotel' experience and a more downtown location-- then maybe this isn't the right place for you. My only (very) minor 'criticisms' would be that the pillows were way too thick and puffy- ended up not using one--- (bed was very comfy). and there was also a big hum in the bathroom from the heating system--- we just shut the bathroom door to sleep- no big deal. Other than that we had a very quiet sleep--- they provide earplugs just in case. The whole place has a great vibe and we were 100% happy with our stay there--- will definitely stay there again when we go into Toronto.

The room we stayed in was quite small, but it was very clean, and much cheaper than the expensive Yorkville hotel we were going to choose. Very simple toiletries and few luxuries were available in the room, so perhaps this hotel isn't for someone who needs those type of \"things.\" Although the hotel does not seem to be in the best area at first glance, it actually has an eclectic group of shops, restaurants and bars just steps from the hotel. We had spent the afternoon on Queen ST. closer to Spadina, and wished we had realized what the Parkdale area (where the Gladstone is located) had to offer. Next time we'll spend more time there. We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant, which was excellent and very affordable. I had the pasta puttanesca and my husband had the gaspe tourtiere. The live music was an added bonus which made our meal even more enjoyable. Breakfast was equally delicious, but cost about $30 for the two of us. Then we ventured out on to the street, stopping at about 6 different bars. I've never seen such a diverse group of people being catered to in such a small area. It was a great sight, coming from the dulldrums of suburbia. Our night's sleep was very quiet and peaceful. Our room faced the north side of the hotel, away from the street and we were on the top floor so I'm not sure what a south facing room might be like. People were out on the street quite late. Public transit stops right outside the hotel and will take you to the entertainment and shopping areas within 5-10 minutes. There is a grocery store right behind the hotel if you need anything. You can get a bucket of ice and a mini-bar in your room on request (although we didn't request them.)

While the room we stayed in (Big Wood) was pretty cool and very clean, the rest of the experience was not very enjoyable. We found the location was just a few blocks too far away from the trendy shops that we went to check out. The area of the hotel, to us, seemed a bit seedy (homeless people, etc). Furthermore we were very disappointed that the parking was so poor. The hotel has zero parking. we were directed to a Price Chopper parking lot behind the hotel that had very poor lighting (in a seedy neighborhood) and there did not appear to be any security. What was most disappointing was the staff. we were greeted by a woman that seemed as though checking us in was a pain in her butt. Then to top it of we asked where we should go for shopping and she gave us a blank stare. She said \"um, I guess you could go out the front door and turn left or right\"- thanks Lady for that helpful nugget! That same night we asked the guy at the front desk where he suggested going for Italian food. He gave us a map and pointed us towards Little Italy (NOT!). He actually gave us directions to a a different Portuguese neighborhood just a few blocks away. We did not know we were a couple blocks off until much later that night after we had a very average meal at someplace we did not want to go. Then.. that night at 4am we were awaken by a ton of noise in the hallway. I looked up at the door form my bed and noticed that there were louvers above the door, so of course noise travels. This sucked! Top that off with tons of noise from the street. they gave us ear plugs, but that was not enough. That should have been our clue to switch rooms or hotels. The hotel is pretty funky- certainly lived up to that reputation, if only the staff was as interesting as the art on the walls!", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cAnd now for something completely different!\u201d", "Author": "Anglomontrealer55", "ReviewID": "UR50652944", "Content": "I am from Montreal and was totally unprepared for the Gladstone.

Unique elevator: Basically you have to have a staff member to operate it. Most people find it charming; being independent, I find this bothersome. We never used the elevator operator to get down, which is OK when you have nothing to carry. The room was relatively quiet, except the heating, which was extremely noisy - that is why earplugs were left in the room for us to use. The bed was hard, bedding quality (duvet, etc.) high.

I did mention a couple of times to the front desk staff but just wanted to reiterate. Although the staff were lovely & friendly & cool, one thing really annoyed me- I arrived at hotel at 3pm on 22nd Aug after a long flight, feeling jet lagged.Wanted to go for snooze and shower before heading out to meet a friend & explore but I was told my room would not be ready for 10 mins. I had a walk up the road to have a look and came back 50 mins later. I was told it still wasn't ready and would be another 20 mins. Bit disappointed but had another quick walk and came back after 20 mins exactly to be told it would be a further 15 mins. The guy on reception was very nice and got me an iced tea while I waited. 15 mins went by & another group waiting were told their room was ready. Nothing said about mine. 40 mins went by & no one had come to tell me it was ready. I went to reception & they gave me the key but said a maid would be round so I could go up and drop my bags in the room but would have to vacate when maid came to clean the room. Upon entering the room, it looked great and clean to me, I didn't think it needed linens changing-looked clean to me, but the maid told me on the way up she would be in soon. I waited for an hour and no sign of her. I couldn't have a sleep or shower incase she turned up. By this time it was 6pm and as I was only in Toronto for 2 days I decided to head out to explore anyway despite feeling exhausted and in need of a shower. When I got back later that evening,nothing had even been done to the room! I told the reception staff & it turned out that the room hadn't needed changing in the first place! Felt frustrated that I had been waiting 3 hours & nothing needed doing anyway & wasted time waiting when I could have been catching up on much needed sleep! Was pretty annoyed I couldn't shower and get ready properly to meet my friend as I felt pretty yucky from the flight. I was a bit disappointed that after having waited 3 hours (and could have been longer if I hadn't gone out) that nothing could be done to rectify this- after all, I had missed out on an afternoon that I had prepaid for. I felt especially annoyed as it had been prepaid for, so staff must have been aware I would arrive! I had a bottle of wine in the room and felt possibly this could have been reimbursed as a gesture to apologise but was told nothing could be done as I had booked through an agent. Quite disappointed in the service and although the hotel was gorgeous, and in the kind of arty area I liked to stay in, it seemed the staff are more concerned with the kudos of an arty hotel rather than providing a good and relaxing service and stay, I don't think I would stay again or recommened due to this. Bar seemed cool and lots of music events going on but no room service which was disappointing. The hotel was a lovely old building with original floor boards and an amazing old elevator, but these features, even with the individual artworks in each room, don't mean anything if the hotel service itself is not up to scratch. It felt a bit more like a posh hostel than a hotel. Which is fine if that's what you're after, but it's not clear on the website that's how it is.

It is likely to be less than satisfactory for travelers looking for the seamless luxury of a Ritz, or the preening stylishness of a W. This is a truly boutique hotel, whose every element is totally unique and not to be found anywhere else. Think of it as a strange hybrid of hotel, B&B, art gallery, commune, museum, and Beat-era coffeehouse. Be prepared for an adventure, an active stay, and (if you turn in before other denziens) use of (freely provided) earplugs, though, and you'll have a great time! As noted in every summary of this hotel, each room is a totally unique design put together by local artists/designers. My friend and I stayed in the Blue Line room (#318), which I think looks a bit better in photographs than in person. While kept very clean, it's clear that some guests have been less than gentle to some parts of the furniture (though any white foil finish is going to be put to the test holding up in a hotel environment). Designs in other rooms run from spare and contemporary, to lavishly retro, to out-and-out camp. The bed and pillows were excellent and comfortable, and the climate control was great. The organic, locally produced bath soaps and toiletries were wonderful -- I particularly enjoyed the solid shampoo/conditioner bar, although some guests might find it takes some getting used to. The shower was uncomfortably small, and would be very cramped for a larger or taller person. In spite of the come-hither silhouettes outlined on various walls, in other words, the shower is definitely one place you would not be having any sort of liasons in this room! I'd advise couples on a romantic visit to opt for a larger room with a full tub. The building is incredible, and has been very lovingly restored. The old manual-operated elevator is a distinctive touch, and the well-worn wood floors and super-sized windows add a vintage historic backdrop to the modern and funky art and designs showcased around the building. Each floor has a large common area, sometimes used for art classes, or, the weekend I was there, a course in burlesque! The food and drinks downstairs at the cafe and at the bar & restaurant were wonderfully tasty and fresh, and the neighborhood offers plenty of other options, from Pizza Pizza to Ethiopian. Speaking of the neighborhood, you'll find the Queen Street tramline right outside the door, as well as a bus running north up Gladstone Ave. There's a lot of wonderful boutiques, galleries, and spots to discover in the area as you head towards downtown. Maybe not ideal for itinerary-focused tourists (its about a 30-40 minute walk, 15 minute tram, or 10-15 CAD cab ride to the center of downtown), but great if you like a more unique and local scene. Arts and music are very big out in this area, and the bar downstairs hosts popular karaoke and live music events. The Drake Hotel down the street also has a popular music club. If the Drake crowd is a little bit more overt in its efforts to be fashionable, the Gladstone definitely sports a more friendly \"come as you are\" vibe. Old, young, in drag, in masks, in hawaiian shirts, in cowboy hats or hipster threads. The staff was good, with a few exceptionally helpful and friendly individuals. A few of their co-workers came off as either \"arrogant hipster\" types, or \"trying and failing to go above and beyond,\" but these were the exception rather than the rule!

We mentioned that we were interested in seeing a performance being held at the hotel unfortunately the hotel was sold out of tickets but the front desk staff went out of their way to find tickets for us at a local shop that was also selling tickets without us even having to ask. The room was very clean especially the shower (finally a hotel shower that I wasn't afraid to step in). The bed , pillowsand duvet were amazing! I cannot remember the last time that I slept so well. Parking was available right behind the hotel for $10 and we were able to buy a subway pass right at the hotel. We had breakfast at the hotel the next day and everything that we ordered was delicious (granola & yogurt, frittata, eggs). The burlesque show that we saw was very entertaining, and the karoke bar next door was also a lot of fun. We could have spent our entire stay at the hotel and we would not have been bored. I am looking forward to returning hopefully for a longer stay.", "Date": "July 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cThe Gladstone is THE Destination for Funky and Unique!\u201d", "Author": "andrawatkins", "ReviewID": "UR35694731", "Content": "We booked the Refresh Suite at the Gladstone to celebrate our 5th anniversary. Unlike other hotels, the Gladstone has artist designed rooms that each have a different theme. Upon booking, we submitted our top 5 selections, and the staff assigned us what was available. Despite sounding labor intensive, it was a relatively easy process. At check-in, the staff was extremely helpful and included welcome vouchers for the restaurant and bar that we could use immediately. Adjacent parking was easily arranged at the front desk, who made sure that we had proper details for display in the car. The staff also warned us that a large event would be held on site that night and asked us to let them know immediately if it was too noisy. We never heard a thing. Our room, the Refresh Suite, was well appointed, clean and comfortable. The linens were high thread count, with perfectly firm mattress and pillows. The organic bath products were awesome, and the public areas outside our room were quiet and cozy. This hotel also includes exhibits in each public hall, and we enjoyed the Canadian architecture show that was up while we were there. The restaurant and bar on site was excellent - a great place to relax and people watch. Both the breakfasts each day and the dinner we sampled there were tasty and well presented. It was a fabulous alternative for tired people who flew and then drove for most of the day. The neighborhood around the Gladstone is transitional, with construction going on across the street. We heard no noise from the site. Containing galleries, hip shops and restaurants, the area is a fun and interesting place to walk. The trolley cars also run back and forth along Queen Street, easily accessible to anyone tired of walking. Our favorite neighborhood find was a restaurant called Odd Fellows. My only complaint about the Gladstone is the lack of an I Pod player in the room. Mod hotels are providing these standard now. When we requested one, the staff sent up an antiquated tiny clock radio with a cord jack for playing the I Pod. It was useless. Hopefully, future visitors will find a suitable I Pod appliance in each room. The Gladstone is an interesting hotel concept that I hope to encounter again in the future. I recommend it highly as a welcome alternative to the \"usual.\"", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFun, funky, set in a beautiful grand old building\u201d", "Author": "Mrs-Moondog", "ReviewID": "UR31383219", "Content": "This hotel has a different feel from the the norm.

The street car stops right outside, and tickets can be bought at the hotel, so very handy. So even though it's not in the heart of town this is not a problem.

The 100 year old elevator is really different, and so is the cowboy that operates it - you don't get that at the Hilton, and I loved it. Also, as an added bonus for me - they have vegan breakfast in the cafe downstairs. I had the tofu scamble and coconut chai latte, and it was the best breakfast ever. There is a bar downstairs, but the noise did not bother us at all, and for those who care there are earplugs provided in the room.

Staying at the Gladstone is an experience in itself. Each room has been decorated by a different artist and is unique in decor. The standard rooms are small, but more than adequate for couples. I would not recommend this hotel for families or business travellers, and I cannot imagine that is the target market of the Gladstone. The rooms are extremely clean and well maintained. Noise is a bit of a mystery. As some reviewers have mentioned, you can hear other guests very clearly when they are in the halls. So we wondered about the noise between rooms. We heard nothing all night, and were surprised to find that the room adjacent to ours had been occupied, as we saw the staff cleaning the room. Either the rooms are very soundproof, or the couple next to us tipped-toed in and out of their room. The Cafe is wonderful, serving perhaps the best americano I have had in recent memory. And take time to enjoy the art that is everywhere. The light fixtures in the cafe are each a piece of art created from tacky old lamps that we have all seen in a living room in the seventies. Try the vegan chocolate avocado tart (I'm not even a vegatarian, let alone vegan)! Yes the elevator is a bit dated, but it adds to the charm of this hotel that dates back to the 1800s. The elevator is 104 years old! Art is everywhere. The best part of our stay was the staff. Extremely friendly and seemingly would bend over backward for us. The area the hotel is located looks a bit seedy, but this is Toronto folks. I would have no problem walking around, and in fact made a brief trek down the street after dark. So if you prefer to wake up in the morning and not know whether you are in a Hilton or a Holiday Inn; if you prefer art on the walls that is mass-produced; if you prefered hotel employees dressed in ill- fitting uniforms; and if you need a door on your closet: by all means, pick another hotel. The Gladstone is unique in every way, including its eclectic collection of seemingly very happy employees. I can't wait to go back. The Gladstone will be a regular stop for us from now on. So \"glad' we found it. (Sorry for the bad humour, just couldn't resist).
