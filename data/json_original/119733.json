Not the quality I had become accustomed to. Rates were as good as I could find in this area, plus there is free parking available. The location is a bit odd-- there four hotels at this corner, but you will definitely need a car. This property is old and dingy, and has not been properly renovated. Lobby and breakfast area are a bit dated and cheap. There is a pool in the middle of a parking lot and a small fitness area. There is one small workstation and free wi-fi in the rooms. Breakfast was the usual Hampton stuff--- lousy even for free. Desk staff was reasonable helpful. Now for the rooms. They are very plain for a Hampton. Definitely the sparest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. The furniture is cheap and sparse, d\u00c3\u00a9cor is extremely plain. Over the tiny window, you can either open the drapes completely or sit in darkness. There is no view to speak of from any rooms. There is no fridge. Most annoying of all, there is a very distinct odor in both the rooms and the halls. Carpets are absolutely filthy-- your feet will literally STICK to the floor (yes, stick). And then I saw the reason\u00e2\u20ac\u201din order to fight the musty odor, housekeeping staff have been asked to spray Febreze in every room every time. Attention management: this stuff does not go away, becomes stickier and stickier on the carpet, the rooms smell more, then need more deodorizing, etc. You need to TEAR IT OUT, not spray slime on it. There is nothing to see at this exact location, nor anywhere to eat, though you can easily get downtown or to the beaches in fifteen minutes. Freeway is two minutes from the door. To get my rate, I had to pay in advance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat was a mistake, as I could not depart early under this non-refundable rate.

My wife had previously worked in La Jolla and so we wanted to stay here rather than San Diego proper. We wanted something with a reasonable degree of comfort and a reasonable price - not easy to do around San Diego in the summer! On the whole, we really liked it. There were plenty of kids around because of a synchro swimming competition in town, so the place was quite lively but it did not seem noisy or too busy. The rooms were a decent size, with good firm beds and a bath. We were allowed to check-in early by the gracious lady at the front-desk, and walked to the Valley Centre (0.5 miles) for lunch. We had an OK buffet curry but there were several other options. The pool and the gym were quiet that Friday afternoon, and were small but acceptable. On our final night, we ate at the nearby Mexican which was again quite decent. The breakfast in the hotel was not bad, with hot options as well as the usual array of pastries and fruit. Good coffee was available throughout the day in the breakfast room, in which we could always find a family-sized table to eat at. This room also contained the only computer with printer for boarding card printing etc. We had two minor problems with the Inn: the first was the lack of a warning on the TV games console about the price - my kids thought it was free but we were charged $7 an hour for this. There is some small print on the opening screen but nothing that kids would notice, so be warned about this if your kids have a separate room. The other problem was locating the entrances to the Inn - several times we shot past and had to detour a bit to find a place to U-turn. Ok, so this was my incompetence as a navigator but a couple of signs would have been nice, as the place is set-back behind a gas-station and a Taco Bell. Both Del Mar and the La Jolla Reserve are a couple of minutes drive (or even walk) away, so the location was perfect for us.

However, this Del Mar location was merely average, not a notch above the rest. PROS: Given the close proximity to I-5, the room was surprisingly quiet with double-paned windows - absolutely no noise. It's very close to Sorrento Valley, La Jolla, and a quick hop to Downtown San Diego so the commute is little to none. Surrounding amenities are excellent: Von's grocery store, multiple restaurants (Mexican, Thai, American Contemporary, Sushi, BBQ, and fast food) and gas stations. It is seven (7) minutes to Torrey Pines State Reserve and Beach which is an excellent option for fitness enthusiasts and those just looking to soak up the North County San Diego Beach scene for even just a short while. The breakfast spread was excellent with even more healthy options to boot: oatmeal, skim milk, cereal, and very fresh fruit (apples and bananas). The breakfast area was spacious, clean, and well attended to. They have made a conscientious effort in the area of security. The front is locked down after 10 pm and the underground parking provides vehicle peace of mind. Small steps, but preventative ones. CONS: Scrambled eggs were from a camping package. There is no reason to provide scrambled eggs unless they're fresh. They provided fresh hard boiled, so why substitute the scrambled? It's a shortcut that Hampton Inn typically doesn't take. Every room typically has a refrigerator and microwave and have never had to pay more for a room with those two amenities. Why change what works, especially in the high tech area of North County? The fitness center is small with dated equipment. Upgrades are needed especially for this being in one of the healthiest and fittest communities in San Diego county. The business center is, well, a computer in the breakfast room ... might want to rethink the planning on that one. All in all, the Hampton Inn Del Mar has: an excellent location and nearby amenities.

Don't need a reservation, you can sit at their bar tables. Order kids meals for your kids (great kids menu) and then get yourself an appetizer or small entree. Be sure to order the house dessert, a delicious ice cream chocolate gudge mess, but huge enough for the whole table.

After doing a ton of research on this website, I settled on the Hampton Inn/Del Mar. And I wasn't disappointed. It's darn near perfect if you're going to the races or anything at the fairgrounds. The rooms are not fancy by any means, but they're clean and have everything you need including free wi-fi. One nice feature of Hampton inns is that if you forget something like toothpaste, they'll bring some up to your room. Also the free breakfast is a terrific bonus with eggs, meat (something different each day, ham, sausage, etc.), cereal (hot and cold), pastries, juice, coffee. They also offered ready to go brown bag breakfasts, which included a bottle of water, a muffin, apple and cereal bar. All of which saved me time and money to enjoy the area. I chose Del Mar because i wanted to go to the horse races, but it also turned out to be centrally located for my other adventures, the zoo, animal park, Torrey Pines and the beaches.", "Date": "September 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for bringing dogs\u201d", "Author": "AZhiker", "ReviewID": "UR3831927", "Content": "This is a very dog friendly hotel.
