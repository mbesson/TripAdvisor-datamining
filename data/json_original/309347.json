{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A lovely place to retreat We booked here based on our reviews on Trip Advisor and we weren't disappointed.The hotel arranged a pick up from the airport for us (isn't this welcoming when you arrive in a foreign country) and from this introduction to our leaving, we were always made to feel more than welcome.We stayed at one of the poolside rooms which was extremely spacious. The basin area was separate from the main bathroom which I always think is a great idea. It was clean and always well maintained.What is really sad is that people just aren't going to Bali (the Australian government are warning their countrymen against going - after the bombing (the bombers were executed a couple of weeks before we arrived)). Our hotel was only half full so the restaurant did lack atmosphere. The location of the hotel was perfect for us - on the main tourist road in Sanur (which you never heard) so easy to do shopping and visit restaurants plus close to the beach.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR366766199", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "fredic"}, {"Content": "Not so Tamukami       the superior room", "Date": "Dec 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR675815337", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "abooz"}, {"Content": "Wonderful stay We stayed at the Tamukami for two nights at the end of our trip to Bali. Everything was perfect, from the hospitable welcome drink to the efficiency and friendliness of the staff. We arranged to do a tour with a member of the hotel staff who was friendly, very helpful and knowledgeable. The highlight of our stay was our dinner at Alise's restaurant complete with live music - there was a great family atmosphere and the hotel owners were very attentive and friendly.

I chose Tamukami, Sanur after reading all reviews in Tripadvisor. I thought I better write a review and share my experience.First of all a big thanks to all previous reviewers. I could not have stayed in a better place in Sanur than Tamukami. Its literally a paradise in Sanur. I stayed in a Superior room. The room was extremely big. Bathroom was huge. Pool area looks great. Cleanliness is excellent. Despite being priced competitively, the room has all the facilities you would enjoy in a resort hotel in Nusa Dua.The breakfast in the morning was very good. You get to chose the style of breakfast. Home made bread is served as well. I went for few tours and took the car with driver from the hotel itself. It was really worth it. The driver (Wayang) was a fantastic guy. He could speak average english and was kind enough to suggest the right places to visit. He helped to take a lot of pics too.Over and all, Tamukami made my stay in Bali a memorable one. I am sure I would chose no other place other than Tamukami when I go back to Bali.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR240762121", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "v_venkie"}, {"Content": "a gem in sanur we stayed for 10 nights from the19th nov.we arrived at night so it was just great to get changed and relax with af ree welcome cocktail.the hotel was like a little tropical paradise.we booked this hotel after reading the other reviews but i must say that i was very surprised at how nice and friendly the staff were.the photos of the hotel do not do it justice it is better when you see it in real life.the rooms were spotless and large,breakfast was great and the pool area was terrific.i must admit that bali was not what i expected but if i was going back this hotel would be fist on my list as it is a wonderful smallish balinese gem.", "Date": "Dec 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR679115136", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "allanhFife"}, {"Content": "Great location at a good price       Terrace", "Date": "Oct 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR900995923", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Happynoodleboy_uk"}, {"Content": "Value for money We booked to stay here after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor. I was a little unsure, but I'm so glad I went ahead and booked. We stayed in one of the suites for $70 per night including breakfast. The room was a great size. It had the biggest bed I have ever seen! It was cleaned every day and was spottless. The staff were very helpful and professional. The restaurant is also great. It was one of the best meals we had in Sanur. The pool and gardens are very pretty, and make for a lovely day lying in the sun. There is plenty of shade for the midday sun! My only dissappointement with Sanur was that it was very quiet. Many of the restaurants were empty, and everywhere seemed to shut around 10.30pm.If you're looking for a nice evening out try Jimbaran bay - the sunset is lovely and there are great restaurants lining the beach all serving freshly caught barbequed fish. Haggle with them on price and make sure you pick a busy restaurant (this makes sure the fish is fresh from that day). Also check out the italian restaurant at the other end of Sanur called Massimo.", "Date": "Oct 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR186810977", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "HStuart"}, {"Content": "What a find! We have been regular travellers to Bali for the past 14 years and have stayed at various hotels but to find the Tamukami was the jewel in the crown. The excellent services and exceptional friendliness was outstanding. We stayed in a bungalow and the size was very comfortable. Each morning after breakfast on our return to the room our room had been cleaned and refreshed. This was always at a very high standard. It is also good to know that the tourists dollar stays in Bali. It is without a doubt a true treasure in Sanur!
