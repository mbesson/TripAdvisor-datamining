First, we were part of a small group of the unlucky ones... we were put into a second building (not the main one where most other guests are staying) which put us further away (just across the way, but still inconvenient) from the main facilities (breakfast, laundry, the main lounge room), and that I am pretty sure that our room was the smallest one in the building. The good: 1) Cheap enough (for Singapore), 2) located right next to the Aljunied MTR station, 3) clean/comfy beds, and 4) good WiFi and internet access. The bad: 1) We had an extremely small and cramped room (if my arms were a bit longer, my arm span could reach from wall to wall). We couldn't open up the door without it slamming into our luggage. 2) I'm not sure about the security of the rooms; twice, when our doors were fully closed and even locked, when others down the hall slammed their doors, our door came open. It didn't really ease my mind about the security when we weren't in the room. 3) You aren't allowed to wear shoes inside. This is pretty grody considering what others may be trudging in (and what I saw others trudging in). You aren't even supposed to wear shoes in the bathrooms. And as I saw others wearing shoes inside, when I wore my designated shower sandals in self-defense, I received some pretty nasty looks from others. 4) There is no elevator, which means that we brought our luggage up three stories into the first building, then down, and then up three more stories into the other building. 5) When you book from Hostels/Hostelworld, there is an additional 10% service charge that you have to pay in addition to the rate quoted to you on Hostelworld. We didn't realize this until we looked closely on the print-out. 5) You get to hear EVERYTHING going on in the rooms next to you. The walls were clearly partitioned off by the owners of the hostel in order to create more rooms, meaning that the huge cracks in the wall (via a shared window between two rooms for example) allow for some serious sound travel. I could almost hear the people next door breathing. 6) Also, in the second building, there are a number of semi-permanent residents who live there; two of them were nicer, but I definitely didn't have that \"welcome to our hostel\" feeling from any of the people who lived/worked there. The ugly: There was literally a pile of steaming, fresh diarrhea to greet us on the first few steps of the staircase into the building... WTH happened there? And an additional freebie of a huge cockroach that presumably died because of the horrific stench of the caca right next to it. It wasn't until about 10 hours after we arrived that someone hosed it off. Also, I didn't learn until the last night of our stay that cockroaches in Singapore can indeed fly. My Singaporean friend had told me this but I had yet to witness it. In the first building, the main hang out room is ACed. In the second building, there is only a fan, and the windows are left open all day/all night long... which also meant that one of the bathrooms was occupied by a huge flying cockroach. I know cockroaches don't bother everyone, but they definitely bother me. My boyfriend and I have been traveling in southeast Asia for about 7 weeks now and this was by far our least favorite place that we stayed in. I know that options in Singapore are extremely limited if you are on a budget (like us), but I would book with caution.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cCheap price\u201d", "Author": "Erik P", "ReviewID": "UR124790420", "Content": "This hostel is very functional for its value. For less than $20US I got a bed in an 8 bed dorm and a hot shower. My only issue is that they make you pay everything up front to secure your place no matter how many nights. Absolutely no refunds. They will not budge. So if you overpay a night and leave early you just will have to eat the cost. Oh and you'll definitely get a nice dose of athletes foot. You cannot wear shoes or sandals anywhere in the hostel. The bathrooms and showers are quite damp and musty.

The location itself was a bit odd. It was not close to town at all really. I felt a bit weird arriving at night into Aljuneid Station (which admitedly it is very close to) and having men, I know they are Singaporean men but still, watch me as I looked for the hostel. Second, it is split across two very separate buildings with no sign on the stairwell for the second one. I nearly went up the wrong stairwell every time I got back there as I was in the second building. It appeared to have a number of female foreign workers living there, which is fine but changed the atmosphere of the place from backpackerish to hall of residenceish in my opinion. The first night I stayed there was a Saturday and there was quite a bit of road noise until quite late too. I mean, I was ok with it. It was not a bad place to stay, the guy who runs it was nice but it is not what I was used to having backpacked in Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the UK. I wouldn't stay there by myself again, especially since it's a bit out of central Singpore, but if I was with my partner or a friend, maybe.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aarhus, Denmark", "Title": "\u201csurely not going to back\u201d", "Author": "silviola86", "ReviewID": "UR115883702", "Content": "I Stayed there 8 nights.
