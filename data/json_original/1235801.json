I heard nothing from the airport - or maybe I just slept like a baby??!! Hotel is fairly new, and has been kept clean. Workout room clean also. Bar area in the hotel is very nice. Maybe 5 min or less to the airport, very convenient. It is NOT hard to find, right off Regan Pkwy on way out of the airport. A BIG thanks to JESSICA at the front desk, she was extremely helpful (I rarely deal much with the staff, but when you must - it is a bonus if they are good). Jessica was just plain awesome. I felt respected and appreciated and not once did I feel like my requests were annoying her (like often in hotels lately). Again - hotel is almost new and the cleanliness overall was great, even in common areas. Plenty of sitting space near lobby for small meetings as well.

The shuttle service from the airport is reliable, parking is plentiful, and if you do end up getting stuck at the hotel, the in-house restaurant is affordable and better than you might expect.

Though this hotel is very well accommodated and clean the quality of it's staff dragged it down. I felt I was an intruder on their daily work lives. The bar attendant served my snack in a to go box and although the place was still open for a few hours proceeded to spray wood polish all around me to clean the bar ... sure, I'm glad they get the dusting done ... but then to keep banging my stool with the broom was pretty darn rude. There were no boundaries at breakfast I learned whose (staff) daughter was doing what and when and was asked 6 times if I was \"doin' alright\" while there was a dirty plate, bowl and cup stacking up and being ignored ... ignored like my wish for a pot of coffee. I chose to use up some Hilton honors points for this stay for two nights and they wanted 60,000 points .... again, that's SIXTY THOUSAND POINTS! I thought I might be staying at the Ritz Carlton on the beach with that installment ... but no ... it was an airport hotel with not one but TWO small bottles of complimentary water! What the heck? BAD idea - should have just stayed at the Holiday Inn Express and got the breakfast for free too. It was however better than the Crowne Plaza Indy Airport hotel I stayed at last month. Greatfully, I didn't have to wait long for the airport shuttle (this hotel IS basically in the middle of a corn field) I was told on the phone \"... that I should have to put my name on the shuttle list\" ... and not \"We're looking forward to seeing you, let me see what I can do for you with regards to the shuttle service .... \" Then the driver showed up in less than 10 minutes and had only one other passenger to pick up. SERIOUSLY!? This is a Hilton chain hotel ... WHERE IS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING???!!! It is not rocket science to teach employees to respect clientele which ultimately earns bigger business and better pay etc etc ... am I confused with another planet people!? On a more positive note, the rooms seem still quite new, they offer beds with changeable firmness. This may seem an odd observation however, they have \"soft closing\" toilet seats! - they don't slam down so your neighbour hears them and consequently your ears don't ring for the next 30 seconds - genious! All of the basic amenities are available in your room - fridge, microwave, free wi-fi, shampoo AND conditioner, weekday USA Today paper, a wonderfully comfy bed, ergonomic chair at desk, plenty of TV channels and the coffee maker. Breakfast is @ $7 to $10 according to hot & cold choices. Reasonably priced according to lack of nutritious options. Being in the middle of no-where there are no lunch options ... some tell lies about a Subway that's within walking distance otherwise they have a \"Pavilion pantry\" offering basic supplies. Overall, a comfortable and clean hotel stay for a brief hotel stay with all necessary commodities and more - MINUS the customer service attention where staff realize that without the customers they'd be working at MacDonalds (for example). I did not hear one single airplane fly over but I knew exactly each time the air conditioning randomly kicked in, even in slumber; gladly I'm one that finds some comfort in that. I guess the air traffic depends on the weather and the runway? * after all is said and done, the gentleman working the front desk mid-morning did raise the bar for other employees.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "mims florida", "Title": "\u201cnothing wrong but no extra aspects to gain higher rating\u201d", "Author": "gwgMimsFlorida", "ReviewID": "UR119074676", "Content": "My recollection of this hotel is like the hotel, bland.

Even with the directions, you get anxious because you can see the hotel from the road but can't seem to get over there. The road continues passed the hotel so far that just when you think you've missed it, there's a very small sign on the right that tells you to turn left. I was driving in the dark and literally this hotel is in the middle of nowhere so it was not easy...maybe it would have been easier in the daylight. But once I got there, I was very pleasantly pleased. It is brand new (that's why the GPS can't find it) and beautifully decorated. There are many comfortable places to sit in the lobby. The rooms are gorgeous with handsome furnishings and marble bathrooms. Beds are very comfortable with crisp sheets and plenty of pillows. They give you complimentary water bottles. And the rooms were very quiet considering how close you are to the airport. My flight didn't leave till 11 so I slept in with no noise issues. There is no complimentary breakfast but their continental and full breakfast gives you so many choices. I ordered the full breakfast for $9.95 where they cook to your specifications. The waitstaff were extremely friendly and attentive. Besides the restaurant, the Hilton Garden Inn also has a snack shop where you can buy things like microwave pizza. But it's a good thing they have the restaurant because literally they built this hotel in the middle of a field. There is nothing but another hotel on the road. You take exit 68 to get to the hotel but the nearest gas stations, restaurants and stores are on exit 66. If you have a rental car be sure to fill up before going to the hotel because getting to the airport from the hotel is a short drive with nothing on it. I think in time they will build more stuff here but right now there's nothing. But that's not going to stop me from coming back. I felt this was a \"find\" for an airport hotel and will return.
