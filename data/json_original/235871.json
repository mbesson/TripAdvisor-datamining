There are many nice looking hotels in Venice and it's easy to become inundated with options. We chose this one because it seemed decent for the price and was in a good location. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here. The hotel is set in a former palace and many of its features are quite old fashioned. This adds to its charm in my opinion. I disagree with previous reviewers claiming it to be shabby and run down. The grand stone staircase, the dark wooden panelled reception area and the large glass windows & chandeliers of the 2nd floor lounge complete with balcony overlooking the canal all add to the warm, homely feeling you can't help but get from the minute you walk through the door. Ok, modern it isn't but this is Venice after all. The rooms are comfortable and nicely furnished, without being anything to write home about. Perhaps a little on the small side if I was to complain about anything, as was the bathroom, but you don't visit Venice to stay in your room! Breakfast was served in the conservatory with a nice view out onto the garden. Access to the garden was closed off with it being winter but I would imagine this would be very pleasant in summertime. Breakfast itself wasn't the best and probably where the hotel gets marked down for me. Typical continental affair but the choice could have been bigger. We stayed in Rome prior to our trip to Venice and the breakfast there was much better by comparison. The hotel is situated in the quiet Dorsoduro area of Venice and this location is a big plus. It is away from the main tourist hotspots so the local bars and restaurants offer better quality and value for money as the neighbourhood caters mainly for locals. Yet the bustling areas of Piazza San Marco and the Rialto Bridge are only a 15-20 min walk away or a few hops on the waterbus from the Ca Rezzonico stop which is 2 minutes from the hotel. Overall, we enjoyed Venice and the Hotel Pausania immensely. If you want a quaint, cosy hotel in a good location, you can't go far wrong staying here.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, excellent value\u201d", "Author": "banana0411", "ReviewID": "UR125884412", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights. We were on the ground floor in room 150. Arrival: we arrived at the Airport and took the bus to the main bus station in Venice we then walked for about 10 minutes following a map to find the hotel, it was fairly easy to find. You need to have wheely suitcases in Venice as most hotels will require some walking. This one you have a choice to take the water bus or walk direct from the train / bus station. It's very close to academia boat stop. Or Zaterre. For us it made more sence to walk the 10 mins than wait for a boat and walk from the boat stop for 5 mins. The woman who greated us was very friendly and we were made to feel welcome immediately. The hotel courtyard out the front is inviting and very pretty. Room: We were on the ground floor in room 150 we got a great deal on our room price far cheaper than anything else we found in this range on the Center of Venice. Our room was a bit dark and dingy, it was just next to the breakfast room and the courtyard out the back was having building work, so it wasn't a great view. The toilet was small and it was only a half size bath. But the actual room was nice and looks like the pictures. A little small but for what we paid we were happy. It was also handy being on the ground floor as I was pregnant. We did go upstairs and the rooms looked much nicer on the 1st floor and there was a nice sitting area. Breakfast: help yourself to bread, meat, cheese, cereal, juice, croissants, cakes and have the hot chocolate!!!! There was always enough and lots of choice to have something different every day. Very nice. Location: perfect, 15 min walk to st marks, and about 15 mins to realto bridge. The room was quite you can hear the local bells ringing but it didn't wake us. The water bus is 5 mins away. I would recommend a water bus pass we used ours lots and probably saved about \u00c2\u00a3100! There are some nice reasonable priced resterants in the road behind particulary the pizza place, with the Hollywood photos! Staff: were really friendly, and helpful.

You should not opt for this hotel if you are after glamour, hi-tech, shopping, discos, tourist crowds. But if you want a discreet retreat in a location that is not invaded by noisy and ignorant tourists, yet accessible from all sides and at all times - do chose the Pausania. Dorsoduro is real Venice, where in winter you can see grannies in fur coats lugging home their supplies from the nearby fish market or boats selling fresh vegetables, where the waiter in any of the bars close to the hotel will recognize you as you have your morning espresso on your second day. Dorsoduro is definitely not industrial tourism! The hotel may be a little old-fashioned and even slightly dated, the furniture may not be most modern, there is no lift, I doubt if any two rooms are the same (which, after all is to be expected in most of Venice - especially in a hotel whose main building is a 15th century Gothic palazzo), but it is a warm place where one feels welcome. The staff is extremely friendly without being servile. The front desk ladies are classy and helpful. The 1st floor (2nd floor to Americans) sitting area and the small terrace opening onto the canal through carved-stone arches are simply fabulous, as is the very steep and slightly inconvenient but enchanting staircase leading to it. The top-floor room we had was not verry big but it had an alcove with a wardrobe and, more importantly, a second window, both opening onto a pretty little courtyard. Everything was spotlessly clean save for an odd old obstinate stain that would obviously not go away despite all efforts. Breakfast is honest and generous and, although coffee indeed comes from a push button machine (pretty much the standard these days) it is real tasty espresso. Frankly, I do not understand how any reviewer could find anything wrong with breakfast at Pausania (or with almost anything else there, for that matter). Exceptional value for money! We got a really, really good price but it was through a local Venice booking site. Better-known international booking sites were some 20% more expensive.

First off, you must note that this is an old palace with high ceilings, window shutters, no elevator and a crooked staircase. We went in may 2011. Already pretty hot outside, we were a bit bummed to hear that they only start putting on the AC in the rooms as of June/July. The windows don't have screens, so beware of friendly birds and the rooms face a courtyard and another building which is very loud. Every hour, you are awaken by a ringing bell a few buildings away. Since there is no elevator, we were forced to carry our heavy suitcases up an old crooked cement staircase..dangerous At night there is nothing to watch on TV but CNN, which gets boring....HOWEVER! This hotel was very beautiful, charming and felt like an authentic hotel in Venice. The bathrooms were accommodating and clean. The room itself was decent and private. They had a beautiful balcony in the upstairs lobby and a space to sit and read. The hotel offered free internet which was very handy and the breakfast was great as well. The hotel itself was in a pretty good location....away from the crowds and the more touristy places, this hotel was located in a quieter, student district, but was basically in the middle of where we wanted to go. In all, it took about a 20 minutes to walk to the Rialto and another 10 to go to St. Marks....but, it went by fast because you observe all the different shops, restaurants and canals along the way.

First night we were placed in a room so small, I could not even open my suitcase on the floor, and because this was our last stop and we were to be there three nights I had hoped to unpack. Also we had to look at a printed mural of horrible-looking wind gods who appeared to be spitting on us from the ceiling. I complained and the night manager told me he could do nothing, I would have to talk to the day manager. We did get moved to a slightly bigger room, but still no place to unpack. At over $ 400.00 a night, it was a rip-off. When I complained that we should not be charged a superior room rate for these obviously NON-SUPERIOR rooms, I was told that we were actually now in a TRIPLE room which cost even more. If that room was a triple, I guess you could have put the third person in the bathroom, but the tub was so tiny he would have had to stand up all night. The upstairs sitting room had great views, but was constantly used by smokers so we were unable to enjoy it. Also it was the poorest breakfast we had in all of Italy and France. Coffee from a push-button machine, and very little choice of fruit, no eggs or hot stuff...stingy with croissants.

The hotel sits on a quiet canal about four minutes' walk (if that) from the Grand Canal in one direction, and about the same in the other direction to the sea/lagoon front. The great thing about it, aside from the location, is the fact that it's really peaceful. Some squares and areas can get very busy, but you don't find many people venturing down this street. For people going to Venice for the first time, it's really easy to get to from the main Piazza Roma (the big transport hub in the north west). We walked, with two small rucksacks and one wheeled case, and it took about 13 minutes. It's probably only 5 minutes from the Vaporetto stop. Walking from the bus terminus, you have to cross over about 4 or 5 small bridges, but it's no big deal with a case. The hotel itself is not magnificent or designer, but is clean, well fitted out, and lovely if you like your history. The wide stone staircase up to the lounge (overlooking the canal) and then up to bedrooms fees very ancient - a bit like the courtyard of a Moroccan Riad(ish). The Maitre'd, Maria, spoke excellent English and was very helpful. It was no problem to leave our bags in reception when we arrived, and then on the day of departure. The room was fine - a bit gloomy (partly because the shutters are often closed to keep out the heat and sun and it looks over the back), but it was clean and comfortable - double bed (two joined together, but firm), big wardrobe, bedside cabinets, TV, aircon and safe. If you're over 6\" tall, you'll struggle with the tiny bath/shower - but again - it was clean and fairly newly refurbished.

As the hotel stay was a departure from my chosen Venice itinerary, this required a Google search and sundry TripAdvisor advice some days prior to departure. Under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Venice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 400 hotel options presented themselves in ascending (or descending, your choice) order of both popularity and price. Finally I chose one on the basis, of its proximity to the Grande Canal and to my guides to be (more about them in a minute), tucked up a tiny linking waterway boasting a single lonely gondolier and the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most photographed fruit and vegetable stall. One Hotel Pausania. An internet booking of 150 Euros for two nights appeared reasonable on the face of it, at least until I arrived. After a severe scramble up thirty-two drunkenly positioned stairs, an extremely narrow and stuffy room confronted me, boasting one slim and unyielding single bed. Not at all what I had in mind. So down the stairs to open up negotiations with the lady on the desk, who said that there would be no problem about an upgrade, just a matter of a few additional euros. (Funny how a language barrier seems to dissolve away when it comes to matters of money). Well we opened negotiations around 300euros and ended up nearer 200euros after a lot of continental hand-gestures from myself, and this was finally agreed by the aforementioned cashier. Just as Jan Morris says in her great book \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Venice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Venetians are hard and experienced negotiators and you take them on at your peril! All I will say additionally about this particular watering hole, is that after stumbling on and off planes, coaches and river boats with two substantial suitcases, the Hotel Pausania presented you with one final and inescapable obstacle: the wonky step assault- course for the knee-challenged. True, I had been up and down these same thirty-two steep and crooked four hundred year old marble steps twice already, but not with the burden of two large cases. So I politely inquired of the now considerably richer lady behind the desk if there might possibly be someone who might assist with maneuvering my baggage in an upward direction? That is towards my recently negotiated larger room? A slight head movement: No; nyet; nein, a negative whichever way you cut it. So with teeth grinding on an assortment of ageing dental work, I struggled twice more (one journey for each case) up the highly polished and undoubtedly lethal marble risers. Arrival at the top step for the third time felt akin to a successful assault on Annapura. But do check out the accompanying photograph and be warned, and if like me and other ex-hill walkers and long distance runners you have a touch of gyp in the knee, avoid the Pausania at all costs. Even with forewarning, and the invocation of doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice on four continents, the result was still the same on departure three days later when asking for help with the cases: no, nyet, nein!", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hereford", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "nothingcomestomind", "ReviewID": "UR86675022", "Content": "The best thing about the Hotel Pausania is the canal side location within walking distance of all the major sights.

(Tip 1: check out the excellent web site www.europeforvisitors.com/venice) The trip was a present from my wife so we were looking for a pleasant, romantic location to base our 5 day stay in Venice. Hotel Pausania did not let us down. Located in the quiet residential area of Dorsoduro by a canal Hotel Pausania is a real gem. Modern facilities in a \"14th century Venetian palace\" and welcoming staff it is the ideal base to see Venice. A 5 minute walk from Vaperetto ( line N1 )stop Ca Rezzonico on the Grande Canal,connects to all the main places of interest including Piazza San Marco and Rialto Bridge. From Marco Polo airport we caught the Alilaguna ( water bus) to Zattere. This is a pleasant 75 minute ride and cost 12 euro.(Tip 2: if you want to pay by card buy it at the Alilaguna Kiosk) It's about a ten minute walk to the hotel, and was easy to find. Honest! We had a map which they gave us with the Alilaguna tickets and used for the duration of our stay. Some of the negative reviews on Hotel Pausania are way off base. Yes you do get mosquittos. It's Venice, warm climate by the water for heavens sake. ( Tip 3 buy a mosquitto repellent for the room, and spray for yourself) The breakfast is a good start for the day and is served overlooking the garden. The staff are friendly , and on arrival we had a bottle of sparkling wine delivered to our room to celebrate my 60th. The best way to enjoy Venice is just to walk around and just hop on or off the vaporetto (water bus) A 3 day pass was 31 euros, and well worth it.. The nearby Campo (square)Santa Margherita has a market in the early morning and in the evening transforms into a vibrant place frequented by the students. Campo Santo Stefano situated the other side of the Grande Canal via the Ponte D. Accademia is a good place to watch life go by, and a stop off , if your walking to the Piazza San Marco. When we visited in late September there were lots of concerts advertised, many of them in churches. These we highly recommend. Listening to Vivaldi's Four Seasons one evening in a church was a lasting memory. We went to 3 concerts ( one free!)all of them spontaneous. we just happened to be passing the church at the time.

Excellent location for the cruise terminal, we managed to walk it in approx 5-10 mins, trundling 2 large cases & 2 back packs..not bad although we were helped on the final bridge over to the cruise terminal by a very helpful porter. I wouldn't recommend the short walk though unless you are relatively ok with negotiating 2 bridges (incl.bridge by terminal) - I am in my 40's, partner early 50's and we were fine, even though the temperature was well into the 30's. The hotel is easily reached via the number one vaporetto which runs along the Grand Canal & was a short 5 min. walk from our stop Ca' Rezzonico. The number one vaporetto & all the vaporetto's we travelled on during our trip were very busy - think a little bit uncomfortable/squashed when you have luggage with you. The hotel itself was located on a quiet canal just off a small square, complete with a church and a few gondolas. Hotel is a small, quaint & intimate old building with a pretty little open courtyard containing a noticeably wonky ,original stone staircase which we would climb to access our room, The decor was rather tired and the bed a little uncomfortable, but the bathroom was nice & clean so all things considered it was adequate for a 3 star hotel. The breakfast was typical continental and was served in a pleasant room open to a small garden where you could watch the little birds looking for some small crumbs to eat - they were quite entertaining. There is also a wonderful canal boat selling fruit etc just along from the hotel, it's very colourful and apparently the most photographed fruit stall in Venice. Staff were very helpful & quite pleasant. Hotel has real potential if it was given a bit of a refurb., but no real complaints it was in a great location & we had a pleasant stay. A few tips would be to shop around if you want to do a gondola ride - the prices vary quite a bit. We were quoted \u00c2\u00a3120 euros by one guy located by St Marks Square - we then walked approx 50 metres along in front of the Doges Palace & managed to get a prettier gondola and more affable gondolier for 80 euros. The gondolier right by the hotel Pausania quoted 100 euros when asked. Also be a little wary of being asked to sign petitions by people asking you to come sign at a table laid out in our case within the square next to the hotel - be aware that after you have signed they will want a cash donation i.e. minimum 10 euros!!!

This hotel was handy for visiting all areas of venice and was 5-10 minutes from Accademia bridge, Accademia gallery and the Peggy Guggenheim collection. the only issue maybe that for the those who have small children the stone staircase(external) was tilted slightly and was slightly difficult to walk down until you got used to it (my daughter had no problem after 3 days) we would definitely choose this hotel if we were returning to Venice.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cNot to be Recommended!\u201d", "Author": "EMSScotland", "ReviewID": "UR10374955", "Content": "We have just spent 4 nights in the Hotel Pausania. From the photos on the hotel's website, we expected our bedroom (admittedly we booked a 'standard' and not a 'superior' room) to be of a reasonable size, light and attractively decorated and furnished. Instead, it was small, verging on poky, dark and - as another reviewer on this webite has commented - the walls were covered in dirty marks and stains where previous visitors had swatted mosquitos - truly disgusting! We had a choice of leaving the windows and shutters closed, in which case the room quickly became stuffy - and was also rather dark - or opening the windows and letting in the mosquitos - both my partner and I received several bites. The breakfasts were adequate but nothing special; the staff were generally civil until we came to pay the bill when the receptionist quibbled with my partner about drinks from the mini-bar, clearly implying that he was lying about the number of drinks we had consumed. When she found she was wrong, she ungraciously failed to apologise. Add to all this the fact that we paid about \u00c2\u00a3520 for the privilege of staying in this place, and my advice to fellow travellers is - give it a wide berth!

I told the desk about the gasoline and they responded it would be moved, but when we returned from dinner at 10:00 pm, it was still on the stairs and because it was the property of the other apartment, couldn't be moved. We should have left as soon as we saw this place, but had spent 30 minutes dragging our suitcases over the canal bridges and it was for only one night. Don't go here.

This was the first leg of a 2 week stay in Italy for our honeymoon and having read all the bad reviews we were slightly apprehensive as to what we would expect. It started well with the hotel booking us a water taxi a couple of days previously for which we paid for on arrival, when we landed in Venice we phoned the hotel and they were very helpful in telling us the exact direction to get the taxi. When we arrived we checked in with very little fuss and we made our way up to our room (no lift but it is typical of the older buildings in Venice) we specifically requested a room with a view of the canal outside during our correspondence and again we weren't disappointed, the view onto the Rio di San Barnaba was wonderful, the only disappointment was that it didnt have a balcony and that we couldnt enjoy it more by sitting out instead having to lean out of the window, but we quickly got over that as we didnt come to Venice to sit in our hotel room! We were shattered after our flights and a 5.30a.m start so we had a sleep for a couple of hours, very peacful and not too much outside noise, when we woke we unpacked only to discover that we had forgotten our toothpaste, we asked down at reception where we could go out and get some and he told us not to worry and gave us his, very kind. Every day we experienced courtesy from the staff and they were very helpful in giving us directions to various places, they even gave us help on our Italian pronunciation, sheets and towels were changed every day without asking, the rooms are clean and well presented with air conditioning (use this rather than opening the windows - mosquitoes!) The breakfast is very basic, the coffee was weak (but thats only because I like very strong coffee) and there was no fresh fruit which we would have expected, basic but you didnt leave the table feeling hungry. Having read previous reviews, I would however have to agree on a couple of things that people raised, that the hotel is expensive for what you get and that its quite shabby inside, firstly, this is Venice and everythings expensive so we knew exactly what to expect before we left, and secondly, yes it is shabby, but again this is Venice and all the buildings are old and therefore prone to a bit of wear and tear, to us it just added to the character of the place, shabby but very definitely clean throughout. All in all, it is a fabulous hotel with plenty of charm with helpful and friendly staff, dont expect too much from the hotel itself in terms of activity but consider it a clean, fairly central and moderately priced base to explore the very unique city of Venice", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWe had a lovely time here\u201d", "Author": "londontravellers-7", "ReviewID": "UR6737884", "Content": "Having read some negative reviews for Hotel Pausania, we thought we'd write one commending the hotel.

It is such an amazing city and we especially liked the Dorsoduro neighborhood, which is less touristy and full of great restaurants and beautiful churches and museums. The only problem we had with our trip was the Hotel Pausania which is very overpriced for its value, needs attention (rooms can be dark and musty), and most notably, the staff was downright rude and unprofessional. In our experience, Venetians are generally very friendly hosts, but the concierges at this hotel barely said hello and were actually patronizing and rude when we had a misunderstanding about the bill. Also, compared with other hotels in the same price range (where friends were staying) the breakfast is so-so. This really is not a four or even three star hotel in anyway except the expense.

On the morning of our departure when we went downstairs for breakfast we were treated absolutely despicably and extremely rudely by the man who was then on duty. There had been no effort to make sure that there was any breakfast and it was all too much trouble for him. We virtually had to beg for some orange juice which he reluctantly gave to us but acted as if we had made an unreasonable request. There was no bread so we asked for two small yoghurts instead which he dumped on the side with such force that one fell on the floor. We have never received this kind of treatment in any hotel anywhere in the world and we travel a lot.
