It was selceted by a colleague and I will admit it would not have been my first choice. The location is good and I followed the advice of other reviewers and the hotel front desk to avoid the streets that led directly down to Market Street as the area is a little dubious. I noticed other reviewers saying that the hotel service and staff were not friendly. In the 12 days there I did not find this at all. In my dealings with the front desk staff they were always helpful and curtious. If the lobby area was not busy I was usually greeted warmly by the staff on duty. The little extras that I have not found at more expensive hotels in the area were most welcome. I made good use of the free wi-fi and was pleased with the coffee/tea available in the lobby during the morning. As I was there on business, my shcedule did not allow me to take advantage of the hosted wine hour. I'd recomend asking for a room on the east facing side of the hotel on one of the higher floors (rooms 10-16 I think). My room was one of these and on clear days the morning sunshine was very welcome once I had opened the curtains. It was also good to be able to open the room windows as many hotels seem to rely solely on air conditioning. I used the attached bar/restaurant for one breakfast and one evening meal. I thought that there were better options available locally and the food was a little oily for my taste.

The hotel itself was a great place to stay as it was well situated for exploring San Francisco, and had many, many easily accessible transit routes. I was able to take BART in from the airport, and able to take transit to go to the Japanese Tea Garden, Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 33 (for an Alcatraz tour), and transit to and from restaurants at night. The Serrano is within easy walking distance to Union Square, and all the shopping and dining that area has to offer. A quick trip down Taylor (be warned, it doesn't take a long walk to get into the heart of the Tenderloin) took us to our favourite brunch place, Dotties on several mornings. All of the staff was friendly and helpful, however I'd like to mention that the concierge named Stephan was amazing. When asked for walking instructions to the shops on Union Street (not Union Square), he suggested a great route along Polk where we were able to avoid marching up and down hills, and able to stop into a number of great shops along the way. When we complimented him on the excellent route the next morning, he told us it was his wife's favourite wandering route as well. Our room was lovely, and had a great number of electrical outlets. This might seem a strange thing to mention, but as someone who travels with an iphone, ipad, chargable camera batteries, and an ereader - it's amazing how many times I'm at a hotel with no where to charge my electronics without unplugging lamps, tv's or mini fridges! Way to go Serrano! :) The Serrano also placed me on a higher floor - which was much appreciated. A lovely view from the 16th floor. This is my 3rd stay at a Kimpton property, the other two were Ink48 in NYC and the Argonaut, also in SF. Of the 3 Kimptons I've stayed at, I'd rate this hotel as my second favourite after ink48. ink48 edges out the Serrano as the staff at ink48 went out of their way to provide me with a fantastic experience for my birthday last year (complimentary sparkling wine and pastries sent to my room, many suggestions of places to go celebrate, front desk recognizing me each time I came past, etc.); it was also my birthday when I stayed at the Serrano, and no special fuss was made for me. I guess this is the difference between a New York hotel, and one just about anywhere else in the world! :) That being said, this certainly is a place I'd stay again the next time I head to San Francisco! The Argonaut is also fantastic, but as it's right on the Wharf, it is a little more difficult to manage as a base to explore the city.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Champaign, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cHaving a Birthday?\u201d", "Author": "R_V_travel_11", "ReviewID": "UR128681270", "Content": "I am not sure what problems recent reviewers experienced but on a second trip here this year and also as a regular returning visitor, I do not see any noticeable changes in quality or staff attitude.

When I first visited a few years ago, the property was immaculate and had great service. The desk and bell/valet staff was great. I don't know what happened in those three years, but Kimpton just seems to have written off the property and the service levels. The most helpful person of all was the doorman/bellman on the second shift. He was sharp, helpful with assistance and directions and overall a great person. The same cannot be said of the desk staff, who seemed overall uninterested in doing anything more than standing behind the desk acting like they were sedated. It took me several calls and I finally had to physically come down to take care of two problems in my room that the desk staff didn't even acknowledge until the valet reminded them to call someone. Sorry, but the Serrano is just not that large or busy enough of a hotel to have such a complete lack of attention to guest needs. The hotel itself needs a refresh, and the room was small, dingy and quite noisy. The room itself was only slightly larger than the bed, and it felt like I was staying in a pop-up trailer most of the time. The hotel is in a dodgy area at the edge of the Tenderloin, so you could not go out at night unless you were in a group. Overall, the experience was definitely not worth the money. The only reason I gave the hotel three stars was due to the great second shift valet.

The restaurant went from Asian Fusion to a pub, unimpressed with the food when I stayed in Jan when they first opened, but haven't tried since so can't really comment. The hotel is small, rooms are tight, and parking is expensive- all typical for Union Square. A few of the front desk and bell/ valet staff are great, a few are mediocre. The wine reception was unimpressive (as compared to other Kimptons), very generic wine- go there on work trips and never make it back in time for wine anyway. No coffee maker in either of our rooms, but great coffee in the lobby so it is a good excuse to go down and mingle. I had an issue on this last trip which will switch me to another hotel for my next SFO biz trip. We stayed at the Serrano on April 9th, I had two rooms (one of them a suite) and was given 2 x mini bar vouchers to use during our family stay. The woman checking me out would not let me use both vouchers- she insisted it was 'one voucher per stay'. I explained a few times, that my wife was in one room, I was in another (with kids in each), we had two stays (2 rooms x 3 nights) and I was given both vouchers (one for each room) on check in. She was adamant that I could only use one (despite being giving one for each room on check in). Very annoying.

Good quality toiletries and lots of pressure in the shower. My rate included breakfast which was a simple juice, toast and coffee which was about enough (just).

I arrived a little over an hour ago. The room is great overall. I took pictures and will post them as well when I have a chance. I did not expect to be on my computer so quickly and trying to prove what the website said about Kimpton's Best Rate Guaranteed. I spent quite awhile at the check-in counter. First, I was astounded when I was told that the $25 food & beverage part of the offer was related to purchasing a room package. Second, the staff member got on the phone pretty quickly at that point to get someone else involved. That person was more like \"Charlie\" from the old \"Charlie's Angels\"...only a voice on the phone. He never came in person. Yet, the counter person told me that I should never have gotten the lower rate because I didn't book it at the 3rd party website...the website was bid-based like priceline or hotels.com. Then, he said they would allow me to keep the rate that I had already reserved and they would look into it more. I kept telling the guy this was on their own website. Later, I just got a call in my room telling me that \"this one time\", they would honor the rate and the $25 promise from the Kimpton website. I had the website up on my laptop & read it to the guy who had told me \"it was probably in the fine print\". He told me that the unnamed person he talked to has been with the hotel for many years doing reservations and had never heard of the website (venere.com) where I found the rate and the reservations person matched on the phone after verifying it herself. I came here anticipating a very fun and pleasant stay based on other reviews and the website. The management was responding to every review it seemed. That impressed me & I thought that that must mean a very responsive customer-focused place. Right now, I feel like they are still trying to say that I misread the guarantee, it doesn't say what it says, and I have no faith that it will be honored in the future since it was just \"this one time\". --- Sure, the robe is in the closet, the free wireless is there, and there is supposed to be a wine reception right now which I will go check out. But, feeling like I had to fight for something that is promised, and feeling like they think they did me a \"favor\" rather than acknowledging that I was informed & cared enough about giving this hotel my business that I actually read up on it.... I don't know... starting off this conference & vacation sourly. ===================================================== Going to go checkout after doing this.I have read reviews posted today by others yesterday...I wish my experience was same. I like the hotel and the wine reception. The towels are great. The housekeeper did more than was needed usually. Even though I would put towels up to keep, they would be changed. The thermostat was always turned off and the room would be cold when I returned at night. No biggie & easily remedied. 14th floor room - not spectacular view if looking for \"sites\"; but it was a nice view to wake up to. Some street sound is to be expected...nothing that interfered with sleep or anything like that. I thought back to check-in and how that went. The front desk guy acted like he did not know about playing a game to get something free or to make a charity donation if I lost. I had to explain it...then he said \"Oh oh yeah\". He would only do blackjack and then didn't know where the cards were which were right by his keyboard. When I lost, he didn't know about the SPCA or what the money was for or went to. Frankly, I wonder if he kept it. That is not the way I want to feel about a staff. The weather provided on the TV never worked. The Best Rate Guarantee...the restaurant didn't know what I was talking about. I added a day as I had expected. The key was extended by the front desk. However, when I got back to my room that night, it didn't work. When asking for a map at the concierge, they did not have any to provide. The guy said he would get one to me, and never did. The account summary on the TV worked the second day; but has not worked every other time I have tried including today. I am quite concerned that the rate for the extra day will not be what I was told it would be. I expect there will be issues with the $25 food/bev credit for the guarantee. This has been pretty unsettling when I think about these things and just want it all to be smooth. The location, cleanliness, noise, and all that were just fine. It is just a disappointing thing that I spent nearly double what some other colleagues have spent at nearby hotels and they felt things were much easier and smoother. So... really think about what you NEED to feel comfortable and good. If peace of mind with where you stay and no struggles are it...this is NOT going to be the hotel for you.

Cons: I called in advance to request a feather free room. When I arrived, I confirmed it and the front desk representative read me the notation on my account and confirmed that my room would be feather-free. It was 100% not feather-free. I would have preferred an honest 'I don't know\" or \"I don't think so - let me check\" rather than getting up there and getting all itchy and sneezy because of the down. They sent up someone to switch out the pillows and the blanket, but still detracted from the overall experience.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livermore, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel and Awesome Location\u201d", "Author": "damien d", "ReviewID": "UR126164127", "Content": "I stayed at the Serrano hotel this past weekend and I must say the service and accomodation was great.

Regarding food, never had in Serrano's restaurant but there are plenty of restaurants catering to all variety of people around Serrano. You will get almost all the cuisines around Serrano. That is not a problem at all. Regarding the staff, they are OK. They could do a better job, be more friendly. That doesn't mean they have done a bad job, they are there for whatever you want, but they could be a bit more friendly. The rooms are medium sized with flat screen televisions. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom is adequate. If you have 3 to 4 big suitcases, it might be a bit cramped but majority of the rooms in San Francisco are of this size.

The lobby is attractive, and features free tea/coffee and free wine for one hour each evening. If you join the hotel's rewards programme, you get free easy-to-connect wifi throughout the hotel. We also got complementary continental breakfast vouchers, valid at the adjoining restaurant - and the food was pretty good. However, my room was tiny, barely larger than the queen-sized bed. There was no desk, which is a serious omission for your average business traveller, and very little floor space to spread luggage around. My colleague, who paid the same rate, did get a desk and more space - so presumably you can demand something bigger if you don't mind making a fuss. Another annoying feature was the glowing light switches. Presumably they are lit to help you find them in the dark, but in my opinion they are far too bright. Given the tiny dimensions of the room, it was like being surrounded by a row of candles all night. Another couple of things: the television was at the side of the bed, making it difficult to view from the bed; and there was a surprisingly large gap between the toilet and the toilet roll dispenser (fortunately I'm quite tall!).

Let me start at the end...and that was getting a call from my out of country family member (visiting from Montreal) that she had bites all over her legs. Uh oh....here we go. We've never experienced bed bugs. We quickly packed (it was a quick overnight trip) and went downstairs to check out and inform front of house that they had issues with bed bugs. What we experienced at that point was disbelief and utter rudeness. My cousin tried to show the staff member who checked us out (Pam Davis) her bites, but she would have none of it and quickly dismissed our complaints in an extremely rude manner. In the meantime, my 3 year old daughter has bites, as does my mom. All in all, there were 5 of us in two rooms, and eveyone has bites on their legs! The manager (Jana Syquia) was at least cordial, but she was indifferent to our plight and her only comment was to fill out a report. Ridiculous! Clearly, the staff at the Serrano do not care about their customers because by not taking us seriously and just looking at our legs for themselves, they are going to continue renting bed bug infested rooms 503 and 507 (and who knows how many other rooms) to unsuspecting travelers with bed bugs.

I arrived earlier than standard check-in time and was prepared to leave my bag and so some sightseeing if they could not accommodate me. The clerk at the front desk made a big deal about how I was early, and then gave me a room. I did not need the scolding and it certainly did not serve any purpose other than to give me a poor welcome to the hotel. Even the bellman, who during my stay always had a smile and a greeting, commented on it when he saw me come down from my room a bit later. The hotel is located just outside an area in San Francisco that provides a great deal of social services to high need people, several of whom were lying on the sidewalk. The quickest route to Market St. and the BART and MUNI is through a few blocks that I would not feel comfortable walking down at night. I was concerned that this area might flow up toward the hotel; it did not. And the bellman suggested walking down O'Farrell St, and not Taylor St, to get to Market St., and this felt safer. I do want to make it clear that the hotel is outside of this area and I was not concerned for my safety there. The hotel is covered in scaffolding; they are finishing some extensive renovations with some exterior cleaning. I knew about this when I made the reservation and did not notice it during my stay. I had no trouble finding the hotel. The lobby is large, lush, and to my taste not lighted enough, especially when coming in from the outside on a bright day. But it is something to see and gives the place an old elegance. There are two small elevators to bring you to the rooms (more old elegance). I was given a small room that was quiet and comfortable. The door opened into a small hallway that led right to the bed; the bed was the closest thing to the door. The desk was next, with a small love seat in front of the window. I did not have trouble finding electrical cords and I did spend a bunch of time playing with a puzzle they left in the room (very cool)! Nice television set up with plenty of channels to view, plenty of drawers and closet space to unpack into, and really good internet was available in the room. A very large bathtub/shower filled about 2/3rds of the bathroom. One downside: the toilet was so close to the wall that I did not fit on it comfortably, and I am a regular size person. I loved the soaps and toiletries provided. Really nice stuff. The hotel does not have coffee makers in the rooms but does provide a morning coffee service in the lobby. With the exception of the one clerk who was not having a good week when during my stay, the staff were friendly and helpful. Really excellent. They quickly recognized me as a guest and welcomed me back more than once. This suggested to me that the one clerk was an anomaly. Sadly, the unpleasant woman who checked me in is my last memory of the hotel. I asked her if she could tell me what the total cost was, and she said \"you'll be signing a copy of the bill and the number will be on it\". Wow. Overall, the stay itself was nice and the hotel offers some cool experiences, is quiet, and for me, was very affordable.

I had a corner room, which had nice windows, and nice decor. I went to the bar for the wine hour and they have great, inexpensive \"bite\" food.

We had a corner room with barely enough room to walk around the bed let alone lay your suitcase out. Also, itt was suppose to have a city view, our city view was billboard of a guy smiling right at us. The elevators are really difficult during heavy traffic times because of their size and people trying to fit their luggage. The darkness of a the hotel gives it a bit of a run down feeling.

I think in these circumstances such requests are justified and should be guaranteed. However to the credit of the receptionist she did jiggle some of the rooms and eventually we had rooms that were only three doors apart which was not too bad.

The bathroom was large and clean, water pressure was excellent, the bed comfortable, and housekeeping first class. There was some sort of remodeling or repair work being done on the outside of the hotel building, and workers were up on scaffolds using noisy power tools, but this occurred only during the day, when we were either out of the room or didn't mind. I used the small fitness center in the basement which, for a hotel, was actually very good. The equipment was in good working condition, my only complaint is that someone set the air conditioning to maximum and the gym was absolutely freezing. Tried to find an adjustment but couldn't see it. That wasn't a huge deal. The evening wine/social hour was fabulous -- excellent wines and my wife and I had a good time socializing with some of the other guests. I do wish the hotel was in a better neighborhood, but there's nothing to be done about that.

The bathroom was also quite small, and made me glad that I was traveling alone. The workspace was a bit cramped, but was ok. Overall, I liked the room. My only complaint is that the windows were FILTHY. There was a nice view, but I really could not see it through the grit, which was certainly disappointing. I enjoyed the free coffee in the mornings (though beware coffee drinkers - the to-go cups are quite small so you will certainly need another cup in the morning), as well as the wine reception at night. I used the fitness room each day, and thought it was fine. It was a little small, and with only 4 cardio machines, it got a little crowded in the morning. There also seemed to be no a/c or ventilation, so it got quite hot! Luckily, the Serrano provides towels and water for those who work out. I also used the business center to print my boarding pass on the day I checked out. I had to pay to use the internet on the computers (big, beautiful iMacs that have Windows and Leopard!) and print the page. I found this disappointing as the wireless internet in my roo was free during my stay as I am an inTouch member. I felt nickel and dimed as this service is normally free of charge at other hotels.

Checked in at 10pm wasn't a problem, had only two rooms left to choose from -- one on second floor, or one on 7th floor by the elevator. We took our chances and chose the latter one. Surprisingly enough, you could barely hear the elevator doors opening/shutting. The hotel is located about 3 big blocks away from Union Square, not too bad of a walk. The room is very well decorated. King-size bed with soft sheets, Aveda toiletries, nice color theme throughout the room. Our view was the top of another building though. I asked to borrow an electric converter for my laptop one night, the housekeeper brought me a comforter. Hmm. After clarifying what I needed, he told me to ask the front desk the next morning. Not sure why he couldn't just tell the front desk himself. The next morning I went down and asked the front desk, without hesitation he said no, \"we don't have it.\" So I asked again, specified again the type of converter I needed, he looked in a drawer and found one. When handing it to me he said \"Be very careful with this, we only have one here.\". Again, not really something I needed to hear. We had an early flight out, so we checked out around 6:30 in the morning. The guy at the front desk seemed to be still half a sleep, we couldn't get any smiles or facial expressions out of him. The bellman came and asked if we needed a taxi to the airport, we politely declined and said we're going to take the BART. After walking 7 blocks with our two luggages, we saw that BART doesn't start until 8:30am on Sundays, but our flight leaves before 9am. Had no choice so we took the cab, paid almost 40 bucks for the ride. The entire time in the cab we were trying to think of reasons why both the front desk guy and bellman failed to inform us BART's operating time, knowing that we were heading there. I frequently stayed at Kimpton Hotels, never had I encountered this kind of indifferent service. I hope the manager of Serrano Hotel is reading this because I'd still an answer for the sub-standard service we received. As for other people who are considering staying here, don't.

Our stay in the Serrano Hotel was ok but not great because of a couple of things. First the pros: I was a little worried about the location after reading some of the earlier reviews but we felt extremely safe around the hotel area. The room was small but I could understand it, this being San Francisco. Good eateries (True Blue cafe, Nan n Curry), BART and the tram lines are very conveniently located. The wine social at 5 pm was great and so was the easy check-in and check-out. The door man welcomed us back each time we came back to the hotel. Cons: For some reason, the AC in the room was not great. It felt like it wasn't working well. We woke up a couple of times in the night to reduce the temperature further to get it to work again. Our worse experience was with the concierge. The concierge (Stephen per his name tag) was not helpful and was very rude. The morning we started from the hotel to the airport (Friday morning 5/8), we went by the concierge's desk and asked Stephan to book us a shuttle to the airport. He asked my name to note it down and for some strange reason, doesnt like my last name, saying that it was too confusing for him (even though I was spelling it for him)!! So he strikes my name out and asks for a - I am quoting him here - 'simple name like Smith'. We thought this was extremely rude and insulting considering that international customers visit this hotel and they have last names other than 'Smith' but we didn't want to make a big fuss out of it and were eager to get going. My girlfriend gives him her last name and he tells us that the noon shuttle will be at 12:35 pm. We thought that this was because of the shuttle running late and so when we were at the check-out around noon, we were surpised to see another hotel employee (a tall guy with a hat) come by and tell us that we missed our shuttle. So my girl friend and I tell him that we were told that the shuttle was at 12:35 and not at noon. When the concierge is approached, he says that he told us that it was noon and that the 12:35 time was when the shuttle would reach the airport. I could understand that there was a miscommunication and all it would have taken for them to right the situation is to make alternate arrangements (like booking us on the next shuttle). But the focus of Stephen was more on making sure that he shows us that he was correct and the two of us heard it wrong. He sends the other guy into some room, to make alternate arrangements we thought, but he comes out with the paper that the concierge had filled out to show us that he had noted the time for the shuttle ride as noon. So instead of helping us find alternate transportation, Stephen is engaged in proving us wrong! Finally we ask him to make alternate arrangements and the concierge starts calling other shuttles and tells us that they had another shuttle between 12:45 and 1 pm. We declined and told him to get us a cab. However the second gentleman comes along and gets us into a private taxi service and tells the taxi driver to charge us the same $15 per person rate. The taxi guy was very courteous and went above and beyond what was expected of him. The attitude and, may I say, lack of professionalism shown by the concierge Stephen(who has communication issues for sure and is a grumpy person with no smile on his face at anytime we saw him) left a sour taste in the mouth. This hotel prides itself on exceptional service and so it is indeed very disconcerting and insulting when you find unhelpful staff like this.

The homeless issue is a well known problem in all major cities, I prefer to be reminded of this problem, rather than believing that we live in a society where all are equal.

The 2 double bed room was fair in size and the beds & bedding were quite comfy and clean! The bathroom was large enough to comfortably move around, shower and have space for your clothes & supplies. The room also came with 2 bathrobes for guests to use which was a nice touch. We enjoyed the tea service each morning but were never around to enjoy the wine reception in the afternoon. As for the location, I thought it was pretty center to alot of shopping, transportation and restaurants. I knew in advance, from previous trips to SF, that parking would be pricey so we did not even bother to rent a car and instead rode the BART from the airport to the Powell St. Station to get to the Serrano...which was roughly 4 blocks away. I also investigated in advance the SF MUNI system so we each purchased a 3-day MUNI pass for $18 to ride as many bus & cable cars we wanted/needed to during our stay. The MUNI pass was awesome because we didn't have to worry about having exact change to ride each time, we just showed the driver our passes, and in reality with all of the public transportation we used we ended up using about $27 in transportation fees had we used cash instead of the pass. What made the pass even handier was the MUNI kiosk that sells the 3-day Muni passes was just outside the Powell St. BART station, so we purchased our passes even before we initially walked to the Serrano. If there was one downside at the Serrano it was that we couldn't print off our boarding passes because the single business center computer was not working properly; the day we left we had to ask the concierge to print off our passes for us, which he did without issue. If there were but one issue I had with the hotel was that if you actually wanted to use the business center computer for anything other than to print boarding passes it was that it cost you $5.95 for 15 minutes of internet use and 49 cents per page printed. I thought that cost was a bit excessive for guest use. We also enjoyed the Ponzu restaurant. We ate there during happy hour & enjoyed some happy hour food specials and had a beverage or 2.

The following day we moved into the ACT theater suite which was awesome and unique(the only one in the building) I felt extremely fortunate that Mr.Lukinov was so generous on this stay, I can not thank him enough, and was lucky enough to do it at wine hour, as I asked the young man serving the wine if he could tell me Mr.Lukinov's work hours, only to find out I was asking the man himself, and he knew exactly who I was. Stefan at the concierge was very helpful and after getting our bags to our room upon check in, he asked for our names and throughout the stay referred to me as Mr.Omar.

Lots of sushi and Indian eateries nearby. Didn't try them, maybe next trip. A few things I think could be improved. Although they offer coffee in lobby, would like a small pot in room, just to get you off the dime while you're waking up. They need a brand of soap that lasts longer.

This hotel is on fringe of Tenderloin district but just use common sense and you should be fine. It's also extremely close to one of the main cable car stations, Union Square, shopping, food, the Westfield Mall (love the food court there). And no big hills to negotiate.

The hotel itself was very nice, of course, cozy and elegant. For future SF getaways, we would stay here versus our usual hotels. Location was great, two blocks from Union Square.

I'm partially glad we did this but also wish we had our complete stay at this excellent hotel. We stayed at The Fairmont and upgraded to a Tower Signature Suite, we had a King Executive Room at the Hotel Rex and an upgraded room at Serrano. By far, we enjoyed the Serrano the most. Mr. Antonio Flores and the rest of the excellent staff made our stay much nicer with his personalized service. Our arrival was early, nonetheless, our room was thankfully available. All requested amenities were honored, such as an upper floor with a view, feather pillows, etc. Mr. Flores made sure that there was a personalized welcome item, based on a discussion I'd had with him via email. Nobody else givers that level of service! The hotel is on the cusp of the Tenderloin district but we had no issues and quickly learned to avoid walking in that direction. I felt completely safe in the immediate area around and within the hotel and in the direction of Union Square. The hotel is an easy walk to excellent shopping and transportation (giving easy access to the entire city). I was a bit surprised at the relative paucity of fine dining in the entire area, but this is no reflection on the hotel (and maybe I just didn't wander to the right spots). Our room was large and the bathroom, with jacuzzi, had the best shower of all three hotels. I believe that this was the hotel that had Aveeda bath products, my personal favorite. Our room was clean, had free Internet access, and well lit. Emergency routes were well-marked. The only fault I could come up with is that it's impossible to get to the bathroom if the sofa bed is extended. But, being part acrobat, I was able to get there without waking my family. The concierge was most helpful in arranging a last minute tour for us and ensured that it all went smoothly. He had great suggestions. I really can't say too may good things about this facility and, even without considering the most reasonable room rate, Serrano beat out its competitors...hands down, including the upgraded Fairmont room.

The Serrano Hotel in San Francisco was a disappointment. The location is fantastic in \"the most walkable city in America\". We were able to get to all modes of transportation easily, great shopping was nearby, and great restaurants were convenient. But the hotel is not run like a typical Kimpton. Be prepared...because it is in downtown, the spaces in the hotel feel squeezed. The rooms are small. I stayed in a \"double-double\" with my husband, two kids, and a dog, luckily for just one night. Afterwards, I stayed in a queen room, corner of the building, and the room felt perfect for one person. Kimpton is supposed to be pet friendly. Though my dog was allowed, no special attention was given, as occurs at other Kimptons. Also, next time I go to San Fran with a pet, I need to choose a place that has some grass/plants around so he can do his business! Except for the doormen, all the staff assisted us with a smile. However, they had odd policies. Kimpton places a placard in the bathrooms to let you know what they can provide in case you forgot something. But when my friend mentioned she needed a toothbrush (something the placard says the hotel will provide free), she was told to get one from the honor bar! At $3.00. The hotel provides room service, but don't plan on using it early in the morning on the weekend. We had an 8 am bus to catch, and room service was not available until 8 oclock that morning. Unfortunately, I hadn't seen the fine print on the order form and was counting on a 7 am meal from the hotel. I had to give my money to the Starbucks in the hotel across the street instead.

Only downside was when we called the front desk to ask for some toothbrushes/toothpaste (yup, we are the travelers that forgot) and after waiting in our rooms for half an hour, finally went downstairs to get it. Apparently the front desk person forgot to send it up - he did apologize, and then informed us he only had toothbrushes, no paste. We were told we could walk down to the corner market and pick up some. This wasn't a big deal, but since the room has signs that clearly state a list of complementary items they had available for us forgetful travelers (and toothpaste was one of them), I thought it was a bit discouraging.

I saw the rates for $104.88 per night on travelocity, so I decided to book via the hotel website itself incase i wanted to cancel for a better rate if available at the Westin. When I called in to request for a rate, they gave me $140+. I then asked why it was so high compared to what I saw on travelocity, and they put me on hold for a quick minute and then responded with \"we will match that\". I think that alone is very decieving as they were able to knock off $40 per night for us within 1 min. Second - although you see all the reviews of this location being in a convenient spot, at night, this street is pretty quiet and so is the intersection where the Hilton is located. There also seems to be more homeless people loitering around this area compared to others. Third - This hotel will charge you $50 (believe this is some insurance charge) each night you stay on top of the room rate. This will be deducted from your form of payment and supposedly will be returned back to your account. Either right after check out or 48 hours after check out. Which is fine if they actually return the money back to you. Fourth - When my boyfriend and I checked in, the person at the front desk gave us two key cards that did not even work for our hotel room PLUS charged us TWICE for our stay and didn't even acknowledge what he did. My boyfriend didn't know either until he looked at his online statement - thankfully for that. When we notified the front desk of this situation, all they did was apologize and contacted their accounting dept who unfortunately told us they couldn't even do anything. So I stepped in and asked, if you are going to return our $50 insurance charge per night upon our check out, why can't you return the second charge as this is not a valid charge? They could not even give me an answer nor did they try to resolve it. So finally, the next front desk person we spoke with said she will try the accounting dept. again and give us a call the following business day, Monday (we left on a friday). At this point - it is now Thursday, no refund was made nor did they even bother contacting us. I believe they are waiting and expecting us to dispute the charge from the bank which is completely insane and the transaction and investigation for the dispute will take weeks compared to just a refund from the hotel itself - we have already notified them of this delay and nothing has been done. This amount was a lot too and he had used his debit card. Fifth - They give you keys for the bar which is located in the tv shelf. They tell you the keys are for the bar and make it sound like anything from the bar is complimentary. I first thought the drinks/snacks were complimentary but they don't mention you have to pay for everything until you ask - nor do they leave a sign anywhere about it compared the other hotels I've stayed at. Conclusion - Hotel was really small, pictures of the hotel gave a much bigger and nicer impression of the hotel until we walked in it. The next time I visit, I think I will stay at the Westin and pay 50 dollars more for just the convenience, safety, security, bigger room and a staff who can provide even an ounce of satisfaction to their guests.

When you depart the hotel everything that is of interest is to the right, up the hill toward Union Square approx. 3 blocks. The hotel sits right on the corner of Taylor Street and Powell, so it is in close proximity of the Mission/Powell trolley embarkation spot.

All related hotels host evening wine/beer hours in the lobby, which is a very nice perk. Check-in was unbelievably smooth. I had been staying at another Kimpton (Hotel Triton) earlier in the week and checked out at noon before walking the 1/3 mile to the Serrano. I fully expected to not be able to check in, but I had hoped to at least leave my luggage before heading out again. Much to my surprise, I was greeted warmly and given my preferred room immediately. My room was on the 12th floor and had a so-so view east of Union Square. My room was wonderful--decadently comfortable queen sized bed, sufficent armoire and tv, and decent bathroom with bath/shower combo and Aveda products. The rooms aren't large, but you are hard-pressed to find large rooms in the middle of San Francisco. The room was spotless and was immaculately tended to each morning by housekeeping. I'm a member of the loyalty program with Kimpton, which includes a \"gift\" upon each arrival. When I arrived to my room, I found a 16 oz. bottle of spring water and a small box of Napa-produced truffles. Very nice touch. The concierge assisted me twice--once to arrange shuttle transportation to the airport and another time to make reservations for my party at a nearby restaurant. Each time, Chad was most gracious and helpful. My only complaint was with room-service from the adjacent restaurant (Ponzu). On my last morning there, I ordered breakfast and was told delivery would take place within 30 minutes. After 55 minutes, I called to inquire about the order since my shuttle was due to pick me up in 45 minutes. I was told that the kitchen was backed up and my order would not be ready for at least another 25 minutes. I emphasized that I had been conveyed different information when I placed the order and that I would need to cancel the order due to my shuttle. Within 5 minutes, I had a knock at the door and my breakfast was ushered into the room. The restaurant manager had delivered it and then told me it was on the house. In spite of the frustration of waiting, I felt it had been handled very well. One final note: many reviewers have commented/complained about the large number of transients in the area. San Francisco is a large city and the Serrano Hotel is located in the middle of it all. Unfortunately, homelessness is a very sad reality of city life in the United States. I did not encounter one hostile transient during my entire stay. I felt completely safe and comfortable (and spent much of my time alone). Homelessness makes much of us uncomfortable--and it should. But it is not a threatening issue that should dissuade visitors from staying in the Union Square area.

The room was cute. It was in a good location and I would stay here again (if I can get it for $80 on Priceline, but I would never pay $200 for the room that we got). Okay, so the hotel's website is pretty misleading. Let's just say that the hotel hired an excellent photographer. The lobby and rooms look many times larger than the actual size. We just decided to pretend that our room was a bedroom, not an actual hotel room and it felt a little better. There was just enough space to walk around the bed and that was it. That said, the room was cute, very cozy and comfortable. Things weren't quite as nice as the pictures - the bedskirt was pretty rumpled and the windows were pretty dirty - but it wasn't horribly objectionable, just not what I had been expecting. Service wise, it was mixed. We arrived early, around 11 a.m., and we were able to check in at arrival and were given a room on the top (17th) floor. Yay! However, strangely, later in the day when we were returning from shopping we saw some sort of employee exiting our room. Seemed kind of wierd considering we were already checked in and it wasn't really time to start cleaning the room. We called and then went to the front desk to try to figure out what was going on. They kind of blew us off, but eventually decided that it was somebody checking the minbar. Hmm...that's the first time, I've seen that, but whatever. Also, unlike other reviewers, nobody happily greeted us upon entrance and exit. Not a big deal, but I think we were expecting a bit more of a pampering atmosphere, and it was more like self serve. In regards to location, it was conveniently located close to shopping and the BART and MUNI. That was very nice and worth quite a bit. As others have said there is a major homeless problem in the area. Normally, I can just ignore them and keep walking but this past trip was a different experience entirely. I was followed, called a [--] and had objects thrown at me. Not entirely pleasant, but I just tried to brush it off. Afterall, it makes a good story. And a side note, in regards to the oft mentioned Dottie's Tru Blue Cafe, which is about a block from the hotel. So NOT worth it. We waited in line for about an hour and a half for breakfast. The experience was interesting I guess...I mean how often do you get to watch crack heads pacing back and forth in front of you or see a drug deal on the corner?

The beds are comfortable and the staff is friendly. It is certainly adequate. It is just far from luxurious. If you are from Europe, you will be very satisfied with the room sizes. If you are used to U.S. hotel room sizes, you will be extremely disappointed. The bathroom was so small, I kept bumping my head and other body parts just turning around in it.

They actually had quite a few channels. This has been a somewhat rambling review. The bottom line is that at the regular price, this is not the hotel for you.

Well, we were not disappointed! Serrano is a 4 star hotel amenities wise, but a 5-star in terms of service, overall quality of the facility, cleanliness, location, etc. Highly recommended! Some specific points people might find useful: - Parking if you have a hybrid is free (COOL!) Otherwise, parking is VERY expensive at and around the hotel. Better to take transit or a shuttle to the hotel and rent a car by the day. Car rentals are within 1 block of the Serrano. Cheapest way to Serrano from SFO is to take the BART from the airport right to the Powell station. From there it is a 5 minute walk to the hotel. $5.15 one way per person and 30 minutes. Easy. - Serrano is part of the Kimpton managed chain. It is owned by someone else, but Kimpton does a superlative job managing it. - the hotel is located just 3 small blocks from Union Square, so is very central to the good stuff of downtown, the cable cars, nob hill, shopping, Chinatown, etc. The hotel is central to all the walking areas. I love to walk so this was important. - from 5-6pm the hotel hosts a complimentary wine hour in the lobby, which is very nice. - the rooms are spotless, well maintained, up to date, and quiet. - we booked a King deluxe and when we got there, we negotiatted at the same price for a queen for 2 nights and a suite for 2 nights. Both were excellent. The suite had a 2 person jacuzzi. Both rooms had views of the city from the 11th and 10th floors respectively. - the theme of this Kimpton hotel is \"games\" (literally) and they have a range to borrow. We saw only a young family buying into the theme and we did, but it is a nice touch that separates the Serrano from the competition and makes it more personal and fun. - the business center has big screen computers and free internet access. Free internet comes with every room too. The fitness room is bright and clean, but small. There is a dry sauna. Nothing special in this area, but people were using it.

We've stayed here for the past three nights during our first trip to San Francisco, and we've really enjoyed our stay. When we arrived Saturday night in the pouring rain, our cab was promptly greeted by a doorman with a huge umbrella and a luggage cart. Check in was smooth, and the front desk clerk could not have been nicer giving us maps and a layout of the city. I will admit that the location of this property is on the edge of a bad neighborhood, but the front desk is helpful in telling you where NOT to go to avoid the worst part. Our room is small, but I expected that, so I wasn't disappointed. The bed is super comfortable: fluffy, clean, white comforter and fluffy pillows. The bathroom is marble with a sizeable tub with shower. Water pressure is fabulous. Aveda shampoo, conditioner and lotion is a nice touch. Towels are soft and monogrammed with an \"S\". The one problem with the bathroom is that you can't really sit straight on the toilet since it is so close to the wall.Cheetah bathrobes hanging in the closet and the toys and games they have in the mini bar area are just a fun idea. I goofed off with the etch-a-sketch for a while and my husband is still threatening to \"walk the dog\" with the yoyo. There is a safe and free internet access (wired, not wireless) and the items in the mini bar were not as ridiculously priced as some I've experienced in the past. Really good coffee is available in the lobby from 5am to 10am, and we didn't make it to the wine/beer reception, but they have that daily from 5 to 6. We got in late and ate dinner at the attached restaurant, \"Ponzu\" which was pricey but good with average service. All in all, it's been a really great experience. Every time we come back in, we're greeted with, \"Welcome back!\" and we've been happy to be back.", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "balbacm", "ReviewID": "UR10646241", "Content": "we really enjoyed this hotel. it is quite charming and friendly - great, very helpful staff.

But for an hour and a half of our time it was worth it. The hotel is not in a very savory neighborhood (The Tenderloin for those who know), but it is very close to Union Square and there are lots of hotels around there so it is not likely that you will encounter much trouble. It is in the \"theater district\", and near Nob Hill, SoMa--long story short it is pretty convenient to get just about anywhere in the downtown area and it is near Muni (bus/streetcar) lines that will take you further out towards Golden Gate Park, Haight/Ashbury, etc. This old building has been lovingly transitioned into a perfectly lovely hotel. Nice fixtures and furnishings. Clean. Nice staff.

I had no choice, since it was booked via Priceline the day before. First off the positives in no particular order: IPOD alarm clock, plush bed and linens, tastefully decorated. Lastly in no particular order: Mini frig, even though it's inside the TV armoire, was particularly noisy. The key for the minibar was broken, so I'm not sure an employee or a previous guest ate or drank something. Room was small, even though I seemed to have one of the bigger rooms on the floor, based on the emergency floor plan. My room number was 709 facing O'Farrell. I had a view of the Columbia Hotel (rundown) and a view of the Hilton kitty corner to the Serrano. The bathroom was small. There was no room to place toiletries. I had to use part of the bathtub and the top of the toilet to place toiletries. The toilet location was awkward. You couldn't close the door to use it, if you know what I mean. The shower pressure was excellent. The rooms along O'Farrell don't have enough sound insulation from the road noise below. I can't imagine what it must sound like on the lower floors. Room service selections sparse for a supposed 4-star hotel and you must order between 5-10pm for dinner. The area isn't too bad. Just don't go west or south (Tenderloin). Go north, and you hit Nob Hill. Go east, and you hit Union Square. If you need parking, park across the street at the California Garage for $32 total. It was advertised as $26 with in and out privileges, but there is a 25% tax on parking (RIP OFF). But it's better than paying $44 at the Serrano. What else? The fitness center was well equipped. It had 2 treadmills, a recumbant bike, 2 elliptical trainers, and I think it was one of those ski things. Anyways, the cardio equipment were equipped with personal cable TV's. It had a small area for free weights, had one multi-purpose lifting machine, and a weight bench. It was satisfactory. The business center was pay per use. Check-in was friendly; however, checkout was not after expressing my dissatisfaction with the outside noise on the O'Farrell side of the hotel. Overall, NOT a 4-star.

Upgraded us to a suite with a huge walk-in shower with stereo and t.v. in it. 7 shower heads, one of which was about 10 inches in diameter. Talk about not wanting to get out. The room was on the back side of the hotel, Room 401, no view which was fine with us because there was almost no road noise. One word of caution, this area is a little iffy. If you're not comfortable with homeless or panhandlers, its probably better to take taxis or stay at Fisherman's Wharf. We rented a car for one day, with a GPS navigator for an extra $12. Best $12 we ever spent. Don't rent a car without one. It's especially great because of all the one way streets in SF. The rest of the days there we used the public transportation. If you don't mind buses, this is a good deal. We spent $18 each for a 3 day muni-pass which allowed us access to all the buses, cables cars, and old time trolley cars. We went all over the city. It took us a little longer, but we didn't have to worry about paying for parking. If you like Thai food, try the Osha Thai Noodle Cafe. It's the best Thai food we've ever had.

We also arranged for a late check-in, since we would be driving up from Los Angeles after work. We had confirmation online, as well as over the phone a few days earlier. When we arrived at the hotel at 2 in the morning after an extremely long drive, we were not greeted by any staff. We then proceeded to check in at the front desk, when the staff member simply looked at us and said, \"Nope. There's 4 of you, but we only have you down for a single room with 1 bed.\" We disagreed, and explained that we had Pre-Paid for a double room. We even showed him the itinerary and invoice we had printed online. He just shook his head and said, \"Nope.\" He told us that all of their double rooms have been booked. He never apologized, and even got defensive saying that this was not the hotel's fault. He did not try to accommodate us at all for their mistake. When we were about to leave, he hesitantly offered us 2 separate smoking rooms. We definitely did not want to take the smoking rooms, so he then offered a suite..but we would have to pay the difference in price. Why should we have to pay more for a suite after they gave up the room that we had already reserved AND paid for?! So fine, we were so tired, we just agreed to stay in the separate single rooms for that night. The next morning, after talking to the manager of housekeeping, we were moved to a double room with 1 bed and a sofa bed (which we had to call down to the front desk again because we had no blankets/pillows for the sofa bed). For our inconvenience, they also gave us a voucher for a continental breakfast for 2, even though there were 4 of us. Whatever. When we went to redeem our voucher in the morning, their restaurant had closed early without any notice, so we were not able to get our breakfast. Lastly, upon checking out, we noticed that they had charged us an extra $120 for a late check-in! We had already arranged for a late check-in prior, and had already paid for everything in advance, but they still tried to charge us when we were leaving!! Our stay was a complete disaster, and not a single staff member was at all apologetic for their mistakes, or friendly at all for that matter. DO NOT STAY AT THE SERRANO. They treated us as if we were trying to get something for free, when all we wanted was what we had paid for!

My husband left his credit card in a nearby ATM just before we checked out. When he went to pay he realised and had to use my card . He explained to staff what had happened and then spent 45 mins trying to get through to cc company in UK on his mobile to cancel the card , he was very stressed as the calls were being frequently cut off. The reception staff did nothing to help, did not offer him the use of their phone or a private room as he had checked out.

The hotel is a very cool boutique property, part of the Kimpton chain. It's located in the Union Square West area, about 2 1/2 blocks from the square itself and about the same distance from the Powell Street cable car turnaround and BART/Muni station. The lobby is small, warm and boutique-chic, with ambient music playing in the background and pleasant sitting areas. The staff, from the doormen to the concierge to the front desk people, are warm and friendly, always greeting you when you walk through the door. There were only two elevators, but given that the hotel has only about 200-something rooms on 14 or so floors, that was rarely a problem. My room, a queen, was compact, but well-equipped and the space was well utilized. The Serrano is decorated in a more traditional motif than the modern minimalism that's more typical these days, with quirky light fixtures and an attractive burgundy color scheme. The bed was very comfortable, perhaps a little firmer than I like but that was a minor gripe. The armoire contained the television, minibar and closet, including two faux leopard-skin bathrobes. The bathroom was small, but with an ample shower and tub, and niceties such as Aveda bath products. The room also contained a few offbeat extras, such as a yoyo and mini Etch-a-Sketch. I didn't try the room service from the onsite restaurant, Ponzu, but the menu looked innovative. The hotel offered a daily wine reception in the lobby at 5 p.m., and there was free coffee (of good quality) in the lobby in the mornings. The location was great, close to the Union Square shopping district and lots of public transit - BART subway, MUNI buses and streetcars, and the famous cable cars. (Although you'll spend all day waiting for one at the Powell Street turnaround - best to take the Wharf trolley around to cheesy Fisherman's Wharf and take the cable car from there back to Powell Street). Yes, the seedy Tenderloin is a couple of blocks away, but the immediate area around the Serrano is your typical downtown commercial district, full of restaurants, fast food joints, offices etc etc. Dining options within a few blocks are legion, including a 24-hour Indian restaurant, Thai, Japanese, steakhouses and so on and so on.

However, I do not care to stay at the Serrano again. So, that compensation is meaningless. The bathroom was very small and a lot of water leaked from the shower whenever we used it.

The De Young is pretty cool as will be Piano's museum across from the De Young (under construction Dec. 2006). Golden Gate park is totally beautiful.

It was our first time at a Kimpton hotel and if we can afford it, we will certainly stay at Kimpton's in other cities in our future travels. The Serrano has so much character. It has been beautifully restored/maintained and is very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we met a number of other guests and the manager at the complementary evening wine receptions. Other guests have commented on the proximity to the \"tenderloin\" (a less 'upscale' area of SF). I must admit that had me worried a bit prior to our arrival, but we felt safe walking to both union sq area and the fisherman's wharf area from the Serrano. The proximity to all we wanted to do in SF was exceptional. Interestingly, the Hilton is kitty corner from the Serrano - and one wouldn't often think of a Hilton being in a rough area..... Our room was very quiet (I took someone's advice and requested a room away from the elevator) and very clean. I know a number of guests have commented on the small bathroom - but how much room do you really need and I'd much rather it was clean than large. Around the corner (.5 block) on O'Farrell are a number of car rental places, so take everyone's advice and only rent a car for the days you want to travel outside of SF - as the parking is VERY expensive. Just as an FYI, the cable car line ups at both Union Sq. and at Fisherman's wharf are REALLY long.... So, listen to the advice of the locals and catch it at a stop along the way and save yourself some time and energy. It's one of those must do tourist things... SF is a great city to visit.

This hotel was great, and I recommend it to anyone. It is centrally located 3 blocks from Union Square and is clean and quiet. The Serrano Hotel, by contrast, although also a Kimpton Hotel, was very disappointing. My negative experience began with the reservationist who booked a King Room for us, I doubly confirmed this because I knew that the city was extremely booked at this time. When we checked in, the woman at the front desk was thoroughly overwhelmed and seemed anxious. She was very rushed and curt. Also, when we arrived we found our room to have only a queen sized bed instead of a king, and the room felt so cramped we were feeling clausterphobic as soon as we walked in. The bathroom was clean, in good working order, and had nice ammenities and fixtures but it too felt cramped. The room we stayed in was on the 4th floor and it was rectangular in shape, the foot of the queen sized bed reached the wall, not leaving much room around it. The comforter has loose threads and appeared worn, and the sheets looked dusty and had lint on them. It was extremely noisy in the area from construction and the windows did not block out any of the noise. We immediately called the front desk to inquire, and they left us on hold for so long that the line disconnected, and when I called again, another woman said the original person was on hold with someone else and she would have them call us back. However, we did not receive a call back for ten minutes so we decided to get out of the room and go to the front desk immediately. When we inquired about why we were given a queen room, we were told that all the king rooms had been booked. I assured her that we had booked a king room and she said there was nothing she could do about it. When I told her that we would like to check out and find another hotel, she said that was fine but that our credit card would be charged anyways for the stay and that there was nothing she could do about it. When I asked to speak with the original reservationist, he did some research and told us that they had no king rooms available, but that one might open up later, but they couldn't promise anything. I explained that he had not told us this from the beginning and that we should be able to leave without getting charged, since it had been their mistake. He finally said the manager would take care of us and let me go. Pam, the fron desk manager, apologized profusely and I overheard her on the phone booking restaurant reservations for a guest and she seemed wonderfully helpful. She was the only positive experience in the 45 minutes I spent in the hotel. All of that being said, if you are willing to spend $215+ during peak season for a small queen room that has a Victorian feel in the lobby, then these are the benefits: *4 blocks to Union Square *Attentive Bellman (At least the one who was there at the time, he was the only one who asked if he could be of any help) *Game tables in the lobby, a fireplace and a restaurant (we did not eat there) *Some of the higher rooms may have nice views, we were told that they did by the reservationist because they have more than 17 floors *Pam, the front desk manager, who seemed very interested in making everyone's stay a great one *Updated bathroom *Victorian feel I would definitely recommend the Hotel Palomar over Serrano, we paid less for more space, better customer service, and awesome amenities.

Note that valet parking through the hotel will add $40+ a day to your cost, unless you use the parking facility next door on Taylor that costs half as much and has in and out capacity.", "Date": "March 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved The Serrano\u201d", "Author": "cheekymonkey", "ReviewID": "UR4624618", "Content": "We have just returned from San Francisco on Mar.13th.

And I'm hard to impress!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4583081", "Content": "I have traveled extensively for business for the last two decades and belong to several hotel group frequent guest programs. I've stayed at Westins, Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons, Pan Pacific Hotels, and Intercontinentals as well as small hotels in Europe and on the complete opposite end of the spectrum there have been the occassional Holiday Inns and the like. I also know San Francisco quite well and am there a few times every year. This trip was last minute and I could not get into the usual St. Francis or W or Palace due to the convention having them all booked. The Serrano was on the convention hotel list and the day before the convention a room did open up for $199 a night. The price without a convention in town, I understand, would be $149 and I'm sure much less for travelers able to use priceline or similar sites. For this location in this city, and the quality of the accommodations here, you just cannot beat this hotel for the price. I don't know where to begin. The location is perfect, a 2 minute walk from Union Square with it's transportation and everything else and about 15 minutes at most to the Moscone center. The lobby is absolutely beautiful but small enough to feel like a vey large living room, especially during the free coffee service from 5 a.m to 10 a.m. daily and the free evening wine reception. It's great fun to talk to and meet other people during these times and I imagine for the single recreational traveler this would be quite a plus. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, unlike say, the St. Francis which has suffered a severe drop in service points with me during the past few years. At the Serrano, if you have a whim they will make every effort to indulge it. When I emerged from the taxi in front a bellman was there, immediately asked my name, and has remembered it ever since (I'm still here as I write). The front desk staff upon check in were joking and so friendly that I felt like I was coming to visit my cousins or friends who I have known forever. My room is slightly small, but has a king bed with desk large enough to spread my work out on, a well-stocked minibar, and is beautifully decorated. The bathroom is quite small with powder-room sized sink and toilet, but also beautifully appointed with leopard bathrobe and Aveda toiletries. The tub is deep, although a bit more narrow than average. If an extremely large person wanted to take a bath rather than shower it may be problematic. But some rooms here do have jacuzzi tubs for two. There is little space to put your own toiletry kits but that's fine, I put mine on the floor under the sink. Small inconvenience considering everything else. Everything is spotlessly clean. I am on a higher floor and asked for a quiet room but since the windows are double paned I don't think lower floor rooms would have a noise problem. I can't even hear sirens going by. I see them but can't hear them. Today I worked in my room all morning and did not hear the housekeeping staff banging around in the rooms next to me. Didn't hear them rumbling through the hall. But they must have because when I finally left at noon, all the rooms on the floor had been done and they were just waiting for me. There is a couple with a toddler of I would say almost two, across the hall. I have seen her at the elevator, I've seen her in the lobby, I've never heard her once while in my room, morning or night. The bed is extremely comfortable with feather pillows and mattress topper for softness. The heat/ac works well and is not loud. I have heard extremely little noise from the rooms on the other sides of my walls and have been here three days. I have heard no one else's tv, alarm clock, or phone. And I know there are people in those rooms. For the business traveler, if you worry that you will miss some amenities you are used to at the bigger more expensive chains-don't! The HUGE plusses for business are the FREE high speed internet in every room and the business center where there are computers in case yours dies, also with free internet, and get this folks: FREE printer and fax. No charge at all. The business center is small but so is the hotel so it's not crowded. You needn't go searching for a place or pay to print something, just take your disk or memory stick downstairs and you can print. Oh yes, the little business center is open 24 hours! There is also an iron and ironing board, essential for the business person, and a cordless phone which is nice. The only drawbacks I see for business purposes is the lack of a coffemaker in the room and the fact that room service and the restaurant are not 24-hour and both open at 7 a.m. So, if you have a very early meeting and have to leave before that, at least you can have coffee from the lobby beginning at 5 a.m. But, since there is the minibar you can always walk the half block to Walgreens and buy your breakfast yogurt and apple or danish or whatever and keep it in your room for the next day. For any kind of traveler, the other interesting plusses are the yo-yo, mini etch-a-sketch, cards, and puzzle games in the room. They are open and free to use, you only pay if you take them with you. Also each room is furnished with an oversized umbrella, also free as long as you don't take it home. There are games in the lobby as well and the front desk stocks a large number of board-type games you can borrow for FREE-great for families. And for couples, well, they do offer Twister and well, um, given the size of my particular room the only place I can imagine putting the Twister mat would be um, atop the king-sized bed. Ahem. ok enough of that. There is a small, but adequate fitness room with two treadmills, two recumbant bikes, free weights, and a universal machine. It is well-stocked with towels, reading material, water, and a nice plasma tv on the wall. Everytime I checked in there, it wasn't crowded, maybe one other person. Oh yes, and unlike most OTHER hotel fitness rooms, this one is open 24 hours. And of course, it is FREE. I keep being astounded at the FREE internet and business center. Those bigger expensive chains charge an arm and a leg for these things and dopes that we are, we pay it because we think we need it so badly. Well, now that I know it can be had for FREE..... This hotel is fond of yoga and you may watch the instructional 24-hour yoga channel on the television, do the relaxing yoga poses detailed in the booklet on your desk, or for a very reasonable fee, get a yoga basket with mat/yoga pillow etc from the front desk. For a fee, they also offer in room massage, manicure, pedicure. If traveling with children you may want to ask the size of the rooms that have two double beds as putting a rollaway in the room I have for just one child would be rather cramped, I think. But it could be done. In a few reviews I read here that helped me decide to book the Serrano, people complained of the location-well, everyone who has been to this city a couple of times knows not to walk too far past Taylor St. from Union Square or else you are in the Tenderloin but really, I am female and am quite comfortable walking back to the Serrano at 11 p.m. alone as I am coming from the direction of Union Square. But I know the city pretty well. Yes, there are tons of homeless in the Union Square area and there always have been but they are harmless and this is where the tourist or business person wants to be. They are outside the hotels that cost $400 a night too. I never give them money BUT, when coming back from a business dinner I always ask for a box for my leftovers and as I don't plan to stuff them into my little minibar, I give them to one of the homeless people. I've never had one single person refuse or not be extremely delighted. The hotel restaurant, Ponzu, has a small menu but the asian-fusion dinner entrees are fantastic-they do border on the Thai in terms of spicy so keep that in mind. There are so many other fantastic restaurants at every price range within a few blocks that no one should have any problem finding something to suit. The only complaint I have, is that I did once have breakfast at Ponzu and the service was extremely slow. Perhaps they were short-staffed or something. But, having said that, I must mention that my waitress bent over backwards to explain every tiny delay (\"I'm sorry I think we are out of grapefruit juice it will take me a minute to check,\" \"I apologize, but that table over there has been waiting longer and as soon as I get their meals from the kitchen I will check on how yours is coming,\") and she was constantly freshening my coffee \"so it doesn't get cold on you\" and so forth. So that made up for the slowness. I write for a living and do tend to go on but really, I've never stayed at a Kimpton hotel before but definitely now want to try them all. The Serrano is rated as a four-star but I would say it deserves a 4.5. I sometimes come to San Francisco for fun, not work, and after staying here I think I would rather spend $149 a night to stay here than to use my frequent guest points and stay at the St. Francis for free. The Serrano is that pleasant!I just can't say enough.", "Date": "March 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice suites with decent view\u201d", "Author": "rmwhitt", "ReviewID": "UR4370451", "Content": "Stayed at Hotel Serrano for 5 nights (Jan. 06).

We had a B&B package that provided an OK (not exciting) continental breakfast at the adjacent restaurant.

The whirlpool tub is wonderful, especially if you have a chance to purchase some Lush bath bombs or bubble bars. The Aveda products were a plus.

I went back to the front desk and they promptly switched me to a larger room and arranged to have my bags moved the next day while I was out, with a comped breakfast for the inconvenience.

We mentioned that we were honeymooners (shhh...we always do, that's our little secret tip) and we were upgraded to a suite at no additional charge. The suite was FABULOUS with a separate living area and a humongous bathroom with a jacuzzi tub big enough for two(the tub was a life saver after walking the hills of Frisco!) They also sent us a bottle of wine, which was a very classy touch. The decor and ambiance, both of the lobby and the suite was exceptional. We LOVED wine hour and made sure to never miss it! As far as the negative reviews of the staff, I can say that we never had an incident, and were treated with courtesy and a smile on all counts. The concierge staff, including John and Chad, were also excellent. Restaurants a plenty in the area, we loved Muang Thai next door, next to it was a smaller place that had great breakfasts (cheapest in the area) The only drawback to this hotel is the area, as mentioned in so many previous reviews. In case you do not know, Frisco has a big homeless problem and it seemed that the beggars concentrated in the area immediately surrounding the hotel as well as Union Square, which is close by (4 blocks). There are also several asian massage parlors in the immediate area, and in case you've never run into these, they are simply store fronts for brothels. We even saw a street walker or two, also in the immediate area. Ahem. We never felt threatened, but it definitely was a big turnoff in a otherwise lovely city. TIPS: 1) No need for a taxi from the airport, save $35 and use the BART, it is amazingly clean (UNLIKE our subways in NYC), easy to use and only $5.00 per person. It leaves you directly next to the cable car line in Union Sq and is a 10 minute walk to the hotel. 2) Do NOT rent a car! Parking is insanely expensive and public transportation is very good; I promise, you will not miss having a car (xcept at the end of the day when your feet ache from walking those HILLS!) You can even take a free shuttle bus to Muir Woods and over the Golden Gate bridge! If you must rent a car, rent for a day and do all the things you need a car for (Napa Valley, Carmel, Monterey, Sausalito, etc) 3) Rest up and do the cable car thing EARLY, the lines can be an hour long (Make sure to take the Hyde line, it is the most scenic). You can do Ghiardelli Square, Hyde Pier, Fishermans Wharf AND Alcatraz all in one day, if you get out early enough. WEAR YOUR WALKING SHOES! 4) Book Alcatraz in advance, it sells out quickly. Get the audio tour for a few dollars more, it is well worth it!

I have some serious reservations about the hotel but overall would recommend it. The location of the Serrano hotel is remarkably mixed. Its immediate surroundings are parking lots, run-down convenience stores, and seedy massage parlors. However, just a block away are several luxury hotels and a small theatre district, so clearly this is not a bad neighborhood. And despite the surroundings I never felt unsafe during my stay here. Also, the Serrano is an excellent location for staging forays into the city. In one direction is Nob hill, about six blocks away (although I warn you, that is six blocks UPHILL) while the Powell street transportation complex (Cable Cars, Surface Street Cars, BART, and City Subway) is about five blocks in the other direction. Also at the Powell street complex is \u201cSan Francisco Place\u201d, which is a gorgeous, very upscale, suburban shopping mall, with a Norstroms and the other usual suspects. The d\u00e9cor of the foyer is elaborate and confused. It seems to be a cross between ancient Egypt and baroque Venice. I found it amusing eye candy when I first entered. Three days later it struck me as a bit labored and depressing. The important thing is that the lobby is bright and clean and pleasantly laid out. There is a bell captain inside to deal with your bags, and valets outside to hail you a cab. Every day there is a happy hour in the foyer. Wines are nice (although, I\u2019m no connoisseur, just a gleeful alcohol consumer), the food is not\u2014just a step up from pretzels and chips. Two elevators plus a service elevator (which I used often) only adequately cover the building. Two very highly recommended features of this hotel is the exercise room and business center. The exercise room has an excellent selection of tread mills and other stationary exercise equipment. It is thoughtfully furnished with ample clean towels\u2014nice touch. The business center features three web-ready PCs plus a printer and fax machine. Incoming fax are free, and computer usage and moderate paper supplies are free. Outgoing long distance fax charges apply. Note that with only three PCs you might have to wait, but it is better than the no service at all that many other hotels in this price range offer. While the d\u00e9cor of the foyer is quite questionable, upstairs everything is first rate. The corridors and rooms are modestly and elegantly decorated. Everything of course, very clean and well-maintained. As for the rooms themselves, they are small. I had a room with a single king or queen-sized bed and even though I was by myself it felt small. Part of the problem is that they cram a full complement of furniture (chair, desk, wardrobe-entertainment center) without any thought into a small room. The closet was also not full sized. If you\u2019re looking for a good way to test a relationship, you could do worse than share this room with your significant other. But the real problem with these rooms is the washrooms, they are very small. For those of you who have to have a full-sized tub (and why do you have to have that, huh?) your tub is there and is perfectly fine. The problem is that there is very little room left for the toilet. It is squeezed almost under the sink and mirror. Also, the hotel has made a very serious mistake in placing only a small shelf to set your toiletries on and in selecting a sink that has a banked perimeter so you have to very carefully set anything on the surface of the sink or it will fall off. I\u2019m warning you, close the toilet seat before you brush your teeth or change your contact lenses. I had a decent view looking North up towards Nob hill. Based on the surroundings, I don\u2019t believe any side of the hotel is going to offer you great views. The staff was generally helpful and pleasant although not overwhelmingly so. Not a significant positive or negative for the hotel. There is a restaurant on the first floor which serves contemporary cuisine. It is nicely decorated with a helpful wait staff. I had one meal here, vegetable stir fry, which was excellent. Overall, I would stay here again. It is a good location, and a nice place to come home too and the end of the day.

Looking at the pictures, I would have thought that it was a bit more Spanish in style. Really, its kind of decorated like a circus. That said, if you're into that, as opposed to the typical botique minimalism, its decorated like a high quality circus. The staff is friendly, and loan out cords for the high speed internet. The gym is serviceable, modern, and clean. There is a computer with networked printer for use. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but there are few rooms to a floor, so you feel a bit like its a private hotel.", "Date": "June 15, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cOh what a charmer\u201d", "Author": "ursirius", "ReviewID": "UR2149941", "Content": "Having read some of the reviews here, we called ahead and asked for a room with a view i.e. no brickwall to face. We got a lovely room on the 15th floor, maybe not huge but also not small. Maybe we got a room upgrade as well, wouldn't know as I have only seen that one room. Yes, the bathroom is a bit on a small side and we could have done with a bit more shelf space but hey, we can survive a few days without. The room itself was immaculate and very clean, it was nice for a change to be in bath/shower area with no black mold marks as are found even in the best hotels. When we arrived, the Lady at the reception, Pam, was busy and a bit dour. In no time though, she cheered up responding to our excitement. It was the end of long working day for her and even I think it is hard to look cheerful 24 hours a day. I don't know where the 'young not white people', who gave a review about them being racially biased were, most of the staff were people of colour, asians or new immigrants. The clientele we could see, was in all shades of colour and age. Maybe our young couple have just encountered a bad day, happens to the best of us. The location was also excellent (if you ignored the seedy direction), we walked everywhere i.e. DO NOT rent a car, besides the parking fees are huge $40.00 incl. tax a day for a taurus. If you must rent or drive up, left on O'farrel street is a much cheaper place, I think about $18.00 for 24 hours.
