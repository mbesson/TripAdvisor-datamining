The restaurant called Kitchen has a breakfast buffet that is worth making another trip to Hong Kong just to enjoy it. We checked out the pool at the top of the building and it was very trendy and affords excellent views of the city. While there we got around by using a two day Big Bus pass. We travelled first to downtown Kowloon using the hotel's courtesy shuttle and started our travels from there. At the end of the day we got off at a stop at the DHL balloon which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.

I have to say that this is my single favorite W property. I absolutely love the brand (I bought W towels and bedsheets for my own home) so I've stayed at a fair share of W's over the years. So what makes this W so great? The seem to do everything right. And when they don't, they make every effort to make it right. As a SPG Platinum member, I was pre-upgraded to a Fabulous Suite. There was a mix-up during a previous stay of mine, so they made sure I was taken care of at my next stay. The suite is fabulous as its name suggests. There is a 50\" LCD in the living room that's probably too big for the room (the couch is only about 6' away). When have you ever been in a hotel room that you can say the TV is realistically too large? In the bedroom, there is a high end B&O A&V system (although the remote is a bit difficult to use). I love that they didn't hold back on A&V as most hotels do. The bathroom is just as impressive. In addition to the overhead rain shower, they have 3 small jets that project water horizontally. When both are fully turned on, its like taking a bath standing up! In additon, they provide extra large Bliss spa toilettries. Those happened to find a way straight to my suitcase on check-out. As others have reviewed, the breakfast at Kitchen is excellent. SPG Plats receive free continental (cold only) with an optional $100HKG upgrade to the full. Between the selection and quality of the food, this is one of the best breakfast spreads I have ever had. The rooftop pool was closed because of the typhoon, however I've used it during previous stays. Like everything else at this hotel, it is very impressive. My only negative for the hotel is the location. Its super convenient to the Airport Express so getting to/from the airport is a piece if cake. However, getting to Central is not as easy. It takes one long subway stop and a 10 minute walk to get to the good parts of Central. That might not seem as much, but for a city as closely packed as HK, its a bit of a trek. The hotel is plenty good enough to make this a non-issue, but if access to Central is your #1 priority, this may not be the best hotel for you.

Overall, the location of this hotel is very well rounded. -SPG recognition is pretty high. I've always been upgraded. Not always to a suite but usually to a much better room than booked. - The rooms. I really like the style of the rooms and I think they are very functional and trendy. -Ambiance, The W Hong Kong doesn't give off the vibe of some of the other hotels in the W Chain, which is a good thing. I don't necessary feel like i'm in a club every time I walk through the hotel. -F+B, The food at the hotel is very good, I've had some very good breakfasts here. -Pool, this is one of my favorite hotel pools in the world. I could spend a whole vacation sitting by the pool. Cons: - The service execution is very average at times. It's three star quality, and when i'm paying five star prices I want five star quality.

I arrived late, and had a very friendly check in experience, with a room upgrade which was a lovely touch. Bags taken to the room without hesitation and the bar team looked after all of our requests even though they were due to close in five minutes. Great art installation at present, and mixologist are of a reasonable standard. Our waitress was very friendly and advised us of her name, (emma) and what promotions were happening and when. Suite lived up to it's name \"fabulous\". Views incredible, and all amenities accounted for - excellent steam iron, good water pressure and temperature. Some quirks - UK iPhone could not play through main tv even after following instructions. And a word of warning, when you walk into your room the slot for your key card to turn on the lights is very difficult to locate, as there is NO light in he room, and very little from the corridor. Bed was comfortable, but I struggled to get the lights to turn off for sleeping. The system is complex and not very intuitive. I did have a letter advising me of renovations but I was not affected by any noise or construction presence. Breakfast choice is huge - with the ambient and cold items of a lovely quality. The hot breakfast is good in choice, but poor on execution. Mine was cold... Coffee is delicious and the service on morning one was really lovely, and morning two lacking in presence or friendliness. Pool area is quite special from a view perspective, but the service is just rubbish. Which is a shame because the drinks that were mixed for us were lovely, when we eventually got them. The presentation of the bar area is cluttered and feels back of house, and like an after thought, which could explain why the team were disengaged and lacked energy. The lifeguard and towel team were very friendly and took the time to show us the best place to sit for views, breeze and sunshine. Check out was reasonable, bag stores and taxi finding wasn't.... Which unfortunately my last customer touch point. Overall the hard product is exceptional, and the environment is typical W. and yes it is loud, in your face, designed to wake up your youthful senses, and that is why you stay at W. However, the service doesn't make the W, in fact it breaks the W promise of a wonderful stay. Some team members trying too hard to be as pretentious as some of the W guests, which is not only letting some of the great team members down, it is letting the opportunity of being a fabulous EXPERIENCE slip through the net.

Location is not the best and quite far from the beat of Kowloon... Check-in was ok, quite unpersonal with a bit nose up/arrogant male receptionist...who does not really care to give you any info about any facility of the hotel... Had to request to change of room as the first one was smelling a kind of wet paint... part of the rooms at this time are already under renovation... quite surprising for an hotel opens for than less 2 years... Same receptionist changed and escorted me to a second room, same situation and when I informed him about the smell, he replied to me that it is probably the W smell... I did not know that the smell of this brand is made with paint... Unfortunately for this male receptionist I stayed in several W properties and for sure this smell is not the W smell. As I had only one night to spent there I did not want to change again of room.... but this gentleman must be careful to confirm such incorrect info especially when you are facing a fan as me of W. Definitely a bad point for them... Went to the pool, nice, breathtaking but main issue is at 2pm there is no more sun and you have to squeeze in a very tiny part of the terrace if you want to enjoy a bit some sun.... I know that usually Asians are not really keen about sunbathing but what about us...???? Stayed there for almost 2 hours, no one from the bar or the pool came to ask me if I want to drink or eat something... too bad for them... a lot of staff... just making wind and not much more... When back to my room (3208), some very annoying noises of drilling were on until I phoned to their operator who informed that there are some renovations going on... too bad that a notice is not displayed in the room to inform... TV channels are not really clear and many times cut by \"no signal\", quite annoying at the end if you try to watch a movie as I did... Evening turndown service was done at 5.40pm, a bit early by a great gentleman very polite and professional who actually the only one to ask me if I need something... Wanted to check my e-mails and got the info that internet is not included in the room rate and have to pay 40 HKD per hour... such ridiculous and cheap it is,,, if you do not want to pay you can go down to the 6th floor where is the lobby and bars of the hotel to enjoy a complimentary wireless but you have to order a drink who cost you more than 40 HKD per hour. Such a shame for W to be so cheap of not including internet in the room.... Good point of the room was I watched for more than of one hour the sunset from the daybed and was great and certainly THE memory of this stay. Check-out was fully inpersonal, no one to assist with your luggage or to assist you with the elevator... maybe too early when I left at 7.30pm... In conclusion, the hotel has good points and go for there if you like trendy but for the W effect from the team go somewhere like in Taipei as I did not find it in Hong Kong...

We actually live in Shenzhen - the great city immediately to the north of Hong Kong - but I was leaving for Taipei, so I HAD to stay in Hong Kong before I could go back to mainland after Taiwan, and I didn't book the hotel until 20 days beforehand - well, sorry that's another story. My point is therefore W Hotel was kinda pricy to me (compared to many other non-branded upper upscale hotels in HKG), but it was worth a visit to the leading boutique hotel and the adjacent Elements Mall. $$$$$ was well-spent. The location is great. The hotel is right above the Kowloon Train Station, and it's only 20-30 minutes train (subway) ride from the airport if my memory is correct. Based on my experience, the train still ran at 9:40PM and 5AM. Also, I flew Cathay Pacific to Taipei and got checked in right at the train station, so I didn't have to carry my checked bags to go on the train- I liked it so much. It's connected to the Elements Mall, and I personally liked it better than the Harbor City because it was newer and far less crowded. I had no trouble finding things I wanted that I would be able to get at the Harbor City. Front desk staff spoke fluent English and okay Mandarin. Hotel staff were nice and always greeted us with smiles, especially service people at breakfast buffet. W Hong Kong truly met its service level and my expectations. On the first night, we chcked in late and were lucky to get upgraded to a harbor view double room for two nights. Beds were really comfortable, and I absolutely loved the compartmentalized bathroom. I had never used Bliss before, but in-room Bliss body/skin-care products totally turned me into a loyal Bliss customer now. Use of technology and decor were very advanced and artsy, but not too overwhelming. Their housekeeping did a good job, too. It has happened to me many times before that your room didn't get fully cleaned if your stay is longer, but everything looked nice and clean again like a new guestroom after housekeepers came in on our second day. I also used their infinity pool. You'll have to try it, if it's your first stay at the W Hong Kong. It was just so good to see all the skyscrapers nearby in your bathing suits on that fancy rooftop. Although I could smell the chemicals, my hair was fine after swimming in the pool. I heared the spa is really good too. Breakfast was good but not impressive, basic Western style.

Other 5-star hotels will find it difficult to match up to the high service standards offered by them! This high service standard is maintained consistently across all departments, right from the moment you enter the hotel to the very moment you check-out. The concierge staff who greeted me was warm and cheerful. With a very good command of English, he directed me to the check-in counter at Level 6. Upon reaching the front desk, I was greeted by Francis, who processed my check-in efficiently. He also made some small chats with me and I really like his friendliness and enthusiasm. I was initially a bit worried whether or not I would get a room at 8am but the early check-in request was granted and the whole check-in process was a breeze! I was up in my room within minutes! The luggage also came promptly and I was ready to start my day in the Pearl of the Orient! The Cool Corner room was very spacious and came with full amenities, including their signature Bliss toiletries. In particular, I love the ensuite bathroom as it came with a magnificent view of Victoria Harbour. The bed was very comfortable to sleep on and the flat-screen TV came with numerous entertainment options. The decor was very chic too and it gave a homely feeling at the same time. During the stay, I managed to go up to the rooftop pool on the 76th level for a few laps. The view of Victoria Harbour was brilliant. It's a place where guests shouldn't miss out on! Although I didn't use the gym, I did briefly stop by to take a look and was impressed by the equipment - latest and comprehensive! All in all, I had a terrific stay at W Hong Kong and I'm looking forward to many more stays at this outstanding hotel located in the heart of Hong Kong. A tip for all guests who have intention to stay at W Hong Kong - take the Airport Express and alight at Kowloon station. Upon arrival at the station, there are clear signages which lead you to the hotel.

The hotel is typical W style, but dark and a bit dreary for my liking. Every surface in the room is a shade of dark gray, which made me feel a little depressed in all honesty. The bathroom counter top was concrete, I think, and had two planks that jetted out into the room with sharp edges/corners and was quite dangerous for our (18mo old) son, who nearly knocked his head/face on them about 50 times - I had to watch him like a hawk! (Yes, I realize that W is not reknown for being child-friendly, but nonetheless...) On the positive side, the beds/pillows were incredibly comfortable, the tub was nice and deep, and my favorite random feature of the room was back lighting behind the toilet paper roll which was a perfect night light - so if you get up to go to the bathroom, you are not fumbing in the dark. The pool on the roof was cool, but it dampens the \"top of the world\" feeling when the building next door soars another 50 storeys or so higher than where you are. The staff were all very friendly and the location was ideal for us - the attached mall and train station straight to the airport (and the fact that you can check your bags right there!) couldn't have worked out better. We decided to have breakfast at one of the many amazing bakeries in the mall instead of at the hotel and it was great.

I would like to compliment Cyndee who have assisting me in some of the pre-request that I wanted. Although not all are granted, the service from her was excellence. However, the bad experience came from the arrival. I am totally disappointed with the concierge team. I came with my friend by taxi to W Hong Kong with 2 big luggages and upon arrival, none of the staff came to approach us or even help us in our luggage. That happen a few times when I returned back to hotel by taxi. That was the first impression of my visit. I drag the luggage up to the lobby at 6th floor and do the check in. Check-in staffs are reasonable good, young and trendy which match W style. They do communicate well in English. We went up to the room and it was what we expected, a clean, nice and trendy W room which I loved it. We got a welcome letter from the manager for SPG platinum member. After that I went back to the lobby to look for Cyndee. I have pre-arranged a cake for my friend's birthday and also arrange a surprise limousine back to the airport. I told Cyndee that I will pass a box of chocolate to be delivered with the cake at midnight and it was perfectly done. Good job, Cyndee. However, my surprise limousine was ruined by the concierge AGAIN. I fully paid for the limousine on the spot so that my friend wouldn't know about it and I mentioned to them that it was meant to be a surprise so I do not want the limousine service to be reflected in the room bill. But the concierge left a message in the room and also delivered a letter to the room. My friend saw it and even advice me to cancel as it is not necessary because airport express is just round the corner. At that point, I did want to cancel it cos is no longer a surprise. Word of advice: Never trust the concierge to do things. W Hong Kong location was good as is near to MTR and also next to Elements mall. The view was good. After coming back to the hotels, I decided to visit the steam room next to the gym. Door was automated using key card so only hotel guest can access. 3 mins after I step in, W staff came in. For one moment, I thought I was at Sheraton. An \"uncle\" who doesn't match W style approaches me. I told him I wanted to use the steam room and he asks rudely:\" Are you the guest here?\" I show him my key card. Why would he ask a question when the door required key cards to enter. Not only that, most of the lockers are locked when only 3 guests using the gym and steam room. Most of them are not stocked up too. No comments to Woo bar. Breakfast at the Kitchen was good but only 3 chefs attending and no one attending the crepe section. Staff at the pool was attentive too and approaches us when we were there. Finally is time for us to check out, the staff should have informed the concierge to assist us in either taxi or airport transfer but none was offered. In my case was airport transfer. I drag my luggage to the ground level and told them that I have the limousine service. Sam was kind and helpful to end the trip with W Hong Kong. Good Job, Sam.

This is especially great if you have a late flight and you have to check out of your hotel. There is always the problem about what to do with your luggage. Hotels will hold on to them for you if you want but this way you can check your luggage in which means you don't have to be at the airport so early giving you more time to shop!!!!

I'd previously looked at the W's hotel and thought that it was a bit too clever by half. Shamefaced, I must confess to you that it was I who was too clever by half and that this is one of the finest hotels in which I have stayed. The staff were a friendly bunch, always happy to help. It was nice to be offered an upgrade and I didn't get a frown when I said I couldn't have that room because it was on a smoking floor. I think that's what she said. Anyway, no problem, she said, and dug up another one for me, with a view of Victoria Harbour. The room is spacious, the bed gigantic, the view brilliant. The room is full of really clever touches, the bathroom is well designed and clean with very nice amenity packs laid out. The room was extremely soothing which was a bit of a surprise because if I had one criticism of the thorough check-in service, it was that the thumping music from the bar made it hard to hear. The W sits atop the Elements shopping mall which has a few very nice restaurants and is just a few minutes walk into Kowloon MTR. If you're arriving late at night - or early in the morning - it is very handily placed for the Airport Express train. The hotel staff go to great lengths to help you out with late check-out and offers of showers in the gym if you can't be in the room. The epic breakfast is something to behold. It's a brilliant mix of whatever you might want or need. There's no point in me going through a list because it's too long. It more than matches Le Meridien's epic efforts. If you can, then do.

After hearing many rave reviews about this property, including its convenient [walking] proximity to Kowloon Station, we decided to give it a go and spend our first night in Hong Kong here. A room at the W Hong Kong usually sells for somewhere in the $380 range, so having the ability to redeem SPG points definitely factored into our decision to stay here. We lucked out and were able to book a room for 12,000 Starpoints literally a day before the property had increased its redemption rate to 20,000 points. We arrived in Hong Kong a little before 5:00 am. The Airport Express MTR at HKG does not begin service until 5:54 am, so we headed straight to the Cathay Pacific First Class Arrival Lounge to freshen up and grab a bite to eat. Two one-way tickets from HGK Airport to Kowloon station cost us 140.00 HKG (~$18.50), and it was about a 20-minute ride. Upon arrival at Kowloon Station, getting to the hotel was a breeze. We followed the signs to the W Hong Kong by walking through the upscale Elements Shopping Mall, leading us to the entrance of the hotel. It was so nice to just be able to go straight from the airport to Kowloon Station,and not have to worry about getting a taxi to take us to the hotel, especially after a long flight. I was really impressed with my first glimpse the hotel; it totally embodied everything you\u2019d expect from the W brand \u2013 upscale, trendy, artistic and unique. The lobby had a distinguished artistic flair in its design and decor. Since we obviously arrived at the hotel wayyyy before the standard check-in time, we had to wait about an hour for a room. In the meantime, we used the wait time and free lobby wifi to our advantage by answering emails and making phone calls back home. Though the W is not exactly walkable to the heart of Kowloon as tourists know it (Tsim Sha Tsui), there is a free shuttle that runs every 30 minutes to the top tourist destinations nearby (Star Ferry Terminal, Avenue of the Stars, Nathan and Canton Roads, etc.). On the plus side, the W is walkable the popular OZONE bar (Ritz Carlton) located on the 118th floor of the International Commerce Centre, the third tallest building in the world. Unfortunately, our unplanned jet-lag naps prevented us from checking it out (next time, for sure). We were given a room on the 29th floor, and it was absolutely fantastic. The room was bright and modern with great floor-to-ceiling windows. The bathroom featured a European open-floor plan, which I have grown to love in modern hotel design. After about 20 minutes in the room, the jet-lag creeped upon us, and without even knowing it, we slept a solid 7 hours. Whoops. Once we mustered the energy to get out of bed, we decided to take advantage of the free shuttle service to the Avenue of the Stars and to catch the Symphony of Lights. Do note that there isn\u2019t a return shuttle service available. Once you are dropped off, you have to arrange your own transportation back to the hotel. Don\u2019t fret \u2013 our taxi back only cost the equivalence of $5. We returned back to the hotel at around 10:30 pm, and saw that there was a festive cheese and wine tasting event going on at the lobby bar. Priced at $43 per person, we passed on the tasting and opted to just order a cocktail instead. The ambiance and service of the lobby bar was great and was a perfect way to wind down our first night in Hong Kong. Everything about our stay at the W in Hong Kong was pleasant, and I\u2019d absolutely stay here again in a heart beat! Our beds were SO wonderful and comfortable! TV, desk, & lounge chair I loved the modern design and detail of the room. Mini-bar items available for purchase. We did get two complimentary water bottles though. High-tech shades and lights controls. Gorgeous open-floor plan bathroom. Fun, lighted vanity mirror.

The hotel staffs have always shown to be friendly and accommodating (except for suite upgrades), the beds/bedding have never disappointed, the convenience from the airport via the Airport Express link, and the adjacent Elements mall are all upsides that should not be ignored, but there are many options of newer hotels with superior views and more central locations to be considered.

Although it is far from the city center, it is well connected by train. You have direct access from the hotel to the train station and to Kowloon Shopping Mall with a wide range of first class shops for your entertainment. - First impression and Check in/check out process: The hotel opened in 2008 and it still has a new and modern feeling. It is located in a huge building and the lobby is on the sixth floor. This is quite unconfortable because the lifts are not very big and we always had to wait for them. On arrival, we also had to wait at the front desk because there was a long queue for the check in proccess. This area is too small for such a big hotel and there was really big crowd of people with guests waiting for checking in, guests going in/out of their rooms, staff members... Rooms: The room was a reasonable size and had floor to celling windows with front views over the new ICC tower. This is quite a pitty because it does not let you see Victoria Bay area. It had a king size bed with a Tivoli radio, and a full equiped bathroom with a separate toilet, a shower and a bath with a television. Internet Wireless System was not free in the room and you have to go downstais to the lobby for free internet connection. Facilities: There is a big swimming pool on the hotel roof with sun loungers and good views over the area. There is also a well equiped gym and a separate sauna and relaxing room for men and women. Restaurants: You can find freshly made juices and all sorts of bakery. However, service was very slow. It is a big hotel it gets crowded at peak times. Service: Staff members are young and some of them need more trainning. We saw a couple situations they did not manage efficiently. Conclusions: It is a hotel with a young and vibrant atmosphere, but it clearly needs to improve to be considered a 5 star hotel.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok, Krung Thep, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Cheng Z", "ReviewID": "UR129433957", "Content": "Still one of the best hotel on my list.

We travelled to Macau on Monday 5th. As we were planning to arrive in HK very early in the morning, we called the Hotel the night before to advise them that we needed an early check-in at 6.15am. We originally booked the wonderful room, but it wasn\u2019t ready then. However, we were offered the \u201cspectacular room\u201d with full ocean view for an extra charge. At that early time of the morning, no complaints, we were grateful we had a room. As you walked into the room (3803) we understood why it is called the \u201cspectacular room\u201d with full ocean view (photos), it has a fantastic luxurious feel, with unique W characteristics. Photos posted speak by themselves. You just don\u2019t want to leave the room, except if you are going to the gym, sauna or pool of the hotel. I was impressed with the gym facilities. Indeed, it is a proper fitness centre which is located on the 73 level. It has fantastic views while you are doing cardio. You can even find a PT if you need some fitness assistance. After the gym, you relax in the sauna located in the same level. We managed to use the pool on Tuesday 6 March, the only sunny day during our stay in HK. The pool or Wet deck on level 76 is wow! This is the highest outdoor pool in HK. I would like to go back in summer just to use the pool and have some drinks at the bar. W Hotel is located next to the Element Shopping Mall Centre where you can find up-market shops, cafes, a beautiful bakery, a supermarket, and nice restaurants. Kowloon Train station is just a short 5\u2019 stroll from the hotel where you can catch the airport express and do your early check-in before heading to the airport. The location of W hotel is great. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t see much of HK because of the weather conditions, but staying at the W made our HK trip an unforgettable one.

More important, the level of service is consistently excellent. Staff are proactive in asking if they can help, from the moment I arrive, a service I don't need as a regular, but do appreciate. And I love the rooms, especially the corner rooms and suites, with their view over the harbour. The W style is refreshingly different from the regular corporate hotels I often stay in. I also enjoy the Bliss bath products. My work usually requires that I eat away from the hotel, so I can't comment on the restaurant food there, but it is worth commenting that having a location in a shopping mall makes it very convenient to go out for meals in the restaurants there, and there is also a supermarket to go for snack foods.

I felt it was trying too hard, finding the hotel and staff somewhat brash when I like my service relaxed and unobtrusive. Arriving at night, the entrance was dark and inconspicuous for the first time visitor. The lift floor lights up in bright flashing blue and white. Reminsicent of a night club. The room facilities were generally good, though I found equipment difficult to operate - even the cordless phone did not work intuitively. TV was a bit unresponsive to the remote, but did delivery one of the nicest full-bodied sounds I've heard in a hotel. Some reviewers have thought the bathroom did not close off for privacy - if they had the same room style that I had, they are failing to observe that the mirrored walls them selves slide as one large whole and do close off the area. I wanted easier equipment and better room lighting. Even the 'daytime' rating was too low for me. After the first breakfast, I skipped in favour of Pret or Fairwood, who are amongst the many already in the mall complex. Hotel breakfast was short on selection and lighting a bit too subdued to allow an easy choice . Nevertheless, the overall standards were good and, in season, the 76th floor pool must be wonderful. The hotel offers a half-hourly one-way free shuttle to Tsim Sha Tsui - very necessary at the moment on account of the large amount of build and road work. Returning by taxi is only about 3USD. It was quite impressive, but perhaps an older person like myself, there on business, prefers life more gently toned and relaxed.

Overall, I would stay at the W again in a heartbeat while in Hong Kong if I'm not crashing with my family. It was a debate between the Ritz (also in the same complex) and the W and for the price and the space, I am so happy that I chose the W. And the convenience of the location is something to consider. It is a two-minute walk through Elements to the MTR station with a connection directly to the airport. It costs virtually nothing to catch the train to the airport too. And since you need to check your baggage two hours before your flight, you can just hop down (or have a bellman guide you and your bags) to the station, buy a ticket for the train, and check into your airline with your bags. Then you can go up and grab a bite to eat or go to this great Japanese bakery right near the MTR entrance, and then go back later to take the train to the airport.

Price to move from Wonderful to Fabulous was HKD 200, which is approximately USD25 per night, before tax and service charge. Slept very well though.. the mattress was firm enough, pillow was a little flat but made it up by stacking 3 beneath my head. Used the gym during this stay, great equipment but not a very big one. 5 treadmills were all in use during peak hours... Xbox Kinect installed... good feature to have but wonder how many guests actually use it... state of art equipment by TechoGym,, great stuff! Given the space constraint at the reception area, 5 persons in the line makes the reception look crowded, saw staff speaking with those in line waiting to check out, if they have no incidental bills and room rates to settle, they can leave the hotel without seeing the cashier. Thats one way to cut the waiting time. So an improvement there. Despite all the great hardware, I somehow did not manage to identify any outstanding staff offering that warm and hospitable service.... no one went beyond that \"hello\" \"good morning\" and welcome back\"... am i asking for too much? or are they jaded with all the Chinese visitors from Motherland?", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "HCMC", "Title": "\u201cunique, refreshing\u201d", "Author": "bmsaigon", "ReviewID": "UR124802105", "Content": "I stay at many hotels throughout the year but in HK I do enjoy the W as it is a bit unique.

As a point of comparison, I've stayed at the Sheraton in TST, JW Marriott in Admiralty, Marriott in TST, L Hotel in Causeway Bay, and Landmark Mandarin Oriental in Central. I love this hotel for several reasons: (1) First and foremost, the location is PRIME. It's conveniently located directly above the Airport Express station in Kowloon so it makes it even easier to get in and out of Hong Kong. On your check-out day, you can check out of the hotel and go downstairs to check in for your flight along with your luggage. This frees you up to travel around the city without worrying about carrying your luggage and having to get to the airport earlier to check your bags. (2) The rooftop pool is great (on a good day). It's on the 70-something floor and overlooks the harbor so the views are amazing. Unfortunately, there are often days where the fog rolls in and obstructs the view. I also wish there were hotter chicks consistently in the pool (but hey you can't win them all). (3) It's located within the Elements Mall, which I believe is the nicest in HK. It has every luxury goods shop that one can hope for (though admittedly these are everywhere in HK). The location makes it easy to drop off bags if you end up buying too much. (4) It's also a short cab ride (five minutes) or one stop on the MTR (train) into Central. I prefer the cab ride because I'm lazy (if you couldn't tell from my descriptions above). The hotel is right in front of the Western Tunnel, which is more expensive to travel through than the Cross Harbour tunnel but it saves you at least 15 minutes. (which is more expensive) I've never had a bad experience at this hotel. Food leaves something to be desired but that problem is easily overcome since you should really be out trying the HK restaurants anyway.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scranton, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel\u201d", "Author": "birdspotter13", "ReviewID": "UR124677163", "Content": "The W in Hong Kong is so attractive, with a young, energetic staff that was very helpful.

Maybe it's would-be hipster vibe, the club music, or the crazy light display, but the reception desk can be a little snobby when you check in.

The bathroom is also very large with a separate rainforest shower and huge tub (and a tv screen). It's also very quiet--no hallway noise, etc. The gym is excellent and has even better views of the harbour and Hong Kong island. There's a wide selection of weight machines, treadmills, elliptical machines, etc. Fresh towels and ice-cold water plus very good a/c. The rooftop pool is worthwhile, too, although it gets quite busy and somewhat scene-y on the weekends with people to-ing and fro-ng. I did not try any of the bars or restaurants as HK has an excellent variety for far less cost. The hotel is located in West Kowloon, right above a swank shopping mall and an MTR (subway) station so it's well positioned--especially from the airport (takes about 15 minutes on the express train). There are many decent restaurants and coffee shops in the mall plus a cinema that shows current films.

Arrived at HKIA at night, hopped up the airport express which brought us straight to Kowloon station. This station is connected to a mall and easy instructions lead us to the W Hong Kong. Can't help but to admire the cool lift which brought us to the lobby upstairs. The check in process was fast & friendly. The lift lobby on the guest floors looks just as interesting as the rest of the hotel, but wait - we've not even seen our room yet. Must have already taken at least 30-40 photos during the short trip from the entrance to the guest lift lobby. Of course, our camera would be really busy capturing images of the interesting deco once we get into our room. The room size is comfortable and larger that the usual Hong Kong sized rooms. A full size bed with other full sized furniture ensured comfort. No bumping on furniture or squeezing around the room. This is a proper sized room. The mattress was very comfortable & the pillows were just right. There were a few preset lighting modes which you could pick depending on the time of the day or on your mood. Large TV, iPod/iPhone dock, DVD/CD player - take your pick. You'll also find a CD with some cool music should you not have any cool music in your iPod/iPhone. It was really fantastic to have Adele on while enjoying the view from the comfort of the room. The bathroom is also a proper sized one, with a separate shower & bathtub. Toiletries were well stocked, large clean white towels, comfortable slippers that were well padded. Room was clean, sheets crisp, so far, very happy with the room. Then, there's the view. Looking out the large window, we got a great view of part of the harbour (Western part of HK Island) and a great view of the mighty ICC building. Although not a full harbour view, it was nevertheless a breathtaking sight. Funky, cool, sophisticated, understated, young, trendy, lively, colourful, friendly, awesome, filled with energy... some words I'd use to describe the W. In all my previous trips to HK, I've stayed at TST (Sheraton & Kowloon Hotel) so this time, we seemed a little further from the action. However, a quick shuttle ride on the complimentary W shuttle (Toyota Alphard) gets you in the heart of the action in less than 10 minutes. Don't forget, there's the Kowloon station right under the W, which gets you over to HK island in a flash. I'd say the location was more convenient that I thought. You can grab all you need at the mall below the W, with a large supermarket there where you can grab quick snacks, drinks, wine & more. It's HK, so shops open late. You'll be spoilt for choice with the number of restaurants there too, but since we were in HK, we were not going to just stay in the mall. Off to the streets of HK we went. I've always felt safe in HK and absolutely love the energy of the city. Went up to the pool in the morning, which is situated on the roof of this tall tower. Of course, the much taller ICC continues to be a majestic sight from the pool level, but from this level, the view of Kowloon & HK island was something else. There is a little store at the ground level of the W which sells cool Chinese art, sculptures and souvenirs. Guests are given a little discount and purchases are sent to the guests room directly. Fantastic items, fantastic service. The only problem I had was the fact that the holiday had to end. The weather was perfect all the days we were there except for the day when we were leaving - it rained. However, with the Kowloon station being just downstairs, we checked in our bags at the Airport Express flight check in and got our boarding passes there too. Hopped up the train and we were back at the airport. Rain? What rain? I would highly recommend the W Hong Kong to everyone. The W experience is really something else and I would stay at the W Hong Kong again without a doubt.

The details of the hotel Location: It is very near to the Hong Kong Ferry terminal. Also below the Hotel there is a metro station which is easily accessible all around the Hong Kong. Even the Metro station have all the airlines Check In counters which is the Excellent part of it. The ticket to Airport costs only HKD 18 per person. It also have a big Mall Elements below the hotel which have all the big brands. Also you can go to the Club & bar at the 118th Floor of Ritz Carlton hotel which is again can be accessed from, inside the hotel. The Location is one of the best as it is easily accessible through metro & road. Room: We took a Fantastic Suite room. The room size is bit small but the view from the room was simply too good. It was Full Harbor View room. The best thing which i liked was the accessories tray in the room which was equipped with everything, even the condoms also..:p The Bathroom is quite nice with two basins. The bed was quite comfortable & cosy. You can open the curtains from your bedside only. They are electronic one. They also put the baby cot in our room for the little baby. Also they put a welcome gift for my baby. All together it was a V good room. Breakfast: We tried the Breakfast area on our last day & mind you it was an awesome setting. Service was v. good & you will find all the options in one of the best setting you had anytime saw. Staff was quick to respond. You have a free wi fi connection at the Lobby area which was again a Good part. If it wuld have been free in the rooms as well it would have been awesome. Concierge: The Concierge is bang on target knowing there job very well. Altogether a must must recommendation to this hotel.

The hotel is 5 minutes away from Kowloon Station; which in turn is 5 minutes away from Hong Kong Station. It's a great alternative to staying in Central where comparable hotel rooms (Shangri-La, Grand Hyatt, Conrad, Four Seasons, Mandarin) are smaller, older and more expensive. If you want to be closer to TST (Tsim Sha Tsui - Kowloon's main shopping & entertainment district), you're better off staying at the Peninsula (expensive), Sheraton (moderate), Intercontinental (moderate) or the Marco Polo brand hotels (inexpensive). These hotels are within walking distance of TST / Star Ferry landing while you will need to take a cab from the W. The Elements Mall is great for business travelers who plan to stay only a few days and want to avoid touristy places like TST. It is a high end mall with lots of nice shops and restaurants. It also has a movie theater, supermarket and ice rink if you're looking for further diversion. Besides being close to Central, the next best thing about this hotel's location is its proximity to the airport. I've gotten off the plane and into my hotel room in less than 45 minutes. The rooms at the W are modern and sleek like most new W hotels around the world. It's comparable to the new W in Taipei if you are familiar with that property. Everything works well inside the room and everything is where you'd expect them to be. Most of all, it's clean. My favorite features are the rainfall showers, the extremely fast wireless broadband and the intelligent lighting. The floor to ceiling glass windows make the room look bigger and brighter; especially if you are lucky enough to get one of the rooms facing Hong Kong Harbor. I've stayed at this property at least 15 times in the past 3 years and the best rooms are corner rooms facing the harbor. You get windows on two sides of the room as well as a great view at night. Hotel amenities are good to great. The check-in procedure is usually smooth, but you maybe out of luck if you try to check in before 3pm. Since the ICC Tower was built, hotel traffic has increased and with all these Starwood Preferred Guests asking for late check out these days, you maybe asked to wait until after 3pm to check into your room. They'll usually buy you a drink at the lobby bar while you wait, but it's a minor hassle if you just flew in and are tired. The pool is fantastic for either exercise or lounging. It's the second highest pool I've ever swam in after the Ritz Carlton pool next door atop the ICC Tower (118th floor). The W pool is outdoors on the 76th floor which is usually fine as long as you avoid winters and typhoons. The hotel rents the pool deck out for parties and photo shoots so you could be swimming while there's a runway show going on - only in Hong Kong. The gym, located on the 73rd floor, is more than adequate for hotel guests on short stays. It has all the exercise machines you require as well as a great view. I've never eaten at the hotel restaurants since there are so many great places to eat inside Elements. I usually dine there or order room service which is good to very good. The lounge bar is always crowded at nights. The vibrant decor and hip music make it a great place to unwind after work or for a night cap after an evening out. The hotel staff is young, but surprisingly courteous. The W attracts a hip / trendy clientele so they hire staff to match. I've never had service issues at the hotel except maybe at the concierge. They weren't bad, maybe not as talented as those at other HK hotels such as the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton. The staff, in general, is accommodating and does try to make your stay as pleasant as possible. From a cost / performance perspective, you'd be hard pressed to find a better value. My tips for this hotel: (1) Ask for a corner room facing the harbor if possible (2) Specify early check-in if you plan to arrive before 3pm and want to use your room right way (3) You can find the cheapest rates on Starwood's website. You can find great deals if your dates are fixed and you pre-pay.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amazonas", "Title": "\u201cA perfect stay in Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "mmmotta", "ReviewID": "UR123420409", "Content": "The hotel is just amazing.

Now, wouldn't it be NICE if W can consider creating a room for younger kids to have fun, a mini indoor playground next to the gym so that parents can work out while watching through the glass to see their kids having fun in the other room?!? This is my Wish and hope the next time I visit again, this Wish can be REALIZED?!?

However, you feel isolated as the hotel is not within walking distance of anywhere (unless you fancy an uninspiring walk in through a mega construction site). And the MTR connection is only good for taking you into Central. Having said that, the W is a pretty new hotel, with great views of the harbour and a great party scene. The pool on the 76th floor is great, although we were unlucky to be in HK during the tail end of a typhoon... With regards to the rooms and service, as other people commented, you might as well be in Mexico City, London or Santiago, this is still your same W standard, for good or ill. As SPG Platinum, we got upgraded to a big corner room, which featured a nice bathtub with great views, and complete with its own TV. All type of gadgetry is also available, including iPhone docks, etc. Note that the hotel is flanked by the enormous XXX tower and an extremely tall apartment block, so even the highest floors will have their harbour views partially obstructed. Other than that, it's worth noting that there are always taxis outside, there is a very convenient supermarket in the mall for supplies (as breakfast has never been the strong point of any W), and that the restaurant on the ground floor has what seems like a great Sunday brunch dim-sum all you can eat deal, but it finishes really early (like 10 or 11am) so we missed it. Concierge is hit or miss, as in most hotels. On our previous trip to HK we randomly walked in to check out the hotel and asked the concierge for some tips in the area, and despite knowing we weren't guests, he gladly recommended and booked a few meals for us. This time, we got the classic automatic: \"what type of food do you like?\" questions and then got recommended some very obvious tourist spots.

Overall our experience was very good and on a scale of 1 to 10 we give it an 8. Positives first. Location is great being right on top of Kowloon Station which also has a direct airport link check-in. It is also attached to the Elements Shopping Centre which has plenty of designer boutiques which don\u2019t get as crowded as Harbour City. There are also dozens of restaurants and cafes in Elements. W has two restaurants: Kitchen and Sing Yin. Kitchen is the main restaurant for breakfast and has a buffet for lunch and dinner. The breakfast buffet is definitely one of the best we have experienced anywhere - wide variety of both Asian and Western foods and they have new items each day. The Western food selection at breakfast is surprisingly good for an Asian country. The lunch and dinner buffets are quite good as well (but not great). Sing Yin is their Chinese restaurant - the food and decor is exceptional. The room and lobby design is very hip. The lift lobby on each floor looks like a library and you get free wifi in the restaurant and ground floor lobby. The rooms have an open design and floor to ceiling glass gives you a great view across the city. The showers are very good, you actually get an overhead rain shower as well as a wall mounted one and you can turn them both on at the same time. The swimming pool is on the 76th floor. It\u2019s worth going up there just for the sweeping views of the city. If you don\u2019t want to swim you can jump in the spa. Now for negatives. The lighting in the bathroom is inadequate and there is insufficient space on the vanity bench to place your things when you are trying to do your make up. The bathroom seems to stay wet for a very long time and can have a musky smell. The towels are excessively bleached. Probably our biggest gripe was the lack of wardrobe and cupboard space to unpack. We could only hang up a few items and then we had to leave most of our clothing in our suitcases. So overall, we were very happy to have chosen this hotel in Hong Kong.

That said, our stay here was \u201cfine\u201d if relatively unremarkable. Probably the most worthwhile element to discuss is the location. As others have said, the hotel is conveniently located attached to the Elements Mall that is atop the Kowloon MTR and Airport Express stops. We frequently took advantage of this top to zip over to Hong Kong island and could easily utilize the Airport Express \u201cIn-town check-in\u201d desks at the Airport Express stop to check our baggage up to 90 minutes prior to departure (Something has to be said that HK can have multiple facilities to check baggage like that ~25 km from the airport without hassle when many North American airports seem to struggle to do so an hour before\u2026). And yes, the hotel is right along the water in Kowloon. But don\u2019t get to excited about the accessibility of where the hotel is situated. The mall complex it is attached to might as well be on the moon to some extent \u2013 the entire site is bordered either by water or the vast construction site of the coming high speed rail to the mainland and additional development. Walking even to TST (a more convenient subway station), elsewhere in Kowloon, or the Kowloon ferry terminal is possible but requires navigating an unclear cavalcade of roadside construction cones that represent sidewalks. The direct subway line the hotel/mall is on will cross you to Hong Kong station in central, but going elsewhere on HK island will require a in-network walk to Central station. But back to the actual hotel\u2026.It was fine. The bedding and the complementary Bliss toiletries were the same great W standards you\u2019d expect from Doha to Santiago to Montreal. As a Platinum member, I was \u201cupgraded\u201d to a slightly better view room of the harbor. The room was clean and spacious enough but nothing to write home about.

We did not check out either of the hotel restaurants or the lobby bar as nothing really caught our attention and feel there are a lot more interesting selections in this city.

I think you should definitely use the shuttle service! The Kitchen restaurant was also fantastic, I don't recommend the dinner buffet there but there are various types of a la carte available. I had a teriyaki salmon fillet and rib-eye steak and I absolutely loved them! Moreover, you should try the breakfast as well. it's 230hkd per person plus 10% service charge but I can tell you that it is worth the money. There are tons of fresh baked breads, it just feels so good to start the day with a good breakfast.

I stayed at 6 different 5 star hotels over just 13 days, and W Hotel Hong Kong was by FaR the best!! So modern and funky! Amazing, and I mean AmAZiNG service!!! We paid for the fabolus room and paid extra for breakfast each morning. The breakfast was SO good!! There's a wall full of freshly squeezed juices (Inc Guava), and smoothies. The spread of food was extensive to say the least! This was also the last place I could get a decent cappuccino before heading to China. I am shocked this hotel isn't ranking number 1?? It's in an amazing location, next door to the ICC building (one of the worlds tallest super skyscrapers which has the worlds tallest hotel and bar \"ozone\" inside (amaZing views). Also below the ICC building is one of the best shopping centers I have ever been to! AND below this shopping centre is Kowloon train station (express to airport makes it super easy for English only speaking ppl like me). The infinity pool on the top floor was absolutely stunning. I could not believe how perfect the sights were! Infinity pool amd bar with Hk skyscrapers lining the sky as far as the eye can see in the distance!! Gorgeous!! My friend said he's been all over the world Inc new york and said these views in Hong Kong were by far the most impressive! Will DEFINITELY be back as soon as time is right and o can afford oT again. It Is not cheap but once you have been you easily justify the costs. The girlfriend will love the shopping centre (Elements) which has stores such as Hermes, YSL, versace, etc as well as more affordable fashion. For those interested in knowing what other hotels I went to after my stay in hong kong and W is by far superior, are: The other hotels we stayed in china on our stay were Shangri-La (Shenzhen, China), Sofitel (Guangzhou, China), Sheraton (Shunde, China), Crowne Plaza (Ningbo, China), Radisson Blu (Shanghai) over 13 days.

It was very obvious that this place is running down rapidly. The washroom has a large, irremovable stain mark near the toilet - a very disgusting look as if some one just pee on the cement wall. Then inside the shower, same kind of mark on the wall. The sliding door was not able to stop the water from leaking out during shower, the result - very messy and wet floor afterward. There was a flood in the shower stall on the first night after I showered for just 10 minutes. After some investigation, I had discovered that the drainage was plugged due to a massive hair ball was clogged in there - an absolutely horrifying experience for a trendy hotel charging me HK $2,500 ($300 US) a night! Then the bedroom, the curtain definitely need a wash. The writing desk (made with the same gray cement/stone as the toilet wall) had the same ugly looking stain mark as in the bathroom ... and yes, don't go the Chinese restaurant called Xin Yin (used to be a steak house) for dinner at the lobby level even when they offer you a 20% discount if you are the guest of the hotel. It was a total rip-off, I regretted very much to go there with my friends on the second night of my stay. Food was average but the price they charge me was ridicules! The positive side is, this hotel is right above the fast train station to the airport so you can check-in your luggage at the train station before taking off. The high-end shopping mall, Element, is attached to the hotel and is a great place for shoppers for brand name products. Staff at the hotel are overall very helpful.

Why the suitcase provision in the room to unpack if you can't even get a regular size Samsonite opened on it? Quite some fancy schnick schnack in terms of merchandising but this most important feature used by probably each and every guest is under-designed. I quite liked the room design but opening a coke a few drops went onto the floor. Like a good guest I got a wet cloth from the bathroom and removed the drops from the carpet realizing that there was truckloads of hair all over the floor! Disgusting! That was not the only spot where hair was to be found. The stone used all over the room is quite nice but if not treated the right way like the shower in my room this can be a counter productive feature looking dirty. Also the shower ceiling was damaged. The sound system was quite cool although the TV speaker covering textile was full of food or beverage splashes. The moveable light attached to the beds headboard made a horrible sound turning it. The TV at the bathtub could be a nice feature....provided it works! Calling my colleague to pick me up at the room resulted in a workout as you can't get on another floor without being escorted by the staff. The living room was quite poor visited despite it being a Saturday, staff here was stone cold. The rooftop bar was closed \"open only in the summer\", we had something like 25 degrees.... The SPG TV is one of the nicer features, nice information about the city but an overdose of Starwood!

The hotel was in the same building as Airport Express Kowloon Station, which made it very convenient for stopover. And if you are on business with Morgan Stanley or Deutsch Bank, W will be a good choice for you as the companies are located in the adjacent ICC building. The hotel provided shuttle service to TST, but it was only for one way. So you will have to find a taxi on your way back. I like the hotel's modern and club style design. And the biggest selling point is their rooftop swimming pool located on the 76th floor overlooking the city and part of the habour. However, sometimes it can get very windy on the roof which makes it impossible to swim. The room was big enough by Hong Kong standard, with an over-sized bathroom. I particularly like the bed as it was by far the most comfortable one in all of the hotels I stayed at. However, the room didn't seem to be well-maintained as there were scratches on some furnitures. Also, there was noticeable stains on the toilet. The ocean-view was a big disappointment. Instead of the typical view of the Victoria Harbour that you get from Sheraton, Intercontinental, or Peninsula, at W, what you will actually see is a port of shelter for a lot of small fishing boats. Upon check-in, the frontdesk staff spent 3 minutes looking for my reservation, and finally, I was told by the front desk staff that I would get a NON-SMOKING room that I requested. But when I got to the room, it was filled with strong smoke smell. I called and complained and the answer I got was:\" Oh of course sir, your room was on A smoking floor!\" Other than that, most of the staffs I met were friendly and helpful. When I was waiting for the hotel shuttle in the lobby, a young female concierge staff came to me and we had a very good conversation. W Hong Kong will still be one of my many choices when I visit Hong Kong in the future. Overall, I think it is a good hotel but the inconsistency in service keeps it from being one of the top class hotels in Hong Kong. If you have the budget for W, you might as well spend a bit more for Mandarin Oriental or Peninsula, which I think will be a much safer bet.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cA great introduction to the W brand.\u201d", "Author": "ramblinAmerican", "ReviewID": "UR118850683", "Content": "The W hotel in Kowloon was incredibly impressive.

Also, it fills up quickly, as there aren't a lot of lounge chairs. This hotel is attached to a mall, which is full of great shopping and really good restaurants.

There's simply too much going on everywhere you look. The design concepts are completely disconnected and it's a shame because some of the elements are rather interesting. Reception was very friendly and efficient. The hallway to the guest rooms was great and had a sort of Alice in Wonderland feel, kitted out like a private library shelved with various books and personal items all sculpted in white. (Good luck finding the elevator call button which is hidden in the design.) The room was spacious and fairly cool with sliding walls that could be moved around for heightened bathroom privacy. The bathroom was large with separate bath, shower and toilet areas. Like the rest of the hotel, there was a bit too much going on in the room design-wise, but it was nowhere near as disjointed as the public spaces. The room had a nice view of the harbor, but don't expect the the postcard picture; this hotel is nowhere near the iconic waterfront of Hong Kong. In fact it's not near very much you'll want to see as a tourist (except the rather outstanding mall that it's attached to) but it's only about a twenty minute walk to the ferry. The rooftop pool is a highlight of this hotel. The view is mostly blocked by the neighboring buildings, as is the sun after about 1PM, but if you go early it's a great place to hang out and recharge. The giant wall mosaic is a standout design feature of the hotel and reiterates the 'down the rabbit hole' theme of the hallways.

Bathroom has separate bathtub and rain shower area. Bathtub has a tv screen which works very well. Cool stationery and amenities in the room exudes a very hip and trendy feel for the W brand. The location of the hotel atop Elements mall is great for access to the airport but it's a bit of a walk to other tourist hotspots.

Admiralty (Conrad, Upper House, Shangri-la) seems to offer the most seamless subway access to TST as well as all of HK Island.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cSo convenient\u201d", "Author": "StarrySue", "ReviewID": "UR115858098", "Content": "I will definitely stay here again, it's located right above the mall that not only houses a Starbucks (when you need consistent coffee, Starbucks in China is a life saver), but numerous shops and restaurants, as well as the train and MTR.

You don't even need a cab, air conditioning throughout, a welcome element when dealing with humidity in a metropolitan city. The train is also great if you are attending the Accessories trade show, if you're registered, your trip on the train is free (if I remember correctly). So much more convenient and faster than taking the bus. Service was fantastic, the staff (bell men, concierge, registration, gym, pool) we're all helpful and informative. The gym is very clean, tons of water bottles, so you will never be dehydrated. The pool has a great view, but I didn't stay out to relax since it was overcast and drizzly. High speed internet was fast and nothing was censored online, totally a different store when on the mainland. The iPod dock was a little confusing at first, but in 10 minutes I was listening to my own music while prepping for the work day. Rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are nice.

The gym was staffed every now again - staff were however too busy playing on the xbox to look after guests. The breakfast buffet at Kitchen looks fantastic - unfortunately the food quality on quite a number of items was not great and the service mediocre at best. My orange juice twice turned out to be pineapple juice, waiting to sign the bill every morning was very annoying and most pastries and breads were very dry and not fresh. The pool on the top floor is very impressive, great loungers, cool infinity pool with fantasic views - unfortunately the usually great W pool ingredients of music, beverage service etc were missing. Though there were plenty of staff they were too busy chatting with each other to notice guests. To me the most disappointing aspect of all was that at 12.30 at night the bar staff would go around and asked everyone for last orders. At 1 in the morning, the bar pretty packed lights are turned on as brightly as possible, the music gets switched off and the drinks at the bar get covered by purple towels. My colleague and I watched in amazement as group after group of potential guests got turned away from about 12.15 onwards - once again service is very slow as staff are too busy chatting.

The pool staff were less in number but twice as useful and they now have a pool bar - we had dinner there twice and numerous drinks - so thanks for fixing that issue! Room was great, as usual beds were extremely comfortable, large bathroom and lots of little gadgets. The staff did a terrific job cleaning and turning down the room everyday. My grandmother used the car service which was efficient but driver not friendly. I used gym everyday, it has great views and great equipment and the staff were very friendly. Check -in and check out was easy, we tried to join SPG but they wouldnt give points for the accommodation which was a shame. As mentioned we ate and drank regularly at the pool which is a superb location. Food was good (the portion of some of the snacks was a bit small for the price). We ate at the new cantonese restaurant and it was great dim sum - up there with the best in HK. Had drinks again at the living room, terrific service. Drinks were good but inconsistent when the bartenders changed. Didnt use Bliss Spa as I have had numerous problems with them in the past not honouring promotional offers and have found the desk staff there to be rude and unprofessional.

The view from my room was overlooking the West Harbor Tunnel and West Kowloon shipping yard. The view was not overly spectacular but you can see across to central on HK Island. I'm told the night view is amazing, but it was overcast during my trip and I wasn't able to see much. Location: The hotel is located right next to Elements, one of Hong Kong's big shopping malls. It's only a short taxi ride to Tsimshatsui or the Star Ferry for access to Central. The W is a good choice for those that don't want to stay on HK Island or those that want to try the developing West Kowloon area for something different. Restaurants: (breakfast) Breakfast at the Kitchen was up to the usual high standard of other W hotels with a HK flavor. You get to enjoy a nice view of West Kowloon as you sip your coffee. I heard from one of the other guests that there is a good Cantonese restaurant called Sing Yin. I'm going to try it on my next trip. Pool: I took a trip up to the 76th floor to check out the pool. It's one of the highest rooftop pools in the world offering spectacular views across the city. Liked: Extra friendly service from many staff members, easy access from the airport and the beautiful swimming pool (just wish next time I'm not struck down with flu and can actually take a swim). Disliked: I've heard others complain on Tripadvisor about the showers. They seem to leak causing water to trip into the toilet and bathroom floor. Although not a major issue for me it might annoy some guests. Room Tip: Rooms facing the harbor are best on higher floors. Summary: The W Hotel HK met and exceeded my expectations. It's very convenient, staff are full of energy and friendly and the rooms are a good size and in excellent condition. I'll stay again and next time bring my wife for a swim on the 76th floor.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California, U.S.", "Title": "\u201crelatively new hotel with excellent service but so-so location\u201d", "Author": "whoisthis", "ReviewID": "UR110657833", "Content": "We stayed at the W for 3 nights in May. The customer service was great. When the check-in/check-out got too long, more staff came and open up more lines. We called housekeeping a couple of times and they showed up within 5 minutes. We got a Fabulous Room with ocean view. The room has a great rainshower with good water pressure, there is a tv by the bathtub, and we like the mood lighting in the room. There is a decent size flat screen built into the bedroom wall, along with floor-to-ceiling window with electric shades. The room also has heavy soundproofing so we couldn't hear our neighbors or doors slamming outside. It came with the usual amenities and we have no complaints. As to the location, it's located above the Kowloon MTR station, which is one of the stop for the Airport Express, which means you can get here from the airport without stepping foot outside. You can also check in your bags at the subway station. Other reviewers have noted that it's convenient because of this, but I would note that the Kowloon station subway is the Disneyland subway line, and this is important for two reasons. One is that the frequency of the train is a lot less than other subway lines, so instead of the usual less than 2 minutes per train, it's about 7 minutes or so per train. I know this may not matter for most people. Second, while it's convenient to get to the hong kong side (only one stop to Hong Kong station), it doesn't have any stop on the Kowloon side. So if you want to get to Tsim Sa Tsui or Mongkok, you will have to take a taxi (I heard the hotel has a free shuttle but we didn't use it). There is nothing around the hotel other than the Elements Mall located underneath it, although the mall does have restaurants should hunger strikes. As for internet, the hotel charges a fee for in-room wifi or wired connection. I think it's USD $20 per day, or you can buy per hour. There is free wifi in the lobby if you bring your laptop downstairs. I believe the business center let you use their pc for a time limit without charge (I think it's 30 minutes). Other than the location issue, this is a good hotel to stay in Hong Kong. It's in a up-and-coming area and I imagine there will be more things to do around the area in the near future.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cThe amazing Whatever/Whenever Experience you have to try!\u201d", "Author": "MarvinHo", "ReviewID": "UR110111072", "Content": "I was indeed looking forward to experience the \"W\"hatever, \"W\"henever experience and it had indeed overwhelmed me and exceed my expectations!

From the moment you step into the hotel entry on the ground, to the reception on the 6, and to 25th floor where I was staying, it was a \"wow\" experience. The elavator lobby especially thrilled us. And we are not easily thrilled. And the room had more electrical outlets that any other I have seen. I counted at least 14 outlets strategically placed at the bedsides (2 each side), the desk (4), the TV, the coffee table, safe, the walls, etc. Most impressive. The staff were absolutely helpful and down-to-earth, ie warm, From the room service staff who delivered a 3am hot-chocolate to the Dir of Ops (James W). James actually stepped out of the elavator to listen to us. Only 2 small minus points for this property. The lack of clear signage guiding guests from the Elements Mall (downstairs, linked to the Airport Express) to the hotel. I understand from James that the hotel is working very hard to add more signage. The other negative is the location of the property on Kowloon port area.

Just like Westin's Heavenly Bed, the W Bed was extremely comfortable. The rainforest shower was also a great indulgence. It could work in conjunction with the handheld shower, not one or the other like in other hotels. One slight problem though, some water did seep through to the toilet next to the shower as both share a large sliding door. With the sliding door, you could only have either a closed toilet or a closed shower, not both. In terms of the location, because it is on the Tung Chung MTR line (on top of Kowloon Station), it will take a fair bit of walking at Hong Kong/Central station in order to reach the Island Line stations. I must also compliment the staff as they were very courteous and helpful. As I fell sick in the middle of the night, the duty manager even came out of the office to hail a taxi for me to go to the hospital.

I would of given 5 stars if it was not a couple of things we experienced. I'll list that later on because there are definitely a lot of good things to say about this hotel that out weighs my annoyances. First of all getting here from the airport is so easy and convenient. Grab your bags buy a ticket to Kowloon. Train is right there and it is super clean. Probably less than 20 minutes you are the bottom of the W Hotel. I wish NYC had something like this. I know it sucks to arrive at JFK and if you take the air train to Jamaica and then transfer to the E train to get into the city. It could take you close to an hour and half. So we check in and the reception area is very nice. The staff there are extremely friendly and just like the hotel very trendy. Same goes for the concierge. We spoke to Patrick and he took the time to tell us all the good places to eat and how to get there. The 6th floor reception area is the only area you can get free wi-fi unless you pay for it. You can sometimes pick up their signal downstairs in the lobby as well. They gave us room 1616. Knowing the W hotel goes up like 70+ floors I was hoping to get a room on a higher floor. No worries it still was a very nice room with a nice view of Hong Kong and the Harbor. Their beds and sheets were extremely comfortable! I had such a good night sleep while staying here. I need to get their pillow and comfortable. The room is a typical W Hotel. Very trendy with many nice features. Like a control panel near the bed to control the blinds and lighting. The TV was behind the mirror and the bar was nicely built into the table. The bar on the 6th floor is definitely happening place. The nights we were there it was packed. They play some really good music as well. The use of their gym was great as it was 24 hours. Located on the upper floors you get some nice views. Kenneth was on hand the day I went and he offered some nice training tips. Extremely friendly. The pool on the roof has some amazing views and it is heated. It is a bit windy up there when we went. I don't see this being a factor once summer kicks in. The W Hotel is located inside a very nice shopping area. Almost all the stores are high end. They even have an ice rink downstairs. There were also a lot of places to eat inside if you didn't want to travel. Their noodle restaurant seems to especially popular. Probably because of the cost. Fairwood's downstairs was your best bang for your buck. So my only minor annoyances with our stay our room constantly flooded or leaked water from the shower. I was surprised they didn't offer to move us to a new room. You can actually see the water line from the constantly flooding. We just learned to point the shower head away from the sliding door. Seems more like a design flaw if you ask me. Secondly, we made coffee in the mornings. Every time we came back to our room. Everything was cleaned and put away except for the coffee put. I am not sure why they don't clean the coffee pot. They even replaced our coffee cups so they must of know we used the coffee pot. Third, the location of the W hotel is a bit inconvenient if you wanted to go to Mong Kok, Jordan or Tsim Sha Tsui. Even those these area was right next to Kowloon. The MTR lines goes around these areas. This is very minor as the W has a free shuttle service. This is not a typical shuttle. We got an nice Audi Q7 with a driver to take us over to this area. Nice touch by the W. Lastly, and this is no fault of the W. If you come down and visit the shopping area. You are going to be constantly bombarded by these young sales guys trying to sell you something. I believe it was condos or apartments. It gets kind of annoying pretty quickly. Just say no thank you and they will leave you alone. We never got a dirty look. Overall I loved my stay here and in Hong Kong.

I chose the hotel because I generally enjoy W Hotels and due to the easy public transportation to Central Hong Kong. The rooms here are very nice. They are large by Hong Kong standards, with a comfortable work area, large bathroom, and a very comfortable bed. It was easy to get a good night's rest here. The room contained a good minibar selection, an iron, safe, bathtub, separate shower, and a lounge sofa near the windows. Also, it had great blackout curtains that made sleeping easy and also had good light settings that were preset depending on the time of day. Overall the rooms are great at this hotel. The facilities are quite nice also. The pool area is a bit small, but that's to be expected at 76 stories in the air. It had a good vibe to it. I also used the bliss spa for a massage and thought it was average - the massage was nice, but I didn't feel that the overall service was that great. Just a bit impersonal for my tastes. I ate a couple of times at the \"Kitchen\" restaurant - both the breakfast and dinner buffets. I felt that the restaurant was a disappointment- both times I felt unwelcome as a solo business traveler, and as if I were inconveniencing the staff simply by wanting to eat there. The breakfast buffet was completely empty with about 15 minutes before the cut-off time. I would suggest avoiding \"Kitchen\" and eating elsewhere. It was the low of my stay here. With that said, the hotel is in a huge mall with tons of shopping and eating options. It's also directly above a subway link into Central and to the airport. This somewhat makes up for the out-of-the-way location in a huge construction zone that's about a 20 minute walk from central Kowloon. I also stayed at the Sheraton during this trip. I like both hotels quite a bit. The rooms at the W are much nicer, and the commute to Central is a little easier at the W. The W also has a better bar and pool scene, so it's more fun to hang out at. The Sheraton on the other hand has better restaurants in my opinion, and a better location because it's in the center of the Kowloon action.

The only kind of establishment that can help in this case is one of Hong Kong's many 4 or 5 star hotels. Of course those hotels come with an equally 5 star rate, especially in Hong Kong, so we took a long time reading reviews here and looking at many, many, many websites for prices. After some hours, we got to the W. Known for being uber-trendy and, according to some, a little dark, we were especially charmed by the fact that it's right at Hong Kong's new premier mall, Elements (shoppy shoppy shopping!) and therefore at Kowloon station, the second stop of the airline express train and MTR stop. Super handy for a short stay! If you're around longer, you might want to stay more towards Tsim Sha Tsui or Hong Kong Island. The hotel itself: when we walked in, we could only think of one of the words the W group love to use themselves: fabulous! Amazing detail to modern design, a hotel bar looking more like a lounge you'd actually enjoy visiting on a night out (good DJ and fab cocktails), and the smell...W could you please start selling that room scent you use, I seriously need this for my house! And then the room...a lot of people here mention they were in one of the higher ranked rooms...well we decided the splurge was big enough to stay in the standard one. But, seriously, we were more than pleased! Now personally I'm not very much into grey interiors, but this room was done really nicely, the bathroom was good, the Bliss products a real treat, and the bed was everything you'd expect from the whole group of hotels - perfect. Hadn't slept so well during our whole holiday. What's more, we had a pretty good view of Hong Kong Island, at least as good as it gets considering there are a couple of apartment and office buildings blocking some of the view - but good enough! Try asking for room 2520, which was our room. Apart from the room, the rooftop heated swimming pool and gym are also good fun, even in winter! Drawbacks? Hard to imagine, but I have a couple, just to be complete(ly honest): - breakfast is never, ever, worth 25 Euros (sorry I cannot remember the exact amount in HKD). However wonderful it is, you already pay a lot to stay at the hotel, and with Hong Kong's food being of high quality, and found throughout the city (including the Elements mall) for good quality at a mere fraction of the cost, you are cheating yourself to pay such a price. If I had one suggestion to make to the hotel, I do believe they'd also gain more out of their breakfast service by slashing it by a couple of EUR/USD/HKD. - however pretty the view was, the windows were very dirty. I know it's hard to maintain such a building and acknowledge the hotel did inform about a refurbishment going on, but we did find it a little disappointing to find our windows having a pretty visible layer of dirt on them. Now I am from Hong Kong originally so I've seen the island many times, but I can imagine that someone who's on their first visit could find this a major let down. Last but not least - this hotel is great for us and for like-minded people, but, as all W hotels, I would not recommend this to couples who prefer classic looking hotels, people who dislike (dark coloured) modern design, and young families. This IS the place for couples who enjoy design, groups of friends on a hip getaway to HK and business travellers.

But W Hong Kong really wowed me and exceeded my expectations. 1. Location, Location and Location The location is great! The MTR is located in the Elements shopping mall which is just besides the hotel. The MTR has a direct train service to the airport. The ride is less than 25 mins and costs about HKD90 per trip. And the MTR station has the down-town check-in counters for major airlines. You save the hassle of towing your luggages up the trains. You can check in your luggages and go shopping at the Elements shopping mall before heading to the airport. 2. Transport W Hong Kong is one station away from all the action in Hong Kong. The hotel also provides complimentary shuttle service between the hotel and Tsim Sha Tsui. 3. The room As usual, the room is well stocked with Bliss toiletries. Unlike the W's in New York and Barcelona, this W has a bath tub in addition to a shower area. There is a small TV screen at the end of the bath tub. You can take a bath and watch TV at the same time. The room is big by Hong Kong standard. In fact, I invited some of my friends to the room for a drink. The bed is comfy and the hotel provides turn down service. 4. The restaurants We tried the new chinese restaurant, Sing Yin. The food was good but the price is on the high side even after the 20% discount given to W hotel guests. You can get better food at a cheaper price if you venture outside the hotel. If you don't fancy hotel breakfast, there are a number of cafes and restaurants in the shopping mall located just besides the hotel. 5. The Gym, pool and other facilities I'm really impressed with the gym and pool. The gym is well equipped. The pool at the 76th floor overlooks the habour, excellent view especially in the night (however, it's partially blocked by two residential blocks). There is also a hot jacuzzi pool just besides the main pool. The separate men and women steam/ sauna and jacuzzi on the 73th floor is very much appreciated. Although it's rather weird to see female attendant walking into the men's dressing room occasionally to clean up the dressing room and stock up the towels. 6. Business Centre We wanted to print the boarding pass but the business centre was closed. I wish they had a 24 hour business centre where guests can print out their boarding passes (just like the one in W Barcelona). 7. Staff The service was impeccable and the staff did not disappoint us. They were so much friendlier than those in New York, and the Hong Kong went the extra mile just to accomodate our needs. The excellent service also extends to the Sing Yin restaurant.

I love HK and visit frequently. I've made it a habit to try a new hotel with each visit, having done the top end Mandarin and 4S, as well as a few funkier hotels like the W and ideally located though more down market LKF. If you've been to other W hotels worldwide, you already know the story, you get the brand. They're mid high end range, though focus on the cool factor that other upper high ends seem to eschew in favour of more sublte elegance. Wacky, Wild, Wonderful, Whimsical, whatever.... I actually tire of the 'W' thing pretty quickly. The positives are easy to identify here, service is very good, the look and feel of the interior is sleek and modern, all the furnishings are new, the rooftop pool is way beyond awesome and, having booked a corner room, I especially enjoyed standing naked in the shower, a couple of hundred feet up, facing across to HK Harbour and singing to Christina Aguilera's 'Beautiful' piped through the speakers in my bathroom to shower room conversion space, thing. But that's just me. Oh, I was joking about Christina, though, and it pains me to admit it, it's kinda a decent song. The location is good, but not central - it's in the Kowloon Union Square area near the massive ICC. Kowloon is to Hong Kong what Brooklyn is to Manhattan - though not quite as cool as Brooklyn. It's easy enough to hop on the tube to IFC and onwards, or to take a cab through the tunnel (under HK Harbour) and right into the City, and the connection to the airport is fantastic, but you can't just walk out the door and step into the hustle and bustle, which is something I always enjoy from a City hotel. A few other notes - room service brought up the wrong Champagne twice (we still drank it...), and they ran out of Moet Rose by the 4th or 5th bottle, which seems unreasonable for a large hotel (it wasn't just me drinking...). Check in and out wasn't as fast as I'd like it to be, though by no means slow. The spa was WWWonderful - there I said it - though the Gym only average. Overall, why the 4 stars for the W Kowloon, a hotel I would gladly stay at again? Well, the reason I go to the W is for the vibe, for the scene - I want to step into the lobby and feel the excitement. The W Kowloon lacks that thrill;; the bar closes early and the evening scene for pre-party drinks was quite subdued. It's fine - that's not a terminal issue and there are plenty of people who really couldn't care less, but if you're used to the W in Manhattan, well Kowloon just doesn't compare. For prospective travelers, I would recommend you see if there 3 nights for the price of 2 deal is available, they do it occasionally, but I think it's more supply and demand driven rather than a regular occurrence.

We were on the 36th floor which had amazing views over the bay to central HK, the view down below is of the working docks and the roof area of the Elements shopping centre which are interesting and colourful but at night the view is amazing. But if you want an incredible view just go up to the top 71st floor where the pool and spa are surrounded by glass walls hundreds of feet up in the air! We didn't eat in the hotel as there are do many reasonable restaurants in the shopping centre below we did look at the menu and it looked good but expensive as you would expect. If you are there at a weekend there is a really fun atmosphere in the lobby/reception bar at night, its like a club where all the cool young people hang out, loud music and low lights. The rooms are beautifully designed and very clever, with sliding walls round the bathroom that you can open in the day to give more space. Fittings are all quality with plasma TV and hidden fridges and bars. Windows are floor to ceiling to make the most of the views, electric blinds were fun too. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough we are certainly W converts we look forward to visiting them elsewhere in the world. If there is one small downside to this hotel it is the location from a walking out perspective, you need to take a taxi to the ferry terminal (about \u00a33) as the road is v busy and dusty but taxi's are always waiting outside.

I selected this hotel because i had a half off coupon from starwood. Even with half off, our room was about $190 per night. Price aside, this hotel had some very positive attributes. This hotel is extremely easy to get to from the airport. you just take the train, get out and go up the escalators. This hotel is located above the train/TMZ station, in a mall. Having a mall at your doorsteps is extremely convenient (and tempting). The W is defintely trendy. Hip music plays in the lobby and music videos play in the elevators. The lobby has free internet. Rooms are spacious. We had a floor to ceiling view of the harbour. The room is extremely high tech. You have to insert your key in the wall to turn everything on. With a push of the button, the lights dim, the shades rise/close and tv clicks on/off. The room has flat screen tv and also flat screen above the tub. Rain fall shower. I didn't care for this. One negative..it would flood our bathroom. Bathroom was crammed with bliss toiletries plus some (razor and toothbrush daily). The infinity pool looks fantastic. We were there in december; not quite warm enough to use the pool but warm enough to use the infinity hot tub. I also signed up for a spa service. This is one negative. The spa waiting area was dirty. It looked like they had been very busy prior to my arrival. There were lots of dirty cups and dirty plates. The spa service was nice. I was pleased. One good thing about this hotel. They offer free shuttle service to 3 different shopping areas in kowloon.

We stayed during Xmas and therefore upgrade opportunities were limited. Depsite these constraints, James W. and Winny L. were able to accommodate us into a Fabulous room with our SPG status.

The property is pricey but the final product is commensurate with the higher cost and deserving of the various international accolades and recognition.

What surprised us also was the scheduled shuttle drop off service from W to TST (Tsim Sha Tsui) for either more shopping or the Star Ferry.

We didn't eat at the hotel - choosing instead to enjoy Hong Kong food at its best - where the locals go!!! The Star Ferry to Central and an eating fest beginning with lunch at Caprice; followed by drinks waterfront; egg tarts & king prawn wonton noodles before dinner of hot-pot and the must-do karaoke!

Checkout speed was great- they found ways to avoid the paperwork common for many hotels.

I didn't really know what to expect, it being a last minute trip to Hong Kong, and its been a few years since the last time I've been there. I got a good rate from family who gave us a starhot discount. I did some research and I read that the W is very near the Kowloon Airport Express stop, which I thought was a plus. But the reality of it, having arrived, everything was so convenient. Airport express was easy to use, and took us to Kowloon station in 20 minutes. Getting out of Kowloon Station you arrive at a mall, which later I found out was a fairly new mall called Elements. Less than a 5 minute walk inside the mall, and after asking information we were at the W. (The information maps at the malls seem to always have a actual person standing by whom you can ask information from). The W is connected to the mall, so you never really have to go outside. From the moment we enter, we just barely crossed over to W from Elements Mall, a very perky and kind young man welcome us and introduced himself to us and gets our bags from us. We feel welcome right away. You have to take an elevator to the main lobby area where you check in, and we go, and again, stepping off the elevator we are greeted from far away by a woman this time. Who then again introduces herself and takes me aside to what doesn't seem to look like the check in area, more like just a small desk behind the concierge. She gets my info, informs me the room isn't ready yet because we arrived at noon, and check in isn't till 3pm, but she will ask housekeeping to rush the cleaning. She offered for us to stay and have drinks or come back in a couple of hours. We decide to go out, and I realized this woman takes me off to the side table because the line at the main check in and check out area was already very long. Plus plus plus for W! Before our arrival to Hong Kong, I realized though the W is connected to the MTR, there is no MTR that goes straight to Tsim Sha Tsui, we'll have to go take one MTR and get off and connect to another one. Anyway, we decide to take a cab instead, and it seemed like only a 5 minutes drive we were at Tsim Sha Tsui, and it cost only HK$20. Later I realized the W has a free shuttle that goes to Tsim Sha Tsui, but its like every hour or half hour. Anyway, coming back to the hotel, my sister was called and informed by someone that she got the wrong bag at the airport. We leave after our lunch at Tsim Sha Tsui and go back to the hotel to double check and the woman was correct. We got her bag instead, and my sister's bag was left in the airport. My sister thinking that she has to get her bag at the airport and go back and bring this lady back her bag. Seeing our dilemma at the bellboy station on the ground floor where our bags were being kept while waiting for check in, the bellboys are asking what they can do to help. They offer getting our bag at the airport and bringing the mistaken bag to the lady's hotel. Really great service I tell you, we don't even have to ask and they offer already. But my sister decided to get her bag herself because she needed it right away. But we had them take the lady's bag to her hotel. We get to check in right after and our room was just a regular Wonderful room, and it was great. I'll upload the pictures here when I get a chance. For a Wonderful room, I found it exceptional already, what more the higher priced rooms. We also swam there. The pool is on the top floor with a great view. Though it was advertised that the pool is heated, it didn't feel heated. For November, Hong Kong wasn't very cold but wasn't very hot either. There is a hot tub though next to the pool and that was really relaxing, after dipping into the not so heated pool. The breakfast buffet was another amazing experience. I've seen a lot of breakfast buffets but not like this. They had individually bottled fresh fruit juices. I'm guessing homemade yogurt also individually jarred. They had fruit smoothies also in the buffet, right next to the freshly sliced fruit. They had an assortment of hot foods, Chinese dumplings, bacon, perfectly scrambled eggs soft and fluffy, and a lot more. You can have an omelet made to your liking and the first in a long long time that I've seen anyone make a perfectly cooked omelet. Not overcooked, nothing browned or burned, just pure yellow color all around. The have all kinds of breads and pastries. I'm not sure if I got a picture of this Wonderful breakfast spread, but if I didn't I should have. Then at the end of your stay, you can easily check in your baggage at the Kowloon Airport Express and roam around till you need to go to the airport. I left the Kowloon Station only about 80 minutes till my flight. I had more than enough time to get to my boarding gate. I can't wait to go back to Hong Kong and stay at the W. The service was great all around, and I'd like to say the bellyboys at the ground floor was really the best. Because each time you leave or come back, they will always say hi and welcome you and ask you how you are. Its really great cause they are always the first and last person you see coming in and out of the hotel, so they always leave a great impression.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cW is for wonderful\u201d", "Author": "timbeen", "ReviewID": "UR86637006", "Content": "The rooms were very clean and tastefully decorated.

From the moment you walk in and experience the stunning decor of the lobby, the common areas and each floor, you will truly be pleased you selected this hotel. We were really impressed with the creative design of the decor in the lobby, the bar and even up in the pool area. The rooms are very smart in the design and layout, making clever use of the space to make you feel like there is a lot of room all around you. The furnishings are all very sleek and new. The bathroom is very spacious and has beautiful stone tiling throughout. I love the shower head and the Bliss products they give you to use as amenities. Every item you could ever think off is available for your use, from the plush W slippers, thick robes and the luxurious king-sized bed to help you crash after a long trip. The room also comes with a large safe that is able to fit a laptop and all your necessary valuables. The wardrobe space is very suitable for any shopaholic. A pillow menu is also available for you to choose something to your liking, which is hard to find in many hotels these days. We were also very happy with the automated controls in the room, with multiple light settings, curtains and blinds. Everything you could think of for a comfortable stay has been thought of in the room. The gym is set up high to give you stunning views of Hong Kong harbour while you work out in the hotel's modern facilities. There are plenty of machines around, so there is no queuing. They also provide you with brand new headphones to use (and keep) if you need it. The gym is also stocked with plenty of fresh towels, bottles of water and green apples for the gym patron. Make sure you take a trip to the pool at the rooftop. Great views from the top while you cool off in the pool. Another place to worth hanging out in is the bar. A decent selection of wines and cocktails in an great setting, especially on a Saturday night. You can get all types of crowds coming in to enjoy the scene and makes for a good start to a night out. The other exceptional aspect about this hotel is the service from the staff. All members of staff exhibit a great level of professionalism and courtesy. As an example, I had asked number for a local restaurant. Instead of giving me the number, they asked if they could call the restaurant on our behalf and rearrange our booking. This was excellent since we had to change our booking time 3 times that night. There were many other times that we had made similar requests and they were eager to assist every time. The hotel is also in an ideal location, sitting right above the Kowloon airport station. So you are an easy walk from the airport train station as soon as you get off. There is also the Elements shopping mall, which is dangerous for some. The MTR station is also right below the hotel, so it is quite convenient. A hotel shuttle is also available free of charge to TST and the ferry terminal. Other free services include wifi in the lobby and hiring an ipod for the gym.

However, for visitors wanting to access Hong Kong Island, take into consideration the time and effort to do so. Consolidating feedback, here is my take: Check-in: My best friend, and companion on this trip is SPG Platinum, which is why we chose this particular STarwood property. Unfortunately, we arrived around noon and didn't have a room available. We were told one would be ready shortly and that we could enjoy the roof pool. Unfotunately, a room was not available until 4pm without any follow-up from the staff. We were offer 2 drink coupons in the lobby bar for the wait. Rooms: We were upgraded to a corner \"suite\"; but this is really just a large room with great views, albeit somewhat blocked by the financial centre building ahead. The bathroom is fantastic, and the shower room had floor to ceiling windows to the buidling across. Definitely an experience for the timid - shades are provided! However, the rooms have a distinct damp and slightly mold feeling to them. They are spotless, but because of the humidity in HKG, it never felt dry a/o crisp. Property: The pool is lovely on the roof and great for a few hours of downtime. Also, make your way up at night to see a bit of the skyline lite up. I highly recommend the breakfast buffet. It is a perfect blend of western and traditional choices. If you shoot for the brunch time, it is empty and the food is fresh. This is a great options for tourists looking to fill up and sustain most of the day. Services: The W provided a house van (free shuttle) with 3 drop off points in Kowloon (no HKG island). This is a free service (not advertised well) and only provides a drop off. I recommend using the central drop off by the Sheraton Hotel, which makes for easy access to ferries for HKG Island or to walk the main street in Kowloon. Location: The location is IDEAL to come/go to the airport and a simple walk to the Night Market, Warf, etc. DO note it is a bit removed however, and with the constant construction, you may have to be clever crossing the street. Chic style but too pricey on it's on. If you are an SPG point earner, use the combo points/pay for this property.

The bed was easily the most luxurious and comfortable bed in the world. However, just to compare against other luxury, high end hotels like the Ritz and Langham Place, I had two complaints: 1. I think a small child wired the electronics in the rooms. First our remote ran out of battery and we had to rip off the TV panel and unplug the TV to turn it off (it was late, so we called down the next day to fix the problem). I couldn't get the ipod player to work, and after an hour, I kindof did but I couldn't adjust the volume. Then whatever I did with the ipod cause the picture to not work in the bathtub TV (but the sound came on). Then at night, I finally got the volume to work after hitting all the A/V buttons, but then it got stuck on too loud and I couldn't even turn it down with the button on the actual TV set. I couldn't find plugs anywhere by the bed to plug in my computer. The curtain-opening button kept getting stuck. And all the buttons for the lights just were too complicated. By far the most technologically complex and frustrating hotel. 2. I felt the mentality at this hotel is that wealthy people stay here, and come with their wallets wide-open for non-stop plundering. Wireless was 115 HKD per day! Most hotels just have an open business center, but to check you email at the W it costs 45 HKD for the first 15 minutes. In-room breakfast was quite the racket, with things like toast costing 35 HKD (I think) and dry french toast was over 100 HKD. No in-room coffee, and coffee to purchase was not cheap. The minibar was incredibly overpriced as well, this is compared to the Ritz, which provides free fresh fruit, etc. They could try harder to provide the illusion of service, like charging for in-room OR business center internet, but not both, giving deals for spa treatments/dining, providing inexpensive/free drinks and snacks. I just thought it was odd to be paying a fortune for a hotel which has the same attitude towards services as a Best Western or Holiday Inn. There were some nice touches like free cookies in the check-in, chocolate with turn-down service, and the Bliss products. I just think they could take it one step further to retain the luxury experience. 3. We couldn't get service in the lounge area.

Ying and Yang. Filth and Sparkle. Nature and Steel. Rich and poor. From the rooftop of the Hong Kong W pool, you can sulk back in the jacuzzi, and just beyond the steam, note the massive threads that stitch this masterpiece of divergences together. Design The Hong Kong W is an ambitious stab at techno-chic extravagance. Everything sort of glows, and every expanse of wall, nook and cranny, is crammed with design statements and modernist showcocking. To be honest, I would call it over designed, but in a fun way that makes it tolerable in the short term. I can accept the abandon from the powerful statements simplicity could have made. But only just. Location The hotel is located on reclaimed land in West Kowloon in a ritzy shopping, residential, and office complex known as Elements. The nearby mall is stocked full of expensive shops and designer names. There is also a great grocery store. The Elements mall is the link to subway stations and the city in general, unless you are cabbing it. For auto pickup, there is a cab stand right out the W front door. I would rate the location as decent, but I personally prefer to stay on the other side of the harbor on Hong Kong island. One huge drawback is that it is difficult to set out on foot without walking through the entire mall area, as the court in front of the hotel is sheltered by a highway and a parking garage. Rooms The rooms are nearly without fault. The curtains are heavy, and even better, remote controlled. You can rise, press a button, and the fabric slowly rises, offering a dramatic morning view of cargo ships and outlying mountains. Believe it or not, this was my favorite feature of the hotel. The beds were quite soft. We had a great flat screen television with plenty of channels. The room was generally without fault, aside from one issue. The control panel on the night stand, which served all curtain raising, lighting, and ambiance functions, glowed like a small personal UFO. It was annoying. Bathroom The bathroom felt modern and utilitarian, but lacked function, namely in the shower. After every shower, the floor would flood. This may have been a unique feature of our individual room, but the ridge that separates the shower from the general bathroom was more of a suggestion than an actual attempt to keep water out. I have a suspicion that this issue plagues most rooms. Aside from this shortcomings, I thoroughly enjoyed taking in a man bath while enjoying the tub television. Common Areas The bar is a good place to meet up. Drinks are expensive, but that is expected at a place where rooms are $400 a night. The bar ambiance is generally well polished and slick with the feel of an upscale modern living room. There are even books and games for guests to thumb through. I did not eat at the restaurants in the hotel. They were too expensive. Hong Kong has some of the best food in the world. There is really no good reason to overpay for it. Pool Area For me, this was really the star of the Hong Kong W. After a few nights, we began to plan our evenings around a late night soak in the roof top jacuzzi. The roof of the W, about 77 stories up, offers fantastic views of Hong Kong Island and the outlying territories With the tallest building in Hong Kong, The International Commerce Center, sharing real estate with the W, the view is somewhat broken by its monolithic presence. It definitely puts Hong Kong's grandiose affinity with vertical growth into true perspective. Being 77 floors up and looking straight up at another building that seems to pierce the sky and enter orbit is oddly stimulating. All told, visiting the Hong Kong W pool area is an exercise in modern extravagance. Hotel guest or not, it is worth stopping by for. Pricing and Alternatives The Hong Kong W is an expensive hotel, expect to pay around $300 for a basic room. If you are not on a budget, then I highly recommend it. For about half the price, you can stay at the Metropark on Hong Kong Island which also has a nice rooftop pool with great views.

I'm not sure if I was in an upgraded room due to being SPG gold, but it was on a high floor and very quiet. Anyway, I only stayed here one night but am heading back before my flight home as we are travelling via Hong Kong again, and I'm really looking forward to it - that says something for someone who spends half their life in hotels (you miss home after a while, trust me!). I didn't get to check out the restaurant during the last visit, but will do this time. I can report that the room service was good, though. Dinner was quite good (had spicy pasta....) but not amazing, another occasion I ordered a Club Sandwich and although a fairly boring order, it was excellent! What was good about dinner was that the food wasn't too fatty, with steamed vegetables etc on the menu - good if you want to stay healthy on your travels, as I find many hotels just shove too much butter with everything.", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cGood choice, but you have to know what you're getting into\u201d", "Author": "MikeyR", "ReviewID": "UR80392207", "Content": "I'm frequent traveller to HK (please see other review of Intercontinental HK), and it\u2019s usually an overnight trip to HK on the way to or back from mainland China.

The W is part of the Elements mall, with an added advantage of being attached to the airport express train and the city train. Overall the hotel is what you expect from a high end W, all sleek, hip, and LOUD! Over the last few months I've stayed there 7 times. And generally I have very few complaints. The positives are; 1. The location 2. The hotel is spotlessly clean 3. The beds are very comfortable 4. The room amenities are very good The downsides 1. There's no proper lobby, which is usually a W design (flaw in my opinion) 2. The hotel is very loud, in the \"exchange' which is the small restaurant/cafe attached to the check in area on 6th floor, there's usually a happy hour, a function, etc. and you have to work your way through the throngs of people, and very loud music to get to the lifts 3. It\u2019s very pricey, everything is very pricy, even by HK standards 4.

We have just returned from HK after a 7 night stay. We were originally booked into the Langham Hotel Mongkok but moved to the W Hotel after a couple of days and wished we had booked here first. (We couldn't stand the Langham Hotel - What a dump compared to this place). We were given a Wonderful room on the 31st floor and the view was amazing. The room had the most incredible electronics with everything being controlled by the push of a switch. The bathroom was really lovely. There was a separate TV at the end of the bath so you could soak in a deep bath and watch TV. The shower was a separate one with a really cool rainshower head. Wish I had one of those at home! Everything in the room was clean and modern and it was a really good size room. It was probably three times bigger than the Langham Mongkok room - no kidding! The hotel was so spotless. We have never seen such an amazing entrance to the lifts. We had to look for the switch for the lift for a few moments as each floor as a bookcase with cool little books, clocks etc on it and it simply didn't look like a lift lobby. The actual lobby for the hotel was on the 6th floor so it was a bit confusing at first, but the staff on the ground floor were always helpful. We found the entire staff here to be super efficient and friendly. Location wise was great for us. The MTR is at the mall attached to the W and we found that really good for going to Disneyland for the day. There is a free shuttle which leaves every 30 minutes and takes you to Nathan Road. Unfortunately you need to get a taxi to get back but that was no bother. It is not walking distance to Nathan Road, but you could have if you are a lot fitter than us. We used the restaurant and room service and found these to be first class. For a cheaper option the Mall has a a number of choices. We found this great little Thai Restaurant which only cost us HKD 68 per meal. Overall I would absolutely recommend the W to anyone. If you are thinking of going to HK then please stay here. You will not be disappointed. We have stayed at a few hotels in HK but this is the best. We are going back to HK in a few months and will be staying here again.

It\u2019s more popular in America and Europe but has found it\u2019s way to Asia after the opening of W Hong Kong few years ago. Arriving I only had a very short one night transit stay in Hong Kong and decided to try out the W for convenience reason. Upon arriving at Kowloon Airport Express train station, it\u2019s just a short 5min walk thru the Elements Mall before reaching the hotel entrance. Check-in was speedy at the reception desk at the 6th floor. I was assigned a harbour view room at the 29th floor as per my reservation. The Room The room was advertised by the hotel at about 40sqm though I think it\u2019s smaller than that. Not as spacious as what I am usually used to but perfectly adequate for a short overnight stay. Two features of the room immediately apparent is the open concept bathroom and the large floor to ceiling windows with a day-bed at the side. This is a room that is very high on comfort factor. The King Bed features some of the best hotel linens I have ever slept in and provide a very good night sleep. The bathroom features a rainforest shower cubicle with great water pressure and fluffy bathrobes and towels. Bliss toiletries are provided which smell very nice and foams well. There is a 42\u201d LCD TV with a integrated KEF audio/video system. I was able to play DVD movies and my iPod on the system though at times the interface is a bit quirky. There is intelligent and intuitive mood lighting in the room. From the bedside console, one can select Day, Night or Dream and the lighting of the room adjust automatically. Most in-room amenities are intelligently hidden away in closets and drawers to give the room a very neat and tidy feel. Power plugs are conveniently located throughout the room. Wireless internet works the first time and the speed is fast. The room is very quiet too. I am not sure if it\u2019s because of good soundproofing or just that the rooms next door are not occupied. The location and Common Areas The hotel is connected to Elements Mall which sits right on top of the Kowloon Airport Express train station and the Tung Chung MRT line. This makes it very convenient as a transit hotel for short overnight stay. Check-in and luggage handling can be done at the train station counter without any hassle. The Elements Mall has a wide variety of stores and restaurants. I have to say the common areas doesn\u2019t exactly cater to my personal preference. The lighting can be a bit better as it seems to resemble a nightclub most of the time especially at night with the dark ambience and the pulsating disco-like decorative neon-lights. Even the lift features a neon-display on the floor. There are comfortable sofas and chairs all throughout the common area for lounging and well decorated with abstract art. It\u2019s all very funky, trendy and cool depends on what your taste gravitates towards. I do feel at times a bit out of place as most of the hotel patrons appears to be very young people. The hotel has several restaurants which I didn\u2019t have time to try. Service It\u2019s too short a stay to test out the hotel service. Generally, my impression is that the service is adequate and they generally respond to service call very fast. I would not say it is outstanding though but I can\u2019t make a more in-depth evaluation due to the short stay. Conclusion The W Hong Kong is without doubt a very nice hotel. The room rate is a great value as the hotel room score very highly on the comfort factor and it\u2019s location make this an excellent hotel for travelers on overnight transit. The d\u00e9cor and style of the common areas is not exactly to my taste but I will not discriminate the hotel based on this since the W brand is trying to appeal to the young and trendy crowd in accordance to the chain's brain image. For the room rate charge, I am not expecting top-notch luxury but the materials in the room are of good quality and it\u2019s perfectly decent and very comfortable. I have no qualms about returning to this hotel again.

Stay at the W was generally positive but at times a little odd & aggravating. First off, the rooms are gorgeous with that classic W blend of luxury & minimalism. Rain shower is fantastic and the stone in the bathroom has just the right amount of porousness to make it feel nice & warm on your feet. Mini TV in bath a nice touch. Upgraded to harbour view as a Starwood member & 2:00 late check out. Now the laundry list of the bad. Non-smoking room but it smelled horrible - like cigars covered up with Raid & stripper perfume, just could not get it out of our clothes. Makes you wonder what people are doing to these rooms - definitely brought to mind Mickey Rourke's line about \"carpet cleaner\" from Barfly. Bathroom sink is completely flat with no angle & a drain only at 1 edge so it is virtually impossible to rinse down anything you spit in it - a little gross after a while. Like almost every modern hotel, the lighting system is unnecessarily complicated & fussy - you need a degree in electrical engineering to just leave one light on in the bathroom overnight (I usually end up opting for the make-up mirror). Glass elevators from ground floor to 6th floor lobby not air conditioned & always crowded. When the sun shines on them they are greenhouse hot - supposed to be a swanky feature but you feel like Paul Newman spending \"a night in the box\" in Cool Hand Luke - I definitely did not \"get my mind right.\" 76th floor pool is stunning & breezy but more than a bit of an exhausting scene - clientele divided between weekending Mainland parents fawning over their 1 (or if very wealthy 2) children & men preening for other men & intensely swimming laps while grunting & making faces like they are training for the Olympics . At least in June, after about 14:00 the only sun left is a thin slice near the glass facing the harbour & the beautiful people all pile & wedge themselves in there like it's Gericault's \"The Raft of the Medusa\" or something by Hieronymous Bosch. Also hamburgers are grilled right next to the pool & if you are not a meat-eater it's like sunning next to a crematorium - the grill is big & so are the hamburgers so there is no escape. Check out was understaffed with only 2 people & the line was literally 10 deep - all while at least 3 other staff were in sight but just standing around fussing with their hair - not their job, I guess Overall view more positive than negative but in hindsight I am pretty happy that I don't need to stay here again.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cTranquility in the city\u201d", "Author": "losangelesgirl20", "ReviewID": "UR68428179", "Content": "I just finished a week's stay at the W in HK, and I have to say that I just love staying there.

This is my fourth stay at this hotel in the past 18 months together with my staff, so now I am ready to write a review. This W is very new and well decorated. Rooms are well appointed and of course the heavenly beds are awesome. Transportation to all major areas of Hong Kong is very convenient (taxi, train, MTR) including to/from the airport. If you are looking for a hotel to walk out and \"live\" Hong Kong this is not the place. The hotel is co-located with a shopping mall and no other attractions around. Reaching \"city attractions\" and/or \"points of interest\" will require motorized transportation. Consuming anything (breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks) in the hotel will be expensive even by Hong Kong standards. This hotel will take every opportunity to make money in the form of service fees (10%) and high prices on services and consumables. The staff has a habit of invading personal space with their constant in your face \"can I help you\" while they pace around you whenever you are in a public space which is very annoying. It would be OK if they were to ask you once and then leave you alone. Instead the staff shadows you through public spaces after declining their offer for help. My staff and I typically end up feeling very uncomfortable and \"speeding\" in and out of our rooms and the hotel just to avoid the staff. As with most W hotels the layout of the lobby is totally dysfunctional. The bar and restaurants are not \u201cwelcoming\u201d. Again a lot has to do with the layout itself and the staff. You simply cannot visit a public space, bar, or restaurant without staff all over you. It is hard to enjoy a conversation, drink and/or a meal with friends, colleagues, or business partners when you are being constantly interrupted by the staff with questions and/or removing items from the table in the restaurants and bars. Adding insult to injury, requests not to be interrupted and/or make accommodations for your preferences as a guest are not respected. During the \u201cFootball World Cup\u201d the TV in the bar was not on and I asked for the match that was being played to be shown on TV, my request was denied. I was told that the hotel management had requested that the TV not be turned on at that specific time.

We usually stay away from Kowloon Island but since what we wanted to do this time was mainly on the Kowloon side, we thought we would give it a try and stay with W. First, the location is OK. It's right above the Kowloon Station BUT, if you have a lot of luggage and planning to travel to the hotel with the Airport Express, then we won't recommend staying here coz you'll need to drag your luggages from the station to the hotel. A lot of walking and very confusing like the other people have mentioned. And personally, we hate the mall downstairs (The Element). It's huge but confusing. We don't like the shops there anyway. It's mainly design for the mainland tourist with heaps of luxury shops but to be honest, not that something I will go shop at regularly. The location is not like other hotel in Central or Causeway Bay where you can easily walk to the city and find nice local foods or restaurants. So not recommend to those who are new to Hong Kong and planning to do a lot of sight seeing. Now the room. The room is nice coz we got upgraded to the Fantastic Suit (I was upgraded because my check-in was delayed and was frustrated with the slow check in process). However, we were told by the staff, during check in, that we have 29,000 points with our SGP membership and that we can redeem the rooms for free. I told them that we didn't think we have so many points but if they see it on the system, it can't be wrong and yeah.. why not. So, when we check out, the staff now told us that we don't have enough points to redeem and that redemption needs to be applied online in advance. To be honest, we don't care about paying and we were planning to pay but it tells us that how messy their system is. Worse, their staff never admit that they make a mistake. They make it sounds like it was all our \"miscommunication\". Why can't they just admit and say \"I'm sorry\". Another incident was that on Day 2, we got a message from the hotel saying that our airline trying to contact us. When we called, it was the Lufthansa hotline and obviously the message wasn't for us coz we were flying with Cathy. So, another thing telling us that the system screw up somehow. Oh, did I mention also they sent us the wrong luggage to our room. When I told them that it wasn't our luggage, the staff was like \"oh. where are your luggage\".

I booked two rooms for my family and parents. The hotel is located on the Kowloon side (vs. Hong Kong Island), however the MTR Kowloon Station is located in the Element mall under the hotel. You can take the Airport Express train directly from the airport to the hotel and avoid the crowds and multiple stop. The elevators at Kowloon station could be confusing, however once you get to the mall floor, follow the signs to the W Hotel. If you decide to go to Hong Kong Island, you can take the MTR train also located in the Element mall under the hotel. Hong Kong Island is the next stop so it is really close and convenient. Taxis are also readily available from the first floor if you decide to skip the train. The hotel and mall is very trendy, so expect to dress sharp (jacket) or look out of place. They trained their service staff to look and talk \"cool\", but underneath it all, they provided exceptional service especially to my parents. They even lent us the hotel wheelchair for my father the entire time of our stay. THANKS! The heated pool on the 76th floor cannot be missed! Go there at night to get the most out of the view from the hot tub. The room we had was nice (great shower!), but the view was of the highway and crane ships...so make sure to ask beforehand. Also the TV didn't work and had to be replaced - not a big deal since they did it when we were away for dinner. We didn't eat at the hotel, but there were multiple Chinese food restaurants to choose from at the mall - even an award winning dim sum restaurant. I would also recommend Harbor City (less than 10 minutes by taxi) for additional good restaurants. The small coke in the fridge was over $6 USD, so skip the fridge beverages\u2026there is a grocery store in the mall where you can buy everything you need including good pastries. There is also a Starbucks located in the mall. The concierge service was very helpful so make sure to drop by and have them help plan your day.

It may not be your traditional non-surprising dry hotel and you may have to work a little to find the reception at the sixth floor, but then again you do not come to a W hotel because you like being bored, do you? I stayed here with my son of 15 and he liked it as much as I did. I am a platinum member of the Starwood Preferred Guest program, so I have seen quite a few of their hotels, but W Hong Kong is one of the most remarkable ever stayed in. We arrived at 8.30 in the morning from Paris so I would not have been surprised at all if our room had not been available, but instead the reception went out of their way to offer us a room imediately. We were upgraded to a \"marvelous suite\", which is a sensational corner suite with breath-taking views and, for example, a bathroom where you can have your bath watching TV and in front of a window with sensational harbor view (see our pictures)...I could go on and on about the size and quality of the room.. Then there is the location of the W hotel. It is right next to Kowloon station where you would arrive with the Airport Express Train, 20 minutes ride from HKG airport. Between the station and the hotel is the Elements shopping center, with some good food options (we recommend Wooloomooloo steakhouse, for example). On your way back to the airport you can use the in-city check in, next to the hotel and receive your boarding pass and drop off your luggage already before boarding the Airport Express train. Kowloon station is also an MTR station and in one stop you are at Hong Kong station on the central Island, for example. Don't forget to visit the swimming pool at the 76th floor of the hotel. We noticed that even at this height the neighboring sky scraper had 65 floors above us and it turned out to be the ICC, the World's fourth tallest building. Amazing! Last but no least: DO take your breakfast in the W hotel! The service is friendly and the buffet is overwhelmingly complete, with anything from Asian food to eggs made to your order, to fresh fruit to...to...

However, W Hong Kong ends up being a dissapointment. The rooms are modern and sleek, although not exactly to everyone's taste. However there some design flaws that shouldn't exist in a top hotel. The reception is located on the 6th floor, but even once you get there it's not visible from the lifts. There is no place to wait while the reception staff are busy serving other guests, making for a rather awkward experience on check-in. Free internet is only available in the lobby, turning the small lobby area into an impromptu business centre. However, if you want to check your mail in the evening, you end up sharing this space with a bunch of people having drinks and enjoying loud music. Far from ideal, when one wants to send business emails. The consierge desk seemed empty or understaffed for most of the time. The business centre is closed. The shower in one of the rooms was designed in such a way that it was improssible to prevent water from flowing out into the living room. However, my biggest complaint is reserved for service. W claims to make the guests comfortable by allowing hotel staff to \"be themselves\" and express their own personality. I'm all in favour of hotel staff showing some of their own personality, as long as they are still professional, courteous, and service oriented. I found many of the hotel staff weird and inappropriately friendly. I don't like being greeted by a 22 year old guy telling me \"You're looking tired tonight\" when returning to the hotel in the evening. When that comment was ignored, he continued to say \"Oh you don't get the joke\". Similarly weird remarks were made on other occasions. The concierge ladies were too busy talking to each or speaking on the phone to even make eye contact with guests. Overall I found that most of the staff were not service oriented, attentive or professional. And their effort at showing their own personality just comes across as somewhat chummy, often imature, and obnoxious.

We were disappointed from the moment we entered our room - the room was clearly not properly cleaned after the previous guest, with hair and dirt left all over the bathroom, dirty carpeting in the bedroom and food stains on the table. We called reception and instead of simply moving us to a different room, they had someone from housekeping show up with a vaccum cleaner while we had to vacate our room for 15 minutes. We returned to our room to have a shower and quickly discovered that the shower wasn't draining and that the entire bathroom had flooded. To their credit, the hotel eventually moved us to another, upgraded room. However, what was most annoying was the general style of the staff - most are clearly badly trained - the staff at the front door tended to be overly casual, making innapropriate jokes or chummy comments when we passed. The staff at the beautiful swimming pool were especially unpleasant, more concerned with taking our room details and confirming our right to be at the pool rather than properly welcoming us. Also, the pool staff were sloppily dressed in oversized shirts and mirror sunglasses, and were far too engaged in their own conversations instead of tending to guests' needs. We were also surprised to see one of the pool attendants simply pouring the remains of a drink into the pool. We were also amazed at how often our requests were met with a \"no\" at a hotel which prides itself on \"whatever/whenever\" service. When we wanted to order a snack at the pool, we were told that there is no catering service until 11:00 (and no one remembered our interest in ordering something even though we stayed at the pool 'till noon). When we asked whether it would be possible to take a small suitcase with us on the shuttle to Nathan Road, we were told that if other people also needed to take the shuttle, we wouldn't be able to take the suitcase (even though it fully fit into the trunk of the van and took up no space inside). When we wanted to use the business centre, there was no one there and we had to approach reception. There didn't seem to be any management around during our stay and their absence clearly shows. Overall, the management at the W Hong Kong seems to be trying a new \"relaxed\" approach to guest service, but the result is that service has taken a giant leap backwards.

In previous years, I have stayed at the Marco Polo hotels, mainly bc of it's location. But those hotels (MP Prince, MP Hong Kong and MP Gateway) are pretty much outdated, small, and depressing. The W Hong Kong is definitely sexy, hip, young and energetic. Because of my frequent stays, most of the bellhops and concierge greet me by my name and treat me like family. The rooms are decently sized, but every room has at least one floor to ceiling windows - with city views or harbor views. The floors alternate with either a preppy theme (more masculine) and a Japanese butterfly theme. (more feminine). The furniture is exactly the same, but color schemes are slightly different. Needless to say, I always request a Japanese themed room. It's quite lovely. The mini bar in the room is pretty dangerous. A mini bottle of Veuve Clicquot is hard to turn down! And a great selection of both red and white wine + beers and organic juices. The snack bar also has a nice selection of snacks for those sleepless, jet-lagged nights. Room service for the most part is good. The food comes from the Kitchen - where they also serve buffet. The breakfast buffet is HIGHLY recommended. I've had dinner at Fire restaurant once. The food is amazing, but the main dining room is a bit claustrophobic. I haven't returned for this reason, although I still think about the lobster dish I had. Yum. Every night before dinner, I have a drink in the Living Room. It is usually filled with locals, which bring a different energy level than if it were filled with other hotel stayers. And there is free wi-fi, so it's great. The decor of the hotel is pretty spectacular. I only wish my apartment in NY was this chic and well designed :-( The rooftop pool is amazing. Even though I travel to Hkg so often, I always have a feeling of, \"wow, THIS is Hong Kong\" when I'm at the pool. Unbelievable views. Pack your swimsuit! The Bliss Spa is a must.

The MRT station is also in-house, so transport-wise, the W gets two thumbs up. The lobby on 6th floor is, well, nothing like a usual hotel lobby. It is the epitome of cool, with living room-style seating area next to a nice bar, and interesting decoration just about everywhere. The reception desk is tucked away in a corridor, one of the masterpieces - behind it, there's a huge video wall with moving ornaments? Flowers from another world? Deep sea plants? The staff is friendly and helpful, just not like in other hotels - and that seems to be the overall theme of the W. Differentiation. I received an upgrade to a room with a king size bed on 18th floor, with a view over the harbour in Kowloon that becomes a beauty during sunset. The room itself is quite spacey, 40 sqm or so, with lots of glass and mirrors. It is hard to take a picture of the room without finding yourself in one of the many mirrors. A huge bed, comfy chaiselongue, a big desk with everything you need. A bathroom with a difference, again, all granite and glass, with mood lighting, a nice tub, really well designed and practical as well. The only thing I was missing, at first, was the TV. I found it behind the sliding middle mirror, opposite the bed. A 42\" HD monitor with plenty of channels - and definitely the best sound system I ever had in a hotel room. Complete with subwoofer and great sound quality, it provides a TV viewing experience most people do not even have at home. Naturally you can plug in your own USB devices. The internet works fast, as you would expect, the turndown service is efficient, I always had that big smile on my face as everything was just so perfect. Anything less than perfect? Well, operating the toilet flush might break a fingernail - too much design there. And in the elevators from ground floor up (which have a half translucent video screen as a floor - amazing), pressing the L button gets you - nowhere, because the lobby is on 6, and the exit on 1. But they're working on it, a friendly employee confirmed. After a few stays at W Hotels in New York City, I was not too hot about the brand, as just looking cool is never enough. But the W Hong Kong showed me what the brand is really about. Back in the lobby, opposite the Whatever - Whenever Concierge desk (really nice and efficient) there is a huge painting - Chairman Mao waving his Little Red Book.

You can take a bottle of wine upstairs and drink it on the deck by the pool (just ask first - we brought along duty free wine and some plastic wine glasses). If you get there early enough, you can also order some pool snacks but they close at 9pm so get up there a little earlier. They had an event every night in the bar - we went to a couple of them and they were great. Just bring a shirt/jacket - the air con is freezing! Restaurants are great inside the hotel, and there are also some great ones within Elements. Turn left to the 'food court' and there are a stack of restaurants to choose from. We went to a Thai one that had the best green curry I've ever had (including in Thailand!). I could not find the name for it, but it's the only Thai one next to all the Chinese ones so you should be able to find. We also did room service which was brilliant too. If you've not done so before, we would also recommend taking the junk ride on Victor Habour with Aqualuna. Get there a bit early so you can board first - take a seat upstairs on the long lounges on the side of the junk (downstairs seems to get the fumes from the diesel). You can book this at the whatever/whenever desk or online before you leave home.

Set atop a new development in West Kowloon, the hotels offers a premium service, comfortable living and convenience, all within the modern and well-appointed design typical of a W Hotel. When I arrived, I was immediately struck by how funky the interior is but it still provides comfortable surroundings. The rooms themselves are beautifully furnished with quality upholsteries and the bed is very comfortable to sleep in. The bathroom houses a huge tub with TV, and is tiled in dark stone with interesting lighting. If you like modern design, the W will not disappoint and you will appreciate the high attention to detail such as the sliding mirror cover over the television, patterned wallpaper and open-top drinks cabinet. The pool is one of the highlights of the hotel, and is perched on the 76th floor. The vantage point gives exquisite views of Kowloon and the ocean to the West, while the hot tub looks out towards the harbour and Hong Kong Island. The penthouse pool experience should not be missed and I took a dip every day during the duration of my stay. It would have been ideal to have a bar serving cocktails by the pool but I believe they will soon be introducing this. The infinity pool itself is sizeable and the gold and stone mosaic decoration is an interesting artistic addition. We also enjoyed the Bliss spa service and had a foot soaking and full body massage. The massage was good and pre-treatment relaxation lounge also very comfortable. As hotel guests we were entitled to a complimentary manicure which was very professionally done. We did not try any of the restaurants at the hotel but being on top of the Elements shopping mall and Kowloon MTR/underground station, there is a wide variety of restaurants nearby and all the areas of interest in Hong Kong and Kowloon can be easily reached. The service at check-in and check-out was very quick and we found the staff friendly and accommodating. Overall, I had a great time at the W and will definitely return in the future.

We ate at 3 different places and they were all very good. This type of huge open peaceful space is not easy to find in Hong Kong. We often have heated debates about the location, but in the end, this property provides easy access to the airport express train and HK island via MTR.

It has the look of a modern hip bar/ art museum which made us feel slightly embarrassed when we pass through the lobbies with our 7-year old. Although my son doesn't feel it at all and walks around feeling very at home. In fact, he says it's the best hotel ever (stayed in quite a few) and keeps asking when we're coming back. We think this is largely due to the tv in the bathtub which is a dream come true for him. Staff are very friendly anyway but not intrusive. The rooms are very clean and large, the beds are super-comfy and white and has quite a nice view of the port. Besides the mini-bar, they sell some handy stuff too like umbrellas, guidebooks and converters. Expensive and some are actually lent by other hotels for free. But it was fun reading the descriptions anyway. The internet access in the room was busted (paid, btw). And the engineer couldn't fix it so this is not good news for business travelers. They did send us a letter that the internet was fixed when we got home though. So thanks, I guess...We just used the free 1 hr internet in the lobby. The bathroom was nice but the design of the shower stall is a bit off because the water leaked outside the glass door which flooded the bathroom a bit. I was quite afraid it would leak onto the carpets, thankfully it didn't but there was a big puddle in the middle and small one in the toilet. When we put a bathmat on the door, it was very wet after a shower and still leaked into the toilet stall. Best be careful walking around the bathroom. Otherwise, water pressure is good and the bathtub was big, clean and luxurious. Location is excellent. Hotel is in a mall which has a good grocery (360) and lots of nice restos and cafes and connected to train station. 1 short ride to the airport. Very convenient. Has H&M and See's candies, too. Lastly, we ordered breakfast on our last day and was glad we had breakfast in other places the rest of the time. Not so good. HK has good food in every corner so not a problem.

If all they want is to make a salary and do not really have passion about delivering hospitality or care about guest services, then they should not be working in the hotel industry!! The staff at W needs to take a serious lesson from the attitude of hotel staff working in Thailand or Japan who really take pride in what they do. The food & beverage also sucks big time. We had read some very horrible reviews about the restaurants at W posted on \"openrice.com\" , but we did not really believe them originally. But now we do, we tried the food at their Kitchen, and it was really as bad as people said. All in all, our experience at W was extremely disappointing.

Upon arrival, you are greeted(of course) in typical South East Asian style with a degree of warmth and friendliness seemingly alien to European hotels. Once you find the check in desk(a point of consternation for my parents) which is situated around a corner on the 6th floor of the hotel you are greeted by electro light art and the same smiley faces that greeted you downstairs. I must say the hidden check in desk is the ONLY negative thing I can say about the place as every other aspect is exceptional. Once in the room(I had a cool corner suite) you are greeted by stunning views of the harbour and every gadget and accessory required for the modern traveller. Everything controlled by little buttons which to be honest if ur older than 50 will probably leave you perplexed for the first hour or so. The gorgeous interior can only be matched by the most comfortable bed and pillows I have ever had the privilege to sleep on, which is difficult as one is constantly distracted by the 42 inch TV and Ipod dock which all worked seamlessly(who am i kiddin, i really just played with the electric curtains for 3 days). Food and drinks were once again to the highest standards, including a stunning fish and chips in the \"Lounge\" and a truly remarkable steak in the suitably pricey \"Fire\" restaurant.

We were blown away by the sheer coolness of the new hotel. We arrived via the Airport Express train that literally drops you off in a building that connects to the W. It was a short elevator ride and walk to the W from the train. The W staff that greeted us were very friendly and took our luggage right away. We were shown to probably the coolest elevator I've ever been on (neon lights in the floor, mirrored ceiling, and a view to kill), that took us straight up to the W lobby. Check-in was a breeze and we were shown to our room on the 38th floor. 10 minutes later our bags arrived. Our room had an incredible view of the harbor (not across to Hong Kong island but to the west where many cargo ships are) which made for an amazing sight at sunset every night. The entire room was modern from the unique lighting system to the TV hidden behind a mirrored wall, to the bathroom with a killer shower. The hotel features a pool and hot tub on the 76th floor that overlooks the city - albeit with the soon to be tallest building in HK, the ICC, obstructing the view across Victoria Harbour. Still, it was quite a scene to kick back and relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Perhaps the best part of our stay was the incredibly friendly hotel staff. There was a very friendly gentleman named Sebastian that works out front who speaks great English and offered his advice on everything from where to go and how to get there. The concierges were equally as helpful when we decided to plan a trip to the giant Buddha on Lantau and a day trip to Macau. The only negative thing I have to say about the W were the prices. When I woke up early one morning and the Starbucks in the attached Elements mall wasn't open yet, I walked into Kitchen (restaurant in the W) to get a cup of coffee. When it was all said and done, I calculated that I had spent $7 on a tiny cup of coffee. Lesson learned. The hotel also features free wireless internet access for 1 hour each day which I found to be very useful. You can actually login down in the lobby and then take your computer back up to your room to finish using the rest of the hour in privacy. Having the hotel connected to both a mall and the MTR station was a huge plus. It was a quick ride over to HK island via the MTR whenever we wanted to go. Also, there were 15+ restaurants to choose from in the Elements mall just a short walk from the front door of the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is willing to spend the money for the W experience. It's certainly not for budget travelers.

Check-in is on the 6th floor is difficult to find. We went to the only desk that was immediately visible from the elevator. After watching two workers have a long and lazy conversation, one of them turned to me and said, \"I am the concierge. You don't check-in with me.\" So, off to another line. The check-in area (to the left of the concierge, initially hidden by a wall) is a poorly designed area not meant to accomodate more than 4 waiting guests total. Groups of incoming guests spilled over the sofas, into the hallways around check-in, anywhere, while waiting an abnormally long amount of time to have their check-in processed. And the check-in guys all needed a good smack in the face, a HARD smack in the face, because they were so rude. Once we finally went to check-in (at Noon), they told us that our room wasn't ready and that \"check-in wasn't until 2 pm so come back later\". When we asked about being upgraded, as we were there on our anniversary, we were told \"the hotel was full last night and futhermore, they did not give free upgrades\". We went off to lunch and came back two hours later, only to repeat the 30 minute plus wait to check-in. We had booked a Fabulous Room on the 29th floor and were given the WORST room on the floor, directly across from the elevators. We could hear every word that everyone said as they went to and from the elevators. However, we came to Hong Kong to see the city, not to gawk at the W Hotel, so we could handle it. I liked the butterflies on the lampshades but the overall design and size of the room did not merit the $300 plus we were dropping each night for 4 nights. When I went to the bathroom area I was disgusted to find what looked like mold all over the base of the bathroom walls. I immediately called their \"whatever/whenever service\" and complained. After four more phone calls, including one from a suprisingly snobbish duty manager, we were moved from our room to a Fabulous Suite, which was large, airy and lovely. Over the next few days we were shocked at the number of cheaply dressed, poor looking people that were hanging out in the lobby. The guests of the hotel in NO WAY matched the image. On the second morning we were there, we were woken up at 5:30 am to a loud (fire?)alarm going off in our bedroom. Someone from maintenance came to check on it an hour later and we never received an apology or anything for having to sit in a room with a screeching alarm for over an hour. On the third morning we were there, I went to the gym, where the music was blaring so loud that I could not even hear my iPod with my headphones on full blast. When I came back to my room my key didn't work. I had to go back to the 6th floor in my sweaty workout clothes and then got the third degree before they would give me another key. \"What is your name? What is your date of birth?\" No apology for my key randomly locking me out. My husband had the same thing happen to him later that day and they did not ask him one question. The pool is the highlight of the W Hotel and is allegedly the highest pool in Hong Kong. Gorgeous, gorgeous (partially obstructed) views of the bay. The jaqcuzzi was one of the nicest I've ever been in, an infinity pool leading into some black sea rocks. The experience was only ruined by the rude hotel staff, in the form of the towel boy who decided whether to give you a nice, purple W hotel beach towel or a plain, white, often stained towel. Guess which one he tried to give me every time? There is a giant, inflatable butterfly in the pool which is ridiculous. Back in our hotel room, the rest of the stay wasn't so bad. The little chocolates that were brought each evening 'Sunday is for Soak, Monday is for Martini, Tuesday is for Tea, etc\" were lovely. The bed was exceedingly comfortable. The Bliss products were replenished daily. We went to the LIVING ROOM for dinner one evening. The food was great although the staff hovered too closely. I think the W Hotel is absolutely gorgeous but dislike its poorly trained, rude staff. If you go there you will be made to feel that you are just a number, nothing special, and you might even get the third degree if your hotel key randomly stops working.

We were told the room was being cleaned and they expected it to be available at 1:00pm. We arrived the hotel at 1:10pm but the room has not been cleaned yet. We asked the staff to double check as we were told the room should be ready by then. He did nothing but to repeat the same. He also told us with a blank face that the check in time was 3:00pm. We finally left our cell phone number and went to the LIVING ROOM for lunch. We got our room at 3:15pm. It was bad that we had to wait for two hours even though we had called to confirm the room status. We were more upset with the unfriendly attitude of the staff who did our check in. We asked to talk to the manager but sadly, the guy who was not helping, was the manager. On the other hand, all the other staff we met during our visit were very nice. So it was unfair to rate the service of the hotel as poor because of one person. If we had not encountered the problem at check in, we would have given this hotel a very high rating.

Then if you want to go to Tsim Sha Tsui to take the Star Ferry to Hong Kong Island, you can ride the free shuttle service from the hotel. You can get maps of Hong Kong as well as a visitors' kit from the shuttle, which are very handy for touring the city. The only dining option we tried at the W was the breakfast buffet at Kitchen. The presentation was awesome but we've tasted better. The service was very efficient though and I was able to get a free copy of Newsweek. We checked out the pool too. It was located on the 76th floor and affords really cool views.

The W branding is expertly woven through everything from the 'Whatever' Concierge service to the many different services presented in the room.

Breakfast was in a large cavernous kitchen with a massive selection of different foods, while the dining room was overlooking the busy Typhoon Shelter. For me the best bit of the hotel however was the Swimming pool. Situated on the 76th floor and overlooking the harbor I don't think I've ever swum with such great views. The only slight down-side was the wind, which did make swimming a little like something out of a Perfect Storm, but the attendant did tell us that its not normally like that.

I agree with other reviewers that the hotel could not be easier to get to from HKG with a short hop on the airport express and then a well signposted stroll through the Elements shopping mall. In general I liked the modern design, swish rooms and public areas. Some of the floor surfaces and wallpapers are however very reflective and I can imagine a few migraines being induced on sunnier days. If you resort to wearing sunglasses your likely to bump into things as the corridor and lift lighting is set very low. The rooms are an ok size, it is HK after all. Most seem to have some kind of restricted views across the harbour to HK island. Nothing stands still in HK for very long and an enormous skyscraper is currently nearing completion and rather spoiled the views from my very nice corner room. I'm used to HK prices. My main gripe with this hotel is that the bar and restaurant pricing verges on the ridiculous. Nearly \u00a310 for G&T, 20 HKD... Surely in light of evident low occupation rates, world recession etc etc, the management will have the common sense to moderate their pricing. Otherwise the place will be a nice wee one night special treat sort of place rather then fulfilling its potential as a longer duration stopover location. I wouldn't rate the staff as overly helpful or interested, not at the prices charged. I had to wait two and a half hours for my room to be available, from 1 pm. Not too early a check in methinks. As a wee comfort, they gave me a voucher for one coffee, which usually costs \u00a36 I think. Their generosity knows no bounds. Nice pool area on 76 floor although when I was there it was so windy up there it was unusable if not dangerous on the slippy, windswept surfaces. The W is I think a victory of style over substance.

Everything is so hip and fashion, the amazing swimming pool on the 76th floor, the elevators, the very good breakfast buffet in the restaurant (a bit pricy but good quality), the lobby, WoW. Otherwise, the hotel is connected with the nice shopping mall 'Elements' which is connected with the subway + train to the airport, very convenient. The little problem is that the hotel is in Kowloon a bit far from everything. Otherwise, WoW !

Hip, stylish & comfortable!\u201d", "Author": "3cia", "ReviewID": "UR26644930", "Content": "I booked our room through my travel agent. I don't know what to expect as I've just seen pictures of the hotel from Belle Australian interior design magazine while renovating our new home. We go to Hongkong 2-3 times a year. Mainly for relaxation & some shopping. My husband & I took airport express which cost us hk$140. They accept credit card payment. Upon reaching the Kowloon station, we took the lift then walked into Elements mall following the W sign. It is easy because our luggages have 4 wheels so I would recommend that. Upon reaching HMV, a bell guy approached us asking if we're heading to W? He gladly took our luggages and accompanied us to 6/f. The permeating scent upon entering the hotel is relaxing. On the 6th floor, we were shown the reception and check-in was a breeze. No lines!!! The guy in the reception was very accommodating, even offered us late check out. And gave us an upgrade. After we were given our card keys, the bell guy Gerard took us to 33rd floor. He showed us the amenities & gadgets of our room and asked us if we have any other questions. ROOM: We are impressed with our room. Their harbor view has a view of, well the harbor, ships & container vans. Having the usual harbor view from our usual hotel in Canton Road, this is a welcome change. We love it. With the bed, I was quite skeptical at first because it was so soft. So unlike my bed at home which is semi-firm. I was wrong! This is the best hotel bed I've had since Oriental Bangkok! I always wake up in the morning recharged. It's literally like sleeping on clouds. I love the many switch for lighting. Mentioned in one of the reviews was the bright light shining directly unto the pillow which I thought too can't be switched off until my husband pointed out to me the switch for that. He's a techie so he really enjoyed the room design. The room is excelllently designed and it feels like the room is big. There is a small ref, coffee & tea facilities, dvd player and a good quality LCD tv. The speakers are awesome. We once got back in the room before sunrise, played some 80's music and stayed til sunset. The best! Housekeeping cleans the room thoroughly. I place the card on the bed each morning so they'll change the sheets. They have turndown service at night. It's so nice to come home to your room tired from all that shopping & sightseeing to see your bed ready :) BATHROOM: Design of the bathroom is good too. One has the option to leave it open but still have privacy as the shower & water closet has sliding door. But if you want total privacy, you can just pull two huge sliding door mirrors together and it is an enclosed bathroom. I am very picky with hotel bathrooms but W surpassed my expectations. I rarely use the bath tub in hotels but this time I did. The bath tub is separate from the shower. And it is clean plus there is a tv. I love the Bliss products - shampoo, conditioner, face wash, body wash, soap & lotion. I took home some but regret not buying regular sized bottles in the spa. Maybe when we go back. A lot of thought went to designing the bathroom. Even in the shower where you put the toiletries, even that has lighting! Oh and this is one of the nicest hotel shower, it has overhead rain shower plus a telephone style shower. Water pressure is strong. One thing unique from other usual hotels, they have a loofah sponge. And I absolutely love the fluffy towels!!! And W is generous with towels. Housekeeping goes around at night to ask if we want more drinking water & towels. Who can beat that? HOTEL FACILITIES: The Kitchen restaurant is stylish but we didn't get to try their breakfast since we often wake up late. We checked out the spa on the 73/f(?) and a staff named Rosa, gladly showed us around. The treatment rooms are nice. Not bad for a city spa. They even have couple's treatment room. I never went swimming in any hotel in HK but the pool on the 76th floor looked so inviting that hubby & I went for a dip one early morning. Super relaxing is the heated whirlpool. Sitting there with a view of the city & harbor is a unique experience. W prides itself as having the highest swimming pool in HK right now. The outdoor shower is simple but stylish and so is the rest room. W used Kohler brand for their fixtures. After some laps in the pool, we were given bottles of water before we left. We tried their shuttle service on our 2nd day. It leaves every 30 minutes but you have to inform the bell guys in the lobby. Gerard the bell guy is always at hand to assist us. Turned out he's a Filipino and the housekeeping guy is a Flipino too so that makes the W experience a homely one for us. They provided us with a silver Audi Q7 for our shuttle that time. The W senses continues in their shuttle service. Same music & scent. And clean too. We go back & forth the hotel and Canton Road a few times in a day. Sometimes, the service is a Toyota van. We use taxi when going back to W. We take taxi from our usual Marco Polo Hotel in Canton Road. Taxi is HK$18-20. As for the internet, I used the one in the room with charge as I was lazy to go down. On our 2nd night, my hubby & I hung around in their Living Room for internet and it's a lovely place with a club vibe. So I highly recommend this. This is same set-up with other luxury hotels we've tried in other countries so no problem. SHOPPING & DINING: I was surprised with Elements mall. It was big and carry many brands like Zara, H&M, Kate Spade, Cartier, Piaget etc. Hermes is opening soon. I was happy to see Le Maison du Chocolat! They also have Victorinox, which I was able to buy kitchen knives I need. I just noticed they don't have LV & Chanel(only cosmetics). The mall is still new. There are many restaurants in Elements and we get to try a noodle place across 360 but I forgot the name. 360 has many food bars. We got to try the gourmet sandwich, some cake, shrimp wonton noodle soup. Good enough if you're feeling lazy to go to Canton Road. We bought some sushi there one afternoon and it's excellent quality. 360 has many organic food products on their shelves. When we go to Canton Road, we go to our usual haunts. H&M is opening soon. There's a newly opened Muji in Ocean Terminal. All brands are available there plus the restos like Sweet Dynasty, Taiwan Beef Noodle House & Guandong BBQ House. We always eat cheap & yummy in HK. Food Republic in Silvercord is a good bet. Dimsum, noodles & roasted dishes plus dessert. Pepper Lunch just opened. For a good yummy dessert to go, try Hui Lau Shan in Haiphong Road. We love the mango with jelly in coconut milk. I recommend Zurich(for Rolex & Patek Philippe) and Yes Watch(Rolex, Audemars Piguet, Franck Muller) in the area of Nathan Road. I noticed everytime we come back in a taxi, the bell guys always open our door and say \"welcome back\" and always offer to assist us with out shopping bags. They even check the taxi for anything we might leave behind. Check out was stress free too. The bell guys made sure our taxi driver knows our next destination which is in Causeway Bay. We did regret not staying in W for the whole of our trip. We stayed here for 2 nights 3 days only as I want to try another hotel in HK island which was a disappointment. Our stay in W made us relaxed, recharged and feeling happy. I would make W my base on my next HK visit if my travel agent can get me the same rate.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tunbridge Wells", "Title": "\u201cUber-cool\u201d", "Author": "TunbridgeWellsTrevor", "ReviewID": "UR26544009", "Content": "Firstly, it could not be easier to get to: the second stop on the fast train from the airport is Kawloon.

I already am dying to go back. Like others have said, this is certainly a trendy, ultra high-tech, modern hotel. I had to call down to the Front Desk to ask how to turn on the TV (turns out you have to slide over a glass panel first - HA)! I would hardly call this a \"negative\" though. The polite, helpful staff, incredible amenities, clean, gorgeous rooms, great location and awesome gym made it all worthwhile. While they do not offer free internet in the rooms (I really didn't expect it), they did have complimentary Wi-Fi in the Lobby area, which I happily used in their comfortable, peaceful Living Room area one morning. It was so calm and cozy, I could have stayed there all day (but alas, I had shopping to do)! Check-in and check-out were a total breeze and the Front Desk staff were so nice and pleasant. On your way to the room, one notices how sleek and quick the elevators are and how serene and beautiful the hallways are. There are also these cute panels outside of each room that designates \"Do Not Disturb\" or \"Please Make Up My Room\". Very cool! And then of course the rooms themselves are soooooo incredible. Love the Bliss products in the bathroom, plush slippers, soft robes, and all the buttons and switches for the various lights, curtains, TV, etc! The gym was also incredibly high-tech. The machines are equipped with TVs and electronic panels that control just about everything. The hotel's location was also incredibly convenient - right above the Kowloon Airport Express station (and an MTR station) and connected to the beautiful Elements shopping mall.

I loved their complimentary tea as well. The toiletries are usable and of good quality. Buffet breakfast was like a treasure hunt because of the way food was presented so we had fun. Fresh fruit juices was the best as well as the different kinds of berries in their spread. My niece enjoyed the yoghurt station where they mix fresh fruits and yogurt on a frozen marble slab (like ColdStone's). In general, food was very healthy gourmet type. Most of their restaurants are very hip and not very suitable if you have young kids but other places to eat can be found at Elements mall.

We stayed at the W hotel for almost 2 weeks. Overall our stay was pleasant but with a few bumps. First, arriving there from the airport is direct, fast and easy. The hotel is located at Kowloon Station, and the Elements Mall. It is a bit of a pain to haul your heavy luggage through the mall to get to the hotel reception, but there are signs everywhere guiding you easily to the W, and kind keen mall boys to point you in the right direction. First impressions are high in it's category of designer hotels. The flashy elevator teleports you into the world of 'Whatever/Whenever'. Check-in was a breeze. We were given our room key and guided to the elevator, but not to our rooms. I do like being taken to the room and having all the facilities explained to me. However, the room was very nice, high-tech, spacious and clean. A welcome letter with your name on it was already in the room, neat things about the hotel and vouchers. Our luggage arrived to the room after 20 minutes, which I think is a bit long after a 13 hour flight when all you want to do is take a bath and change. We booked a wonderful room with King size bed. First thing you notice is the beautiful stone tiled bathroom (dries fast of wet foot prints), complete with 2 sets of bliss bathroom amenities. They were a pleasure to use. The room also had a Vidal top of the line hairdryer, built into drawer so no messy wires in the way. Extra toothbrushes, razors, shaving creams, nail files, cotton, swabs etc. Everything in twos for the whole duration of our stay. Shoe shiner and sewing kit, slippers, bathrobes, hangers, safe, daily newspapers etc. Everything you would expect from a 5 star. We had a separate bathtub with built-in mini tv. The rain shower was to die for and one of the best showers I've ever had. There's one door shared between the toilet and shower. Smart design, didn't inconvenience us. Cool way to make the most out of the space. The toilet was hard to flush, as you have to push the small button in the wall with your longest finger to flush. The toilet doesn't flush well either. You really have to push the button until it finishes flushing. It strained my finger each time. The bathroom can be apart of the room or closed up completely with the sliding doors, so you can have privacy. The bed was uber comfy and luxurious. The pillows were like sinking into bliss. The different lighting settings were cool too, except when your really wanted 'black out' the lights on the night stand still glowed. The only way to rid of them completely is covering them with towels or taking the room card out of the slot. Beware, If you choose to take the room card out of the slot, you can't charge your phone or devices anymore, for example, because there's no electricity to the room. Air-con doesn't work as well, but not too bothered with air-con anyway. Too much air-con in Asia. I always try to escape it. Ventilation was good. The rooms are very sound proof as well. I didn't hear one neighbour. Complaints. The hot jacuzzi on the top floor was pleasurable, but the whole pool terrace wasn't so inviting. The big pool was just a rectangle to do laps, quite windy up there as well. Still cool to be on top of all the buildings. Only went and used it once and had no desire to really go back, and didn't. The gym is 24hrs and does the job, used it often. You are given only 2 small bottles of water in your room each day, but you can have as much bottled water on Swimming level and gym level. Also, I've stayed in lavish places before, but I think they exaggerated some of the prices. Extra water in the rooms were at a charge of like HK$70 (7 euros) A can of soda was HK$50, the food was expensive (better off eating in the mall). Laundry was a joke, for underwear or socks it was around HK$60-70 a piece. Dry clean or hand wash were virtually the same price, extra for pressing (you can buy new ones for less). Internet did not come with the room price, and also over priced! Free internet only available in the lobby and you can take it to your room after connecting for 3 hours, sometimes less. The daily room cleaning wasn't top notch. I had spilled some of my silver eyeshadow on the sink and it stayed there around some of the sink joints. I had asked to have our sheets changed as it had been 3 days (they try to use a 3 day environmental policy - though you can request to have your sheets changed everyday if you like) The sheets looked changed, but at closer view they didn't get changed, so I called to make sure they get changed next room cleaning (was exhausted to have someone come in right away) Next day we arrive to our room after cleaning and find the same sheets, and clean ones on the lounge chair. I called and asked if they expected us to change the sheets? I asked for someone to correct this, we left for dinner and upon return the clean sheets on the lounge were taken, but the same old sheets! I called and so to not loose face said there was a misunderstanding and to have the sheets changed. They finally did it, but it made me wonder if it was being done on purpose. One day our room wasn't made up at all, even after calling and pushing the 'make room button'. I guess these things can happen if you stay for 2 weeks. Also all my amenities were being replenished except for hair conditioner. During turn down service I mentioned it to one of the girls, and she kindly and promptly returned with 2 big size conditioner bottles. Concierge desk was very helpful and extra things and places to go around Hong Kong. The location was a bit on the side, but really not a problem. One MTR station from central. Taxis are cheap in HK and if you go through the mall and take the exit by the skating rink, you'll find yourself on Austin Road and once done, it will be easy forever. We would walk to the Star Ferry and Temple street easily, but I am used to walking living in Paris. Enjoyed the exercise. Felt stupid taking taxis to some of these places in the first place (especially to temple street market) Got sick from seafood last day and got a late check-out. A hotel doctor cost was HK$1200, not including drugs, but an alternative was mentioned to me, which was the medical clinic in the elements shopping mall. Got treated with a shot and drugs all for just HK$250. So there you have it. I miss the shower, the bed and bliss amenities. Don't regret my stay. The staff were nice and helpful when you saw them. Great for young couples or design freaks. But I think I will stay at the pricier Hyatt, JW or Intercontinental next time.", "Date": "March 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beijing", "Title": "\u201cnot the real hong kong experience\u201d", "Author": "spoilednomad", "ReviewID": "UR25412989", "Content": "Stayed there for a weekend end of Feb. 09.

They advertised a \"fabulous room\" with a harbour view on the net, but what I got was a PARTIAL HARBOUR VIEW. I felt cheated. The view was mostly ugly appartment blocks, and then, in between two of them, there was a glimpse of Victoria Harbour and the skyline of Central (and that only after upgrading to a different room category). Of course, it is a hip boutique hotel, and if you deeply care about the design of the hangar in your closet, this hotel is for you. Otherwise, try other hotels which are in the midth of things (like the Lankwaifang Hotel, not to be confused with the LKF Hotel) or which have a REAL harbour view, like the good old Intercontinental or the Conrad (upper floors).", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangkok, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Service!

I emailed them previously and gave them a long list of things I needed for my baby -- baby bathtub, crib, bottle sterilizer, baby food warmer, volt regulator (for my breastpump which was 110v), connecting rooms, etc. And they said they will take care of all of it... and they did. Check in was a breeze thanks to Tim at the Front Office. When we got to our COOL CORNER ROOM connected to a Spectacular Room, we were amazed. Everything we requested was arranged neatly in the room, waiting for us! And the baby things were brand new. They had an Avent Sterilizer and Mothercare Bottle/Food Warmer which looked unused! Perfect for us because we had the same brand at home and it was like we brought our own stuff there without the hassle! Rooms were gorgeous. The view was great. ICC building was blocking part of the view, but it was nice overall. It looked out unto HK side. If we were in the room during the Light Show, we would definitely see it. Decor was amazing. So chic and modern. Loved it. Toiletries were wonderful to use. We went over to FACESS in Ocean Terminal to buy more Bliss toiletries!!! I thought that the bathroom of the Spectacular Room was nicer than the Cool Corner Suite was nicer because the shower was in a separate area as compared to Cool Corner Suite which was in one bigger space... although the tub area in the Cool Corner Suite had a view.... so it made up for the joint space. I thought the extra space in the bedroom of the Cool Corner Room was worth it because the room had a little table where we had breakfast. And a couch we can lounge around on. Besides, with kids, the extra space was great. We used the IPod Dock for the kids' lullabies. There was only one cartoon channel, but it's understandable. I doubt that they have a lot of guests who watch cartoons! We had lots of shopping to do and didn't get to enjoy the pool But we visited it before checking out and it was so nice. We felt bad we were going home so soon and didn't get the chance to use it. LIKES... no, LOVES!!!: 1.Bed was uber comfortable with it's plush/pillow top. Sheets were PIMA COTTON 400threadct. So it was really nice to sleep on. It was so hard to wake up in the mornings because it was so nice to snuggle with the hubby and kids!! 2. Everything was so clean. I NEVER walk barefoot in hotels because I am scared of unsanitary carpets etc. But this was an exception. 3. Service is unbelievable. Whatever you ask for, they will go out of their way to help you. Everyone was so warm and friendly. They were smiling all the time and greeted us by name. Very well trained staff. Other hotels should learn from them! My son wanted to play with his Lightning Mcqueen remote control car. But we didn't have a screwdriver to open it to put batteries inside. They sent up a man from Engineering with a screwdriver. He not only lent us the screwdriver but actually help get it to work for my son! I tried to tip him after, but he wouldn't accept! DISLIKES 1. The location. It's on top of a high end mall. We were able to do some shopping at Elements, but not all our favorites... H&M didn't have kidswear. Zara was ok. No Toys R Us, Muji, Louis Vuitton, FACESS, etc. 2. Restaurants nearby are not that great. When in HK we only eat Chinese food. We love eating Peking Duck. But since we were with little kids, we didn't want to venture far from the hotel at night. So unfortunately, we had to stay in the mall, ate at Lei Garden on both nights we were there. Not fantastic. Just ok. 3. Didn't know where to get a HK breakfast with congee, noodles and the Chinese donut... Had to settle for the bakery in the mall. :( La Creation Gutten or something like that... Thanks KateTam for recommending this hotel. IT WAS SUCH A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE FOR THE FAMILY! We're so glad we chose this hotel. Since I had a special needs baby and needed to be away from crowds, this hotel was perfect for us. Wish the mall had more stuff.... would love it if W Hotel was on top of Ocean Terminal/Harbour City!

It\u2019s uber-cool, cutting edge design from the kinetic floors in the elevators, the huge video screen behind reception ( mind you, if I worked on reception for too long, I\u2019d be wanting compensation for my burnt out retinas) to the bathroom sink, and minibar. The clever one-touch mood lighting controls by the bed are great from a tech-spec point of view, though a bit annoying if you just want to turn the lights out and sleep. Having the airport express station directly below you is a bonus, and if you\u2019re someone in need of yet another Prafengu (Prada Fendi Gucci) mall, in Elements, then this is the place for you. Bathroom is great, (yes, coz we all need a TV in the bath), the shower sublime, although I\u2019m not sure about the shared sliding door for the loo and the shower cubicle..i.e. if you\u2019ve got the door shut on the loo, then the shower area is open. But on returning to the hotel after a day hanging out in and exploring the gorgeous, perfectly dog-eared, sensual delight that is the heart of Kowloon, I felt like: what am I doing here? The W just seemed a bit sterile....too clever..too designed. I booked directly via the hotel website, a \u2018Spectacular\u2019 room (3515, about \u00a3170 a night during the soft opening) facing towards HK Island, but of course, what they don\u2019t mention on their website is the HUGE skyscraper right in your face as you search for that mythical, evocative view of the Island. Still, you can get a wonderful view on the Star Ferry, which partly makes up for what you don\u2019t get from the hotel room. We DID enjoy the bar, although it is another full-on, hyper-hip design confection that will look outdated within 5 years. BUT in its favour, there was a fantastic female bartender with cropped blond hair, who made excellent martinis (fanciful fruit ones, but also a great hand at the traditional one too). We both travel with laptops and thought it a bit odd, not to mention out and out mercenary, to have free wi-fi in the lobby, but to charge you for 24 hour use if you connect in the room . Maybe you can connect down there, and then bring your laptop up to your room, but it niggled us slightly. These days, wi-fi in a 5-star hotel should be a given. Perhaps I\u2019ve just overdone the boutique/funky/hip hotel thing recently, but looking back now I think I\u2019d rather stay in somewhere less funky and tech-savvy over in Tsim Cha Tsui and with a bit more Chinese or Asian soul and character . But if I was planning on entertaining my music/media/ fashion friends, or clients who\u2019d appreciated the clubby vibe of the W, then sure, spend the money and enjoy. . It was without a doubt COOL, but it wasn\u2019t a particularly romantic place or full of character... I think that\u2019s my main gripe, but I can\u2019t fault this place for service or presentation. Next time in HK, I\u2019ll happily go there for a drink, but wouldn\u2019t make it my base.", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cReally great!\u201d", "Author": "k01lk", "ReviewID": "UR23903250", "Content": "I arrived in the evening of January 25th, without expecting a lot from the place where I had to stay for 3 nights.

Until then, it's more Poseur City, more Too Cool For You, more Be thankful you're allowed to stay somewhere so \"hip\" (and the quotation marks are there for a reason). For points [--](PLAT): W Hotel is too cool to give you SPG Platinum amenities, and are the only part of the Starwood chain that makes you pay for internet (18/day), has no lounge or free breakfast (or free anything). They do upgrade you, and we scored a corner room on 23, which means two elevator rides to get to your room. Look carefully and you'll find the elevator button, but only if you look real close. They wouldn't want to do anything uncool like just have a button. The big problem with the hotel is all the uber-tech BS in the room, like: you cant turn on/off one light; it's almost all or none; the annoying console next to your bed that controls the shades and lights is so bright you have to cover it up at night; the closet light is bright and literally cannot be turned off, so you have a nightlight whether you want it or not. The air handling system sucks every drop of moisture from the air and they give you two TINY bottles of water, but don't worry, there's a $10US bottle next to it. (Unlimited free waters in the gym). Upsides: The gym is pretty good, the locker rooms have amazing hot tubs with astonishing views. The pool is incredible. the shampoo etc is Bliss (there's a bliss spa on 72). There are 2 OK and way overpriced western restaurants (2 salads, 2 soups, 2 diet cokes and a drink = $100US). The locations is great, right above the MTR and Airport Express and adjacent to a mall with a Starbucks. The views are amazing if you can see through the smog. Overall, I will say it's a nice hotel, overdesigned, too precious and hip for its own good, with the W staff attitude that they are cooler than you (and they aren't). If you're SPG platinum, do the Meridien or Sheraton.

The rooms occupy the 16th through 38th floors, with the lobby on the 6th floor and the ground floor having the drive-up lobby and access to the Elements shopping mall. There are two sets of elevators, one runs between the ground level and lobby and the other set between the lobby and the guest rooms. This means you have to use two elevators when leaving the hotel or returning. On the guest room floors, the elevator buttons are disguised in a bookcase wall decoration and hard to find. Two elevators also go up to the 76th floor where the pool is, and we found that sometimes those elevators would not stop at the guest room floors \u2013 so we ended up avoiding those elevators. As noted by others, check-in during peak afternoon hours was inefficient, with some waiting while the front desk checked available rooms. We rejected the first room offered as it had a faint reek of cigarette smoke even though it was on a no-smoking floor. The replacement room was not ready so we were told to return 2 hours later at 4pm. We did, but it took a 1/2 hour at the front desk to verify that our room was ready. When our bags did not arrive we had to call, after which they arrived promptly. The room, like everything in the hotel, has a dark grey color tone which is chic but cold. Some friends told us the room was 430 square feet, which seemed right. There are several annoying puzzles, such as how to use the TV (it\u2019s hidden behind a sliding glass wall) and how to use the lights. You don\u2019t have control over each individual light in the room \u2013 instead there are buttons that allow you to select \u201cday,\u201d \u201cnight\u201d or \u201cdream\u201d \u2013 each of which is a lighting scheme. There are canned ceiling lights over the bed headboard which shine directly into your eyes when you lie down. These can be turned off by pressing a button next to the bed that\u2019s labeled \u201cPillow\u201d which we discovered by accident, thinking the button had something to do with puffing up the pillows or something. The lights generally fade in or out, so there\u2019s a time delay between when you flip the switch and when something actually starts to happen. The \u201cdream\u201d setting turns out the main lights for sleeping and turns on footlights under the bedstands and the bathroom counter that are too dim to disturb sleeping but bright enough so you can navigate if you wake up in the middle of the night. This is a thoughtful and useful feature. The labeling of the light switches reflects the Hotel\u2019s penchant for cute names that make it difficult to figure out what\u2019s what. The hotel directory book in the room even has a translation guide (\u201cwet\u201d = pool, \u201cfire\u201d = ground floor bar, \u201cbliss\u201d = spa, etc.). The room has a floor lamp with separate fader switch. The window has sheer curtains and a thick blackout curtain, both of which are motorized. We had a \u201cfabulous\u201d room which I think means it had a harbor view. The view is not of the harbor towards Central, which is almost completely blocked by the new ICC tower, but is west towards Lantau Island. The pillow-topped beds and down pillows are extremely comfortable. Our room had 2 double beds which were somewhat cramped for 2 adults (definitely not queen-sized). Each bed has a small reading light on a wand, like you find in the business class section of airlines. There\u2019s the usual wet bar items and hard liquor. The free in-room coffee/tea uses a boiler kettle and a stainless steel plunger-style infusion coffee maker. A packet of poor-quality coffee in a filter pouch suitable for a Mr. Coffee maker is supplied. Amazingly, when I called and asked for decaff, the hotel said they didn\u2019t stock any and would have to go the grocery store to buy some at my expense. No thanks. Two small bottles of water are supplied gratis and restocked each day. Each morning the hotel delivers the South China Morning Post into a small bag that hangs outside the room door. The hotel, which has a motto of \u201cWhatever, Whenever,\u201d indicated other papers were available on request. I took them up on the offer and called to ask for both the Post and the Herald Tribune. After some confusion, they confirmed that both would be delivered but the next morning I only got the Post. I called to remind them that two papers were to be delivered and, after the same confusion about whether it was doable, delivered the Tribune. The same routine was repeated on the second morning when they delivered only the Post again. The bathroom is large with a large sink and two faucets. The bathroom can be closed off by two sliding walls that meet at a corner or kept open to the bedroom. A sliding frosted glass door closes off either the separate shower stall or the toilet stall. When one takes a shower, the toilet stall is left open. After the shower, sliding the door open results in water dripping off it into the toilet entry. Also, since there is no step-over into the shower, water leaks out onto the bathroom floor. The hotel left a rolled up a towel on the floor in front. In the shower you can use either a hand-held shower wand or a rain bath from holes in the ceiling. The spray is even and gentle, but if you are the kind that likes a powerful stream of spray, you\u2019re out of luck. The bath also has a wand as well as a waterfall spout which is neat to watch but takes about 50% longer to fill the tub. The drain made a tremendous groaning noise unless the valve was set exactly right. There were 4 sets of heavy, luxury towels so we never had to call for extra towels, 2 thick terry-cloth robes and two sets of disposable slippers. The hotel provides both hard soap and liquid soaps. The liquid bath soap is labeled \u201cSoapy Sap\u201d and indeed smelled like tree sap, as did the shampoo and conditioner (labeled \u201csage\u201d). My wife thought the scent was attractive. One thing I liked was that the small bottles were clearly labeled \u201cshampoo\u201d and \u201cconditioner\u201d in large letters \u2013 usually the print is so small you can\u2019t read it. There\u2019s a lighted make-up mirror in the bathroom which you cannot turn off separate from the bathroom lights and it can be bothersome glaring at you while you\u2019re brushing your teeth. The electric plug is located around the side of the main mirror in an inconvenient location, and is the usual US/Euro 110V/220V combo. The bathroom counter has a fixed table lamp with a handy shelf to hold your small items. The bath has a small TV but it\u2019s tricky to use the remote control. The TV has two sensors so unless you point exactly right, when you press the \u201con\u201d button the sound will come on but not the video. We thought the TV was broken and the hotel had to send an engineer to explain the problem. The desk is well set-up with internet LAN ports, several electric outlets (Hong Kong 3-prong plug), and a desk lamp that is handy but located on the right side and therefore casts a shadow on the paper if you write right-handed. The wet bar snack tray has a universal electric plug adapter for your use that accommodates polarized 2-prong US plugs (where one prong is larger than the other). It does not accommodate US 3-prong plugs. There is a video port so, if you have the right cable, you can connect your laptop to the TV. There are also internet LAN ports next to the bed. The hotel charges HK$40/hour or HK$140/day for internet access. Free unsecure wireless access is available in the 6th floor bar area, but seemed to be limited to 3 hours. The telephone uses a touch screen and was somewhat confusing to decipher. Local calls are HK$5 for up to 30 minutes. The electronic in-room safe is wide and flat, perfect for laptops with room for other items. The large flat-panel TV has surround sound (speakers in the ceiling) and a powerful sub-woofer. Loud sounds like explosions in a movie made the room vibrate, but the room sound insulation appeared to be excellent. We never heard anything from adjacent rooms, the hallway or outside. There is a separate DVD player that can play US-formatted DVDs (region 1). For those who like to eat cheap, there\u2019s not much available as there are only \u201cnice\u201d restaurants in the upscale Elements mall and building complex, which is isolated by undeveloped land and construction sites from the rest of Kowloon. However, the \u201c360\u201d grocery store in the mall has a pastry section, gelato bar and 3 food counters: one for Chinese and Japanese noodle and rice bowls (about HK$50), one for sandwiches, coffee and egg dishes (omlettes), and a grill for a variety of hot dogs and burgers (e.g., chili dogs, Hawaiian burgers). There\u2019s also a small pastry shop in the mall near the hotel entrance that looks fancy but actually is cheaper than the grocery store. Both the bakery and 360 open at 8am. We ate in the mall at a Shanghai-style restaurant called Xia Mian Guan that was not cheap but pretty reasonably priced. It had excellent food and great xia long bao steamed dumplings. There\u2019s usually a line outside but the turnover is fast. As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is at the Kowloon station on the airport express railway and MTR (subway) Tung Chung line, with non-stop access to Hong Kong station on the Island. From HK station, it\u2019s about a 7 minute walk through a new underground passageway to the MTR Central station and access to the MTR red and blue lines. There is no easy way to get to Tsim Sha Tsui from the hotel, except by taxi or free hotel shuttle that runs every half hour. Taxi access to Central is quick via the Western Tunnel which is adjacent to the hotel. Getting your check-in luggage from the hotel to the Kowloon airport express station under the mall is a bit problematic. The hotel said there was a dispute with the mall which doesn\u2019t like hotel porters pulling luggage carts through the upscale mall. But if you check-in for your flight early, say 8 or 9am before the shops open at 10, then the hotel porters can help you take your luggage through the mall to the station. Another advantage of checking in early is that there are no lines. Otherwise, you can use a taxi for the 1-minute drive to the station entrance for HK$16. In order to use the station check-in, you must buy an airport express ticket for travel to the airport. If there are 3 or more in your party, ask the human attendant at the ticket counter for a group or family rate. We paid HK$190 (one-way) instead of HK$270 for the 3 of us. The discount is not available on the ticket machines. We found it convenient to check our luggage and get boarding passes for our United Airlines flight early, then have breakfast, walk around, freshen up in our room and check out of the hotel before taking the 20-minute train ride to the airport.", "Date": "January 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel; Awkward Vibe\u201d", "Author": "ModernDayNomad", "ReviewID": "UR23362507", "Content": "The W Hong Kong is a mixed bag. While it's a very, very nice hotel, it's a property that appeals to a narrow demographic. You definitely have to think of yourself as a \"Swinger\" if you're going to stay at a W, and the W Hong Kong epitomizes the brand. W definitely appeals to a young clientele, and it's difficult to feel comfortable at a W if you don't fit the target audience. It does not pull off effortless luxury like the Inter-Continental or The Peninsula. The W is definitely trying (and in my opinion trying too hard) to be hip and fashionable. That said, the W Hong Kong is a beautiful hotel. The rooms must be some of the most luxurious in the city. Plush linens, soft lighting, plasma TVs, and slate bathrooms are a treat for the senses. (The shower was the best I've ever experienced). If you're looking for luxury, you can't go wrong. The lobby bar and restaurant (6th floor) were equally stunning, but neither offers a nice view. In fact, a 100+ storey high rise has been built between the hotel and Victoria Harbour, so the views are broken. The rooftop pool (76th floor) is stellar, however, and if you're in Hong Kong in the summer, the pool at the W must be one of the best in town. The W's location does leave something to be desired if you're in Hong Kong to see the sights. As others have noted, the hotel is a good 2 kms from the Tsim Sha Tsui and the Star Ferry Terminal. It's a taxi ride; not a walk. (Taxis are very, very cheap, however, and many drivers speak English). The hotel is also connected to the MTR, and Hong Kong Central Station is only one stop away, but it's not as convenient as a hotel in Hong Kong or in Tsim Sha Tsui. The hotel is also connected to the Elements Shopping Center. It's a massive mall with top-end designers and restaurants. Overall, I'd have to recommend the W Hong Kong. If I return, I'd probably stay at the Inter-Continental because it has the best location and the most stunning views in all of Hong Kong.

However, it's directly above Kowloon rail/airport express/metro station. Kowloon is 1 stop from Hong Kong/Central station (accross the Victoria Harbour, on Hong Kong island), so it's actually very easy to pop to Hong Kong by metro, once you've done the Star Ferry thing at least once. The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, the hotel staff very friendly and cpable to help you with suggestions on what to see/do, dinner reservations and anything else you might need.

Then you need to go back to the lobby, log on again for another 3h of free access and so on. If you try to log on whilst in your room, there's a charge. Strange? Yes.

Arrived at the airport and was told that W was the easiest hotel to get to from the airport. We took the express train and got off at the Kowloon station. We were told the hotel was above the station, but because of poor signage, it was not easy to find. Many we questioned not familiar with the property, because it was very new. After asking for directions, we finally reached the front entrance, then had to take an elevator to the lobby. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Once we reached our room, our baggage was delivered timely. The hotel is very modern and high tech, we had to call the front desk for instructions to operate the lights and few other things. They have system you see in European countries, where you have to insert your room key into the slot located near the door for all electrical needs. The room has very clean styling with large screen TV, hidden behind sliding mirror. Our room did not have the full harbor view, but partial. The very best Harbor view is still the Intercontinental, that is the ultimate for views. The hotel does provide free shuttles to Star Ferry Terminal and other destinations close by. Lots of constructions going on around the hotel. I did not see too much activities in their restaurants, except there was a wedding taking place. We searched for local cuisine all around town. 3 days were enough for us to see most of Hong Kong, including side-trip to Lamma Island. Make certain you bring your swim wear, because their pool on the 76th floor is the highest pool in town. Both pool and jacuzzi are infinity style and the view from jacuzzi is simply beautiful. Hotel driver delivered us to our ship, the Regent Mariner, right on the dock.

In any case, yes - the hotel was fabulous and very W-like. But for the price being charged I would have expected a real view and I didn't get that and I was ultimately really unhappy about that.

This is a very high tech modern hotel. The lighting designers deserves an A+. I WANT THE NAME OF THAT DESIGNER!!! The Spa was one of the nicest ones that I have seen.

The tub didn't have jets (but I wasn't in a suite). The dining room is fun. In the kitchen is a nice table where you can eat and watch them cook. I had a table with a view. The bar area also has a nice view and they also had a yummy continential breakfast served there. (It's NOT all you can eat, they charge you for each item.) The staff was so kind and helpful. Big Tip: The Hotel is actually at the Elements Mall. This is key to understand since it is a new hotel. In the Elements Mall is the airport check-in. Yes, I know it sounds odd but it is a very convenient service which makes the hotel a great location.

The \"Million-dollar view\" towards Central is completely blocked by the 101-storey skyscraper right in front of it. So the best harbour view is towards the west. The view towards the city on Kowloon side is more interesting. Everything in the room was an attempt to be \"cool\". Light controls just marked \"Day\", \"Sleep\", \"Evening\", iPod connectors, in-built surrounding sound system (that's awesome!). Although the room is equipped with blinds that block out all outside lights, these controls, be it the lights, emergency exit, telephone, all around the room actually light up the room much, which is a complete design failure. Didn't find staff to be especially helpful, as I was stuck outside the entrance because there was some hip party happening and they couldn't quite let me in...

Typical W bar with loud music. * Rooms: Very nice and almost \"too classical\" for W standards ! As usual in HKG, beautiful views. * Bathroom: Exceptional, with floor to ceiling windows, bath, rain shower and television. * Main Restaurant: Probably the most fabulous breakfast concept I have ever seen: The buffet is located in a \"real kitchen\", making you feel at home. * Restaurant \"Fire\"(Gourmet restaurant): Only white, black and deep red tones. Chief is from NZ and is serving truly innovative and tasty food. * Wet zone: Gym with two personal trainers, spa with terrific views on Kowloon, swimming-pool (infinity) on 76th floor. Absolutely stunning! * Staff: we could not fault any single person in 48 hours. Young, helpful, friendly. Simply \"W\" with a lot of warmth.
