This was my first time in Florence (Italy even) and the staff at the Hotel Collodi couldn't have been more kind and helpful! I arrived by taxi (realising later that I could have walked it easily from Santa Maria Novella, Florence's main train terminus with the one little roller suitcase I had - I think it defintely wouldn't be advisable if you have heavier suitcases, as the streets are cobbled and not very wide for both pedestrians and/or cars/bikes to pass). I was a bit late arriving to check-in as my flight had been delayed in London - but this was not an issue at the Hotel, who wecolmed me warmly which was just what this weary traveller needed!Once I'd got myself comfortable in my room/bathroom - which was beautiful, so clean and huge - I'd booked a single, but I'm assuming as it was still the low season, I was given a triple room - I decided to go out for my first taste of Florence. Giovanni, the hotel's manager gave me a complimentary map, even sketching out the route I should take that afternoon/evening to see the most - I was limited on time as I'd only come for two days and the advice he gave turned out to be invaluable, and I was able to make the most of what little time I had. Before I left for my first outing, I'd asked about finding out train times for my journey back to Pisa airport a few days later - and low and behold, a timetable was waiting for me, with the best time to leave Florence to catch my train to Pisa for my flight in good time hi-lighted - which they did not have to do - which really sums this hotel up - great personal customer service - and indeed, I didn't hear a bad word from any of the other guests - who were all enjoying their stay just as much as me.If you want to stay in an inexpensive, comfortable hotel, full of character with lovely, helpful staff, which is near to all the places of interest/sites in Florence then you should stay here at the Hotel Collodi - don't be put off by the number of stars - I don't think this does this charming little hotel any justice whatsoever. Oh yes, and it's in the heart of the San Lorenzo district, near the Mercato Centrale, and as other reviewers have pointed out, there are plenty of places to eat and drink if you want to stay local to the hotel for lunch/dinner, and this is something coming from me, as I was restricted to a vegetarian diet whilst in Italy (normally eat meat, but it needs to be Halal) - most places also do the menu in English and not just Italian too - but of course it's lovely to have a go at speaking/understanding such a beautiful language!Finally, I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank Giovanni and all his staff (Nadine and Giorgio are the ones I personally met) for all their help and kindness that made my stay in Florence even more special - I will definitely be staying at the Hotel Collodi again!", "Date": "Feb 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR457913550", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "britgirl72"}, {"Content": "Clean and inexpensive stay in Florence The Hotel Collodi is a small hotel located by the Mercato Centrale and very close to San Lorenzo. It was clean and comfortable and the staff was very nice and helpful. My husband and I stayed there in early October 2007. The location is great, being close to Santa Maria Novella train station , the Accademia and the Duomo. Florence is easy to walk around and we definitely enjoyed traveling by foot. We also enjoyed bargain shopping in the San Lorenzo market and the hotel was close so we could drop off our purchases. The neighborhood is safe, and there are lots of people walking by and eating at night especially with the Piazza del Mercato Centrale right there.The room (#402) faced the back of the hotel and was decently quiet. They include a continental breakfast. The staff is friendly and speak English well. They helped us figure out the train schedule (we went to Pisa for half a day and to Venice after our Florence stay) and recommended a great restaurant just a few yards away from the hotel, called Osteria Pepo (we liked it so much we went there for 2 nights in a row).We easily walked there from the train station (luggage - 1 small roller suitcase and 1 backpack each) but if you have large luggage, pulling it over the cobblestone streets may be difficult.The hotel staff made reservations for us at the Uffizi Gallery and the Accademia in advance without charge, which was very helpful. The reservations cost a little extra (3 Euro for each ticket which you pay to the museum when you buy your ticket) but they are sooo worth it if you don't want to lose precious hours in Florence standing in lines. I'm very glad we had the reservations and seeing David at the Accademia was definitely a major highlight in our trip.This hotel is safe, clean and comfortable with nice staff and breakfast included and in a great location. It was a great deal (114 Euro/night during the 1st week of October which is still peak season). Keep in mind that at this price, it is not a luxury hotel, but I definitely enjoyed my stay here. I would stay here again when visiting Florence.", "Date": "Oct 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR852521807", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "jmjo48"}, {"Content": "Great Hospitality We just wanted to say Thank you to the receptionist girl at Hotel Collodi. Our train from Venice was over an hour late, which got us to Florence after 10:00pm. We were so worried that our booking would be canceled or the doors would be locked when we got there. Luckily, she was still there awaiting for our arrival to check-in! This hotel was a wonderful find. Not on a busy street, close to several delicious restaurants, and not to mention the Central Market is only steps away! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Florence.

I think I can say this is one of the nicest hotels I've been in during my recent travels. The check-in was smooth even though we arrived a bit later in the evening. We were shocked when we got to our room. The room was HUGE even by American standards of measure. The bed was comfortable, linens were high quality, bath towels were superb. The bathroom was very nicely lit, spacious, and spotless. My only complaint is the breakfast. It was more like a pre-packaged affair rather than the good coffee and pastry/bread/meat we were used too elsewhere. Did I mention the size of the room...ok, one last time...HUGE! The location was great too although it took us a bit to find the hotel once we did, we found it convenient for everything we wanted to do.Even with a mix-up for our reservation we found the staff very helpful and appologetic.
