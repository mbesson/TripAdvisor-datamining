{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Beautiful vistas at this charming retreat! I highly recommend this beautiful hideaway to anyone traveling to Florence or Tuscany in general. The hosts are very friendly, and try very hard on their English.The views were breathtaking - it is incredible to stay in the countryside surrounded by such rustic charm.The rooms were clean and well-kept.It is a wonderful place to stay for a family since the rates are relatively low; we rented the entire house for not too much. It would also be ideal for a honeymoon as long as you pick the master suite. Otherwise you may have to share a bathroom with someone else, which I think hampers the romance a bit.The hosts will pick you up and take you to the train whenever you want to go into Florence. Otherwise you may want to rent a car to see the rest of the Tuscan countryside.YOU MUST go to the restaurant they recommend nearby, by far this restaurant (I forgot the name) has the best food I have ever had in my entire life, and I travel a lot.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR334099340", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d272547-r1257218-Vacanze_nel_Verde_La_Casellina-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "272547", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
