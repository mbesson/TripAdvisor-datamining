{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lovely hideaway in Bali I went to Bali and had a lovely time with my boyfriend staying at the Kusnadi hotel. Would recommend the deluxe room or penthouse (neither or which are 2 much more expensive than the cheaper rooms when you convert back into \u62e2 or $, but seem much more expensive in Rupiah!) Rooms are very clean and pleasant. The hotel staff were lovely and very kind towards us, breakfast was included and delicious. The hotel organised a transfer from the hotel, and we also booked the same driver for a tour of Bali. The pool is nice, but a day is much better spent at the beach which is about 5 mins walk away.", "Date": "Jun 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR157140281", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "1709"}, {"Content": "Authentic Balinese Hotel but 2 star       Outside Shower", "Date": "Jun 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR142049118", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "steve23"}, {"Content": "Nice place, good value, close to the shops etc I stayed at the Kusnadi for 3 nights in May 2008 in a Delux Room for 400,000 a night (approx \u62e222) for the two of us with breakfast, this is the normal rate. The hotel is nice, nice rooms, nice pool, nice restaurant, decent internet, good choice of (free) TV movie channels in the room if you fancy that. The location is great for the shops and restaurants/bars etc, only a few 100 yards to the nearest. It is fairly quiet and peaceful around the pool. The beach is only a few minutes walk away. This is one that I will visit again for the 'shopping' part of next years Bali holiday!", "Date": "May 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR501274722", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PMH2317"}, {"Content": "Fabulous for money       pool and pensions", "Date": "Dec 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR332792570", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "whiteout"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d799529-r17199064-Kusnadi_Hotel-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "799529", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
