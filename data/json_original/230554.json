Hotel is very convenient (5 minutes) to train station and buses and we felt very safe here. We often even walked to or from major attractions within 20-25 minutes and enjoyed wandering the neighborhoods. Staff was helpful and hotel was quiet and nice. Our double room had three beds (one double and two twins) a small refrigerator and TV, shower and bathroom and central air conditioning that was on all the time. Would definitely stay here again. Only critique was that breakfast was very light, with only dried packaged toast and croissants, jam and a bit of coffee in plastic cups. But there are cheap little shops just across the street and we kept juice and yogurt in our fridge to supplement breakfast. There is no internet but the peace, quiet, cleanliness and convenience made up for it. So much better than the hostel stay I had in Rome in my 20s! Perfect for people who want a convenient base for seeing Rome. It does not have hang out space, which probably helps it be quiet, and for those seeking that, I would recommend a hostel.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cIt has the basics\u201d", "Author": "Ande214", "ReviewID": "UR7956292", "Content": "Hotel Everest has your basic needs for a simple stay in Rome. It is a five minute walk from Termini (the train station), down Cavour, so that is convenient. The hotel is on the third floor of the building, so that was different. Take the elevator to the third floor if there are only two of you because no one else will fit. We walked up all the stairs upon our arrival b/c we didn't know it was on the third floor. The hotel staff provided us with a map when we arrived and pointed out all the bus routes and major sites to see, so that was helpful. The room is very basic, the bathroom is simple and there is not a view. We had trouble with the water going down in the shower, the toilet flushing, and the blow dryer does not have a whole lot of power (if that is something that you would use). Breakfast is also very basic. It had some things we couldn't identify in wrappers, some bread, and coffee and juice. We could pay with credit card though when we checked out, unlike I read in a different review. All in all, it is clean and a place to sleep if you are going to be out all day exploring Rome and do not care a whole lot about your bathroom amenities or breakfast.", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cConveniently Situated Budget Hotel\u201d", "Author": "LeedsTravelBug", "ReviewID": "UR7331012", "Content": "We have just returned from a great trip to Rome, staying at the Hotel Everest 1. We've stayed at a budget hotel in the city before so we sort of knew what to expect and we weren't disappointed. The location is excellent for people arriving at Termini train station/bus from Ciampino airport as it's no more than 5 mins walk to the hotel, convenient when carrying luggage. The hotel is 3 floors up so I recommend taking the lift when you first arrive and not attempting to walk up with all your luggage, like i did! The room is basic but what do you need whan you're out sight seeing - you don't go to Rome to sit in your room all day. It was was clean, comfortable and the bathroom was of an adequate size for two sharing. Fresh towels were provided daily. The view wasn't great - we were overlooking washing lines but that didn't bother us. Breakfast was simple, pastries with a choice of hot drinks and juice, plenty to start a day touring the city. Staff were very friendly on arrival, giving us plenty of information about the major attractions and advice about the metro. The only downside was on checking out, they hadn't taken the correct details about our payment on arrival (which must be in cash only when you arrive). We had to speak to the receptionist that had booked us in on the mobile phone of the receptionist on duty. Luckily he remembered us. Keep your receipt as proof when checking out!

The room had enough space for 2 suitcases (although the bathroom was very narrow) and was not cramped. It was cleaned every day and kept in very good condition. One thing we were worried about when we booked the hotel was that it was on one of the busiest roads in Rome, but we actually found that in our room we couldn't hear the roads at all! The room faced away from the room but we had no noise at all. Breakfast was basic but nice and was all that we wanted - hot drinks or juice and pastries that were fresh, toast, marmalades, etc. Security was never a concern as the hotel is on 3rd floor (there is a lift though), and the street is well-lit.
