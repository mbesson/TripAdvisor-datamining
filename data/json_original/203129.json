The buffet breakfast was typical for the type of Hotel and more than what we required. The room was tidied everyday, with clean towels being provided. Interent was available and the Wi-Fi worked fine in the room. Termini station is about 15 mins walk and the nearest metro 5 mins from the Hotel. There is a great choice of restauraunts (at least 15-20) all within an easy 10 min walk, which suited us after a hard day sightseeing. The nearest is directly across the street where we found the staff very friendly and spoke english well. There is a local bar right next door open till 3 a.m. which we did use and whilst we were roomed on the first floor (102) certainly never heard any noise.

We booked through Thomas Cook and could not have had a better time! We arrived in the afternoon after a slight delay on our flight, and were greeted by a very friendly gentlemen who spoke English very well, which was a relief as my italian is limited! He took our details, and sorted out our room within seconds. He directed us to our room, and informed us of breakfast timings and location. Before travelling i emailed the hotel in order to request a room on a high floor with a balcony. We were given room 608. On a high floor and with a balcony, just what we asked for!! The room was of adequate sizing.....its not like we spent much time in the room with all the sights to see! The bed in the room as amazing! was definately bigger than a normal double bed, maybe king sized? me and my partner always slept well and spread out as much as we wanted without kicking each other, which is what usually happens! The bathroom was generously sized also, with plenty of towels and toiletries provided. Breakfast was good with a range of pastries, cereals, fruit, yoghurts, and a small amount of hot food. on our third day we needed to phone up to confirm our private transfer to the airport at the end of the stay. I was nervous about this because as previously mentioned, i am not the best at speaking italian! I went to reception with all the details and asked if it was possible for them to confirm my booking for me. The gentlemen on reception was extremely helpful, took the paperwork and promptly phoned up while we waited, confirming our booking and giving us a pick time also. When we returned later from sight seeing and collected our key from reception, i was given an envelope, which contained email confirmation from the transfer company which the hotel had printed out for me. Check out was easy and painless also. As our flight was an evening flight, we checked out at 12 and the hotel was happy to look after our luggage whilst we finished souvenir shopping. We found the hotel to be perfectly situated. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, including Mama Angelas which is well worth a visit! it is located about a 10 minute walk from the termini, which is close enough for sight seeing, yet does not affect the hotel in terms of noise. The hotel is in an area which is not too busy and is unaffected by traffic noise, apart from the ambulance sirens, which i think you'd hear no matter where you stayed in Rome! Overall i would not hesitate to stay at the Villafranca again, and am hoping to stay here again next year!", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby", "Title": "\u201cNo hesitation in recommending the Villafranca\u201d", "Author": "TraveladdictDerby", "ReviewID": "UR125674452", "Content": "Our 3 night stay coincided with my birthday and we were welcomed on arrival with a bottle of bubbly.

However, all we really needed was a base and breakfast so it was not a problem and the bed was very comfortable - we slept better than at home! The shower, though, was really very cramped and had no shelf inside for toiletries which would have been a help. The hotel is easy to find and only a short walk from the Termini station. There are a number of eateries nearby of varying standards and price (we would particularly recommend Il Leone d'Abruzzo) and it is not too long a walk to most of the major attractions of this wonderful city. Reception staff were helpful and the hotel itself is clean and modern, although the lifts often go up and down a few times while you wait to keep up with demand. Our room was at the front on the second floor (so we didn't use the lifts that much) - I imagine that in high season it could be quite noisy from street sounds but was not too bad at this time of year. The spread for breakfast was wide and varied but not topped up that well - they serve between 7am and 10am but if you are any later than around 9am the food starts to run out and not be replaced. The breakfast area is also quite small and on Sunday morning, when everyone was getting ready to eat and check out, there were not enough tables at some points. Hot and cold foods - scrambled egg, sausage and bacon, cold meats and cheeses, toast and bread, rolls, cakes and biscuits, fresh and tinned fruit, yoghurt, cereals, coffees etc from machines, and fruit juices. Enough to keep you going without lunch! The room was clean and fresh towels were provided every day if needed. The bedside drawers did contain items from the previous occupants and there are not really enough drawers if you are there for more than a few days. However it did seem that we had the smallest room on the floor so perhaps other rooms have more storage space.

We were given rooms 701 and 703 which were on the very top floor. 701 was overlooking the side of building with a very small balcony, but the views were pretty of rooftops. One issue for the room is the shower which is only a mixer tap over the bath and was faulty so we basically had to stand holding the shower head for the entire time making washing my hair very difficult. Another issue with the hotel was I could not get wifi at all in my room despite reception telling me I should. Was a bit frustrating as I'd taken my iPad to keep in touch back home but wifi worked in and around reception and the bar so wasn't the end of the world. We we checked in by Marco and Ameliano who pretty much manned reception thought our stay. They were great, very friendly, spoke excellent English and always happy to help us with our questions. We were unfortunately there for the snow and being a freezer I mentioned I was a little cold. Within ten minutes we were given extra blankets which was much appreciated. There is a barman there called Chokan who I have to tell you is fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble day or night for him and was always very accommodating. The friendliness of the staff are in my opinion what makes this hotel a great stay. Chokans friendliness was what made our stay so very warm and welcoming. We used the bus from the airport which goes directly from the airport to the termini. It was then a good five minute walk to the hotel. The colleseum was about 30 minutes away walking and as all the tour busses travel via the termini it does make the hotel a fairly good spot. We also found even when we went walking and got lost, being right by the termini was a good landmark to head back to. Breakfast is really good with cereals, toast meats and a few pastries. You can also have a fresh coffee made free of charge at breakfast if you ask. Breakfast was so good we only needed an evening meal as it kept us going on day. We didn't get to see everything and we truly fell in love with Rome so fully intend on going back and in all probability we would use this hotel again. I would ask for a different room though as the lower rooms did have much bigger balconies and hopefully the wifi works better. The only other thing we would have liked was a few more English channels on the tv as BBC World news or CNN, which were the only choices got a little boring but that's just a niggle as we didn't really go on holiday to watch tv.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poole", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, good location\u201d", "Author": "tollyg", "ReviewID": "UR124390012", "Content": "Great location for a sight seeing trip to Rome as close to Termini station and metro.

Unfortunately they installed dark blue carpet and painted the walls a dark maroon colour. As a result the place is poorly lit and looks dark and dirty. To make matter worse they also installed a sensor light just as you enter the room right next to the bathroom. Of course if someone got up in the night to go to the toilet, the light turned on.

Fair enough. But some points will have to be worked on a little harder. The room was fairly clean and tidy upon arrival, but not as much the next day. For instance, we had requested tea and coffee making facilities in the room (which took a while to be obtained, but nevermind) and the next day when we returned we found that the set was exactly as we had left it, with dirty cups and a half a jug of milk that at that time of the day smelled sour (by the way, we would have put it in the minibar to be used on our second night had the minibar been working...). The heating in the room was not working 100%, but we managed to obtain a reasonable temperature. We were not as lucky in the bathroom, which had no heating element, at least that we could see.

There are some good restaurants within walking distance which was nice. The hotel itself is not attractive. The rooms are very small and the hotel is very basic which is expected at a Best Western. The worst thing about this place was the front desk. There was a stocky guy with dark hair and a light beard and mustache who was a complete jerk. We would ask for a cab while he was on his cell phone so he put down his phone did something on the computer and walked into the backroom to continue his conversation without saying a word. This guy needs to go. The young girl with the glasses wasn't as bad but was still a very poor employee. You definitely get what you pay for with this place.

The first thing I will say about this hotel is that when the taxi driver dropped us off, I had second thoughts. The hotel facade is tiny, the lobby dark and small. The desk clerk was in the middle of doing something and did not seem happy to stop for us. This hotel, however, did have vending machines and ice available (what you would expect in the USA) and was able to assist with a last minute tour booking. The breakfast was good but you have to hope you can get a seat. Internet is 10 euros/day. The restaurant outside (Oasies Pub Birreria) is very nice and cheap and we had a good meal. However, at night, this hotel is VERY noisy and we did not sleep well at all. The room is tiny (we practically crawled over each other) and the bathroom is even smaller (if you drop the soap in the shower you probably could not bend down to pick it up unless you were skinny).Perhaps if you are traveling with another adult, on a strict budget and do not mind the closeness of the other hotels across the street and the visible garbage this may be the place for you.

There was often a queue for breakfast and the dishes where the hot food was kept were often empty, due to their very small size. The rooms were nicely furnished but extremely chlostrophobic even for a city hotel. The bed was quite stiff and the air con made a constant irritating noise and was poised in such a position that it had no benefit to cooling the cramped room down. The bathroom was adequate, no bath, but a small shower which gave you no room atall to move around in. You had to step out of the shower in order to rub shampoo into your head, meanwhile the water temperature was temperamental.

The hallways on each floor were the same: carpet that had been vacuumed, but was still dirty. Molding that was new, but falling off. Paint that wasn't old, but no scratches were covered up, so it looks, well, just kind of cheap. The hallways are DARK. Little motion detectors set off the hallway lights while you walk down them. OK, that's weird, but I'm ok with it. We got in the room and it was dark.... and none of the lights worked. Luckily, the maid was out in the hall and explained that we had to stick this little key into this hole in the wall to enable all the lights.

Wow, they sure weren't kidding!. Oddly, they weren't evenly hard... Oooohhh, it was because we actually were on two twin beds that were pushed together and held there with the sheets. Nice. I work over the internet, so the first thing I did was to pop that network cable in and check my.... oops, no connection. I read the little instructions, \"turn on the TV and choose internet\", ok, I can do that.... oops... I can't. Power doesn't do anything. After pounding on the remote for a while I get about 10 TV channels, but nothing else. Pretty soon I called the front desk and was told I needed a code. So, I paid 10 euro and got a few letters and a number to enter.... somewhere, they just kept telling me it will be \"right there\". OK, it wasn't. After about 20 minutes I finally had them send someone up. About 30 minutes later he arrived - and couldn't fix it. He finally said, I'll be back in 2 minutes. It wasn't until I told the receptionist to make me a reservation at a different hotel and that I wasn't paying for current day that I actually got service. Suddenly the, \"I'm sorry sir, but I've called the main office in Milan and only got a busy signal - it's not my fault\", changed to \"Here's a key to a new room with Internet that works.\" total of 3 hours of begging. Other than that: the shower head kept falling off on me, but the pressure was great. The bright lights wouldn't turn off in our entry-way... annoying. The temperature in our room was great, but my friends had to move because their heater was stuck on. (Oh, and the water coming from their faucet suddenly turned brown. Nice) All in all: Location: decent Cleanliness: decent Responsiveness: decent The brown water thing was kind of gross. The internet thing was extremely annoying. The twin beds pushed together (in our new room I had to do it myself!) odd. I'd never recommend it.

For Irish guests reading this, the sausages at breakfast are the german variety and not the galtee type!! and the egg is hot but more like a scrambled omlette..also cake and pastries a little odd at 7a.m but as they say \" when in Rome\" .....so go ahead and eat them...delicious.... Asked for room with terrace when I booked with Booking.com and was given one on arrival. Room was on 6th floor, quiet street below..Check in was fast and smooth. When guests asked advice on excursions/restaurants etc they got the information from staff at front desk. Lots of maps and leaflets lying around anyway. Hotel is more like a B&B. It is old in places if you take the time to look around , but too much to see and do in Rome to be concerned as to the appearance of the paintwork!! We ate breakfast at 7 a.m and left hotel each day at 8.30 a.m we returned at 1a.m each morning!!!! so not much time spent there. Hotel is a few streets from Termini Station so very handy for the Ryanair Terravision bus to and from the airport. Didn't find the area near Termini to be dangerous at night and it is very busy with tourists throughout the day. Plenty of police about anyway. Hotel room had bath and shower , the room was cleaned each day, sheets changed and toiletries replaced. Bath was fab for a soak after long day walking about. Hot water was always available and shower was great. Room had mini bar...we didn't like that , as it was open when we arrived and two or four items missing, we went down and got reception to make a note of it. It was bothering us the whole stay that we would be charged for stuff we didn't take, so make a check when you arrive and sort it out with staff. Air conditioner was noisey and when we rang down to reception at 1.30.am to ask them to switch it off and they did right away. The old man on night reception is gruff and moody ,but that is just his personality, depends on how you approach him I guess. He got us a kettle and teabags (couldn't find any milk!) at 1.30 a.m when we came in from walking around and we had nice cup of tea before sleeping!!! So he not bad in the end!! In the room service book it says service available 24 hours a day , but not so, kitchen and bar close at 11.30/midnight. A good mix of ages and nationalities staying at hotel. Taxi can be called from front desk and is 8 to 10 euro to get to Trevi Fountain or Piazza Navona...we did this on one evening when it was pouring rain..... We walked the hotel stairs one day just to see the other corridors and yes, I think they were renovated, new doors ,carpets etc,, Overall well worth the money for what we got,basic ,clean and did the job.. I would not have been happy to pay anymore than we did. Reception staff in daytime may need a course on customer relations and be a little more welcoming and chatty.

Overall, the trip went fine until we were about to check out from this filthy hotel at 7am. I had a similar experience with the person who reviewed this hotel before me. The staff was still sleeping on a couch in front of the bar. As we approached the front desk, which is located nearby the bar, this staff got up, but his appearance seemed to me of a person who just got up from falling asleep drunk in front of the bar. Not realizing he was the staff, I rang the bell at the front desk, and the guy gave me this cruel look and yelled something at me I couldn't understand, but was pretty sure it meant something mean. That's when I realized he was the staff. He then gave me a piece of paper and said nothing. I had to ask him whether I was all set and he said yes. That was it and he didn't even say goodbye. What a great way to leave a strong impression of the city. All along, I had the feeling that the staff wanted me to feel guilty of waking him up. I would've had a better impression of Rome if I'd just left the keys on the front desk and left silently. The room I stayed in had a small bedroom and a bathroom as big as that bedroom. So they located the closet inside the bathroom. The towels didn't smell clean, there was no shower curtain and the hair dryer attached to the wall was totally busted. Before I came to Rome, I visited Paris and stayed at a hotel that was even smaller, but the staff there were quite friendly and humorous, which made our stay much more pleasant than at Rome. I didn't really expect much from such a cheap hotel, but at the time when I was choosing a hotel before my travel, I thought Best Western, having at least a brand name would've at least trained their staff to be a bit courteous.

My stay of 4 days was so great that I when I arrived to my \u2018upgraded\u2019 hotel by the Coliseum a few days later, I was disappointed by comparison. I stayed during the last week of 2006. First the pros\u2026 It was walking distance from Termini Station, but my wife did not know that at the time. We took a taxi from the stand, NOT the guys who ask you if you need a taxi (Note: After arriving, we asked the front desk the average cost for a taxi \u2013 they said should not be more than 15 Euro). Upon arriving, the staff was friendly and inviting. As we opened the room door, we were impressed to find that the room was recently renovated. Albeit a small room, it did not feel like it. In fact, it felt like quite the opposite. Our room also had a large in room safe and access to the mini bar. Rather than use the items in the mini-bar, we went to the local supermarkets (PAM and Supermarketini) \u2013 both are only a few steps away from the hotel. Why pay 2.30 for a coke when you can purchase a six pack for the same price? Bonus: Breakfast is included with the hotel. If you\u2019ve been to Europe, you\u2019re probably aware that you could easily spend up to 10 Euro for your first morning meal. It was delightful to have the same items offered at no cost. The breakfast is you typical eggs, ham, cheese, breads, cereals and morning drinks. Now the cons\u2026 Only one key was available for the room. If you need to leave the room, you turn off all power to the room. If you are in the room, there is a little light outside each room to indicate that you are inside. Although we left the \u2018do not disturb\u2019 on the door, our room was cleaned because the light was out. The only internet access is available via dialup. This was not a big problem because there are several internet access terminals near the hotel that will allow you to utilize there computers for 2 Euro per hour. There is not an ice maker in the hotel, but the bartender will provide you some at no cost. Summary: We fell in love with this place and would go back in a New York minute.

The hotel is perfectly located a short walk from the termini station which is great for getting to and from the airport and also for the buses and metro service. The metro is great for value at 1 euro per trip but we did find that no matter what time of the day you got on it was crammed full. The sightseeing buses are brilliant for seeing all the sites as you can hop on and off but allow yourself a full day or its a waste of money. There are loads of restaurants near by but if your not sure where to go the reception will make you a reservation at one of there customers favourites!
