The rooms were what I expected--small, smelly, loud and slightly unclean. The complementary breakfast is a cheap muffin and watered down coffee. What was most upsetting is the way in which the manager treated me as a customer, even stating at one point \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the customer does not count that the owner is always right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Having paid the additional $8 for parking, I was continually inconvenienced by being requested to move my car so that they could fit maximum number of vehicles in the lot by double parking. If you are traveling on a budget there are better deals out there. I would never stay at this hotel again!", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Canada", "Title": "\u201cClean, simple and plain\u201d", "Author": "BloggerYKT", "ReviewID": "UR127353613", "Content": "The place is basic, very very basic but it is inexpensive. Essentially, you get what you pay for. It is a very simple, no frills place. The walls are thin, there was no desk in the room I had, there was a clothes rack instead of a closet, and the breakfast was pretty basic. But is it inexpensive. I wanted a clean place and a private bathroom and I got that. The sheets were clean, there were no bed bugs, I had a small but very functional bathroom and the hosts were pleasant. The location is great if you are going to use public transportation. It is a 3 minute walk to a subway station.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location for Summertime festivities.\u201d", "Author": "1956agjl", "ReviewID": "UR117772501", "Content": "We booked it online; expected it wouldn't be a 4 or 5 star hotel, and got what we expected. The entrance carpet should be replaced/cleaned, but the staff were friendly, accommodating, the room was tidy and tiny - specially the bathroom, but at least we didn't have to share it with other visitors. I got to meet other people from Paris and Poland while having breakfast (blueberry muffins and croisants). The dining area has 1 table and max 5 chairs.

Since a good portion of Ste. Catherine Street is closed to vehicles in summer, getting your car to this hotel can be a bit of a challenge as we came to find out. We were told we had \"the biggest room in the hotel\" with 2 double beds. To me, that's a standard size hotel room, but as this is a B&B, you have to adjust your sizing expectations. Yes, the room was a decent size with a private bathroom. And for the most part, the room was clean. There were a few cobwebs and the bathroom could have been a bit cleaner, but no big deal. The room looked out on Ste. Catherine Street which was alive until 3 am, but we heard no noise when we were ready to sleep. There is a continental breakfast served in the mornings, which we found out about too late -- so be sure to ask. The front desk guys are very friendly and are willing to give you info on what to see in the city and when to see them. Watching TV was a challenge as all channels were snowy -- but who is inside watching TV anyway? I think we paid $99/night plus tax, which seemed a bit pricey, but you are getting a great location, especially for nightlife. Parking is available behind the building for $10/day when space permits. You may be blocked in or be blocking someone in, so talk to the front desk guy for direction. Also wifi is available for no charge.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, NY", "Title": "\u201cStay ANYWHERE But Here\u201d", "Author": "evguy422", "ReviewID": "UR58986394", "Content": "Without a doubt the most disgusting hotel I have ever seen. My boyfriend and I were looking for a cheap stay for our 10 day visit and didn't expect luxury by any means. We are from New York and know that some places can be shabby but worth it for the price difference. Not this place. We couldn't find it because we were looking for a place like pictures on the website and that did not exist. We got to the room and next to ours was a sketchy guy who had beer cans falling out of his room door. We went in and there were guys phone numbers written on the wall. The place was so gross we decided to inspect for bed bugs. When we lifted the mattress there was a pair of dirty boxers stuffed underneath. The free internet they advertised didn't work, so we took our laptops down the street to a cafe to look for another place. We booked it and went back to tell them we wouldn't be staying. The guy argued he had to charge us $55 for a full night even though we had been there for under an hour. After threatening to call the police (which he didn't seem to want considering there were probably prostitutes in the place) he gave us a full refund and cursed at us as we left with our bags. Went Hotel Ste. Andre and was MUCH happier.", "Date": "March 19, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Ste Catherine", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d1377689-Reviews-Hotel_Ste_Catherine-Montreal_Quebec.html", "Price": "$55 - $104*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1674 Ste Catherine Est</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Montreal</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Quebec</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">H2L 2J4</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1377689", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c0/69/c069c61275ef9c9b7c55e03c383833d34large.jpg"}}
