The folks upstairs sound like they were bouncing off the walls, but when we checked they were simply walking around. You can hear the water turn on when someone showered, and the toilets flush. We were lucky that they were on the same timetable as us, and not rambunctious. Otherwise, this would have been a major issue. The location for the resort is a bit out of the way if you are in San Diego as a tourist. The beaches are a good half hour away (La Jolla is the closest).

Finally I was told the people above us had been moved, and it got a little more quiet that evening, but it seemed as if the same folks were back the next night. The hotel staff was very understanding but told me there was little they could do as they weren't staffed to properly handle the number of unruly guests they had at the hotel these two evenings. Unfortunately, my wife got very sick while we were there(not due to the noise), but the staff was, again, very helpful and the restaurant even prepared chicken soup for her even though it wasn't on the menu. It was extremely hard to get around the noise on this stay. It was very nearly unceasing. I'm not at all sure why the hotel would allow this sort of thing to go on to such a degree.

The only negative about the room was the fact that in all of the smaller buildings detached from the mail building, the air conditioner is low to the floor and in the corner, pointing at the bed. This means that the corner of the room between the bed and wall is very cold, but the rest of the room is not cooled. The air conditioner should be high so the cool air gets a chance to circulate. We had the breakfast buffet included with our stay, which was nice to wake up to. It consisted of the standard eggs, potatoes, cereals, pastries, and fruit. I missed the Belgian waffle station, however, since the waffles were clearly frozen and simply warmed up and put on a heated tray. They ended up hard and inedible. The free cookies at the lobby were good, and we took one every time we walked through.

The villas have little patios and are very large. The flat screen tv has a great picture and the furniture is great. I would not stay in a couple of the villas as they are near the busy street or the patio looks onto another unit. Building 5, 4 and 2 looked the best by far!! The pool was great, and ordered a cocktail delivered by someone from the Mulligans Pub. We ate there that night and they had very good food. Pub food, soup, etc. It was overlooking the golf course. Of course it was dark so not much to see but when the suns still up it is probably nice. All the employees from security to the operator, to the maids were great.

We would have liked a refrigerator and microwave in the room, but when we requested a fridge from the front desk, they brought one right up. We are already planning to return soon. The suburban location is just off 1-15 and only 20 minutes from all of the attractions of San Diego. Or its less than 20 minutes from the beach. A large mall is only 5 minutes away and there are many restaurants and other shops nearby.

Stayed in one of the Villa rooms. Had an adjoining room with the friend I was traveling with. We had both gotten similar room packages, but my room was much nicer, which didn't make her feel too to good. I had a wet bar, with fridge instead of a desk, and my room had a separate vanity with sink, that hers didn't have. I was very pleased. Bedding very comfortable, room clean, loved flat screen TV. Carpet was worn and fraying where it met the floor and could use replacement. Biggest problme was noise from room above me. Forturnately , I only someone above me for one of the three nights. Every single footsetp could be heard in the creaking floor above me! They arrived back to their room at 1 am and stayed up till 3 am. And they didn't sit still. Before they went to sleep, I even go to hear the headboard banging and moaning. Was really a grim night. I can't believe what I heard. I was also not a fan of the $9 self parking charge. Breakfast buffet was ok, not spectacular and it was the exact same items every morning. No change at all. Got sick of it by day 3. Staff in both the bar and restaurant were very friendly, as was the front desk staff. Golf course package was a good value, and the course is nice, but not a gorgeous top resort course; however, I wasn't paying for gorgeous top resort course. Play on the course is VERY SLOW, which frustrates me. The first day we arrived, we had a 1:04 tee time. On Hole #2, there were four groups waiting!! That's absurd. Very rarely did we see a ranger to keep play moving alone. Day 2 and 3, we had 10 am tee times and both days, our rounds lasted just under 5 hours. That's way too long. The course is pretty, has some challenges, but is playable. It is, however, immediately adjacent to the highway and it's very loud. Was hard to hear my golfing partner during some holes. All in all, good trip for the money spent.

The pool and hot tub were relaxing and warm, which was much appreciated during this unusally cold, frosty & snowy February day in SanDiego. The front desk staff and other hotel staff were friendly, not high on the knowlegeable/helpful factor...but nice. Since it was so cold we were looking for indoor alternate options for fun, and hotel staff seriously had no concept of how to help. Luckily for us, it warmed up the next day.

I was intrigued by the pictures on the web and by the amenities offered. I decided to spend a few more dollars a night to stay at this \"resort\" instead of your standard road side hotel. The rate I booked actually was not very expensive in my opinion. At first when we arrived I was a little disappointed. Because we didn't arrive until night we got put in an outlying building right on top of the main road/highway. Not to mention with 3 kids it was a little hike to get to the room with all of our luggage too. Having said that, we called down to the front desk to ask about our location. The staff was very friendly and helpful and explained that the hotel was completely booked but that they would move us to a different room in the morning. In the morning we left all of our things packed up and the staff moved our luggage while we were out at the parks. When we got back to the room, we were happy to see we had a much better location with no road noise and a view of nice landscaping and the pool. The hotel itself is huge and is set up almost like an apartment complex. There are walkways that lead to your own entrance to your room. Our room had 2 queen beds, a sitting area, a balcony, and a nice bathroom with 2 sinks. The room was a good size; with plenty of room for all of our kids, a roll away, a pack and play, and all of our luggage we were still able to move around comfortably. The beds are extremely comfortable and they even give you warm cookies when you check in. They have a nice heated pool and a jacuzzi area that my kids loved spending time in after a day at the parks. There is also a fitness area, another lap pool, onsite restaurant and a golf course but we didn't use any of that. As far as the location, it is a bit away from major attractions (about 25 minutes to Sea World, 30 minutes to the zoo and downtown), but in my opinion, well worth it! The room and hotel itself were nice enough that we actually wanted to spend time there.

Nevertheless, on Labor day weekend, there was at least one wedding reception being catered, there was golf being played on the hotel's associated 18-hole course, and there were sun-worshippers in two different swimming pools. And since it was also 100 degrees most of the weekend, many were inside with their air-conditioning cranked up. It's a very quiet place -- everyone seems to respect everyone else's privacy. The layout of the grounds is unusual. First off there is a lodge of modern construction where you can room if you choose. Then there are 20 small two-story villa-like buildings -- each one divided into either six or eight suites--each suite with its own entrance door. One reviewer below was correct that if your villa is located far from the parking lots, you have quite a way to cart your luggage. Also, the villas have no elevators, so if your suite is on the second floor, you also cart your luggage up the steps (that's very European!). By the way, parking here is $8 a night -- more if you require a valet. My suite appears to have been closed up for some time and smelled musty, so I invested in a bottle of Fabreze at a local convenience store which took care of the problem. Otherwise, everything seemed to be in working order. There was an extensive room-service menu in my room, but I wound up eating out every night -- there are excellent restaurants in several nearby shopping centers.

When I asked for them the next day, they gave me one and had an awful time locating the second. The staff, especially Elani at the front desk, was rude and seemed like I was putting them out by asking them to do their job. To top off all the rudeness, they messed up my bill and I had to call back after I checked out to get a receipt with the correct amount that was charged to my card faxed to me.

Our room was located in Villa 11, Room 415. The ground floor room was nicely decorated in soft natural colors. Two comfy wing back type chairs, small table, work station, very comfortable bed with nice linens. I especially liked the wooden shutters over the windows. It gave the room a homey feel...not just a 'hotel' room. The sliding glass doors opened up to a small semi-private patio area where we watched little bunnies hop around and eat. And, of course, we had the golf course grassy area right there. Those with small children might enjoy these rooms. As others have noted, the walls are a bit thin. Our neighbors to the left and right were not noisy, but we did notice they were there..nothing terrible though. It wouldn't stop us from going back. We arrived at about 9:30am and we truly were surprised that our room was ready...that's a first!
