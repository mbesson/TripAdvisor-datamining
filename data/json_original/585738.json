On arrival I was given a room on the 2nd floor with balcony facing Kent Street. The 2nd floor had almost 8 studio rooms and the worst part of the rooms is it has a very small kitchen that too in the passage which leads to the studio room. Also it's not very airy and it gets a noisy at times especially during weekends. If you want to stay there please prefer booking rooms on Higher floor as I with another colleague moved on 23rd floor in a 2 bedroom room and since we were sharing the rent we paid less than what we were paying individually for the 'Dungeon' studio room downstairs. Also the gym is waste has only one threadmill and a few other equipments. The ppl at the reception are good and helpful though.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cTerrible Customer service\u201d", "Author": "yerrics", "ReviewID": "UR63891067", "Content": "When we checked in, we were charged 100$ as holding deposit, which is fine, but they never release it even after 2 weeks.

And they have the nerve to say that even though everything is fine with the accomodation and charges during the stay, they still reserve the right to charge the guest credit card after 2 months.

It was OK, but not really a 4 star property. Room maintenance was a problem with broken fixtures, furniture falling apart, and general shoddy quality throughout. Internet access was a very bad value: $27 / day, and you only get 100MB of data transfer. After that, it's $0.10 / MB. I ended up paying $40-50 / day for Internet access and I hardly used it at all. It was covered by my company as a business expense, but it was still a terrible price and I would have been furious had I been paying out of my own pocket. The location is OK, but a little far away from the action.

We stayed in a two bedroom apartment and to its credit the rooms were quite good and there were two good sized bathrooms. However, if you want to sleep in - forget it! Our curtains were translucent and it seemed as if it was actually darker with them open. Unless you were used to sleeping in direct light, then you were up at sunrise! I am sure they do not get many requests for a late checkout. Also, there was no FOXTEL, which you would expect to be standard in a hotel of this type. No room service or any other form of guest service was available either. The pool, spa and sauna are also relatively mediocre and we were interrupted in a sauna session by the desk staff because we dripped water from the pool to the sauna. I had the feeling that this establishment prefers to cater for its permanent residents rather than hotel guests. A good position to Darling Harbour, but I will not be staying again; because at this price I am convinced that there is much, much better in the competitive Sydney market.", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ukraine", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place To Stay\u201d", "Author": "Dikie", "ReviewID": "UR8520006", "Content": "I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Oak Trafalgar Apartments.

Coffee plunger etc in kitchen and good washing machine/dryer. Bathroom with shower and big bath. Every detail had been attended to so as to make good facilities available.

This property is set up for long stay & not equipped for the short stay guest. BOOKING The booking was made on a third party website. ARRIVALS/DEPATURES On arrival into Sydney we took the train from Sydney airport to Wynyard station (same line from the airport). It is a 5 minute walk (no stairs for those with luggage) to the hotel on the corner of Kent & King Streets in the city. From the airport one-way by train was approximately AUD$12 per person. Check in is from 1400, we arrived at 1300 and were given our room keys early. The ferry can also be taken a 2 minute walk away (from Kings Wharf or Darling Harbour) to Circular Quay. Tickets are just over $5 per person one way. RECEPTION In comparison to hotels this reception is designed for the long stay guest. The service by reception is basic & not professional. Two examples, when asked for a do not disturb sign, at first there was not one available then an old one was located it was taped up as it had been ripped & then handed to us. Secondly when asked to book a taxi the number was written down on a piece of paper and given to us. ROOMS We stayed in a studio on the 5th floor. The studio is long and narrow. A small balcony faced Kent St. The bathroom is generous in size, step into bathtub/shower which needed a good clean (mould present), basin, toilet, washing machine & dryer. Sachets of powder are provided for the washing machine. The kitchen was left dirty; pots, cutlery, plates & glasses were all dirty, we loaded up the dishwasher & used the powder provided to wash them. The lamp on the bedside table had no light bulbs & hair left throughout the apartment. The bedding and couches full of dust. Instead of feeling relaxed we wanted to clean everything we had to touch. Housekeeping hours are from 0900 to 1600 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not guest friendly hours. FACILITIES Twenty meter heated indoor swimming pool, spa & sauna, gymnasium are on site. High speed & security lift access & tour booking facilities. We only made use of the elevators as after the state of the apartment we could only imagine the cleanliness of communal facilities. AREA The location is very convenient to the CBD & shops, Darling Harbour and is a short walk to the Rocks. There is a 7/11 convenience store open 24hrs around the corner & a good selection of supermarket/bottle shop/grocer items (literally the A \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Z of any food or drink) available from David Jones Department store (5 min walk).", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NZ", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "nzuk", "ReviewID": "UR5495397", "Content": "This should be a great place to stay. The two bedroomed apartment we had was a good size and well equipped. The beds were very comfortable. However although we had specified at booking the bedding configuration we required no notice had been taken. It was easily fixed by unzipping one double to make two singles but the extra sheets required were on the sofa bed and they had been used. Luckily washing machine and drier worked brilliantly. Could not say the same for the dishwasher and waste disposal unit. We put in a maintenance request for these but they were not attended to during the whole week of our stay. A lot of other minor maintenance was due. Broken furniture, blinds. The carpet was stained and the kitchen floor was black. We had to wash all the kitchen dishes before we felt we could use them.
