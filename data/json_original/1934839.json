Our window wouldn't lock and one call to maintenance had it sorted. Nice flat screen tv with satellite but its all im Italian. . . Not sure what else i expected!! The breakfast was cereal, toast, yogurt, cheese, ham and boiled eggs. Tea and coffee. The staff during breakfast were also very friendly. We arrived late Saturday night so decided to eat in the restaurant for ease, my chicken was served raw. Not a tiny bit under cooked but straight up raw!!! It was sent back to the kitchen only to come back microwaved within an inch of its life. . . You know chicken is microwaved cus it goes ultra white and floppy. That was also taken away only to be replaced by a nice veal in red wine sauce. . . Too little too late though. When we got to Rome the main things we wanted from the break was some tasty Italian food so our first meal was such a let down. We didn't eat there again because i didn't want to spend the rest of our break on the can!!! Location wise the hotel is a 20 min walk to the tube line which means when you go out early morning to head to the city by the time its late evening we couldn't be bothered to go back to the hotel to freshen up and change before having dinner due to it taking nearly an hour to get back to the hotel. Only a small gripe though because it means you get more time out seeing the stunning city.

It was no more than a 10 minute walk to the Cornelia metro station. The Metro is easy to use in Rome as there are only 2 lines and so it was really easy to get to all the sites. You can get a 3 day pass for all public transport (Metro and buses) for 11 euros - bargain! Getting to the hotel when you arrive in Rome was interesting - we flew into Ciampino airport. You can get a bus for 6 euro return, and they run every half an hour. it takes you to Termini, which is the main station. We then bought the 3 day pass from the station and got on the metro. We then got a bit lost trying to find the hotel as it was dark, so I would recommend you flag down a taxi from the metro station if you arrive at night.

The lady Receptionist on our welcome, was lovely and always very pleasant and helpful - maybe its a case of 'you reap what you sow' - but the older guy who was on the desk in the morning could hardly raise a smile let alone give us some change for the bus! To help you get to the hotel - the numbers 881 or 98 do stop right outside the hotel and you pay a 1 euro coin into the machines on the buses - take coins as no change available. But you need to find all these buses and where they go from! Easiest way form the airport:- 1. get one of the buses into Rome (approx 6 euros) then you can buy the 3 day pass for about \u00a335 from a tobacconists - BUT will you spend this much over 3 days as each bus gives you 75 mins use for each trip, even if you swap buses (includes one metro trip too if you want). The pass includes entrance to colesseum (about \u00a312 each to get in) but we wouldn't have got value for money as we walked so much. 2. at bus station - get on the metro (pay euro for ticket) and go to Cornelia subway. 3. at Cornelia subway, get a bus number 889 (your ticket will still be valid so just get on) and take the bus to Via Torre Rossa road (the bus going towards rome not out of it) 4. Get off on the Via Torre Rossa road just outside the ESHotel on the Right hand side - it's hidden by a wall but is approx 500 yds after turning into the road. Good luck! If you try it by bus, you'll spend most of day searching for the right bus stops for the 881 or 98 from centre of Rome. The hotel is a litle out of Rome but the breakfast is more than adequate - there is a lot of choice and they keep bringing things out so they are trying to improve. the staff in the restaurant were always pleasant and we very much enjoyed our time in Rome.

Brilliant shower in the very modern bathroom ( I love a bath of which there wasnt one but the shower more than made up for that ) The bed was huge and very comfortable and far exceeded what we had expected reading other reviews .We ate here on the first evening and in honesty although the food was enjoyable it was a little on the expensive side and be aware that the main courses come with no side dishes , they are extra. A hotel has to make its money somewhere and we appreciate that so not complaining, but we did decide to eat elsewhere the other nights. Breakfast was pleasant enough. The dining room was clean, nice china, a help yourself to whatever you want affair.

My husband and I booked a superior room and I am so glad we did given that we were there for 7 nights as the standard rooms are much smaller. If you are on the ground floor half of your one window will be below ground, you will be directly in line with the engine of the coach parked outside and it will feel like a cell! Our room in general was fine, fixtures and fittings are not good quality, small stain on the bedspread but bed generally clean and comfortable, housekeeping leaves a little to be desired but generally ok. This hotel is pretty new but rooms are already looking a little shabby in places, grouting in bathrooms is one example and I don\u2019t believe the rooms will stand up to the test of time. No kettle in room, had to ask for one, safe stopped working on day 2 \u2013 not fixed and no one updated us. No English TV channels, sockets not working and there is no individual temperature control in rooms (although there is a misleading thermostat which looks like you should be able to on the wall). There is a fridge in the room with limited drinks availability. I think there was room service, no idea what they served as no information in the room. No information on how to use the phone either. This hotel is good for coach parties as it has a large car park. One evening there were two coaches parked out the front and two at the back. This must be one of the only hotels in Rome where this is possible. The problem is that this makes an early breakfast impossible unless you want to fight your way through crowds. They regularly ran out of cups, bowls and food. Coffee and hot water were from a vending machine, horrible. Food quality was generally poor. Staff were rushed (although heavens knows why because it was all buffet) and generally miserable, no effort at a \u2018good morning\u2019 in any language just \u2018room number\u2019. We waited for the coach parties to leave, and gave them 15 minutes to re-stock. This explains the differences in reviews regarding breakfast. If you go early it is awful, if you go later while the quality of the food does not improve, it is quieter and you may have some crockery. We never bothered trying the restaurant in the evening. Coach parties leaving early mean you may get your own built in wake up call if you are a light sleeper but generally we were ok on the 4th floor, room 416 (they seem to put guests who were staying a bit longer on the upper floors). However if your room faces the front of the hotel the the coaches leave their engines running for some time before boarding. I have seen other reviews which refer to a courtyard and the grounds of the hotel. These no longer exist and it looks like this area has been sold off as there is a temporary fence structure meaning there are only a few tables to sit out at round the back of the hotel which is like sitting in a car park. This hotel is too far out of the city and we had to travel in and out by bus and Sunday evening the buses were busy and infrequent. Rome is a beautiful city and this made our stay, the hotel did not and we used it purely as a base from which to explore. For this it suited our purpose although if we had been closer to the city we may have gone back to our hotel for a couple of hours in the afternoon and then gone out in the evening. The distance of this hotel to the city does not make this possible. We booked this as part of a package but I don\u2019t think this hotel is cheap either so look around. What you may be able to tolerate on a one night stop over will annoy you after two or three. Also check your bill, we were charged for room service we did not receive and an additional internet charge.

When he finally called us to give us our room key, he never got anyone to help us with our bags, he never told us where the lift was to our room, never told us what level floor we were on, never told us the time for breakfast or where it was and never told us our check out time. These requests come as standard. He wasn't rude, but in no way helpful. On check out we were served by a woman who was alot nicer in comparison. The rooms were spotless and had nice contemporary decor. We never ate in the restuarant apart from breakfast, which was lovely and had everything from scrambled eggs, bacon to freshly baked croissants and fresh fruit. The bar and restuarant are brightly lit, with no music, which doesn't really create a nice atmosphere, but these are minor complaints. The location was one of our biggest concerns given the reviews we read. But the bus (which is quite frequent) is literally outside the hotel or it is a 10minute walk to two metro stations. It takes about 10minutes to get into the city centre by public transport (just avoid rush hour, we found out the hard way! :-) Overall i would most likely stay here again. The only improvement would be that some of the staff should take some lessons in customer service and be alittle friendlier :)", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "western australia", "Title": "\u201cNot good at all\u201d", "Author": "arbee8", "ReviewID": "UR117611013", "Content": "Too far out town and I would rate hotel as a 2 not 4 star,lots of things the hotel does not have wouldn't recommend at all,", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel but a bit out of the city\u201d", "Author": "libtek", "ReviewID": "UR113376946", "Content": "This hotel was opened In October 2010 so is very new and up to date. As other reviewers have noted, it is situated outside the City of Rome which does mean that you get a good nights sleep as it's quite quiet, but I didn't realise quite how far out it was (the taxi driver got lost taking us there from the airport). However it was in a nice area and felt quite safe even at night. and buses do go into parts of the City from the bus stop conveniently located outside the hotel. If you get a 3 day or weekly tourist ticket it's very cheap to get around. Checkin was smooth and efficient. The man behind the reception desk was very helpful and provided a map and details on how to get to the Vatican and other sites by public transport.. Our room was quite spacious and very clean. The bathroom was quite big nd well equipped. Although the hotel offered WiFi this wasn't working during our 4 day stay, although as it was a problem with the phone line it wasn't really the hotels fault.. The A/C in the room didn't seem to work which as it was hot was a bit of a problem. When we queried this at the desk on our way out one morning we were told to speak to the afternoon receptionist about switching it on. We didn't get back till about 7.30 that night so didn't bother but opened a window instead. The complimentary breakfast buffet was very good and on the whole we enjoyed our stay. With the exception of the man we saw on our first day I didn't feel that the staff were especially helpful and this and the distance the hotel is from Rome itself stopped it being rated Excellent. However I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel. It's modern, clean and quiet and now I know how to get into the city from the ESH Hotel I would stay there again if I returned to Rome..", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki, Greece", "Title": "\u201cSimply the friendliest\u201d", "Author": "johnzio", "ReviewID": "UR105716660", "Content": "Our group had a really great time at ESH!!!!
