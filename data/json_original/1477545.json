I cannot imagine how small the normal rooms are because our upgrade was tiny and on the third floor. For comparison, I have stayed at the Holiday Inn in the city and had a huge and much cleaner room for a cheaper price. Anyways, on our way to our room we noticed that we were now staying at the River Hotel, instead of the Club Quarters. For the record we had booked a room at the Club Quarters. I guess they put their guests wherever they want depending on room availability. While settling in I managed to find that our towels were shredded, there was mold coming out of our vent and we had blood on our sheets. We called concierge asking for new sheets. They apologized but the man that came to change them said it looks like oil but we will change your sheets anyway. Whatever the hotel decides to think the stain is there is no excuse for dirty sheets in a hotel. At check out we got our bill and immediately noticed that they had charged us for a late checkout. Checkout is at 12 and after waiting in line it was 11:55. The hotels time stamp was set about 40 minutes in advanced and was charging everyone that was checking out a late checkout fee of about $40.

It's maybe a 3 minute walk to the Hyatt where my conference was being held. This was my first stay at a Club Quarters hotel which apparently is a chain of like 14 value-oriented hotels in big cities catering to the business crowd. Anyone can stay at a Club Quarters, but their marketing gimmick is that if you're a member of an affiliated organization, you get a cheaper rate. It turns out, I'm a member of one of their affiliated organizations but was unable to get the cheaper rate either on-line, via phone when I made my reservation, or in person when I showed up. There were different excuses as to why I couldn't make reservations at the affiliated member rate, but I think the 'cheap rate for members' might be more marketing fluff than any real savings. Nevertheless, at ~$130/night + 15% taxes it was a far sight cheaper than the Hyatt. The place is right across from Trump Tower and is close to everything in the loop. Scores or restaurants are within easy walking distance. You couldn't ask for a better location. The building is a high-rise, and the first 10 floors or so are offices or condos I think, with the hotel above that, and they put me on the 38th floor, which I think is the highest floor for regular hotel use. Despite the height, the view wasn't that good since other high rises pretty much surround this building blocking most of the view. I was facing South and could see a small amount of distant South Chicago like McCormick place and the South lakeshore. The room was itty-bitty but adequate. Let me say that in a different way: this is among the smallest hotel rooms I ever stayed in. It was OK for one person but I think a couple would find it oppressively small. Nevertheless it had everything I needed: a firm mattress on the bed, a desk where I could work, fast free wireless internet, and an OK bathroom (shower only). There's no air conditioning in this building, and there's a fan which blew right on me, which I find objectionable so I didn't use it. Opening the window, which is possible, resulted in a hurricane of wind blowing into the room from around the door jamb from the hallway and sounded like a tornado, so I just left the fan off and the windows closed. Fortunately it was cool weather but in July it might be problematic. There was also a high level of street noise when I opened the window, objectionable even from the 38th floor. There was a report of bed bugs from this place, so the first thing I did was tear the bed apart when I walked in the room, and using my high-intensity \"LED mag light\" I saw no evidence of the critters. I would note that some hotels zip the entire mattress into a cotton cloak that can't be opened but they don't do that here. At least for now, and at least in my room, you're safe. The bathroom was small but adequate. There is barely room for your toiletries. The room was oddly shaped, not rectangular, and the desk squeezed into the corner of a triangle if you catch my drift, and the chair kept banging into the wall which you could tell had happened before as the wall was all punched-in at chair height. There's a flat screen TV mounted above the desk, on a swivel so you could watch from the bed if so inclined, or by sitting at the desk but you're pretty close if you do that. I didn't use the cordless phone but they do have 2 phones in the room, a cordless and a regular wired phone. The \"direct dial\" number listed on the phone is actually for some sort of conference center, and people who tired to get me at that number were confused. Better to have people call you at the front desk and have them connect your caller. You need your room key to ride the elevator here, by putting it in the slot and you then have about 15 seconds for the people on the elevator to punch their floors. Seems like good security but any intruder could get on the elevator and punch in a floor like any guest. Sort of gimmicky. The housekeeping was a little spotty. They didn't replenish my toiletries during the entire week I was there, and I had to ask for soap when the last sliver became microscopic, but did provide me with new bar of soap lickity-split. Housekeeping left my door open one day. It just didn't latch properly and theoretically my stuff in the room was at risk of theft. They didn't remove the coffee filter out of the in-room coffee maker one day, which was no big deal for me to do but that's what housekeeping is supposed to be doing. There's a mezzanine on the second floor where they have coffee most of the day, and apples. Nice touch. They also have water dispensers and empty pop bottles on most floors (not mine) but seems like a gimmick too. You can drink Chicago water right out of the tap, which is where I suspect the water comes from anyway, and you don't know if they washed the re-usable pop bottle since the last guy either. They have a business center with a couple of fast computers, and a printer you can use at no expense. I was delighted that the computers were configured so that none of your passwords or usernames get saved once you log out, as best as I could tell. It was nice to be able to print a few items. Kudos to them, based on my experience at other business centers I've used recently. I never got to use the exercise facility so I can't comment. There is an Italian restaurant associated with the hotel but there are literally dozens of places within a 10 minute walk or less you don't have to eat there, and there are also reasonably priced eats (for Chicago) like Corner Bakery and Cafe right next door to the hotel, open until 7:00 so you could even get a fast dinner there if you were rushed. They opened early for breakfast too, at 6:30 AM. All-in-all, a perfectly adequate place to stay. It has everything you need and at a good price for the location.

It is more of the European sized room.", "Date": "September 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - know what you get with Club Quarters\u201d", "Author": "BlackStar926", "ReviewID": "UR39251445", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay at Club Quarters. It was no Sheraton which is down 2 blocks down and gorgeous decor, but they Club Quarters was functional, clean, and they did not nickel and dime you like larger hotel chains. I checked in via a computer (with staff helping me) and it was very easy. There were upgrades avail to go to a suite level for $15 but I stuck to my simple room. It was small. Good enough for one person. The room had a large shower with shower curtain - no tub. They had free internet in the rooms and brought me an ethernet cord for my laptop whose wireless card is not very good. They have a filtered water system in the hallways and empty waterbottles for every guest to help themselves. Usually internet is $10-$15 a day and water is $5 - $7 a bottle. I just really like how this hotel included it all for free! I did not check out the gym, but know it was included as well as a lounge and business area. Great location off of N Wacker. For business travelers I highly reccommend. If you are going to Chicago for vacation, I would get a larger room. For the price you pay, I was very impressed with the Club Quarters and will stay at this location again.", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix AZ", "Title": "\u201cClub Quarters Wacker Dr Chgo---Great Value Great Security\u201d", "Author": "GolightlyPHX", "ReviewID": "UR38775351", "Content": "Recently stayed 7 nights @ Club Quarters on Wacker Dr in Chicago.

Just a side note: they did not mention the 15$ surcharge for the second person until we checked out. The room was pretty standard, nice but a little small. We had a very nice view over the river. What was particularly cool is that they offer filtered water on each floor. Service however was really poor. Towels were not replaced, soap and shower gel had to be ordered on the phone because not even empty bottles were replaced by the staff. There is a complimentary laundry (washing machine and dryer) in the basement. However, there was no detergent. After calling the reception and asking for some, the promised it right away. It took us about an hour to get the detergent in the end. The last thing was the internet. There is wifi in the rooms but it is so incredibly slow and unreliable that we could not really use it at all.

We booked a hotel on a third party website where you do not find out what hotel you booked until after it is booked. We had never been to Club Quarters, and after our terrible experience, we will NEVER be back!!! My husband called the hotel several times at least a week before we arrived to make sure our room could accommodate four people. He was assured that it could. Once we arrived, we were told that four people in our room would violate fire code, so we were being moved to a larger room. We were then made to pay extra for this \"upgrade.\" The Room This was one of the worst rooms I have ever stayed in, and I have stayed in some holes. The room was clean, but that was the only positive thing about it. The room contained one bed that would probably be too small for a 12 year old boy. The mattress was rock hard, and the blanket was thinner than Kate Moss. My husband and I took the bed (more of a sacrifice than a privilege!), and our friend slept on the sleeper sofa. It was extremely dangerous, for it would spontaneously fold up and its springs poked through the barely there mattress. We asked for a rollaway mattress for my friend's sister, but there was not enough room for it. We did use the mattress from it to try to make the sleeper sofa more comfortable, but it did little to no good. My friend's sister ended up sleeping UNDER THE DESK on an air mattress we had (the most comfortable thing in the room!) The room was incredibly small, so we had to literally jump from mattress to mattress to get to the bathroom. Speaking of the bathroom, the door did not lock, the shower curtain was useless, it had no exhaust fan, and there was no bathtub (we were desperate enough to sleep in the bathtub had there been one). The room did have a television, but the picture was always fuzzy, and we had to mess with the cable in order to get any channels. The Staff The staff is what made our stay go from a bad dream to a nightmare. I do not think anyone who works at the hotel is capable intelligence. The staff was EXTREMELY rude and confrontational, blaming US for the hotel's incompetence. We asked repeatedly to speak to a manager, and we were always given the run a round. After one night, we wanted to leave, but we were told we could not get a refund unless we talked to the person who does the reservations for the hotel...IN NEW YORK!!!! We called this person in New York repeatedly who was also rude. In order to get a refund, we would have had to hire a lawyer. The Lies The staff lied to us repeatedly. When we complained about our room, we were told we would be moved to a new room. This never happened. We asked for extra blankets and pillows, and we were told the staff would bring us some. This never happened. We called at least three times before being told the hotel had run out of blankets and pillows. The same thing happened when we asked for more towels (there was only ONE set of towels in the room). Other Issues There were only 2 elevators, so we had to wait a LONG time to get anywhere. Our room key also worked sometimes and did not work at other times. Overall This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Not only was the room terrible, but the staff seemed to take pleasure in our discomfort. They should all be fired. I travel a lot, and I am a very laid back person who rarely complains, but the truth must be told about Club Quarters in Chicago. The word on the trash cans in the hall sums up this hotel...RUBBISH!!!!!", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "Anwen", "ReviewID": "UR34728819", "Content": "Had read some less than favourable reviews so was concerned about the hotel.

There are two PCs with a printer in the Lobby area that you can use for free. The staff were friendly and very helpful. On each floor is a water dispenser with bottles so you don't have to pay for overpriced bottled water from the 7-11. We ate in the hotel restaurant one night and the food and service were excellent. The location is great, right on the river, close to Michigan Ave, within walking distance of so much.
