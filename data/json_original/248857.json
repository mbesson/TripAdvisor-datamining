The hotel is great -- very modern, comfortable large rooms and the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We took two rooms (they have none that are connecting unfortunately), which were good value and included an excellent breakfast in the 5th floor solarium (very nice). The only contstructive criticism I would offer is that the \"concierge\" services were uneven. All of the reception staff offers concierge type services, but we found some that had only basic knowledge while others were much better versed in what Berlin has to offer -- including recommending a great, off-the-beaten track restaurant.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for money\u201d", "Author": "DJKryser", "ReviewID": "UR126912894", "Content": "Great location near most WW2 sites.

There is also a shopping mall 1 min away from the hotel, which has a supermarket at the basement, making it easy to stock up on amenities. The room is large by European standards, is well maintained and comes with free Wifi, a kitchenette (hot plates, utensils and all) and a large bathroom. It was outfitted like a business hotel given the business desk, radio and amenities in the room but this was not unexpected given the commercial buildings surrounding the hotel. Upon checking in, we only found 1 set of everything (pillows, towels etc) but 1 phone call and 5-10 mins later, housekeeping promptly showed up at our door with a second set of everything (including bathrobe, comforter and everything we didn't think we about). We were out most of the day so we did not make use of the services in the hotel, but the front desk staff were very helpful, polite and enthusiastic with helping us. One even ran out into the cold to hail a taxi for us as we were leaving. The one and only thing that annoyed us was the credit card guarantee system. We had already paid up our hotel stay in full the day we checked in. The hotel insisted on a credit card to guarantee our stay chargeable at US50 per day. This was indeed common practice as with all other 5 star and boutique hotels. However, most of the other hotels we stayed in would only proceed to hold the amount (i.e. block the amount so you cannot spend it) and not charge the card. Here, the hotel charged us EU100 on Day 1 and credited EU100 on Day 3. This resulted in our losing out in the forex of EU against our home currency, which was mighty annoying because ultimately the credit card guys are the only ones who benefit from this arrangement. Hopefully the hotel will look into this for future customers of the hotel.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPure Zen\u201d", "Author": "Angel2001", "ReviewID": "UR124611943", "Content": "I won't repeat what many others have said about the exemplary service. breakfast and location, but instead say that this hotel, where I have stayed for 5 nights at the Berlin Film Festival every year for the last 3 years, has the most restful and beautiful rooms and common areas.

Accommodation: The hotel itself is super sleek and stylish and seems to use its space well. There isn't a main lobby so when there is more than 5+ people checking in/out or waiting for an elevator it can get a touch crammed but that's what a boutique hotel is and not a deal breaker in my view. As the hotel is encased in glass, the elevator ride is fairly cool as you can see the Sony Centre and people doing their thing. The first floor has a lounge that sets the tone for a laid back sit-down for drinks and a small bite or a good primer to start your evening. On the top floor is the ONO spa, exercise room, and tanning bed. The exercise room has a good range of equipment, weights and cardio machines to choose from and a lot better than most hotels tend to offer. The spa offers steam rooms and showers, lounge area, and a path of stones on the balcony which vary in size and shape. The exercise room and the steam rooms are free for guests. The spa also offers massage and other esthetic packages which is at an additional cost. I would have appreciated a jacuzzi or small pool but still a relaxing atmosphere. The breakfast on the 5th floor called Facil restaurant offers a good variety breakfast with a handful of freshly squeezed juices, traditional European selection of cold cuts etc and eggs and bacon made to order. Some might think the breakfast is a little steep, and there are nearby restos that can solve that problem. The rooms are spacious with a big balcony, queen-sized bed, tv, lounge chair, desk area, sizeable washroom with bathtub, walk-in closet, coffee-maker, mini fridge and even a little two-range stove top should you decide you needed to heat something up on a whim. I share someone's opinion on the pillows being a little too soft for my liking, but once again, not a big deal. Location x3 Is really what this place is all about as you are within walking distance of the Sony Centre right in front, the Berlin Film Festival Office on the left, and a 3 tier shopping centre called Arcadia offering good eats (including desserts), fashion from Hilfiger to Lauren, Zara to G-Star, Puma to H&M. This is all within 100 metres. Within a short distance walk is some of the main attractions like the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, the Memorial, and even a Salvador Dali museum. The Subway is a cheap, simple and nearby alternative that are can get you everywhere else. The Wrap-up All in all, it was an excellent stay. The hotel is sleek, the staff are incredible and pleasant from the check-in desk to the servers..and with the hotel being situated in such a prime location, there wasn't much need to search too far to not only see some of the memorable sites of Berlin, but take some of it back with you.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cLocation: A+, Service: A+, Room A+\u201d", "Author": "Shuguh", "ReviewID": "UR122882622", "Content": "First trip to Berlin, a city we found very hard to \"figure out\" prior to our arrival, but without a doubt we hit the bull's-eye with Hotel Mandala [pronounced man-dah-LAH in Berlin]. I would recommend this well-run and stylish hotel to both short- and long-term guests. The large rooms with closets galore and affordable rates would make it an ideal choice for a long-term stay. The entire area is all glass-encased new construction [read: no shortage of Starbucks and the like] as this area was literally a no-man's land when the Wall was standing. However it is a short walk to the Berliner Tor [Brandenberg Gate] and Unter den Linden, the main boulevard of Mitte [or \"middle\"] and is also just a few steps to the delightful Tiergarten Park. On the downside your are in the \"middle\" of nowhere, in a way, being between the two sides of Berlin. What this means is cabs, which were not terribly expensive. Whatever you do, do not miss the very moving Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe which is a two or three minute walk from the hotel. A stone's throw from this memorial is the site of Hitler's bunker, thankfully now filled in, above which is currently a non-descript car park. Nothing demonstrated the splintered history of this city more than this strange juxtaposition. The hotel shares the building with other entities, so the ground floor entrance to the hotel is a small doorway directly next to the Berlin Film Festival Offices. There is a small lobby on the ground floor, but the bulk of the hotel is on the upper floors of the building (reached via a glass elevator overlooking the Sony Centre across Potsdamer Stra\u00dfe) including the restaurant, Facil, on the fifth floor and the ONO spa on the eleventh (top) floor. The staff was top notch, embodying that rare combination of being both handsome and helpful. They had the foresight to anticipate our needs and the knowledge to fulfill them. I can't say enough good things about each and every person we encountered at the front desk. Perhaps my opinion of the front desk is tainted by the very generous room upgrade they gave us, from a 50sqm Management Suite to a rather capacious 80 sqm Grand Suite. The glass-enclosed balcony alone was massive with fancy-schmancy electric louvered windows which wouldn't be out of place in a James Bond film. The main part of the room was large and then meandered around to the bedroom/bathroom and the adjoining closet area, meaning an area literally full of open closets. One small complaint, the very stylized tub offered no intuitive way to get the water from the bath to the shower. My friends at the front desk were very helpful, and I sensed I wasn't the first (or last) person to be flummoxed by this vexing plumbing fixture. The breakfast at Facil was simply heaven. The level of service and the wide range of food (all delicious) made this the ne plus ultra of hotel breakfasts. I suggest trying to arrive at non-peak times, as the demand for tables was higher than the supply. The ONO spa is very stylish and offers saunas (no wet heat) and a relaxing area with million dollar views of Berlin. Like most Americans, our knowledge of European history is spotty, at best, so the hotel was able to engage a tour guide named Peter who was a Berlin-native. This was the best money we have ever spent as in three hours we \"got\" Berlin in terms of both its history and its evolution. I highly recommend this intelligent personalized approach for Berlin neophytes over the slightly less expensive tour groups.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "Suzibanter", "ReviewID": "UR122766582", "Content": "The hotel is close to Potsdamer Platz train station and the Sony Centre.

The only negative was housekeeping; there are little buttons on the wall which you push to make a light come on outside your door indicating whether or not you want your room serviced. It seems the housekeeping staff would totally ignore the lights and just come in and clean the room. They would move things all around if the room wasn't dirty, just so their presence would be known. They also TOOK a spoon which I had bought out in the market. I assume the thought it was the hotel's. The spoon was never returned to me.

They are efficient, courteous and helpful and made us feel incredibly welcome. There are no snooty attitudes here - only dedication to good service. Our room, which was a City Studio booked on a deal with Voyage Prive was very nicely appointed. It was modern, clean and unfussy with an excellent walk in wardrobe and kitchenette area. The biggest downside to the City Studios is that they are plagued by the exceptionally noisy main road down beneath. We had to have the windows open because the climate control temperature did not go down low enough in the room - the noise is unbearable. So whilst the city views are quite exciting, please do consider whether noise would be an issue for you. I believe the Garden studios face inwards, away from the road and are probably quieter. Breakfast was included in our stay, and because of this was good value. It was an excellent buffet and we enjoyed it very much. I believe it's quite pricey if not included with your room rate - and probably not worth it. Potsdamer Platz is a great location - some touristy (and so overpriced) eateries in the Sony Centre complex opposite are OK. The Heisser Wolf is great if you want some Currywurst and a lovely beer. Look further afield for better value eats. The rest of the city is easily accessible - we did a lot of walking (The Brandenburg Gate is only a 10-12 minute walk) and the nearby S-Bahn/U-Bahn can take you to most places you need to go. Try out the city bus tours - the hotel will sell you tickets for this at reception. The hotel bar is lovely - we took advantage of the Cocktail deal vouchers we were presented with on check in and enjoyed a couple of well made cocktails on our first night. All in all, a great place to base yourself in whilst in Berlin, but not quite the opulence you may expect from a 5* establishment. It's more like a high-end business hotel.

You\u00b4re also very close to some big theatres and shows + of course the Reichtag and Brandenburger Tor + Unter den Linden. Very close to the U-bahn. Hotel: Seems to be fairly newly renovated. The entrance is very discreet and the reception is tiny and crammed into a corner just inside of the doors. Not very practical by any means. Room: Were booked into a Management Suite (630) at first. Lovely sized room with a balcony, but unfortunately dark and just overlooking the roof of Facil, one of the restaurants. We then voluntarily downgraded to a City Studio (1021) which with it\u00b4s 40sqm is still a perfectly adequately sized room, but with a fab city view to boot. The room itself is nothing extravagant, but very functional. Bed is on the firm side and the pillows rather depressing (read de-flated). But if you ask they will bring you more and better pillows! Please not that the A/C doesn\u00b4t work in wintertime so we spent our first night in a room that resembled a sauna more than a hotelroom. We were of course fiddling with the controls, when we apparently should have adjusted the radiator... The room is still on the warm side, but the windows do open if you need further cool air. There was a smell of bad drain in the room that housekeeping claimed to not being able to do something about. Were offered to change rooms, but could not be bothered once again. Storage is sufficent. Staff: Very correct and pleasant enough. Very helpful once approached Service: Nothing to remark Food: The breakfast room in Facil is recommendable! Lovely, elegant and very relaxed atmosphere. Not a huge selection by any means (unless you\u00b4re into juice), but a very high standard of the items offered. Liked it a lot! Tried Private Dining one night and was presented the quite possibly least flavourful Caesar salad with chicken i have ever eaten. Service was quick and courteous though. Things to do: Don\u00b4t miss a visit to the Reichstag! They also have an excellent restaurant open for dinner. Please do doublecheck if the security is as rigorous as when we were there before going. If yes, then you do need to make a reservation, bring passports and undergo quite a securitycheck before entering. Also the museum island is fantastic!

The next day (on my birthday) when we were getting ready there was a ring on the door and a member of reception staff was standing there with a bottle of chilled bubbly in a bucket and said \"on behalf of the hotel we would like you to have this. happy birthday.\" What a lovely touch. The staff were so helpful with other things, such as direction, recommendations for food and other attractions. On our last night i tipped the helpful receptionist (the one who presented the champers) with a 10\u20ac tip. He said \"there's no need sir. Its my job\". I said \"you have helped us endlessly during our stay. We want to say thank you\". He said \"we need more people like you in this hotel\".

I'm not saying everyone at the hotel is like this, but staff seemed genuinely humbled when ever we even smiled and talked to them. Just our impression from 2 grounded people that just got a cracking deal on this hotel. End of the day these members of staff are working their backsides off to earn a living like everyone else. The only negative is the price of breakfast, but it was the same price as room service so we did that. It was excellently presented and very tasty. The spa was brilliant. Again, one negative was that i had booked a massage and when I went to turn up for it they had actually not typed the booking into the system.

My one criticism was that there was no proper doorman and it is supposed to be a 5 star hotel, so that when we arrived there was no-one to greet us at the entrance or take our luggage. When I asked the girl on reception to send someone out, she said she would, but nothing actually happened. They could not seem to rustle up any English tea bags for the kettle in our room, which I found absolutely incredible, after all it isn't such a strange request. Our friends however needed more hangers and they were found and delivered very quickly. I know this is nit picking, but in a 5 star hotel I think they should at least have a doorman. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel because they wanted 27euros each for a buffet breakfast and no-one seemed to know what the price would be if we just wanted cereal!

This may be the best 4 star hotel but let me tell you why it is lacking that little extra flair: 1. There is no lobby area. The entrance is so constricted that when 4 members of staff are there simultaneously, it feels positively crowded. Contrast this to the Ritz Carlton across the road - now there's a grand lobby area. 2. There is no business centre. The pokey corner they use to set up a laptop which can only be used standing up doesn't count. 3. There is no pool. In summer. Enough said. 4. Staff are efficient (4 star) but not extraordinary (5 star). Contrast this with the Adlon where extraordinary is made to seem normal. 5. On check in staff failed to ask for my choice of newspaper, failed to mention special features such as the bread roll service or ironing/laundry room. I callled to confirm my preferred paper. It failed to arrive 2 out of 3 mornings. 6. The rooms allow for a degree of self-catering and of course room service. Although they are big enough, there is nowhere to eat nor is the room service provided on trolleys which double up as tables, like any good 5 star establishment would do. 7. The hotel is 11 years old and the hallway carpets look and smell every bit as old. Memo to management - rip up that ugly carpet immediately. 8. The Grundig TV, a true boxy (30 cm) looks like it belongs in a museum. If you enjoy unwinding in fron tof a TV, you'll be sorely disappointed. A flat screen TV would do this place a world of good. 9. In the room, only 1 set of small white wine glasses are provided - for water, beer, wine - whatever you plan to drink. Contrast this to the Adlon where no fewer than 4 different types of top qulaity galsses are provided. 10. Need an extra bed? Don't bother - the main bed is great but the extra bd has a mattress so thin and uncomfortable as to be utterly useless. On the positive side: 1. Excellent location with easy access to train stations and many attractions. 2. Very spacious rooms. 3. The aforementioned laudry room with steam iron. 4.

The metro station Potsdamer Platz is only 1 minute walk from the hotel entrance. In the front of the hotel, on the other side of the street, is the Sony Center, with IMAX cinema etc, and behind the hotel, there is this big shopping mall, and a small street (without cars) with a lot of nice restaurants, bars, lounges etc. But, as I said, it takes only 5-7 minutes to walk to Brandenburger Tor, Tiergarten (a big beautiful park, like central Park in New York) and the majestic Bundestag-building. From Brandenburger Tor, you can go down the main street - Unter den Linden - with a lot of boutiqes, restaurants and life. And when you have reached the end of Unter den Linden, you are near Alexanderplatz and Berliner Dom and a lot of other exciting places to see. So, the Mandala Hotel is very centrally located. But the best part, is that - in a busy city like Berlin - you can walk into the mandala hotel and just fell the relaxing and calming atmosphere the moment you wealk in the doors. We were met by very service minded staff, which offered us some warm refreshment towels when we checked in. We arrived a couple of hours before check-in time, but we got our room, and a very nice gentleman from the staff helped us up tp our room. The room is really an apartment - a suite!! We had a normal standard room, yet it was huge! And beautifully furnished with delicat interiors. And with a balcony. A very nice bed, with excellent madrasses, a big bathroom with a tub and lot of space. it also had a sofa and chairs, and tv and stereo - with a seleciton of cd's. The room also had a fully equiped kitchen, and a walk-in closet. I would say this is GREAT value for money. At the top floor of the hotel there is a spa. Here you can go relax after a long day out sightseeing. They have this \"foot-therapy\"-thing on the roof, that is a great, romatic experience to do with your partner, I would recommend to do it after it is dark. This is a \"pathway\" a small way that goes around the building on the roof, with marvellous view over Berlin skyline. Here, you should walk on stones lays down in different shapes and patterns to relaxe and heal tired feet, and it helps! Definately a nice thing to do. The breakfast is also GREAT. Very delicate, good selection of different fruit, vegetables, meat, cheese, jam, etc - all you can axpect in a luxury hotel. They also had something like 10 different fresh juices - I would reccomend the fresh apple-juice:) Eggs and omelets can be ordered directly from your table. We would highly recommend this hotel, for its relaxing and freindly atmosphere, for the great value for money and for the good location in Berlin. PS - one evening we bought tickets for a consert with the Belin Chamber Orchestra in the Berliner Dom - wonderfull! If you get a chance to do this - go for it!! Great sound with brilliant achustic and a wonderfull church.

Individual orders for your choice of egg dishes were taken and delivered in perfect time. The ambience of the breakfast room was very pleasant too, and you were never hurried. Weekend breakfast times are extended to 12noon - which is great for those who enjoy a lazy morning. I used the gym on the top floor a couple of times (free to residents) and it was well equipped and spotless. My only minor quibbles would be, that in a 5-star hotel today, I do not expect to have to pay for internet access \u2013 it's rather like having to pay for hot water or TV! It's made all the worse when you walk past 2-star motels and back-packer hostels, all offering free internet access.

Really wonderful location - I agree with the other location comments, and add only (as others have) that not only are you near everything, but the Potsdammer Platz area itself has a lot more than first meets the eye.

We did not get breakfast included but went next door to a perfectly fine coffee shop place, and there are other places too. The hotel has a fairly extensive buffet, but unless you're a big eater you won't begin to get your money's worth - I think it was $25 a person. The multiple guest laundry rooms were clean, free, well-equipped (even with free detergent) and even had a TV - for this reason alone I would stay there again.

I had called the front desk because the navigational system told me I had arrived but I couldn't see the entrance, so the front desk person came running down the sidewalk to find and guide me, unloaded (despite my obscene volumes of luggage), then valet-parked my rental car. I was really tired, but the staff were extremely friendly, helpful, upbeat, succeeded in getting me to laugh and smile and cheer up after a nasty 700 Km drive... The best was yet to come: the room. To be honest, I'd never seen a room quite like this one, bedroom, living room / study, kitchen / dining room, two bathrooms, entrance hallway, wrap-around balcony including nice views of their rooftop bamboo garden, the whole thing in extremely tasteful blond wood tones.... I feel like I'm writing for an architectural magazine, but it's true. I paid about EUR 250 for the room (may be expensive if you're on a personal vacation), but right in the center of sold-out (owing to a convention) Berlin and desperate for a hotel room on a business trip, it really was a bargain, 1/3 the price being charged by similar class hotels at the time. Business services I need all worked flawlessly: unloading and valet-parking the car, efficient checkin/checkout, wakeup call, room service breakfast, internet access, send/receive faxes, printing e-mails and document attachments and then sending them up to my room, it was great. Personally, I'd seriously consider staying here on a family vacation as well, though, because the room had so much space, at least 4 separate rooms, a full kitchen with stove, large eating-alcove with table for 4, refrigerator. The only possible drawback was that the bar was tiny, no pool, cramped common areas, but personally I ate room service breakfast to save time and spent all my time in the room, either sleeping or working against a deadline. Location also is not ideal I think as it's in an extremely modern, sterile, new-construction development on the Alexanderplatz, but I guess you can't have it all and it's an EUR 5 cab ride from the Unter den Linden.

With well-appointed rooms, beautiful interiors, a newly renovated spa and a smiling staff you'd think this hotel had it all. Unfortunatley that wasn't the case during our stay. To begin with they couldn't find our reservation. Three people at the front desk spent 15 minutes not finding it. I was then directed to their customer computer to find the reservation myself. Too bad their computer was out of order. I suggested that they call the site we used to book the room This came as an unexpected idea. At first they were reluctant...the lines might be busy (?!) but eventually the manager decided to give it a go. We were then sent to the bar for a complimentary coffee while they sorted things out. At this point approx. 45 minutes had passed since our arrival. 15 minutes later someone arrived to tell us that they had located out reservation: it had been \"lost in the system\" but the manager with his \"special computer\" had been able to retrieve it. Sigh. She tells us that the room is made up for one but that they'll immediately send someone up to prep it for two. Four hours later no one has arrived. We call reception and they send someone up. However, for the rest of our stay there is still only one bathrobe and one set of slippers. In the beautiful newly renovated spa I'm hoping to get a massage so I go up to look at the different treatments available. A week after their new opening they have no brochures or any other printed material about which treatments they offer. They seem puzzled by me (all 7 of them staring at me when I ask for some information) and the spa manager promises to send something to my room. 3 hours later (and too late for me to book a treatment) a thick manilla folder arrives full of information. Lastly, the bar. Which I love! Wonderful drinks and a nice ambience! We order the After Work special which they've advertised and receive champagne cocktails. After another drink and dinner (excellent kitchent) we receive our bill. The price for the After Work special is 11 euros whereas it was advertised at 5 euros. When I ask the waitress she looks confused and goes to speak with the bartender. She returns and informs us that there is no After Work special, only a Special drink of the day (full price).

Additionally, my room featured a balcony which looked out the back of the hotel onto a brick building and a very quiet street. Small touches made it especially comfortable for me - the swivel tv (so it wasn't a flatscreen, but still), the CDs, the books in the shelves. Everything was clean and crisp, and the AC was making sure that I wasn't dying of heat (37\u00b0 C). I was a little miffed at the price for the WLAN, considering you can get it free right across the street in the sony center (an amazing new complex!!!), or at a number of coffee or food chains, but I guess you can't have it all. The staff at the front desk were well schooled and very helpful. Unfortunately, the spa on the 11th floor is being renovated so I did not get a chance to experience anything of that sort. The spa in the sister hotel is available for use, however. I also enjoyed a couple of drinks and dishes in the first floor lounge, and thought both the lounge and the food were excellent (and again, most attentive staff). The area itself is one of my favorites in berlin - everything is new and modern, and shopping/dining is plentiful around here.

We booked into an executive suite which was easily the biggest hotel suite I've stayed in. The room was split into 3 with a large desk/sitting room area with a swivelling television, then the bedroom area with a massive bed and lovely firm foam mattress and then a massive bathroom which is easily as big as some hotel rooms I've stayed in! Not only did it have a huge bath, but it had 2 massive sinks, a separate toilet area and a massive walk in shower in a wet room area. It was extremely good value for money at 180 Euros a night! When we arrived it was 30 degrees and we were given cold towels at reception! The staff were excellent and tended to our every needs. The area around the hotel is safe with the Sony Center just over the road if you want to pop across for a drink or light dinner. It's also around 1 minutes walk to the Potsdamer S & U Bahn which means you're only minutes away from any place in Berlin! It's also quick and easy to walk north from the hotel to the Jewish Memorial, Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag...all within 5-10 minutes easy walk. We had breakfast included in our room and I would recommend doing this as it's 24 Euros per person if you dont! The breakfast is however, excellent, with around a choice of 8 different homemade juices (carrot and orange, yum!), excellent breads and meats and a wide choice of cereal and fruit. Breakfast on the weekends is served until 12, which was a massive bonus for lazy people like myself! Overall, the location and quality of this hotel are second to none.

The wines were also wonderful--if you don't want a bottle, the sommelier recommendations by the glass are outstanding. Qiu also serves lovely food, but is not necessarily going to be your destination dinner place--you won't be disappointed if you go there, though, if you are tired after a busy day. We stayed in a Management Suite, which featured tons of closet space (more than enough for 2 people) and a super-large bathroom. The largest hotel room we have stayed in while in Europe. There was even a small terrace (no seating here--though we didn't ask for chairs, so I don't know if they are available).

You could order hot food from the staff, who all seemed to speak six languages. On our first night, we'd had an early start and just wanted to relax with a DVD in our room and some pizza. The staff helped us to find a DVD in English from their library (bring your own...most are German) and ordered pizza from a local restaurant for us. They were very helpful.

Since each package included a dinner at their restaurant (Facil) I had emailed the hotel to make certain that the reservations had been made and for which nights, as I had requested in March when I booked the stay. Two days before we left, I received an email stating that the restaurant was closed. After a game of email tag, they wrote that they agreed to book us in another restaurant. Fine. When we arrived, the staff was very nice and helpful, held our luggage for us, gave us some tips, brought us towels to freshen up, etc. Couldn't have been nicer. Then it all fell apart. They also did not mention that the hotel was being renovated. Drilling and hammering started at 8:30 a.m. and paint fumes filled the halls to the point of giving us a headache. Also, try getting a newspaper delivered to your room. They finally got it right by the time we left. The final straw was trying to book the second dinner. The first one they arranged was great - Vox which I highly recommend. I kept asking whether we could book the second dinner for the night before we left. After much hand wringing from the staff let me know that the manager would need to approve it. I kept repeating taht the package included two dinners. They kept telling me that the manager would call. That never happened. Finally one morning there was a note on the desk which I found after coming out of the shower. It indicated that they would allow us a second dinner at Le Forbourg restaurant at 8pm. Now the manager's tone of \u201callowing us\u201d was annoying since we paid for his as part of the package. Long story to short, the restaurant had no reservation or idea of any arrangement. It was very embarrassing. Sitting down to what was one of the worst meals in Berlin (we never had the chance to order wine, needed a flare to get a waiter, basically inedible food, you get the idea), we were out of there in a half an hour. The front desk at the hotel apologized said they\u2019d take care of it. After waiting for three hours for a response from the manager, I finally camped out in the lobby to wait for him (Herr Schaeffer). He first said that he tried to speak with me and there was no answer at our room, which was a lie since we sat there for three hours. Then he basically told me that there's nothing he could do, they'd pay for that meal at that restaurant, not arrange another and blamed the entire episode on Luxury Link. Then proceeded to tell me that the restaurant did indeed have a reservation for us and that there was a miscommunication. THEN he proceeded to tell me that they had placed phone calls me to letting me know that the restaurant was closed and that they were renovating.This was not the case and his accusitory tone was at best rude, at worst innappropriate. His lack of customer care was a nightmare. I Seems like he had someone to blame for everything - including us!

He said, \" Yes, some people also want to live on the 10th floor, what shall we do then?\" Actually, I see myself no surprise that some people want to live on the 10th floor, because it's demand-supply world, and they have every right (if they pay) to live on the 10th floor if they have requested it and noone said it's not possible beforehand.

We ate in the restaurant twice, once for breakfast, which was amazing and once at the Michelin star restaurant Facil which was out of this world. I've eaten in a lot of restaurants and never experienced service or food like it. I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough, we were very sad to leave and will definitely be returning to our \"Oasis of Calm\"!", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork", "Title": "\u201cA disaster waiting to happen...\u201d", "Author": "L&MCork", "ReviewID": "UR6898259", "Content": "After check-in we were shown to our room which turned out to be a garden studio when we had booked (& paid for in advance) a management suite. Nobody told us at any point that we were not being allocated our correct room & it was only when we were shown to our room & queried the type of room given that we were told that the hotel was being refurbished & that this was the only room available. After much discussion and disappointment we were finally assured that we would be upgraded the following night & given a complimentary bottle of champagne. There were no other rooms available on our day of arrival. Totally dissatisfied with the deception & lack of customer focus on arrival we felt we had no option but to accept this offer. First morning in our new suite we were woken at 7.00 a.m. to the sound of drills and constant hammering. Following our call to reception we were told that the hotel was undergoing 'emergency essential maintenance' & there was nothing they could do. Basically, we had to put up with the noise and disturbance. However, the same occurred on day 2 and day 3 - at precisely the same time! In the meantime, on day 2 we discovered a bag of dirty working clothes behind the curtains in our room - obviously overlooked by housekeeping & not a very good indication of their levels of cleanliness! The bathroom only had one bathrobe, one pair of slippers, insufficient shampoo & shower gel & was generally shabby. Overall, we were extrememly disappointed with our stay in The Mandala. We paid for and expected 5-star service & accommodation but actually experienced far less. The staff were cold & uncaring and really did little to ease the problems we encountered. Stay there at your peril!! For us - never again.......", "Date": "March 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cAmazing, beautiful, handsome hotel\u201d", "Author": "glee31", "ReviewID": "UR6481104", "Content": "Mr. O took me to Berlin for a surprise weekend. We booked into The Mandala Hotel on the Potsdamer Strasse. There is also another Mandala Hotel but I reckon the location of the one we choose was best suited to the purpose of our break which was to sample the atmosphere of the German Xmas markets and do some shopping. As soon as our taxi pulled up in front of the Hotel the Concierge greeted us and took our bag for us to Reception. Then once we had checked in, he again took receipt of our bag and escorted us to our room; one of the Management Suites on the sixth floor. This included a kitchen, a walk in wardrobe, a living room with Study area, a patio terrace with views overlooking the Christmas Market below and two further built in wardrobes. I could move in there tomorrow!! The concept of the hotel is to create a home away from home and it certainly achieves that goal and then some. The bed was very comfortable and the great thing is in the morning there is not a sound to be heard from House Keeping going about their chores; no knocking your door or vacuuming the room next door, etc. Also a television placed mid centre of the room swivelled to allow one to watch television either from the couch or from the bed; not that we had much chance to watch television as there was so much else to do. Accompanying this was a powerful Grundig stereo system with a handful of music CD's to get one in the right mood. The restaurant on the fifth floor was full on the first morning so we had breakfast in the bar on the first floor which offered a wide selection of different beverages; fruit juices, lattes, cappuccinos, green tea etc. There was a wide selection of breads, cheeses, cold meats, different types of spreads and also one could order hot food from the kitchen; eggs, waffles (not to mention the small little fruit tarts and mini chocolate cakes!!). We managed to have a table in the restaurant the following day and the surrounding was absolutely fabulous; the sun came in through the glass roof top and also there were some very ornate interesting water displays. They had thought of everything including small stools for ladies to put their handbags on; which all restaurants should have as who wants to put their Bottega Veneta on the floor!! As guests of the hotel, we had access to the Wellness Spa and Fitness Lounge; located on the top floor of the hotel. In the Sauna Room there was a big window offering great panoramic views across Berlin. Also the walls were adorned with very sexy prints of men throughout which would make one sweat even if the work-out didn't; it couldn't have been more exciting!! Also there were Laundry Rooms on all the floors which housed a washing machine and dryer and an iron and ironing board, so one could do one's last minute ironing if needs be before one headed out into Berlin. There was even a television in the Laundry Room which one could watch while the Laundry was being done. The hotel's location is great; it's very close to a lot of the main cultural & political places of interest; the Holocaust Memorial, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, Checkpoint Charlie, the Tiergarten, the Sony Centre, etc. And not forgetting of course the Potsdamer Strasse itself. Also everything was within easy reach either by foot or by metro; the U-Bahn. Furthermore the market just outside the hotel was one of the best Markets we saw on our trip and to have it literally at one's doorstep was such a treat. There were ski slides and various other forms of entertainment at the market and Mr. O and I had great fun going down the ski slope on big inflatable rubber tyres. This is one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in and we will definitely book into the Mandala Hotel again if we are back in Berlin which seems a certainty after this wonderful trip.

How could such a nice-sounding room cost so little? I decided to give it a try. My 80 sq-meter room was spectacular (literally): kitchenette, living room, nice bedroom, and of course a terrace. The hotel restaurant is set in a garden and has a calming feeling. (Unfortunately, it didn't have enough room for breaifast, so the overflow had to eat in the hotel lounge--still nice, though.) Location's not in the throbbing heart of town, but there's still enough going on, and it is close to the U-bahn.

First off, the hotel is very stylish and hip with a gorgeous lobby and lounge. The staff was friendly and attentive but no overly so. We were delighted that upon check in that we were upgraded to a HUGE suite. I have never seen a hotel room that was so large. It had a kitchenette, living room with dining area, bedroom with office and a huge marble bath. It also had a giant walk-in closet to store our things, which was just great. And when we thought there couldn't be more, we open the curtains to reveal a 30 ft balcony! With the relatively low rate we were paying we thought there must be some mistake and that someone was going to show up and tell us we were in the wrong room! We also appreciated that the room was immaculately clean, the pillows and bed were heavenly, and the decor of the room was very modern and fashionable. Also fashion and architecture magazines were provided for us which was a nice touch. The location was okay. Potsdamer Platz is a newly developed area with lots of great architecture however as another person mentioned, it is not near any of the cool nightlife or shopping. However taxis were always available outside the hotel and a giant U-Bahn station was right there. Also there is a big mall in the Potsdamer Plaz complex which was handy when we needed to find a drugstore, grocery store or quick bite to eat.. Overall this hotel was an amazing value for the money and would not stay anywhere else in Berlin.", "Date": "October 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "Anon_Traveller_UK", "ReviewID": "UR5968182", "Content": "The hotel is in a up and coming area of Berlin, where people are on the go 24/7 - its great for nightlife.
