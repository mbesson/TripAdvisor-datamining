I am quite budget concious, so given the lcoation I feel this is one of the best values in Rome. It is directly across from the forum and down the street from the colleseum. We literally walked all over rome from here: Trastavere, the Vatican, Spanish steps, Trevi fountain, and don't miss the small church which is only couple blocks away that is very unassuming... it houses the chains that held St.Peter and Michaelangelo's famous Moses sculputre. If you're not a walker, buy one of the tourist bus passes and hop on and off. Back to the hotel... It was clean, the room size was bigger than I expected, and the bed was mediocre. The breakfast is similar to other places: very standard european fair: crossaint and coffee. Through my research I found out you can see the forum from some rooms if you look out the window and to the left. I requested one of these rooms, but later regretted it. These rooms face a busy street, so there was much noise all night. At 3:00am there was an argument between 4 garbage men - it sounded like they were in my room. I popped my head out the window and yelled at them, but after simulateously pausing and looking in my direction they went back to their conversation (they obviously had no idea what \"shut the f*#! up\" means). The next day the hotel was very accomodating about moving me to a room on the backside. This room had a small balcony, but it was on an interior courtyard for a few other building and a restaurant (i.e. grungy view, but I didn't care). The next night we had piece and quiet! Overall the service was good and the room was clean. I would definitely recommend this to someone traveling to the area who wants to be centrally located. As a side note that has nothing to do with this hotel. My wife and I actually had a hard time finding good food in Rome - it is all tourist crap i.e. pizza & crappy pasta. For authentic Italian food at good prices go to the Trestavere neighborhood (sp?). It's not far and it's what they consider the working class neighborhood. Also, if you like indian food, go east on the main street in front of the hotel and there will be an indian restaurant about a block and half up on the left - it is the best Indian food I've had in my entire life!", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bergen, Norway", "Title": "\u201cSmall, friendly and nice.\u201d", "Author": "gkfld", "ReviewID": "UR115859138", "Content": "This small, but very clean and suprisingly quiet place, was a pleasure to stay at.

We were'nt offered Tea / Coffee on arrival as we had to wait until the room was cleaned (at 2.30pm) & there was'nt even facilities (for tea / coffee) in the room. There is no wireless internet, lounge, bar or resturant here and when we asked for a good place to dine we were pointed in the direction of the place next door. (tourist trap) There appears to have been street works going on right outside recently so the ground was a bit rough. The area is very touristy and can be noisy, but this hotel is within walking distance from every attraction within Rome (especially the Collosseum and Forum), Though we did take the bus to the Vatican. We did walk back that evening (and back to the Vatican the next day approx 40 min walk) every other attraction is no more than 30 min walk at the most. The room was clean though housekeeping did not change out towels throughout our three night stay.

I nudged my hubby several times to go ask what the room tariff was for the glass door facing us...and while he was reluctant at the idea of moving I was too curious, not expecting it would actually be less than the Holiday Inn we were staying at REALLY FAR away.. Romano @ 70EUR and 60EUR (rooms 424 and 425) were cheaper than Holiday Inn and although the rooms were small, they were clean and cozy and less American. I stay at hotels all the time because I travel for work and really I was craving a Roman feel(although I love the Intercontinental Group for their decor and hospitality) People & Service: Santo, the man who greeted us in did not lose the niceties in translation. He was sweet, so was the second person in the afternoons (he was also very helpful, thanks to him we saw more than my Hubs would have agreed to walk otherwise) BUT....the last guy at the counter at night when we checked out 2 nights later was horrible...he should either learn some manners or look for another job. I would hate Romano to lose business because of a sulky soul like his. All in all it was value for money... as for me, waking up to face the chariots and to eat amazing cake for breakfast is a treat for me.

When we spoke to the staff at reception about this, they would apologise & say it would be sorted but didn't seem to bothered about it.

The sheets were also crisp and clean. However, the room itself was NOT clean. There were stripes of grime on the walls and around the switches. The wall paper was torn in several places, giving the room a shabby look. Also, on the negative side, the walls were paper thin, so that when the people in the next room talked and laughed it sounded as if they were in the stairs talking to eachother from one floor to the next.

The hotel is also right in between two metro stops (Cavour and Colosseo on the Blue Line -- you can get off at either). There is one big disadvantage: the hotel is at the corner of two major streets and the traffic noise goes on all night. While we were there there was also jackhammering on the street in front of the hotel starting at 8 in the morning. Also, the lobby is tiny and there is no breakfast room. We had breakfast in a roped off area on the sidewalk in front of the hotel and I'm not sure what they do in bad weather.

They also folded up your clothes and straightened the room out very nicely. - The newly installed elevator is excellent, especially because we were on the top floor, i wouldn't of fancied climbing the 5 floors with our suitcases! :) - The shower was good and powerful, just the ticket for freshing up after a day's sightseeing, providing piping hot water all day. - The beds were comfortable and the pillows lovely and soft. - The view from our window was beautiful, we looked out on to the roman forum, it was amazing. - The breakfast consisted of cappucino, fruit juice, crossaint, various pastries and toasted bread. The capuccino is gorgeous but the italian bread is quite hard. I cannot but stress the excellent location of this little hotel, situated a few hundred yards from the coloseum and the monumento di emanualle.
