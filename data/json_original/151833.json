Before arriving I had read in some of the other reviews that the employees were rude, the rooms were tiny, the place was always under construction and about all the other \"problems\" that could potentially ruin our vacation but because I was trying to budget on my room so that I could finacially esperience all of Puerto Rico I opted to take a chance and roll the dice. At nearly $100.00/night you can't beat the price. Many larger hotels are within a stones throw from here but you will pay more. But it is a no frills hotel, don't expect the red carpet rolled out on arrival. Okay LOCATION ....the best!!! Beach front, walking distance to EVERYTHING, food, shopping, nightlife..you name it. It's all right there. The staff was efficient at checking us in -took maybe five minutes. They were a little stoic in apperance but I later saw that most everyone from P.R. appears this way. The rooms were small but VERY clean and well kept.. newly renovated. House keeping came by every morning to clean and provide fresh linens. The bad part is you can hear anyone walking/talking out in the halls but we were only in our rooms at night to sleep. The only construction going on was at the bar area from about 10 am until the sun went down but we could not hear it from our room. Maybe thats because we did not have an ocean facing room (why pay for this when we were seriously only in it to shower change and sleep??) The bar on the beach is small but quaint. Off to one side is where the construction was taking place but they had it all blocked from view and the music they played was loud enough to make the construction seem non existent. The beers/drinks were cheap- happy hour all day!!!! There is a large gay presence but if your not a total homophobe then there are no problems. I didn't see ANY innapropriate behavior but still the atmosphere here is adult oriented ..don't bring the kids. Besides.. this is everyones vacation... not just yours :) Manny, Ivan and Carlos at the bar were very attentive..bring cash or you'll have to open a tab and pay a surcharge. I used my credit card though (with the money I saved on staying here I didn't have to budget so much on the extras) The Atlantic is RIGHT THERE..like steps away. It was AMAZING and so Relaxing!!! All the patrons were very friendly and we ended up hanging out with alot of people we met on the beach soakin up the beautiful sun during the day and bar hopping with them at night. My boyfriend and I had an amazing time!!!! If you are looking for hot tubs and all the luxury of the HYATT then don't stay here, but if your open minded, wanting to save some cash while staying at the BEST location.. then this is a great place to stay. We can not wait for the cold weather to return to our state so we have an excuse to get back to P.R. and we WILL definately to stay here again.. I've stayed at much nicer hotels in my life and i have had my issues with staff being rude, plumbing, noise levels, ect. but none of that seemed to really be an issue here. This was just our perception though... We rolled the dice ...and won. :)", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cAaaahhh Right on the Ocean\u201d", "Author": "Born_to_go61", "ReviewID": "UR127242565", "Content": "You are steps from the Atlantic and what a nice beach.

Their lobby was newly renovated to compete against the modern beach bar/club that had opened next door. The hotel gave the illusion of being a clean place to stay; that was soon to be proven false! Let me start by saying I have never stayed in such a dirty hotel but for the sake of saving thirty bucks (compared to the big chain beach hotels next door), I went against my better judgment and decided to stay once I saw the incredibly tiny room. The images that are shown of the rooms are not what you actually get when you stay here. The halls had filth everywhere and a significant amount of mold was present around the bathroom! I was willing to overlook this and stay since I had paid in advance for the room on-line and believed it to be nonrefundable. The location is great, right on the beach, but so are a number of large very clean chain hotels for slightly more per night. Spend the extra few dollars and stay at one of those! I later changed to a room with a view that was big enough for two adults to move in and paid extra for it, but mold was still an big issue in the new room, again I tried to not let that bother me too much. The Atlantic Beach Hotel is doing construction on the roof and on another floor (it only has 4 stories of hotel rooms), and on the second night their workers started jackhammering at 7:15 AM! This happened on my third night as well, so I finally decided to politely say something to the only employee working there at that time. They looked surprised. Why? They could clearly hear the banging from the lobby for themselves. I was given a quick and insincere apology. The next morning the workers starting hammering an hour earlier, at 6:15 AM!!! I then complained to an employee who was there most of the time (who locals later told me was the owner) and they just stared at me blankly. I told them this was unacceptable and that guests should have been warned so they could negotiate a refund and make other arrangements, at least do not charge me for the useless upgrade. I was told I got a 50% off promotional rate (NOT TRUE); locals told me that what I was paying was NOT half off and that I was being lied to again. The entire staff became incredibly rude and aggressive towards me because I dared to stand my ground and complain. Never have I experienced such an unprofessional attitude, especially from a service oriented business. When I asked for the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name (I pretended to not know who it was), I was told that a corporation owned the hotel, and the only number available was to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front desk. All lies, just like many of the locals nearby had come to tell me. I never even got an apology from the owner or the rude staff\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. just lies. I have a dispute pending with my Credit card company against them. You will not get your money back nor will you get hospitality at this hotel!

I had read the reviews and it was typical of the reviews that I read for budget properties. I have stayed in many budget properties and generally give little regard to comments pertaining to being treated rudely by staff, dirty rooms etc. Of all of the budget hotels I have stayed in only one of them has truly earned that reputation, and the Atlantic Beach hotel is not one of them. As long as the reviews don't mention bed bugs I will give the place a try, There was no mention of bed bugs, so I went ahead and booked this reservation. I paid $79.00 for an ocean view room located directly on the beach in a hotel/tourist area of San Juan (The Condado area). One thing that should be mentioned is that this hotel is gay friendly. From my observation, the hotel does have a large gay clientele. If this is a problem and you are not going to be comfortable in this environment then don't book here. We were a group of 2 straight couples and my thoughts were that if the place is safe for gays it will be safe for straights. My first impression of the hotel upon entering was that it reminded me of many of the Miami South Beach boutique hotels. It was light and airy with the back entrance completely open and leading into the patio bar area overlooking the beach. Contemporary couches and coffee tables furnish the lobby. The check in was as per the reservation and I found the staff who checked me in to be friendly and helpful. I was given an oceanview room with one queen bed. The only thing that I would agree with regarding some of the reviews I read is that the elevator is absolutely ancient and there is a scare factor involved in using it. We were on the 4th floor so I would take it up, but took the stairs for the trips down. It also had a strong musty odor that necessitated breathing through the mouth for the trips that I did use for when going up. The room itself was fine. The queen bed was very comfortable and the bedding was white duvet. Loved it. The windows opened letting the ocean breeze into ,the room. There is a flat screen plasma tv that is wall mounted and the rest of the room furnishings were sparse. There was a desk and 2 chairs and a side table. The art and lamps were fairly new and the smoke detector did appear to be in working order. The bathroom for sure is small, but the shower is big enough for 2. I was relieved to find a good blow dryer in the bathroom as well. The room that we occupied was noisy in that it was located next to the air conditioning unit. Rule of thumb when travelling. Bring earplugs. The noise from the a/c did not bother me but my husband was aware of it.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Not That Great a Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Love_2_Travel_djkljd", "ReviewID": "UR121784713", "Content": "As the title says the hotel is in a great location, right on the beach, but it has many problems. Construction has been going on for years, you couldn't even get in the main entrance when I was there (see attached picture). You had to squeeze between parked cars with your big luggage, walk sideways in the gutter, and enter thru the back beach entrance where the bar is. I checked in and headed towards the infamous elevator. It is indeed quite scary. Tiny, dark, rickety, and the door had problems. The door doesn't even open all the way. It opened about 16 inches. My suitcase was wider than the elevator door opening. I had to turn it sideways to get it thru the elevator door. I got to my room, which was a remodeled ocean view room. The temp and lighting was OK in there, but there was one small problem - ANTS!!!! A whole conga line of ants was running along the window sill non-stop. Right above the bed. I didn't want to wake up covered in ants, so I went downstairs to complain. The guy said \"Someone must have been eating in there\". Eating on the 4 inch window sill? Needless to say I switched rooms. My new room was also an ocean view room. It had no ants but it was also darker and hotter. It was missing a light the other room had. Also there is no way to control the temperature in your room. You are at the mercy of whatever the hotel thinks the hotel temp should be. The manager told me to check the vents and see if someone closed them. How do I check them? They are 10 feet up. I stood on a chair. There is no way to adjust the vents. I had to get some long tweezers and stick them in there hoping I wouldn't drop them into the abyss. I was able to adjust them some but it still stayed too hot in there. I had trouble getting to sleep from the loud music being played in the hotel next door (which looked nicer than this one). No room in the bathroom for your stuff. I had to set some on top the toilet.

The hotel is still going through renovations, particularly in the lobby area; however, this does not get in the way of hotel guests. We were on the 4th floor and had an ocean view. We were actually in the double room as there was a front door for rooms 410 and 411. Each room was on opposite sides of each other and had it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own door with a bathroom in the middle. The bathroom did not have a real door just a thin, flimsy sliding door, so it's not that useful if you are traveling with friends or other family members and would want real privacy as you shower or use the bathroom. Plus, you needed the key for the front door to enter the room 410/411 area and also for each individual room. If you mistakenly closed your room door while going to the bathroom, you would lock yourself out of your room if you did not bring the key to the bathroom with you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strange set up. I was charged higher than what is listed on the web site since I had one of the largest rooms. Our view was of the ocean and since we were on the 4th floor, we were not bothered by the very loud music being played nightly at the bar. However, be prepared for the music to last past midnight and be sure to request an upper floor if at all possible. Nor, could we hear the construction during the morning hours. Based on the reviews I read before traveling to this hotel, I knew to ask for the \"upgraded\" room. While our room was upgraded, it was also built as the handicap room; however, it was fully functional for us. The room was very clean and seemed newly renovated. The floors were beautifully tiled, as was the entire bathroom and shower. The walls were freshly painted and very clean, pure white. However, since this is a boutique hotel, they did take some shortcuts. There was no flat screen tv, only an older tube box. Also, besides the new headboard and sideboard for the bed, the dresser and night stand looked to be from before they renovated the hotel. Both were very old and dated looking. The room was very plain. One small dresser, one very small closet and two night stands with two very well used, not so clean lamps on them. Now, here are my real complaints. Because this is a small, boutique style hotel, I believe they are taking way too many shortcuts for the price one pays. They need to tweak a few details, for example: -Our room had two large towels and only one face towel in the closet, not bathroom. They were stingy to give more towels and would only provide one additional face towel since some towels were already in the room. -We did not have even one bar of soap in our room when we arrived, which is just ridiculous. Every room should be prepared in the same way. -One lamp was so old that it would not turn off unless you unplugged it. -In the bathroom, there was no holder for the toilet tissue. The roles were stacked on the toilet's tank lid. That is just vulgar. -You are subject to the air conditioning they decide to blast or turn off for the entire building, so it goes from freezing to humid and hot, back to freezing throughout the day and night. -There are no phones in the room, only a stupid hall phone...that's just stupid. Make sure you take your cell phone or else forget about it. -There is no personal shampoo, conditioner or lotion for guests. There are two dispensers that were filled who the heck knows how long ago with shampoo and conditioner to use, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disgusting too. Yuck. So, really the only comfortable thing about the hotel was that the room and bathroom were both clean. The convenience to the beach is nice; however, it's a filthy beach. Everyone seems to be littering regrettably. The extra time is not taken by the hotel's staff to make sure each room is prepared for guests prior to their arrival. Toilet tissue should have a proper holder and not be stacked on top of the tank like some disgusting public bathroom. That's lazy, inconvenient and very vulgar. Guests should have adequate amounts of soap and towels already in the room, and be provided what they require throughout their stay regardless of how many towels were already in the room. I never asked for housekeeping services to clean my room while there because I did not want to be possibly charged a fee for whatever. After requesting soap and only allowed one more face towel, I saw how unprepared, cheap and stingy they were, I did not want to possibly in anyway acquire any service fees to be charged to my room. The Vendig Street this hotel is located on is not a place necessarily for families. It is filthy as is the beach this hotel is located directly next to. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very urban, which means it's dirty and not a place you would want to walk after sunset with your family. There was a huge pile of smelly trash that stayed on the sidewalk even after the trash collectors came. No one ever picked it up and I'm sure if you go there today, you'll see a pile of trash to the left of the hotel that will still be there. If you are not willing to pay a little higher for a view of the ocean, with the hotel being as small as it is with only 5 floors, your view will be horrible. There will not be a beautiful city view at all. The street is very narrow, so if you do not have to drive there, I'd recommend that you do not bring a car. The area is very urban and very, very gay friendly. I had read that before I came, but was really surprised how gay friendly it is. This is their beach, so just be prepared if you are bringing family members who find that lifestyle unacceptable. When I say it is their beach, I seriously mean it. If you do not respect that lifestyle or live it, this will be quite a surprise. Everyone is super friendly, but you do have to prepare yourself if you are not used to seeing the gay lifestyle outwardly in public. Condado is the gay South Beach, gay Greenwich Village of Puerto Rico. I adore Puerto Rico and hope to return. However, this hotel is not worth the $89 to $118 ocean view price...not at all. The renovations truly suck because they are not renovating the entire building, hallways, rooms, etc. Go to a major chain, find a deal on hotwire or wherever and do not stay here. They have put no work into the old elevator, which we did not take. They have put minimal work into the hall ways. They need to do a ton more. San Juan is full of boutique hotels that are super fabulous and this one has potential, but I think they are cutting too many corners and will never be able to compete with the other nicer boutique hotels in the area until they take the extra effort in making sure every room is prepared properly and that down to the even the smallest details of each room, things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go ignored. No one wants to see no holder for toilet tissue in their bathroom and no soap\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply disgusting and very lazy on their part. If they are not checking the quality of each room after the room has been cleaned, there are no checks and balances, and that shows. It also makes you wonder, how \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was the room really? It appeared clean, but as I said if the manager or a housekeeping supervisor is not checking the quality of each room after cleaned, especially in such a small hotel, then this is questionable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen that done in other hotels in Puerto Rico where we had to wait for the supervisor to approve the cleanliness and the overall preparation of our room before we could even enter. Again, they are cutting too many corners and whoever the owner is, he or she is not taking the extra time to really make this hotel one of a kind, nor making sure it is comparable to other boutique hotels that make you say, WOW!

Cable on a small flat screen mounted to the wall. It rained a little but it didn't stop our flow. Right on the beach which was a plus. Area was safe for walking around. Room service was on point. Beach lounges and umbrellas were set up with no problem. The staff was very helpful, not rude at all, well at least not to us. They gave us recommmendations, directions, called cabs with no problem at all. The bar was closed for the most part but it gave us a chance to go drink with the locals! We went to the one across from La Concha Resort and got wasted (shots were $2) then went across to La Concha and partied (their drinks started at $9) there is also a Walgreens, Haagen Daz, Subways, Dunkin Doughnuts for those that want a lil taste of home all within 2 blocks of the hotel. The cons: you have to pay a $100 deposit, which we were never informed about prior to, but we paid cash so were refunded when we checked out (which was such a fast easy process) and if you want a beach towel that is also a deposit. Also it seems to be a known gay beach, but it didn't bother us at all. Slushy island drinks were served to us on the beach for only $3 (liquor)and while we went to many referred restaurants the one we found to be the best was at a mom& pop spot called \"Stop& Go\" across the lil park from La Concha Resort (which is right next door & has a banging bar and casino) which we found strolling around, for a whole meal (rice, beans, meat, salad and drink) was $8! Orozco's was also a good on Ashford ave. Must go to Old San Juan for a taste of history, it won't dissapoint.

Since it was only for one night we decided to stay and have a drink on the terrace. The hotel and the beach below was full of gay men some of them openly displaying affection and others almost making out in full view of everyone on the beach. After a couple of hours the desk clerk come over and informed us that he had one room with an ocean view and if we wanted to take it it would be additional twenty dollars plus tax. The hotel didn't have any service except the bar. No resturant, coffee machine or information where to find anything. The rooms were dark and smelled so we opened the windows just to get fresh air. The elevator was so old that we avoided using it for fear of being trapped. In the morning as my husband was still packing I went downstairs to check out but was informed that as long as my husband was still in the room we could't check out. I then joined our friends on the terrace to have a ciggarette. Shortly after my husband came downstairs and checked out I was called to the front desk and was informed that I would have to pay additional two hundred and fifty dollars because I was smoking in the room and it would costs that much to clean the room.

My husband and I traveled all around the world and have never been accused of something like this. I tried to reason with them but I guess that at this so called hotel the management is always right and they would not let me leave. they decided to lower the fine to one hundred dollars and if we wanted to get to our cruise we had to agree to pay it. I guess when they saw me smoking on the terrace they decided that I was an easy mark for extra cash. I DID NOT SMOKE IN THE ROOM and because our window was open it gave them easy way to obtain extra cash. Since my husband makes a living from people that do not obey the rules (he is a defence attorney) I would never put myslelf in a position that would affect his reputation.

The view and the breeze is just amazing and you are steps away from the beach. The bar is open early and you get few people coming in and out during day,which is confusing because this place has the potential to bring in large crowds just bc of location and size of bar. i think they are missing out on a gold mine because they are not running the bar correctly and their could be a dj working the tables providing entertainment. The drinks, sad 2 say, were not potent enough.---really not even close...they were being measured as if they had limited liquor to ration! There is also too much security going on, locking hotel doors at night and having to wait for someone to come let you in. Really annoying. They need to simplify everything over there..They should realize that people are on vacation and allow visitors. I have many friends in Puerto Rico, none of which were able to come up 2 my room. Very disappointing,as though you are not a responsible adult LASTLY, dont use the elevator. We got stuck in it and it is a scary, antiquated elevator. I dont really think oceanfront hotels have to be 5 star. You are there for the beach, views, and location. I pointed out some of the issues we had, but for the most part i would stay again and am looking forward to doing so.", "Date": "April 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cOkay - but won't go back\u201d", "Author": "mmwatt930", "ReviewID": "UR105867066", "Content": "The good points are - great location, clean, nice shower, decent price.

Perhaps I can clear a few things up. This IS a gay-friendly hotel. The crowd is a comfortable mix of gay and straight people, and the service is fine regardless of sex and gender. Homophobes, stay away, please. As for the comments accusing the staff of bias, I can only assume it has something to do with the fact that there are a lot of gay prostitutes who hang around the hotel, trying to get invited in, and frankly, I wouldn't want to let them in, either. This IS a no frills, budget hotel, and it's a good deal. At this price, if you expect luxury you're setting yourself up for disappointment. I was happy with my room, though the shower dripped and the A/C was a bit too cold (I just opened the window to let some warm air in). The view from my window was worth way more than I paid. In the future, if I go for a romantic vacation, I'll probably stay somewhere nicer and more expensive, but for a quick, cheap weekend on the beach, this is the perfect hotel. The location, on Condado beach, is within a popular tourist area with lots of hotels and restaurants. Oh, and it's ON THE BEACH. Sure, it's on a side street rather than the main road, but it's not exactly off the beaten path and it's not a particularly dangerous area. As I mentioned above, there are some shady characters who hang out outside the hotel, but if you don't mess with them, they don't mess with you. One thing I really loved about this hotel is the bar. The bartenders are super friendly and the beach view is outstanding. It's a really great place to just sit and chat and have a drink without having to get all dressed up and pay a cover. Also, the hotel provides beach chairs and umbrellas to guests, which makes a perfect spot for drinking pina coladas and enjoying the eye candy.

We had booked this place for the following reasons: #1: it's advertised as a \"gay-friendly\" hotel in many sites and gay travel publications, #2: the llocation, right in the center of Condado, #3: the price. To be as objective and real as I can be, I will list the good first: 1. Location: its true, it is righ in fron of what's considered the \"gay beach\" and at the center of all restaurants and shops, but then again, so are the other hotels AND you can still come to the gay beach for free because beaches are all public here. 2. Price: when you are on a budget and not a \"picky\" traveler, all you want is a clean place to sleep and bathe. By the look of the tiles in the bathroom and the furniture in the room you can tell they have done some remodeling. The BAD: where do I even begin?? 1. The staff: when we checked in, no explanation was given to us of what was around or nearby. Also there is one guy we named the \"hotel nazi\" because he keeps an eye on your every move; VERY uncomfortable. Yes, I know I'm gay, I don't need you to keep staring at me like I'm going to start an orgy or something. 2. The rest of the hotel is in serious need of a remodel: the bar is rund down, the elevator seems like it's about to give any minute (very scary!), and the front deskreminds me of a disorganized private investigator's desk from a bad 80's police show: paperwork pinned on boards and stacked all over. There's also a lingering smell of damp rags in that area. I know we are near the beach and all, but really? This is my first impression? 3. BED BUGS!! Every morning i'd wake up with itchy tiny rashes which I thought were due to mosquitoes. Then it ocurred to me to look at my sheets one day, and sure enough, there they were!! Yuck!! Do I needto go on?? 4. Heavy Atmosphere. I've stayed at plenty budget hotels before where I have felt like I've stayed at a 5 star resort because of the friendliness of the staff. Here I felt like I was in a dorm where my every move had to be analyzed in case I became a sex-crazed, out-of-control gay man! Seriously?? Even the locals would agree this is NOT the place to stay if you are a gay client simply because its in front of the gay beach or it has a \"gay-friendly\" bar. I learned my lesson. Next time I will spend a few more dollars and stay somewhere else!! In the mean time, I'm putting the word out there. If you are gay, STAY AWAY!!

My husband and I both thought the hotel looked a little run down and dirty. The lobby was very old looking. We arrived early as we just got off of the cruise ship. We had A LOT of luggage including valuable souvenirs we had purchased as well as a laptop computer. We were told our room would not be ready til around 3 - which was completely understandable. The gentleman told us they would hold our luggage and put tags on it. We were grateful. My husband helped him move our things into a back room which did not seem very secure. So my husband asked \"is our stuff safe here\" to which the man replied \"if not you can take it with you!\" We were just looking for a little reassurance! He could have just assured us that it was secure! Rude! The elevator really, really needed to be wiped down! I don't even mind so much how old it was -- it was dirty and it smelled like mildew! The halls upstairs looked ok, I was hopeful and having seen the photos on their website, I just knew our room would be nice -- NOT! The only thing similar to the photos were the white linens and the bathroom looked pretty updated, although the shower looked dirty! I was SO disappointed with the room! The hotel website DID NOT mention that they were in the process of updating -- I certainly would have requested one of those rooms and my review would be MUCH better! Room 301 - The lamp shades were water warped, TV was tiny with no remote, there was no AC control (very hot room, we had to open the door for a while just to get some air circulation from the hallway), towel had questionable stains, table needed to be cleaned. We went to Walgreen's and bought LYSOL! Sprayed everything in the room and the elevator and the doors! We were woken up several times during the night because of the partying going on just below our window in the patio bar but especially because of the LOUD guests in the hallways. This was a very noisy place. You can not swim in the water behind this hotel because there are big rocks, you have to walk down to other hotels and even at that there are signs warning you not to go into the water due to strong current. If you have kids, especially BE AWARE of this -- my husband is a very tall and strong man and the currents pulled him out with ease! As far as the comments I've read about prostitution as well homosexuals; There were a lot of questionable looking men right outside the door but I'm pretty sure that's a public area so I can't necessarily blame the hotel for that, if they were prostitutes even. However we made the decision not to be out at night as I did not feel safe! But during the day we liked it! Shopping was good, restaurants, etc. We figured out that this was a place where gays frequented and at first it was awkward because we're not \"urban\" people so we're rarely around that. But it didn't bother us at all, everyone seemed to mind their own business! Also the hotel charged us a fifty dollar deposit in addition to the night's rate which they did not tell us about. I didn't like that. The gentleman that worked the desk in the evening hours, older with glasses, used to be in the Navy - he was great, very nice, always smiling told us about the remodeling which made a lot of sense to us! He made sure I was able to connect to the internet with my computer! To the management/owner of the hotel I would like to say to you that instead of always making excuses for the things people did not like at your property, If you would just be forthcoming with things and at least consider making changes and stop blaming your guests for the mistakes, I think it would make your property a lot better.

This was one of our favorite locations. We planned to stay at the Atlantic Beach at the beginning and end of our stay but due to problems with storms on the East Coast, we had to cancel our initial reservations at the Atlantic Beach. Because we did so within their deadline (two days in advance) and in writing (by email), they were fine with accommodating our change in plans. So finally we only stayed there two nights. It would have been easy to stay longer at such a great location. The good: Our ocean-view room felt like it was in the surf. AMAZING. The first night we left our windows open at first, and I realized I would never sleep, the roar of the ocean was so loud. But when we closed the windows, the ocean sound was perfect. The building has central AC so closing the windows wasn't a problem. The rooms are small but clean, the bathrooms likewise ( though with good-sized showers - no tub). The not-so-good: Our room was next to the stairs so I was awakened by doors opening and closing and a few people talking loudly. One thing the hotel could fix would be the 1st-floor door which tends to slam. The door on our floor had a hydraulic closer to keep it quiet, hooray . The beds were fine but a little short for 6'1\" me. The elevator is old and rather loud too. If you are driving, parking is a little challenging, though the hotel helps you to work it out. We didn't use our car much because we weren't sure there'd be a spot for us when we returned - though there are parking garages nearby. The beach: The hotel provides beach chairs with an attendant so you can leave your stuff and go play in the surf. In February, the surt was pretty intense with a significant undertow and cross-currents. I had a lot of fun swimming in it but still had a couple of disoriented moments. My partner isn't a strong swimmer so I was glad that he mostly wanted to sunbathe. I found a couple of buddies to swim with so that somebody was paying attention if I ran into trouble. If I had kids, I wouldn't let them in the water, at least not at this time of year. When you come up stairs from the beach to the terrace bar, there is a place to rinse your feet, but it would be nice to have a shower there as well. The bar: We're a gay couple and enjoyed meeting people at the terrace bar downstairs which is right above the beach (a fun place to watch surfers). It was a mixed crowd, mostly gay men but not exclusively. The bartenders were friendly and attentive and the drinks were reasonable (especially during happy hour). There is a second terrace on the top floor of the building that we pretty much had to ourselves - super view! Would be nice to see it get renovated and used more. It has its own bathroom and shower as well as laundry facilities (washer, dryer, iron and ironing board - could use some attention). The area: Condado is close to everything - Old San Juan, the Plaza de Las Americas, etc. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance. We also walked to some gay bars in Santurce. You need to be street-smart to do that, but otherwise it's not a big deal, there are quite a few places to check out .

Boy was I was wrong. It all started with a lazy laissez-faire attitude of their staff and their web booking engine. Not only was it a non-secure site, it was not functional. The site is not Macintosh friendly, so I tried booking on Windows. I had to call them twice to remedy the problem before I could finally book for a simple overnight (Thursday around midnight going into Friday morning). Upon checking in, we thought we would have a nightcap at the patio bar before going upstairs. We then encountered a bunch of noisy gringos (20-something, brassy, sassy, loud, unrespectful, monolingual, obnoxious -- the stereotypical ugly American). After a quick gulp of the cocktail, we immediately left for the room (302). Avoid this room at all cost. The window was painted shut (and so was the subsequent relocated room) and the air vent was not functioning. They had the gall to ask me another US$100 for an upgrade to a bigger room, even when I'm only there for one night and the room was available. So, as a compromise, they moved us to 308. Got a loud awakening at 5am when the neighbors waddled into their rooms drunk (hallway and doors not noiseproof). The management mentioned there's an outside shower facility by the upstairs sundeck (sheltered). They allowed this for guest use, great particularly for late departing guests (flight at 8pm). Unfortunately, because of the storm, the shower curtain flailed everywhere, making it almost impossible to take a shower. No towels, soap or shampoo were provided (thank goodness I asked housekeeping earlier in the morning). Be sure you shower with some flip-flops... pebbles and sand everywhere. The patio area is also filled with broken glass. Only saving graces are free WiFi and the patio bar at the lobby. At US$105 per night plus an additional $40 in cabfare, I would almost prefer sleeping over at the YMCA or at a coushsurfing.com host.

Therefore, I left a much nicer, yet less expensive hotel a block away to be at the Atlantic Beach Hotel. Within minutes of checking in, my wallet, credit cards and all indentification cards were stolen from me in the middle of the day near the bar area of the hotel. It is not that I hold the hotel responsible for this (however, one would like to think that he/she was safe at the hotel), I got absolutely no assistance from them and had to seek out the police to file a report on my own (not that they were anymore concerned than the Atlantic Beach management and staff). Luckily the hotel had secured a credit card hold for my room. And although they had secured a much higher limit than the rooom rate, they absolutely refused to add a incidental (taxi fare) to the room charge to get me back to the airport. Basically I was stranded and it was the hotel's attitude and lack of concern that bothered me, especially since the theft took place on their property. The next morning when I did check out and tried again to get the hotel to add the incidental (taxi fare) to the ticket before it was closed out, the lady would not, nor would she call the manager to get apporval to do it. When she gave me their copy of my room charges for me to sign, I wrote on it that my credit cards, money and ID's had been stolen while staying there. The lady got furious at this and started yelling. After being told that the room had been billed successfully to my credit card, I had had enough of the Atlantic Beach Hotel and staff. I left without being given a copy of my room charges. It was my decision to leave a better hotel a block away to stay at the Atlantic Beach Hotel. And if it had not been for the theft, I would have accepted everything, even the extremely small, poor condition, over-priced rooms and would have had a good time! It's just the NO-CARE attitude from the management toward their guests is bothersome. One other issue I had was trying to get back up to my room as guests have to be buzzed back in. However, the desk staff were never at the desk and were out on the street talking to other people. Once inside, I felt like I was in a high school dorm on lockdown as guest are not allowed upstairs. You can not despute that the hotel is in a great location and that the bar area is fun and that the barbacks are the BEST.

I read all the reviews before booking a room so I called the hotel and addressed it THREE different times to make sure we would not encounter any of the things I read. They were very much aware of the online reviews and they were very concerned about their reputation. I could tell they were genuinely concerned about what I read and they assured me I would enjoy my stay. I actually think I met most of the staff and can name them all by name which would indicate they had a positive impact on our stay. There were four of us so we had two rooms and the hotel staff was right, we did enjoy our stay. Both our rooms were clean, the sheets were clean and anything we needed, the hotel staff took care of it immediately with a smile. The front desk person actually came up to our room shortly after we checked in to make sure our rooms were ok and to see if we needed anything.

They are little things that should be change ASAP like : 1- Ceiling Fans at the lobby 2- Iron board and Iron 3- Just dust the walls of some rooms. I dont know why people mentioned that the staff was rude. Everybody, from the lobby to the bar were very friendly and helpful. The location is great and the bar is right on the beach. Remember this is not a 4 star hotel, but has GREAT potential. The continental breakfast is very good and FREE. The hotel has this rule not to let anybody other than guest go to the rooms for security purposes and I understand that, but also we are adults and we are resposible for our actions. They have a very nice area at the PH level that can be use for many activities, but for some reason they dont use it. I will love to bring some friends and have coctails upstairs. The new bartender Regis (from France) is really, really good and I am sure he will bring many positive things to this hotel. Something else was the drink prices. For bacardi coctails it was a little bit expensive and also the drinks are week. I want to see a littlebit more rum on my Pi\u00c3\u00b1a Colada. For the price that we paid, especially in high Season it was pretty good. Just to seat at the bar looking at the beach its priceless. I think the hotels is going to improve little by little for better. Also they need more than one person for the afternoon, only one person was at the bar and arranging chairs at the beach at the same time. I defenetely recomend the Ocean View rooms. Water pressure was very good for showering and closets were very good size. The beds were very clean as well as pillows. In general it is a nice place to stay, especially for the price. Everybody was very nice and we had a very good time. Also the beach is the best around. Other very pricy hotels around do not have the nice beach out front like the ABH. They also provide you with the beach chairs, umbrella, and towels. One of the managers was always very friendly and making sure we were ok. If you want to spend $300 a night at the MArriott ( room are old anyways) go ahead, but is not worth it. The Atlantic Beach Hotel was good enough for us and we had a lot of fun.
