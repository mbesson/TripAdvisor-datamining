The breakfast was a very nice typical motel continental breakfast of cereals, bagels, toast, 2 kinds of rolls, 2 kinds of muffins, juice, oatmeal-all you need to get you going. We found lots of motels around there have discontinued serving any kind of continental breakfast, so this was a reason we chose staying here. And the location can't be beat. It's across from Old Town, at a stoplight for ease of getting on the road. Many restaurants to walk to, Pulix grocery around the corner, Walgreens, gas station also-all very walkable. We got to Disney in about 8 minutes right down the road. Would definitely stay there again and tell anyone else to if you are looking for a very clean, well maintained, well situated motel that's very reasonably priced.

However more than likely I will not be going back even with the fantastic price. The first room they put me in did have updated everything however the bathroom was very dirty. I asked that they just send someone to clean it but they said they could only have me change rooms as they never had housekeeping on hand that late (it was around 5-6pm). The room they moved me into had an updated vanity area and TV however the tub was yellow from the \"hard water\" (which after living in the area I knew about the water however if I cleaned my tub regularly never had the issue) and the rest of the appliances were quite old. I sat on the beds and they were ridiculously hard and after having so many issues already I went to the front desk. The man there was incredibly condescending, saying he'd never had a complaint before me and that these beds were brand new and pillow top (not sure what pillow top that was, I had to use a pillow under my waist the entire trip to be remotely comfortable). I knew I wouldn't get my money back as I had done pre-payment so I just sucked it up and went back to the room. Every night I was woken up at ridiculous hours thanks to the Publix trucks that would deliver food and other items very early in the morning. I stayed in the courtyard \"view\" area - please don't make my mistake. Take something that faces the parking lot. The main portion of the hotel is on a rather deserted road and it would be MUCH quieter in that section. Wifi was come and go. I had to continually restart the internet thanks to issues with the router. They did have multiple routers throughout the hotel though so when the wifi worked, it did work well. Housekeeping would continually shut off the AC during the day (which if you know Florida, even in November that can make a room stifling hot by the end of the day) however I had no issues with things being moved excessively during my stay. There were a few issues with towels though, one night I came in to find a towel had been folded with some sort of hair/body grime ball attached to the towel (which would have been plain for anyone to see, it was a very large thing). However when I spoke with the front desk about this, a different young man was very helpful and apologized profusely. Anytime I needed help with an issue he was there and on the ball.

One bus stop is in front of the hotel (The other across the street) and it took us right to the Ticket & Transportation Center (Link #56). Buses run every 30 minutes (from 6 a.m-11:30 p.m.) and cost $2 per person (not the $1 stated on the Super 8 website), one way. There is a small pool (with a restroom & soda machine) in the parking lot (enclosed by a tall fence, with a handful of plastic deck chairs), as well as washers, dryers, and an ice machine on the second floor. Washing costs $2 per load, drying $1.50. Breakfast consisted of muffins, toast, pastries, coffee, juice, cereal, milk, but if you walk across the parking lot to Sizzlin Grill (on the other side of Denny's), you can get a good all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet for $3.99 per person. We ate there several times! The rooms are standard issue, but very clean, and the beds are comfortable, and the a/c unit was easy to manage; it was also nice to have a microwave and fridge in the room. The maid service was very honest and thorough, and even folded my kids' pajamas and put their stuffed animals on the pillows! The front-desk staff was friendly and never had a problem with my asking for quarters for the washer/dryer (you can also purchase sodas or laundry supplies from them for $1 each) or when I needed extra cups or $1s for the bus. If looking for cheap Florida souvenirs, there are two places between Sizzlin Grill and a McDonalds, all located on the same side as this hotel.

Breakfast included some packaged bagels and small muffins and some cereal, but it was good enough for us. One of the biggest draws of this hotel was that the city bus stopped right in front of it. A quick walk to the bus stop and 15 minutes later, we were at the Disney transportation center. This was great for us as we didn't rent a car and realized that it would have been a waste of money if we had. Very convenient to get to Disneyworld with the city bus at 2 bucks each way. However, if you want to get to Universal, you will probably need to take a taxi or rent a car. We were on the side of the hotel with the Publix and the trucks did start their deliveries around 5AM or so. If you are a light sleeper, I do not recommend this side.

Seriously? Is it really necessary to nickel-and-dime your customers this way? While this isn't as absurd as some of the resort fees charged by many motels and hotels in the area, in a way it's worse because guests are less likely to complain about it. After all, it's less than $2 per night, right? However, if you multiply this fee by the number of booked room-nights in a month's period, it makes for a tidy extra profit for the motel. Because it's a lower end property competing with other similar properties, a couple of bucks per night more might make someone book elsewhere, so I guess the answer is to just screw your customers by charging a hidden fee. When I emailed the property asking if they would waive the fee for my one night's stay, I received no response, so I cancelled my reservation and booked elsewhere.

The management is so proud of it that it has a flat screen tv at the reception counter, showing the nice pictures of the room. If you buy the idea ...that's it... Now, let me share the pain we've gone through. When we entered the room, it smelled musty. The room interior is refurbished but not the toilet, the steel handle in the bath tub is rusted. Now come to the most important part that bothered us, the bedding! We were so surprised when we look at the pillows. We have 2 Queen beds, 2 pillows on each bed. All four of them are of different sizes and material made. All covered by pillow cases that have gone through perhaps thousand wash cycle, as thin as 1 ply of tissue paper. The colour has changed to grayish white. The pillow cases is 2 sizes smaller than the pillow, so...you can imagine, the pillows looked squashed like lumpy sausages with thin and disgusting looking pillow cases. The blankets are the thin brown one, with one layer of white sheet underneath. and again, the white sheets are not white and as thin as 1 ply of tissue paper, I called the front desk, I was willing to pay for an upgrade, if a better pillow cases and blankets covers are used in the poolside room. I was told the whole property use the same quality of bedding. I wanted to cancel my stay, but no refund was allowed. We have paid for 6 nites. Because of that, we have to stay on. The front desk said, the most he could do was giving me another 2 pillow cases and 2 more white sheets for the blankets. We collected from the front desk....true..what we got from him is the same as those in the room. Throughout our 7 days stay, there was one or 2 days we were lucky to get pillow cases which are a little bit whiter, or bigger in sizes. But most of the days, we get back the poor thin one. There is no consistency If you stay for only one nite and you are lucky to get the not so bad beddings, may be you will feel better than us. Another thing, the base unit of the bed (divan) has no cover, may be it is to save cost, another thing is perhaps it's for showing off the brand of the beds. One more important thing, the aircond has no control of fan speed, so, it will blow right to your face while sleeping on the bed. We got sick because of that. The air from the aircond smells musty too Now, for breakfast. I think breakfast here is the most \"budget minded\" one that we have ever encountered. 2 type of cheapest cereal and cold milk. packed small muffin, sweet danish and bagel. White bread, butter , jam and cream cheese. Coffee & tea, no hot chocolate. Apple & orange juice from the machine. We ate bagel with butter everyday. I did come across bagel that's as hard as rock which I had to throw it away. The other reviewer is true, the management has no concern for the guests. They have a lot more to learn about good attitude in hospitality. We are your paying guests, we are not baggers.

The supermarket ENTRANCE is across a parking lot from this hotel, but the back of the store is just a couple yards from the \"courtyard\" rooms. It's much closer than the reviews made it sound. The delivery trucks come at all times of the night and early morning. There are also stores and restaurants extremely close which seemed to have frequent garbage pickup. These trucks all have those loud backing warning sounds which penetrate the rooms even more than the banging and other noises. Normally we drown out noise with the a/c or fan, but that was as bad as the trucks if not worse. I have never stayed in a motel with such a loud a/c unit. We couldn't sleep with it on, not even just with the fan blowing. I am sure that staying poolside is a completely different experience. Pay the extra money for a room on that side if you plan to stay here. The staff was great. The room was large and modern. The breakfast wasn't worth the trip to the office, but the Publix had plenty of variety and there was a Denny's a couple yards in front of the motel. The pool wasn't open when we did want to use it. A sign said it was closed due to wet paint. That was disappointing but didn't spoil our stay. The location of the motel was great. It was a short easy drive to Sea World, Magic Kingdom, and Downtown Disney. I'd say everything in the other reviews is accurate, but I didn't realize the noise on the courtyard side would spoil our stay.

The hotel is situated in a decent location. We traveled to Sea World and Disney Magic Kingdom and Downtown from here - and the location is convenient. In the same compound they have Bennigans and Dennys, and a large Publix supermarket. There is also a Walgreens outlet within walking distance. 2. The room was large. 3. The room is obviuosly refurbished and looks good with nice furniture. Had a large flat screen LCD TV. Now the negatives: 1. The heater was erratic. It was COLD in Orlando when we stayed there - temperature varied between 30s and 50s throughout the day. And the first night the heater hardly worked. We did not have any problems from the next day onwards though. 2. The towels provided were worn out and some of them were stained. 3. They charge you $1/day for a safe in the room. While I feel that is accepted, it is unethical not to mention that upfront at the time of reservation . I was surprised but still accepted the charge thinking that I could use the same to store our passports and the laptop, which we originally did not plan to. However, the safe did not work. I mentioned this at the time of check-out to the person at the desk. However he still charged me for the safe saying that I should have called him up when it did not work. How much time should I spend on something which I had not even wanted? I found this entire thing very immoral and unacceptable. At just for a dollar a day, I call it \"Penny wise pound foolosh\". 4. This can be considered as my own fault. Room on the second floor, no elevator, lots of luggage. I had a hard time taking the suitcases up and down. 5. Breakfast was very basic. Coffee, Juice, Milk and cheerios, bread and danish. 6. The swimming pool is a joke for the size of the hotel. While we were there, there was no scope of using it, though. However, looking at the location, size of room and cleanliness, I would still recommend this to my fellow travelers.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "kent", "Title": "\u201cgreat value in super location\u201d", "Author": "KentRatchet", "ReviewID": "UR55388131", "Content": "After staying in the same location in a couple of very run down hotels, how refreshing it was to find such a clean and modern hotel at such a great rate.

We decided that we'd go the Value Route this time. Having read the T.A. reviews, I felt confident that we wouldn't be encountering any bugs in this motel, and my feelings proved true. In a day and age when even the best of hotels and motels are getting reviews of having critters, looking for a \"bug-less\" hotel has been my number one criteria when searching for a place to stay. I get heebie geebies just thinking what is \"out there\". This small motel right across from Old Town proved to be 100 PERCENT BUG FREE! It was also VERY CLEAN. The carpet was so new, that I actually walked barefoot on it... something I don't often do away from home. It gets 5 stars for cleanliness and bug-free. Is it a \"resort\"? No, not at all. Just a nice comfy, clean place to lay your head. It had a nice flat screen with what seemed to be a nice sound system / speakers. The fridge was a plus. Had a hair dryer as well. It definitely has been recently renovated, and we were pleased with everything... especially the price (around $40 a night). If you want to spend your vacation lounging around the pool, this is not for you. The pool is VERY SMALL, and located IN THE PARKING LOT on the side of the building! There wasn't enough room for lounge chairs in this tiny area, but they do have some chairs and a table with umbrella. The chairs at the pool seemed to be relatively new as well, but nowhere to \"lay out\" for a tan. In summary, If all you need is a place to lay your head, while going on to spend your day at theme parks, meetings, or otherwise, then this is a great bang for your buck. Most people's stays in Orlando and Kissimmee are filled with theme parks, shows at night, dining out, etc, so if that's the case, who cares what ammenities are at your motel, as long as you have a comfy and clean place to lay your head at night? I didn't check out the breakfast area, but they did have one. My brother in law had a few cups of their coffee in the morning and said it was fine. I don't know of another hotel so convenient to Disney that has rooms at this price that are not buggy, dirty or just plain worn out, or worse yet, are in areas of high crime. This motel was in a safe area, had pleasant staff, right next to a Denny's and a Publix, and convenient to EVERYTHING! Unless you are looking for luxury, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amberg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cSorry I tipped the maids\u201d", "Author": "oktoberfest", "ReviewID": "UR27835568", "Content": "Rooms were good for the money we paid.BUt we forgot a bag with bradnew stuff from Abercrombie&Fitch(125$) in our room, called 2 days later- nothing, we should call 2 hours later,we did.

Our room was recently and tastefully renovated, and everything was spotless. Nice flat screen TV, comfortable beds, and we made great use of the microwave and refrigerator. Continental breakfast was offered, but we never got it since we brought our own food. 5 minutes to Disney, and located within walking distance of many restaurants and shops. The rooms were on the small side, so for a family of four, I think it might feel cramped after awhile. However, it was perfect for me and my husband. There was some construction work going on next door which began quite early in the morning. Also, the Harley shop got a bit noisy. If you ask for a room in the back corner of the building (on the same side of the building as the pool, just farther back from the highway), I think that would probably be quieter.

When we checked into the hotel, the manager told us that we owed more then what was listed on our confirmation email from the hotel. This was not a good way to welcome a guest, and he should have honored the email I showed him that was sent to me when we booked over the phone which had the price plainly listed. My wife wanted to call corporate immediately, but since it was Xmas day they were not open and finding another hotel on the spot would have been difficult and probably more pricey. The following day I received a message from the front desk that they had made a mistake and gave us the difference in money back. The room was very clean & modern with nice Silver/Black accents on the furniture and a very nice 32' Vizio LCD TV. Maids cleaned the room daily and we tipped them for the quality job they did. The drive to the Disney parks was only a few minutes away and the traffic was not bad at all. We have stayed on Disney property before, but even the Value Resorts will cost you around $100/night.

It's just over the road from the old town, plenty of parking right out front in full view of the reception desk and free coffee/muffins/toast in reception in the morning. There are supermarkets nearby and the room had two very large double beds so a much, much cheaper alternative to a villa if there are a few of you. The only downsides were carrying our heavy cases up the stairs and the walkway outside the doors could have done with a good scrub. Inside the room was faultless. The aircon worked really well and there was a coin op laundry which was ideal for drying out our clothes after getting soaked at the parks during the day.

The reception stay were very friendly and helpful all the time and the rooms were immaculate. There are only 2 minor reasons why I haven't given this place a 5/5 rating. The first is the breakfast which is very basic, it's just bagels, cofffee and a couple of cereals, but to be fair it is a 'complimentary' breakfast so we couldn't really complain. And the second reason is the location of the pool, it's right in the middle of the carpark! We paid an extra $5 per night to have poolside not realising that it is surrounded by cars half the time!
