It's also fun to leisurely walk from the Columbus Monument on La Rambla up to Plaza de Catalunya. Be sure to stop and rest at a cafe. Paseo de Gracia is only 3 blocks away and has lots of shops and restaurants. I had a corner room, which I loved, but there is city noise if you open the windows. There was only one night when the air conditioning was down for the whole hotel and one night when the phone service was out for awhile. The neighborhood is very nice and it was fun to walk to the shops at the corner of Valencia - bakery, cheese, wine, flower shop. Also a convenience store just around the corner. There's a school almost next door and when the kids got out, it reminded me a lot of the Upper East Side in NYC. Service at the bar seemed very spotty. Three of us wanted a drink before dinner one night and no one was there until another group came in. Suddenly a bartender appeared.. The main disadvantage was that CNN did not come in in my room. Most people in our group did get it and every day I was told that it would be looked at - even when the next day was that person's day off.

The rooms are limited in space, yet, clean. The view is on the internal hotel space, and the breakfast buffet is not bad. The staff at the hotel reception is nice, and friendly. The location of the hotel is average, it's not far from Catalonia Square, the main destination for many activities, however, it's not very near also, it takes from 15-20 minutes walking and for me, with a child, it was daily discomfort in going out and getting back. One of the major negative points is that they charge you for using the safety deposit box in your room, something I did not ever experience in any other hotel.

We paid 19 euros for 24h00 3. although the buffet breakfast was included in my booking via Expedia, we could have the breakfast delivered in the room without extra cost 4. very clean room and bathroom, good light and excellent insulation to prevent from the traffic noise (two double glazed windows !) Negative aspects : 1. the bed was not very good and check it, we couldn't believe what we discovered, provided the price of the room and the 4 stars category (see picture). As we were there for just one night we didn't want to move when discovered that at night just before going to bed so we informed the hotel when checking out. I don't know if that will be changed but they didn't seem to really care. No discount, no excuses, no nothing. 2. at 2.30 am we woke up because someone was trying to enter the room and bang the door several times. I call the reception, in the meantime the person bang the door again, the hotel security came (we didn't open the door and made silence of course). And we waited, a bit anxious of course. Nothing, no news. I called reception again and the security person said \"nobody there\". I insisted and finally, the security admitted that he saw someone going OUT of the hotel right when he got back at reception. Scary. As a summary I would not go back for this hotel in Barcelona cause there are other options in the same area, for exemple, the Gallery Hotel where our one night stay was fantastic for an extra cost of 17 euros which were reaaaally worth it.", "Date": "May 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cnice put expensive\u201d", "Author": "Tsaraiva", "ReviewID": "UR8688610", "Content": "Hotel Berna is a nice hotel fairly central to Barcelona, in a quiet area.

Professional not intrusive. Room was very nice, kind of new interior. Well isolated from the possible noises from the boulevard. Bathroom clean. On my last evening there (spent 3 nights) a staff member even came to knock on my door and gave me a chocolate. they did the same to the rest of our group staying there. Breakfast was really really good, lot of choice, tasty and plenty! On the negatives: Internet connection is really expensive. Room rate is fairly high. We got a discount as a group but still high to my eyes (would have been OK if internet connection included). A few bits and pieces to fix (nothing major: TV remote, bath extraction) but I guess it was just my room as the others were ok. Overall a very good stay.

I booked this hotel on [--] for a four day sightseeing trip to Barca. I paid \u00a3350 for four nights (2 people) including breakfast and taxes. The hotel is in a great location only 5 minutes walk from the best shops in town. Prada, Gucci, Armani etc etc. Placa Catalonia is only 10 mins away too so that was spot on. The hotel itself was good, rooms were not very big but spotless and cleaned everyday. Lovely fresh towels and a superb bath and monsterously powewrful shower. Breakfast was superb and served 7am to 10:30am so good for early risers and those who have a few beers the night before. If you love your tea take some of your own english teabags as those served at breakfast were rubbish. We had the set menu in the restaurant one night and it was really nice. Three courses, including really fresh seafood, water, wine and bread for only 18 Euros each. We both felt it was well worth it. The only critisisms I have is that the room doors slam shut when people arrive/leave. This was particulary annoying at 6am when some people left early. Our door was the same and if you didn't control the door as you left it would slam behaind you due to not having those bracket type things that slowly close most doors. Also when I was there the air conditioning was not working in the room which got quite warm at night. I was told at reception that it does operate at this time of year. (March) I would have liked it on. The hotel is on a busy junction but the traffic noice is completely cancelled out by the double set of windows so this was not a problem. Overall, I would stay again if they sorted out the slamming doors on the 5th floor.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location\u201d", "Author": "Truand", "ReviewID": "UR6916272", "Content": "We have just come back from a wonderful 4 day break staying at the Catalonia Berna.

The major plus point is location, you are in walking distance of the major tourist attractions metro stations and buses, which really allow you to explore the city. Do go into Gaudi's Casa Mila which is well worth the 8 euro's We found the rooms to be spotless, cleaned daily, good size and the staff friendly and efficient. The buffet breakfast was ample and the service was good. Didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening ( does anybody) so can't comment.. One point of caution is to try and get a room facing out ward as the the inner rooms can be viewed from the glass lifts as they travel up and down which could be a bit embarassing if you forget to pull the curtains.
