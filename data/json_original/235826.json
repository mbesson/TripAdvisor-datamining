The rooms are very small, and much smaller the bathroom.... The walls of the restroom were duty, like with mildew, rust, and paint chipping. Beds some what hard.

The front desk people really don't speak English. We were lucky because they spoke better in Spanish which we know. This hotel is very very basic!!!! There is no TV, no radio, no elevator.

Our room was a fine size but the bathroom was smaller than a cruise ship bathroom. I did not mind, but my husband did not care for the tiny shower. The rooms were very clean and well maintained for a very old building. I really enjoyed watching the apartments across the ally from us. It was great to watch locals going about every day life, hanging their laundry and cooking. I know, it sounds nosey. The small ally that this hotel is down is very small and easy to miss, so you have to pay attention the first time you look for it, but it is very quiet at night. The hotel is very close to the bus and train station which is why we picked it. We did not want to carry our luggage too far. It is a very convenient location.

We never had a problem getting it. We all enjoyed the breakfast. Drinks were hot cocoa, coffee and water. The 2 guys mixed the coffee and cocoa for a mocha type drink that they enjoyed.

The rooms are basic but totally fine and the beds were comfortable. A breakfast of coffee, bread and jam is included. The front desk people were generally helpful with inquiries about how to get around the city. But everything else about our stay was a comedy of errors and even though I wouldn't say \"don't stay at Hotel Rossi,\" I probably won't reward them with my business again. I contacted the hotel in December about a 3 night stay in May. We requested a single room with two beds and they confirmed our reservation. When we arrived we were told that they did not have the room we requested. They explained that the mix up was because I had booked so far in advance! Something about how they don't actually open till March. As best as I understood it, they just replied 'yes' to me and to other guests, and then figured they'd work out the details later, when they opened. Unsurprisingly, it didn't all work out. Since they were going to give us 2 rooms for the first night (at the originally agreed upon price) and then switch us to our originally requested room, I didn't make a big deal about it. But I was awfully annoyed with the repeated statements \"you see it is not our fault.\" Because I actually don't see that and I certainly don't want to hear it over and over again. So they gave us two rooms on the 3rd and 4th floors. The 4th floor room was incredibly small and there was no bathroom on that floor at all. But even that we could have dealt with if the room itself weren't the temperature of a sauna. At first we thought it was just because it was a warm day so we opened the window as wide as possible. But then I realized the heater was warm. We called down to the front desk to ask if there was any way it could be on and how we could turn it off. No, we were told that the heat was not on. As we left for dinner, we encouraged him to check out the room--it was truly unbearably hot. He said he would of course check, but that of course the heat was not on. When we came back there was a different person at the desk and the room was just as hot. You truly could not sleep there. We didn't feel like dealing with the front desk so we just so we moved everything back to the other room and dealt with the single bed. On our way out for the day we told them we couldn't sleep in the room and received a shrug in response. Only when we returned later did he tell us that yes, it turns out we were right. The boiler was broken and stuck in the \"on\" position. But it was Sunday so there probably wouldn't be any repairs that day. We let it go because we were being moved to a different room. Although that one wound up being quite warm as well, we were just happy to be in our originally requested room at last. After a long day of walking and sight seeing, we went back to our rooms to relax. A couple of hours later I was just starting to fall asleep (admittedly early but it was probably around 10 pm) when the phone rang and woke me up. The reception desk wanted to know how many days we were staying. Were we leaving tomorrow? No, we told them we intended to stay three nights--as we arranged when we made our reservations! Why were they calling us at 10 pm when they saw us retire to our room 2 hours before (and they did see us because they keep all room keys at the front desk)? I was starting to feel that Hotel Rossi was determined I not sleep soundly and comfortably in their establishment. The next night, Monday, the boiler still wasn't fixed. But the windows and the ceiling fan and an evening rain kept us cool enough. When we paid I kind of wanted to hassle the management for a discount but I just didn't have the energy. They certainly didn't offer any discounts. There are lots of reasons for people to stay at Hotel Rossi. I doubt all the things that went wrong with our stay are likely to repeat for anyone else.

Rooms: Comfortable enough, though ours was a bit cramped. Breakfast: Horrible, a few stale rolls and terrible coffee. Value: Excellent, at 65 Euro, we feel this was a great deal for Venice. Overall, this was a good choice for us, because we weren't willing to pay much for our one night in Venice - we knew we'd hardly even be in the room. But if you're looking for more than a bed (or good breakfast) - go somewhere else.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Rossi", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d235826-Reviews-Hotel_Rossi-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$106 - $152*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Lista di Spagna, 262</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Cannaregio</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30121</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "235826", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/3/3/7/4/144733/144733.jpg"}}
