{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Just average.. Stayed there for the first time as I had to do business in the area.Normally I stay always in the center of Frankfurt. When I arrived the check in was ok but nobody offered to help me with the luggage.The room decoration is boring a typical decoration as most of the american type hotels have but the size of the room was good and the bed was big and comfortable also.The problem was an old aircondition they have in the room which makes a lot of noise but no cool air..was more like a fan..when I called the reception an older guy replied and said that I just have to wait 2 hours more as around 23:00 o' clock the aircondition will be shut down and I will be able to sleep.. no comments!He did not offer to send somebody in order to check the aircon or to offer me another room with a better working Air Condition.I liked very much the room service afterwards as they were quick and very kind and the burger was perfect.Also the breakfast was really good like i am used in Germany and even better.Very expensive WIFI cost 8 euro per hour and it is not possible to use it from a standard room but only downstairs at the lobby.In order to get connected from your room you have to take out the cable from the phone etc.How can they be a business hotel having an ancient internet technology? Overall a quite good middleclass hotel to stay if they fix the aircon and put some wireless stations in the floors.", "Date": "Aug 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR599628457", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Pantheo36"}, {"Content": "Wonderful hotel and staff We can't say enough good things about the manager Ulf and his staff. We were difficult travellers, having 100kgs of luggage from mountaineering expeditions with us. Half of that needed to be sent home to the US, and other half kept here and washed. It was no problem to find us boxes and arrange the shipping for us. Also, it was no problem for them to direct us to a laundromat with our ton of clothing (that they could have profited from at the hotel). Our room was very clean and quiet, with a wondeful view of the surrounding forest trails (it was great watching the landing aircraft into FRA).

Basically, the hotel is fine if you have a meeting with the business park (Nestle etc.) where it exists outside of Frankfurt proper. Other than that, STAY AWAY.1) Had to change room after first night due to completely lame a/c. They brought a fan to my room! I thought this is a $325 room and my a/c is a fan?2) The lobby bar/lounge service is very lazy and again, the air is STILL and very hot. Overheard other Americans saying the same thing.3) Returned to room after a business day at 3:15pm and room had not been cleaned. I told them I would sit in the lobby while room was cleaned since I had business to attend to.4) Hotel is approximately 20 euros by taxi from town center or popular exhibition space Messe Frankfurt.

I chose this hotel due to the location near to the Messe Frankfurt Fairgrounds (about 17 euros each way via taxi, according to the front desk staff there was no direct shuttle service from the hotel). If you are going to downtown Frankfurt, there is a tram stop directly across from the hotel (Niederrad-Burostadt), the ride is about 20 minutes. The Sheraton Congress offered friendly service and clean rooms, as I have come to expect from all the Starwood brands. That being said, 345 euros per night for a room of approximately 150 - 175 square feet with a small double bed was not worth the cost.

The hotel was typical for a Sheraton - decent sized rooms, good breakfast, clean - but nothing exceptional. It serves as a good airport hotel if you have an early flight connection, but I wouldn't stay here if you are planning on exploring Frankfurt.The biggest drawback is that it doesn't have an airport shuttle. A taxi was Eur 13 from the airport, even though it's only a few miles away. The other option is a train from the airport, which is fast, but it's a 10 minute walk from the train station to the hotel. This is ok if you don't have a lot of luggage, but would be annoying with a lot of bags. The train is Eur 3. Many travel sites have this hotel on special, and I was able to book a US69 rate.
