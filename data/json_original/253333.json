I felt sick, What did I do to deserve the insult? Such services scare me, If you staff can not be professional on the phone when people call or when guests call then do away with that option. The profanity \"Your stupid,'' was used by Leisure Country Inn 3350 West Hwy 76, Branson, MO 65616 staff, thats why its included in this review, I wonder who has the audacity to hurl insults over the phone at people he does not know, while working for an establishment like a hotel?", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "branson", "Title": "\u201cA much needed extended stay motel and negotiable.\u201d", "Author": "curus005", "ReviewID": "UR109116989", "Content": "A nice place to stay with all expenses paid such as: wifi tv,radio,heat,ac,hot water, small refrig, furniture, carpeting, drapes,lights like a residents atmosphere with large rooms, W/D, swimming pool and hot tub,and up dated with Spring cleanings, and initial towels and such.

The staff was again........ EXCELLENT and VERY helpful with answers !!! The HOUSEKEEPING Staff was again INCREDIBLE and our in room items REMAINED SAFE !! While there this year WE toured the City of Branson \"FESTIVAL of LIGHTS\" -- that was pretty cool !! The REAL KICKER though was the Shepard of the Hills \"TRAIL of LITES\" --WOW what a ride and what a DISPLAY !! (if your there for the Holidays DO SEE THIS !). We also had a GR8 Wireless connection !! In response to an earlier REVIEW about the shampoo ---- in all our years - there never has been any shampoo at this gr8 INN !! In fact WE always take our own when traveling because we stay at the UNbranded type places and MOST of them have NO SHAMPOO !! But the Leisure Country INN is where we have stayed for the past 15 years and we keep going back because it's AFFORDABLE ,QUIET ,CLEAN ,COZY and we feel RIGHT AT HOME THERE !! So visit CARL and his staff of plenty when in Branson ---- this motel is a place where 3 shows a day can offer a bit of peacefulness and relaxation and it's located right close to HWY 76 with easy access to and from anywhere in Branson !

We paid $80/night, so I figured it would be pretty nice. (Considering most lodging in Branson is fairly cheap.) It was OK, just very basic. There was no fridge or microwave which I was really hoping for because of the babies milk. There was no shampoo; just one bar of soap for a family of four. They do have ice and vending machines on every floor which is really convenient, the couple who checked us in was extremely nice, and the motel was super quiet. I have noticed on some previous reviews where the price per night wasn't so expensive.

Because we waited until the last minute to go, the major chains were booked. We also decided we wanted to save money on the room, and spend it on shopping and entertainment. Stayed 2 nights, cost was about $135 with tax. Rooms were clean, but dated in decor. No shampoo, etc available. But there was a bar of soap. Good water pressure in shower, but I did see a spider on the bathroom floor. Beds were comfortable. The hot tub I wouldn't use because it was the free standing type you would have in your back yard, with a removable cover. The weather was too cool to use the pool. Breakfast was just ok, basic cereal and donuts, biscuits and gravy. No tea bags or hot water. Breakfast was only served for one hour, from 8-9, so less than convenient. The location is good, and walking to the top of the hill and along the strip was really easy, and not an issue. I have stayed at another local motel, and it had a much steeper incline. Basically, you get what you pay for.

It was the best we've had during our five stays in Branson so far. There was a very helpful woman (Joan) that ordered tickets for all of our shows. They were ready at the desk when we checked in. We\u2019ll definitely stay there again. One of our shows (Yakov Smirnoff) was rescheduled from Sunday afternoon to Tuesday morning because he was receiving a Masters Degree from the University of Pennsylvania. That turned out to be a blessing in disguise. My mom and her friends LOVE their Milwaukee Brewers. After the rescheduling of our show, Joan called several sports bars and finally found one that could get the Brewers game. We spent Sunday afternoon there and had a great time. In response to the person who objected to the hills around the hotel, I have to say that Branson is in the Ozark Mountains and hills are a part of the deal there. The only things that I've seen there that have level walking are the insides of buildings. If you are physically challenged by slopes or hills, you need to take a tour bus or drive from place to place and have somebody drop you off at the door if you are unable to negotiate the steep grades in the parking lots.", "Date": "May 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Andover, KS", "Title": "\u201cBest Deal in Branson\u201d", "Author": "Herk", "ReviewID": "UR4406120", "Content": "This is the best deal in Branson.

It has a very \"class act\" atmosphere and I have recommended it to all of my friends. The hotel's new owners are dedicated to providing exceptional service for their customers.

They did NOT tell us the hotel was at the bottom of a very steep hill even though I told them up front I had physical problems and was disabled. We found it was not within walking distance, basically because of the very steep hill one had to climb to get to the main street. Also while there, we were interrupted in our room when the door suddenly opened and a clerk from the hotel was showing rooms, our room, which was occupied.
