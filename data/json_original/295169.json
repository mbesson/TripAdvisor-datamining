The hotel is comfortable. T he rooms are quite small but clean. Lobby was a bit small but had very comfortable sofas. Breakfast was ok and the variety of the stuff served was limited. The lights in the corridors went on and off automatically and unless you huried you would have to walk In the dark. People at reception are not friendly but will help you. There was no complimentary fruit on the arrival day as was mentioned in the website. The location is superb. There was free internet connection with high speed.

Very busy with a lot of coming and going in the lobby and consequently the lifts took a while to arrive sometimes. We had a room each which was excellent but they were probably a bit small for sharing - not much storage space either. Cleaned daily though, plenty of hot water but never did work out the air conditioning system!!! The Buffet Style Breakfast was plentiful enough, and again always very busy, but I thought pretty limited in choice compared to Golden Age 1. However it did set you up for the day's exploring. We did try lunch once and again it was buffet style and OK. A steak sandwich I ordered at the bar one evening though was pretty hard work and I never repeated that. Found the staff helpful enough once they understood what was required and that could be a bit frustrating but, to be fair, the majority of guests were not English speakers either. View from the room was better than Golden Age 1 but just roof tops and not very picturesque except maybe at sunset? As most people have said can't fault the location but I never did find the swimming pool........", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London UK", "Title": "\u201cBig hotel, top location, noisy rooms.\u201d", "Author": "clownshoes", "ReviewID": "UR123955952", "Content": "A very busy property, this one.

Central, right amongst all the restaurants, nightlife, banks, other hotels, and cafes. Of course this means your only issue is going to be noise. Street noise is a bit of a problem, as my double-glazed window allowed more sound in than expected. The walls and doors are thin, so it was easy to hear the elevator outside, and the young men entertaining themselves in the corridors after a few refreshing after-dinner beverages. The breakfast room is very busy. A large buffet serves Turkish breakfast items - olives, spiced cheese, many salad items, lentil soup. The usual Euro pastries and some cereals are present, along with tea, coffee and juice. A solid breakfast but nothing extraordinary or memorable. The service I received was very good. For example, my room was without towels upon arrival. After a call to housekeeping, the towels were delivered within two minutes. Did I mention free wi-fi?

The street is very safe which makes it a perfect hotel should you wanna explore Taksim night life. As taxi is relatively cheep in Istanbul, you can easily get to any other part.

When I asked reception for the third one as we are three people and occupy triple room, I was told that it's a standard set of two tea cups despite it's two people or three. I was surprised and asked shall we drink tea in order - like two people drink tea and third one waits when when another one finishes to drink, so he can drink the tea from that cup???? The receptionist said - \"yes, that is the only way to do it\", as the third cup won't be given. Next day room service didn't put the bottle of water and it took me five times call to reception asking them to bring the water in the room, which is also included in the room charge.

Our main interest was to visit all the Byzantine and Ottoman monuments with our professor who was the best guide we could ever hope for. We mainly moved around by bus, but the hotel is situated near Taksim square, which you can access easily by metro and cable car. Taksim square seems, also, to be the heart of modern Istanbul, with many young locals and tourists walking up and down the surrounding streets, visiting small boutiques, having lunch or dinner at the numerous restaurants, going for shopping, or just enjoying a late night out at the numerous bars and cafes. The hotel is situated at the borders of a no car zone at the area, so it is very easy for a visitor to walk around, but one should always be very careful when crossing the roads around Taksim square, since there is heavy traffic all day round. The staff was very helpful and they would carry all our luggage from the bus to the hotel's reception hall. Checking in was a smooth and fast procedure and we finally got in our room in very few moments from the time we entered the hotel. Even though there was a mix up and we were allocated a double instead of a twin room, the room was quite nice and comfortable. After speaking with the receptionist we had a new twin room from the next day onwards. The only bad thing was that we had a view towards the inner side of the block, so the view was limited to the people staying at an other hotel, but other people from our group were lucky enough to get rooms with a fantastic city view. That is also the main pro of this hotel, since it is the first one at the top of the hill and there are no other taller buildings obscuring the view from the rooms towards the city. Nevertheless, the room was very comfortable, and clean. The bathroom was quite large, especially the shower was so big that nearly three or four people could fit in there. Breakfast was served at a restaurant on the first floor. Even though relatively smaller than other breakfast areas I have been to at other hotels in Turkey, the atmosphere was lovely, and the food was great. There was a big variety of bread with many different flavours and ingredients, as well as a big variety of cooked choices. Truly, a great way to start your day. I personally didn't use the fitness centre, but some friends of mine did, and from how they have described it to me, I would rate it as an average one. Certainly the swimming pool was more like a children's swimming pool. It was so small that I did't even thought of using it, but it was suitably located at the basement of the hotel, so I think that it would be nice for someone to go straight from the fitness centre to the swimming pool for a relaxing short swim. Overall, we didn't go to Istanbul to stay in the hotel for five days. It was greatly located for us, since we were using a bus every day, but it could be a challenge walking all the way up the hill from the old city, especially for someone who wouldn't like to use the metro and the cable car. But generally it was nice and I would certainly recommend it to a group of young people for a short stay in Istanbul.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shiraz, Iran", "Title": "\u201cBad Hotel, Good Location\u201d", "Author": "imanipour", "ReviewID": "UR102314712", "Content": "The location is good, But All other Things is not.

We had done our research before our travel, so we knew where we wanted to go and on what days.

They told us \"take this Bus, Bus # X, and then go to this station, take the Tram from here to here\" very clear directions and helpful info for how to get to where we wanted to go. Breakfast was very varied, light and delicious. We had their breakfast every morning, it was part of our package deal, and we enjoyed it alot. We made friends with the waiters, and they helped out my friend with her Turkish (she made a good effort to learn the Language and got plenty of help, which really helped us on our trip) the waiters were delighted to hear my friend speak the language and gave her lessons each morning. The rooms were very comfortable, more or less spacious, and with a very clean, modern bathroom. We did not like the safety deposit box so we did not use it. and the Closet was small with one sliding door so you couldn't close both sides at the same time. But I found the space comfortable and we had nice evenings sitting on the round table and chatting. We checked out the Spa and Pool but didn't use it.
