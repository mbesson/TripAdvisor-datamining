{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great hotel for the Aesthetically Oriented The Pure is one of the ultra-chic hotels where everything is perfectly designed down to the smallest detail. In keeping with the name, the theme of the hotel is white: white chairs, white walls, white beds, and a white bar next to the reception counter.The hotel is a short walk from the main train station\u9225\u6501bout two block from the lower level Poststrasse exit. The staff was congenial and professional.The room was very comfortable, and the bathroom was also very nice, although, like some other ultra-modern hotels, the shower took a couple minutes to figure out. The Internet had a wireless connection, which was included with the room. Instead of an old CRT TV, like those one finds all too often found in even the nicest hotels, the room had an LG LCD TV.Unfortunately, I had to leave for the airport too early to enjoy a breakfast, so I can't really comment on this one, but given the attention to detail that the hotel has shown in every other aspect, I suspect that the breakfast would have been good.It's a little expensive for business trip purposes, where the room is mainly a place you go to sleep, but it would be an excellent choice for a vacation or a romantic getaway.", "Date": "Dec 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR348427946", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "popvoid"}, {"Content": "Would look elsewhere After reading the reviews I was really expecting something nice and fun.

Decent work out machines in the (small) downstairs and also an excellent sauna and shower facility - though why no changing room!

This area does double duty as the breakfast dining room offering a good variety of fresh pastries, blended fruit juices and cold meats. There's even a complementary bottle of vodka and shot glasses in the buffet!The rooms are compact, well decorated and very clean with high ceilings. The bathrooms are ample with large showers / baths and nice fluffy towels. Had a room on the third floor street side, but the street is very quiet and noise was not an issue. Some of the rooms are slightly larger than others so be sure to ask when you check-in.

I'm writing this from my (fairly noisy) room in The Pure and my first piece of advice is don't let them put you in room 100. It's on the ground floor right next to the reception/bar area and although it's not throbbing with music you can hear people talking outside which isn't very relaxing. Things didn't go very well on arrival when the receptionist told me I had a single room despite the fact I was holding my confirmation clearly showing I had a double. She apologised and said there was one double left but didn't mention it was right next door to the bar. Apparently I can't change as there are no over rooms available.When I got into the room someone else's suitcase was in there which was removed but without explanation. Later, someone tried my doorhandle but thankfully didn't get in. Again, no explanation.The room itself is pleasant if a little sterile but it's very clean with a large bathroom and the free wifi is a plus. There's no restaurant at the hotel which wouldn't be a problem if it were possible to get some light snacks in the bar, but they don't offer any.Overall, I would say my experience so far has been disappointing.

Free internet access using their laptops was also a nice plus.

This hotel had just opened and I think we may have been the first people to ever stay in the room. It was a little more modern than I'm accustomed to, but all the facilities were great. Do take care with the shower curtain, it doesn't come quite the whole way down and it is easy to spray water all over the bathroom, as my wife found out.
