{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Strange Showers I liked the hotel; it was clean although the rooms were a bit small. We stayed here because it looked nice and was not as expensive as some of the others.The shower was just odd. It was just a glass front facing into the room so you could see in full view who was in the shower....not very comfortable if you're staying with friends!The room also backed onto a building in ruins, which was not very pleasant to look at.The hotel is quite a distance away from the old centre so it's a fair walk through a small park and the business centre.Overall not bad but quirky.", "Date": "Apr 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR811475004", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "rebeljenn"}, {"Content": "Lovely hotel The hotel is very nice. The space in the room is above the average in this category. The breakfast is really good and the staff is very helpful.

The hotel is new with a trendy feel and excellent rooms following the new fashion of putting the bathrooms into the bedrooms without dividing walls. Exhibition times are alwyas a problem for Frankfurt Hotels as they are booked out. Although they should be prepared for it, the Flemings Hotel was not, especially in the dining room where staff needed much more training. They were getting orders wrong or forgetting meals altogether. I hope these are just teething problems. I hope so as I'm back there in August. The food was good although the menu was a bit limited. The bar was busy and had atmosphere. During exhibitions a shuttle bus is laid on for the 10 minute journey. If you are a tourist wanting to be in the centre of Frankfurt this Hotel is not for you. Although only a short taxi ride its in a residential area which is quiet. For the Messe though its a great new addition to the Hotel scene.", "Date": "Mar 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR458154108", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "tomtom333"}, {"Content": "Sehr empfehlenswert immer wieder   showReview(13201665, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR412048546", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Perfekt   showReview(11316065, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR297793682", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "W\u7709rde wieder dort \u7709bernachten   showReview(11668456, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR264160539", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Stylish und chic, aber laute Geb\u76f2udeteile   showReview(8492027, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR555382972", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "HHChris"}, {"Content": "Super Hotel   showReview(11392737, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR976564903", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d601523-r14732718-Fleming_s_Hotel_Frankfurt_Neue_Borse-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "601523", "Price": "$205"}}
