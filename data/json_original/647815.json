I checked in and avised that I would be staying for at least a month but would be paying daily. Keep in mind, With a $50 deposit, my second day i was not even $20 dollars short and said i would be paying the remainder in an hour. Mr. Brown dude Kyler at the front desk who can BARELY speak english, asked me to leave. And not even politely, i might add. Going on and on that i was apparently asking for the world in my palms! During my stay, couldnt sleep as the sound of the Gardiner Expressway (busy hwy) kept me up. Internet connection is patchy Wasnt the only one occupying my room; met mr roach in the bathroom Extremely cheap soap and towels smelled of bleach and were to tough for my skin And the pics of the room on their website are deceiving. They show the renovated rooms on their site but put me in the crap room! Old furniture. TV from 1912. Old linens. Carpet and broadloom smelled like bodily fluids! Wouldnt be surprised if i caught a disease Mr Kyler needs to return to school and learn the hospitality industry from square one as I believe was away they taught customer service.

The hotel is on the West end of the city near a mall and a couple major freeways. There's not really much you can walk to as far as restaurants or entertainment. At the same time, it didn't really seem like a bad neighborhood or anything. My room was in the second building and backed up to Evans Ave and the traffic was a little loud, but I would imagine rooms off the street would be a bit quieter. The room was clean - nothing stuck out as nasty or grimey. The decor and carpet are all a bit dated and worn, and there was no soap or coffee maker in the room. The towels and linens are not the finest quality. But all that said - for the price (under $100) I was quite satisfied with a clean, safe room within the city. One funny thing - the shower had 2 shower heads! One was the standard wall mount, then there was one of the big, rain spout types from the ceiling. It was like a strage little luxury in an otherwise average room!

This place is not for you if you are a large person, struggling with your weight, are a family planning to spend a lot of time in your room or a person without a car. The free parking was great but for a person dependent on transit I think there would be better locations. It was walking distance to a major shopping mall.

It's not and there is nothing within walking distance. There is a brand new American style Mall and some strip mall shopping with McD's and Walmart and some other various mega chain food outlets.

After reading the reviews here and hearing good things from family about some Americas Best Value Inn, I booked 2 nights. We arrived in Toronto after being on the road for 14 hours. When I pulled in the parking lot I was a little concerned. Just didn't look like a great side of town. I got out of the car and noticed the bullet proof glass at the check in area. In my mind I am still remembering all the good reviews I had read. Trying not to judge a book by its cover. When we got to the room I had to put all of my weight against the door to open it. The room was a good size. It smelled pretty musty. Sat down on the bed and almost went to the floor. NO SUPPORT. My husband laid down on the other side and rolled right into me. The toilet seat had to be held up while going to the bathroom. The AC unit was nasty. When I went to turn the knob it came off in my hand. Couldn't figure out why it was not working, then my husband noticed it was not plugged in. I called the front desk to inquire about the free wireless internet. I immediately began looking for another hotel. When I found some other \"deals\" on the net. I went to the front desk to ask for a refund. I don't know where to start. The clerk at the front desk said we had been in there for an hour, she can't refund my money. She went on to ask if the room had been \"USED\". UMMMM did we.....?? Nope had spent the hour looking for another room. I was willing to try another room in the hotel, but the clerks attitiude just got worse and worse. She wanted to inspect the room before she would give us a refund. When she followed us to the room and the bed was not in disarray, she continued with the attitiude. When we explained that we were tired and a good bed was one of the top priorities, she asked if the bed was the only problem. Horrible customer service, not great location.
