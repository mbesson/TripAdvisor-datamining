It's surrounded by scaffolding and on a one-way street; my taxi driver had to call his dispatcher to get directions. But it's one block from a jogging path along the river, which I appreciated. Everything was very clean. I was upgraded to a one-bedroom corner suite with full kitchen. Since it's a older building the rooms were sizable and there were lovely tall windows and I believe 10- or 11-foot ceilings.Unusually sunny for a hotel room. I could hear the elevator and street noise, but that's true of many hotels and the bedroom was buffered from the hallway by the kitchen and bathroom. The living room had a two-seater leather couch and club chair, which I don't find comfortable against skin, a desk with shelving, books and magazines, and a wall-mounted HDTV. There were a moderate number of channels, a couple of which dropped in and out. The room could have used reading lamps by the couch and chair, and if the couch were longer it would have been more comfortable for stretching out. The free Wifi was reliable on a weekend but dropped in and out on weekdays. But I appreciated the size and tall ceilings and windows. There is a hall closet and the room was large enough to have guests or clients (although limited seating). Phone was in this room. I agree with others that the platform bed with thin mattress should be replaced, but I don't mind somewhat firm mattresses and it didn't prevent me sleeping. Plenty of pillows and an extra blanket. Neither of the bedside reading lamps worked (unless I failed to figure out the switches) and it was late so I didn't bother to ask for help. But there was a sizable bedroom closet with organizers (shelves, drawers) tucked inside it. There was a wall-mounted TV in the bedroom but no second phone. No bedside tables (no room). Ironing board, iron and full-length mirror. Nice bathroom with shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, sewing kit, shoe shine cloth and shower cap. Plenty of towels and soap. Sufficient shower pressure; toilet handle had to be held down to flush. Fancy glass bowl sink but not much space to lay down your things -- but there are shelves over the toilet. They served a complementary full breakfast in the bar, beginning at 7am. Scrambled (powder) eggs, meats, toast and other breads/pastries, yogurt, fruit, juice and coffee and tea. A great timesaver and hot food is always appreciated. The staff was very friendly and responsive, dealing immediately with a battery change in the TV remote and offering to bring ice. They patiently answered all my questions and directed me to a nearby 24/7 Duane Reade and deli. I got all wake-up calls on time and housekeeping didn't disturb. I would stay here again.

The perfect location to see NYC. Very quiet at the weekend. Open top tour bus is the best way to travel because of value for money. City Sights NY was perfect. There is a bus stop a stone's throw from the hotel and the tube is one street up. The hotel breakfast didn't look great so we just ate out around. This wasn't a problem though as there are tons of yummy diners and cafes nearby. A&F is only down the road and tons of lovely restaurants too in a cobled street waterside area. Feels very european and classy (a nice contract from the brashness of time square). The breakfast was the only disappointing thing about the hotel and we didn't eat it (may have been better than it looked). I would recommend going room only though. The prices are incredible, given the size of the room and quality of the hotel. Very stylish and boutique feel. We were upgraded. It was my friends 30th. We stayed in room 805. Surely the best room in the hotel. As big as my sitting room and lounge put together!! I though NYC rooms were sposed to be small?!!!!?? Two massive double beds, a leather couch, a desk area. Bathroom didn't really match up with the 5 star standard of the room but it was pleasant and clean and well appointed. Staff were friendly but left you to be independant. Perfect! Free internet and computer = a definate plus. We booked through Late rooms and paid 100-150 pounds a night. 50-70 each. What a bargain!!! I would definately go back to Eurostars when in NYC. I don't even think the big hotels (where you pay 4 times as much) would come close to comparing in value for money, location and style. Book this now or you'll regret it. Prices are jumping up week after week.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Eurostars Wall Street", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1164645-Reviews-Eurostars_Wall_Street-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "$210 - $447*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">129 Front St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">10005</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1164645", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3a/e2/3ae2f8b3705ee99c0fbc8801edd193f91large.jpg"}}
