The deck was awesome - about the size of the room. However, we tried to shower 3X here and had cold showers 2 of 3 times. Not only that, but we got the jacuzzi room - and had warm water only 1 of 4 times we tried to use it!! We tried to run the jacuzzi at 10 PM - no warm water. We tried to run it again the next morning - again, no warm water. We must have hit the jackpot running it when we first arrived. We're not sure why you'd put a jacuzzi tub in if you have problems supplying warm water. So, forget any romantic showering or jacuzzi together. Not what I was looking for, and I wouldn't stay again - unless I don't plan to shower. To note, I was raised in a rural area with limited hot water and plumbing, and we had better facilitiies than this - and we only had 4 people in the household, not 4+ rooms.", "Date": "Nov 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR335884178", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "auramat"}, {"Content": "Beautiful location, wonderful suite! My husband and I stayed at the LemonTree for 5 nights in September. The property has a charming courtyard. Our 1BR suite was upstairs with a wonderful balcony overlooking the ocean. I loved the decor of the rooms - unusual lighting, cool furniture, flat screen TV's. There were full kitchens in the suites(no ovens, though), and you can also use the grill outside. The LemonTree is literally right on the ocean - every morning we went for long walks down the stretch of beach there(all beaches in PR are public). We ate all our meals on the balcony, which was furnished with table and chairs, as well as deck chairs. Overall it was a wonderful vacation, and we would definitely return.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR292584310", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "onourwayhome"}, {"Content": "Marvelous This place is amazing, magical -- a true gift, and exactly what I needed. I came with my girlfriend to escape the hustle and bustle of NYC, to just relax and recharge and have a good time. The Lemontree was just what we needed, enchanting! The spectacular view from the deck, and the blue sea so expansive, and ocean sunsets painting the sky pinks and reds and oranges for evening meditation. We even saw a rainbow across the bay over Mayaguez! The Lemontree is on the beach -- couldn't ask for more! We swam every day and just got back in tune with our lives. The grounds are beautiful, set with flowers and plants in just that perfect ratio that gives the tropical paradise feel. Long walks on the beach gave us a feeling of perfect freedom, but also wonderful community. Fully equipped kitchens were a big plus, since we could stay in bed and have breakfast right in our room. The Lemontree provides yukatas -- Japanese summer robes -- a really unique addition (and very fun!) The help and management are delightful and charming, true hosts to this fascinating, authentic, tropical world.The Lemontree is now our one-stop ticket to the ideal vacation, it will be yours.", "Date": "Oct 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR135243632", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "WorldCitizen2828"}, {"Content": "Loved it! I enjoyed my stay at the lemontree.The rooms are clean, spacious and well equipped.It was great to rent snorkel gear right there at the 'tree.The beach has soft sand and gentle waves but it is very thin at high tide. I liked that, high tide brought the surf sound closer. The veranda is great for catching some rays while watching Rays skim by. You watch the sun rise  set.The staff was welcoming and helpful. The T.P. issue appeared to be the normal routine on PR.We had plenty of hot water.I'm glad that lemontree prides itself on being a 'green' hotel.Although, I did wish that there a more active recycling program in town  at the hotel.One drawback that I'd not read of in my research is the burning season. Some days there were several brush/trash fires and we had to close our apartment and use the A.C. rather than the sea breezes. I would recomend this hotel.", "Date": "Feb 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR433015574", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SDaydream"}, {"Content": "Cute, but not the the best place to stay in Rincon We stayed in the Pina suite. It was very cute and comfortable. We loved the deck over the ocean. Overall we had a great time here. There were a few problems though. We weren't able to put toilet paper in the toilet because of plumbing issues, which are pretty common in Peurto Rico. There was no water pressure. The hot water in the shower did not work the first night. They had it fixed the next day. The water still wasn't working properly it would get really hot than turn ice cold. The temperature kept changing, making it hard to enjoy your shower. We feel that we should have been told about this prior to booking. For $170 a night you would expect to have hot showers. There wasn't a beach, you walk down the stairs into the ocean. It's a nice quiet and private area to swim, but no beach to hang out on. I think Tres Sirenas would be a better choice to stay. They have a great beach. All in all it was a romantic and relaxing stay.", "Date": "Aug 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR276961890", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "offthebeatentrack"}, {"Content": "GREAT PLACE TO STAY!!! We had a fantastic stay at the Lemon Tree. The room was perfect with amazing views. Very romantic. Rooms are completely renovated.

Loved it! The LemonTree was a wonderful. It provided a truly Puerto Rican beach-house experience. The Tree (as it is known around the isla) was perfect for my fiance and I. The beach, directly outside of my cottage, meant we could easily spend hours lounging on the freely provided beach chairs. The Tree also has a terrific little garden situated all along the walls and inner courtyard. As we were there for the holidays, Bella and Ted (the owners) set up fabulous festive holiday lights which really added to the ambience. Best of all about the Tree though, were it's decks. My cottage was equipped with a very big deck overlooking the sea. At night time, I felt as if I were on a cruise ship and was sailing away.Anyways, my only complaint would be that there were not enough wine and cheese get-togethers hosted! This is a great feature about the Tree: weekly wine and cheese with free massages from a hired professional. Definetly worthwhile!The Tree was a great experience and I am already planning my next trip.

We saw the property - it was average. Clean, but nothing extraordinary - but the recommendation by them to do a snorkeling charter with Taino Divers was a really BAD IDEA!

True to these reviews, we were right to prepare ourselves for more of a cottagelike feel then a hotel. The rooms and kitchens are getting worn and need some work, and we started losing water pressure toward the end of our 4 night stay. But ultimately it was great to sit out on the large porches, drinking rum concoctions, watching the pelicans dive for fish, the sunrises and sunsets, and the twinkling lights of Mayquez in the distance, all as the ocean waves crashed beneath our feet. At day, it's a short drive to the lightly populated beach of our choice; and at night, it's a short drive to the reasonably priced dinner location of our choice.In response to some of the service complaints, we had no problems. Also, there are new owners, who we saw everyday. So it will be interesting to see what becomes of the LemonTree over the next year or so.", "Date": "Jan 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR677882018", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "DCJP"}, {"Content": "No toilet paper in the bowl. We stayed 2 nights at the Lemontree in early December 2004. Upon arrival we were told not to put any toilet paper in the bowl and to take a brief Puerto Rican shower. We learned this news upon arrival and had already been charged for our 2 nights stay. I feel we should have been told this when we made our reservation or given the option upon arrival to cancel our stay. We vacationed in Puerto Rico for 10 days, stayed at 5 places and were looking forward to staying at the Lemontree because of good reviews from two sources. This was the only place we stayed at that had this requirement. The water pressure was fine and the toilet flushed better than our other lodging places. I just feel the owners should have been upfront with us about the water problems and allowed us to find other lodging. After all we were on vacation and not at a busy time.

We had an absolutely wonderful time there. A very private stay which we enjoyed immensly. Very simple accomodations, but perfect for what we were looking for. We stayed in one of the top rooms  the view was breathtaking, with a perfect sunrise  perfect sunset each day from the deck. We saw a whale as we had breakfast on the deck  many sea pelicans. Owners could not have been more pleasant  accomodating. The only noise was the crashing of the ocean under our deck. We enjoyed grilling on the deck each night  looked for a local lunch as we explored the area each day. The local people were very friendly. (make sure that you go watch the surfers from the deck of a great bar near town)  We wished that our stay of 4 nights could have been longer. We moved from there to an expensive beach resort, but as it was on the water, it was far from the water. (business trip)  did not enjoy it nearly as much. We loved that the deck actually hung out over the water at the Lemon Tree. This is like renting a beach house not a fancy resort.
