Coffee was outstanding, as well as the Orange Juice freshly made. Location: Be very carefull when you look for a room in Venice.

We had booked a New Year getaway at the last minute when all the central hotels were charging the earth for a room. We were very pleasantly surprised by the prices on offer from the Vecellio for this popular, busy time of year and decided to book as the location, right next to the Alilaguna stop at Fondamente Nove, was also perfect for us - no lugging suitcases over bridges! We like to stay in this Cannaregio area as it provides shelter from the crowds in the more touristy areas while at the same time only being a short walk from these places. The owner gave us a warm welcome without being overbearing, which was nice after an early start and long journey. He showed us to our room on the ground floor with a great view of the lagoon and San Michele. Unlike a few other reviewers have mentioned, we were not disturbed by the noise from the boats outside but we did visit in winter so had the windows shut most of the time. If you are a light sleeper though, I would suggest requesting a room on one of the upper floors as we could hear a lot of heavy footsteps coming from the room above ours, and also when people were using the main staircase which was next to our door. The room and bathroom were fairly small in size, as you would expect from a converted Venetian house, but manageable and had a lot of nice traditional Venitian features - the headboard, mirror, light fittings and soft furnishings. We found our room to be clean and the maid did an excellent job of sprucing it up each day for us. There were a few small issues that we had with the room but nothing we felt we needed to complain about due to the price we had paid, the short nature of our visit and the central location of the hotel. The TV in the room was small and very high up above the bed so hard to see. The volume also didn't work but we weren't in Venice to watch TV in our hotel room, we were there to absorb and enjoy the atmosphere of the city. If you do want to have the option of watching TV in your hotel room, please note that this hotel only has Italian channels. The wardrobe door in our room was coming away at the hinges which meant that it kept swinging open. The owner mentioned that he would fix it for us on arrival but didn't manage to during our stay so we wedged it shut with one of our suitcases. Also, one of the lights at the side of the bed wasn't working as the bulb needed changing, we only had one pillow each and no spares in the wardrobe, and the minibar was empty. The owner was so helpful I'm sure he would have helped us with these things but as I said, these are trivial problems and it was such a short stay on a budget spending so little time in the room, we didn't feel the need to kick up a fuss. The only other issue we had was that the maid left our window open while we were out one day - a bit worrying as we were on the ground floor. Luckily we popped back mid-afternoon for warmer clothing so were able to shut it before the room got too cold and we had most of our valuables with us while we were out and about. Do make sure if you are leaving anything valuable in the room when you go out to make use of the safe - I believe it is free of charge despite a 10E label on the door. Just ask at the desk. There are a couple of fun places very nearby: Algiubagio the restaurant is really excellent. We shared a large starter, had two mains, shared a dessert, a bottle of prosecco and two limoncellos for 110\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. Considering the quality of the food, surroundings and service we considered this to be very reasonable for a holiday treat. There is also a friendly little pub called the Tartuga a little further up from Algiubagio that will serve you a lovely pre-dinner Spritz for just 3\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. We were able to store our cases at the hotel after check out which was very helpful. The only other things maybe worth mentioning are that you must leave you key at reception whenever you go out, collecting it again on your return, and you will also see signs in the hotel reception and your room about tourist tax which you pay on checkout. What the signs don't tell you is how much this is. If you are a keen budgeter, the current cost for the Vecellio is 3\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per person per night for the first five nights of your stay. There is no charge after that. I imagine these rates are subject to change and I think you are able to try and claim it back when you get home but we were happy to pay a bit towards to maintenance and development of the city at that price. It didn't break the bank. All in all a good option if you want to be close to Rialto, San Marco, the Arsenale, Murano etc. and are on a budget. You will receive a friendly welcome and enjoy a suitable place to rest your weary head after all the walking about and enjoyment of the wonderful Italian hospitality!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Exeter, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat value great location!\u201d", "Author": "Antras", "ReviewID": "UR121726088", "Content": "This hotel is perfectly located within walking distance of the Rialto and San Marco but away from the busiest areas.

Our room was #5 on the second floor (the one with the gold bed) with a view of the alley.

It's not too far to walk to Ca' d'Oro either. * pretty location - nice for strolls on the lagoon * room size - good enough for us (in our late 20s) * room look - I thought it looked classy. * breakfast - Matteo's coffee was good, and I appreciated that he had yogurt there and not just pastries. * staff - Matteo was great. One of the other workers (can't remember his name), introduced us to limoncello one of the nights and Matteo said it was on the house when we were checking out. Dislikes: * air conditioning - not particularly effective, and it condensed and dripped on the floor * noise - I can't imagine it'd be much better anywhere in Venice, but often crowds of people milling around the lagoon area would get loud late at night. Aside: When we were leaving, we got to the train station and thought we forgot our passports in the hotel room. My husband went back for them, but I found them after he was on the way. Luckily, I had the wireless internet hub and was able to e-mail Matteo (I had various phone problems throughout the trip, but e-mail worked), and he told my husband as soon as he got there so he didn't waste any time tearing up the room looking for them.

We usually stay at the excellent Ca Formenta Hotel in Arsenale, but as we were only going to be in Venice for a few hours, we couldn't justify the high price tag of Ca Formenta, so instead we settled for this hotel as it was convenient to get to from the airport, and cost 88 Euros for the night, which is cheap for Venice. When we arrived late in the afternoon, we were greeted by Matteo, the hotel manager, who was laid back and friendly. We had booked the room 3 months in advance and had requested twin beds but Matteo told us that there were none, so we just had to do with a double. We later found out that our double bed was in fact two singles put together, so he could have really made an effort to sort two twin beds for us.Are there no twin rooms in the hotel? Anyway, he took us to our room upstairs (there is no lift so you have to carry your luggage up the stairs) to room 4. The room was small, dark and old. It had a broken window handle and broken electricity outlet with wires hanging out. The bathroom was tiny with an ancient rusty soapbox that had been replaced with a newer one on top to cover it. The shower cubicle was cramped with mould on the floor edges and the shower tap was broken with tape holding it together (see pic). Everything was old and in need of repairing/replacing. The air conditioning was rubbish too as it was very weak and produced no cold air and water was leaking from it. It was getting unbearably hot in the room due to the restricted windows and ancient air con, so I went back down to reception to see if anything could be done about it. At reception, there was now a very old gentleman who said he was there for the night, and Matteo would be back at 8am. When I explained to him about the air con he tried to fob me off by saying that it will work after 10 minutes. I said to him \"I've already been here two hours and it's not working\" so eventually he came to our room to have a look but did nothing as he didn't know how to do anything. I wonder just how long the air conditioning has been like this. The minibar was empty. If you wanted to use the room safe it was 10 Euros. The television set was tiny and was placed so high up you had to be a giraffe to view it, not that it mattered because although it had around 100 channels they were all Italian and there were no English channels like BBC or Sky News or CNN. The bed was actually quite comfy and probably the best thing about the room. The views of the lagoon were decent also, but we had paid extra for this. We went out in the evening to have dinner and didn't like having to leave the room key at reception. We were kept awake for much of the night as we had to keep the windows open to let some air in but there was a lot of noise coming from the restaurants outside and the night vaporetto. Breakfast was served in a tiny space with four tables next to reception and consisted of p!$$-poor pre packed tiny breadrolls and toast crackers, brought to our table in a basket by the manager, along with a little butter and a freshly made cup of coffee. There was a table with yogurts, jam, long life orange juice, and cheese triangles. I had to ask the manager for glasses for the orange juice. There was no real cheese, ham or salami. In fact, nothing on the breakfast table was real! So, to summarise, this is a 3* budget hotel worthy of a 2* rating. No way does this resemble a 3* hotel and therefore my rating reflects this.

What you would expect for the price/area that they were in. I booked the Hotel Vecellio based on other reviews that said the owner, Matteo, was a godsend. He did NOT disappoint! We were shocked and awed by the beauty and cleanliness of our room at the Hotel Vecellio. It was leaps and bounds above where we stayed in Rome and Florence and for about the same price. The bed was comfortable and the room very clean. The location was okay since the water taxi was right outside the door. It got a little loud late and night and early in the morning. But other than that...it was fine. The breakfast was great and truly the hospitality was stupendous. When we explained to Matteo, who speaks nearly perfect english, that it was my birthday he immediately called his \"friend\" at this very chic restaurant and made sure they treated us in a grand fashion! He explained the intracacies of the Venetian \"road\" system to us and gave us great tips on how best to move about the city.

The location of Hotel Vecellio is right on the waterfront at Canareggio outside the Fondamente Nuova ferry terminal which makes finding the Hotel on your arrival so easy. And you don't need to carry your luggage up and down stairs, over bridges and over cobblestones. Believe me, this is a true blessing when travelling in Europe! Once you become familiar with the streets it is less than a 10 minute walk to St Marks Square and Rialto Bridge. However getting lost is part of the deal in Venice. If in doubt or if you get lost it is easy to hop on a ferry back to the Hotel! There are restaurants outside of the Hotel and a supermarket nearby. The other plus is that this part of Venice is less touristy so we were able to observe a slice of typical Venetian life. Otherwise whilst we found Venice to be incredibly beautiful and fascinating, it was overcrowded with tourists and felt like a theme park populated with nothing much than souvenir shops and pizza joints. A tragedy! The included breakfast is very simple and if not for Matteo's coffee I would give it a miss. The food is all prepackaged and even the bread rolls are rubbery. Go out and grab a brioche!

Bathroom was tiny (again, not unusual for Venice) with no extras like soap even (they gave you little shampoo packets that they seemed to think passed as soap, but. they were not useful). Breakfast was the lightest we had at any of our five hotels in Italy- basic coffee, juice, yogurt, bread (no fruit, meats, cheeses, hard bolied eggs, etc). As far as service... We seemed to always have one of two older gentlemen running the front desk when we were coming or going. While I'm sure they were nice people, one did not speak a word of English, the other very little, so it was extremely difficult / frustrating to try to communicate. We got zero information about Venice from this hotel (even after we asked)- no map, site listing, recommendations, etc. Needless to say, we were a little disappointed as usually a hotel/B&B is a great source of local information.

The orange juice was terrible and the rolls were average. It was not the kind of breakfast one finds in most European hotels. I found it lacking. The manager makes a big deal about restaurant advise and how I should stay away from tourist restaurants. He sent me to a restaurant farilry close by and I was surrounded by fellow Americans!

The hotel was very easy to find and only a short walk from the vaporetto stop, but take my advice - DONT OVERPACK. Pack your suitcases, then take out half. You'll never need it and if you do, they sell stuff in Venice! But make sure to haggle with the street vendors - don't pay their price right off the bat. More on how to do this in Trip Advisor Forums soon! The bathroom shower was a bit small but I am a bit large and there was plenty of hot water, not so the Ca'D'oro which was much more expensive and had no hot water the first night! We would try to stay in this hotel if we go back to Venice but if you try to book it, don't be surprised to find it full.

The rooms are beautifully decorated, the location - right by a boat stop - can't be beaten and Matteo is a little gem! Our room had a lovely view of the lagoon and it was great to look out of the window in the morning to watch all the comings and goings below. The bathroom was a little on the small side but was very clean and nicely decorated - and anyway, you don't spend much time in the bathroom! The room itself was immaculate and lavishly decorated. The air conditioning worked okay, and it was best to keep the windows closed to keep out the mosquitoes! I would suggest buying the 72 hour pass for the boats, as this really is the best way to get around - especially when so many boat stops (for many of the main lines) are right outside your doorstep. If you're planning a trip to Murano or Burano, the boat is just outside the hotel. The boat from the airport stopped a short walk from the hotel - over a bridge (bit of a pain with suitcases!).

This is the perfect little hotel. It seems much more than a 2-star. It is beautifully decorated in traditional Venitian style with Murano glass light fixtures, rich brocade drapery and bedspreads, immaculately clean marble floors, gorgeous water views. Amenities include phone, cable TV with CNN in English, hair dryer, efficient air conditioning, a shower with plenty of hot water. We loved the neighborhood where Hotel Vecellio is located. Besides being convenient to the Alilaguna boat from the airport and the vaporetta from the train station, other islands and points around Venice, we found the quiet, residential feel of the neighborhood to be so much more enchanting than the tourist mob scene around St. Marks, Rialto and the Academia areas. After doing the requisite sites in those areas we couldn't wait to get back to \"our\" neighborhood to watch the kids playing soccar with a little dog in Campo Gesuiti, to enjoy a drink and the afternoon sun at a cafe at Campo Santi Giovanni e Paolo, or just to wander around the picturesque narrow streets and imagine what it would be like to live in such a beautiful and unique city. I agree 100% with the other reviewers. Mateo is the perfect host. He is helpful, informative, and full of humor and fun. He arrives in the mornings with a bag of croissants and rolls still warm from the bakery and serves up a hearty breakfast with orange juice, yogurt, soft cheeses, wonderful little amaretto cookies, and the best cappuccino, all the while telling the guests in the tiny dining room, \"Don't be shy, tell me if you want more\". I highly recommed Hotel Vecellio as the perfect place to enjoy your time in Venice.

Matteo gave us excellent advice on local restaurants that had wonderful food and reasonable prices. The breakfasts included in the hotel price were more than we expected (croissants, rolls, biscottis, cheese, yogurt, juice, and the best Italian coffee). Matteo was friendly, helpful and has a good sense of humor. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The hotel is at a Vaporetto stop and thus very convenient for going to the other islands or for taking the public water transportation.
