It is above average, but I wouldn't say that it was \"very good\". This is a nice property, located conveniently at the junction of Friedrichstrasse and Unter den Linden and within walking distance of most East Berlin attractions. It is pretty outside and inside, especially the cute indicator above the lift that showed which floor the lift was at. I didn't like that the bathroom was way too small - virtually no counter space at all. I also didn't like that the hotel has no parking. There used to be a parking structure across the road but it is now being demolished. We had to park in a basement carpark about 3 blocks away, which is quite far by Berlin standards. This was inconvenient especially as we visited during a cold spell. They should provide free valet parking given the circumstances, OR a shuttle (or horse-drawn carriage) to take you up and down the street.

In the Mitte, The Westin Grand is perfectly located at Friedrichsrasse and Unter den Linden. The buses between Alexanderplatz and the Zoo Station (100 and 200 buses) board at this intersection.

We had a junior suite and had two bathrooms - a half bath and a wonderful full bath with two sinks and with fabulous shower. Hotel is just two blocks from the beautiful Gendarmarkt Square with Cathedrals and Concert hall (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmenmarkt) and bistros and brasseries along its streets. The Brandenburg Gate, German History Museum, Opera, Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, The Kenndey Museum, Humboldt University, Museum Island, Galeries Lafayette, Checkpoint Charlie and the Duetsch Guggenheim Gallery (http://www.deutsche-guggenheim.de/index_en.php) are all within an easy walking distance (under 6 blocks). We really enjoyed the breakfast buffet and service each day. We'd choose among sparkling wines, extensive variety of foods/baked goods and fruit, eggs to order.

Don\u2019 bother queuing at the single vending machine as tickets(2,3 euros) can be bought from the driver . This bus get crowded fast with the numerous luggages of travellers . If you\u2019re not alone , one should buy the tickets while the other enters the bus by the middle or back door to secure seats and luggage emplacement. Exit the bus at \u201cunter den Linder/ friedrichstrasse\u201d stop which is right after the \u201cbrandeburg\u201d stop. Then cross Friedrichstrasse , the building in front of you is the Westin but the entrance is located on another corner that can be accessed by going down Friedrichstrasse for a few meters. When travelling by subway , the closest station is Fransosichestrasse and NOT Friedrischstrasse (as can be expected). HOTEL The lobby is quite spectacular as others have mentioned. The check in was smooth but devoid of warmth. The room was ready and we were upgraded to a garden room despite having booked with hotels.com for 100 euros a night. The room is as comfortable as can be expected from a 5 stars but with no \u2018wow\u201d factor . The hotel is a little old even though furniture and appliance are recent, and wear and tear is showing on the doors mainly (crooked security chain fixation, chipped bottom..) but nothing really significant . I had trouble sleeping but cannot really tell if the bed is to blame for that. There is no tea and coffee facility in the room and no ice in the corridor, unlike the Hilton a few blocks away. The garden view is wonderful as one wakes up in the morning to the sound of birds and the street noises are totally blocked out. The garden itself is huge with plenty of chairs and tables to enjoy a drink, weather permitting. The spa area is quite nice with a powerful jaccuzi , a round swimming pool and a well equipped if small gym (power plate, two treadmill, other cardio training apparatus, free weights , water is available) . The area is noisy especially when shared with children The hotel rents bicycles. Although internet is expensive, there is a single computer dedicated to airline check in (cannot access any other website than you airline company which you select from a menu). We did not have food at the hotel. There is a supermarket INSIDE the Friedrischstrasse subway station which can be found further up on Friedrichstasse (cross Unter den Linden and continue for 3 blocks) If interested in typical German food in a typical German restaurant close to the hotel , try Alt-Berliner Kneipe, 55 Mittlestrasse (off Friedrichstrasse on the left ,next treet after crossing unter den Linden) This hotel is highly recommended , 5 star luxury for a small price", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cSuper convenient and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "CAHoya", "ReviewID": "UR127447654", "Content": "I traveled to Berlin with my husband and 6 other friends to run the Berlin Half Marathon.

However, I think his choice couldn't have been more perfect. The location is excellent - literally blocks from the Brandenburg Gate, the metro, and an easy walk to so many other places. We took a cab from TXL; other friends found the train an easy ride from the other airport. The Westin is also a short cab ride from the main train station. Our room was on the courtyard side of the building, so it was very quiet. As always, the bed was heavenly, and the toiletries were the same as you'd find at any other Westin. The room itself was on the smaller side, but I think that might be normal for Europe.

We have these kind of meetings about 3 times per year at different locations in Europe. We choose the Westin Grand Berlin because of its location in Berlin, the good reviews and because the offer/meeting room met our budget and needs. Once the decision on venue was made, the biggest challenge in the organisational phase was getting information/answers from the sales manager who seemed to be overworked. This is the first meeting where I did not get to meet the sales manager and where there was no follow-up of the sales manager during and after the meeting on how everything was going. Nevertheless, we were in very good hands as all our wishes during the meeting were fulfilled thanks to the wonderful catering staff and especially thanks to Frau Kiki who was very accommodating to all our needs. Thank you very much, Frau Kiki! You made this meeting a success! I would absolutely recommand the Westin Grand Berlin for business meetings and for pleasure. Location is great, within walking distance of the Brandenburger Tor, Checkpoint Charlie, many shops, malls, restaurants and bars. Breakfast can be taken in the hotel or there are plenty of breakfast places in Friedrichstrasse. The hotel lobby is beautiful and impressive. There are plenty of tables and comfy seating to have something to eat or do some work on your computer. The guest room is spacious and clean; the bed is truly heavenly, the bathroom has nice toiletries and the shower is great. No need to bring your own hair dryer as the Westin's one works just great!

Overall, the service, food and attention to detail I found to be on par with best in class hotels. Also, the hotel is very close to many of the main attractions of the city (within walking distance). One important incidence however left a bitter taste in my mouth. Before going to bed one night I requested an early morning wake up call with the appropriate hotel staff. I emphasized that I had to attend a very important business breakfast meeting in the morning, and that they should not forget to wake me up. I was given emphatic assurances that there should not be any problem. Lo and behold, I never received a wake up call from the hotel staff, woke up late and missed my meeting! When I called the hotel staff to ask why I was not awakened, I was told by the person answer. When I pressed to state that the phone could not have rung as it was right to my bed and that I was a light sleeper, she then changed the story to mention that she did try to call me, but that ended up receiving a message that I had already checked out. I found this to be inexcusable. I did have the nagging feeling that something was not right and that something was missing. This person could have easily verified with the front desk if I had indeed checked out! It was really embarrassing to later apologize to my business contacts for not being able to live up to my commitment. I never received any apology or even a call from any of the hotel staff to offer any regrets on this oversight!

Still this is a minor point. The bathroom was also large, clean and the shower had good water pressure. The style of the rooms is not really hip and happening and is the standard/typical 'Corporate' style room, this said it was no big deal for me as everything was clean and worked!!

We could pay a few euros for a coffee in a cafe down the street and get internet for free but we cannot get it in the hotel that we are paying a considerable rate for. Guests are relegated to walking the city in search of a Starbucks instead of taking care of staying connected in the comfort of their hotel. That is quite objectionable in our view and sours the impression a bit of what is a lovely hotel .", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Mitte\u201d", "Author": "Jeffrey M", "ReviewID": "UR121435861", "Content": "We recently completed another trip to our favorite European destination, Berlin.

Many things are walkable. Lots of good restaurants and shopping all along Friedrichstrasse. Our room was very nice, although I'm still scratching my head about the pricing (one of my coworkers paid a hundred Euro less per night for a similar reservation). The one thing to consider carefully is breakfast service. While the hotel has \"deals\" to get breakfast buffet for only 20 Euros a day if you sign up for every day, that's still pretty steep. Their one day price is even worse at 30 Euro. The food wasn't really worth that much, it's sort of typical high end western hotel buffet, but I've actually seen better at other hotels, and for cheaper. I recommend skipping hotel breakfast and visiting one of the many cafes and restaurants within a block or two.

The hotel itself is in a great location within easy walk of the mian shopping and sight seeing areas. The problems started when we arrived. When i booked on their website I stated that we would be arriving at 9:30am......we arrived closer to 10:30am... They did not have the room ready....we were told it would be available around 3 in the afternoon. I found this unacceptable as we both wanted to freshen up beofer heading into the city. The next option was another room(20 euro more expensive) that would be ready at 12...so we bought coffee and sat in the lobby for 90 mins. The room itself was fine...although it was supposed to be overlooking the couryard!!!!! more like overlooking the back of the hotel....but it was one of the more modern rooms in the hotel. Next problem...only one bathrobe and slippers....and the shampoo etc was for one....not a huge problem but I would expect a little more from a 5 star hotel. Also they had a load of free things you could ask for...sewing kit....toothbrush, razor, comb etc....but I would have expected some of that(sewing kit for example) to be in the room...also the list is on the back page of the 'guide' in the room. I left 3 shirts in to be ironed......about 10am...they arrived the next day...which was annoying as I wanted a fresh shirt for dinner that night. In short the room was great and location was fab...just a few little things that make me question the 5 star level....I stayed in le Meridien in Vienna a few years ago(also 5 star) and the level was better.... finally...they had NO free wi-fi....In this day and age I would expect it...and not a bill of 7 euro per hour!!!", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for Christmas Markts\u201d", "Author": "roadwarrior50", "ReviewID": "UR118238897", "Content": "This was a great location and has all the amenities you would expect from a Westin.

We arrived in the afternoon and could visit most of touristic sights in East on that day. Yes, Berlin has quite good transportation system but in fact, we did not need any of it much except the day we decided to go to West part. Room size is quite good, not too big but not small at all. Room deco is ok, nothing special but the bed was sooooo comfortable. We were very happy to sleep on the bed after long walk. I must say the Location and the bed were the best thing of Westin Grand Berlin. I have mixed feeling about the breakfast. The room was very crowded every morning and definitely they need bigger room and more table as we sometimes even had to wait to get a seat. They serve eggs made to order but it's next to impossible to get an omelet in half an hour as there are so many people waiting for their eggs and there was only one person with one pan making it. Other than that, the variety is not big but I thought there was enough food for a breakfast. However, I would not pay 30EUR/p (the price they normally charge) for this breakfast. We had a deal to pay 15EUR/p/n for our 3nights stay and I thought 15EUR was the right price for it. Staff were nice and friendly. Con : The pictures of the hotel website doesn't show what it is exactly. The hotel is much smaller than it looks on the pictures, which I don't mind at all as I am more on boutique hotel lover than a huge chain hotels, and the swimming pool was way smaller than I saw on the website. Hotel deco also was a bit too classic and too Brown for my taste. Drinks are very expensive at the bar. My husband had a couple of glasses of white wine, just basic ones, and they charged 10EUR for a glass and 11.50EUR for another. They serve the drinks with a bit of snack and nuts but if you are allergic to nuts and another one doesn't eat salty snacks, they are nothing but a waste. I thought it would have been nicer if they charge less on drinks and serve these on request at an extra cost. Overall, I enjoyed staying in Westin Grand Berlin but if I go back to Berlin next time, I would stay in modern style hotel with a bit better gym and swimming pool. I would recommend this hotel to first time visitors as the location and the bed will be the most important thing then. Tip : The bottle of water in room is not free of charge.

Dates of stay: 9th june till 12th june 2011 The Exterior: Looks pretty nice for a modern building, nothing trully beautifull, but ok though and it integrates perfectly in the Friedrichstrasse The Area: Fantastic area with tons of shops and interresting tourist must see stuff. At walking distance from the Brandburg, Paris square, Reichstag, Jewish memorial, \u2026 Lots of good restaurants and bars too. In my opinion, the best location possible. The Interior: Very impressive and nicely decorated. A touch of old fashion feature makes it look like an historic hotel palace. The check in: No complains, it was fast and friendly. The room: I could have been upgraded in a much nicer room but as I requested a balcony, to smoke. Our room was very very far away from the main elevators. Room number 177. You have to go to the second floor, then walk till the end of 2 long corridors, take stairs to go back to the first floor and here you are. If they propose a room numbered 16X or 17X, decline, unless you smoke, as these are the only ones with a balcony. The space in the room itself is average, not really small but far from other Starwood hotels space I\u2019ve seen so far. The smallest is this one. The AirConditioning/Heating: Works great, silently, doing what we expected. The Bathroom: A small bathroom but with a nice walk in shower. Amenities are ok but not enough for two people. The space in the bathroom doesn\u2019t allow two peole to be in there at the same moment. The Bed: Great bed though very close to the walls due to the small room. The Breakfast: From 6 am till 10.30 Probably the best buffet I had the chance to check in a Starwood Hotel. Very very nice. The Room Service: Didn\u2019t really used it except for a bottle of wine and it was quick and friendly. The Restaurant(s)/bars: We tested the lobby bar upon arrival where we were offered a glass of champagne and a cury wurst. Top notch. Great food, massive even, and delicious. We also had aperitive on the terrace and the service was absolutely great and professional. Check out: That was a pain as I noticed they charged 4 times the internet for a 3 day stay. I had no time to argue and for the rest the lady was efficient. Guess what : they charged back the fourth day of internet on my credit card ! Congrats guys. Service/Housekeeping: Didn\u2019t notice anything wrong with this. Good overall. I really like: - The location - The friendness of the staff I really dislike: - The very long walk to the room - The internet rate is ok but the system, which is not a Westin one but a third party is very confusing. Be cautious if you use it. We had two computers and were suppose to be able to use both with a single code but could not find a way to do that. My conclusion: It\u2019s a very nice hotel, in a perfect location and I would probably come again\u2026if I stop smoking :-) I\u2019m sure there are much better rooms in this hotel and, if I stop smoking :-) I\u2019ll check their Spa Suite which looks beautifull.

The hotel is clearly a business hotel and I really learnt to appreciate what it offers. I am in Berlin seven to ten times a year and the Westin is always my first choice. Many travelers who underline the great location are absolutely right. The is only one hotel that has a better location in Berlin and that is the Adlon. Another category for sure. The Westin Berlin has different room types. Standard rooms face the street but if you close the windows it is calm. These rooms feature some dark wood elements in some parts of the room still. Its a question of taste. The so called Linden rooms all face \"Unter den Linden\" which allows you to see the Brandenburg gate from your room as well as the TV tower. These are my favorite room types there as they fully follow the Westin style when it comes to colors and fabrics. All the so called theme suites are more or less interesting, Totally not Westin as the are old fashioned in grand hotel style with woods and every suite has its own theme named after composers or lyrics. If you look for something special and classy the Sancoussi Suite is for sure worth the money. I always feel like a prince in there ;-) The SPA suites are not oversized but offer a very modern wellness equipment. Jaccuzzi, movable walls, movable massage rest that also works as a table... quite cool and if you like to spend some time indulging and relaxing without the company of foreigners its a nice option. All these suites face the Bavarian Mission, which I think is a funny detail discovering the bavarian flag when waking up in the morning. The Wellness area is quite nice but noting too special. Average size pool, jacuzzi an a spa salon. If you want to use the Sauna they charge extra unless you are a top tier client. Since they introduced this policy I think it became quieter in the Sauna what is a good thing to me. Two highlights: The lobby is really worth to sit for a pre dinner cocktail, especially when there is a piano player. Some of the waitresses work there for decades and if you ask nicely they can also share stories of the times when this hotel still was a meeting point for GDR representatives. There are two concierges. Both guys can come over as very Berlin-like (in a positive way), while being extremely polite and helpful. Mr. Lindner must be a walking legend in Berlin, as every cab driver, club owner or Chef au Rant I talk to in Belrin seems to know him. The second concierge is Mr Schneider. My absolute favorite concierge in Germany. If you ask for something you can be sure he will find a way. He arranged cupcakes from the other side of the city and developed a way to save the taxi fee for it..Thats just one example. So to sum it up: the Westin is a good choice. You know what you get. It is not a snobby place nor does it pretend to be hip. Its a place where you can relax and get all the support you can expect from this house. Great for families, great for business.

Very central location (even if in Berlin, it is not a key point when choosing an hotel, since the public transportation system is amazing and you will never be more than 100m away from a bus, U-Bahn, S-Bahn, etc. station). Room was clean and equipped with all the expected stuff (LCD-TV, mini-bar, etc.). The hotel was however a bit impersonal and \"faded\". I don't mean that in a bad way but if you want to stay in a fancy place like there are in Berlin (boutique hotel among others), then you should probably book another one! If you like to stay in a Westin Grand, you won't be disappointed. It is like it is in almost all the others (you'll find the same shampoo, the same bed sheet, etc.). Room was quite as well (good isolation). The Spa was nice, the gym a bit tiny for such a big hotel. Besides that, there are in my opinion a couple of bad points: The wi-fi: 19,50\u20ac for 24 hours, this is just a joke! The breakfast: 30\u20ac for an orange juice, a croissant, some toast and a coffee: this is a robbery! The sauna: you get to pay extra-money to have access to the sauna. Common guys, if you book a room in a 5* hotel, you don't expect to have such surprise. I don't know, make the room 5\u20ac more expensive but don't do that. It looks really niggardly!

Also, there are tons of great restaurants within 10 minutes. One of my favorite things about Europe is that many of the cities are so \"walkable\". In this respect, I don't think there is a better spot. The lobby bar, common areas and pool/spa are all top-notch, very much in line with the Westin image in Europe (I wish I could say the same for the US Westins)! The place is a great mix of turn of the century grand and modern/sleek Germany. Whatever it is, they do it well. The only low mark on my visit was the food. Not terrible but only a bit above average. I had coffee and dessert two nights in my room. I don't expect much in the way of portion size, but the desserts where almost bite size (but good quality). The decaf coffee on my second night came in the form of two pouches of instant and a pot of hot water - very poor! I travel a lot for business and pleasure, so don't generally have high expectations for room service, but this was disappointing. Concierge - seemed to be stuck on one restaurant (Dresschler's), which is immediately behind the hotel. They gave me the same recommendation for both nights even though what I asked for was quite different. You can read the review of this place on Trip Advisor.

Incredibly I was offered a choice of two rooms that were ready and one that I could wait for. The person even helped me with my choice, as one queen bed was most important to me, rather than two singles as a king. After helping me with my choice, she apologized for keeping me at the desk for more than a few minutes. Incredible. Every employee I encountered had this same professional can-do attitude. The rooms are moderately sized but very fresh and well laid out. The housekeeping was impeccable every day. By the fourth day I was looking for something out of place and couldn't find it.The bed was comfortable as were the sheets and towels. The building has lots of character. For those who need it to pass the time, the only English TV are the international news stations. There are movies in English on pay TV though. One tip, they have iPad rental for 19.50 Euros per 24 hours. I tried it and it was great. There were maps, and the easy email in your room and unlimited web over the cell phone network was great. If you don't need what's on your laptop, this is probably a better deal then paying for daily internet service unless you need to download anything really big as I did hit a network limit for a single download. Upon checkout at 5:30 AM, they had a table next to the desk with coffee, juice and cookies for those leaving before the restaurant opened. Another total surprise.

The pillows wasn't so great, they were unshapen, maybe it was the heavenly bed style, but i didn*t like it. I didn't complained these, because it was not a big problem. In the rooms there was keylocks, bath, security box and big lcd-tv with 40 channel options. There was three breakfast options: Cheapest was 21\u20ac/per day/per person. I would suggest this hotel to everyone. If it would be possible, it would be very great if you could get sunny from the pool.

Great view of the Brandenburg gate from our hotel window and a kettle in the room with coffee and tea as well as the usual nice Westin amenities. The spa at the hotel was very nice (huge pool and nice jacuzzi) and the $8 extra they charge for access to the sauna rooms is well worth it as there are three different saunas, and showers and a foot soaker and it was immaculate.

I had expected the city to be completely modern as a result of the city being rebuilt after WWII. In fact, 33% of the city was destroyed. In fact, the part of the city that was known as West Berlin does seem to be much more modern though there are still many interesting sites to see in that section. I found much more interesting architecture and culture east of the Brandenburg Gate. And it\u2019s just east of the Gate that you\u2019ll find the Westin Grand hotel. Few hotels are situated as centrally as the Westin Grand is to the main sites. Within walking distance is nearly every major attraction Berlin has to offer. And its right in the middle of one of Europe\u2019s most upscale shopping districts. The hotel is also situated across the street from a U (underground) line and two blocks down from a major S line. Directly behind the hotel on the main street that leads to the Gate is a good value-priced German restaurant called the Nanteck or something like that. If you\u2019re interested in a truly historic restaurant a quick ten minutes walk to the east called the Bur Letzten Instanz (I may have misspelled) that has been in business since 1621. The hotel staff all spoke English. The business center was helpful when needed. And the bath was deep and the water hot \u2013 just the cure for an aching body that walked all over town in 10 degree weather. If you\u2019re visiting Berlin in the winter, a few tips: bring warm clothes, bring study warm boots, and be prepared to walk on top of the snow because the Berliners don\u2019t try to fight the snow by melting. Rather, they tend to put dirt and small stones on top of it to improve traction. Location aside, this is a very nice, upscale hotel. Lobby is expansive and well appointed. We did not visit the pool or the gym though I would expect both to be nice. Rooms were very clean and a bit on the smaller side. Beds were very comfortable. We chose this hotel primarily because of the location and because we were using points. I love the Starwood Preferred program. We\u2019re clearly not the target audience for this hotel though because they seem to be interested in customers who have no cost concerns. I\u2019m more on the frugal side and this is definitely an \u00c0 la carte place. Even basics that I\u2019ve come to expect with all hotels were not included such as instant coffee. The only option for coffee is room service at 10 Euros. The water was 8 Euros. Thank goodness I didn\u2019t need to learn the price for an internet connection.

One side of the bed was blocked by a giant armchair, meaning you could only get in and out of the bed on the other side.

Thank you Westin for NOT installing one of those awful vending machine-style mini-bars. There are also a number of food courts located below ground level in the blocks adjacent. The location was ideal, with a lot of major attractions within walking distance in each direction, whether it be Museum Island to the east, Brandenburg Gate to the west, or Checkpoint Charlie and the Jewish Museum to the south. Even the Gemaldegalerie and Neue Nationalgallerie are within walking distance, just past the Sony Center to the east. As to the facilities in the hotel itself that I used, I can say that the Gym is small, but adequate. It could use better lighting and its own music source. The pool itself is almost like a wading pool, and not setup for exercise or doing laps. There are 2 treadmills, along with several ellipticals and stationary bikes. They also have a full complement of dumbbells, along with one fixed multi-station workout machine which just barely fits. Again, adequate but could be improved. As to the room itself, its excellent for keeping out noise - both external and from other rooms. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, and excellent for sleeping. The flatscreen TV was of average quality, and had about 6 english language channels - CNBC, BloomBerg, CNN, SkyNews, BBCNews, and ESPN America. The cleaning staff was also excellent, and everything was as it should be when I returned each day. As to the bathroom, it was a bit cramped and the ceiling felt a bit low. It could also use some better lighting. Unfortunately folks didn't have showers back in the Grand Hotel era, so the bath has been retrofitted with a shower contraption that is barely adequate. Water pressure was also passable. When compared to the large natural slate showers at the Lindemann's Berlin, it doesn't even come close.

The only issue with the room is that it was cold some nights and the hotel heater was not on yet, but they did bring up a portable heater which worked well when needed. My main issue was with the bill. They tried to charge me twice or extra on 4 separate occassions, so i spent more time at the reception desk than i would have wanted to. The first encounter was they had my rate in wrong. I brought proof of right rate but they still couldnt get it right until the end. Then i had drinks at the bar and transferred original check to another check, but they charged me for 2 checks and the lady in check in was very rude and pretty much called me a liar when i said i wanted credit for my 11.5 euros( she was on duty early saturday morning around 1:00 am at the desk, dont recall her name, but not very kind at all to guests). Then i bought something in mini bar,... i came down and paid it, then got charged for it.

Finally it was correct and I was on my way. So if you stay here, i advise you to examine your bill every day and examine it closely.

Unfortunately breakfast not included in our rate. As we understood it was mega expensive we ate at the Einstein Cafe virtually next door, but the main Einstein Cafe on Unter den Linden offered a wonderful choice for breakfast.

Felt overall decor was rather \"beige\" and needed a bit of colour to sharpen it up. Relaxing with a drink on the outside seating area was great but not cheap. Underground stop right nearby and TXL stop for airport just up the road on Unter den Linden. Only E8.40 for all 4 of us to get to the airport - a bargain! Everyone at the hotel was helpful and our room was ready 2 hours ahead of the published check-in time. As a frequent visitor to London, I am used to virtually free admission to museums and galleries. Not so in Berlin, except Reichstag. It cost us \u00a340 for the 4 of us to get into the Checkpoint Charlie museum and, although others are cheaper, it makes a dent in spending money. Not a huge choice of restaurants close to the Hotel but mainly enjoyed the ones we visited. Notable exception was Dressler.

Clearly a theme here as the pleasant pool and spa area also charges 8 euros for guest to use the sauna - the powerplate machine is also roped off and you pay to use that too - but traumatised by the water experience we used neither", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "bradthiele", "ReviewID": "UR65919580", "Content": "0Just got back from a three day break in Berlin.

We booked a suite on points and the hotel and staff exceeded our expectations. The check in was personal and friendly. When we walked into the gigantic suite with a living room at least 400 square feet, we were delighted to see a bottle of wine, three arrangements of flowers, a three tiered silver tray of chocolates, cookies, and fruit. The suite had two bathrooms, one with double marble sinks, bathtub, and seperate shower. The bath products were Bulgari. The bed was Heavenly!!!!! The location was better than perfect. It is on the corner of Freidreichstrasse and Unter de Linden. Literally 100 feet from the metro and 3 blocks from the train station. The gallery Lafayette is across the street. Linden bakery next door, along with a half dozen great moderately price restaurants. Dietrich, the concierge is the consummate gentleman, and extremely knowledgeable about everything and more than willing to assist with any requests. House keeping is immaculate. The only negative is no coffee service in the room. But if you call room service, they will send you a coffee pot to boil water along with some instant coffee. After that we bought some instant coffee from Rossman's to last the next seven days. Breakfast was exemplary. They had rollmop herring, herring in wine sauce, herring in creme sauce,, lox salmon, prime rib, all kinds of meats,pates, cheeses, breads, great selection of very fresh fruits,yogurts, omelettes to order, strawberry and banana smoothies, grains, and a great selection of pastries. Coffee was delicious. I know people have complained about paying 29 Euros for this, but to be honest the food is top quality, and you do not have to eat the rest of the day. We usually took an apple and plum from the basket, and this was our lunch, thereby allowing more time for sight seeing. To our surprise, one afternoon, they had an hour concert on the grand middle stairway, featuring three opera singers, and a 7 year old violinist accompanied by someone on their grand piano! The swimming pool and hot tub are great along with the staff. The workout room is huge. It is a convention hotel, but the ambience is great. The hotel is very quiet, inside and out. They have a large section of the Berlin Wall outside the hotel, and by appointment , they will supply guests with a hammer and pick to chisel out your own piece of history. Please look at the glove store Roeckl. It is German made high quality gloves for men and women. High end shops all over. Wempe (Rolex, Patek Phillipe, Cartier) across the street. If you \"need\" a blue Buggatti or Mercedes, they are across the street also. We much preferred this part of town to the KaDeWa area. That are has turned into Time Square in New York. The Westin is a few blocks from the State Opera, right around the corner from the Komiche Opera, and within a 10 minute walk to Museum island and the Reichstag. Thank you for sharing your great hospitality and food for seven days. We have stayed in Baden-Baden at The Breners twice and the the breakfast food exceeds theirs by far.

This was during the great volcano debachle. We checked-in and were given a great hotel on the fifth floor looking out at the Under Den Linden. The room was beautiful, and the windows were insulated. You couldn't really hear a thing at all. We slept soundly. It was a suite with a living area and separate bedroom. The bathroom only had a shower which was fine for us. Everything looked brand new. The only drawback was the lack of art or decoration in the room. That made it a bit odd and aseptic. However, I think this was because they had just been renovated. We did the breakfast buffet the first day because we were a little travel weary. It was 29euro for each breakfast which is pricey, even for Berlin. As a treat, it was really great. They had breakfast selections from around the world, and you could try anything you like. We got a kick out of sampling all the different kind of breakfast items - salmon, cheese, muesli, eggs to order, fresh baked bread, meats, fruit, etc. You should try it at least once. Berlin loves its breakfast, and you will too. The location of the hotel was wonderful. It was close to both the U6 (Franzosische) and U2 (Stadtmitte) subway stops. Very convenient for getting to our favorite neighborhood - Prenzlauer Berg. This neighborhood has great boutiques, great dining options and unique bars. There is so much more beyond the Mitte. Go out there and find it. For a cheap but delicious breakfast or lunch, try Schall & Rauch on Gleimstrasse. It's a great casual jumping-off point for a day in East Berlin. Take the U2 to Schonhauser Allee. The downstairs hotel staff was amazing. The barstaff was very pleasant and willing to help with anything you needed. Try the cake selection on the piano in the afternoons after a day of hitting the pavement. A very special thank you to two individuals at the Westin - Fabian, Victoria and Klaus. First, their English was nothing short of amazing. Second, they were very friendly and helpful.

There is also a bus option that can take you to some of the larger train stations in Berlin. I booked the room at the Westin on the Starwood Preferred Guest site and the rooms started at 99\u20ac which is not bad for a 5 star hotel in a large European city \u2013 only a few years ago I had to pay about 90\u20ac for a 2 star hotel in Paris. As we were a bit late at booking the room went up to 111\u20ac including taxes but without breakfast. Check in at the hotel was fast and we got room 454. The lobby of the hotel is dominated by a huge and lavish staircase leading to the first floor where the breakfast is served and where they have conference rooms and you also have an open atrium up to the various floors. Our room was a standard size room but it seemed to be newly refurbished. The floor was covered in a brownish carpet while the walls were painted in a light color. Instead of a king size bed we had gotten two single beds standing next to each other but we knew about this in advance. Westin (and Sheraton) keeps advertising about their heavenly bed and some of them are great. The beds at the Westin in Berlin were not that great in our opinion. First of all they were quite soft, the pillows were very thin and there seemed to be something in the mattress cover that made us sweat a lot at night. There were lots of lights in the room which I think is great and the windows faced Friedrichstrasse and the Bugatti showroom. We did hear a bit of the traffic noise but it was not a huge problem at night. Apart from that we had one big chair in the room with a small table, a desk with a chair and a 32\u201d flat screen TV. The TV had lots and lots of channels in German (and note that even English speaking movies are dubbed into German) so the only thing that was in English was channels like BBC News, CNN etc. But then again \u2013 you are not in Berlin to watch TV. There was also a small fridge with items for sale \u2013 a Coke was 4.5 \u20ac, a Heineken 6 \u20ac and a small red wine was 10 \u20ac just to give you an idea of the prices. There were space for both our suitcases which was excellent as some hotel rooms seems to be designed for just one suitcase even if there is a king size bed meant for two people. The wardrobe contained quite a few hangers and there was a small safe \u2013 there was even a power outlet in the safe which means that you can charge your cell phone when it is locked up. The bathroom was tiled with white and black tiles and contained a shower in the bathtub. There was a glass wall that prevented water from splashing everywhere when taking a shower and this combined with a shower curtain worked pretty good. It was fun to see that the standard amenities (like shampoo, shower gel etc) is the same that you get at the Westin in e.g. Bangkok. The location of the hotel is great \u2013 located on the corner of Friedrichstrasse and Unter den Linden you are basically in the middle of town and you can easily walk over to museum island or Brandenburger Tor. Right outside the door you will find the U-bahn station Franz\u00f6sische Stra\u00dfe and you can also walk to the larger Friedrichstra\u00dfe station to catch both U-bahn and S-bahn. There are lots of high-end shops in the area (we are talking Bugatti, Ferrari, Hugo Boss, Wempe watch store) together with department stores (like Galeries Lafayette Berlin) and lots of restaurants. One tip if you don\u2019t have breakfast included at the hotel is to grab a bit at Einstein Coffee near the hotel. Let\u2019s talk about some of the issues that were not that great with the hotel. First of all \u2013 no free internet! I\u2019m not sure how others plan their trip these days but we are very much online planners and we make a Google map before we travel and we normally need to get online to check details. The internet was 7.5 \u20ac for 1 hour at the hotel \u2013 I would rather recommend that you go to Einstein coffee nearby to get free Wi-Fi and enjoy some coffee for the 7.5 \u20ac instead. The breakfast at the hotel was 29 \u20ac per person for the buffet which is way too expensive. Yes, you can order a la carte at the hotel but still. I\u2019m sure it is a wonderful breakfast but for a person that normally just eats a small sandwich or some muesli it is not necessary to go for breakfast at the hotel \u2013 but luckily there are many small coffee shops and bakeries nearby. I have already mentioned that we were not that impressed with the beds. I also found it a bit strange that we only got one bathrobe and one pair of slippers when they knew that we would be two people staying in the room. It was not a big issue and I assume that we could have asked for another. We also had to request an iron and ironing board \u2013 the iron was good but the board needs to be replaced soon. One afternoon when we came back to the hotel we found a used cleaning cloth left by housekeeping on the desk \u2013 I have stayed at quite a few hotels but I don\u2019t think I have seen that before. But all in all \u2013 the Westin Grand Berlin this is a very nice hotel with a great location and compared to other major European capitals you seem to get the hotel at an affordable rate.

On the flip side, we were staying for a few days over the New Years Holiday and most hotels in Berlin seem to explode their rates up to three times the normal rate. Judging from the people down in the hotel bar and restaurant area, my original guess was that the age range in this Westin skews to well over 50 years old. Once I made it down to the gym & pool floor, I saw people more my age (mid 30's and early 40's). Your first impression might involve a vague musty odor pervading the entire building. It's probably not noticeable to anyone working in the hotel on a daily basis, but a guest is likely to notice this upon walking in the door each time. Upon arrival in the room, I noticed our one bed was actually two twin mattresses joined together to make a queen sized bed. It wouldn't have been so bad except both mattresses had individual bed-sized sheets, which encouraged the two mattresses to easily separate, making it very difficult to get close or snuggle a significant other. Judging from the middle-aged to senior clientele I saw downstairs, I'm guessing a lot of guests here choose to sleep in separate beds. I wonder if this is a problem with most of the rooms or just certain rooms on certain floors? There's a room safe hidden in the closet. It was big enough to hold my 15\" MacBookPro (but not very comfortably; requiring some acrobatic turns to place it into there). Internet was available via WiFi or in room Ethernet and costs 19.50 \u20ac for 24 hours (seven consecutive nights of Internet runs 100 \u20ac). The Internet was fast & thorough enough to allow me to quickly download a few movies from Apple's iTunes service to watch. Inexplicably for a hotel of this caliber, there was no alarm clock or coffee/tea maker in my room (again, I'm not sure if this is just a missing feature of our standard room or if there are simply no alarm clocks in all of the rooms). Standard rooms came with exactly two big towels, two little (hand) towels and two washcloths. The bathtub has a tiny (maybe 1/4 length) glass window (splatter guard?) for the shower. The black out drapes were very effective and as the humidity coming from the heater was pretty much zero, so I was very thankful I could open one of the windows in my room to let some fresh (and slightly more humid) air in. The Westin staff appears to be very accustomed to Americans who provide gratuities. We did room service the first evening (three items & two bottles of water came to 50 \u20ac), and the server made sure to point out that I could add an additional tip on top of the service charge at the bottom of my room service bill. And my traveling companion wasn't feeling very well another night and since there are no coffee or tea makers in the standard rooms, I went downstairs to the bar to get tea and hot chocolate (13.50 \u20ac). I gave the bartender twenty and he handed me back five (i.e. some unknown service charge, or some implied tip the bartender was helping himself to). This letdown in service was annoying. My SPG Gold card appeared to do absolutely nothing for me, which was a big bummer as I've stayed at Westin hotels that allowed me access to either a club lounge (which this Westin does not have) or a slight upgrade to a SPG floor (which this Westin also apparently does not have) with slightly upgraded amenities. According to the FlyerTalk forums, the best a SPG Gold member can hope for is an \"upgrade\" to a room that opens up into the atrium. The pictures of suites I've seen on the FlyerTalk thread look really awesome (the ones with balconies are up on the hotel's top floor, the 7th floor). For the young and adventurous, Berlin is a city full of nightlife and one of my local relatives suggested for me to go to a club named Cookies located almost directly next to the Westin. It's apparently only open on Tuesday and Thursday late nights and a doorman appears around midnight in front of a nondescript door on FredrichStrasse. Bottom line is this: There are plenty of competing hotels in Berlin with varying styles and amenities (my preference is for modern architecture and space, while other people may prefer \"Old World\" and simpler rooms). I left here feeling like I had gotten a very poor value for the money I had spent. If you are paying more than 200 \u20ac per night for a standard room, even with any extra add-ons (such as breakfast included, or free Internet), my educated and honest opinion is that you're paying far too much. And if you are dead set on staying at this Westin (for points or stay credit in the SPG Program, for example), book via the Starwood website and then check around all the discounter web sites (hoteldiscounts.com, expedia.com, etc.) to find a cheaper rate and then claim a Best Rate Guarantee. But you owe it to yourself to shop around before considering this Westin first. The Westin Grand in Berlin has some improving to do. One more helpful hint: Taxis between Tegel Airport and the Westin will cost no more than 20 \u20ac.", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cWestin Grand is good, but used to be better\u201d", "Author": "krueger33", "ReviewID": "UR52670828", "Content": "We have stayed at the Westin Grand Berlin several times in the last 10 years due to the location but also because they always had the most phenomenal New Years Eve gala party with fantastic entertainment (like a Las Vegas, aerialist and Broadway review). So after several years absence, we were excited to go there again because this time we had our extended family joining us for the festivities, which we had excitedly told them to anticipate a party above all others. Very disappointing. First of all, there had been a renovation of the lobby and rooms. While the rooms sorely needed this, the lobby did not. What used to have old-world charm (think Vienna/baroque decor), looked boringly like it was decorated by whoever decorates the Westins in places like No-wheresville, New Jersey. Color of the carpeting on the grand staircase and throughout was brown and beige. It used to be red oriental design...very regal. The old world charm of the lobby looked like it was now the business lounge at the airport. Very sad. The architecture SCREAMS for old world. How could this have been overlooked? In addition, without the gala events of years prior, this was a substandard New Years Eve bash. The band was mediocre at best. They were better when they stopped playing and put a CD on. Did not play what you might expect on New Years Eve for the more mature crowd. No Frank Sinatra. No big band. Played FAST Viennese waltzes that frustrated the couples with only modest dance ability, and then played disco. The crowd was mostly 50+. Also, the band was at the bottom of the staircase and the tables all upstairs. Had to struggle down that staircase in heels (and mine were very high) if you wanted to dance. My daughter fell trying to get down in her shoes. Not a great idea. In years past, the tables were at the foot of the staircase and once on both levels, but then they used the staircase as the \"stage\", performers moving up and down it so they could be seen by all. Food was good. Actually, the next morning, there was a buffet brunch with a different band (a quintet with sax, trombone, bass and piano and guitar) and they were excellent. They should have been the New Years Eve band. We sat there the entire 3 hours just for them. Also, as someone else wrote, there is no free water in the room! I don't call this a 5 star hotel any longer. It's a 4 star. Used to be 5, but falls short now. If you only care about the location, then it's great, but we will not stay again for Christmas and New Years. Also they really have no restaurant. There is a room for breakfast buffet, but there is no upscale restaurant. Definitely this place needs a bit of an upgrade to compare with the likes of the Ritz (with a wonderful New Years Eve party, by the way) located at Potsdamer Platz. Internet was not free either and rather expensive!", "Date": "January 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens,Greece", "Title": "\u201cVery Central\u201d", "Author": "Atena", "ReviewID": "UR51931737", "Content": "Unfortunatelly I only stayed one night at the Westin so I guess I will only repeat what most other reviewers had to say.

My son, his wife and me granny and my husband. My son and his family usually stay in 5 star hotels and have travelled worldwide My husband and I are lesser mortals and were relishing the prospect of staying in the Westin. A treat for Christmas---my son said he had \"got a good deal\"!. First the positive thoughts about our stay. Berlin is a great city. Lots to do. Tasty reasonable food and drink. Super transport system. Friendly people, and jolly Christmas markets around every corner. We even had a little snow!. The Westin is in a great location,. Comfortable bedroom. Delicious breakfast (with champagne). Mostly friendly staff, smiling chambermaids. Effecient lifts. But, little things did surprise me happening in a 5 star hotel. On arrival,Reception did not seem to have any knowledge of the childrens occupancy in their parents room. A \"single\" was hurriedly installed and they had to sleep top to toe, which led to sleepless nights for all concerned. Now maybe my son made a mistake by not booking the right room, but the children were on his booking fform but not on the hotels data. Is it possible that the Westin can only accommodate one child per regular bedroom and if you want to facilitate more than that you book a suite? Could turn out to be quite expensive and not very family friendly. After booking in there was no porter in sight. Reception pointed in direction of lifts and it was a case of find your room. At this stage I did not feel very welcome. Amazed at the price of a bottle of water,available in our bedroom E8.50. In Ireland complimentary bottles of water are readily available in hotels with lesser stars. (Maybe it has to do with our rainfall in Ireland). Liked to sit at night in downstairs lounge. Spectacular with roof rising to seven stories, for drinks before bed. On first night,, on the floor above , there was what appeared to be an office party. Speeches, entertainment etc., all of which encroached on the level of enjoyment of our space. Surprised also to see stains on some upholstry. Perhaps the Westin needs residents lounge with a more relaxed athmosphere. One night we were served,as part of our drinks order, with an item we did not request, When we brought this to the servers attention she reluctantly removed same. When the bill arrived this item ,which we had not ordered ,was included. Again, when this was brought to her attention, she was not well pleased. Lastly --I am one of that ,shall I say it \"dying breed\" -- a smoker!!. (Although judging from the numbers outside the front door there are still some of us around). Be warned it will cost you E150.00 if you smoke in your bedroom!! Would'nt it be nice if there was an area , within the confines of the hotel,, maybe in the garden ,to smoke ,where one would not feel so much of a outcast.", "Date": "December 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent!\u201d", "Author": "P9642Q", "ReviewID": "UR51225533", "Content": "Excellent service in a great facility, ideally located.

When we arrived, we arrived into what seems to be a film crew filing the outside lobby of the hotel, our taxi couldn\u2019t pull into the hotel therefore we had to get out on the other side of the street and as concierge was no where in sight we had to lift our own luggage into the hotel, . When I arrive at a 5 star hotel, I expect to have my luggage taken from the car to the room and vice versa and not for me to haul it around myself. The main lobby is really large, very spacious, and very grand the main staircase is the focal point of the lobby rather than the reception desks which is literally off to a corner in it self. Checking in was quick, the touch of hospitality was missing and we just didn\u2019t feel welcome. Yet again concierge was missing to help with our luggage nor were we asked if anyone could help us. We arrived to our room which in disappointment was not what we asked for; we checked into a twin room rather than a king size room with what they called a deluxe city room which in fact was over looking a loading bay. I went down stairs with my partner and so we complained as we were staying there 3 nights and didn\u2019t really want a twin room with a horrible view for our nights there. The receptionist didn\u2019t want to help at first and argued with us and basically said a few harsh uncaring words and when my partner intervened he looked up the booking and found that reservations made a mistake, as an apology he upgraded us to the superior room. To us, I found that really nice. Arriving in the superior room really lived up to its name, it was a large quiet toned room, large king size bed, large flat screen, lounge chair, office desk and chair, large wardrobes, coffee and tea making facilities, safe, side and reading lamps, lovely bathroom with both shower and ceiling rain shower, really nice and what I was really looking for! The cherry on the cake was the view! The view of the room over looked Unter den Linden, on the right your view was the Berlin TV Tower and Berlin Dom and on the left was the view of the Dome on the Reichstag. Even better were the windows with blocked out the noise and traffic. As always in Westin Hotel, the breakfast was delicious; however there were a lot what seemed to be package holiday guests where a herd of cows had more manners, waiting patiently was a word I think they never heard of. The breakfast staff were really great, friendly and attentive and therefore we thought it necessary to tip as many of the staff did a really good job. The lounge in the hotel is really nice, the bar is located at the steps of the grand stair case with the restaurant at the far corner, the seating area is really loungie, laid back and comfortable, also good service in both food and drinks and the staff I found to be really nice. The spa however was very disappointing for a hotel of that size, the swimming pool is round and fairly small, 4 or 5 strokes pending on how long your arms are and you are at one end of the pool, there is a whirl pool and a sauna where you have to pay 8 Euros to use. There is a relaxing / seating area around the pool where it is never clean, there are towels what people have used from early in the day left on the chairs and un removed. There is a bar by the pool but no bar man to serve you, you can find him out in reception flirting with the female receptionists. In all, I will stay in this hotel again and see what service I get again and booking a better room the superior or junior suite rooms over looking unter den linden which was recommended by the check out clerk, I would stay for the location, the rooms, the food and the ambience. I think concierge needs to concentrate on their skills and the spa area needs improvement but in all it is a great hotel, with a great location and grand features in the heart of Berlin.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Koege, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel with a drawback\u201d", "Author": "Frequent_traveller68", "ReviewID": "UR39367037", "Content": "We came to The Westin this Friday afternoon by car and was greeted by the valet who took our suitcases and offered to park our car in a nearby carpark which was a great start for our stay. At reception we were equally friendly greeted and the porter too us to our room on the 6th floor. A very nice and comfortable room. The next morning we went to the breakfast restaurant and here we were charged \u20ac 29 per person for breakfast. I agree it was a great breakfast but it was also a great price which I think should be lowered by about 20%. On Saturday we had decided to have the open air barbecue, but as it was a bit chilly we decided to have dinner at the hotel restaurant Relish, but that was a mistake. The waiter told us that we could sit anywhere, but that he did prefer that we took a table in the the lobby which we declined and choose the restaurant as we wanted some privacy. Drinks were then offered and came quickly together with the menu. And then absolutely nothing happened for 18 minutes although more guests had come into the restaurant. Finally the waiter appeared and took our order for the meal and for a bottle of house red wine. According to the menu the wine was supposed to be a 2003 vintage but he brought a 2001 vintage. I told him so, and his remark was that alle the house wines he had served were the same and he never checked the year. Whe he opened the bottle and poured a small amount into the glass there was plenty of residue from the corck but he pretended not to notice. Again after waiting a long time for the lobster starter it arrived, but the bisque was lukewarm. The rest of the meal still took a long time to be served and twice we had to ask the waiter to fill our glasses as he had placed the bottle far away from our table although I told him to place it on our table which apparently was against the rules. I do think that the waiter had far too many tables to look after and not until all the tables in the restaurant were occupied did a second waiter appear. This meal was a serious disappointment to us as we had a special occasion to celebrate.

The Public Spaces provide you with a luxuriously spacious ambience. The graceful Guestrooms are well appointed with the finest amenities. The wood Furniture quality was not that consistent for a 5 star Hotel, but the Bed was heavenly. The only elements missing from the room were an iron, ironing board and espresso machine. The compact well-designed modern washroom has been completely retrofitted with adequate lighting, white marble, back-painted glass panels in the shower and clever plumbing fixtures. A separate toilet compartment would have been preferred, but considering this is a historical Hotel; it would have been extremely costly to include this feature typically found in 5 star Hotels. Breakfast was quite expensive at 30.00 euro, but I guess this price is geared towards business travelers, as opposed to us on Vacation.

(marriott review also posted) altho the hotel in all fairness is good and I was lucky enough to have one of the few rooms with a balcony and with a great coffee machine, good news as I love my coffees so this did delight me (ironically tho- they daily kept forgetting to put in new coffee and tea capsules- I can only assume this is new feature and the staff have not been told to replace the ones used?). The location is also very good, in easy walking distance of most tourist locations, the remains of checkpoint Charlie just up the road from here (I lament the fact I did not visit 20 years ago as there is little left to make this city of real historical interest tho) and the majority of the staff are very good- partic those serving in the (breakfast) restaurant who get full marks for excellent service. Breakfast was fine- but little things missing you would expect from a 5 star- eg fresh fruit juice and decent coffee? There is a pool and a gym- which I did not have time to use- and I had visions of very old fashioned facils as well so was not keen to do so. And a so called garden which is not overly inspiring.. the street terrace cafe/resataurant (on one of the main shopping streets) is good- even if the prices are not- I think 11 euros for a glass of wine is ridiculous... food in the hotel was similarly over-priced. Which seems typical in downtown Berlin- geared up for tourists as I would not think Berliners would pay the prices (partic with 20% local unemployment)? The clientele in this hotel was more diverse than in the Marriott- (which was predom American when I was there)- this hotel had Italians, French, American, Brits and quite a lot of Russians. And dogs. Quite a lot of older couples and families- and anyone liking a more traditional hotel with an older style/profile might like this hotel- although I did regularly hear comments re the rooms being small and very dark so I suspect quite a few shared my view on the rooms and decor? This type of older, (1920s) grander style hotel is not for me tho. On entering: the main lobby/lounge and staircase somehow reminded me of the titanic in an obscure way- but drabber... they have refurbished the hotel I think recently (?)- but why oh why choose dark brown for the carpets and decor? this makes the lobby and long windowless corridors seem even darker and makes it look grim and characterless. Same with the bedrooms- they are brown, very brown, with light wood furniture which I also did not like. The bathroom with a rainforest type walk in shower (no bath- but this was not a problem) also was ok - and I was delighted to see it was not brown but a beige colour! Full marks tho for the (fresh capsule) coffee machine- altho not for the refill service- I ended up hijacking staff in corridors and/or calling the reception on a daily basis. The bed was good- although I think the Marriott bed is even more heavenly than the Sheraton/Westin/Meridien group's heavenly bed- perhaps by a whisker tho as still very good... Wake up calls were good- and I loved the way they told you the day's weather forecast. This was great and very useful. I was actually quite glad to leave this hotel as after a few days the drab brown was beginning to drive me mad...

This hotel is one of the best hotels I've visited around the world, luxurious and worth every eurocent of the price we paid (100 eur/night - some kind of promo). Upsides - Rooms are clean, new, spacious, with LCD TV and all the amenities you'd expect from a 5* hotel. The hotel itself is clean, elegant with excellent service. The hotel is located IDEALLY, in the heart of Mitte, right next to a U-bahn station, 5 min walk from Friedrichstrasse major train station (Where the airport express train stops) and with all Mitte attractions within a walking distance. But the best thing is the bed - I've NEVER slept on a more comfortable mattress. It was so good to come after a hard day of walking, eating, drinking and sleep for 6 hours and wake up like new. I would buy the bed and ship it home if the price wasn't so high (Around 3000 euro). Seriously, it was the BEST bed ever :) Downsides are very few and most of them concern the high price of the extras: Internet is 9 euro for 1 hour of in-room internet, or 20 euro per day or 120 per week - C'mon, in some countries you pay 9 euro PER MONTH for broadband intenet connection. I'm sure if they reduced the price people would use it more. Minibar and the bar downstairs are also extremly expensive, but it's a 5* hotel, so I'm not surprised. There are more than enough places around to drink a beer or have a small breakfast/lunch, so don't bother using these hotel services. The LCD is somehow blocked and you cannot connect external devices such as your laptop or cellphone in case you want to watch something. TV channels could use some MTV or alike, most English speaking channels are news channels. View from the rooms could be better but there's nothing to do about it - it's in the middle of the historic center and I guess they can't build high there. Berlin itself is one of the best cities in europe, for both young and older people, with lots of sight-seeings, bars, clubs, good restaurants and around town the prices are much more fair and reasonable than other places in western europe.

While it's location and staff can't be faulted I felt the cost of some things were over inflated for what was on offer. First the good stuff; I arrived 2 and a half hours before check in to drop my bag off and chanced my arm by asking if our room was available, the reception staff were very friendly and checked me in no problems. I went up to my room and found it had twin beds rather than the queen-sized I had reserved, so I went back down and they moved me, again no problems. The second room was much better as it had the bed I'd asked for and this time overlooked the inner gardens. (So if you're not happy at first just ask and see what they can do). I had checked out the hotel on-line before booking and they claim to have the best beds in the industry, well after two nights on them i definetly agree! huge beds with a very comfy mattress; so comfy we slept in both mornings! Now the gripes; Used the Gym and swimming pool and found both of these a good standard, only slight gripe is the overflow drain in the pool sounded like a Formula 1 car was parked next door. We also paid for the Sauna which was 8Euros each and not really worh it. The Sauna had two smallish mixed saunas (95F & 65F) and a female only sauna; and that was it, no steam room or plunge pool and overall felt pretty cramped. Having stayed in similar-rated hotels and used their saunas I would definetly say this one is slightly below par. We also ordered breakfast in our room the first morning and were very happy with the hotels 'healthy food' menu much cheaper than the other options (which makes me think they're just trialling it?) and very tasty. However we ordered a tea and coffee with our food and I couldn't believe that it cost 8Euros for a (small) pot of coffee and 7.5Euros for a (equally small) pot of Tea! So all in our food was cheaper than our drinks. Maybe I'm being a bit naieve about hotel bills but I still think this is over the top. On our second morning we had the buffet breakfast which again had a good selection and was very tasty but compared with similar hotels was (in my opinion) at least 5Euros overpriced, again not a huge amount but couldn't help feeling that we were paying for some kind of perceived privelige.

The location is excellent, central to shopping, culture, and transportation. The athletically disposed will find excellent jogging or walking along the nearby river Spree and the leafy Tiergarten, not to mention the full service spa (the last unfortunately is almost entirely devoid of windows, so the pool is strictly indoors in both fact and feel). The staff is invariably helpful, and the rooms are nicely furnished. In nice weather (OK, we are talking Berlin, so this is not every day) there is a sidewalk terrasse for drinks and light fare. I especially value the accomodations on the inner (garden) side for their idyllic quiet, but first time visitors might want to specifically request something with more of a \"cityscape\" view, especially those that give out onto the Unter den Linden. The fact that Westin participates in Starwood's frequent stay program, as far as I am concerned the best program of its type, is also a major plus, allowing members to earn or use points at this property. Downsides at the WGB are few: guests exceptionally concerned with tranquility (and I put myself in this category) may find that door closures are highly sprung, and unintended jarring slams from adjacent rooms are likely to awaken individuals who wish to retire early or sleep late. All hotels of this caliber ought to have quiet-close doors with pneumatic mechanisms, but only a few choose to implement this technology. Also, the hotel has been renovated, and not all changes are welcome. The new furniture has a rather bland bleached grain, and compared with the previous warm honey colored rooms, the look is sterile. There's a similar loss of color in the still grand lobby, which needs some punch color accents or flowers to return to its full glory. Also, the renovation converted almost all of the restaurant space into retail stores, so in-hotel dining is restricted to a small functional extension off the lobby. Fortunately, there is no shortage of more atmospheric restaurants in the neighborhood, and the renovation did not undermine the spectacular breakfast buffet which still takes place in a dedicated sun-filled room overlooking the Friedrichstrasse.

Safe area to walk in at night. Public areas are impressive , room always spotless, housekeeping was top notch. We called for several items during our stay, including a corkscrew, iron/board, and everytime they were delivered promptly. Room Service was delivered quickly and should be commended for adding \"healthy alternatives\" including fruit smoothies for breakfast, very nice. Wake up calls always used our name. All representative of a true 5 star property. There are some negatives. No one greeted us when we arrived, could not find a doorman or bellman When we left, we had three pieces of luggage, got off the elevator, a bellman saw us, did not acknowledge us and walked away. We checked out and got our own cab to the airport. Three times during our vist, which was 7 days, the water in the shower literally stopped and started making taking a shower difficult. It was not consecutive days nor at the same time daily so it is not a question of everyone using the water at the same time, but appears more inherent.

Best advice-buy a museum card good for 3 consecutive days-after the 2nd-3rd entry, you have paid for the card-special treats-Pergammoon Musuem and the Gemalgalerie for Vermeer, Rembrandt, Titian and other old masters.

Westin Grand I didn't hear the \u201ccan I help you with your luggage\u201d that I've heard at countless other hotels in this category around the world. The dearth of \u201cGrand\u201d employees continued inside where nobody was standing ready to relieve of us of our luggage. However, we were welcomed by the familiar view of the stunning lobby slash atrium that rises up six or was it eight stories ( I should have paid attention in the elevator) and that was it \u2013 no hotel staff to offer help, everybody was eyes down behind their counters, playing the \u201cfirt-one-to-acknowledge-the-guest-loses\u201d game. Even though we arrived at 11:00, and check-in is at 3:00, we were still given a room straight away, probably because of my gold starwood preferred guest card. Up to the room on the second floor \u2013 would be the third floor for Americans, but in Germany zero is more than nothing, it's the ground floor. Our room had an unspectacular view of a snow-covered roof garden. The room looks to have been recently renovated, with nearly all the details you would expect; soft muted tones, well appointed bathroom, plenty of hangers and drawers. No alarm clock. Isn't an alarm clock with ipod docking station standard equipment these days? No ironing board and iron, but there was a room safe, and enough room to store an ironing board and iron. There was a flat screen TV, one bathrobe and enough towels for one person. Went to call down to get another bathrobe and more towels delivered, but the phone on the desk didn't work. Went to the bed and used that one: Towels and bathrobe appeared within 5 minutes and, in the meantime, I fixed the phone on the desk myself (phone cable wasn't \u201cclicked\u201d in). The bathroom is fine, typical small european size. The shower was frustrating. It was good to look at, but using it was a pain: Two knobs to turn, but not intuitive to use. One adjusted the strength and direction of water flow, either out of the spigot \u2013 turn counter clockwise and keep turning to increase pressure, or out of the shower head, turn clockwise and keep turning to increase pressure. The right hand adjusts water temperature \u2013 counter clockwise for cold, clockwise for warm. Keep in mind that once you got the shower going you had to bend down \u2013 in the stream of water to adjust the temperature (for some reason the water temperature selected while using spigot mode, didn't correlate with the shower head temperature), all while standing on the very stupidly placed center drain. If you forgot your reading glasses \u2013 which most people don't wear in the shower for some reason \u2013 you couldn't see the markings on the knobs that were very chic and minimilistic and lacking of color (like red and blue for hot and cold). Both of us struggled with it, cursing at what we felt was an anything but ergonomic design. Otherwise the bathroom was fine. We didn't like the american style bed setup, preferring the standard european dual duvet setup, preventing the tug of war in the middle of the night. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Super variety, along with all the ingredients needed for that important Sunday morning mimosa. My only complaint would be that some hotels seem to think that under-cooked, runny, scrambled eggs are tasty \u2013 I don't. Why not offer two types, runny and cooked? Before leaving on Sunday afternoon we had coffee and cake (a true German tradition) in the lobby. While both were very good, the price left me gasping for air: 30 Euros, without tip, for two slices of cake and two coffees! This went beyond the term \u201cpremium pricing\u201d. We should have sat at the window where we could see the million Euro Bugatti across the street \u2013 maybe then it wouldn't have seemed so outrageous. Sound like a bad review? Well it's not. We both like the Westin Grand and probably will be going back, now that we know how to use the shower. We never need help with our luggage when we arrive at a hotel, so that didn't bother us \u2013 it was just noticeable. While we've stayed in several hotels that offer ipod docking stations, that's another feature we never use. I do think an iron and ironing board would be appropriate. The breakfast buffet was great and I'm glad it was included in the price of the room. I shudder to think what it would cost if paid for separately.... The Westin's location is great: Right across the street from a subway station. Just up the road from Brandenburger Gate and not far at all from the museum island. Check out Lafayette Gallery just over and beyond the subway station for some serious shopping and KaDeWe-like food section \u2013 complete with spectacular bakery. Right around the corner from the hotel \u2013 on the backside of the hotel (out of the lobby go left around the building) directly on \u201cUnter den Linden\u201d street is a great German restaurant offering up traditional German & Berliner fare. The prices were excellent when you consider the quality of food and the location.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice hotel!\u201d", "Author": "beechmi", "ReviewID": "UR25115136", "Content": "I just returned from a quick trip to Berlin and my second stay at the Westin Grand. This is a strong 4 star hotel...not on the level of a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons, but nice enough and a good value for the money. The hotel is rather famous from the movie and stage musical 'Grand Hotel', and was a very popular place to stay back when the city was divided. The lobby and main entrance are very nice, but the rest of the common areas of the hotel look a bit dated. And btw....I booked my room on Yeego.com, and not only did I get a much better rate than the Starwood website, but the breakfast buffet was included, and with Yeego you get a 3% credit towards a future reservation via their website. The hotel is located a block south of the Unter Den Linden in the eastern part of Berlin and next to the Opera House. It is a safe and excellent location if you need to stay in the eastern part of Berlin (personally I prefer west Berlin) close to most of the higher end shopping, American Embassy and the Brandenburg Gate. It is also close to several office buildings and therefore becomes rather quiet and deserted at night (except for the Opera House next door). My room was very clean, recently renovated, with a contemporary modern look, a very comfortable bed, great linens, a desk, and luggage storage area. The bathroom was a decent size with a nice size tub and European style shower. It was located in the back of the hotel and very quiet...I never heard a word from another guest. The hotel is quite large, so if you have trouble walking I suggest you request a room towards the front elevators since it is a hike to the rooms in the back (or west corner) of the hotel. The only change I noticed from when I stayed here before is that the exercise and pool area downstairs have been renovated. I exercise everyday and was very impressed and pleased with this tiny gym. All the equipment looked brand new with one of those multi-use bench press, leg extension, and lateral pulldown machines, as well as dumbbells, and Lifestyle treadmills, stationary bikes and eliptical machines. The pool is nice too, but not large or deep enough to swim laps in. I found the breakfast buffet outstanding with just about everything you can imagine available. All types of prepared eggs (on request omelets, scrambled & fried eggs), bacon, sausage, cold meats, cereals, breads, juices, and even champagne! I did not pay extra for it as it was included in my room. I think the hotel was charging around 18 euro, and in my opinion that is a reasonable price for what it offered. The only things I didn't like were the high charge for use of the wireless internet (7.50 euro per hour, or 19.50 euro for 24 hours) and the 8 euro fee to use the sauna downstairs. And for what its worth, I booked my room on Yeego.com, and not only did I get a much better rate than the Starwood website, but the breakfast buffet was included.

The suite was large, wonderfully appointed, had a great deal of character and charm, and was ideally situated (fourth floor, right at the front of the building with a large balcony). Tons of closet space, wood paneling in certain areas, a huge bathroom (with dual sinks, walk-in shower, seperate bathtub, lots of counterspace, and a separate toilet area also with its own sink and a bidet), work desk, sitting area, yet more and more closet space, flatscreen TVs, minibar, and so on.

Breakfast was okay but overpriced even by European chain hotel standards, especially with the cafes of Unter den Linden only steps away. That's the main plus of this hotel--great location in the heart of Mitte, with an express bus from the airport stopping only a block away. And almost everything I wanted to see in my off hours was an easy walk from the hotel. Service, however, is appalling for a chain hotel of this calibre and price range. When I arrived at 1 pm, I was told that I couldn't check in till 3. That's not unreasonable. I was told to leave my bag at the front desk and it would be taken to my room when I came back. Well, arriving at three, I checked in, got a key, walked into the room, but surprise! My luggage wasn't there, though somebody else's was. Traipsed back to the front desk, waiting for the front desk staff person to finish a phone call. When I told him about the problem, he asked \"Are you sure?\" C'mon, the one thing people are likely to be really sure of is what their suitcase looks like. They issued me a new room key and told me to wait for a bit till someone could help locate my bag. Half an hour later, waiting in the glittering lobby, I had to get in line again at the front desk and ask when someone could help me. This time I was told to accompany a non-English speaking guy into the baggage room and he pantomimed to me to see if my luggage was there. Frankly, as a woman traveling alone, I wasn't crazy about being alone n a secluded part of the hotel with a male staffer. But it was equally disturbing that hotel guests' property wasn't better secured. Honestly, I could have taken as many bags as I wanted for all they cared. As it turned out, my bag wasn't there. Back to the front desk, who suggested that I go back to my room and when the bag was found, they'd call me. Two hours went by without a call. I asked to speak to the manager and was told that I could file a lost baggage claim for compensation as long as I had proof of the contents of my bag. I think that's about when I lost it. After a small but well earned public tantrum, the manager said he would look into the situation himself. Twenty minutes later, they found the bag--apparently another guest found it in his or her room and had brought it down to the main desk hours earlier.

The breakfast is the best I have ever had anywhere, it's the only place I have ever stayed where you can have a bucks fizz in the morning. It is also the only hotel I have stayed in where i can get a Grasshopper cocktail. If I have one critisism to make it is the pool is far too cold, you can only stay in there for a short while. Having said that I would recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "August 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again just for the pool!!!\u201d", "Author": "kleim27", "ReviewID": "UR8274108", "Content": "This is a very nice hotel in a very nice location. The service is above average, and the indoor pool is the nicest I have ever seen. The only downside to this hotel is the small rooms with no king-size beds.
