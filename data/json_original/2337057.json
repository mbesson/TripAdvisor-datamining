One of our luggage lock has been broke open during our stay in the hotel and up til today we've yet to hear back from the management in regard of our complains yet. Location: You can call it good or bad. Good: you're only 2 stations away from AMS airport without the need for a transfer. Sloterdijk Station is not only a train station, but also a public transportation interchange with Bus and Tram service that'll take you to different part of the city. Bad: It is pretty far away from most major attraction and getting back to the hotel late at night can be a problem as night buses aren't direct and frequent. Note: take the bus from the hotel if you're going downtown, tram takes twice as much of time and involve a transfer. Purchase a day pass that cost 7.5EURO on bus or tram. Security: Poor. One of our luggage has been broken into with our lock damaged, luckily nothing was missing as nothing valuable was stored in it. The hotel didn't really provide an answer for us nor does it provide any type of compensation or assurance that they'll look into the matter. Rooms are NOT equipped with safety deposit boxes for valuable, if you've something expensive take it to the lobby for them to lock it up for you. But out of our 2 attempts to have something locked in the deposit box at the lobby, none of the attempts were successful, none of their staffs are well trained enough to know how to operate the box! What a joke! Service: 1) Front Desk Lacks Efficiency 2) The front desk missed 2 morning calls in a row, when we call and reconfirm the night before each time. 3) Breakfast is chaotic, at max 2 person is serving a breakfast area with almost 100 people eating. Tables are left uncleaned for ages and have to stood and wait for over 15 mins before somebody comes and cleans it. Food runs out as soon as it arrives on the table and the refill is snail slow. I had 2 bad eggs out of my 3 breakfast there. Cleanliness: Poor, my bathroom wasn't properly cleaned out of all the nights I have stayed in. There are dust balls that form at the corner of my room. Hotel Facilities and Dinning: Free WIFI is available across the hotel but speed is inconsistent, there are a few desktop computer by the front desk that provides internet access. No other facilities that I've used during my stay. The breakfast as I've mentioned is chaotic and terrible. Staffs are rude, tables are uncleaned, food table empty and eggs are bad. Eat else where if you could. Sleep Quality: Although this is a bad enough hotel, sleep quality here isn't bad. Beds are comfortable enough and the aisles are generally quiet. Conclusion: I'd not recommend this hotel unless you've got yourself a great deal. Even that please do take good care of your personal belonging. There are many smaller individually run hotel in the downtown area going for about the same price as this place, try those before trying here.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ISLE OF MAN", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a very handy location, only a short hop (5 minutes by train) from Central Station\u201d", "Author": "DIANE D Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR127693391", "Content": "Travelling on motorbikes and hearing about many bike thefts in Amsterdam, finding a hotel with secure parking was paramount for us.

I found the rooms to be brand new and wonderful -- especially the bathroom. Great shower and great water pressure. I was also glad they had such a variety of TV channels -- including channels in English. The coffee and tea in the room was also a nice touch. The only negative about this property was the lack of iron and ironing board in each room. They apparently only have one for the entire hotel. This caused some problems for us, as we had just arrived off a flight from Dallas and needed ironed clothing ASAP for a dinner we were attending. I've seen some reviews about the location being poor but I found it to be excellent. It's literally just a 4-5 minute train ride into the Central Train Station which is the stop you want for all of the main Amsterdam attractions. Between all the various means of public transportation, you can get to the city centre in about 10 minutes or less. No biggie at all.

It is a 5 min walk to the front entrance whhich located near the bus plaza. It takes about 10 min by train to get to Amsterdam Centraal or Schiphol by train, and these trains run every 5 to 10 minutes. (Schiphol is 3,20 euro 1 way for an adult or 2,50 for a road runner ticket child up through age 11) As mentioned before the (double) automatic doors can be a bit annoying and yes the elevators are not that big. However there are 2 of them. Check in was quick and efficient, room was ready. The room was clean and was serviced during the day that we were gone, we had no issues with cleanliness during our stay. The window opens (tilts in) and if you are facing the trainstation, with the window open, yes you will have noise. There are individual room controls on the wall. Wifi was available and free and was quick enough. The room had 2 single double size beds I believe, they were relatively comfortable with 2 pillows each. Flat screen tv with plenty of channels. There is no inroom safe, however the front desk has safes available. The shower was clean (good size), with 2 big towels and 1 smaller one, no wash cloth. Body wash/shampoo/soap all in one dispenser are located near the sink and in the shower. The shower and room were well contructed with no issues. The hotel is new and it shows. There is no onsite restaurant. The front desk has a menu. They do not deliver and are only open till 10pm. So I recommend to have eaten or have some food with you if you arrive after 9.30 pm. There is no fridge or microwave in the room. There is the inroom water heater with instant coffee and tea. We did not have breakfast, did have a drink at the bar downstairs. Prices were decent. Issues: - the tv was still set to Winter time, and I could not change it. - I asked for a wake up call and never received it!!!! it could be more if...... If they work on the overall service a bit. I would give this hotel a 4 instead of a 3. The hotel is new and clean, the rates are good and the location is convenient. There just are the inconsistencies between the service received. Once that is worked out it would be a lot better. Let me know if you have any questions.

People with mobility problems should make sure they access the hotel via the low-level floor of the station as that is the same level as the entrance to the hotel. Make sure you eat in the centre as there were no restaurants open nearby.though.....there was a kiosk/bar which was closed. Tip for management-please ensure there is a plentiful supply of rolls being baked when at breakfast time and consider extra staff at peak times for breakfast. The only waitress was in and out of kitchen refilling dishes, trays and jugs of milk. We felt sorry for her as she was obviously overworked and doing her best, yet smiling all the time.
