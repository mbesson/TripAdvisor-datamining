We stayed three nights that gave us just enough time to have a brief visit to Barcelona. The room was just the size and with a third bid for our kid it felt a bit crumpled. The window was in front a residential building, so the view was the kitchens and hanging clothes of the neighbours. When we arrived I noticed that the bathroom lock was not working, so I reported to reception. They promised to fix it but the next night it was still broken, and because it was Saturday they could not fix it, so we stayed with the broken lock for all weekend that was not very convenient. Anyway I asked for a similar room and they found one but we did not have time to move all our stuff given our little time to visit the city. Also the main elevator broke so we had to use the maintenance elevator, that made no difference at all. Anyhow, it shows that this hotel needs some proper maintenance because everything else is fine. The value of the hotel was about thirty percent cheaper compared with other hotels around this location. It was the only hotel available for this price in this location with the short time we booked it, so given this circumstances it was a good selection.

Although it's a fair old distance to La Rambla, the public transport is excellent and will have you there in under 10 minutes. The hotel is a different matter. Read on if you dare...Our check in time was supposed to be 11.50am but our room was not available until almost 1.00pm. As you can appreciate, having been up since 4.30am, we were eager to rest. Not the worst start you say, well here goes. Our room, 1006, was located on floor E (between the lobby and the first floor if you can picture it) with a single-glazed window \"overlooking\" the entrance lobby doors. Essentially, this meant that we had virtually no natural light and no privacy, as the window was not suited to sound deadening purposes. We had to keep the drapes and blackout curtain closed for the entire weekend. Combine that with the paper-thin walls (where I could hear the Italian woman next door, \"pronto, pronto, pronto\") and the picture is starting to fill out!There were cracks and water stains on the ceiling of the room. Mould was beginning to bubble and grow behind the main entrance door to the room. The air conditioning unit expelled hot air (regardless of whether the hot or cold setting was selected), thus making the room extremely uncomfortable to sleep and rest in. Hot water for showers etc. was scarce after 9.30am (evidently, it was syphoned off to the heating system). The most interesting point about the room was having what sounded like the main sewage pipe for the entire building running down the side of our bed. Every time somebody flushed a toilet it sounded as if the biblical flood of Moses was about to inundate us! So disconcerting was the noise that we had two very restless nights. That was not the extent of our suffering in Hotel Roma.On our very first night, at 1.15am, we had two intruders in the room. I heard the door to our room unlocking and I sprang from the bed just as two men entered the room. Fortunately, a loud roar persuaded them to leave rather quickly. When we tried to report this to the front desk the next morning, I had barely gotten the words 'bon dia' out of my mouth when the receptionist was apologising for the incident, which a 'guest' had already reported. Apparently the guest was drunk, had mistaken his first floor with our 'E' floor and stumbled into our room. The 'guest' maintained that the door to the room was open and he simply pushed it open and walked in. The receptionist told us that the two floors were the same in layout and that we must have forgotten to lock our door. This is not the case with any of the above.Unfortunately, I have a terrible habit with locks; I can't even drive to the shops without making sure that every door in the car is locked. This is how I know that I locked the door. I know that my partner checked it after me, as she has the same inclination. Consequently, I know that the door could not have simply been pushed open. Secondly, the two men were not drunk. They didn't stare at me when I shouted at them, as drunkards would do. Both were fully cognisant of their surrounding and left without even tripping over one another. What was most disturbing was that the second man had a key in the door and it was not the card that guests use to enter their rooms. It is this which makes me believe that it was a staff member trying to do God only knows what. Finally, I went up to the first floor to see the layout for myself after leaving the receptionist. Although the general L-shape of the building was the same on that floor, the arrangement of the doors was completely different. In my opinion, there is no way that there could be any confusion between the floors, and hence the rooms.Immediately after the 1.15am incident, somebody in the lobby started moving the furniture around the marble floor, creating a horrible screeching sound. Who, other than staff members, would be able to do this at this hour? I felt like calling ghostbusters! This cacophony continued for about two hours; I know this because it kept me awake, watching \"satellite TV\", which consisted of French, Spanish, Italian and one BBC news station. In total, there were 8 wonderfully entertaining foreign stations. I ended up having a makeshift barrier behind our locked door, \"MacGyvered\" from two suitcases and a chair. All I was short of was the double barrell and the rocking chair. The rest of the weekend in that hotel was (thankfully) relatively uneventful.Hotel Catalonia Roma was not my idea of a nice hotel by any means. I have nothing but compassion for the poor misfortunates who stay in this hotel.I have stayed at many hotels throughout Ireland and Europe, mainly budget, and this is the first time I have experienced anything like this. Needless to say, I cannot recommend the Hotel Catalonia Roma on any level. Upon investigation throughout the city itself, we found that we would have had far superior accommodation in a better location.Stay clear of this particular hotel. If there's anybody familiar with Fawlty Towers and Basil Fawlty out there, then you'll appreciate that you should avoid this place as if it were like the in-laws house.Truely dreadful.", "Date": "November 12, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Catalonia Roma", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d238750-Reviews-Catalonia_Roma-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$98 - $196*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Avenida de Roma 31</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08029</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "238750", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/e9/b6/habitacion-doble-matrimonial.jpg"}}
