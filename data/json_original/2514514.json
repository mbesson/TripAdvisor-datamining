It's within 5 minutes of Gloucester Rd Tube station and is well served by cafes, restaurants and shops. There's also a Waitrose and Sainsburys really close by. The room was clean and warm, and the shower always had hot water whenever we used it. Plenty of towels The staff on the 24-hour reception were friendly and helpful. Vending machines for hot and cold drinks and snacks are handy. Overall, I'd say this hotel is great value for money and in a really great location.

I picked EasyHotel as it was a similar price to many other central London hotels, but I worked on the basis that EasyGroup have a brand reputation to keep up and so it couldn't be too bad. I was right. When I booked I was told that it was a very small room. When I checked in I was also asked \"you do know this is a very small room don't you\". When I got to the room I realised quite how small it was. You could walk from the door of the room to the bed with one stride. The plastic shoe box that is both the shower, toilet and sink is similarly tiny. However it sort of works. It's clean and the bed is possibly the most spacious thing in the room.

The room, located in the basement via 2 sets of stairs (but no lift), was very basic, literally just a bed and bathroom facilties. Even my small 5 yr old grandson, commenting as we walked in the room exclaimed 'Is this it!!' It was very inventive how easyhotel managed to squeeze a toilet,washbasin and shower into the tiniest space. There was a tv on the wall, but you had to pay \u00a35 for use of remote (from reception). No bedside lamp, but you can control main lights (using dimmer) from the bed, a couple of sockets by the bed, but too far away from mirror in bathroom. No tea/coffee making facilities, but a vending machine in reception. Internet services I think were charged by the half hour. In hindsight I wish I'd booked a room with windows as this room felt claustrophobic, but it had air conditioning so very well ventilated. Because it was in the basement I couldn't get a signal for my mobile so had to go to street level to make calls. There isn't anywhere to sit, so we ending up sitting on the steps outside. The only problem was that that's where the smokers were as well. The hotel is situated a good 5 minutes walk from the underground.

Some smaller than others; some even only some what bigger than this place. The difference here is that you can absolutely feel this company cares nothing for the people who stay here and have no problem with swindling or tricking you. You want us to pay for the remote to the tv that might make this little orange prison feel a little less terrible; fine, I can do without it. No window? Hey, I probably would've jumped out of it by now anyway. Don't care that they're not going to clean my room. Don't care that there is no elevator and we had to lug our stuff up about 5-6 flights of stairs after a long day of traveling. And the bathroom that I could use the toilet, shower, and brush my teeth in all at once- fine. But I think they are extremely misleading calling these double rooms. Think of it this way if you happen to make our mistake and open the door to your room for the first time. Would you ever keep your dog or cat in here, even for a night? The answer is probably \"no\". So why would humans inhabit such a small space? They could have easily made this amount of room livable with shelves, a bed that could fit things underneath, more hooks.. I could go on forever. But like I said, this place doesn't care about their customers, only their money. So here's where it gets uncomfortable. You've been traveling a month through Europe and each have a regular sized suitcase. They don't really fit. You will always be tripping over them and wrestling to figure out a way to open them in the morning and at night when you need to change your clothes. Want to go to the bathroom? Good luck getting past those suitcases to the light switch, then going back around, then trying to shimmy the door open. Once inside the bathroom, where there is almost no room for anything you might need you can expect the worst. Tip: always keep the toilet seat down. My contact solution (which is a thin, small size) couldn't make it on the little ledge by the sink and promptly fell right into the toilet. This was my breaking point. Whether you stay here a day or 10 days they are only giving you one towel per person; each other towel will cost you. Seriously? I don't care that the maid doesn't clean the room; how could she when there isn't even a place to walk? But if she does for some reason be prepared to pay to store your luggage in addition to having her clean your room. As for the bed this is another story. It is at least passable for comfort, however, whoever is sleeping on the outside is going to get crushed every time the other person has to climb over them to use the bathroom. Have some things plugged into the wall? They will fall out every single time you walk by, regardless of how careful you are. If you wear glasses it's a huge struggle not to get them broken in here as there is no where to store them when you go to sleep. The tiny piece of orange that sticks out from the side of your bed is not sufficient to even hold those. How could they not put even a tiny shelf somewhere near the bed? It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this stuff out! As for the wifi you can pay for don't bother. It only works on the very lowest floor or sometimes only if you sit outside on their stoop. Easily fixable by adding routers but what do they care about you? That seems to be the ongoing theme here. And the last punch to your gut; you decide you can't take it anymore. Can we upgrade to the slightly bigger room where there is space on each side of the bed so no one gets hurt when someone has to pee? Yes, for a night here and there. But no, not really. Can I get a refund? Sure, go to our website. Website says to cancel however many days and pay a 10 pound fine- the rest will be credited to your account. Well, we didn't notice that the first time they wrote account it was actually to our \"account\". So no, you will NOT be getting back your money, despite how horrible these living conditions are. This is for your easyhotel account! Because you will definitely want to come back in the near future (within 12 months) and live through this absolute nightmare again. NO THANKS. Please beware- I know this review is long but people need to know what they are getting into. An orange prison of insanity that no one should stay in more than 1 night. A place where the staff is nice and smiles but never can actually help you. This hotel almost ruined our entire trip to London.

If you can spring for a room with a window, you might want to - it may make it feel a little less small. LOCATION: This easyHotel location was great. Safe area near a grocery store and a 5 minute walk to the tube. It appears there's an \"easyHotel Earl's Court\" location nearby that has better reviews, so you might want to check that out as well. PROPERTY: The building is in a long row of white townhouses. Nothing fancy, very basic. We were on the basement level in the back of the building. Completely quiet area, not on a main road. PLUSES: We felt we got value for our money. All we wanted was a place to sleep and shower - that's what we got. The staff were friendly. The location is central. The bed was surprisingly comfy. MINUSES: Paper thin walls mean that you may end up with noisy neighbors who keep you up all night. We stayed 5 nights. The first night and last night our next door neighbors were loudly talking and engaging in other nocturnal activities literally all through the night making it very hard to sleep. But those 3 in-between nights were pretty peaceful. Also, if you aren't one of the first to shower you'll likely end up with cold water. BOOKING: 40 pounds a night booked directly through their website. Again, check out the Earl's Court location reviews and photos - seems like it'd be worth it the spend a little extra for a window if you can. For the price, we can't complain.

And after my last experience in 2004 (Free extra blood in bed, concert from the drunk choir next door, sit on the toilet to take a shower all for just 40\u00a3 a night!) I decided to forget about London for a while. But recently the \u00a3 against \u20ac exchange rate has become to good to ignore and I had a look at what's new. It turns out a lot has changed in London. Several chains of budget hotels have arrived, and I decided to check out Easyhotel. If you -like me- take pride in travelling light and only stay for a few nights, if you are not extremely claustrophobic and not allergic to the colour orange you should defenitely check this one out. I booked two months in advance and got my room for an amazing 25\u00a3 a night. The room was a bit like something you would find on a train or boat- space kept to an absolute minimum, in simple modern design. No window, but fresh air from an efficient airconditioning system. A heavy door keeps the sound out, and the bed was fabulous, I slept like a baby. The bed was technically wide enough for two, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you *really* like each other. But I hear there are other room configurations available. The bathroom was also an exercise in space-saving. A toilet, a wash basin and a nice hot shower, with a multifunctional soap dispenser and one (1) towel. And orange, lots. All spotlessly clean, with a friendly and helpful staff member welcoming you downstairs. This hotel does not come with restaurant, breakfast room, elevators, pool, room service, wake up service, complimentary champagne, valet parking, any other kind of parking, cocktails- if you want that, go to the Hilton. If you want a good clean bed and a shower for few \u00a3 go here! There are a few other things I must mention. There is a tv in the room, but you have to pay to use it. Also, you pay for extra towels, internet, a window in your room or a linen change. This pleased me, as I didn't need any of these things and it saved me money. The room was so dark and quiet and the bed was so good I had trouble waking up in the morning. There is really no way to tell that morning has arrived, so I would recommend setting an alarm to avoid oversleeping. The location is great, short walk from Earl's Court Tube station, trough a street with a wide choice of restaurants, pubs and supermarkets.

Whenever we visit London, we do a lot of sightseeing and really only ever look for a hotel that is fairly cheap and is pretty well connected for London transport. We travel light (a backpack each only) and only ever need a decent, clean bed and shower. From the hotel's own website, and from the previous reviews, we weren't expecting a king size super spacious room (after all we had booked a room with no window, and for a pretty cheap price) but still..... I cannot stress enough just how TINY the room actually is!! One of us had to sit on the bed, whilst the other one moved around, got dressed, etc. as the room is that small - and we are not large people! Even with only having backpacks for luggage, there is no room for storage, and having things piled up behind the door, to me is certainly a fire hazard! The hooks on the wall are a bonus, but only if you are 6 foot tall, as they are so high, it is a struggle to reach them! Having stayed in a \"concept\" hotel like this before when overseas, we were expecting a little bit more (please try out the Hotel SO, Christchurch, New Zealand - again a space-saving window less room but SO much better on Design, Layout, Style, etc. and also not that much more expensive in comparison). Having both been students, where we lived with similar style bathrooms, I would say that even our student accommodation wins hand-down. Also having worked with the Prison Service, I have seen Prison Cells that are more spacious!! There is no carpet on the floor - a moneysaving trick for easyGroup - but I suppose this helps when the shower leaks under the bathroom door! And never having suffered from Claustrophobia, I suddenly experienced quite bad panic attacks in the middle of the night, as I felt completely hemmed in!! On a positive note, the room was very clean, the bed pretty comfortable and the hotel is in a nice area, and is very well located for transport. However, we will NEVER stay there again. We found the Travel Lodge the previous night was by far the best for money (at \u00a329 per night on the saver rate it was \u00a310 cheaper than easyHotel) with much more room and the use of the TV thrown in for FREE. To us, these rooms have been built with one thing in mind only - money making for easyGroup - and with very little thought to the actual customer - the budget traveller. Yes, we want cheap accommodation, but we also want a little comfort.

One person could cope OK for a night but for a couple...we literally had to take it in turns to move around. The shower room was fine with a good shower. What we really disliked was the total lack of storage space. Surely the designers could have incorporated a number of shallow recesses for small possessions to avoid having them all over the tiny floor? The main issue we had however, was being given only one thin pillow each. We asked for extra pillows and were told by Mr Surly to ask later (we were off out). We were told on our return by a different person that there were no extra pillows. As a result we had to fold up extra clothes to provide some sort of neck support. I find it hard to imagine that we are the only people to experience this problem. In every other hotel we have ever visited we have either found two pillows in the room or have been issued extra ones when required. Our night's sleep was disrupted badly by this easily rectified situation and to say we were disappointed with Easyhotels would be an understatement. Yes, the room is cheap and we didn't expect greatness but surely it wasn't too much to ask to be given sufficient pillows?

I didn't have much luggage so even that wasn't an issue....but with no window, no phone, no TV (I was not going to pay the equivilant of nearly $10 to watch a couple hours of TV) and no CLOCK in the room, it was disorienting. Then there's the bathroom. All I have to say is that it's very tiny, and that you must close the door when showering or you will flood the room....but it worked, again, the size of everything was not my main problem with this hotel. It just seems that they are almost going out of their way to make a guest's stay unpleasant by not offering free TV access for one (I can understand maybe collecting a deposit for the remote, which is returned upon checkout but it's ridiculous to charge outright for use of a remote), or even a clock, the worst part by far was the lack of a window. After a day in London, I reluctantly came back to the hotel and asked the woman at the desk if somebody could let me know when it was 10 a.m. (checkout time....no WAY was I going to be charged extra for staying later...and no phone in room means no conventional wakeup call) as I had neglected to bring my travel alarm clock and she acted like it was the most absurd question ever posed by a human being. Fortunately, I woke up early, checked out and spent the next night at a real hotel. I paid $85 VAT included for the hotel, and it was booked at the very last minute. I will admit $85 for a hotel in London is not bad, I just think that for what you get, it's not a great value. I typically use Priceline for my London hotel stays and it's not uncommon to get a 4 star there for $60-$85, and all of those places offer TV and WINDOWS! The next night I stayed at a hotel I was kind of dreading (read lots of bad reviews) the Copthorne Tara, and it seemed like a palace compared to the Easyhotel. I really wanted to like the place, like I said, I love the idea, I'd never go back unless I absolutely could not find something else at a reasonable price.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "easyHotel London South Kensington", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d550121-Reviews-EasyHotel_London_South_Kensington-London_England.html", "Price": "$32*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">14 Lexham Gardens</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Kensington</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">W8 5JE</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514514", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/1d/7c/easyhotel-london-south.jpg"}}
