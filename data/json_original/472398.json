Smells of cigarettes. Rooms on the front are extremely noisy. I can see that in summer, with the roof terrrace, it will have more to offer but there are better choices.", "Date": "February 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bangor, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBudget hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "SamThompson", "ReviewID": "UR6737986", "Content": "I booked this hotel largely on the basis of reviews that other travellers had posted. It is located in a side street not far from some of the cities leading attractions. The staff were helpful and offered us a choice of three rooms, which was unexpected, but welcome all the same. Our room smelt of tobacco smoke, which I imagine is a common experience in Turkey, as non-smoking areas, etc do not seem to be common there. The room had a comfortable bed, a small fridge/mini bar and a view of the roof of the Blue Mosque, which was illuminated at night. I had to struggle a little with the curtains to get them to fully cover the window, but the room was clean and the bathroom was adequate. Beware though, the street outside is quite noisy, businesses open early, machines clean the pavements and take away garbage in the middle of the night and mosques call the faithful to prayer by loudspeaker (there is a mosque about 50m down the street). We were delighted though by how close the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia were and in the morning the view over the Sea of Marmara was quite spectacular from the dining room. The breakfast was basic but adequate Turkish fare, cucumbers, bread, cheeses, tomatoes, olives and so on. The hotel has a small bar although I think one is open on the rooftop in the summer time, which would be lovely given the views, but as our trip was in mid winter that was not an option. Overall, the rooms could do with a little money spent on them. Ours had a wardrobe but little else to keep clothing in and we were actually locked in the room at one stage when the door lock jammed. The hotel staff though came at once and the lock was fixed upon out return later that evening. I am not sure if I would stay again. The positives are the location, in the heart of the tourist district, the views and the staff who are helpful. On the down side the location can be a little noisy and some aspects of the rooms are in need of investment. If you are on a budget by all means stay there for a few days, if you can afford to go up market a little you may be better with a but more luxury even if your view is not quite so good.", "Date": "February 3, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Legend Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d472398-Reviews-Legend_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$99 - $260*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Peykhane Caddesi No 16</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Sultanahmet</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34400 </span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "472398", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/1/3/3/8/198331/198331.jpg"}}
