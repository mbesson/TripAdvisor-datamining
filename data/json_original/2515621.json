I was a little disappointed that it did not have a microwave though. The bedding could use some updating. Internet access was great and the breakfast was excellent. Because it's located on shelter island you feel like you've \"gotten away from it all\", but no so far that you can't find a fast food place up the road.

We chose it because we saw many positive customer reviews, but it was not a good choice in the end. I would not recommend this hotel. Our first night we were placed in a first floor room next to the lobby. We could clearly hear every footstep from the room above us, and the wall heater screeched every time it shut off, which meant waking up all night long. The bathroom in this particular room was worn and dirty, with permanent stains on much of the tile grout and yellowed peeling caulk around the toilet. They said they could not move us until the second night because the hotel was full. On the second night, we got a room on the second floor, but on the bay side. We were kept up until nearly 11pm by helicopters at the navy base across the bay. They were very loud even with the windows closed (all old single-pane with no sound insulating value). The next morning, we were awakened by people walking by on the street, vehicles driving by, and a trash truck dumping the waste bins. The final insult was on our last morning there when the hot water went out. First they told us it was a scheduled water heater replacement and there was nothing they could do except bring us some boiling water to wash up with. Then they claimed the water heater had gone out and they were waiting for a repair truck. After my wife gave them an earful, somehow they managed to get some hot water in the pipes and we were able to shower before leaving. Their breakfast is quite good, and it's real food rather than something heated out of a box. But we had a lot of trouble finding anyplace to sit and eat it. If you don't mind fighting the crowd, this could be a positive for you. There are some other positives to this place, but they aren't important if you can't get a good night's sleep or a hot shower! Just do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat for families\u201d", "Author": "Jayne_SJ_CA", "ReviewID": "UR128353649", "Content": "As many of the reviews said, everyone on the staff was tremendous (kind of \"stepford wives\" nice)! We arrived before check in and they let us go into a room to change into our swimming stuff so we could wait by the pool. The rooms are fine, maybe not like one of the major business-class chains (Marriott or Hilton, say). It's wonderful to have a 'fridge in the room and free breakfast buffet. I'd recommend springing for the extra $10 to get a room on the marina side, instead of the parking lot side, it was so picturesque and quiet. The first floor on that side is actually way above the water so no need to spend more to get on the 2nd floor either. My only complaint - the pillows. They're the kind that are stuffed with large, lumpy chunks of sponge. Shelter Island is gorgeous and peaceful and, if you have kids, I don't see why you'd want or need to stay in downtown San Diego. You can easily get everywhere - amusement parks, beaches, restaurants because the nearby main road, Rosecrans, takes you to all the major freeways in no time.

Just like the 1st trip, it was excellent in every way. The Hotel is situated on Shelter Island, only a few minutes from downtown San Diego by taking Harbor Drive. Shelter Island is very nautical themed with boat marinas, boat repair shops, restaurants, shopping, banks, parks, fast food, gas stations, groceries stores are all near the Hotel. You can walk across the street and there is a boat launch/ramp right into the water! Lots of green grass areas to picnic on or walk a dog or just lay down and relax. The area of Shelter Island is very mellow and relaxed, not noisy or crowded, its close to downtown San Diego, but far enough away! ** So, upon check in, Jody greeted us with a smile and said \"welcome back!\" and immediately I was impressed. Jody checked us in quickly, gave us a gorgeous 2nd floor room facing the San Diego Bay/Downtown Skyline. The room had a view worth a million bucks! We had a room with 2 queen beds, the room is quite large for a \"standard\" room, nice bathroom area, small fridge, and the balcony is nice to sit out and look at the water and downtown. Beds were comfy and clean. The room was spotless. Very nice decor and well kept. ** Just like before, the staff here is super friendly and is always willing to help or answer questions. The staff in general gets an A+ for a grade. ** Parking is more than ample. Outside spaces as well as underground parking garage that runs the length of Hotel. Never one issue with parking. There is a $5.00/night fee to park now. Not terrible, but last time it was free parking. Overall grade: A ** Breakfast buffet in the morning is excellent. There are 4 HOT bins that have: Sausage/Bacon, Pancakes, Scrambled Eggs (2 kinds), and Breakfast Potatoes. There is also various rolls, muffins, breads, English muffins, cereal, milk, juice, coffee, soda, water, etc. This is a GREAT way to start off the day. And its FREE!! You can sit inside with a view of the marina or sit outside by the pool to eat. Overall grade: A+ ** Pool/Spa area is more than adequate. The pool is medium sized, heated, and usually nobody uses it. We did and it was clean and warm. The Spa/Hot Tub is BIG and HOT!! It will fit about 20 people if needed and was clean and worked perfectly. There are plenty of lounge chairs, table chairs and tables, umbrellas if you so choose. Overall grade: A+ ** Location again is excellent. We got to the Fashion Valley mall in 8 minutes, the San Diego Zoo was about 15 minutes, Gaslamp area was about 15 minutes, USS Midway area is only about 10 minutes away, Coronado Island was about 20 minutes away and is FANTASTIC!! ** The Hotel is older, but very well kept. We had NO issues or problems for our 3 night stay. Heck, I didn't want to leave!! There are 2 floors and I prefer the 2nd floor facing the bay. The marina side is very serene and quiet and you have a panoramic view of the marina and houses on the mountain. We heard a few cars and motorcycles in our room, but nothing that would make me say its noisy. The marina side would be pin-drop-quiet. ** Humphrey's next door has a concert every night. You can watch for FREE from the pool area! The concerts all end at 10pm, so its not rockin' all night. Great place to mix it up and have a few drinks and get a little crazy. You can walk about 100ft back to The Bay Club!! ** There are only 4 hotels on the strip of land where The Bay Club is located. So, there really never was much traffic or too many people. ** Overall grade: A+ I can't wait to go back!! Thank you Alejandra, Jody, Amanda, Steven, and the rest of the staff at The Bay Club Hotel & Marina!! You guys are the BEST!!

If I had to give constructive comments I would note: The room was a little musty, which may have been just because of the close proximity to the water, but also may have been because the carpeting looked a little old. It was a little noisy at times, hearing the shower in the next room, guests in the hall, etc. On the last day of our stay, the shower struggled to stay warm. It was the only day I showered around 9 am, which might have been a popular time. Also, although the breakfast was good with many choices, including eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, oatmeal, etc, it would have been nice to have a little more variety from day to day. We were there for 7 days; pancakes were offered on 5, the fruit was mostly melon, and the cereal was the same fruit loops and raisin bran each day, with raisins also available to put on top.

Yes, the hotel is a bit older but I already expected that. I even expected the great staff. However, I was incredibly pleased to find out that their food was also spectacular. We ended up eating there every night for dinner (happy hour from 4-7 = 1/2 price appetizers!) They were so good and the price was much less than I expected it to be, I expecially recommend the crab cakes and the coconut shrimp. Yes the breakfasts do get a bit boring after a couple of days but it is FREE and HOT, how can you ask for more in San Diego where most hotels charge an arm and a leg for food and parking. Another plus were the guests themselves. We met some wonderful people, it was a mix of those also on vacation and beleive it or not people who were actually living on their boats in the marina. Everyone was friendlly and I expect we will actually visit one of the other couples we met there on another vacation! Now for the room. We have a 7 yr old girl who loves boats and dolphins so we opted to take a risk and stay on the Bay side. If you have a child who likes boats I highly recommend it. Do get a 2nd floor room though, I have a feeling it would be harder to see the boats on the first floor. We saw several Navy ships sail by and at night you can walk on the Bay and hear the seals barking, we even saw them swimming in the water. It was one of our trip highlights - and we didn't even have to leave the area! Once you close the balcony door the noises dissapeared and it was plenty quiet to sleep. Humphries next door even had a concert going on one of the nights and we didn't hear a thing. Long story short - if you want a good hotel with great staff at an even better price, stay at the Bay.

Parking is onsite, and includes a $5. fee, also very reasonable compared to other hotels in the area. We loved the easy access to the walking trails across the street from the hotel that run the length of the bay, and enjoyed watching a huge cargo ship leave the harbor. We opted for dinner in the hotel restaurant, and enjoyed an ample and excellent rib dinner while appreciating the view that overlooks the marina. We returned to the restaurant for the large breakfast in the morning, included in the room price. There is also a bar that offers \"Happy Hour\" drinks and appetizers in the afternoon. While others have mentioned that the decor is perhaps outdated, we enjoyed the \"outrigger\" style, which seems appropriate for the nautical surroundings and was reminiscent of older resort hotels.

I requested and got a room on the second floor facing San Diego Bay. Fortunately the weather was terrific - cool, crisp and sunny. The room as requested came with 2 queen beds - was spacious. The balcony was small but large enough to sit in a chair and read and the view was outstanding. Morning sunrises and evening sunsets. The bathroom was well equipped and spacious. Standard closet, dressers and TV arrangement. But then I was not there to watch TV. The location is excellent - located on a what amounts to a man-made breakwater facing the San Diego bay. I had no problem with noise during my visit, but I will admit the walls are on the thin side. A complete breakfast buffet was included in the price of the room and included everything you could want in a US style breakfast buffet. Parking for my rental car in an underground garage was $5/day additional. However the room price was fantastic for a hotel in San Diego with a view of the bay during a weekend in December. While it is great to take a walk along the bay side of Harbor Island, that is about all there is within easy walking distance of the hotel, so you will need a rental car for sightseeing around San Diego. Above and beyond the call of duty: The morning before I flew home I went to the front desk to see if would be possible for someone to print out my boarding pass at the appropriate time so I would get early boarding.

Check-in went quick and she told me she would send Patrick up right away with the extra amenity I'd purchased.

I should've called the front desk to have someone check it, but I didn't. Also, I would've liked it more had there been video check-out, but I guess since my room wasn't far from the front desk, it was no big deal to have to go there to check-out.

It was easy to find and the position on Shelter Island was very nice indeed - with views over to Coronado from one side of the property and of the marina on the other. However for some reason our three night stay was something of a disappointment and didn't really live up to our expectations. Maybe it had something to do with the lack of attention to detail. The staff were friendly enough - but too often they seemed to simply be going through the motions. Both when we had dinner on our first night and at breakfast on all three mornings there was no real sign of them wanting to impress or going the extra mile. We noticed there was a lot of standing around and chatting - rather than being proactive and anticipating customer needs. We often had to ask for something - then they forgot about it and never sounded overly bothered when we had to ask for a second time. The food at dinner was good but we didn't particularly rate the included breakfast buffet - especially the hot items which didn't really look that appetising. Perhaps it was our fault for coming down to breakfast within the last hour of service - but that shouldn't make any difference. The food should be appetising whatever the service time and maybe it would have been better had it been cooked little and often. Sadly the majority looked like it had been lying around for quite some time - and the cold display was quite sparse and certainly nothing to get excited about. Our room had a marina view from the second floor and was large and quite well equipped. However it didn't smell overly fresh and both the decor and the fixtures and fittings could have done with a bit of TLC - as indeed could many of the public areas for that matter. We also felt that the $5 daily parking fee was rather unnecessary. Presumably this is simply a method of raising additional revenue rather than controlling parking spaces - since the hotel has both a large surface and underground car park and there is also ample free parking directly outside.

The location could not be bettered. Although it is close to the airport the planes never caused us any noise problems. To be honest with the airport in the very centre of the city every hotel is going to be close to the airport, many could be right under the flight path but this is not. I can see a comment from another reviewer who said that the staff are not friendly. Yes we did have to make an effort to speak to them but as soon as you do they are very friendly and helpful. John in the bar was good fun. I think this is better than staff who are over friendly and in your face all the time. Breakfast was included, but was the same almost every day. A self service buffet comprised of a selection from 3 cereals, hot food was choice of scrambled egg, bacon, breakfast potatoes and some kind of waffle, toast, orange juice and tea or coffee. It was a good start to the day but a little boring. The dining room had good views over the marina and you could sit outside near the pool to have breakfast if you wished. With most hotels charging a fortune for breakfast we found this a good way to save a little money. Our room ( number 142) was on the ground floor. The hotel is only 2 or maybe 3 floors and I would recommend that you take a room on the upper floor, not only for the great views over the marina or sea front road (if you take that side of the hotel) but also we had a family above us for a couple of days who allowed their kids to stomp around the room and the noise was terrible for those two days. The room was spacious and well equipped, including a fridge to store your own drinks etc. There were loads of TV channels to choose from including sports channels, all on a giant LCD TV. The bathroom had a small bath with shower over. Only problems we had in the room were, the air con was old fashioned and although it worked it was very noisy so could not be left on overnight so the room did get very hot, also there were ants. We left a cake that we had bought from Town out, sealed in its box overnight on the top of the chest of drawers and in the morning it was covered with ants who were taking the cake apart and carrying it away down the legs of the chest and disappearing under the floor. There was a free to use computer for internet in the lobby, which was useful for checking flights etc or getting more details of the area. $5 a day for parking is a lot less than most other hotels in the area and when you take into account the cost of the staying at this hotel and that breakfast is included we thought it OK. Altogether we thought the hotel good value and would stay there again. Just a few notes on San Diego, you need to hire a car, do not visit Sea World especially if you have been to the one in Florida as its very poor and very expensive to get in. Do visit Point Loma for the views.

We wanted to be closer to the airport, and also wanted to try out a new location in San Diego. I booked the Hawaiian package - I can't remember exactly what it was called, but it included two free drinks in the lounge, and a welcome platter of fruit and cookies, and parking was also included in the price. We didn't get the free drinks because the lounge closed early and we didn't make it in time. The platter was delivered just as we were heading to the room after check-in, by the same lady that checked us in. Check in service was excellent, the lady was very friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and bright, but smelled kind of old and musty. It was pretty old, old carpets, old carpets in the hallway, had the wood 70's look to it. There is a small bar area with a fridge and counter and sink, where the coffee maker is. The bathroom was clean and functional, but lighting was quite dim, the fan made a lot of noise, and again it was pretty old. We had a room with two queen beds. The view from the balcony was very nice, you can see the water (we had a bay view), the patio window was old and rickety, and the balcony was also old. We parked outside just below our balcony (we were on the second floor). It did look and feel like a Polynesian theme, it reminded me of the old apartment time share units in Waikiki, same era (only well kept compared to the ones in Waikiki). The lady at the front desk recommended a restaurant nearby, she said it was a 20 minute walk but it certainly was not, we walked 20 minutes and were in the middle of nowhere, then decided to go back and get the car - it was definitely a short drive, though. The surrounding area was very nice, we went for a walk along the path by the water, walked onto a pier where a few people were fishing, played in the playground nearby, watched some birds. It's a beautiful, relaxing area - not much around other than that, though. It's definitely a marina place, you drive through a lot of boat related businesses before you get to the hotels by the water. The walls are thin - there was a baby crying in the next room and it kept me up until late and then woke me up early in the morning. Luckily my kids and husband are heavy sleepers and manage to sleep right through it. I'm not a light sleeper, either, but it woke me up. We went down to the free breakfast, and yes, there are hot choices, and we did manage to eat something, but it wasn't very good. I had to ask for a coffee refill a few times before I got one. The servers looked rushed and harried even though it was a buffet and \"seat yourself\" style service. They still had to clear the tables and serve drinks. Overall I would say it was a pleasant stay, I wasn't expecting the Hilton or anything like that, so it met my expectations - I would suggest they upgrade the place a bit, though. It was fine for a one night stay, I probably wouldn't spend the week there, and I would probably not stay there again - now that we've tried the Shelter Island area, it's nice, but there's not much around, there are better locations to stay as a home base in San Diego. If I were to stay in that area again, I'd probably try the other, newer hotels nearby. It was okay value for what I paid, I think that I could have found a nicer place cheaper but it was probably more costly due to its proximity to the water.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cConvenient\u201d", "Author": "KimD2009", "ReviewID": "UR119056332", "Content": "We (My husband 2 teenage sons and I) recently stayed at the Bay Club for 3 nights while visiting San Diego.

Gave me the rooms that I reserved online in the middle of Bay and Marina, right in front on other hotels garbage area, I have pictures, when I went back, they said internet reservations guarantees for second floor, not a view. I was shocked to hear that. My confirmation said \u201cBAY VIEW\u201d, so their site. Even though they changed the rooms next day, I'm sure he did it purposely, cause I confronted him that \u201cwhile you said double beds are sold out, I found out there was at least 4 more\u201d. Be careful especially if you\u2019re talking to Aaron. Other big problem, I reserved for dinner 16 people for following evening, unfortunately 3 or 4 people ate at a time, like they serve food for 3, then wait 10 min. then food for 4, then another 10 min. It is very simple. If you can't serve for 16, don't accept the reservation. Imagine those who ate at first, were done eating and still there were 3 people without food, still waiting. And when we asked for manager the lady at the bar got very nasty, we just wanted to leave the nasty environment.

The hotel has a nice restaurant area, an outdoor pool and hot tub, large HD television in the room, free wi-fi and complimentary buffet breakfast. Also there is a refrigerator in the room, but no microwave. The location is on Shelter Island and one side of the hotel faces the Marina and the other side faces a public boat launch and beach on San Diego Bay. It only has two floors and the rooms on the second floor have the best view. On the downside, our reservation was for a Bay View room with 2 double beds. We did not get our room request despite the fact that we made our reservation 3 months in advance. The room we got had one queen bed and was on the second floor with a Marina view. The view was nice, but we would have preferred to at least have the 2 double beds that we wanted. Also, on arriving, our room was really hot and the air conditioner was not working properly. We asked to be moved to another room and were told that the hotel was full. They said they would send someone up to look at it, and when we came back to the room later, someone had been there, but it still was not working. After several days, the outdoor temp had risen to 85 and the room was very uncomfortable, so I called again complaining about the air conditioner. They wanted to send someone up again and I said that it was not fixed the last time and insisted that they move us to another room. At this point they did let us move to a Bay View room. It still had the queen bed, but at least the air conditioner worked. Also we felt that the beds and pillows were not very comfortable compared to other hotels we have stayed in. On the plus side, they do have a buffet breakfast every day which consisted of eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, oatmeal, english muffins, fruit, toast and some cold cereals. The entire week was basically the same menu, except one day they added pancakes and one day waffles. I would suggest that they should include some low fat yogurt and more fruit choices. The breakfast is supposed to be self-serve, but they have waitresses that keep wanting to refill your coffee and juice and then they put a ticket on your table expecting a tip which was rather annoying. Also, they do charge $5 a day for parking, which I think should be free when you are paying a good price for a hotel room. But we figured that the complimentary breakfast everyday somewhat offset the parking charge. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay there, despite the air conditioner problem. The hotel has a nice location, the food was decent, and it is not far from the airport or the downtown area.

First, let me say that I am very picky when it comes to hotels! The Bay Club Hotel and Marina is a great choice hands down! The Bay Club was my choice after a few weeks spent researching hotels in San Diego. This was my third trip to the area and I wanted to try something new. When I first saw the photo's I thought that perhaps the hotel may be a little dated and some of the reviews made me think that might be the case. However, the overwhelming comments about how clean it was and how great the staff was (not to mention the ranking number) helped me make my decision. I couldn't have made a better choice. The staff is just great. The parking is only $5.00 per day; the rooms are clean, VERY quiet and the location is great. It is minutes from the airport, downtown and a short drive to La Jolla. They staff is great about giving you directions and recommendations for the area. I was amazed that a large bottle of water from the gift store was only $1.50. In any other hotel it would have cost much more. The breakfast in the morning was nice and again, the staff wonderful. I did tip the servers and they deserve it. I was surprised to see some comments about not leaving a tip; come on people, after all, for the great rate AND free breakfast why would anyone opt NOT to? If anyone would dare be able to afford a vacation and not leave at least a few dollars then shame on you! Read the book Nickeled and Dimed in America and then think twice about such decisions. I digress; take it from someone who takes her time making hotel selections and someone who searches for the best value and clean, nicely appointed rooms; this is a great choice. The decor is island decor but the bedspreads are some of the cleanest I have seen; better than some of the \"upscale\" hotels I have stayed in.

There are about 4 warm breakfast offerings each day along with fresh fruit, coffee, juice cereal and toast. They give you a receipt at breakfast to sign and fill in a tip amount if you choose to do so. We didn't sign it 2 out of the 3 mornings we were there. The room was really large and the bed super comfortable. We had an issue with our shower that was completely resolved within 20+ minutes time from when we telephoned the front desk. I recommend parking in the below ground parking because the spaces up top are too narrow. Parking was an additional $5.00 per day. The hotel is located 5 minutes from the airport but you don't hear the noise. There is a fitness center that seemed to be a secret and there was a computer and printer in the lobby where you can print your airplane boarding passes. A real nice restaurant at the end of Shelter Island is Bali Hai. The view of San Diego fantastic and it's a beautiful setting with great food. Also, we went to see the Mets play the Padres at Petco Stadium. You can get really premium seats for really cheap (according to New York standards) or pay as little as $10 to sit and watch the game.

We can't say enough about how friendly and efficient the staff at this hotel are. Their great service started when our plane arrived late into San Diego, shortly after 11PM, meaning we\u2019d missed the last shuttle the hotel offers. We phoned the hotel from the airport and the shuttle driver \"Aaron\" was kind enough to put an extra 1/2 hour on the clock to come pick us up. How nice is that? We were given a beautiful Marina view room with a very comfortable king-sized bed. Each room facing the marina has its own balcony so you can sit outside and enjoy the serene view of the boats before you. We've never stayed on the Bay side of the hotel, but it looks to offer another great view of the Bay and all the activities therein. You really can't go wrong staying on either side of the hotel, we just felt the marina side might be a little quieter. The room was very clean, had a Big Screen TV, plenty of channels on the Cable (which we appreciated for the Stanley Cup Playoffs - we're Canadian, eh?), and a small fridge. If there was one fault we could find, and it's minor, it would be that the bathroom could use a little updating, other than that we had absolutely no complaints about our room. The staff are beyond courteous. Each morning they have a delicious and substantial breakfast buffet and our waiter \"Raul\" was top-notch in his friendly and efficient service. You might be lucky enough to see \"Steven Seagull\" peering through the window as you're dining on breakfast. This bird and his wife \"Rita\" have become friends with Raul and are often seen waiting by the window hoping for an extra food-treat to come their way. One guest went so far as to write a heart-warming short story on the bird\u2019s relationship with Raul. You'll find the story located in the gift shop at the hotel,\u201d Steven\u2019s Story\", it's a delightful read! You couldn't have a better location than to stay on Shelter Island. The walkway by the ocean is gorgeous, and the hotel is central to every place you'd want to go in San Diego. We rented a vehicle, and there again we recieved great service when our hotel shuttle driver \"Patrick\" was kind enough to drive us to the car rental location. Before leaving the hotel and taking a flight back home the Front Desk Manager \"Tim\" suggested they could print our Boarding Passes for us to make the departure that much quicker. Just another \"perk\" to staying at this great hotel! We will definitely return to this hotel, and would highly recommend it to all!

The decor could use a little updating but I'm not there to stare at the room. The bed was comfortable. We had a nice little balcony facing the marina. We stayed on the bottom floor. The one problem I had with the place, which I didn't mention to the staff, was I think the ceilings are thin. There must have been a family which had small children in the room above us that kept running back and forth. It was loud. I think even when they were just walking normally (or they just naturally stomp around) we could hear each step. Word to the wise, tread lightly if staying on the top floor, or stay on the top if you don't want to hear people walking above you. The continental breakfast sufficed. It wasn't excellent but it wasn't terrible. The staff treat you well there. They help serve you, set the tables for you, get your drinks. I was a little surprised when they handed me a receipt to sign, so we included a tip. i've not had that done at any other continental breakfasts in other hotels, but they do serve you more than at another place. Decently located. Easy to find. Nice area across the way to just walk along the water. The fee was good. I was able to get a lower price calling the hotel directly than the fees I saw on travel websites. I would stay there again, if I was in that area again, but I probably wouldn't just because I'd like to try something different.

It's a 12 minute walk to the bus stop, & restaurants within 10-15 min walking distance. We didn't have a car so it was good to be able to walk to the bus--with some pre-planning (see MTS website) we could get to most tourist sites within an hour, like Mission Beach, Sea world & Balboa Park. The front desk will give you a handy bus guide if you ask for it. Breakfast was plentiful & the staff were always very nice to give us a box to pack some snacks for the kids. While there is a tip form, it is not expected. We also appreciated the no-alcohol policy at the pool & hot tub since we have small kids. Small details would have made it a 5* for us. Minor updating (i.e. the carpet in the public areas, update the dim lighting in the hallways) would make a big difference. It didn't bother us, as the rooms themselves were very clean & nice, but don't expect a brand-new glitzy lobby. The restaurant has good food but nothing fancy. Make sure you know where the shuttle stop is downtown to get a ride back, if you decide to use the hotel's shuttle service (it's $5 to go downtown but free to airport) - its by Old Town Trolley station near the Flagship/Hornblower cruises.

We did however appreciate the shuttle to the cruise terminal the following morning, took maybe 10 minutes.

We could also hear the TV in the next room, they did have it turned quite loud until the wee hours but we were so tired from travelling that we were able to sleep through it. I think if I stayed here again I would suggest a Marina view room. The room itself was clean and spacious, a little worn. We found the beds soft, the kind you end up both rolling into the middle by morning, but at least they were clean. Nice hot buffet breakfast with everything you could think of was included in the morning. A little tacky that the staff cleaning the tables and bringing your drink (which could have been on the buffet to begin with) handed you a pen & paper to fill out an additional tip, I've just never had that at a comp. self-serve buffet before.

Twenty minutes later the music started again and when I called reception they told me that everyone had vacated the room. I told them that they had to come up again as there sounded as if there were 40 people in the room. He did come up and there were that many people in the room.

Having internet access is very important to our family (all 4 of us brought our laptops) and not having internet access during our stay at this hotel was a bummer. If having the internet in your hotel room is important, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. We stayed in 6 different hotels during our 2 week visit out west, and this hotel was the only one with terrible internet access (and the hotel we paid the most to stay in).", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in a beautiful location.\u201d", "Author": "Russellicious", "ReviewID": "UR65965446", "Content": "I stayed here for one night this past week with my girlfriend.

As with most people who use this sight A and C played the most important role. We were very happy with the accommodations. Our room was large and clean; considerably larger in fact then the standard hotel room. Because the reviews are so positive it did catch us a little by surprise how old this hotel is. It had a bit of a musty odor when we first walked in but it wasn't serious and everything is maintained well. A big benefit for us was the full breakfast offered each day. During all our stay, the staff were friendly and helpful. We were specially impressed by the service during breakfast. The location as mentioned in many other reviews is excellent for walking along the harbor and watching all manor of boats including large military vessels and cruise ships. It should be noted however that the area around this hotel is relatively industrial. There are other hotels close by and several restaurants, but the main road is populated with marina entrances, yacht brokers, boat storage yards and other assorted commercial enterprises. Maybe it was because we were then in January but while walking the main road at night, it was pretty much dead. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel.

We stayed at this hotel based on the reviews here and were not disappointed. The views and location on the Bay are excellent. We were looking to stay here rather than in town for the Bay views. We had a car so this was not a problem but the only small issue is that the actual town centre of San Diego is a few miles away so it is not within walking distance. This hotel is situated in a part of the bay called Point Loma which is very lively with lots of boats, restaurants, bars etc. There are lots of shops within 2-3 mins drive on the main road so Walgreens etc not far. Lots of choice for restaurants too only a couple of minutes drive away. As for the room, it was very spacious and very clean. We had a marina view room which was great and we were on the 2nd floor so a better view than the 1st floor. Our only small issue with this hotel was that free wifi is provided as part of your stay, but although were had a router almost right outside our room the signal was very weak. We were provided a bridge to use which picks up the signal and then you can plug your laptop into this which works fine, but not really wifi then is it :) Lucky for us we both work in IT and managed to set up one laptop with the bridge then share out the wifi through that so we could use our iphones! This will not be the case for every guest being able to know how to do this so if you really want the wifi for more than 1 device or to use your phone (iphone, Blackberry etc) I would recommend confirming with the hotel that you can get a decent signal in the room you will be staying in :) Altogether I would rate this hotel as a very good 3 star/maybe 4 star. There was a restaurant but we didnt eat here except for breakfast which is of a buffet style and not too bad a selection of food. We would definately stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice hotel by the Bay. Last point, there is a place called Phils BBQ and Grill 5 mins drive away and it is great.

We could even watch military jets take off from our room. Shelter Island is a handy location away from the city, close to the airport with a wonderful path for walking, or jogging. We had a view of city and a beautiful view of the bay at the same time. It is also a short ride to Point Loma and the lighthouse, a park not to be missed. The hotel was so clean anywhere you looked and the people at the desk extremely helpful. The breakfast was good and the dinner in the restaurant was delicious. We asked for more towels and were given lots. The in and out ease of being in a 2 story hotel was so much more comfortable than always grabbing an elevator in a high rise. It is not a modern high rise and to me that is the charm of the place. We were not charged for parking which was easy in their lot or in the well lit parking garage underneath, we used both. Being by the water was great! The very first night the woman at the desk suggested we take a walk on the path down to the pier and we saw pelicans and a seal right from where we were standing.

Raul and Jerry always made sure our coffee and juice was full and Raul even remembered us and gave us our \"favorite\" table. We only stayed for four nights and wished our stay was longer. We loved the location vs. where my sister-in-law stayed (Bahia resort). Her area was busy where our area was nice and calm even though there is a park across the street. It's also not too far from other places to go eat. From the hotel, turn right onto Rosecrans. You will find stores and places to eat and if you continue to Sports Arena Blvd. and turn left, you will have Target, Chili's, Baker's Square. It's because of the hotel staff we learned that. We checked in close to 10pm on a Wednesday night and they were nice enough to look up where the nearest Chili's was so we can get a bite to eat. We liked the fact that the sink/vanity area was outside of the toilet/shower area so that the two of us can get ready separately to save time. The bed was comfortable. The only \"complaint\" was they didn't have your normal fitted mattress protector (just a flat padding) under the fitted sheet and when you roll over, the corners would pop off which was a little frustrating but not a deal breaker.

We found we liked being tucked away at the end of the 'little hallway' because we did not get a bunch of passing foot traffic from other guests.

Our room wasn't ready when we got there as we did arrive before the check in time but the staff we're very helpfull and stored our bags for us untill the room was ready and showed us were the bar and other facilities were and recommended things to do while we waited.

When we got to the room we couldnt believe how spacious it was, we was on the second floor with a balcony with lovely views. The food is out of this world with a variety to suit everyone my compliments go to the chef at this hotel, my partner is quite a fussy eater but they were more then happy to change things slightly to suit his needs. The buffet breakfast was lovely i couldnt believe the variety of food that was available in some hotels its sometimes a very basic breakfast but they seemed to have everything. The staff are very friendly and took the time to chat to us which made us feel more at home and relaxed and they were more then happy to help us with our needs. What made this holiday really special for me is that my partner also proposed whilst we was out there. The staff members all went out of there way to help him get what he needed and to also keep me out of the way, they helped to make the day very special. I would 100% recommend having a massage whilst your there it was out of this world. i had a full hour massage from head to toe and i felt so relaxed afterwards its the best i've had and compared to the prices in England i thought it was a great price. I've never been to a hotel were the staff are so friendly and helpfull and all the other guests were firendly and all loooked like they were having a great time we did not hear one complaint whilst we were there. I will recommend that if your planning at staying here the hotel offer a free shuttle that will collect you and return you to the airport just give them a call when your at the airport and the shuttle bus will collect you and it saves spending around $20 on a cab ride. What was also great about the hotel was that it was in the middle of San Diego Zoo and Sea world as we wasnt driving it made it easier to get a cab to each one and it wasnt too expensive. i would just like to take this opportunity to thank Laurie, Tammy, and everyone at the hotel for making us feel so welcome we will without a doubt be returning.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great service\u201d", "Author": "CaptDad42", "ReviewID": "UR20417361", "Content": "We just returned from the Bay Club Hotel after spending four nights there.

The in-room air conditioning units are loud and rattly, but the room was too stuffy without it. If you open the windows you will be awoken by traffic noise and smoke wafting into your room. The bathroom has a weak fluorescent bulb that buzzes. It's like being in a cheap roadside motel. The pool looked nice, but my child noted the mildew growing on the sauna wall, and my other child came down with an ear infection later that week. They said it didn't seem to have any chlorine.

The front desk staff -- especially Alejandra, Allison, and Gatia -- were incredibly accomodating. They gave us maps to tourist attractions, changed $3 into quarters for meters, made suggestions for insider places to go, printed our boarding passes, and always had a pleasant word and a smile. They were never too busy to help us. 3. A really good buffet breakfast was included in the room cost, and the servers -- Raul and Jerry -- were always ready with coffee and juice and clearing of plates. They made the meal relaxing. 4. Parking is only $5 a night. 5. The location -- on Shelter Island -- requires a rental car, but it's a quiet location out of the city. On one side is the Bay and a small park. Great for an evening walk. On the other side is a beautiful marina with thousands of boats. Yes, thousands.. By car, you're downtown in about ten minutes, and it's a straight shot. 6. The hotel next door has outdoor concerts. While some previous reviewers complained, we couldn't have been happier. From our pool area, you could see into the concert shed and we had no trouble hearing the concert. In the week we were there, we enjoyed concerts by the Doobie Brothers, Frankie Valli, and Ringo Starr. 7. The pool and hot tub were very well maintained and relaxing.

My overall rating is around 3.5 stars; 2. The location is excellent--easy access to airport and all touristie activities; 3. The location is quiet other than the Humphrey Hotel next door--don't plan on going to sleep until 11pm on some nights (loud music); 4. Even though the hotel is dated, that should not stop you from staying there; 5. We stayed on the 2nd floor with a marina view and balcony--you want this view (very relaxing); 6. Our room had two queens--the mattresses are very firm but the pillows have a lot to be desired; 7. The room itself is like your average hotel rooms; 8. They call their rooms air condition, I call them swamp cooler air conditon--if you're a light sleeper, they could be a bit noisy. 9. The hotel is smoke free, however, you do have your smokers on the balcony and down by the pool side; 10. There maid service is excellent--please tip them they do earn it; 11. The pool and spa is Ok; 12. There free morning breakfast is nothing to crow about--it's not your Embassy Suites breakfast meals though;13. The breakfast is premade for you to dish up--scrambled eggs, french toast or hot cakes, sausage and bacon, cold ceral, fruit, breads, muffins, and pastries--the coffee is OK; 14. Hotel staff was good; 15. Would I stay here again--yes but not during the summer--I think you can get better deals at nearby hotels for the same fees.

Depending on which end of the building you stay on, you can hear (and even see) the performers from your balcony - so don't expect quiet before 10PM. On the flip side - you can get a free concert!

The other room would be ready around 3 pm. They took my cell number and said they would call when it was ready. We took all our bags to the room that was ready and had lunch at the hotel. The lunch was very good and no more expensive than your typical restaurant. Later we took a walk out to the grass area on the Bay side of the hotel. Excellent views.

The hotel is right on shelter island which is a man-made island in San Diego. Every room has a view of either the marina or the bay. I paid for a premium harbor view room with two queen beds at $169 a night (note that this was the memorial day weekend). I was there with my wife and two little kids. The service at this place was par excellence, from the time we booked the hotel by phone. We checked in little late at 7:00 pm even though the check-in time was 3:30 pm but we called the hotel and they promised to keep our room and not to worry. Once we checked in, I was a bit disappointed by the view since my room was on the right half of the hotel and had less of the downtown view (but it still had a nice view of the bay). I asked the lady at the front desk if she could change our room to the other half of the building for a better view. She said she did not have anything right away but immediately told me that she could move us into another room the very next day. All we had to do was pack our bags and leave them in the room and they would take care of it. Sure enough, after we came back from the Zoo the next day, our bags were moved to another room with a better view of downtown and the bay. No problems whatsoever. The room itself was clean and well kept. Yes, it looked a bit worn out and linens were not very new. The tub in our second room did not drain very well but this was fixed the very next day without us complaining. There were also problems with the tap in the tub leaking a bit. But the decent size of the room and view made up for these shortcomings. The rooms come with complimentary breakfast which is in the restaurant right opposite the lobby with a nice view of the marina. The breakfast itself starts at 6:00 am and lasts till 10:00 am. We had breakfast for three morning there and no matter time what time we went, the food was always hot and no item was gone. And the waiters made sure that our coffee and juice cups were always full. Every single person behind the welcome desk was very courteous and friendly. When I wanted a suggestion for a nice family friendly place to go to for dinner on my birthday, the folks there suggested two or three different local places. We ended up at Pizza Nova which also had nice views of the marina. And you should try their Gorgonzola with Pear pizza. It was out of this world. There is access to the beach right across the street from this hotel. You can see early morning joggers strolling across this beach with their dogs. There were some benches that you could sit to watch sunrise of sunset or just enjoy the view. The place is also very close to downtown and there were many small restaurants around this hotel The only slight issue that I had at this place had nothing to do with the hotel itself. There is a naval training base of some sort right on the other side of this island. And there were some F-18's that took off in the middle of the night. I woke up with a shudder thinking that I was in the middle of the earthquake. However, this happened only one night. There were a lot more planes and helicopters flying around all morning. But my kids loved watching the planes and the helis. Overall, we enjoyed out stay in this hotel. It was a bit pricey but you dont get anything for less in San Diego.

This hotel was/is a fave of my mothers..she has been coming here for years with my dad. We treated each other to a 'memory-making' trip. Even tho dad wasn't with us, she was able to relive her special times here. We were pleasantly surprised as to its proximity to the Airport..only 2-3 miles away. We stayed on the second floor..(worth the upgrade) facing the harbour on the westside. We avoided the smoke from the beach fires that seemed to pop up on the beach across the street when the locals showed up...and the jet aircraft noice..and the street noise of traffic and the after hours crowd at Humphreys. We were close to all the points of interest..driving to Point Loma was very easy..going the other way..we drove to the Maritime Museum downtown...very easy to get to. Tickets $12 for adults and $9 for seniors. Our favourite excursion was the Whale Watching Tour with the Hornblower Boat Co. This was well worth the money! We took the 1:30 cruise and saw 4-5 whales breaching the surface and water 'geysering' out of their blowholes. Many dolphins and even saw large white jellyfish! Great for landlubbers like ourselves! The hotel's breakfast was PLENTY to get our day started each morning. We got to know our waiter \"Luis\" who has written a story about the three very special seagulls that arrive each morning to entertain the breakfast guests: \"Nancy\", \"Tilda,\" etc. they all have names! Luis has been feeding them for 15 years and now they are somewhat trained, much to the delight of the children. For those of us who are kids-at-heart..we enjoyed this extra-special touch of human and animal poignancy. Luis needs to have a write-up about him in the daily news..I hope you will enjoy meeting him too. Our room was just the perfect size for the three of us. The room could use an updating, but everything seemed okay. We didn't spend much time in the room. We used the balcony to watch the boats come in-and-out each day. The ship traffic is marvelous. The U.S.S. Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier came into port! What a thrill to see a nuclear powered carrier!!!! Kids will love this hotel and all that there is to do. Whether it is walking the harbour 'seawalk' across the street, or just watching boats from your own balcony/lanai. The Navy was out with a small craft training dolphins one day...right out in front of the hotel! If you don't know what you are seeing, ask a local--they are all out doing their daily walks on the harbour front walk there across the street from The Bay Club. The San Diego Zoo is a must! This was a very satisfying trip. If we ever visit San Diego again, we will re-book our stay at The Bay Club again! Definately !

An advantage to overlooking the bay would be seeing the large naval ships that come in; while outside we saw a cruise ship sail past one night. Reviews are correct in that it is an older property. The carpet is stained in the hallways from what looks like a leaky sprinkler system. It was hard getting past that first impression. The restaurant was very nice. It's been remodeled due to a fire late last fall. The morning breakfast that comes with the rental of the room was excellent with a large variety. They have a 4:00-7:00 social hour with crackers and cheese ONLY with a purchase of a drink at the bar! The rooms are clean. The bathroom tile is a terra cotta brown and the grout was stained in all three rooms we checked. I thought it might be from the humidity in the shower, but even the grout around the tile near the sink area is stained. I noticed the grout in the bathroom near the lobby was also stained. Not a good first impression. Staying at the Bay Club is hard if you don't rent a car. It's surrounded only by other hotels and marinas. After being out and about all day, it would have been nice to come back to our room, clean up and go back out for the evening. There wasn't anywhere to go from the Bay Club within walking distance in the evening except another hotel restaurant. We did get to know the bus system which goes to Shelter Island, which was still a bit of a walk. We had to transfer several times, depending where we wanted to go. We did take advantage of the hotel shuttle, but we were told over and over they usually only do airport shuttles, and because this was their slow time, they would acommodate us. They only want to shuttle you to Seaport Village. We wanted to go the same distance in a different direction one day, and were told they couldn't do it. It also depended on who you talked to at the front desk. Some were more friendly and accomodating than others. We felt we were pestering the shuttle drivers to drop us places. If done again, we would have stayed somewhere close to downtown where we could make a stop at our hotel if we wanted. Staying somewhere near Seaport Village where there's a lot of shops and is close to the Gas Lamp District, which was FULL of restaurants and evening activity! We felt a little slighted that we were there in March and not their busy season in June- August. The tours you read about are geared for those months. Not everything is available during their off season. We had our Hollywood tour cancel the night before because they only had 6 people instead of the 10 or more they required for a 15 passanger vehicle. This was a $100 a person tour. Hard to believe that they're not making a profit on $600. Maybe if they'd run the tour, the word of mouth advertising would be enough to get more people to go.

The hotel is conveniently close to San Diego's Lindbergh Field Airport, but far enough away to avoid jet noise. The hotel is very convenient to Old Town and also to Downtown, but it also seems far-removed from all the crowds. It is also conveniently located near Point Cabrillo and Cabrillo National Monument. We stayed in a Marina view room, upper level with king bed, and we got a very good AAA rate of $159 by contacting the hotel directly. It might be helpful to describe the hotel's setting. I didn't quite understand it before I checked in, but was fortunate to have followed the advice of others in selecting a marina view room. This hotel (and others along Shelter Island Drive like Humphrey's) occupies a relatively thin strip of land with the marina on one side and Shelter Island Drive on the other. The so-called bay view rooms have a distant view of San Diego, a closer view of San Diego Bay; but they have a VERY close view of the hotel's parking lot, Shelter Island Drive, and the municipal parking lot on the other side of Shelter Island Drive. So, while some travelers may like the \"bay view\" rooms, my advice is choose the marina view. You can look out from your balcony over a beautiful marina (Marina View)or over a parking lot and/or busy road (Bay View). The hotel's breakfast buffet was the best of any hotel on our trip. It included eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes or french toast, pastries, bagels, fresh fruit, coffee, tea and juices. The great breakfast really spoiled us for the rest of the trip, as did the beautiful view from our balcony. Hotel management and staff were exceptional.

In fact, we ended up parking on-street a few nights due to the hotel's lot being full. Overall, this is a charming place to stay, and we would visit again. You get a good value for your money and could do better (the Kona Kai Resort and Spa a little bit down looked nice) but also could do a lot worse.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cConvenient, quiet, relaxed and just plain easy\u201d", "Author": "chinchinchin", "ReviewID": "UR8505399", "Content": "We chose this hotel after reading several reviews...and hoping that it's location would lend itself to an older quieter client\u00e8le. We were very pleased! There were no rowdy families with hyper kids ready to attack Sea World or the zoo. No motor coaches full of teenagers. No big parking hassle. Just a casual gracious feel to the place. Lovely safe area to go for a walk, jog or birdwatch. We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 nights at the Bay Club. The service was excellent and the complementary breakfast outstanding. Not only is it a full hot breakfast, but the friendly staff even bring your coffee or tea to your table as they politely leave a slip for your tip. The hotel is small enough that the staff remember you and anticipate your needs. And their attentive and helpful service is well worth a tip! The room was lovely and quiet. So quiet that from our bed, we could not hear each other using the shower. We faced the marina and enjoyed our balcony observing all the comings and goings of the yachting crowd. It was comforting to know that most of the evening there is a guard watching our car in the lot (preventing the concert crowd from parking in there.) I never heard any noise from Humphrey's concerts.

We made the reservation back in May. We chose it because we were planning on attending a show at Humphrey's on the 16th and the rates were far better. It is literally right next door to Humphrey's and was a quick 2 minute walk across the parking lot to the show. No traffic or parking hassles. I had booked a premium queen room. When we checked in they upgraded us to a 1 bedroom suite called the Captain's Quarters. The rooms were open, airy and had wrap around windows with a stunning marina view. The balcony was huge, and wrapped around the whole unit. It had a table and 4 tables and was directly over the water. We sat out there on our second night and listened to the concert at Humphrey's for free. You can hear any show there just like you were in the venue itself. Once you go in and close the door though it's nice and quiet. The bed was super comfortable AND had a fitted bottom sheet. It's a pet peeve of mine, using a regular top sheet for a bottom sheet. Those always end up bunched up underneath me each time I roll over. The pillows were thick and perfect. The living room was huge with chairs and a comfortable couch and coffee table. The bathroom is 2 separate sections, with the sinks and mini fridge in one part and the bath/shower and toilet in the other. Both are in an area that can be closed off behind doors so an early riser can shower and get ready and not wake up a later sleeper. The room is very clean and comfortable and the staff was super helpful and friendly. The breakfast is free and while better then most free ones, the options are pretty limited. We also noticed that bottled beers at bar and soft drinks in the gift shop was not very cold. This could be because it was 85+ all 3 days we were there which is rare for downtown areas by the water. Onsite parking is only $5. Which is amazing! Hotels in San Diego (We live here and play tourist a lot! :) ) on average are $22-$25 per night for parking. $5 a night is just not found. You can park underground in a spacious lot or up top in the smaller lot in front of the hotel.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheyenne, WY", "Title": "\u201cBay Club was Awesome!\u201d", "Author": "WYLam", "ReviewID": "UR8109419", "Content": "We just returned from a nine day stay at the Bay Club and we had a great time.

I booked at the Bay Club with some trepidation after reading the mixed reviews on this site, but our experience there was very nice. We booked one of the executive suites on the second floor. The room was the largest of all the hotels we stayed in on our two-week trip. Our room was located directly above the dining area, and we had a nice view of the marina from the balconies. We watched the fireworks over SeaWorld in the distance on our second night there, and then were treated to the sounds of the Lonestar concert from next door later that night. But that was only on the balcony - you couldn't hear the concert once you closed the sliding doors. The breakfasts were nice and varied. They may not have been the gourmet buffets you will get at one of the hotels downtown, but they were much better than the simple fare you will get at many of the outlying hotels. I have stayed at a number of different San Diego locations over the years (my company has a conference out there every other year). This hotel is located in an area that's much less hectic than downtown, Mission Beach or Hotel Circle, but I didn't really notice an appreciable increase in the amount of time it took to get anywhere. As far as negatives for the hotel, the only one we experienced was the sofa bed, which was pretty bad. My teenage son was much more comfortable sleeping on the cushions on the floor than my daughter was in the bed. I can see how rooms on the first floor facing the street can get poor reviews, since you have people parking their cars right at your window. Definitely upgrade to a marina view room.", "Date": "June 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cAwesome place but ditch the Security guard!\u201d", "Author": "NurseMom115", "ReviewID": "UR7731466", "Content": "Check in was quick and easy. We stayed here 4 nights while in town for my best friends wedding. They graciously extended the wedding rate for our entire stay which was nice. Rooms are immaculate. A little dated, but spotless! Plently of clean towels and extra pillows. Room was cleaned daily and sheets changed. The breakfast is AWESOME and TRUST ME...it is a FULL BREAKFAST. Some of the other reviews complain about the breakfast and it is very good, lots of variety. Ask for Jerry or Tom as a server because they are exxcellent and kept the coffee flowing. Jerry went out of his way to recommend some hot spots in the area and they all panned out to be great. The views are lovely and the area is beautiful. The pool and spa are great and we enjoyed a free concert by Boyz To Men who were performing next door at Humphreys. Plenty of parkinvg and reasonably priced too. I do believe that the 2nd floor is the place to be...my ONLY COMPLAINT was the wanna-be-cop Security Guard who really thinks he is Gods personal gift...NOT! Apparently, the people below us complained that my kids were being noisy and he showed up at the door like Rambo. We put the kiddies to bed and about 2 hours later, he called and woke us all up being obnoxious and threatening us that he has been up to our room once already and the noise better cease. My hubby explained that he is being misinformed as our entire family was sleeping. He continued on that this was his final warning. I immediately went down to the desk and demanded an explanation. He overheard me speaking to the guy at the front desk and came over and rudely interupted the young man behind the desk. He continued on that he did not mean to sound threatening but when other guests complain, etc. etc. I boldly pointed out that he was not threatening me in the least and the phone calls to my room had better stop as my family is sleeping and to take his wanna-be investigation elsewhere. He started babbling about his authority and I walked away. The next morning on our way to breakfast, the people in the room below us were leaving and my hubby approached them regarding their complaint. The man and woman said they could hear our TV and the kids runnning around the room. But they insisted they only called the desk once and the noise stopped. So Mr. Tough Guy Security Guard made the 2nd call up completely...which we knew anyway since we are all sleeping. My hubby also pointed out to the couple that it was not necessary to call the front desk at 8pm! But whatever. Upon check out the girl at the desk said they were high maintenance customers who complained about everything and ended up attempting to get their rate reduced...so it turned out they were con-artists. Regardless, the security guard is unprofessional in my book.

Check in - Arrived at 4pm for check in and were given room 245, we were'nt directed to it and had to ask where the elevator was! Room: On entering the room it was small but clean, then we saw the balcony - tiny! One chair, we were not happy (we had upgraded to deluxe as we wanted a balcony and we wanted to avoid the noise issue as discussed on previous posts). We returned to reception requesting another room - the front desk was very reluctant saying they were full but she eventually said room 251 was still being cleaned and sent us up to find house keeping so we could check it out (after about 10 minutes searching for house keeping we were shown it) - it was a nice big room - had a decent balcony with views of the harbour/carpark.We were then told it would be 2 hours before it would be ready (2 hours to clean a room?) Small price to pay!! So we got into our room at 6pm. It was comfortable and clean with modern furniture. Location; Nice location for a walk along the harbour front - childrens play area not far from the hotel (just turn right out of hotel along the front). Some but not many restaurants nearby - they looked pricey! You definitely need a car but Seaworld and the zoo were easy from here. $5 parking fee per night. Services; Pool, fairly nice and just warm enough (have to walk through the bar area to get to it and you are on show). You have to ask for pool towels at reception and they often run out (in fact they promised to bring some out to us and yet again they did'nt). Bar, nice bar with a view serving food which was quite nice. They have a happy hour but service was VERY slow - 20 minutes to get table service (I saw others having the same problem too). Breakfast, the best service at this hotel! Our waiter was efficient and friendly. The breakfast was varied and I have no complaints there ;) They also had a small gym and a laundrette which was very handy. The walls seemed to be very thin, we could hear phone conversations and TV quite clearly from the next room. Overall, nice hotel, nice location, the staff need some customer service training (to clarify - not all the front desk staff were unhelpful either).
