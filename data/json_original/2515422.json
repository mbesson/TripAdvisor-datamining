It's located in Pacific Beach and either you will love the its edgy-funkiness (like Venice, California 20 years ago) or you will wonder what a sexy-cool hotel is doing in a neighborhood like this. If you have a large sense of entitlement, and seeing some grit and edge will just ruin your martini or G and T, do yourself a favor and stay in La Jolla just up the road. In PB, you are far more likely to score a tattoo than a designer boutique. That said, the hotel is a modern minimalist gem. All glass and white walls. A video loop of surfers plays endlessly on a small monitor the unpretentious lobby. The action here is in the Bar/Restaurant JRDN (pronounced a little surprisingly \"Jordan\", not \"jardin.\") Serving mostly very good food and a lively scene, it's particularly packed on weekends when the weather is good. The other great space is the Tower Deck on the second floor where white-towel covered lounge chairs surround something resembling a wading pool. I think it's six inches deep and I have never seen anyone so much as put their foot in there, so, hey, maybe it's just a water element or something. Nomenclature aside, it's a great place for a hang or a tan or to watch the joggers, surfers, runners and homeless people walk, run, or waddle by. The rooms are clean and uber-minimalist, almost sterile if it were not for the drop-dead views. I recently stayed in a Sanctuary Suite and loved the extra space and the jacuzzi tub looking out over the crashing waves of the Pacific. The bathroom also sports a small sink, a stand-alone shower and small slightly depressing room with a toilet. I am hoping it's fluorescent lighting is a green gesture and not a design choice. Yikes. Most if not all of the rooms have terraces on which you can see and/or hear the crashing of the Pacific. With \"art\" like that, who needs art in the rooms? This is not a place you come for white glove service, but the staff is young, attractive and happy to be helping you in any way they can. They try really hard, but sometimes you can really feel them trying and the strain shows. Bottom Line: This property is my first choice when I come to San Diego for any reason, business or pleasure. It's perfect for a romantic weekend, or whenever you want to get-away from it all. A recent four-day stay undid months of work/life stress. And if it worked for me, it might just work for you.

We shared 4 dinners at JRDN over the course of the week. We knew our waiters by name. The food was OUTSTANDING. Best oysters I've ever had--we compare all other oysters to the ones we had at JRDN. Room service: Room service was interesting because it wasn't just a room service delivery--it was like the restaurant came to you. We had loads of delicious breakfast foods included in our room rate. Every bit was executed with perfection. They were prompt and we loved our server, Meredith. And Josh--well, there were 2 Josh's. All were so much fun. Room: The products--OMG, the products!!! I can still smell them when I think back to Tower 23. The balmy lotion was my favorite. Seriously awesome products. The mini bar was well stocked, there were loads of snacks, and even souvenirs you could buy from the room. The robes were a good weight and we wore them a lot. The bed was enormous with tons of fluffy pillows. Chaise lounge was handy and comfortable. We loved our balcony, too. Nice sized closet and great TV.

However, after receiving these 2 bottles of Champagne and a 3rd to the room for NYE, we were carded by 3 different people before being allowed to be seated at our dinner reservation! The same people that had checked Us in and sent up champagne made my husband walk back up to our room to get my ID, then issued us a wristband. Even with the wristband now in place , a bouncer then came to ask us again for identification. Finally , the hostess seating us asked if we had our wristbands and if we were of age.

Finally, we were in and out of the hotel multiple times over our stay and other than check im and check out never received so much as a \"hello\" from the front desk staff standing right beside the elevator.

The room was of minimal design, bigger than ave size hotel and clean but nothing special, bed, chair, desk and tv, what you would expect anywhere. letters missing from the name on the hotel, shower gels not replenished. room cleaning was a bit hit and miss. you had to ring the 'schedule' and turn down service. who would bother doing this? if you are going to offer a service then just do it!? However my major complaint was the 24/7 room service they so call offer. On the second night we rang at 11.30pm to order and sandwich, we were told ham or cheese. my fiance asked could he have ham and salad and he was told no, they are premade. $12 for a premade sandwich is crazy so asked what else did they have, we were told cheese and crackers or a caeser salad.... I dont think this equates to 24/7 room service. Anyway we were hungry so we ordered two portions of cheese and crackers, the porter then asked did we want it delivered....is that not the point of room service? the tray was delivered by the security guard and we paid $24.

Long story short - she has a form of neuropathy that makes it impossible to sleep on a bad mattress. Trying to find a better hotel bed in Seattle eventually led to the discovery of a list of hotels in the US that offer Tempurpedic memory foam mattresses. This list led to our discovery of Tower 23 in Pacific Beach, or 'PB' as it's known by the locals. Our first visit to this little boutique hotel was in February 2011. It was a short visit, but the impression it left on us convinced us to come back for another, longer visit in September 2011. Let me state right up front, this hotel is not for everyone. It doesn't have a pool - this will turn some people off right away. We didn't care. We didn't come to San Diego to swim in a hotel pool. I've read other reviews on this hotel and noticed a few complaints about the homeless folks who pass by on the beachfront walkway. Pacific Beach has homeless people. You just can't get around that fact. We didn't find it intrusive or offensive in any way. They did not camp out near our hotel. On to what we liked. The bed, of course. If only every hotel had quality, memory foam mattresses, our trip planning would be so much easier and offer so many other choices. A definite win for Tower 23. The restaurant (JRDN) is great. Depending on the time of year, you can get breakfast there, but lunch and dinner are year-round and of high quality. One thing to be aware of when booking a room is that about half of the beach-facing rooms are directly over the restaurant / bar area. The restaurant has an outdoor patio as well and this place can get noisy when it's crowded. Weekend nights are worst. From our room on the third floor at the south end of the hotel, it wasn't too bad. We got a beach-front room and loved it. Being lulled to sleep by the sound of the surf is my idea of heaven. The bathroom is modern and well appointed. Nice big shower and a wonderful tub. The water runs into the tub from the ceiling, which is a little disconcerting at first, but it's OK. Just don't stand next to the tub for the first minute, or you'll get splashed. But it is a great tub. The rain shower is a nice touch. Tower 23 may not have a pool, but they do have a nice Sky Deck, a second floor outdoor deck overlooking the beach with lounge chairs and sofas and a fireplace for night-time. It's a popular spot and is often full of sunbathers in the afternoon. If you have a car, you may as well splurge on the $20 per day valet parking. Taking a chance to find parking on the street is taking a big risk, as the neighbourhood is very popular and I found it almost impossible to find parking near the hotel. It's just easier with the valet. I particularly love the location of the hotel, because you're right on the ocean, minutes from trendy La Jolla, a short drive from Fashion Valley Mall and easy access to the freeways that get you all around the San Diego area and up the coast to towns like Encinitas and Del Mar. We saved some money not renting a car at the airport and getting one in PB. So we're very glad we found this hotel.

The design of the overall hotel is pretty cool, a glass box over looking the ocean. Our room however was a big eh. I did not see the other rooms but based on the lowest priced room they're not really worth the price they are asking. The room itself is fine with a nice little balcony...unfortunately the balcony faces other people's rooms. They call it a courtyard view...but in actuality it's more like a voyeurs view. Our room abutted up another's balcony....enough so that their cigar smoke came into our room. Noise travels as well. If you craned your neck out the window you could see the ocean. The service, while friendly, was a little lax. When we arrived to check in (after a long flight) there was a gentlemen in front of us asking silly questions for what seemed like forever. There was only one person at the front desk, and instead of calling for help or answering questions while checking us in...we waited 10 minutes to check in. Clearly there should be a concierge person and a check in person...not just one person. We also returned home to find the valet parking closed at 10pm on saturday night. The gate was down. We came down to hang out on the deck in the afternoon, only to find no cushions or anywhere to sit. We had to run around to the front desk and get security to come open it. That's a little strange. All of these little glitches are understandable but at the price they were charging should not have happened. This is clearly a smallish design hotel but that doesn't mean they have to be small on service. That being said, the sunsets from this location are absolutely stunning. All in all I wouldn't discount a stay at the Tower23 but I can't say it's worth it for the cheapest room. If you want to stay at the beach then pony up the cash for the direct ocean view rooms.

They have a deck area at the hotel (second floor?) where you can lay out, order food/drinks, and see a nice view of the beach and watch people walk by. I thought they had a pool based on some pictures, but it's just a small little water feature. We ordered some drinks and appetizers and it was fine. Their restaurant always looked like a hip, happening spot for happy hour and early nights, but we always went out to different bars and try different restaurants in the area, so I don't really have a review on the scene at night and whether the food was good.

While establishments along the coast know there\u2019s no competing with the majestic ocean to attract its guests, Tower 23 incorporates the best of its surroundings in its architecture, views and decor, leaving guests feeling like they never left the beach when they step into the hotel. Bright and airy, highlighted with the hues of ocean blue, Tower 23 is sleek and posh at the same time. Accomodated in the Surf Pad, the king-sized Tempur-Pedic Serenity bed, made up with 100% Egyptian cotton linens, was heavenly to sink into. When it got too dark to gaze at the ocean from the balcony, there was a flat screen high-def LCD TV to entertain us.

To make your stay even more relaxing, Tower 23 also provides, upon request, in-room massage and spa services. Walking distance from a variety of cafes, restaurants and bars featuring anything from sushi, curry to burgers, Tower 23 itself houses one of the most popular lounge and restaurants on the beach. No kitschy nautical themes here, JRDN offers relaxed oceanfront dining for a great view of San Diego\u2019s beautiful sunset. A contemporary steak & seafood restaurant, JRDN offers an oyster bar as well as a private wine room. If you don\u2019t feel like traipsing the few steps to their main dining room, Sunset Patio or the Tower Deck for some casual Californian cuisine, 24 hour room service is available. Smack dab in the center of all things San Diego, Tower 23 puts you smack dab in the center of all things San Diego, whether you want to surf, golf, fish off the pier or just cruise the beach.

When you\u2019re done with all that fun, Tower 23 is there to provide a welcome respite.

We didn't get room service at all, but we did eat at Jrdn a couple of times - what great food!

When we arrived Nati and Jeremiah greeted us with warm smiles, quick registration and a complimentary cocktail.

The hotel is a modern boutique style. Perfect for a couples get away. We had a partial view on the North side 2nd floor which gave us a view of people on the boardwalk and the sunsets over the ocean. Both very entertaining. We were in the room no more than 20 minutes when a knock on the door came. A plate of wonderful brownies with rasberries and a happy birthday card was delivered by John (also smiling!) as a gift from the hotel. The restaurant also provided creme brulee as a birthday gift and tasty treat at the end of our meal. Try a sampling of the oysters... they are great, as are the scallops. In the mornings, you coffee/tea drinkers will love the Keurig in the lobby. We also recommend running just next door to Kona's for breakfast, but be sure to eat it on their \"hidden\" deck right above the beach. Even though we did the running to the zoo and sea world, it was great to come back to Tower23 early each day. There is no having to walk to get to the beach -- you're on it! The valet service is quick and friendly. Jeremiah, at the front desk always so it seemed, is a great resource and help. We didn't use this, but I heard him helping another couple with bike rentals. If you are on the street side, you do get some noise, but it was very entertaining for us. The bed is extremely comfortable and the shower is perfect for couples.

The AC works well and the shower has good pressure and is roomy. The view was beautiful, and the hotel is literally right on the boardwalk. We ate at the hotel restaurant which was amazing. The food was great, and we ate outside where the temperature was perfect, and the view was fantastic with lots of people and pet watching. They have valet parking and a garage. On our return stay we had a room without the ocean view, but it was just as nice. The only differences were instead of a shower stall we had a shower/tub combo and the view. Now the view was not of the ocean but it was interesting. Our room had sliding glass doors that looked right out onto the hotel's patio. It was a little disconcerting to have people right there while we were in our room. I think the windows were probably tinted and once the sun went down we closed the curtains so it wasn't a problem, it was just odd. The night of our second stay we walked down the boardwalk to World Famous. The food was really good, and we got to see the Fire Lane guys put on their fire juggling show as we were leaving.

I was looking for a luxury, upscale hotel that was on the beach, yet close to late-opening bars and night life. It was quite hard to find this. A lot of the resorts are either on the bay or miles from anything. Tower 23 is a modern, small and recently refurbished hotel in a prime location. It's right on Pacific Beach and has wonderful views from its terrace and bar/restaurant. It's a short walk away from a whole host of bars and restaurants in the casual Pacific Beach neighborhood. A cab to the classier Gaslamp district was $35 (in general I felt the taxis were very expensive in San Diego). The staff were mostly all excellent and tried hard to help us have a good stay. On the first night, the hotel manager made an exception to hotel policy by turning on the fire-pit on the roof for us. It was appreciated and he didn't have to do that. Another staff member brought blankets out for us. The drinks service on the terrace was also good. The hotel's bar and restaurant is excellent. It has great views of the ocean, very good quality brunch and the ambiance is perfect. I noticed a lot of locals go there for special occasions - birthday parties or weekend nights out. I booked the Sanctuary Suite at the hotel. This room was first rate. It was spacious and modern with a wet bar and comfortable bed. The signature feature, however, was the giant spa bathtub with a tap in the ceiling that fills it. Colored lights and powerful jacuzzi jets also make for a relaxing soak. DOWN SIDE: My hotel suite was very expensive and for the money I have experienced far more. It's basically a Peninsula or Four Seasons rate without a resort that even comes close to those type of hotels. Tower 23 is nice and well run -- but it doesn't have the scale or world class service of a true luxury hotel. It's more of a well put-together local hotel with a modern edge. Aside from the expensive price, my only other disappointments were: -No hotel pool - surprising! -They couldn't give us a late check out, and the normal check out time is a rather early 11am Otherwise, a great, relaxing and enjoyable experience.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cBest Beachfront Hotel in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "mwd05", "ReviewID": "UR90956178", "Content": "My husband and I recently spoiled ourselves with a night at Tower 23.

The decor is just what I expect from a \"boutique hotel\". Our room was decorated modernly with a bank of sliding glass doors which offered up a full ocean view. The service was outstanding from the moment we checked in to the final check out, four days later. The second story deck is where we ended every day lounging in a chaise, drinking a glass of wine and eating the steamed mussels with chorizo, capped by breathtaking sunsets. Drew, our waiter those evenings, gave us impecable service along with a nice array of menu selections , which is probably why we didn't venture elswhere. We were there mid January, and the boardwalk between the beach and the hotel was not too busy until Sunday when the locals turned out for \"Sunday-Funday\". The only drawback with being beachside, was late around 2am when the \"last call\" revelers would walk down the sidewalk and wake us up. I'm sure that could have been allieviated if I hadn't instisted on keeping the sliding door wide open every night, but listening to the ocean was a must.....

We loved Tower23 the first time. We loved it even better the second time. And this has even improed with our third stay. So far we only stayed in the Surf Pads, right at the front of the hotel. We had different rooms each time, on the part away from the bar which I would recommend. They are all basically the same, only one got a separate shower stall, but we could noy get it this year. Same with this price tag. What do we like ? The STAFF is young and smiling and willing to help. But this is no Four Seasons by any mean ! SITUATION-situation-situation !!! It is all about it : right on the beach. Could not get any closer, except perhaps one of the privat beach house at Malibu. Anyone, if you think of a hotel of this standard on the West Coast closer to the ocean than Tower23, please share it with me. The STYLE is great. We are a very traditional same sex couple in our 40s, and we love luxury. We travel a lot. This is a special place : not the most luxurious. There is a nice vibe to it. Plenty of different people mingle, but you can have total privacy and tranquillity(that you would not have in a room right on the deck). The DECK is a highlight, at any given time. For sunbathing, for having a drink, for smoking by the fire pit. Would it be better with a pool ? My partner tends to think so, I personnally prefer the space. The UPKEEP is amazing. Despite an oceanfront situation, the whole place is immaculate. Not a glitch or a hint of ageing. They do a great job at that. HOUSEKEEPING is fantastic. I do not generally rave on housekeeping and how fantastic a clean room is; it should be standard in any accomodation, let alone a premium accomodation. But everyday, these guys clean thewindows and the glass balcony, so that he view is not spoilt. Worth mentionning, especially in the perspective of the poor job most urban luxury hotels do. The RATES; not cheap of course, but they come down year after year. Business must be slow. Breakfast food is good. Not terrific.But good. Although we got tired of the limited choice after a couple of days. And having breaksfast on the balcony is great. DIRECT ACCESS to the beach is extremely convenient. What do we dislike ? VALET PARKING is a rip-off. Given that free parking is very limited, and this is no San Francisco, they hot hard on that. Mind them, business was so slow that we managed to park free on the roads every time. CLOSED RESTAURANT until 11.00 am. So we had breakfast on the balcony. Which was great. Holding our plates on our knees was a disgrace. It as last year, and still is this year. So please guys, open up earlier for breakfast, or bring in a table ! DIRECT ACCESS from the beach is no more possible. They removed the opening device. Most unconvenient when you want to walk to the deck with a cigar.

We split our time between T23 and the Loews in Coronado. I was hesitant to stay at the hotel because there was no pool , however I liked that it was right on the beach. I think my husband was a little shocked when we pulled in since the hotel is literally in the back of a parking lot. After checking in we were told that there would be a party out in the deck area. What the front desk failed to mention was that the \"small party\" was basically an open party to all of pacific beach. So after a long flight from NY we couldn\u2019t even relax on our balcony because there was essentially a wet t-shirt contest going on below us. Needless to say not the kind of thing you expect from a hotel that charges upwards of $250 a night. We kindly asked the front desk to move us just for the night to an ocean front room. This way we could at least relax without having to deal with the blaring music, since our room overlooked the deck area. They told us of course we would be able to do it for another $80 a night. That really set me off because they should put the comfort of their guest first., as the money wasnt the issue for us. When the party finally ended after 6, we went back up the deck area which was by now a mess and it seemed that all of the other hotel guest began emerging from their rooms also. Our next few days at T23 weren't as bad, they sent us up some free champange which was a nice effort. The food at JRDN is very good and, the view from the deck of the beach is A+. The server on the deck Drew was great and extremely attentive, he was as attentive as I thought the rest of the staff at T23 should have been. The hotel is close to La Jolla which is nice if you want a change of scenery. My last complaint about T23 is that on our last day there was a foul mouthed hotel employee who was getting wasted with one of her friends on the deck . Apparently it was her day off and she was using her discount ... I wasn\u2019t listening to her conversation she was just that loud that I couldn\u2019t help but overhear.

We had the perfect view of the ocean which allowed us to enjoy the beautiful sunset along with the great sounds of the waves. The size of the room was perfect for my boyfriend and I and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. We slept like babies. The hotel also has a great restaurant where we enjoyed a romantic dinner with a view of the ocean. Here again the waiter and accompanying staff were very attentive and pleasant.

Great company, awesome food, a fabulous room with the perfect view, what more could a girl ask for.

The location of the hotel is perfect too. Literally just a few steps to the beach. The hotel is right in the middle of the action too. Just behind it is a supermarket for mixes, wine, whatever.

Valet parking quick and courteous. Check in informed and efficient. We had a package affair with my name personalized onto each appropriate voucher. Nice touch. As it is a popular night spot as well if you want to take advantage of sleeping with balcony doors open I'd also recommend requesting a room on the beach south end of building as the noisier action below is at the north end of the hotel building.

We did eat at the restaurant Jordans one day for lunch and the food and service were wonderful. They serve Sushi at night but we never got a chance to try it. Our Bellman Randy was very helpful and knowledgable about the area and even filled our ice bucket up for us.

I would like to share the exceptional service we received from Tower23 (Erin Brady) in planning, accommodating our guests, and perfecting our destination wedding in San Diego. I contacted Tower23, namely Erin Brady about 6 months before our February 23rd wedding date. We are partial to the pacific beach area (We are St. Louis, MO residents, but I was born and raised in San Diego) and were in search of a hotel that could comfortable accommodate about 25 of our wedding guests that we were flying to San Diego. We explained to Erin that although we planned to host our wedding ceremony and reception on Crystal Pier, we were in need of a hotel for our guests, that would be affordable, beachfront, in walking distance from the pier (Tower23 is literally a few foot steps down the boardwalk from the pier). Erin offered us a room block for our guests that included a great nightly rate, and very flexible reservation/cancellation limits, and BEAUTIFUL rooms. Tower23 is literally beachfront property; the view from your room is the Pacific Ocean, the pier, and the boardwalk. San Diego is captured right from your window or deck. The architecture is a new, modern, and gorgeous building. The rooms are crisp, clean, spacious, and soothing. The beds and linens are so exceptional that many of our guests jumped online to try to purchase the same mattresses and linens for their homes. You can literally melt into the beds for hours. The decks have a clean uninterrupted view of the water, full of lounge chairs, a fire ring, and wading pool and waterfall next to you. It is so spa like and tranquil there, a true vacation. Sure there is La Jolla, and Coronado Island, but really I feel like Pacific Beach gives a much more authentic San Diego experience to travelers. The swimming (and surfing) portion of the beach is directly in front of Tower23, and the hotel in \u00bd block from Garnet Avenue, which is the best street to hit for restaurants, bars, retail shops, and an authentic beach community. The food at the JRDN (Tower23\u2019s attached restaurant) is awesome, we had the sushi, calamari, steak and fries, and the goat cheese dip, our table was very pleased, we loved everything. Oh, and the drinks, the cocktails are so good, make sure to indulge at least one night on your stay! I want to also make note that the staff at Tower23 was amazing. Erin Brady helped us, kept us updated, reassured me as \u201cthe day\u201d approached, and accommodated even our most last-minute guests every step of the way. She was available anytime we needed her. The staff at the front desk accommodated many very unusual last minute needs or ours, and were always very willing to help in any way that they could. Just days before our wedding day we ran into a problem with our hired caterer for our reception at Crystal pier, my mom scrambled last minute to find a back up venue and caterer in case issues worsened, and sure enough Erin was there, ready and willing to help if we needed her. She was the only piece of mind that we had at that point. We had all of our guests come up to us at one time or another to tell us how friendly and helpful the staff at Tower23 was. And again everyone ranted and raved about how clean, beautiful, and comfortable the rooms were.

The restaurant took very good care of our group and the food and drink was very good. We sat outside and, by adjusting our seats, there was just the right combination of radiant heat and fresh air to suit everyone. This hotel is probably the best hotel in Pacific Beach (certainly not in San Diego), but there were several small things that a hotel in this price range should do better. We had a \"surf\" room that meant the room overlooked the Pacific Ocean. Although the San Diego area isn't overly warm in mid-December, our room was too warm even with the heat control turned all the way down. The central system apparently didn't allow for cooling at this time of year. So our only choice for sleeping was to open the large sliding doors and curtains. This arrangement won't suit those who don't like the sounds of the surf, and the Saturday night boardwalk scene, to drift in. Since our doors were open, unfortunately, our peaceful Sunday morning sleep-in was marred by the sound of passing skateboards on the concrete sidewalk outside. Others in our group had \"surf\" rooms also, but with the added feature of overlooking the second floor outdoor social/firepit area. At least one of these rooms was too warm also but opening the large sliding door allowed in too much of the noise from the crowd outside until the bar/restaurant closed. Our room was clean and modern, if a little spare. The only chair was the straight-back chair for the desk. The shower drain was clogged so much that we had to stagger our showers to give the water time to drain. The lamp over the smallish wash basin hung down directly in front of the narrow mirror so that anyone over about five and half feet tall needed to look to one side or the other to use the mirror. The separate bathtub's water supply entered directly out of a chrome fixture (basically a plate with a hole in it) in the CEILING. (Alternate guess: someone had removed the shower head that might have been there originally). As you might imagine, water falling from the ceiling into an empty tub splashed out onto the floor until the tub acquired an inch or two of water. I've included a picture of the tub's water outlet in the ceiling with the water running. This is a personal preference, but in mid-December we found only an arrangement of red amaryllis in the lobby that might be called a Christmas decoration. Nothing more was in evidence.

We get away about 5-6 times per year and all we look for is to truly get what we pay for. We want cleanliness and we aren't into the \"tourist\" stuff that others seek. We both have very demanding jobs and just like to get away to get away from the rat race and do \"nothing\" for the week. Our trip started in L.A. as we wanted to take in two hockey games there (tickets at home are just impossible to get). Our plan was to leave right after those two games and then get down to the San Diego area to watch the waves crash on the shore from our oceanview room and spend some quality time together. When we arrived at the Tower 23, the experience could have taken a horrible turn. The original check-in was done by a male (who shall remain nameless for now) who really obviously couldn't have cared less and who really shouldn't be part of the Tower 23 team!!! He lied to us and tried to give us a room just immediately over the bar/restaurant although we specifically asked what was below us. He advised \"a room\" and fluffed us off and sent us on our way asap! We were extremely early and there was really no reason why he couldn't just put us in a quiet room right off the bat. He told us he could only do it if we agreed to switch rooms during our stay and this was not something we were about to do for the price we were paying. After returning from a nice long walk (rooms are guaranteed by 4pm), we saw that the front desk person had changed and thankfully, we approached Nancy. She immediately took charge of the situation. Having told her that we were looking for quiet time and would be spending a lot of time \"in\" or on the balcony, she quickly changed us to an amazing room on the top floor...just what we had paid for! From that point on, the visit was flawless!!! The rooms are very clean, the amenities are lovely and there are housecoats and lovely linen and towels for guest use. Although we didn't eat in the restaurant downstairs, it looked to be quite well attended by all. There is an amazing rooftop lounging area off the 2nd floor which overlooks the ocean. We saw many people there who spent the entire day and early evening (when they light the firepit and heat lamps) just relaxing and taking in the view. Quite simply, we tried to do what the locals do and ate where locals eat and often picked up and brought the food back to the room so we could eat on the balcony, sip nice wine and listen to the wonderful ambient sounds on the room music player. During the day , we walked down the boardwalk and took in 2 hr strolls. We went out for a couple of \"nice\" meals but Toronto is such a cosmopolitan city that there was really little we could get there that we couldn't get at home. That wasn't the purpose of the trip. This spot is amazing. You can blend in or rent a car and go into the city. We did both and had an incredible time. Once again, cudos to Nancy at the front desk for being so professional from the time we arrived to the time when we checked out!!!

It is about $30 from the airport and about the same to downtown San Diego. I was attending a business meeting /convention and was happy to be staying at this smaller property a bit away from it all with good reviews. I had a rental car which costs $20 per nite to park at the property. The rates per nite are pricey so I was expecting an experience consistent with such a rate. I arrived at about 2:30 PM after two long flights ; i travel a great deal and this was the end of a busy travel season . It was a Saturday afternoon and the front desk person indicated that the room was not ready and that they guarantee the room for 4 PM. This is approaching the late side for check in as most hotels are for 3 PM check-in. She asked for my cell phone and said she would call me when the room was ready. She did not do this and I returned after 3:15 PM and asked about my room and another gentleman indicated that my room was ready.

The nite manager was thoroughly inept and the daytime manager with whom I reviewed the matter was very gracious and abated one nite's charge by 50%. But the experience fouled my sense of the place. The bar is hopping and I enjoyed being out for drinks with colleagues on one nite. The restaurant is simply outstanding with beautifully prepared food and staff who are professional across all domains. Rivalled any restaurant experience in great dining places around the country. But the management has to decide whether this is an upscale boutique hotel or whether it is a function hall . The manager made a decision to sell drinks through the nite on the private courtyard the remnants of which I captured on my cell phone camera in the early AM and to ruin the experience of others versus asking the party to move to the very large bar at the other end of the hotel.It was a bad decision on the manager's part and which he never addressed.

The decor, for example, is late American modernism, but the furniture looks and feels like it was purchased at Ikea and assembled by the staff. The hotel advertises free wi-fi, but the wi-fi wasn't working too well when I was there this week. They offered to provide me with a \"better\" speed internet access via a cable connector.

We could hear people talking in the room next door, and footsteps in the room above were thudding along almost all the time. I've stayed places where this was the norm and its fine as long as you know about it and are prepared for it. The balconies are very nice and I spent a fair amoun of time sitting out there watching the ocean.

The room was very roomy. Our room was just above the bar area. The noise on Saturday was pretty awful. On Friday not so bad. On Monday it was great. I would stay here again. Good granola/yogurt breakfast! Very hip place. You have to pay $12 daily for parking. The valets were great! Overall a nice experience in a great location.

The rooms are large and very comfortable. This is NOT a family hotel, but very nice for singles and couples. The staff was very helpful and friendly. When I had a very rowdy crowd keeping me awake next door, the hotel clerk and the security guard came to the offender's door and took care of the problem right away. The restaurant is excellent, particularly for breakfast and lunch. My only complaint is that they should ban cell phones in the restaurant. I do not need to hear people's personal business while I sit with my morning paper and cup of tea. The location is great, too. Also, the weather is perfect in August.

We couldn't do another trip until about 9 months later, and actually, we weren't sure we wanted to go back, even for free. But we did and man, have they improved. Both visits we stayed at the sweet suite...and it is. The best beach view, wonderful bed and the coolest bathtub. Everything was really clean, and that's important, I hate dirty hotels, especially the bathroom. The Jordan restaurant is directly under the balcony, makes for good people watching but does get a bid loud at night. We were traveling with two very young kids so we were in our rooms by around 8:00 every night, so the noise was a little annoying, but really not that bad. Jordan really fills up at night, looked like fun. The food there is great, try the filet, yum. Being so close to the beach was great, I highly recommend the Tower. If staying there try the sweet suite. If not that room be sure to get one with a beach view, they are limited. Some of the views/patios are in a common area, I personally wouldn't like that, people can stare right into your room. Overall, love the place.

The view from our Surf Pad room was gorgeous. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and I loved the modern look. However, it was sometimes a case of form over function. The bath shower was somewhat broken when we arrived and the handle on the shower came off. The toilet paper holder was angling toward the ground so the roll wanted to slide off. Nothing was wrong that an allen wrench couldn't fix and when I reported the issues they fixed them promptly. Well, all but the toilet paper roll holder as I didn't report that. I really wanted the shower working properly and didn't want to confuse the issue. The lighting looked nice but it really wasn't bright enough to do makeup. I think all the minimal hard surfaces also allowed sound to travel as we could hear the neighboring rooms more than I would have expected. The Tower bar was ultra cool and there was a long line to get into the restaurant bar downstairs on the weekend nights. We only had breakfast in the restaurant and it was another ultra cool spot. I had to laugh when the waters came with mangled chucks of lemon hanging to the side. All that look and they cannot slice a lemon. I suppose it is more likely that mangled lemon is the new new thing and I am just behind. The staff was amusing. It was like watching kids play dress up. It seemed the valet staff knew more than anyone about how to handle guests. The others seemed too young for their jobs.

The furnishings and the rooms are very thoughtfully designed. There's a low-height table that's perfect for placing your bags if you don't want to unpack, and the Do Not Disturb sign is an electronic button on the wall rather than a flimsy piece of cardboard. The staff respected the do not disturb and let us sleep until 4pm after we had a very late night. We had a sanctuary suite which was absolutely incredible - I want this bathroom for my own house. The water falls in a perfect, quiet stream from the ceiling into a truly massive bathtub jacuzzi with colored underwater lights and three different kinds of bubble jets. My husband and I both got into it easily; I think it would be easy to fit four normal-sized people, or to swim in it if you're alone. The bathroom is separated from the rest of the one-room suite by only a curtain, which gives a nice open feel to the whole space. Later in our visit we also stayed in a surf pad room, with a full ocean view. We slept with the sliding door open to hear the waves. We also loved the neighborhood; you can walk along Pacific Beach and have breakfast by the ocean, or you can walk to funky secondhand shopping along Garnet Street which is a little like L.A.'s Melrose. There are many businesses within a third of a mile of the hotel - drugstores, supermarkets, Uno's pizza, Denny's, places that rent rollerblades and surf equipment, ice cream from ColdStone and Dairy Queen, et cetera. If you like to be in the heart of the action, this is the place. Because the hotel is small, there's plenty of staff attention paid to each guest. The front desk printed out boarding passes for me with no hesitation (their business center isn't open yet.)

Rooms are nice, no coffeemakers, but coffee was available downstairs, in a very awkward place (near the elevators), and was only available until 9am or so.

I needn't have worried -- it was up there with the best hotels at which I've ever stayed, and most certainly was the coolest of them all. The TOWER23 hotel is an anomaly, an ultramodern hotel set in a bit of a funky beach town (the Pacific Beach area of San Diego). There's nothing nearby that's like it -- accomodations in the area range from mid-range condominiums to dilapidated cottages set on a pier. But the setting doesn't detract from the TOWER23, and in fact seems to bring it into sharper relief. I had an oceanfront room, a \"Surf Pad,\" which was delightful. The bathroom was stylish, the shower large and equipped with a rain-style head. The bed was one of the two or three most comfortable I've ever slept on. The flat panel TV was great, and I used the Xbox to play DVDs that I had brought with me (you can borrow movies from the front desk, or there's a Blockbuster next door). The room had both wired and wireless connections to the hotel's free Internet service. But the star of the room was the view -- a third-story, top-floor view of the boardwalk, the beach, and the ocean. Sunsets were absolutely spectacular. The TOWER23 has its own ocean-view restaurant, JRDN. I had excellent sushi rolls there on two occasions, and my companion and I both thought that the breakfast we had was one of the best we could remember, and reasonably priced. At night, JRDN becomes a very hip club, and we took advantage of this almost every evening during our stay. Bring stylish clothes! The hotel has a second-floor deck with comfortable seating and a fire pit, the modern style with flames dancing over sand. We spent some very pleasant evenings there drinking cocktails brought up from the club below. I wouldn't recommend the TOWER23 for people who want a very quiet hotel. Although the rooms are soundproofed quite well, once JRDN becomes a club at night, it becomes fairly loud, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. This wasn't an issue for us, as we were making use of it, but I can see some people having problems with it. Nor would I recommend the hotel for people with small children -- the beach is really the only place for them to run around, as there's no pool or playspace of any kind -- it's just not that kind of hotel. To travelers looking for a beachfront hotel, a trendy place to stay, or a hotel where one can party into the wee hours, I can't recommend the TOWER23 highly enough. It's less expensive than many of the dull mega-hotels in the city, but with better rooms and polite, boutique-style service.
