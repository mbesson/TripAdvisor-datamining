Anything over $29.99 is WAY too much for this dirty, smelly, and falsely advertised motel. It's only redeeming quality is that it's across the street from Circus Circus and costs slightly less. Our family felt dirty just standing in the lobby, the parking lot, and the room. The advertised free breakfast is basically nonexistent (small packaged muffins only), the internet service is weak at best, and the rooms were disgusting. On a brighter note, at least there was a locked cage on the window to keep the riff-raff out. It's not very comforting looking through your barred up window at an abandoned parking lot (on the strip no-less). We overpaid because we passed through town on a Saturday night during the NCAA tournament, but if you're asked to pay anything over $29.99 find somewhere else. Oh yeah, one more thing - we heard every noise that was made in the rooms on each side of us and above us.

I had to pay 110.$ for a pretty bad room. Did not want to know who was in this room before me. Pretty shabby. Also scary because I was on the ground floor and I was a woman alone We are in the shadow of Circus Circus. Took a sleeping pill to be able to sleep and forget where I was. A few channels on TV, the sheets were stained the breakfast was terrible a few wrinkle muffins and yogourt or was it juice? Did not touch it, went to Denny's instead. I wonder what year this hotel was built, did not see any pool but a vaccant lot at the back... Old windows looked like old windows on a old mobile home... Could not wait to get out of there. The lady at the front desk was nice. I could hear somebody walking and moving things around on the second floor just over my head and people walking right by my windows with curtains that did not close properly. No sound proof there. Note I am not a gambler and doesn't like Vegas I was just there to take a plane the next day.

The carpets were absolutely horrible, and no amenities other than a coffee pot. As for a great location, there is little but construction nearby so its quite a walk down the strip. Yes, its pet friendly, but your dog had better be used to using the concrete, as grass is in short supply. We found a better rate and cleaner quarters on the west side- still quick to get to the strip where free parking is abundant anyway. I would not advise anyone to stay here.

Travelodge was brilliant. Really great value for money. Its close to the strip, much closer than the motor manor lodges at Circus Circus which are about the same price. The rooms aren't big, especially by Vegas standards, but the bed was comfortable and bathroom amenities provided. We booked a smoking room, and it did have quite a strong smell to it, but this was our mistake when booking and really I shouldn't complain. Our room had coffee making facilities - the first time I have seen this in any hotel in Vegas, so was quite happy about that. There was a pool! Really wasn't expecting that. It got sunlight quite late into the day and there was no one else in it. A private pool in Vegas, you don't mind that often! The rooms had complimentary wifi which was another unexpected bonus. In fact everything about this Travelodge surpassed my expectations. I booked it a little disappointed that I hadn't got my act together and booked a hotel, but the Travelodge proved a great success and when I was sulking about my room in the Flamingo a few days later, I wish I had gone straight back. The staff at the Travelodge were lovely!! Don't rule Travelodge out for your stay in Vegas!", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warren, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGood news, bad news\u201d", "Author": "TLMitchell", "ReviewID": "UR120441874", "Content": "In a town with thousands and thousands of rooms at every price point why would anyone stay in a motel that's seen better days? Personally, I prefer a direct-exit where you can park in front of your door for easy access to your vehicle. Few and far between amidst the plethora of high-rise hotels & casinos. Good news, Michelle and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The accomodations, while a bit dated and rough around the edges, were comfortable and adequate. My smoking room actually had a clean, fresh smell with just a mild odor of disinfectant spray. Not so good.... unlike almost every other place you check in these days there was no microwave or refrigerator in the room. A portable refrigerator is available for a reasonable additional charge. Try finding a place to plug it in! All of the wall plugs were two-prong only, the fridge requires the 3rd ground hole. The maintenance gentleman finally resorted to plugging it in around the corner in the bathroom. Speaking of outlets.... a nice work desk for working on the computer... with no outlet anywhere within reach! The WiFi range was extremely limited, although I wasn't far from the office I was able to connect sporadically and experienced frequent disconnects. A friend staying at Circus Circus across the street gave me their password and I used their WiFi. The worst... the floor of the shower was absolutely disgustingly cruddy! As is seen frequently in many mid-priced motels, housekeeping staff spritzes some cleaner or disinfectant in tubs and showers and gives them a wipe making them *appear* somewhat clean. The floors rarely get the good scrub required to keep the crud from being embedded. The first morning upon discovering this I showered in my socks because I forgot my flip-flops and I didn't want any part of my body touching anything in that shower stall. I picked up some shower togs locally as well as some Soft Scrub and an abrasive cleaning pad and my efforts didn't put a dent in the crud on the shower floor! One other not-so-hot feature, there are several enclosed stairwells leading to the 2nd floor. If you get a room located behind one of these enclosures you won't have a clue whether it's night or day when you open your door. They totally block the outside world. Would I stay here again? Possibly, if it was important to have easy access to my vehicle. I'd take a closer look at the room before unpacking though. I'm not one to complain too much although I'm sure the staff would have changed my room if I had asked.

We chose this Travelodge because of price, and location on The Strip, and there being no reports of bedbugs. There's no wifi in the rooms, but we knew that going in. I hadn't been to LV since I was a kid and didn't have a very good sense of the Strip. Now that the Sahara is closed and other places have been torn down, Circus Circus is in a rather isolated part of the Strip. We ended up using the Monorail, but because the Sahara is closed, it's a LONG walk to the station from this motel because the Monorail veers off the Strip at the north end--the walk in the summer is quiet oppressive!
