Security doesn't feel good - many room doors open onto open air stairways - anyone can walk into the Hotel, literally! No elevators so prepare to hump your bags around! The location for access to San Diego is poor. Cabs to the Old Town cost 13 dollars each way, 17 dollars to the Gaslamp area. The nightlife and restaurants are best in the Gaslamp area which is why I would recommend a large hotel ( Marriott or Manchester Hotel in the downtown bay area. Cab drivers usually do not know this hotel. The hotel website boasts free transport into town - this ended at 5.00pm and I saw no evidence of it in any case. The on-site Postcards Bistro is uninviting, I didn't try the food though. Also be aware that some of the poolside 'rooms' are used for external group meetings and conventions. This is a well meaning hotel but it really doesn't cut the mustard for a city such as San Diego. Personally I'd look elsewhere and not be taken in by claims of easy access to the main town areas.

Jeff who runs the shuttles was our perfect tourist guide, giving us the inside tips what to see first at the zoo, and making extra runs to fit us in as we forgot to book the shuttle the previous night.

The rooms were quite small (we had a crib as well in our room) however we didn\u2019t spend all that much time in the room anyway. The room and bathroom were both very clean. There is a coffee shop downstairs, which came in very handy with the kids, as we were able to buy milk, snacks etc. however it does close early. Breakfast that was included was good although it would be nice if they could include some hot breakfast items. We were a little confused on our first day how the coupons worked as our waitress did not tell us even where we could get out breakfast from as it was hidden behind the restaurant bar. Some days we were charged for the toast we ordered whilst other days we weren\u2019t but we never did query it as it only a few dollars. We dined in their restaurant and used room service quite a few times and the food was very nice. The shopping centre Fashion Valley is very close by (10 minute walk) which was a really nice big shopping centre; wish we had more time to shop there!

Initially when I went shopping for a room I came here to tripadvisor and read the reviews about the hotel which were decidedly positive. Then I decided to take it one step further and actually call the hotel in order to get a few more questions answered and get a feel for the professionalism of the staff, as I'm one of these people who firmly believes that you can tell a lot about a place by the tones of the voices you hear over the phone and how they handle your call or your inquiry. The guy I talked to was Jason who was super professional and welcoming, not to mention extremely informative about the Mission Valley area as well as the hotel itself. At the end of our chat he even went above and beyond by telling me to ask for him at check in and he would see to it that we were not only well taken care of but also that he would hook us up with whatever upgrades he could. While he wasn't actually there when we checked in - he had already worked his shift and was done for the day - I dropped his name and what he told me to the girl at the front desk and she was more than accommodating by wasting no time in upgrading our room to one with a patio which I thought was nice. Every single person working there is friendly and courteous and helpful and seems to really care about seeing to it that your stay at their hotel is an excellent one and you can tell this straight away. The room, I'm happy to say, was nicely appointed, VERY clean and comfortable, and at night was PERFECTLY quiet for relaxing and sleeping which is a huge deal to me, especially when you've stayed at enough places in the past where the walls were thin and you could hear all kinds of noise from people out by the pool, etc. Not so with this place and just on this point alone I would stay here again. Also the Handlery is well situated as it is well within about a 15 minute walking distance to a really nice mall as well as the trolley station for local transit. This came in handy as a few times I had to buy some things that we needed and also my bank had an ATM there which was perfect because I really don't like to pay the fees that come with banking at a foreign (bank other than your actual bank) ATM. We will definitely book at the Handlery next time we hit the Con. The only thing I think I would change or make better, and this is not necessarily a criticism so to speak, is if the Handlery could somehow find a way to provide transportation to and from the airport. There's a limo service that does a lot of business there (in addition to taxis pulling up there in front all the time), I think it was called Green Ride or something like that, and it costs about $25 to get to the airport ($21 plus $4 gratuity) and that's what we ended up having to go with. Perhaps it has something to do with being located in Mission Valley I'm not sure but like I said it's not a criticism of the place overall. GREAT job Handlery staff and thank you again!

The free shuttle bus was great, taking us to, and picking us up from San Diego Zoo, Old Town and Balboa Park.

As such, we were grossly unprepared for a last-minute booking in the tourism-rich San Diego area during peak summer season. We settled on the Handlery due to a special rate offered by Hotels.com. The hotel's architecture is reminiscent of a large \"motor inn\" from the late 50's or early 60's (it recalls the Vagabond motels of my childhood). The rooms are a little more compact than those of more modern hotels, but the Handlery has a trick up its sleeve - high ceilings that create the impression of more space. Even so, what the room may lack in space is more than compensated for by its appointments. The desk has an actual desk chair. The coffee condiments come in an open basket, not sealed plastic packages pre-measured by cheapskates who don't know how to enjoy coffee. The biggest surprise was that every time we turned on the flat-screen television, it went to the last channel we were watching, rather than a promo channel. How uniquely progressive! The design of the hotel may appear to be decades old, but recent renovations are obvious, including a modern, muted color palette with granite counter tops and medium gold wallpaper. Were I to find one nit to pick, the bathroom seems to be next in line for renovation. Although the shower curtain was lovely, the fixtures were a little dated, the tile could have used just a tad of re-grouting, and the ceiling showed a handful of paint flecks. I would be interested in seeing the bathrooms once they are renovated, as well. The hotel had some fun events planned by the pool, regrettably none of which we had time to attend. The first was open-air movies, the other was Sunday happy hour, complete with live band. These were free and open to the public, demonstrating the hotel's eagerness to be an inclusive part of its local community, rather than being exclusive. Booking in the middle of the summer season, we didn't have the luxury of getting one of those packages other reviewers have talked about that included continental breakfast. Be that as it may, travelers who choose this option to save money are truly missing out, not only because the continental breakfast is paltry, but because the regular breakfast served at the hotel restaurant is fantastic. In the interest of full disclosure, the Executive Sous Chef is a friend of ours, but in complete honesty, both our entrees were original and delicious. I had peanut butter and banana french toast for melt-in-my-mouth yumminess, while my wife had \"La Revolucion\", an amazing egg scramble with chorizo cooked inside hash browns (so each flavor infuses the other), and topped with sliced chili peppers. The entrees are comparable to what would be expected from a \"higher caliber\" hotel, yet the price is only about $10 each, so they are a bargain. All in all, the Handlery is not your typical hotel. It offers a pleasant decor, \"why-didn't-I-think-of-that\" accoutrements, and plenty of great experiences without leaving the property. My wife and I consider our initial taste intriguing, and the Handlery will certainly be at the top of our list of hotels to consider next time we need one in the San Diego area.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cSo happy we chose this hotel - especially during crazy Comic Con weekend!\u201d", "Author": "SomSom129", "ReviewID": "UR116079589", "Content": "We were attending Comic Con in SD and all available hotels were ridiculously priced for the weekend. The nightly rate was very reasonable considering all this, and I was in for such a pleasant surprise. ROOMS- were very clean, bathroom modern and clean and wow the shower was great - water pressure was high, what a nice bonus that was. Soap was lemony yum and shampoo was also pleasant. They had a dryer and iron as well. We had a balcony upgrade for free which was great. Mini fridge available but no microwave (boo). PARKING- plenty of spaces near our hotel room, but I think it's ridiculous to charge 12 per day for hotel guests. It would be better to just back it into the price instead of remembering to calculate into our expenditures. POOL- one of the nicest hotel pools I've seen. Not packed when we went, which was a surprise, and everyone should know that the pool itself is open to the public - so anyone can come in , park and enjoy this pool too. I don't think that's a well known fact due to the # of people I saw at the pool each day. Pool was large and L shaped, kids stayed mostly to the shallow part, and us adults enjoyed plenty of space in the deeper section. There is a whirlpool/hot tub there but since there were oodles of kids in there, my boyfriend and I didn't want to um, share with that. You should expect the whirlpool to be occupied at all times! Still, that was ok with us. Indoor bar onsite, served pretty decent food and just about all drinks. Pool closed at 10pm. On certain nights they show a movie poolside at 8pm. Great concept, expect since the pool closes at 10, you may have people - ok KIDS - splashing and screaming in the pool, and so unless you are like right up on the screen, may be hard to hear. Maybe someone should rethink the rules or set up a louder speaker system when they do movie night.. it was a nice experience for us except for the moments of noise, screaming, and occasional splash of water on us (really parents? you couldn't be just a little bit more considerate of us by asking your kids to keep it down a little or just not to splash us?? Hello!) I think the hotel would get more people to watch movies if they restrategize this, thus making the set up and equipment worth it. STAFF- pleasant enough, no complaints here. WIFI - you have to pay $10 a day for WiFi. Really? Another gripe - so if you're driving in, and need to use your computer, tack on 22 buckaroos per day between parking and wifi fees. Since we stayed 5 days, that can really add up. Thankfully my phone allowed for mobile hotspot so we bypassed that, but it was a big pain. Nowadays nearly every place has free Wifi - we stopped at a Super 8 on our costal drive up to San Francisco and even they had free wifi! Come on - the parking and wifi may be enough to turn a lot of people away from this hotel, so I highly recommend rethinking this. My boyfriend couldn't stop complaining about the costs and I really wished the price was baked into the nightly rate so it didn't annoy me as much. Overall, the hotel was wonderful, easy to find, reasonable car ride from all major sights of beautiful San Diego. If I had to go back, I may not go back only b/c of the extra fees which I really feel are ridiculous for this hotel.

We checked in at the nice, cool lobby, and check in was swift and painless, with friendly staff. We were asked if we needed assistance with our bags, which we declined. Again, we took our own bags to our second floor room, and somehow five flights of stairs were involved., and no elevator in sight (I'm sure there's one somewhere). We were offered help, so no complaints, just an observation. We were given a poolside room, so we had a nice view of the large pool, and a small outside deck with a couple of chairs. The Handlery is apparently trying to be somewhat of a destination for locals as well as tourists, and they are providing a variety of entertainment. The night we arrived, there was live music and a band was setting up. The existing tables, chairs and chaise lounges were all taken, but additional chairs were brought out by staff, so someone was paying attention to the needs of the guests. Anyway, I did notice that the staff was totally on top of guest noise from the pool area and made sure that the pool shut down right on time. The room itself was quite well appointed and very comfortable. Again, in-room coffee (a virtual must for me) and a refrigerator were provided. The bathroom was large enough, with a shower/tub combination. We spent most of the evening poolside, and made a quick trip down to Old Town for some great Mexican food recommended to us by the really helpful and friendly security officer. The room was absolutely quiet and because of the non-linear lineup of rooms, we heard no other guests, so a great night's sleep was had by all. The next night's entertainment was a poolside, kid-friendly movie. We liked the property very much, and the fact that we had a fridge enabled us to pick up some things for breakfast so that the kids weren't starving first thing in the morning (no free breakfast, though they did have room service if you wanted). Now, my pet peeve rant: It seems that almost all properties in the Hotel Circle area charge a daily parking rate. I'm not sure why this is essential for paying guests, and it's something that is a personal issue for me. I find this particularly strange, however, in that Hotel Circle isn't in the city center, or next to one of the many attractions in San Diego. ...it's a bunch of hotels and conference centers and a golf course or two. So, why the parking fees?

Hotel called me about 4o minutes later that room was ready. Able to check into room about 1:45 (vs. 3:00pm). Seemed like a good start. Room seemed ok at first. Starving, we went down to have lunch @2:15 at Postcards Bistro which according to the hotel's website is open for lunch 11AM - 3:00pm. We were told it was closed and did not open until 5:00pm. Staff suggested we go into the poolside bar. ON a Sunday afternoon they were having a \"pool party\" with a very LOUD band. The combination of the smell of freshly applied lacquer on the tacky surfer decor tables and benches and the horrible band that we found unbearably painful to listen to, we left. We asked for a shuttle ride to the San Diego Zoo to have lunch there and spend the rest of the day there. (shuttle is complimentary according to website). No problem except it was weird how the driver kept asking us our room number. Good thing we mentioned our husbands were back at the hotel. Then all seemed well until 9:00pm when the zoo closed because by the way - No shuttle. It stopped at 5:00pm \"because they only had one driver\". Hmmm, too bad for us I guess. So, out $20 for a cab ride back to the hotel. Approached exterior door with note to slide room key card for entry BUT door opened without it...so much for security. Decided to have balcony doors open for fresh air (paid upgrade for the balcony room). Door opened very wide but NO SCREEN to keep out any bugs! And staring right at us all the people at the hotel next door. Plus the rotted and termite eaten wood and peeling paint...another $20 out the window since we didn't use the balcony. Went down for some ice. On way back up bumped into my friend turning on the landing and she bumped the \"railing\" and it almost came off wall! OMG! What a joke! Shower - Ha!! I could stand in between the streams of water or stand directly under it with head against wall for the faucet like flow. In morning no pressure, toilet tank didn't even fill properly and we had to play around with it filling it with water using ice bucket. Before I forget, my friend was congested with sore throat and itchy eyes all night but we didn't know what was affecting her allergies...until the morning. On top of a couple of our items was a vast layer of dust which obviously was coming from the vents where the A/C came out as it went on and off all night. Clearly those ducts need cleaning. Needless to say we were VERY UNHAPPY with the experience at The Handlery in San Diego. Otherwise room was ok for cleanliness. Not very roomy. Not even a chair to sit in except a fancy desk chair which was the place for the big pillows that smelled like other people's heads. Overall we would NEVER consider staying there again and we will NEVER recommend it to anyone. It did not come anywhere near to meeting expectations.

The check-in was great, and the front desk staff was wonderful and very helpful.

We came down from Los Angeles to visit the San Diego zoo before returning to New Zealand. The hotel was not what we expected from looking at their website, not in a bad way, just again not what we were expecting. The service was amazing! The reception staff could not be more helpful and the concierge who's name i have forgotten deserves a medal, as there are no elevators in the hotel and he was kind enough to help us with all 6 of our suitcases which were extremely heavy. He had a \"good morning\" for us each day we were there and was one of the most hard working people i have come across in all of my travels. The location for us was fine but i can see how it may be a problem if you want to see \"downtown San Diego\". The hotel is a little bit out from the central city, next to the freeway. We did not see any buses pass by but there was a shopping mall about 10-15 minutes walk away which had all the necessary shops, cafe's etc and a bus station. I must admit that the hotel was not what i was expecting, to me it seemed more like a motel but without the kitchen amenities. As i mentioned there are no elevators and there are three different blocks of rooms so there is a little walking and lifting involved, not good when you have 6 suitcases. The house keeping was exceptional and the rooms were spotless, however they were a little dated, our toilet lid in the bathroom had obviously broken and instead of replacing it they had reattached it with what looked like putty and superglue. The walls are also quite thin therefore we heard our next door neighbors talking and yelling for most of the second night both in their room and in the hallways. We had room service on the second night, it was delicious but by the time it arrived to us it was almost cold. It was also strange that i tried to order something from the menu and the women proceeded to tell me that it was no longer available. I thought they could have at least updated the in room menu. The breakfast each morning was really nice and again it was the waiters and waitresses who made it great, nothing was too much bother, however half of the breakfast seemed to be buffet and half was order, i.e you could go and get your own yogurt but had to order your toast which meant it took a little while. On the second morning we arrived at about 8, the dining hall was full so we had to sit in he lobby for about 5 minutes and by the time we were seated there was no yogurt etc left.

We had just spent a week in Newport Beach (Hyatt Regency - separate review) and came to what we thought was a centrally located hotel. We didnt pay a vast rate (Virgin holidays UK) so our expectations were not very high and it's a good job they were not. The hotel, I should say motel really, is located near a busy freeway and other cheap hotels/motels. If you choose to use public transport to get into downtown San DIego, should your timings be out it can take over an hour. A bus stops outside the front of the hotel which takes about 8 mins to the Old Town station where you can get on the trolley (tram) into San Diego - 7 stops to Seaport Village. The other alternative is walk the 10-15 mins to Fashion Valley Shoppng Mall where you can get the trolley to Old Town and change. All very tedious and time consuming. The buses only run every 30 mins and after 6 every hour and finish at 8. The staff at times did not know the timings and gave me incorrect information so it took my daughter and I 1 hour 15 mins to get into San Diego. We were very disappointed with the rooms. It had 2 double beds that just about fitted into the room and a tiny bathroom, and very little storage for clothes. There was no safe in the room and no conditioner in the bathroom. We had just spent a week quite easily in a room with the four of us. We couldn't here. We had to pay for an extra room for the week. The only plus was we had a terrace, most rooms did not. Car parking was included in my rate. The pool area was reasonable but lacked sun loungers. I think I counted about 20. If we wanted a drink we had to go to the inside bar to get them. We tried the continental breakfast as it was included in the rate. Little choice of croissants, yoghurt and cereal. You can ask for toast. No ham or cheese. Slow service. We did eat the first night in the bar and this was typical bar food - burgers, sandwiches, fish and chips which was ok. That night Daniel served us and he was the only member of staff who was really helpful. The hotel has a free shuttle bus you can book to go to the zoo or Seaworld in. We used it to the zoo but it only runs during the day so we left without having done the zoo justice. We took the car to Seaworld!! I needed to get somthing from a shop on the way back but the driver would not stop so my daughter and I had to walk the long way round to the shop which although is located just over the freeway, you can't cross it. The bar closed really early - 9.30pm one night so after arriving back at 9.45pm on the Monday and wishing a night cap we couldn't have one. A bar that closes so early in an establishment that calls itself a hotel and resort is ridiculous. Towards the weekend it seemed to stay open longer - 10.30 ish but often no barman was present and 1 night I waited 10 mins until someone could be located to serve me!! We all loved California and can't wait to cross the pond to come back but I certainly won't be staying here again. It's too far out, has too much of a motel feel to it, small rooms that just about accommodate 2 and services that are not available for enough hours in the day", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cWe were treated like royalty on our honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "danceswithjack", "ReviewID": "UR112080611", "Content": "This was my 2nd stay at the Handlery.

PS, this is the only hotel that I have been to that offers guests free tooth brushes. San Diego was great to visit. Imperial Beach looked like it was made of diamonds, and the ocean was made of pearls and sapphires. Some people took their dogs out for walks. The air was between warm, cool, and chilly. There were flowers and trees that I had never seen before. Balboa Park had stunning and artistic buildings to view. The Museum of Man, although it was small and had a few exhibits, contained evidence of the existence of Nefertiti and her family. The Zoo had many creatures, some familiar, some unfamiliar. It had an adoreable black puma or panther that talked a lot. The Cheese Factory and Bchans had tasty food. But, my husband and I never got to eat at these places. These restaurants were packed with people who were dressed like if they were going to a ritsy nightclub. Some people camped out in front of the restaurants. Joes Crab Shack, Chipotles, and Dave/Busters treated us better, had better food, didn't make us wait all day, etc. Most people were nice. There were a few rude ones. At the Cheese Factory, a kid kicked me, and his mother didn't correct him for it. On the roads, a few road hogs cut us off. At a burger joint at Balboa Park, the staff cooked me a tasty cheeseburger, but mostly ignored me, and a few other customers. Every city will contain its good and and bad aspects.

We chose this hotel for it's promotion. The price was unbeatable. I knlew it was an old family hotel so I thought it would be dark or smelly, but when we got there, I was surprised by how clean it is. It is recently renovated. I loved the carpet and that fresh scent. I'm a light sleeper so I requested a quiet room, we got one at the end of the hall far away from the Highway side, with a balcony too. Very quiet, good nights of sleep gave us the energy for long walkings at daytime. And just like all the other comments, the bed was really that comfortable!! I'm very picky about beds but I miss the Handlery bed now! When we get up in the morning, have our breakfast, the Hotel has a shuttle to drive us to the Zoo, Seaworld, Old Town, Fashion Valley and etc. It saved me a lot of money for taxi. I really have to mention the shuttle driver Jeff, he was the nicest guy there and gave us so much help. We went to all the restaurants that he recommanded and we loved them all! One afternoon when we came back, we even received a little gift of treats from Jeff and the front desk staff, how sweet!! (The next day was my birthday so it made me so happy :D) I saw that some people were complaining about there is nothing on Hotel circle except hotels, but you can always walk to Fashion Valley, it's a big mall. We took public transportation everyday, it is very easy. Usually we go out in the morning with the shuttle and take either 120 back from Downtown or the Trolley. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, specially the Concierge, sorry I forgot his name but he helped us with our trips a lot! The pool was so nice, and the Hottub. After a long day of walking in the Zoo and parks, it feels so great to relax in a huge outdoor hottub. I went to Cancun last year and we stayed in a Luxury 4.5 star hotel, but quite honestly, the staying at Handlery is actually happier than that one. I liked the warm \"family\" feeling it gives me. Everyday when we take the bus back to the hotel, I feel like I'm going home :) For those who were complaining about there is too little choices in breakfast, maybe they didn't know they can order Toast, Cereal or Oakmeal from the kitchen, it is included. No one told us that until the 4th day of our staying, lol. There is one Mexican looking waiter, he was very nice and helpful. The other waiter, however, looked at me as if I was stealing when I ordered one more toast in the morning :S. We didn't have a car but the parking seems very convenient, having a car for this city is a wise choice. Wifi was not bad, last time we stayed at Cancun, my bf lost his wallet in the hotel :(. So this time I was kind of worried about bringing my laptop. End up I worried too much, lol, the room service ladies are very nice and professional. Everyday when we get back, everything is cleaned and new shampoo lotions are stocked. Thank you ladies~ I wrote so much, but trust me, you can stay at this place and enjoy your vacation with such a low price. I travel around all the time and I will go back to Handlery Hotel.

Here are the highlights and lowlights: Checkin on Sunday was fast and professional, we wanted to see the Zoo for sure but the shuttle service to the Zoo was full for both days we were visiting. The agent (Erin, I think) offered to comp for a taxi to the Zoo and was going to call our room to confirm but we did not hear back so I was a bit worried, but everything worked out and we did get a cab to the Zoo. The shuttle service for the Trolley Tours also stops right outside the Hotel. Breakfast was good, service was attentive and fast, lots of screaming kids so beware, continental with cereal or oatmeal, which is what we expected. The room was clean, a bit dated, good bed. We used the hot tub only, good temperature. Room service....ugh. We had been shopping at the nearby mall and since no restaurants were within walking distance we ordered room service. The hamburger was $18 so got one to share, when it got to our room 30 mins later it was cold and had no flavor and the fries we cold and soggy, very disappointing.

When I read the reviews about the hotel on this site I was truly expecting a TINY room. I thought for sure we would have to get another room. I was pleasantly surprised when we walked into the room and found it to be quite large. We had 6 (large) suitcases, and 3 carry-ons and still had plenty of room. We even had a roll away bed in there. When I walked down the hall to get ice I looked into a room that the housekeepers were cleaning and it was TINY. We obviously lucked out and got one of the bigger sized rooms. There is no way all 5 of us would have fit into the tiny room that I looked at. Having seen that, I understood where people were coming from that said this hotel was too small for them on this website. Cons: The beds are definitely doubles as the website states. They are not queens. My husband and I are used to sleeping in a king at home, so we really didn't sleep all that comfortably. Also, the beds are not the best I have slept in, but I have slept in much much worse. They won't give you a roll away bed unless you are sleeping in a room with a king size bed. We asked the front desk for one and the housekeepers and both said no. We broke the rules and found a clean one and put it in our room so no one had to sleep on the floor. They do offer cribs for babies, but we had a 2 year old with us. There is no way he was fitting in a crib. I would imagine that if we were staying in one of the tiny rooms the cot would not have fit anyway....so again, we lucked out with the room. The whole breakfast scene was weird. The waiter we had was rude and not helpful whatsoever.The restaurant was not even busy. It was a weekday and there were 4 other people in there with us. When we sat down he didn't even come to our table for the first 5 minutes we were there. Then he came and asked what we wanted to drink. Someone else brought us out our drinks and after that no one came by again. They all stayed in the back by the kitchen. We had the continental breakfast cards and had no idea how to use them. We literally sat there for 10 min until I finally got up and asked the hostess what we were supposed to do. She was nice and told us where the \"buffet\" was. It is quite far from the table and behind a wall, which is odd. I'm still not really sure what comes with your breakfast. They do not offer you toast, or a bagel or cereal (which apparently comes with your meal) you have to ask. So half of the breakfast is buffet style, the other half you have to ask your waiter for. The fresh fruit was nice, but the pastries were mediocre at best. The wait staff (especially the male the helped us, Jose maybe?) could use a course on customer service and more training. They need more ice machines. The closest ice machine was on the other end of the long hall, and down the stairs. There is no fan in the bathroom. It stayed humid in there for hours after we all got done showering. The water pressure was terrible. But expected since it was built in the 1950's. No elevators. As I said we had 6 bags, plus a child and carry-ons so it would have been helpful to have an elevator. The business center is where the internet is. It is NOT free, and it was quite expensive. We did not check in online for our flight because of this. We figured it would cost us at least $9 to print off our tickets. Not worth it. This should be a free amenity. Pros: Our room was at the end of the hall way so we only had one neighbor. It was pretty quiet. We did not hear traffic like past guests have said on the site. Luckily our window was facing the pool, not the road. The walls are very thin and I can see how annoying it would be to have neighbors on both sides of you while hearing traffic outside the window. The Bellhop was very helpful and knowledgeable. He gave us addresses and directions to places that we wanted to go. Also, when we checked out we still had 7 hours before our flight so he took our baggage and held it there for us until we came and got it. Worked out very well for us. The front desk staff was nice and helpful as well. The pool was very nice and clean. I have noticed that sometimes when hotels post pictures of their facilities on the internet, they look nothing like the pictures when you actually show up. This is not the case for the handlery. The pool area was very nice and well kept. The rooms were clean. I'm weird about germs and carpets, but I did not have a problem here. Very clean. The staff around the facility (housekeepers, security, etc) were friendly and always said hi when we walked by. The housekeepers were more than willing to give us towels or whatever we needed. Overall it was a very good experience. I would go back again, but only if I got the same room. I cannot imagine cramming 5 people into one of those small rooms. Unbearable. We went through bookit.com and got a good rate. $78/night. Remember that you are not staying at the Ritz. If you want something extraordinary and elegant, this is not your spot. If you're looking for a place to sleep, hold your luggage, and swim...this is a great choice.", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cKind of like a classic car - You can appreciate it, even with its quirks\u201d", "Author": "Falcarragh13", "ReviewID": "UR103300675", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I would absolutely stay at this hotel again if I were in San Diego. However, I can see why the ratings here are extreme. This is a place you'll either love or hate. The rooms are tiny, but really nicely done. There were four of us - two adults, a 15 year old girl and a 13 year old boy in a room with two doubles, and we were there for four nights (the first two nights my daughter was in a different hotel with a group). There was not a shred of floor space. However, the beds were extremely comfortable and the room was spotless (my wife didn't even give my daughter grief about sitting on the floor while my son was in the shower after we got out of the hot tub one night, and she is usually a bit of a freak about hotel room floors). My wife and daughter did complain that the hair dryer in the room was the worst of any hotel they have stayed in, and it also caused a fuse to blow (which was corrected within minutes). After having read the reviews about the breakfast, I was prepared for the worst. I don't know if it was because our expectations were so low, we were all really happy with it - specifically the fruit - honeydew, cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapple and strawberries. Fresh and non-stop. Saturday morning around 9:00 am, the place was a zoo. We sat in the lounge area. I would guess there were 100 others at the same time. The people working there were moving constantly to keep the fresh fruit coming. The breads/pastries were good, but the fruit was great. They do give you the breakfast coupons at check in. And, they do take their coupons seriously - I think a little too seriously. They have a \"choose ONE of the following\" with the ONE in caps, bolded and underlined - breads, pastries or cereal. Again, having read the reviews, I was afraid the breakfast police might say they saw the remnants of a danish on might plate while I was biting a croissant. They didn't. But, my suggestion to them would be to lose the SCREAMING \"ONE,\" and just make it a free continental breakfast - what's there is there. The location, whether it's this hotel or any of the other hotels on Hotel Circle, was outstanding. Yes, you do have to get in the car to go anywhere. However, you are not in the car for more than a few minutes to any of the main areas. The zoo and Balboa Park is a few minutes. Downtown, Horton Plaza, The Midway Museum, a couple of minutes further. Sea World, a few minute in a different direction. La Jolla, about 15 minutes. Finally, the staff. The previous review praised the hostess in the breakfast area. I think with the volume of people that was there, she may have been getting frustrated when we dealt with her. She was fine with us, but getting short with a woman who did not understand English all that well, raising her voice and telling her to go get a box for takeout. Other than that, the staff was exceptional. Arriving at 1:00 am after a long flight, I did not want to see the pool, but the front desk clerk was that proud of the facilities, he wanted to show me it quickly. And, while the breakfast staff may have been running ragged, they really kept a great attitude. Prior to the economy going south in 2007, we would typically stay at high end hotels - the Ritz Carlton, JW Marriotts. We had to get real with our money and have been mostly Hyatt Place, Fairfields, Courtyards since. This is clearly no Ritz, and it is not nearly as predictable as the chains. But, it's clean, comfortable, the staff is great, and it has a California quirkiness that I would go back to on our next trip.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "prosser", "Title": "\u201cComfortable stay, but . . .\u201d", "Author": "razziProsser", "ReviewID": "UR102858277", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Handlery with my two grown daughters and a four-year-old granddaughter.

He was most disrespectful, particularly to my disabled daughter. Thankfully, another person working in the restaurant (manager?) politely attended to her. The way the \"complimentary breakfast coupons\" are handled could be more polite. When the waiter rudely asks, \"Do you have coupons?\" before they even greet you politely, there is a problem.

It is fantastic! We even called and asked to be picked up early one day and the shuttle was there in about 10 minutes. The shuttle driver is a very nice man. The hotel area is great, only a short walk to a mall and a train. We spent one day riding the train to different areas: seaport village, gaslamp district, and it cost $5 for an all day ticket. The train was very easy and convenient to use. The front desk gave us a map of the train routes. I had read some bad reviews about the free breakfast, but we loved it. The breakfast ticket cards make it seem like you can only pick one item on the card but this is not true. We had delicious fruit every morning, strawberries, and melons. There was yogurt and muffins and you could ask for toast, bagels, english muffins, cereal, and oatmeal. They left a pitcher of coffee on the table for you to help yourself and it was very good coffee. We always looked forward to breakfast.

The hotel restuarant was a little pricey for us (i'm sure it compares with surrounding area prices) so we ate elsewhere. I highly recomend the spaghetti factory in the gaslamp district, really good food and prices! We did have the restuarant pizza one night and it was delicious! I was surprised when we checked out that we had a water fee. I just didn't realize that it cost something, if it had a little tag on it with a price I would have known.

Their response was so quick, professional, and comprehensive that I am booking another stay at the hotel with my spouse next month. The continental breakfast was included in the hotel package, and had a menu price of about $5, so it wasn't that big of a financial deal, but the Desk and the entire staff treated our disappointment like a personal failure. They immediately altered our bill, although we neither asked for this or expected it. They comped us to dinner so that we could, in their words, \"experience the proper dining experience they expect every guest to enjoy.\" The manager came to our table at dinner to check on us, and he was also in the lobby the next morning at checkout to greet us and other guests who were leaving. From this you might conclude that we made a big issue of the breakfast and caused some type of scene and became notorious to the entire staff. Not true. We very quietly explained that their was a shortcoming in one area of out stay, and the remaining experience had been exceptional. Their response was that every guest should have an exceptional experience in every aspect of their stay at the hotel. Wow. They deserve some credit, and some loyalty. I have found my hotel for every trip to San Diego. Finally, their location could not be better. Access by freeway and by surface streets to anywhere you may want to go is perfect. We drove to Coronado twice, and both trips were done in 15 minutes. The Zoo (with which the hotel has a free round-trip shuttle service) is ten minutes away. The only area I gave less than \"5\" to was the rooms. They were fine, but a little crowded, with the bathroom being noticeably small. Cleanliness and quality were fine.

The doors didn't close properly so you had to the slam them (which is great when your neighbour comes home at 1am and has to reef on their door to close it OR when you are using the bathroom in your own room and your spouse is trying to sleep). Really though, not the end of the world. The drain in the bathroom did not work at all, nor did the overflow drain, so the sink was always gross and overflowing. The thing that really got me was the lingering smell. My friend used to call the sulphur smell that water sometimes has \"fart water\". That's the first thing that came to mind for me. It hung around pretty good. I am sure that housekeeping had to have noticed when they cleaned the room every day...surely they ran the water in the sink?

We stayed in one of the superior king rooms in the last building of the hotel. I liked the fact that in order to get in to the building itself you have to use your room key, the downside to that is that the key slot seemed to be faulty in our building so it took a couple tries to get it to open. The room itself was a decent size. What we liked most about it was how amazingly comfortable the bed was. They could use a microwave in the room and maybe a bigger bathroom as it was difficult to have two people getting ready in the tiny bathroom. We stayed for a total of 6 days and the bath products they provided were gone by day 2 but we asked for more and they had someone bring it up while we were out & on that same occasion they took care of a bug we found on the bed side table and reattached the knob in the shower which came out while we bathed. We didn't come across much of the hwy noise that was mentioned in other reviews which was good. The menu at the hotel's restaurant was a bit overpriced so we only ate in once.

The plate comes with french fries but cheese on the burger is an extra $1.50 so make sure to ask for cheese if you want it added. The burgers are a good deal if you find yourself there for MNF. I cannot stress enough how important the location of this hotel was. Its about a 10min walk to Fashion Valley Mall. You can jump on the trolley/bus from there & go just about anywhere in San Diego. There's even a bus stop right in front of the hotel! I would definitely stay at the Handlery again if we get as good a price as we did this past time(booked through Orbitz) .", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good value\u201d", "Author": "gernblanston12345", "ReviewID": "UR85597588", "Content": "Great location in old town.

The location of the hotel was great for us as it was a 5 minute walk to Fashion Valley Mall, which has Macy's, Bloomingdales, Kate Spade etc and a transit stop. We bought a 4 day transit pass for 15 dollars each which allowed us to use the trains and buses and we got around San Diego with no difficulty. Do not miss Coronado Island and Balboa Park - both are beautiful. Rained some at the zoo (buy the 4 dollar poncho) and the zoo is expensive, 37 dollars for a one day pass and this includes rides on the buses and sky-tram, but it is a great zoo.

We're so glad we found this hotel and would definitely stay there again on future San Diego trips. Having had a terrible experience at the Town & Country (admittedly quite a few years ago, perhaps it has improved since then), we were searching for an alternative nearby. While perusing google maps, we discovered an icon for the Handlery just a block away from the T&C. Based on the Handlery's website - and tripadvisor reviews of course as well - we decided to take give them a try. Wow, are we glad we did! They have some of the nicest housekeeping staff we've ever encountered and the room was always spotless when we returned in the evening. The front desk staff were super-efficient at check-in (much appreciated after a long and tiring trip due to airline delays) as well as helpful when it came to printing out boarding passes (they offered to do it for us). Our room, as requested, was on an upper floor, far from the pool and road, comfortable and quiet. It was very handy to have the mini-fridge in the room to keep some sodas and snacks chilled; the large closet was nice. The bathroom isn't huge but it's sufficient. The only two minor comments we have: it would be useful if there were a handtowel holder somewhere in the bathroom as well as a makeup (magnifying) mirror. The landscaping around the property is just beautiful and impeccably maintained, with lovely flowers and plants situated in all sorts of corners. The hotel's location was perfect for us: an easy walk to the Town & Country Conventon Center as well as Fashion Valley Mall (googlemaps indicates it's about 0.5 mile). There's a transit center at the mall as well, with both busses and the trolley. As we did not rent a car, we used the public transportation quite a bit to see some of the San Diego highlights (Hillcrest neighborhood, Balboa Park, Harbor Drive, Little Italy, Gaslamp, Downtown San Diego). A general San Diego travel tip: we discovered that there's a Water Taxi service which will come to pick you up where ever you are along the harbor. You just give them a call to let them know where to pick you up. We took it from near the Seaport Village over to the Hotel del Coronado, then walked back through Coronado to the Ferry Landing to catch the ferry back to San Diego.

He helped make our holiday so enjoyable & has a few recommendations for restauants etc (Jeff - thanks for the \"Little Piggies\"restaurant recommendaiton on Coronado Island - we seriously pigged out!!) (Ryan's also a great & helpful guy who drives when Jeff's off). We'd also like to thank, one of the hotel's managers, Sandra. After returning from a fishing trip I'd hoped to have my catch cooked but understandably food hygiene rules did not allow the chef to do this. Sandra organised a cook out pack for us with tin foil, olive oil, lemon etc - how thoughful & such a nice touch!! We had a great cook out at Mission beach!! With regard ot the room this was very clean & comfortable - lovely bed! We hardly spent any time in the room! You'll find the facilities are very good. The pool was very well kept & I reckon this is the sign of quality hotel (poolside rest rooms were also very clean - as were the others we used). Poolside entertainment was fun & the bar there was a gathering point for all visitors. I used the gym which was small but had good equipment! The shop sells breakfast stuff, rolls, salads drinks etc. In addition Jeff suggested we visit the on site ticket agency who booked us great seats at the Padres base ball. The hotel is well located for all of San Diego's best attractions. We ate a lot at Fashion Valley (including breakfast). Hotel was a little pricey on food & not unusually for the US I guess we ate out all the time. You can hire a car at Enterprise in the hotel.

The location for Sea World and San Diego can't be beat. Negatives: The room is SMALL. If you have more than 3 travelling, it is cramped. The bathroom is even smaller. Although it looks like the hotel room was redone, the bathroom needed more work as the tub was old and the grouting was moldy near the bottom. Plus, the shower didn't drain.

We looked at the sight on the net and said, I don't think so, but she was adamant that it was an icon. Peoples perceptions of \"icons\" are very different obviously. We arrived at the Handlery, and we confirmed we wanted a smoking room, and the guy said \"no problems\" and put us at the very back section of the lines of rooms (long distance from anything). We walked all the way down there to discover, that there arent any smoking rooms, just rooms with balconies, which is absolutely fine, however, he gave us a room without a balconey, it is quite easy to work out too, the upstairs rooms have balconies, and the downstairs ones dont. So he was obviously just being a pain. So we walked all the way back to reception to be given an upstairs room. The front section of the rooms are nice and surround the pool, however once you go past these, they are prison type looking places, green wooden rooms, inside is much nicer, however outside is extremely dated more like the Bates Hotel in Physco. After we unpacked we noticed that the bed smelt of dog, we rang reception and they sent out staff to change the bedding. We then went out to discover San Diego, and returned tired and went to order room service, we noticed that the menu was very limited, i.e. sandwiches mainly, we ordered rec\\luctuntly x 2 sandwhiches as we were tired and hungry, Next morning we walk up to have breakfast only to discover (after paying) that the staff were trying to cook on what looked like bunson burners, apparently the kitchen was under renovation, they neglicted to inform us of this. Had a nice day at Sea World and then returned to room to discover toilet was over flowing, rang reception yet again and they said that they would send someone, we waited an hour and rang again and someone was there within a few minutes, the repair man attended with towels to clean up the mess! All we could think of was thank goodness we were leaving the next day or we might have received those towels for showering! Where the Flight Centre really pushed the Handlery, I can only imagine that they were getting kick backs because the only place that we discovered heaps of Australians staying at the same place, and yes upon speaking with them, were not happy with the Handlery either, and yes had booked thru Flight Centre.

We've had to pay deposits before but felt that this was excessive, especially considering we had no warning prior to travel and our room had been paid for in full.

They printed out mapquest directions each day before we drove anywhere, recommended sights and activities very accurately (Old Town truly was a little lame and the trolley tour was well worth the price).

It was a bit rushed since we wanted to explore Seaworld more, but overall the free ride was worth it (otherwise would have costed about $15-$20 in taxis) - Very close to the Fashion Valley mall - the hotel is about a 10 minute walk. My bf and I walked there twice to grab dinner at the Cheesecake cafe and then go shopping. Great stores and fairly upscale - Nieman Marcus, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, JCPenney, Macy's, Abercrombie etc. (stuff us Canadians do not have in our malls) - The room was clean, towels were clean and the room had all the amenities we needed (fridge, hairdryer - however, they do not provide an iron) - we got a pool view and it was fairly quiet. Do not get a room by the highway. - Buy bottled water in the little souvenir shop in the main floor. This is better priced that buying water outside. - Pool is very clean.

Options for getting around also include taking the bus (which is $5 for all day pass).

Cons: - The breakfast was overpriced. There isn't anywhere else to grab breakfast aruond the hotel so we had to eat at the Postcards for $14 each per dish and it was good, however too expensive. They usually had the buffet breakfast but on the day we were there, for some reason, they did not offer it. A bowl of cereal was like $6 or something! - We booked a King room in advance.

This hotel does seem to be a popular place for weddings and we did have an issue when a noisey wedding party were put in a room next to us and made as much noise as they could with there drinking (and other things). We didn't hesitate to complain by phone and security were on the case right away,(although it did start up again once they had left.)I complained again in the morning and as compensation was given free breakfasts for the remainder of the stay and had the $12 per day parking fees wiped from the bill ($168 in all). Overall , yes a good hotel and would recommend anyone to stay but bear in mind it is a 3* hotel and may not have all the facilities you are looking for. If you want posh then stay at the Marriot or Hyatt .", "Date": "April 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales,UK", "Title": "\u201cAn 'OK' experience\u201d", "Author": "1ballerina", "ReviewID": "UR15016300", "Content": "We stayed here for four nights with our 9yr old daughter from 2nd -6th April.

Upon arriving we were put in Building 4 which is very close to the Motorway and were not impressed slightly. The rooms in Building 4 were smelly, old, no balcony, noisy and mouldy and looked nothing like the photo's on their website, or in the travel agents book. We could not stand these rooms so we went back to the front desk and asked to speak to Michael, the reservations manager. After complaining to Michael we were moved to Building 1 which overlooks the pool and spa area and are away from the Motorway. These rooms were what we were expecting, but I think they cost a bit more, so it is worth paying a bit extra to stay in these nicer, quieter rooms. The staff in general were very helpful, apart from Jose, the guy on the front desk when we turned up - he was a bit abrupt, and we felt he didn't really care if we stayed there or not. Once we had moved, our stay was good. The hotel itself is not located close to anything at all, so we had to eat at Postcards, or order in. In saying that, Postcards is a really nice place to eat. We had two evening meals, and two breakfasts there and found the food very nice, great service but a bit expensive - $140 for 4 people. They have a gift shop which sold water, chocolates, etc which was handy as there was nothing else around the hotel, except other hotels! It rained for 3 of our 4 days at San Diego but we still used the pool and spa and they were both heated and very nice to relax in. My husband and I ordered poolside bar service and enjoyed the spa each nite. They have a free shuttle service to both San Diego Zoo and Seaworld which we used. Just remember to book the day before as they fill the early shuttle runs quickly and you will need to order a taxi which we had to do to the Zoo one morning as we left it too late. Checkin was a bit slow, we had to wait until 4.00pm for the first horrible room and there isn't much to do around the hotel if you have to wait. We went to Fashion Valley Mall which is walking distance, but this was just an overpriced labels mall which we found all over California, so nothing special.

But I digress. As for the Handlery itself? Overall, this is a nice enough place to stay. The reception, bar and restaurant are all well decorated and welcoming. And the food at the restaurant is excellent - we dined there twice in our four evening stay and have nothing but praise for the standard of food. The corridors to the rooms and the rooms themselves could do with a lick of paint to brighten them up - but that said, we found the bed comfortable enough and the facilities were good (no room safe though - something of an oversight). The pool area is excellent - one of the best we've enjoyed. The sunbeds were better than the ones at the MGM and I think the pool was better as well... and the hot tub really is hot! I would ask the management to ensure that the key-pass activated doors at the bottom of the stairs genuinely lock - coming back to our room. we were less than pleased to see that a pizza company had free rein to wander the corridors, slipping advertisements under the door. Other than that? A nice touch is the hotel shuttle - we took this to the Zoo and were also picked up at the end of our time there. The staff were all friendly and helpful - special praise to Manny, who, if he didn't know something, made sure he found out for you. It would have been good if a proper map of the trolley routes was available in reception, the one there was very much a 'tourist one' and had to be read in conjunction with other maps to make sense of it. Overall opinion of the Handlery? It is a nice enough place to stay - but they do need to make people more aware of the local transportation options (this is a hotel very much geared up towards the driver).

We got a parking space almost by the door, it was quiet, and we were able to rest without noise from the pool area. On the sunday prior to returning home my wife was taken poorly with a possible urine infection. The staff on the sesk on the SUNDAY morning were great helping find a local hospital, contacting them and heloping me with directions etc. Then the Thursday at 2am I was struck with Kidney Stones and my wife had to get an ambulance, the Staff reacted quickly and efficently. They got their act together and asked if we needed someone to watch the children (aged 3 & 8) for us, but we had another family member with us ans she was able to watch them. A Member of staff came to the room and was genuinely concerned. My only complaint was not about the hotel or staff (well not directly), it is about the large group that were having a family gathering at the hotel for a few night. Their coach was parked out front (not badly) but on two nights when I took my son to the pool to teach him to swim better, they had taken over. Loud rap music and food eating all over the place. The breakpoint for me was when a few of the older children tried to gang up on my son. MISTAKE, fo a man from South London I didn't put up with it. When the family gathering started shouting about the food and began throwing their fried chicken across the pool area to each other we called it a night. Might have been nice that a member of staff had kept a watch over the pool on these nights. Yes it's by the I-8 Freeway, but you hardly notice it. The freeway is an asset in my book, as you can get on it and then on to the I-5 to go North or South. The Fashion Valley Mall is round the corner not miles but enough for a walk, not the greatest mall but it works. Over the small bright over the freeway to Taylor Street and you are in Old Town. Up Friars and you are almost at seaworld. GREAT location too. On Firars is Dennys which was our usual breakfast place. But The Postcards resturant has improved from 2001 and we had a couple of breakfasts there.

The pool was the best of our 3.5 week vacation, long enough to swim in & a decent depth one side whilst safe on the other. Lots a seating around the pool & a good area for sunbathing most of the day. The location is ideal for most attractions that San Diego has to offer, Seaworld, Zoo & Old Town although Wildlife Safari Park was 25 miles away, about 40 minutes. There is a mall only 5 mins away, Fashion Valley, with some great designer shops if that's your want. A great place to eat is \"the cheescake factory\" also located at fashion valley but be prepared to wait & waddle out. The food is of large proportions & not too expensive.

It certainly isn't the fanciest of places, but as we were just looking for somewhere clean and comfortable to rest our heads every night, it worked fine. At check in, we were offered a room either in the third or fourth block; we chose the fourth because that room had a balcony, and we were pleased with the choice. The view from the balcony wasn't fantastic (it looked out over the swimming pool of the hotel from next door!), but it's a nice place to sit and relax, and the hotel is compact enough that the walk from the end block to the lobby only takes a minute. We were actually quite surprised at how nice the room was; it was basic, but decent-sized with really pretty decor and probably the nicest bathroom of the six hotels we stayed in during our trip to the States. As for the location of the hotel-we didn't have a car, but it's only a ten minute walk to Fashion Valley Mall (via a well-lit road, past a golf course and convention centre, which we had no problems walking down late at night) where you can get the San Diego Trolley. You do have to change trains at Old Town to get into Downtown, but the journey generally only takes around fifteen minutes. Fashion Valley Mall was also a really great place to spend our evenings, with a big cinema, and plenty of restaurants and shops to keep us occupied. The hotel shuttle is really handy, getting us to the park in time for opening, and then picking us up promptly at closing time, though it is quite small, so I would recommend booking your seats at check in. My one real complaint about the hotel would be the tour desk; on check in, we mentioned that we were interested in doing a trip to Tijuana, and we were told about a tour where we would be given a tour of the city and then dropped off for two hours shopping before returning to the hotel at about 2pm. We only wanted a half-day trip, as we were planning on spending the afternoon at Coronardo, and this sounded good, so we booked it. However, on the day of the tour, about halfway to Tijuana, we were told that it was a day long trip, and we wouldn't be returning to the hotel until 5pm. This really irritated us, as there is simply not enough to do in Tijuana to spend a whole day there, and we felt like an afternoon of our time in San Diego had been wasted. So if you book a tour, make sure you find out exactly what you're getting! We also didn't think too much of the restaurant-we ate there once for breakfast, and thought it was a bit too expensive (the food was really quite bland), with slightly rude and inattentive staff. It really didn't have the same feeling as the rest of the hotel, where the staff made an effort to create a very friendly atmosphere. If we were to return to San Diego on a similar budget, we would definately consider staying in the Handlery again; it may not have been the best hotel we've ever stayed in, but in general we had no problems, and we would certainly have no complaints about a second stay.", "Date": "February 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWorked fine\u201d", "Author": "MamaofEnS", "ReviewID": "UR6305479", "Content": "We stayed here while my oldest daughter was at a gymnastics meet at the Town and Country next door.

Passers by could look into our room when ever we had the curtains open, which bothered my husband a lot. Around 5:00 am, the alarm clock in the room next door went off with an annoying beeping.

All of the linens were clean as I checked all of them before I used them.The heating also worked well and I'm glad it did as I was running 9 hours late and it was cold when I hit San Diego at 4.45am one foggy morning. I didn't notice excess noise - maybe because I'm from the city and it wasn't any worse than what I'm used to. There was even a wedding on while I was there and there wasn't excessive noise. I couldn't vouch for the pool or washing machines as I didn't have time to swim and I hand washed my clothes. I was also glad to see that each building had a lock on the door that needed a card to open. Important for a solo traveller like myself. I did eat at the restaurant - the dinner was great, though for a budget traveller a little pricey. (Though on my next trip I will eat here again - the food is incredibly fresh and tasty). I bought breakfast from the souvenir shop and the lady there was nice. I also found the rest of the staff quite nice and they answered all of my questions. I am diffinately staying here again. It has everything I need and nothing I don't. I refusing paying premium prices for things I don't need or use. I am looking at doing another 4 nights here in October.", "Date": "February 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat price, but don't expect quiet!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4413669", "Content": "If you are after a full nights sleep, then this hotel is NOT for you!

The group as a whole likes to stay at budget hotels so this review isn't based on expecting a four or five star resort. First point, calling the Handlery a resort is marketing at best. The hotel is a 1950's style motor court that looks like it was last updated in the mid 1970's. I made my reservation on the internet. When I checked in they couldn't find my reservation. They kind of winced when I told themI booked on the internet so they must have recuring problems with that system. I had a printed reservation confirmation so I gave that to clerk to assist. It didn't help. The young lady at the front desk told me that I made a mistake in booking the wrong date, was charged a no show and that was the reason why they couldn't find my reservation. But she said at that point everything was fine. I asked for the confirmation back the check for myself and as I suspected, I had booked the correct dates. I later checked with my credit card company to see if they had charged me with a no show and they had not so the front desk clerk had totally lied to my face to cover their mistake. So they put me in first floor room that had two double beds, which would have been fine except that I had reserved a king. So back over to the front desk I went. The clerk (different one this time) moved me to a different room with a king. We wake the next morning to find that the pipes had backed up into the sink in the bathroom and left a deposit of rust and god knows what else. If we were not with a group we would have sought another hotel close by but we didn't have much of a choice without a major pain going from one hotel to stay and another for meetings. Other than the first front desk clerk who lied to me the other staff were friendly and tried to help but obviously have very little to work with.

There are no elevators in the building and you have to carry your luggage to the room up stairs. Iam sure in it's hay day it was upscale but it needs some remodeling.

The hotel is on a huge parcel of land with three lots of two storey units so no lifts to carry bags to the upper level. The room had a balcony but ours overlooked the pool pumps so some noise was evident 24 hours a day.

Our family of 5 loved it. The room was a tad small for the rollaway cot but we made it work. I did tons of research before we left because we are a family of 5 ( 3 kids - 7, 15,18) and I work at a travel agency so my family expected me to get the best I could to fit our budget. They were impressed. I had wanted to get a hotel on the beach because it would add to our 'California Experience\" but we really didn't have any extra time to spend on a beach, and for the price of a beach hotel we were able to rent a car and drive to Anaheim and see beaches there. Our patio was a great extension of our room, but a screen door would have been nice so we could leave it open nat night. Our view was ugly ( the roof around us) but we didn't really spend much time in our room. There was a small fridge and no microwave so making food in our room was not really an option. Internet is available - at a cost of $10 per day. The location of the hotel was perfect. In hotel circle, right at a City Trolley Tour stop ( we highly recommend taking the tour, it is a great way to see all of San Diego and the land/sea tour was great!). The hotel has a shuttle to Sea World, the return shuttle was at 4:30 and the park was open until 6, so we caught a cab back to the hotel and it only cost $7. The pool and hot tub were very nice. The restaurant has a great breakfast buffet although it is a bit pricey. From here we went to Anaheim and stayed at the Best Western Park Inn and Suites.

If you happen to get an outside room in block four beware, there is major building work going on over the fence ! Our room however was a good size and had everything we needed.

It may have been nice when it was built circa 1960 but the bad paint job and re-stucco fall short of any sort of renovation. The pool area is tacky and the gym has 20 year old Nautilus machines.
