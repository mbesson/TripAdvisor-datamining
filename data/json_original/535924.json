{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Tolerable I used this hotel for one night for an unscheduled airport delay. It was only 10 minutes from the airport and only 15 minitues taxi to city center (excluding rush hour). The room was satisfactory and the food ok. The hotel information has very little English so I missed breakfast. The staff has enough English if you ask questions. I could not get the phone to direct dial out.Overall, satisfactory but a bit short of 4 star.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR167422783", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "wibrew"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d535924-r6447414-Jinglin_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "535924", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
