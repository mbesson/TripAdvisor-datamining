I have stayed at the Locanda Ca'Zose 5 times including July and August of 2011 with different family members (husband, niece, sister and family). Perhaps this review will assist in illustrating why I will continue to come back again and again. The Hotel: A small, comfortable family-owned hotel in a 17th C. building in the Dorsoduro neighborhood, the rooms are charmingly Venetian in style - clean, maintained, comfortable beds, efficient airconditioning, pretty bathrooms, a safe and a television which could benefit from a channel selection guide and user directions. Regarding the three room in which I have stayed: one overlooked a courtyard and roofs, one had 17 century beams, and the other had a beautiful view of the small bridge and canal near the hotel. The breakfast room is small and intimate with an excellent selection of Continental breakfast items to get a visitor going in the morning: cappuccino/coffee/tea/water/juices/milk and cereal/granola, yogurts, hard-boiled eggs, bread for toast, pasteries, cheese and jams. The Staff: The sisters, Graziella and Valentina assist their guests in making their stay at the hotel and Venice pleasant; helping with questions about transportation, connections, event venues, and other things of interest. The 24 hour front desk staff speaks English and perhaps other languages of which I am not aware. Suggestion: it is best not to wait until the very last minute to inquire about the bill, since some staff members may need to refer you to one of the sisters who may not be present at that time. The Location: Dorsoduro! A true neighborhood! Walk 5 minutes, just 3 blocks to the vaparetto stop Santa Maria della Salute (water bus with connections to San Marco, the islands of Lido, Murano, Buranoand towards the Rialto bridge and market, the train station and Piazzale Roma area); walk 3 minutes, 1/4 block to the traghetto (gondola crossing the Grand Canal for a small fee), walk 5 minutes to the P. Guggenheim Collection, 10 minutes to Accademia and bridge; walk 15 minutes to Campo San Barnaba to an interesting display of Leonardo da Vinci inventions, and there are many excellent restaurants and shops. Note: I recommend the plastic-coated map Streetwise Venice (online and bookstores) - I also use Artwise Venice, Streetwise and Artwise Rome, Streetwise and Artwise Florence, Streetwise Milan, Streetwise Naples and Vicinity. I can actually say that I have never been lost in Venice (but I have never been there in fog - just clear weather) thanks to that map. I hope this has helped and good traveling...Susana", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201c5 very good days and nights in Locanda Ca' Zose, Venezia\u201d", "Author": "steenkrarup", "ReviewID": "UR122108229", "Content": "From 10th to 15th of November 2011, both days included, I stayed in Locanda Ca' Zose, Venezia, with my friends Richard Page Leroy-Cruce, Lisbeth Ryge and Ole Schjoerer.

In part, it had a room available when we wanted, and it also sounded well-located. There were many positive reviews on it, too. We arrived there in late May, 2011, in the shoulder-season when the whole world descends on Venice to enjoy the weather. I can see why. It was very lovely, with sunny days, early morning drifting clouds, a gentle breeze, and warm for walking around and when standing in the sun. Ca' Zose is a small place. When we first arrived late in the evening after driving all day from Munich, as we got off the Vaporetto at Salute' stop, it was an act of faith to start dragging our luggage through the narrow (did I say narrow?) walkways between buildings and hope we would pop out of the maze at the front door of our hotel. It turned out to be very direct and easy to find, although we walked by it the first time. The address numbering system is not clear. Check-in was easy and the staff person spoke enough English to make us feel welcome and understood. We had called ahead while still driving to Venice because road construction from Munich had eaten up several hours and we were worried our room might be let go. The host assured us they were expecting us and not to worry. Our room was on the 2nd or 3rd floor, up a narrow, steep, and winding stairway. When we opened our room door, we weren't sure what we had gotten into. It was quite a small room, and the view out the windows was the window shutters of the building across the walkway we had just been on. Happily our windows also had outside shutters that allowed airflow, eliminated light, and minimized sounds from people walking down below. We discovered that it is an out-of-the-way location and foot-traffic, hence noise, was never a problem for us. The room turned out to be quite comfortable. No internet of any kind in the room, but available via wifi in the lobby for a fee. The place was clean, nicely appointed although a bit funky. Tap water is drinkable and Venetians are quite proud of the \"Mayor's Water\", which comes via pipe from the mainland down from the Alps. Breakfast was a nice surprise and we felt it gave us a good start on the day. We discovered the Peggy Guggenheim art museum about 5 minutes walking distance. It is a must see and gives a tremendous appreciation of her influence in the world of art and of her love for this jewel of a city. There are numerous restaurants and bars within easy walking distance, without having to resort to water buses or bridge-crossings. We found this hotel to be nicely situated for everything we wanted to do and see. The last day we splurged for a gondola ride (100 euros!! Beware, the prices go up into the evening) and were delivered to a dock close to the Ca' Zose. Overall, we wouldn't hesitate to go back to the Ca' Zose. When we checked out, the person at the desk was one of the sister-owners. She told us the history of the hotel and their hopes and dreams for the place. I'd say they have done a lovely job of making a small, boutique hotel in a quiet location, yet well placed for easy access (although, in a city the size of Venice, no place is very far away anyway!) As an after-comment, my wife had gotten sick in Greece just prior to coming to Italy. We had to extract a day from the Italian portion of our trip and chose to take it from the Florence part, not Venice. The hotel easily managed our adding that day while subtracting one from the front end of the visit at no charge. We were so happy to have had our full stay in Venice and enjoyed it so much more than Florence.

The location of the hotel is prime. It is in a very quiet area very near the Peggy Guggenheim museum. There are plenty of shops and quaint restaurants in the area as well. The hotel is very pretty. When we arrived our room was not ready. They told us it was ready, but when we entered, it had empty, unwashed glasses from the previous guests and a few other items that needed tending. Later we found trash cans that were not emptied either. But the room was rather nice, small, but that's expected in Italy. My husband decided to take a quick shower while I repacked our suitcases to make room for more souvenirs. I finished and grabbed a book and nestled onto the bed to read. The room was very hot and stuffy. The fan in the room didn't do much to help out, but it was all we had so we spent as much time as possible in the city, and that's what you do when you're in Venice. My husband stood in the bathroom door and asked me what happened to my feet. I looked at the bottom of my white socks and found them covered in dirt and dust. He made me bring him his shoes before he would leave the bathroom. The rug in our room was a mess. It hadn't been properly cleaned in forever, so we spent our time in our room with our shoes on so as not to let our feet touch the floor. I didn't see any mold in the shower, but then again I really didn't look for it. I wouldn't stay here again, because of the dirty carpet which had hair, dust balls in the corners and even a few bugs. My husband was brave enough to look under the bed, but I told him, not to tell me anything, just get in the bed. Soap and water and a good vacuum cleaner are cheap and easy to use. Dirt, dust, hair and bugs on the carpet in a hotel is inexcusable. A hotel cannot be unclean or you won't keep guests coming back. No problems with staff, but they did seem happy in the mornings. We didn't eat breakfast there, so I cannot comment on the food, but I didn't want to eat there because of the condition of the room. We only stayed two nights, but that was enough.

We overcame that by supplementing breakfast at the local bar and/or pizza stall (I'm not a fast food fan but these pizza's are very authentic and more-ish). The room at Ca Zose was good however, and the location is pretty much perfect with quieter evenings of strolling around but yet close to all the razamatazz of St Marks when needed. The proximity to the fab Peggy Guggenheim art museum and the Accademia was a plus. We found Venetians to be somewhat arrogant on the whole but with a few great exceptions, normally the younger variety. Four days was almost enough and a week would be too long unless you are a Venetian fanatic. Murano was a tad too dull and the glass museum there has missed a great chance to provide a superb 'wow!' factor. Frankly I think there are better glass shops on the main island of Venice - with some remarkable pieces of art therein. Vivaldi's Four Seasons in the church at San Vidal is a must - even for non-classical musico's. Here's a great tip - definitely take a shared taxi back to the airport. It's not expensive - around 27 Euros - and the trip goes through several otherwise unexplored canals and then a hair-flying, high speed dash across the lagoon.

My only complaint is that the bed was very hard. I'm not used to sleeping on such a hard bed, and after three nights, my back was growing tired. If you're looking for a nice romantic quiet restaurant in Venice, try Sempione (near San Marco). Valentina (one of the owners of the hotel) made reservations for us one evening (she knows Luigi, the owner of the restaurant). Make sure to reserve a table next to the window!! It opens up on the canal and you're at eye-level with the gondeliers rowing by! Very cute! My fiance proposed there and the setting was absolutely perfect! : ) Another great restaurant (not on a canal but still has a romantic outdoor setting) is Locanda Montin, which is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

Other guests staying in the other side of the hotel reported their rooms were absolutely quiet at night. Our only reservation was the sparseness of the bedding--one small pillow each seems too little after one is accustomed to two. Also the mattress was firmer than you'd expect in a place like this--too firm for me and I like a firm mattress. The managment might have been happy to supply extra pillows but I never got around to asking, happy as I was in the place.

Locanda Ca Zose was a pleasant relief from both those problems. The room was very affordable, relatively speaking, and we felt it was a good value for the money. We paid approx. 185E per night (cash price) for three nights, and our room was very large. In addition to our double bed there was a separate twin which we used for storing luggage, but could easily have accommodated a third person. We also had a small sitting area with a table and 2 chairs, as well as a desk with a hidden minifridge in the cabinet. The bathroom was average size for Europe, which means fairly compact by American standards, but it was clean and well-maintained, and the fixtures were nice. Our room looked over the calle in front of the hotel, not the canal, but I don't see how a canal view would be better. Because there are mosquitoes in Venice most of the year (which the hotel staff warned us about!) you MUST keep windows closed from late evening through morning, so there would not be much opportunity to enjoy a canal view. Breakfast was adequate but not great. The coffee / cappuccino was good, but everything else was pre-packed (pastries, yogurt, jams). We would have liked to have eggs or cold cuts in addition to what was offered. But the available items were presented nicely and staff was very prompt in delivering coffee and other beverages. The hotel staff was very accommodating, and it was a nice bonus to find, at this price, a location where the front desk was staffed 24 hours each day. The hotel helpfully arranged a very early morning water taxi to the airport, which arrived on time and picked us up directly outside the hotel. It's expensive (100E) but necessary for early morning flights, and the hotel made it convenient for us. The location in Dorsoduro is just fantastic. Within easy walking distance are major sights like the Salute, Accademia, and Ca'Rezzonico, as well as the San Marco area, but Dorsoduro feels \"off the beaten path\" and authentically Venetian. Being close to the Peggy Guggenheim collection and the Accademia Gallery means that the area around the hotel is home to a number of stores selling high quality paintings, prints and glass sculptures. The restaurants and bars are generally more affordable than the locations that surround Rialto or San Marco, but of course nothing is Venice is cheap.

The owners gave us some great restaurant tips and walking tour tips. The nite staff was pleasant and hospitable. As far as reviews go regarding lack of mirrors, small shower stalls and flat pillows, we didn't notice and we can call ourselves well-travelled. When visiting Venice, realize many buildings, now hotels, were built 500+ years ago. Space was and is at a premium and people were smaller. Italians fit in standard shower stalls as do weight and height proportionate people of all nationalities. Breakfast was standard fare for Italian hotels.

A word of advice to managment: YOU are doing more harm than good...Your responses are somewhat rude and reiterating what others have said. Whew, glad I got that over. Having said that....Venice is a VERY expensive place to stay. We booked this hotel based on value. That is what we got. Value...No frills. This was our third hotel while in Italy, the most expensvie one and at the bottom of our three. Again, Venice = Expensive. You get what you pay for. The entry is unimpressive, but who really cares about an entry. There isn't an elevator, but we are young fit people, so that didn't matter much either. The stairwell and hallways are dark and narrow, but welcome to Venice! We paid extra for the canal view, and glad we did. It gave us some extra light into the room and a lovely view. The room was clean and large enough for my husband and I. I didn't like we only had one mirror in the entire room and that was in the bathroom. While my husband was getting ready in the bathroom, I had to use a compact makeup mirror that i brought. Is an extra mirror that much? There was room on the wall over the desk, come on! The bathroom TINY. I mean TINY. The shower is almost hysterical; you can barely turn around and your arms hit the side of the shower everyime you move! But, in defense, the shower we had in Rome was the same size...So it must be an Italy thing...But the bathroom itself is still too small. If you are even a slightly larger person, book the room with a larger shower (they have one with a tub/shower). There was mold in our shower, but I just closed my eyes and hurried up. What harm can a little mold do? Right? The breakfast is just awful (the worst in our three hotels)..Toast , yogurt, and cereal. Plan to grab a bite somewhere else. OK, so if you are looking for a somewhat clean, comfy, affordable place to stay, then this is it. Expect nothing more.

It's deep in the heart of Dorsoduro, close to two vaporetto stops, a 3 minute walk from the Accademia bridge and near a really quaint little canal. It's well away from the hustle and bustle of Saint Marks and makes a perfect home base for exploring all corners of Venice. (I really can't imagine staying near St Marks, I think I would have gone nuts). The remaining details of the hotel were about average. The breakfasts did the trick but weren't all that good. Two of the three women we dealt with who worked there were friendly and helpful, while the older woman was a bit rude. The night and cleaning staff were friendly. The room was cute and on the small side (to be expected at this price point) but the bed wasn't all that comfortable. The view was of nothing, but we knew going in we didn't have a canal side room. And the bad-- The pillows are absolutely terrible, some of the worts we've ever slept on. When we asked for a second set, they brought two more of the same type, so it's likely that's all they have. The worst part though was the shower stall. I'm used to tight showers in Europe, but this took the cake. It was the smallest shower bay I've ever had the displeasure of squeezing into. My elbows were constantly hitting the sides and it was just about impossible to bend down. My wife and I had constant laughs about me squeezing in each day. I'm not the biggest guy so if anyone heavy is thinking of staying here, I'd make darn sure you're getting a room with a bigger shower (if there is one).

Only suggestion for the Locanda could be perhaps more excursion brochures could be stocked (they ran out when I was there, but no big deal since I could get around, doing sightseeing easily on my own). And maybe a small water dispenser for guests near reception will truly complete the wonderful experience. A fantastic way to wrap up my maiden trip to Europe as a single female traveller!
