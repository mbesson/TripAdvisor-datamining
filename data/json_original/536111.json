Besides that you cannot change your booking without loosing your upfront payed money. Besides that you have to squeeze yourself through the tiny Lobby. Besides that the food is incredibly bad. Besides that your neighbors will keep you up all night because they went to one of the nightclubs downstairs or the beer-room upstairs and they are drunken and bring girls. Besides all that - they have the unfriendliest guy at the reception I have ever met. It's even a challenge, I sort of motivate you to go there and experiennce this kind of 'anti-attraction'.

(I should not even call it a hotel, its a logde or guest house). I never book hotel without looking over the Internet, but we had a stopover at Dubai Airport for 14 hours and we decided to go out. For Visa they need a confirmed Hotel booking (Basically a way to charge you) The Arabian Adventure Travel agents at the Airport charged us USD 130 for this hotel, they told us its very nice hotel close to the City Centre. Looking at the Price, I thought it better be good. But we were Shocked when we checked-in, the room was 10ft x 10 ft, dirty linen looks like they bought it in second hand market in 1991. The bathroom was stinking, the pillows were non-existent, we somehow managed to take bath and get out of the place. The staff was rude, they kept us waiting at the lobby for airport drop and told me if I am in hurry I should take a Cab and not wait for them. Another Iranian couple with us was struggling with them for their luggage stored in Clock room.

The workers are kind but some hardly undrestand english which is not good for a hotel. Thats it for now, but do take my advise ! DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL !
