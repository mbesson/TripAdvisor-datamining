My friend and I paid about $269 per night + taxes of course, so $300 per night. Room was two double beds harbor view.

IF you don't need or use a handicap room then the following won't apply to you. I wish there had been more handicap bars in the shower area. This roll in shower had a small flexible lip that helped contain water but design in all hotels we stay in water still gets everywhere. Why aren't the shower curtains to the floor?That 2-3 inch gap only allows water to get everywhere. The floors in handicap bathrooms are always slick and not good for somebody with mobility issues. I wish there were a fold down seat for the vanity area like there is in the shower. My husband needs to sit when brushing his teeth, etc. We always have to drag in the office chair from the desk for him to sit on. Luckily the beds in this room were the perfect height.

The only real downside to this hotel is the 700 Grille, the main restaurant in the lobby. The food is not great and is very overpriced. There are many much better choices just steps away in the Inner Harbor or the adjacent Little Italy neighborhood. Staff is better than expected for a mega chain like Marriott. We arrived early in the day and called to see if we could check in early. The phone guy was unhelpful, but we checked again at the front desk just to be sure and got a room immediately from the very helpful and friendly clerk Grace.

It's a close walk to restaurants such as Phillips Seafood and the Ruth Chris Steakhouse as well as near to a Charm City Circulator bus (free!) and the Metro line. It's easy to find and well situated in the centre of Baltimore so you can strike out in any direction to explore. The historic Fell's Point neighbourhood is about 2 miles east and worth a visit but don't walk there as you have to go through a dodgy area that is probably slated for gentrification. Back to the hotel... The rooms were nice, clean and well maintained. The bathroom has a curved shower rod and Bath & Body Works toiletries. The towels were nice and fluffy. We had a waterfront facing room (faced west towards Camden Yards) which was furnished with pillow top beds, a desk and desk chair, a chair by the window, flat screen HDTV on a dresser unit that housed a safe, and fridge. There was also a small wet bar near the door with a personal Keurig coffee/tea maker. Amenities were very nice but expensive. The on-site restaurants and cafes were great but if you have time you can easily strike out for a restaurant in the neighbourhood such as the ones mentioned above. In the immediate vicinity of the hotel are an Irish pub (the James Joyce), a movie theatre, a Starbucks and a couple blocks to the east, a Whole Foods grocery store and a Rite Aid pharmacy. Take a harbourfront walk (via the footbridges over the slips) to Phillips Seafood and the former power plant which contains the Hard Rock Cafe, Barnes and Noble, and other restaurants. Internet is free in the lobby but not in your room ($12.95/day for internet access via Ethernet AND Wi-fi) and parking is $26/day or $40/day with valet service. The parking garage is located across the street from the hotel and you take a somewhat serpentine journey through the connecting elevators and hallways into the hotel. I'd recommend staying here except that it's somewhat pricey (I stayed on a reduced conference rate) so if you see deals on Priceline or anywhere else, seize them. I'd say the cost reflects the location rather than anything else about the hotel which was nice but not really stellar. It may be worth noting that there was a mistake in my reservation (which was made more than 2 months in advance) but I did get comped with a waterfront view at no extra charge, so that somewhat made up for it and was a nice gesture.

We had two rooms on the 17th floor with a great view of the harbor. Occupancy was high so connecting rooms were not possible but they were close enough so it didn't matter. The rooms were clean and up to date but the bathrooms were very small. There were no stains on the carpet or bedding and all furniture was in very good condition. The halls were clean and free of room service carts/cleaning supplies etc. The concierge lounge on the 31st floor is absolutely beautiful with great views of the harbor. It is clean and well staffed. The only issue we found was the fact that if you are below the 24th floor you need to take an elevator down to the 5th floor and switch to another in order to get up to the 31st floor. One bank of elevators is for L-23 and the other is for 24-32. This was only a hassle once as a convention was letting out and several elevators were packed full as they arrived on the 5th floor heading up. The indoor pool was clean as was the deck surrounding it. Right outside the pool is an outdoor patio overlooking the harbor with pleny of tables chairs to sit and enjoy the weather. The Sunday Brunch at the hotel restaurant was well stocked and very good..... a good deal at $24.95. We did not eat any other meals at the hotel. Valet parking and self parking are available in the hotel's garage next door. Valet is $40 per day and self parking is $26 per day. The valet is hassle free and quick as we had virtually no wait for out car. Overall the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront is a great place for business or pleasure.

The problems were minor and I would say that it falls just a bit short of being a \"very good\" hotel but it's definitely better than average. The location is what put it over the top for me. If you're trying to decide to stay in either downtown or in the harbor area you definitely want to stay in the harbor area. Downtown Baltimore can get very shady especially West of the harbor. And I was there during the day. I couldn't imagine being there at night. The Marriott is on the east side of the harbor while most of the action is on the west side of the harbor but that's absolutely fine with me. There are a bunch of restaurants in the neighborhoods just east and north of the hotel along with a movie theater, a big pharmacy, Starbucks etc. There's also a water taxi stop right near the hotel entrance that will take you all over the harbor for 10$ a day. In my opinion, the location of this hotel is ideal. What was wrong? Little things. The safe was broken, the minibar was empty, the water cooler in the lobby was kind of dirty looking, the bathroom door stuck. The big thing was the bed which was not very good. The mattress seemed very old and soft and the mattress topper was not of good quality. I was shocked at how poor it was given the Marriott brand. It didn't keep me from sleeping but usually you feel like \"Wow\" when you lay down on a brand name hotel bed. This bed was more of a \"Huh?\" If all fairness they did offer to fix the safe (which I usually use for a laptop) and the fridge was empty because they had eliminated the mini bar program.

We had requested a waterfront room which we were given, but because it was on a low floor (8th), there was a large flat roof immediately outside of our window that did not make for the view I was looking for. We called the front desk, and were immediately given a room on the 28th floor (corner room) with a spectacular view of Baltimore inner harbor and city. The rooms were clean and well kept. Nice little bar area immediately upon entering the room with cabinet space (my 8 year old son was able to fit into it and made it his little 'cave' while playing his Nintendo DS/iPad), and refrigerator just under the cabinet that held the TV. The boys really enjoyed going into the high speed elevator (there are two elevators - one for the lower floors, and one for the high floors) and my husband and I just loved the view! The hotel is within walking distance of all the sites (aquarium, mall, inner harbor area, Little Italy, etc.)...very convenient to stop back at the hotel to drop things off and head back out. The walk ways to get to the main inner harbor shopping area were really nice and made for some great photos. My sons also loved the paddleboats and snow cones located near the aquarium. The service at the Marriott was EXCELLENT, starting with the swift manner in which Marriott was able to accomodate our request for a room change. My youngest son has milk/peanut allergies, so I had contacted the concierge in advance of our trip to make them aware of this. I immediately received a note from the manager letting us know to contact them upon our arrival and they would accomodate any request from our son so that he could enjoy an allergen free meal. Were they true to their word! After spending most of the morning /afternoon sightseeing, we went to the hotel restaurant only to find they weren't open again till dinner, so went to the bar/lounge area. The boys loved sitting on couches around a coffee table to eat a late lunch in a large lounge area...and the server (a man with a beard who catered to our every need and was extremely friendly) made sure that the french fries my son had ordered did not contain any contact with milk products or peanut oil. Later that evening, we asked the concierge for some choices in Little Italy, and were given some names of restaurants that would cater to allergies. The restaurant recommended by the concierge (Sabatino's) was great for a family meal, and food was definitely true to Little Italy. After dinner, we decided to check out the deck on the 5th floor. I highly recommend if you stay to check it out in the evening for the incredible night time views of the Inner Harbor / city. Marriott did a great job of positioning lounge chairs and stools on the deck to create some nice ambience at night. It is located on the same level as the indoor pool, and of course my sons enjoyed taking advantage of the pool as well. The gym is also well equipped. Only negative thing I can say is that the hotel is pricey, but for most part typical for a hotel in a major city and with waterfront views. Very impressed with the excellent service and especially family friendly atmosphere of this Marriott.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cKACP Conference 2010\u201d", "Author": "hicksw", "ReviewID": "UR117289100", "Content": "This is my absolute favorite hotel.

The staff was very professional and friendly at the same time. We enjoyed the banquet and catering service courtesy of my convention and everything was very tasty. The rooms were large, very clean with Keurig coffee maker and refridgerator. I titled this review as near perfection because housekeeping was not up to par one of the days of our stay. My room had not been made up by 2pm so I called down. they told me that housekeeping was on until 3pm that day and they would get to my room soon. By 4pm, the room had not been made up when I checked again (granted we did have an earthquake and brief evacuation ) and housekeeping promised they would have someone make it up. Housekeeping eventually came and did a cursory bedmaking and towel change and that was it, no vacuuming or replenishing the shampoos soap etc (I was out).

I used to think it was the Renaissance Harborplace with the recent renovation and the adjoining mall and bridge to the Pratt St and Light St pavillions. The view west towards the Aquarium and Camden Yards is terrific both day and night. It is also a shorter walk to the Aquarium than the Renaissance. Rates were also higher than the Renaissance. The Harbor East area is about five years old with a few dozen high rises and upscale restaurants. Nearby Little Italy and Fells Point is sharply contrasted with old, smaller bulidings and a multitude of dining options at more affordable prices. Harbor East definitely seems like the more adult side of the Inner Harbor compared to the more family oriented west side of the Inner Harbor. Now that our youngest kids are teenagers, it's refreshing to not dodge strollers and ankle-biters. Harbor East is safe and walkable in the evening. The Marriott Waterfront's ground floor has at least 30 ft ceilings. I was surprised to see five business conferences and meetings on a hot summer Monday. The room was typical Marriott size at about 300 sq ft. The bed was somewhat on the soft side for me, but was fine for the wife. The reading lights on the headboard was a nice touch. Also a lamp on each night stand (with electrical receptacles) and floor lamp with the easy chair and ottoman. The bathroom was on the small side with less than five feet between the counter and the tub. Laptop-sized safe and spiffy small fridge was appreciated. The programming on the flat-panel TV had plenty of cable programming and included a waterfall scene with music. Some other hotel chains have begun to include a recycling bin in the room. This is one of the few Marriotts I have seen with a recycling bag to collect such items. When the Sixth St Pavillion has concerts, the cheap (free) seats on the promenade on the west of the hotel. You can hear the music fine, just can't see the performers. Self-parking is next door connected by a bridge.

We were celebrating over 40 years of marriage. In the online reservation we mentioned the special occasion, asked for King size bed guaranteed and a few other things to make the occasion a good one. It took us over 45 minutes to check in. First off, the front desk did not have us in their system. Fortunately, I had printed off the online reservation sheet in full. The clerk, who was nice enough but slow as molasses, left the room for about 10 minutes. She came back with the report that she had found a room for us on the 17th floor, which was nice since we had paid for a harbor view and higher up gives you a better view. I took the bags up to the room and opened the door to see two double beds. I turned right around and returned to the lobby. When I reminded the clerk that we were here for an anniversary she said (for the first time) oh, we only have double bed harbor view rooms left. At this point, I was pretty upset. I told the gal I had a guaranteed King bed reservation. I know that Marriotts have to honor this. She would not budge. No apologies were made. So I asked for the manager. After about 10 minutes, the manager came out and asked if our online reservation said King Bed Guaranteed. I showed him the online print out and he said well I guess we have no choice but to upgrade you to a corner king room on the 17th floor. This was at about the 45 minute point. The upgrade was at no cost but it got our stay at the Marriott off to a very bad start. The room was nice. Spectacular views. Small bathroom. Good bed. Refrigerator. Morning paper. There was no written apology made and no bubbly for the check-in pain caused. The toilet had to be fixed. At checkout, I was second in line in the lobby. There were two lines. It took at least 10 minutes to get the checkout accomplished. If you are going to stay at this Marriott ( we have always had good service at other Marriott\u2019s we have stayed in), make sure you print out in full your reservation and have it handy. Also, be prepared to wait forever in the lobby. Do not expect any special touches. Now for the pleasant park of the trip. We had a great couple of great days sightseeing. It was in the mid-90s so we largely planned indoor activities. The Walters Art Gallery was a spectacular way to begin. It is located up near the Washington statue and tower. We spent 4 hours looking at Walter\u2019s magnificent masterpieces, including wonderful Impressionists. Also have a wonderful Asian Ceramics section. The museum is free and you can park at a reduced cost at the close by lot recommended on the website. The next day we went to the Baltimore Museum of Art and enjoyed another 4-5 hours there. Parking in their lot, which was $6 all day, was convenient and the museum is free. This museum has a wonderful sculpture garden adjacent to a very good restaurant. The sculpture garden has Rodins and other famous sculptures. The museum is broad based in its collection. It has one of the world\u2019s largest Matisse painting collections (Cone Sisters collection) and many beautiful impressionists and paintings from the Renaissance period. On the last day, we spent a couple of hours at the National Aquarium. We had enjoyed a couple of times years ago. It has become a little passe. It does not compare favorably against aquariums we have seen such as Seaworld in Orlando, Sharks Reef at Mandalan Bay Hotel in Vegas, Scripps in San Diego area, and Barcelona (really spectacular and the largest in Europe). The aquarium is still nice just not spectacular. The ray tank is large and a treat to see. The shark tanks are mediocre. The reef exhibits are well organized and informative. There is a lot of space devoted to posters of marine life that could have actually had some marine life, however. The dolphin tank is large but it is situated in a large separate building with not much else going on.

One night, I was not in the mood to leave the property and decided to take my chances at \"the hotel bar\" (yikes, right?). But damn! The caesar salad with crab cake was fantastic. Cake was almost entirely jumbo lump crab, the salad was nicely chopped and lightly dressed.

I was constantly impressed with this hotel, in so many ways. The front desk agent, Sarah, was friendly and sweet- and took the time to walk me to the elevator area when I was all set. I also saw another agent doing this. It's the little things that count, sometimes. Upon arrival, I asked if I could be placed in a waterfront room, but unfortunately there was a charge for the upgrade. I am a government employee, and had to \"pass\" on the upgrade, since it would have come out of my own pocket. Much to my pleasure- I checked in to my room and found that I had a \"water side\" view, which was incredible. I don't think this hotel has any bad views. My friend met me at the hotel, and we checked out the pool and fitness area right before it closed. I brought my camera as the city view was one to remember. Regretfully I did not catch his name, but the young man who works in that area from Thailand was very nice to us and insisted he take our picture on the balcony, even though he was needing to leave to catch the last train home. The bellstaff, valet, and greeters in the entrance of this hotel are another thing to write home about. All of the gentlemen are helpful, event when swamped with people and guests. You can't stand in the lobby with out someone asking you if you needed something or if a taxi can be called for you. They provided umbrellas when it was raining, and maps for walking (along with detailed instructions), and happily/safely store your luggage for you once you've checked out but have time before your departure. The qualifications for being hired at this Marriott must be very high. We did have one issue- the person in the room next to us was smoking both nights, and the smell would instantly seep through the adjoining doors. The first night we did not report this to the hotel staff, but the second night we alerted the night auditor at about 2am. Everyone took this very seriously (as it was a non-smoking hotel) and both security and the auditor were very concerned about our comfort and health. We were offered to be placed in a different room, but didn't want the trouble of moving and weren't extremely upset about the whole thing. Darin from security extended a free breakfast for the both of us, which Nicole kindly helped us with at the front desk in the morning. The cleaning staff leaves their name on a card, and a packet of mini-chocolate bars for you after they have finished tidying up your room. Bath products are from Bath and Body works, and are good quality. Our final morning we had breakfast downstairs, at a table right in front of the water. Samir was very attentive and inquisitive about our stay in Baltimore. He also topped our delicious buffet breakfast with a to-go brownie for each my friend and myself.

Fells Point is right up the street and is probably a 10-15 minute walk. We did not eat dinner at the hotel but did have the breakfast buffet.

Criticisms are small and as follows: The iron in the room leaked water on our clothes; no damage, just water. A strip of wood fell off of a drawer when opened. There are additional outlets near the tv for computers, cell phones, etc. When we removed the plug the entire faceplate pulled away from the cabinet. It took two hands to unplug our items.

Apart from one minor misunderstanding staff was helpful. PARKING: As of 12/10 it is $40 for valet and $26 for self-parking in a lot next to the hotel, both with in/out privileges. The hotel valet has reserved all parking spaces on the first 4 floors of the parking structure so be prepared to drive up a long way in order to self-park. NOTE: A high rise is going up about 100 feet away. We there on the weekend when there was no construction but during the week I would assume ample construction noise on that side of the hotel. WIFI: Unfortunately some hotels still charge for in-room Wifi and this hotel is one of them. I think it was $14/day or thereabouts.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Az", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel great location\u201d", "Author": "Phoenixtraveller", "ReviewID": "UR89189043", "Content": "The hotel is truly beautiful and delivers great service.

To make a long story short. I checked in late in the evening on a Monday, went to sleep, woke up and attended the conference. Throughout the day I began itching only to discover later that evening I had large red bumps on my back and shoulders. I then went to John Hopkins Hospital for medical treatment only to be told what I had was bed bug bites! I quickly returned to the hotel and alerted staff. They moved me to another room and locked off the room I was in and said they would have it inspected. It was not until late the next afternoon that they had an inspector who was the hotel's routine, regular \"hotel inspector\" come in to investigate. My first concern is the hotel did not contact the health dept to report this incident. Additionally they called in some \"routine\" guy to inspect the room. So, naturally the hotel manager, \"Nick\" (who has also been mentioned in a previous review) contacted me and said they have no evidence of bed bugs in their room. I was in perfect health with not a bite on my body between checking in and discovering the to be determined bed bugs and I had not left the hotel. Without carrying on any longer I will just say that the manager Nick and all other staff that I dealt with were very very rude and unsympathetic to the situation and in no way, shape or form accepting any bit of responsibility of the matter. In addition to being in great physical discomfort, I was mistreated by staff and also at the advice of the hospital's doctor discarded all my belongings. I did not receive any bit of an apology or compassion from any staff member of the hotel nor did I receive a penny in reimbursement for the bug infected room or any of my personal belongings that I had to discard. This is only the beginning of me spreading the word about my experience in hopes that hopefully no one will go through the same thing as me and maybe if staff of the hotel reads this it will prompt some changes.

I have stayed at roach motels that were more inviting and accommodating than this location. I've also stayed at lovely marriott hotels before that provided a wonderful stay. Upon arriving to this location we were greeted by the noisy roar of some type of water removal/water damage control machine out side of the building sitting in the middle of the driveway and entrance to the building. When I went inside to check in I soon became aware what was going on, with all the tubes pumping air through the rooms and the slight smell of moisture that had been sitting on the walls. This however did not bother me too much, I understand that stuff happens. I began the check-in process. This is when I quickly realized that the quote I had been given on the internet was no where near my true price. Fee after fee was added on to my original quote, including a 15% tax, nightly \"incidentials\", and of course parking... which was way more expensive than I could have found elsewhere but hey, convenience is expensive. But having no other choice I took the new price and continued my reservation. Soon I found out that #1 internet was not free, #2 there was no such thing as a continental breakfast, and #3 on my second day, No one came in to my room to provide me new towels or make the beds. I never put up a do not disturb sign. No one offered to help us with our bags as we made our way into the hotel even though we had a few. The staff were distant and unconcerned that we even existed. Unless of course they were trying to get money from us. The whole stay was absolutely uncomfortable. I felt like the hotel was simply trying to squeeze every last penny out of me (maybe to pay for their water damages) and send me on my way while providing the least service and hospitality possible. Then upon checking out I was informed that I would be charged for internet. This I fought because of the fact that we were told that we could have one day of free internet if we came all the way downstairs and sat in the lobby. So at midnight on the first day after a long day of excitement in lovely baltimore we had to leave the comfort and privacy of our rooms to go downstairs into the public lobby in order to get access to the internet. We did this on the first night only. The second night we were too exhausted from a day on the town to even bother staying awake. I was very upset to find out that they were attempting to charge us this fee after we inconvenienced ourselves on our vacation in order to NOT get charged for something that even the crappiest, cheapest 1-2 star hotels provide for FREE. Upon asking the receptionist why the hotel did not provide us any of these conveniences such as breakfast, morning coffee, or free internet. Her response was, \"Ma'am, This is a 5 star hotel.\" In a very condescending and greater-than-thou tone. This was outrageous. Apparently with this statement she implied that the more stars a hotel has the less service and hospitality it has to provide. The more stars a hotel has the less the employees have to be concerned about the experience and comfort of the guests. AND the hum-dinger of all, that because this was a 5 star hotel, people like me were the only ones who had a problem with paying for all the modern conveniences that cheaper hotels provide for free at a marginally lower price. Apparently, I don't possess enough money to have a good experience at your hotel. Apparently, your hotel is too \"rich\" for me. And apparently, your hotel doesn't mind imposing a criminal 15% tax and other miscellaneous charges on some innocent vacationers and STILL making them feel like worthless scum while they stay. Apparently 5 star really means 1 star, and believe me I would much rather stay at a days inn next time i visit baltimore (which I do once a year) Or even the Tremont plaza which has always provided excellent service and amenities. The only good thing about my stay at this hotel was my view from the 24th floor of the entire city of baltimore, which was breathtaking. But I could get that at the Tremont too.

The hotel was VERY busy with a conference, but I was able to check in fairly early. I was upgraded to a Corner King room overlooking the Inner Harbor. Very nice room, clean, lots of big windows and an excellent view. My only issue, and it is a big one, was that there was a rock concert (Counting Crows) at the amphitheater adjacent to the hotel and the noise went on until 11 PM. I later found out that they hotel, as a rule, hands out letters to arriving guests on/around days that concerts take place, but nothing was given to me, nor did some staffers know this was going on. I suggested that they get some updated info from the venue as fully half of the rooms would be affected by the noise. The property itself is lovely. Very friendly staff, and they pay attention to details. A large piece of tarp from a nearby construction site blew into the entry driveway and a bellman promptly removed it. I did not drive so I can't comment on the parking. However, the hotel is very well located for seeing the area, including the harbor, Little Italy, Fells Point etc. There is a water taxi stop just outside the hotel.

It was open all day with a wide array of beverages (including 2 flavors of fresh brewed iced tea), omeletes and pancakes cooked to order, along with the usual array of Concierge breakfast offerings. Around lunchtime, they had crab/corn chowder as well. The evening offerings included a few kinds of hot appetizers as well as cheese displays, crudite and more. Dessert was the only thing lacking.

The other set of elevators were for Lobby, 2, 3, 4, 5 and rooms 24 to 32. We ended up on the 29th floor with amazing views of the inner harbor. The room was beautifully furnished (usual Marriott style) with nice desk, HD TV, reading lights (in addition to desk lamps by the bedside). There was a little nook for the coffee maker and ice bucket. Coffee maker and ice bucket doesn't have to take up space on the desk. I thought that was a great touch. There was a safe in the room (inside top desk drawer) - we did not use it. Indoor pool, dry sauna and fitness center on 5th floor. No hot tub. Walls are okay - could not hear noise from hallway or next door. The service staff are friendly and polite and efficient. After we got in our room, we noticed that the refrigerator was not working. We did not call the front desk right away (not really an emergency). My husband and daughter went out to check the pool, restaurant, etc. After they got back in the room, my husband said he stopped by the front desk and told them about the refrigerator and he was told that they will send somebody right away. And they did. About 10-15 minutes later, somebody came in to check our refrigerator, and deemed it not working. He said he will be back with a replacement. And he did, about 15 minutes later. And no, they did not charge us for using the refrigerator.

I'm sure that she is frustrated with the system, but I didn't appreciate that she took it out on us. I was a Marriott Gold Elite and now a Silver Elite and that was by far, the rudest front desk person I've encountered at a Marriott property.

I guess I\u2019ll go with negatives first: The bad: Upon first arriving we were quite a bit early for check in as our flight got in around 9:30am. We went to the hotel hoping a room might be ready. However, only rooms with 2 beds instead of 1 king were available. Understandable, we thought this might happen. We were told we could check out bags in the mean time at the bell desk. We waited at the bell desk for approximately 15-20 minutes before anyone helped us. At first I was trying to be conciliatory because it was a very busy morning in the hotel as many wedding guests appeared to be arriving along with the couple getting married. I noticed a women in a hotel uniform in her upper forties early fifties about 10 yards away in the center of the lobby ignoring us as we waited and waited. Again I thought perhaps she was the wedding planner and waiting for the bride or something along those lines and that is why she wasn\u2019t helping us. Every time I looked around and met her glance she turned away, which I thought was odd. Then she started speaking to some of the guests who were waiting to check in, and waiting for the elevators and cabs. A few minutes later she went to the concierge desk and started aimlessly shuffling papers around. As she walked past I tried to get her attention to ask how long the bell deskman would be and she ignored me. At around the 15 minute mark my fianc\u00e9 became very annoyed and started to walk towards the front desk to ask if we could just leave the bags behind the desk as they were only 2 small overnights and a lap top case when he was intercepted by the same woman who was ignoring us. She checked our bags for us after all. I hate to think it but we both got the impression that she was ignoring us because of the way we were dressed and our ages based upon the way that she was looking at us, and her interaction with us when she finally took the bags. We are both in our mid-20s and were wearing jeans (granted with a nice top and blazer for him as well) while the rest of the guests she was chit chatting with were in the 50s and wearing pant suits and suits. The rooms were about average. Considering what the normal nightly rates are at this hotel I expected the rooms to be much larger. As a hotel that is branding itself as a 5 star location, I must say the off-strip Hilton in Vegas was MUCH nicer than this hotel, both in size of rooms, size of bathrooms and the bedding (I\u2019m a sucker for a great hotel bed) and the amenities. If we had standard sized suitcases we would have been hard pressed to find room to get ready and move about comfortably. I was also surprised how thin the walls seemed to be. I was able to hear everyone up and down the hall almost as if my door was open. I was also able to actually distinguish what the people in the next room did and did not crave for breakfast the first morning. I was also surprised to find that the refrigerator in the room was locked! Something that I have never seen before in a hotel with a note saying refrigerators were available to rent upon request. Very odd and annoying seeing as we were on vacation to celebrate our anniversary and wanted to chill some champagne. On the second night we were there we called down to get two champagne glasses for said bubbly and waited almost an hour to no avail. A second call finally brought someone up about 5 minutes later. The morning we left we must have somehow shut off our alarm in our sleep because when I woke we had about 10 minutes to leave and catch our flight. I realized at the airport that my fianc\u00e9 thought I left a tip for the housekeeping staff and I thought he left a tip and felt absolutely terrible! Seeing as we were so rushed, our room was even more of a disaster than it might have normally been. I called the hotel the next day when we arrived back home to ask if they might be able to put a tip on the credit card I used that they had yet to charge and they said they could. However, I didn\u2019t see it as a charge when they finally processed incidentals. The good: The views are great from the rooms and the location is fantastic for doing all sorts of great inner harbor things. Cabs readily available on premises at almost all times and the one time there wasn\u2019t a cab and we had reservations to dinner, the valet immediately got on his cell phone and had one rushed over. A young woman at the front desk in her 20s with dark hair named, I believe Kayla, or something along those lines. She was the one there when we first arrived and offered to call me when a room was available. She left a message that we found on the voicemail of the room when we returned asking if everything was to our liking in the room and we received our bags from the bell desk ok. She is also the girl we reached when I called down to the front desk a second time about the glassware. She was incredibly apologetic and quick to remedy the situation. We purchased internet access for 2 days which was supposed to start at noon and go to the following noon, however because only used it once during the second portion of time, they only charged us for one day of usage which was nice of them. I would stay here again mainly for the location, but only if I was able to get a great deal on Priceline again.

Last year we stayed at the Marriott Camden Yards. We decided to give the Waterfront a try. This hotel was comparable to the Camden Yards Marriott, but it has a much better location if you are going to be around the Inner Harbor a lot. An easy walk across a bridge and you are pretty much at the Inner Harbor. You can also take a water taxi which can be picked up practically outside the front door. I wouldn't advise this however unless you have somebody in your party that has difficulty walking longer distances. The fare would run $22 one way for 2 adults and one child. As Silver Elite members, we were able to get upgraded to a 25th floor room with a view of the Inner Harbor (2509). The room was on par with other Marriott properties, but the bathroom was on the small side. This is because it is a remodeled hotel. Other than that, you could not tell it has been remodeled. The rooms have a new flat screen TV and contemporary furniture and fixtures. Beds are comfortable, as always with the pillow top. The service has been consistent, no matter which Marriott we stay at and this was no different. Check-in was quick, but when we got to the room, the safe was locked by the previous occupant. A call down to the front desk and 5 minutes later and somebody was at our door to fix the problem. Our room rate was to include breakfast. When we received our bill, the room service folks had added the breakfasts to our bill. This was immediately removed by the front desk upon checkout with no questions asked. Room service by the way, was on time (actually a little early one day) and curteous. Parking was easy in the adjacent parking lot, but it was expensive at $25 a day. Valet I believe was $38 a day. Unlike other resort properties, their parking lot was run by a separate company, so I understand the parking fee. On a resort property with timeshare ownership, I just don't understand Marriott's need to charge guests for parking, but that's a whole separate issue. We didn't eat at the restaurant, but the room service food was good and plentiful for the price. My wife had pancakes that were as big as a 10\" dinner plate and there were 3 of them. The food arrived hot on both days. The bar area in the lobby was a nice place to grab a drink. They have some nice beers on tap. All in all, I would stay here again if we return to Baltimore.

The hotel parking garage is the only one close to the hotel (the next closest parking lot is about three blcoks away). You have two choices. Self Parking at $21 or Valet at $36. I choose \"Self Parking\" for $21 (it's a major city, $21 a day is not bad). But surprise, surprise, as you drive up level after level in the garage, you see plenty of empty spaces but on the walls are \"Valet Parking only\" signs. You see this on the third floor, on the forth floor, the fifth floor, and only after you pass those signs can you self park and guess what, all of the spots on the sixth floor are full, the seventh floor are full, the eighth, the ninth and even the roof deck so it leaves you with no choice but to bring your car back to the front door and let them valet park your car for an additional $15 a night. If the cost of parking is not an issue to you, stay here, it's a very nice hotel. If this will bother you, don't, there are plenty of other hotels in this area. One more word of caution.

For starters, we paid for parking, which pretty much guaranteed us a place to park - or so we thought. When we returned to the hotel on Saturday evening, there was absolutely nowhere to park in the garage. All of the spaces were taken for some sort of gala, and even the valet parkers couldn't park any more cars. It would have been nice to receive an advisory when checking in and paying for parking of such gala and the potential for the lack of parking. The valet drivers were scary, to put it mildly. When they were moving vehicles, they were acting as if the garage was the Indianapolis 500. Needless to say, I wouldn't let one of them drive my car, which is what the front desk supervisor offered when we complained about the lack of parking. Obviously we turned it down. The parking garage is a bit cumbersome to get to. To get to the parking garage you have to go down to the main lobby, around the corner, UP an elevator to the third floor and then across a skybridge.

While I was there, Billy Idol performed at Pier Six and the concert could be easily heard and seen by sitting just outside the Marriott (free, without the hassle of parking). I suppose that this could also fall into the \"con\" arena if there was a particularly loud performance and your room happened to be on a lower floor facing the harbor and pier six.

An annual conference I attend is held in another hotel that does not get good reviews from attendees, so I always stay somewhere else. This was my first visit to this Marriott and I have to say I had one of the best rooms in the chain, anfd I've stayed in many Marriotts. It was a ninth floor corner room, with two walls of windows offering incredible views of the Inner Harbor and city. Walking into the room there is a foyer with a table on which the coffeemaker sat (Paul Newman single-serving \"pods\"). There was a rather narrow closet, but it was fine since I was by myself. The bathroom was standard Marriott and clean. The bedroom was huge with a king bed, day bed, workstation, dresser and a 37-inch flat screen TV -- and the sleep timer on this one actually works! The bed was ultra comfortable, loaded with pillows and immaculately clean. The fitness center is well-equipped, with towels and water at each piece of cardio equipment. There is a small indoor pool and you can go outside to the nice sundeck. The fitness center is accessible 24-hours a day. The pool closes at 11 p.m. A couple of issues keep me from giving a fifth star. While the staff were warm and friendly and check-in and check-out were a breeze, I had to call twice, both times with ten rings, before someone finally answered the phone so I could request a wake-up call. When I returned late each evening, every light in the room was on, which I thought was a waste of energy. Since there was no turn down service, I guess the lights are left on from the time the room is cleaned. Yet, the hotel touts its green credentials. I like a cool room at night, but I don't think the thermostat worked properly because even turned to the high-70s, the blower was shooting out very cold air. I object again to the $9.95 a day Marriott charges for in-room Internet access, which they sweetened in recent years by throwing in \"no extra charge\" local and long distance phone calls, which I don't need since I have my cell phone. This hotel is in a great location, which others have already mentioned. Still, at night, about a block from the hotel, I was approached by someone asking for money. Sad to say, Baltimore has its issues. I recommend an Orioles game at Camden Yards. What a great field! You really feel close to the action. There are plenty of tickets, since it's a .500 team. There is also a \"no scalping\" area where you can try to bargain with guys who are trying to sell you tickets. Police are nearby watching everything and it's legit, I'm told you can sometimes get really good bargains, especially if the game has already started, All in all, if I'm back at the conference in Baltimore again next year, I will definitely stay here.

Finally at 6:30 I cancelled my order and walked over to Starbucks, which is right around the corner. When I cancelled they never apologized...just said...Okay, it's cancelled. The worst part for me were the door slammers. Starting at about 3am, doors start to slam. I looked out one morning to see what it was and an employee was shoving bills under the doors. I guess they take the stairs and then let the doors slam. Then at 5am, they slam again....I looked out and they were delivering the newspapers outside everyone's rooms. Then between 5 and 7, doors slam continually. There is a lot of construction going on and you can hear drilling and workers. I had classes to be at by 8am, so it only bothered me a little, but on several occasions I heard complaints from other guests about not being able to sleep in due to the noise. I was on the 21st floor, so the high floor did not help. I think that the doors must be set to close automatically and if one does not take care to hold the door while closing, it slams with such force that the entire floor shakes. Impossible to sleep. I would probably not stay here again. There are a lot of choices in the area. In fact, I would have probably stayed at Henderson's Wharf had I know how easy of a walk it would have been for me.

If you get bored with eating in the thousands of restaurants in Baltimore (!) there is also Whole Foods just 5 minutes walk away-this is an organic type store where you can buy stuff and eat it there if you want to...this concept is unfamiliar to Europeans but a great idea. My one BIG reservation about this hotel is that the walls of the rooms are paper thin-they are just temporary style partition walls. It is easy to follow a telephone conversation held at normal levels in the next room if you want to (no I didn't want to!!) and there is a gap under the door to the room (with no draught excluder) which means that you are continually disturbed by people in the corridor outside aswell.

It also had an array of hook ups, and if you were well prepared, it would be easy enough to hook in your laptop and run a DVD on to the flatscreen. One tiny gripe: aside from the desk chair, the only seating was a chaise. What the heck am I going to do with a chaise? It was uncomfortable, and really a waste. Put in a comfortable recliner, and you get 5 stars. This property is close to many excellent restaurants, bars and sights.

The hospital recommended the hotel since they have an agreement for reduced room rate with the Marriott. Not only did we get a sizeable reduction in rate, but we also received vouchers for roundtrip taxi fare from the hotel to the hospital As a result of this we were not expecting a whole lot but, to our immense surprise, we have rarely enjoyed a hotel stay as much. From the time the valet tok our car and warmly welcomed us to Baltimore and the Marriott, until we checked out (late) the next day, we could not come up with a single complaint. After the bellman ushered us to our room he spent twenty minutes giving us a visual tour of the highlights of the city from our very large picture window. When he learned that our visit to Hopkins brought us to Baltimore he entertained us with stories of the times he had been put back toegether by the medical staff, there, and wished us good luck for our visit the next day. The room was very large, with a nice ceramic tile entrance foyer, large bathroom, and beautifully decorated with all the latest in plumped up beds, European duvets, and oodles of pillows, as well as a 42\" flat screen TV. We requested a refrigerator to chill some medication and one was promptly delivered and set up in the foyer. Arriving late, we decided to eat dinner in the Grill off of the Lobby and had a top-notch steak dinner with Ceasar salads. When the waiter had a question about the rareness of my steak order, he hand delivered the Chef to the table to make certain that the meat was cooked to my satisfaction. The special effort paid off because the meal was perfect in every respect. After dinner, we checked in with the Concierge to alert them that we were expecting a delivery of some medication and they promised that, if the delivery was late, they would take care of refrigerating it until morning, rather than bother us. The attention to detail by every single hotel employee was stunning. The room service attendant who delivered our breakfast was delightful and efficient and the hotel pastries were divine. All in all, from the quality of the luxuriously fluffy towels to the elegant bed linens this hotel lived up to anyone's five star rating. In addition, it couldn't be in a better location overlooing the harbor, the shops and restaurants, sport stadiums, and the twinkling lights of the city. And, oh yes, there's a Starbucks right across the street! The only negative that I could possibly find is the $36. charge for valet parking.

All in all, I was impressed with the size of the rooms, and how clean the room appeared. At check in, we requested a small fridge, and within 5 minutes one arrived at our door, free of charge. This hotel is great for Inner Harbor attractions. You can either walk to the Science Center, shops, eateries, restaurants, and Aquarium, or you can take the water taxi, located right outside the front area of the hotel. It cost our family $28 for an all day taxi pass. We liked that the hotel was close to the attractions, but not so close that we felt overwhelmed with crowds. There is a indoor pool with a lifeguard on duty, which is rare. The pool is not very big, but adequate for a small distraction with the kids. There are two restaurants on site, but with all the selection in the area, we choose to eat elsewhere. For eating in this area, there are many choices. There is a Cheesecake Factory, and Ruth Chris Steak House, as well as many other well-known restaurants in walking distance. Skip the restaurant next door, McCormick & Schmick's, as it is overpriced, bad food, and even worse service (e-mail me if you need details). If you want good seafood go to the Rusty Scupper or Legal Seafood. There is also an ESPN zone, and Hard Rock within walking distance. We did get room service for breakfast the next day - it was very good, large portions, and very fast. They have a concierge level, which includes access to the concierge lounge. Free snacks, bottled water, sodas and continental breakfast, are included in your room rate. We requested this level, but they were booked. They did, however, give us access to this area for an additional $20, which I thought was a good deal. The lounge overlooks the fireworks as well. They are building something right in front of the hotel, and the noise might wake late sleepers up. We woke up around 9 a.m. and didn't hear anything. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel for families, or couples wanting a get-away weekend. If you go for the 4th, make sure you can see the \"Domino Sugar\" sign from your room. That is where most of the fireworks are set off. We were on the 20th floor, and could see fireworks for miles and miles in the nearby cities. Also, since they are building right in front of the building, make sure that whatever they are building doesn't obstruct your view of the harbor from your room.

It appeared that the hotel was very full -- several wedding receptions were happening there, and lots of tourists buzzing around. The room itself was nice -- beautiful view of marinas at the waterfront, decorated well, clean, etc. It's not a luxury hotel, in my opinion, but it's an upscale hotel with some nice touches. The bathrooms feature complimentary Orange and Ginger Bath and Bodyworks products, which I adore. The only complaint I would register on the room is that the walls were very thin, and I felt that the guests next door sounded as if they were actually IN our room. The lobby is beautiful - spacious, welcoming, attractive - with lots of marble and decorative touches. We had drinks at the hotel bar on Saturday night and found the service to be very good. Prices at the hotel bar weren't cheap, but the ambience is nice. The area where the hotel is located is one of the growing parts of the downtown area, with many new restaurants, condos, and office buildings preparing to open.

If we were there longer, I would have asked for a change. Good thing I read previous reviews so I did ask for a mini fridge, and it was provided at no charge. The good-- indoor pool very nice with a lifeguard (very unusual). The pool is adjacent to a rooftop patio with great views; however, the patio was locked the second day we were there. The public spaces are nice. There was an entire family watching cartoons on the plasma tv in the lobby; probably trying to spread out a bit. Unfortunately, we were wanting a quiet drink in the lobby and didn't want to listen to cartoons! James Joyce Pub, Flemmings and Roys is right around the corner. Little Italy is quite close and easily walkable, as is Power Plant Live and the Aquarium. However, the Science Center was a good 15 minute hike. Not bad for us, but little kids might get tired. I would have to say it is pretty close to the Inner Harbor. The bad- the rooms are just too small for a family. Also, when I asked for a 'view', I was told I could have one for $20 more a night. I declined, and was glad. The room we got was the same size as a 'harbor view'. And, we could still see the water and Little Italy. Also, we didn't want to be in the room long enough to enjoy the view anyway. The bellhops make a killing at this hotel, and the valet parking is $32 - self park for $21!

We had to take 3 different elevators before we reached our room. I was prepared for the $20 parking fee, so no surprise there. Plenty of parking on Level 6. Having the bottom levels for valet does not bother me. One is going to have to take the elevator anyway. The lobby area was a happening and noisy place this Saturday with lots of people.
