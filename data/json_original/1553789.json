The only mistake we made was taking the E train to the World Trade Center. Because of construction, it meant we had to walk around a lot, which was tough since I had hurt my leg.

My teenage daughter and I usually stay near Times Square but wanted to branch out. We were very pleased with this choice. I booked on Priceline then called the hotel the day before to request twin beds rather than the queen bed. They accommodated this request and also allowed us to check in at 1 PM instead of 3 PM. The room was fairly small but not cramped, and we found it very comfortable. We did hear the construction noise - my daughter slept right through it but if you're a light sleeper, some earplugs would be a good idea. The 20th floor restaurant offered a convenient and relaxing option for lunch on our first day, before heading out for our adventures. We enjoyed a marvelous soup, sandwich and crab cakes. An interesting perk is the option to borrow an ipad - they put a steep deposit on the credit card but we enjoyed having it available all weekend, to read reviews of the shows we saw and check maps and restaurant information. One other tip - for groceries or takeout meals, the Amish Market at 53 Park Place was quite amazing - it takes up an entire block and is about a 10 min. walk from this hotel.

Side note: from what we've seen the 9/11 memorial will be beautiful! However, upon our arrival one of us had gone in to check in while the other waited to see where we should park. After finding out that the parking garage was located across a busy intersection, we took the bags inside and to our surprise there was no door person/bell \u201chop or luggage rack. The woman at the front desk had to call someone to assist us and they brought a moving hand cart? Also, the beds were very uncomfortable, there was only 2 flimsy pillows in our room (we asked for more the 2nd night of our stay), they did have a coffee maker but there was only decaf available. The room was set up very odd; the bed placement and storage options were just undesirable. There was a fridge (empty for storage I\u2019m assuming) but it wasn\u2019t plugged in and because it was placed in a wall cubby we couldn\u2019t see the plug? So whatever food we stored from dinner went bad anyway. The shower was awful, low pressure and not designed for comfort. AND don\u2019t leave a few minutes past check-out time, or you will get a $35 charge added to your account. During my check out alone this not only happened to me but another couple.

The service at the restaurant was horrible and I'm really not a picky person. But I had to ask for both of my coffee refills and our waiter never checked on us again at dinner after we got our meal. I think it's because they added their tip to the check before it's given to people so why bother to have to do a good job. It's a great location and view so if they fired the manager and hired someone to manage it, it could likely do great.

The good: Great location, free internet, chilled water station on each floor. The rooms are clean and new.

My child sized bed was hard as stone, and combined with the micro size room and total lack of comfort or amenites, I felt like I was immured in a monk's cell. I am an average weight person and 5'4\" tall, but I was cramped in this bed. I can't even begin to imagine someone 6' tall trying to sleep in that bed. For a supposed four star hotel, the amenities in the bath were also spartan; mouthwash, shampoo, lotion. That's it. Not even kleenex. There were tissues in the room, and if you need one while you're in the bathroom, you have to step out there to get one. The bar and restaurant close very early and there's no minibar in the room but there was an empty refrigerator, a microwave and a coffee maker. There was a empty padded hangar in the closet that was probably meant for a bathrobe...which was not provided in my case though it would have been a welcome and not unexpected amenity in an upscale hotel. The halls are set up like a maze and gave the impression that the hotel rooms were built pre-fab somewhere else, brought fully assembled to the site, and stacked up like legos on each floor.

The room was clean and a good size, though the hallways were a bit maze-like and the elevator was painfully slow at times. Overall, the hotel's skeleton is a 5/5. Unfortunately, the staff ruined my experience of the hotel, thus dropping it to a 2/5. My partner and I stayed at this location in October 2011, and were headed to Boston on the Amtrak the following day to watch an NFL game. We had plans to come back to NYC the day after and then stay with family in a NY suburb, thus no longer needing a hotel. I had phoned the hotel prior to our trip to ask if luggage storage was available, explaining the situation (We were unable to take our larger luggage on the train, as no checked baggage was allowed). The person I spoke to on the phone noted that it wouldn't be a problem. Pleased, I didn't make a Plan B. I should have. After we returned to World Center Hotel after spending the evening sight-seeing, I decided to double check on the luggage storage prior to heading to sleep, and the individual I spoke to explained to me in a rather blunt, rather impatient tone that I could NOT store my luggage unless I had a future reservation. This was the hotel's policy and he followed hotel policy. When I asked if he knew other locations where I could store my luggage, or if storage was available at Amtrak, he said \"no\" in a dismissive fashion. Since I could tell he wouldn't be of any use, I left to go flush out a plan B, at nearly 2AM (when we had to be up at 6AM to get to the train). Luckily for me, a very kind man at Amtrak's phone line informed me that it does have luggage storage for its passengers, for a mere $4.50/bag. It wasn't the hotel policy that bothered me, or even the fact that the person I spoke to on the phone and this other hotel personnel had different stories. It was the complete lack of caring or assistance from the person running the front desk. The following morning, the same individual was working. I asked if he could get my partner and I a taxi. Again, I received a dismissive 'no'. He briefly elaborated that it would be quicker for me to catch a cab around the corner, which no doubt it was. However, his manner of informing me of this was completely inappropriate. Had he said \"I could, but actually there are usually a number of cabs just on the opposite side of the building. Please come back and I'll phone a company for you if there aren't any\", then I would have forgiven his earlier behavior, and maybe the hotel would have reached 4/5 potential. We were the only persons in the lobby during each occasion, so I can't excuse his behavior by saying \"oh, it was just busy\".

It is pretty basic. Our room was a studio kitchenette-type room, so the room was really small, and the bed was actually a converted sofa-bed. I thought it'd be dreadful, but I got really great sleep there- I didn't want to get out of bed! The pillows were also very comfortable. I liked the iPod station thing too.

You could easily miss this letter, so watch out for it in the room!!! The lady that served us at the bar was very nice. The view from the bar is interesting, and definitely worth a look.

(I highly recommend buying the 7-day unlimited MetroCard if you plan on using the subway most of the time). It is directly across from the WTC site and close to the Financial District. Also, if you're flying in/out from the NJ/Newark Airport, then this hotel is perfect because it's so close to the PATH system which takes you to NJ where you can then take NJ transit to the airport and ride the Airtrain to your terminal (save yourself the cab fare!). The concierge was also very friendly and knowledgeable about NYC, so don't be afraid to ask questions. They were also able to hold our bags for us even after check out so that we had more time to check out some sites and didn't have to lug them around.

We have stayed at MANY MANY hotels all across the city.. THANK GOD I FOUND WORLD CENTER HOTEL!! So I book the room in advance on their website. The Hotel is smack dab in front of Ground Zero( or as I call it GROUND HERO) I knew ahead of time that the rebuilding of that area is non stop, therefore most likely it would be noisy .. I didn't care .. Honestly Noise and NYC go hand in hand AND They are building history in the making before my eyes so I don't care about the noise. We get to the hotel and the lobby is SPOTLESS.. nice and cool on that SUPER HOT HOT DAY.. check in was a breeze!! The employees were so nice and so accommodating. They put us in a great room on the 17th floor(1705) with a view of ground zero. To my surprise It was not that noisy at all in the room! The windows and door are solid. The room had one area for the bed and nightstand and you walk towards the back of the room into a sitting area with a desk and pull out couch! There is a door you can open but there is no balcony or anything. When I opened the door then I can hear the noise! But what joyful noise it was.. People hard at work rebuilding a beautiful sacred site. The bathroom was a decent size. The room was MODERN AND CLEAN!!! I will say the one downfall is that it's a green hotel (which is great) BUT the air conditioner goes off when you leave the room and only turns back on when you come back in the room.. SO after being in the NYC heat all day we came back to a warm room. But once inside for a little it cools down:) We ate at the restaurant on the 20th floor it too had a great view.. Great service good prices. I honestly cannot find a bad thing to say about this hotel. The hotel is not in the \" middle of all the action\", that's true... but you take the train at Rector street and it takes you to any stop you want along the way in a matter of minutes!! The hotel is close to Battery Park which is where the ferry's for the Statue of Liberty are so that's great:) Another perk is in the hallways they have a chilled water machine with bottles that you can take and fill up with water!

There is filtered bottled water available on every floor which is great to take a few on the road it you day's travels. There is Wifi throughout the hotel and it is included in the price (and it was fast too!). The room had many plugs for electronic devices (which many hotels need to get with the times). The art/deco modern design and decor was pleasant. On the 20th +/- floor there is a beautiful outdoor view of the area i.e. the ground zero construction sites, the harbor, seaport etc. The staff was friendly and helpful. Guests can leave luggage on the 2nd floor in a monitored room for free...this was great for us in that we had 5 hours to roam the city with free hands after check out and before we had to leave the city. The area is a safe location. Starbucks is one block away. They have full digital cable channels=many selections. It was fairly easy to hail cabs from here, many times close to the front of the hotel. The CONS: The restaurant was a huge disappointment. I agree w/ what the other review says...we went up for Sunday breakfast buffet and stood in the doorway for a quite a while to just be acknowledged. While waiting we observed only 2 staff waiting frantically on a not-too-crowded place. when we were FINALLY seated but a not-so-friendly \"manager\" (super stressed out). We sat and WAITED some more. We are not unreasonable in that we expect to wait somewhat (normal)...but we got this \"bad vibe\" that the place was a cluster-**** and noticed that there were many customers waiting for bill etc. We ended up leaving after several more minutes w/o being acknowledged at all. Our time was precious in the city that day. What a huge disappointment though we waited to have a nice breakfast to end our stay there. For such a nice venue, and for being on the most busy day of the week SUNDAY, one would think they would have the staffing and service ready. I see that another review said they mandate a 18% tip. I would not pay that for such bad service...I am glad we left before we had to deal with that...and with a buffet which you wait on yourself? Ummm no. The other complaint: be prepared to WAIT a long time for the elevator...and it is stuffy, STUFF-Y! We did not have problems with noise from construction, but we were also placed at the opposite end of it. Foursquare peeps suggest to request to stay on opposite end of construction site. They are building 24/7 there. Overall, a good stay....at a HOTWIRE price...I would not pay full price for this place though.

So I decide to call the manager to complain. As you guess it, NO answer. I decided to leave a brief message with my name and cell number. The interesting part is I still have not receive a phone call. So at this point I decided to take matters into my own hands, I went to the front desk and requested to change rooms, which they were more than happy to do.

First off - this hotel is generally called \"Club Quarters World Trade Center\" on travel sites, but it appears that unless you are a Club Quarters member, you actually stay at the \"World Center Hotel\" which is all in the same building, but have different sets of front doors. This hotel was hands down a great value in NYC. We got this room for about $150 a night plus tax. The location is a little sleepy on weekends, but is safe and easy to get to (multiple train lines - 1, R, 6, and I believe the A C or E all service this general area,). The room was small, but was well appointed. Sadly, we were on the 16th floor, but the room only provided a window into a neighboring building - but the views from this hotel could be gorgeous depending on which room you get. Service was okay upon check in. We arrived well before check-in began, and it is their policy to take your bags and then have them in your room for you when you do come to check in later. Check in is done through computers in the lobby, which seems to work well (Beware, when you check in the card you use in the machine will be debited $90.00 for incidentals - I had planned to use a different card for that, but the machine does not tell you before it charges the incidentals). When checking out, we left our bags with the front desk to pick up later. When we returned to pick up our bags before departing the city, it took approximately 20 minutes to get them (it appears they store them on an upper floor) - so beware that it may not be lightning fast! The free water bottles in the hallway is really nice touch and very helpful (and saves money buying bottles from street vendors or shops!). The bed was comfortable and we slept well. The biggest downside for me to this hotel is the SHOWER. Our shower (and we had a handicap accessible shower, so perhaps it is different from others in the hotel) consisted of a 1 inch tall gray plastic wall around the floor and a shower curtain. While it looks innovative, etc. it is very easy to get water everywhere on the floor. They really should have built these showers differently.

We came across MANY problems. 2 twin beds pushed next to eachother is apparently a King sized Bed (with the crease down the middle, great for newly weds). Beds are HARD AS CEMENT, maybe some people like that. No hair dryer No iron/ironing board No mini fridge No morning newspaper No continential breakfast (as they advertised) Ikea furnishing (and the quality that comes along with it) Broken coffee pot (arent you a NEW hotel?!?) The AC was stuck at 60 degrees, the room had no extra blankets. We called for some and they never arrived. No concierge, no one to call a cab for us-because no cabs will go down the one-way alley to pick you up or drop you off Spotty internet connection that the front desk denied because they hadnt recieved any other complaints. When we went to check in, the lady acted like she was checking us in at the front desk, only to then walk us over to the self check-in. What was she doing for 3 minutes?? This happened again when checking out. It also took the guy 15 minutes to find our bags. They couldnt find a band-aid when I stubbed my toe on the construction they were doing. No apologies, apparently it was my fault for stepping on something to exit the elevator Oh yeah, and I mysteriously got a huge bug bite on my hand.... could have been the tiny bugs all over the lobby. For Pros, It was quiet, except when we opened the window to warm the room up a bit. Bottled water machines in the hallways Some people may prefer hard beds with tiny pillows", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livonia, MI", "Title": "\u201cNice new hotel, great service\u201d", "Author": "amunzenberger", "ReviewID": "UR65980750", "Content": "We really liked our stay at the World Center hotel and would definitely stay again. The hotel has a boutique feel to it and every staff member with whom we interacted was friendly and helpful. Although the room was small, it was very functional and modern with its design. There was a nice flat screen TV mounted to the wall over the desk. The bed was Very comfortable. The room was very clean (and I am extremely picky about that). One thing we thought was very cool was that the \"communal\" self-service closet on each floor from which you could get an iron, extra blankets, pillows, etc. rather than stocking every room with these things. We thought this was a very forward-thinking idea! Another nice amenity was the purified water with empty water bottles on the floor... you could get a bottle and fill up anytime you wanted for free. The hotel is still under construction and every once in a while the work above us would cause the ceiling in our bathroom to rattle, but if we closed the bathroom door it wouldn't bother us. We got a great rate thru Hotwire, so that made up for the minor annoyance. The bathroom had a shower stall (no tub if you prefer baths) and the shower head had a bit of a weak flow, but it wasn't too bad... just took a little bit longer to get the shampoo out. The hotel is still offering a free breakfast due to the ongoing construction, but we always slept in too late and never actually made it up there. Check-in and check-out was a breeze... this can also be self-service... they have three computers setup for this in the lobby. The front desk staff was so helpful and friendly, though that I never got all the way through the process... they just stepped in and did it all for me. We thought the location was great for spending time in Lower Manhattan. The hotel is a short walk from Battery Park and right around the corner from Wall Street. We also walked to TriBeCa, SoHo, Greenwich/West Village, Chinatown, Little Italy, and the Brooklyn Bridge from the hotel. If the weather is nice, you want some exercise, and you are spending most of your time in this area you may as well walk because we never found one cab driver that knew where the hotel is located. It doesn't help that the entire area is under construction so it can be very difficult for the cabbies to actually get around the streets near the hotel. It really wasn't a problem for us, though... the few times we took cabs, we just had them drop us off a couple of blocks away and walked the rest. You can always catch a cab very easily from West Rd, which is only a block away from the hotel.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cClean, quiet hotel\u201d", "Author": "NYCJUNKIE2", "ReviewID": "UR63962162", "Content": "Great clean, new hotel.

I didn't hear any construction noise, even though my room faced the construction. I was the envy of all my fellow conference attenders last week when they told me they paid $250+ to stay in dumpy old hotels by NYU. As long as they keep selling rooms for less than $200 a night, the World Center Hotel will still be a steal.
