What a great find!! The boutique feeling of the Hotel is very much like the Tower Bridge Hilton, with similar furnishings and overall design and with the added benefit of the attitude of the staff, you would not think that these are part of a worldwide chain. Turning to the Canary Wharf Hilton, the location is pretty good with access via a footbridge to Canary Wharf Underground Station, rather than opting to walk down the road to the Docklands Light Railway, as the interchange between the DLR and the Tube at Canary Wharf Station actually means you walk further!! The rooms are spacious and the furniture and fittings are all still in good shape; we were fortunate enough to be upgraded due to our Hilton Honours Status and the Executive Rooms here are larger than at Tower Bridge. The Photos here on Trip Advisor do the place justice and give a very good representation of what you get here. The real gem of this Hotel was a very large Executive Lounge with excellent staff and services and a fantastic view of London. I particularly liked the silhouette of the London Skyline etched on the Executive Lounge windows. One tip is that just down the road and across from South Quay Station is a Tescos Supermarket that is open every day (including Sundays) from 7am to 11pm.

Although the stay was for a single night, i got a decent deal while booking(which included breakfast). My partner and I arrived early into London from Paris and reached the hotel before 1 PM. The staff were quite helpful and instantly provided the room thereby saving us the trouble of leaving the luggage and traveling into the city. The early check in was a good start and we made our selves comfortable in the large spacious room. The bed was comfy but at the edge of the bed,one could hear the mattress spring moving around which was a little disconcerting. The views werent that great as there were tall buildings all around, I guess there must be other rooms overlooking the river, so opt for those. The bathrooms were very funcitonal and there was a big tub which was a boon to us as we were dead tired on arrival. The AC was comfortable and although the outside temperature was close to -2 degrees, the room was a cosy 22. My girlfriend wanted to use the internet to get some work done but we were told that it would be 15 pounds for a day's use!! Considering that most hotels these days offer free wireless or atleast a couple of hours of complimentary usage, this was a shock. It was way overpriced and something you dont expect from a hotel in the business district of London. We had a decent morning breakfast, with good options and a spread that is expected from a star hotel like Hilton.The food was fresh and filling. The location is amazing with a 5 min walk from the Canary wharf station on the Jubilee line and is quite safe even at night. There are many options to eat and shop nearby if one wants to explore.

Overall the hotel was good but I was unhappy that the prices seemed to have been jacked up for the event I came to attend. Frankly I had paid less in a Four Seasons and even at the Ritz in Tokyo. Hopefully others will have better luck. Had it not been for the price my ratings could be higher but I'll try to put this aside. Location - D: My plan was to take the Metro (Piccadily Line or Heathrow Express to Paddington) but after the long flight I grabbed a couple of friends and taxi'd in. The ride was nearly 90 pounds or about $150 and an hour drive. The drive takes you through some of the better attractions (depending on the route your driver takes) but you could to see Westminster Abby, The Defense buildings, Piccadily Circus, Buckingham Palace, The London Eye or other sights along the way. Having seen these before I just wanted to get the hotel so it was a long ride. Where you end up is in the old docks area, you know, where Jack the Ripper used to hang out. Don't mis-understand me, they've done a lot to upgrade the area and work continues ahead of the Olympics, but needless to say, you're not close to the attractions of London - although there is a tube station right nearby. Check In/Staff - B: Front desk was friendly, concierge was helpful, as were the bellmen. If you do go, and you like a good steak I highly recommend the steakhouse around the corner - the bellman will tell you the name. Unfortunately I can't recall it now. Great food, good service, great bar. Restaurant/Bar: A-: Great breakfast, good atmosphere, great environment. Really well done. In the evening the folks at the bar were really great, but a bit understaffed at times. Again, the food I had here was really good. I had the scallops and the goat cheese and pear salad - YUM! Again, the environment was very accommodating. Rooms B-/C+: This is a tough one. I have a pretty limited but specific set of needs when I stay in a hotel. I don't ask for much, a good bed, a desk with internet, and a shower with adequate space and water pressure. The bed was a bit firm but decent, the shower was small but acceptable but the water pressure was sub-optimal. Most disappointing was the fact that I had to pay 14.99 pounds (~$22/day) for internet...on top of an already exhorbinate room rate. Another mark down was that the thermostats only went to 24, which would have been fine except the cleaner kept turning it down when she cleaned. Finally, when I checked in they kindly asked me what paper I'd like in the morning. I was there 4 days and never received a paper. The paper to me was a minor detail but for the price I was paying something that I would have expected. Gym C+: Small, 2 treadmills, an eliptical, a bike, some small dumbells, and a single multi-function machine. Not a lot of room to stretch. The equipment however was in good condition, just not enough of it. Overall I wouldn't stay here again for the price I paid, maybe I would for half, and only if I had business in the area. That's not a knock on the hotel itself, it's just not in an area condusive to sight seeing.

My first impressions on the first day were of a hotel that overall had very high standards. The staff were very friendly, helpful and the hotel was extremely clean. The ambient temperature in every location was perfect, whether it be in the room, corridor, foyer or breakfast dining. The hotel room was very quiet the first night, the bed was a amazing, very comfortable. However, the second nights stay was spoiled by people in the room next to me. I was out in London all day from 11am to 10pm visiting galleries and museums and when I got back I just wanted to go to bed and sleep. Next door it sounded like they were having a bit of a party and enjoying themselves much at the expense of other hotel guests. They were going in and out of the room at what seemed like every 10 -15 minutes and letting the door slam shut, laughing loudly and playing music. I did give them the benefit of the doubt, thinking the noise would stop and they would go to bed. This did not happen and went on until I phoned the front desk at 2am and was told the hotel would speak to them. Thinking the noise would now end, I tried to get some sleep. Sadly, the noise continued and I phoned the desk again at 3.30am and was once again told they would check it out. The noise continued until I gave up and phoned the desk again at 4.10am and asked for a room change. I was then moved to an alternative room at 4.30am and eventually got to sleep around 5am. This was obviously not a very nice experience and it was compounded by the night desk manager's over sight at not dealing with the problem in the first instance when first reported at 2am. Needless to say, i was shattered afterwards for a good few days. In the morning when checking out I complained about what had happened to the Front of House Manager who was very apologetic. The outcome of this spoiled nights stay, is that I received a complimentary nights stay to be arranged when suitable to use in the future. This was the correct action and the only action by the Hotel and in fairness to the Hotel, they did show consummate professionalism when dealing with the incident the morning after. It is obviously with regret, that it was not dealt with properly the night before. So my stay was a mixed bag, the first day and night was amazing and I was highly impressed by this Hilton, but sadly it was spoiled by the extremely rude, selfish and ignorant behavior of the people in the room next door. I will be returning to stay at the Canary Wharf Hilton in April, as I do believe this was a one off incident and the Hotel have re-compensated me for the inconvenience caused. p.s. if you are staying at the Hotel I would recommend a visit to the London Docklands Museum in Canary Wharf. It took me a full 3 hours to look around it and the entrance is free.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReally Good Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "gareth_999", "ReviewID": "UR124316426", "Content": "I finished work later than planned and instead of doing the 200mile trip home decided to stay in a hotel so turned up at the hotel at 5.45am and asked what rooms they had available, instead of attempting to charge the full whack I was offered the 9am-6pm day rate of \u00a390 and they would check me now and give me a quiet floor not to be disturbed.

The hotel was very quiet, you'd hardly have known there was anyone else staying there. That could be a result of it being a weekend and the hotel being located in a business district.

BOOKING: through Hilton's official website, taking advantage of a promo, we booked an executive room for two nights with a pre-paid, non-refundable rate. Breakfast in the restaurant and executive lounge access were included. LOCATION: once rough areas, the docklands and East London are now a super-modern, beautiful business (but not only) area. CHECK-IN: quick and pleasant. Staff were always smiling and helpful. The reception is large and, just like the restaurant, with a lot of sleek limegreen glass. ROOM: we had been in a standard room previously and had an executive room this time. Not too much difference: they are medium size, ultraclean, in beautiful warm tones, all very modern and elegant. The marble bathroom is extremely nice too. The plus with an executive room consists of getting access to the executive lounge, offering free breakfast and refreshments. Since breakfast was included in our rate, we had it in the restaurant directly. The lounge is one the best I've been to, along with those at the Hilton London Tower Bridge and the Hilton Stockholm Slussen. It's big, with a beautiful view and plenty of quality food and drinks. You can make a real meal out of it. There are computers with free internet access too. SERVICES & AMENITIES: conceived as a business hotel, the Hilton London Canary Wharf has all the possible business & meeting-related facilities but since we were there for the weekend and not for business we did not try anything of that. We did try the gym and sauna. DINING: the limegreen-glass decorated Cinnamon Restaurant & Bar is chic, beautiful and coloured. We had great Hilton breakfasts there. Selection and service are very good. TRANSPORTATION & DIRECTIONS: very well connected with central London both through the underground (Jubilee Line) and the DLR (Docklands Light Railway).The DLR is next door. We used the underground instead. Exit the gorgeous Canary Wharf underground station, turn left, go through the building and the nice footbridge. The hotel is just there. It takes no more than 5 minutes. BOTTOM LINE: We were very positively impressed by this hotel and very happy with our stay. Maybe I would not strongly recommend it to people going to London for the first time because it is a bit far from the main tourist areas. Let's put it like this: after your first visit to London, this is one of the best possible places where to stay. If you prefer the West End or being in the middle of the action (this part of the city is particularly quiet on the weekends), please note that you are very well and rapidly connected to it by underground. Of course it is an even more perfect choice for those having business in the Canary Wharf / Docklands area. TIPS: Hilton is great but usually pretty on the expensive side. Since this is mainly a business hotel in a business area, rates tend to be high on weekdays; you will usually find good and sometimes really great rates for weekend stays - take advantage of that! 10-15 minutes on the Jubilee line (or DLR) will take you to Stratford, the heart of the action of the upcoming Olympics, and to the recently opened Westfield Stratford City, the largest shopping mall in Europe.

Canary Wharf is a great place to be especially at the weekend when it is handed over to the tourists. We were upgraded to a deluxe room as we had requested a high floor and we were on floor 11, one below the executive floor and it had a great view of the city. The room was large and had everything we needed. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable. It was not the largest bathroom considering the size of the room which was strange but was adequate. There were a couple of missing items such as slippers to go with the bathrobes and no camomile tea but I had taken both of these with me so no need to request them, just a bit surprised but I am sure this was not typical. The room was very clean and decorated in the Hilton style which I find just a bit drab. The breakfast was very good, the food was hot and you can have omelettes made to order and cooked whilst you wait.

I therefore filled out a best rate gurantee form as advertised on the hilton website http://www.hilton.co.uk/HiWayWeb/appmanager/portals/customer?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=pg_customer_cs_best_rates however never heard anything back even though I then emailed twice and rang the customer service line twice. Not exactly great considering i'm a hilton honors member. Also found that whilst in the hotel when I visited the health spa facilities (complimentary for hilton honors members) that there was a sign saying 'u6's may only use the swimming pool' when in fact there is no pool there is just sauna, steam room and gym. And these weren't staffed which I found a little dangerous. HOWEVER, these issues were far outweighed by the positives. I had booked the room for me and my mum as an xmas treat and we arrived at around 10.45am and did not expect to be able to check in however we were pleasantly surprised when we were informed that the room was ready and that we had been upgraded to the twin deluxe room.

A nice chair to lounge in and also a desk for business use (however the lamp didn't work, didn';t report as didn't need to use the desk). The washroom was great as it had both bath and shower and nice to see a hotel that offers conditioner as well as shampoo. The room was very quiet no disturbances had a great nights sleep.

We checked out at arund 10.30 and the process was quick and efficient, we then left our luggage with the concierge whilst I went to a job interview and collected them a couple of hours later.

Reception, lift and restaurant areas are all very well-lit, and clean. You will hear trains passing the building from fairly early until well after 10 but you get used to it and it didn't wake us up.

Ideal location when visiting the O2 as it is one stop on the tube. When my boyfriend booked the hotel, he was given the choice to upgrade to a suite if one avaliable for a reduced price, as it was for one of my bday presents he jumped at the chance. So glad he did. When we arrived, they advised we had been upgraded to the suite and this gave us use of the executive lounge. Our room wasnt ready when we arrived so they told us we could go up the lounge to wait. The executive lounge was brilliant (tea, coffee, soft drinks ie coke, red bull, fruit juice) all complimentary. Plus they had cookies laid out (warm when they first put them out, yummy), cheese straw type things and nuts. Then mid afternoon from 3 they also put a selection of sandwiches out, cakes, scones! So good and all free.You also got access to internet if you wanted it, i think this was also free but we didnt use it so not sure. Im guessing if you stay in a suite then this gives you use of the executive lounge. Views from there are so lovely as well, looking over the quay. Our suite was ready from about 3, we were on the 12th floor and had the same view of the lounge - perfect for us. Massive windows in the room to take it all in. We loved the suite, bed was huge and so comfy, 2 flat screen tv's, nice sofa area. Bathroom good size with bath and seperate shower, with lots of complimentary body moisturiser, mouth wash etc. Breakfast was included, we got the choice to have it in the main restuarant or in the executive lounge, we chose the main restaurant as they did cooked breakfast. It was buffet but lots of choice and very yummy. Check out was at 12, but we spoke to them about watching a football match in the lounge and they said this was fine they would extend our checkout until 3. Brilliant. However the channel we wanted to watch wasnt working in the lounge or our room but said we could watch in the main bar on ground floor.

The staff was efficient and friendly, from the front desk staff, the executive lounge staff, to the housekeeping staff, who visited my room in the morning while I was at breakfast, and in the evening for a turndown service, which was nice to return to after a long day of touring.

Unfortunately there was not a DVD player and after mentioning this to staff, all that was available was a portable DVD player which needed to remain plugged in! Given the size of the room and the location of the plug sockets it was not a very comfortable way of watching!

I emailed previously to ask if it was possible to have adjacent rooms with a nice view to make the stay special for my friend. We arrived at approx 1.30 and as our rooms were not quite ready, we left our bags with the concierge and went into the city. When we returned at midnight, we were delighted to have been allocated adjacent rooms both with wonderful views of the city and one was a wonderful upgraded suite. There was a slight hitch as the standard room was a double although I had specifically requested two twin rooms. However, after I made a call to the front desk, even though it was very late by this time, arrangements were made for an extra bed to be provided (which was very comfortable) along with a bottle of wine and some brownies to make amends and celebrate my friend's 40th birthday! We were delighted and it was lovely to be made to feel so special. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and we thought it was great value for money considering the deal we got through Expedia for the room and breakfast. The whole hotel including rooms and communal areas are spotlessly clean and tidy. The ensuite rooms are huge for a London with coffee/tea facilities, fluffy towels and wonderful toileties. The breakfast was great with eat as much as you like cooked breakfast, pastries, fresh fruit, yoghurt, tea/coffee, fruit juices etc which meant we didn't need any lunch that day.

We got the tube to Canary Wharf then got a bit lost trying to find the hotel (I hadn't properly checked how to get there and the tube station has a lot of exits!) We asked a policeman though and it turns out it's only about a 5 min walk. I had emailed in advance to say we'd probably arrive at around 1pm (check in is usually 3pm), and I also mentioned that it was for my Mum's birthday. We arrived at around 1.30pm and checked in no problem and we told that we had been upgraded to an executive room. We were really pleased and went up to our room on the 13th floor (in a super speedy lift!) and found a fab, large room with a great view and lovely Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries, bathrobes and slippers and complimentry water. The bathroom was huge (with a seperate shower) and all very clean and comfortable. We went out for a few hours that afternoon and got back to the hotel at around 5.30pm to find chocolate cake and balloons in the room with a card from the management saying Happy Birthday. I thought this was a lovely and very kind touch and my Mum loved it! We had dinner in the restaurant that night which was very tasty. There was then a power cut for a couple of hours so we stayed in the bar, but the staff took fantastic care of us, provided complimentary drinks and kept us updated about what was going on. A few people in the bar were getting a bit annoyed but it was not the hotels fault (turns out a lot of the area had been without power!) and we felt that they did everything they possibly could to make the situation easier! The whole thing was dealt with in a completely professional manner. The beds were seriously comfortable (I didn't want to get up!) and the breakfast was honestly the best I've ever seen in a hotel - a HUGE range of food and definately something for everyone from a cooked breakfast to fruit to breads to cold meats and cheese (to name a few!) The closeness to the o2 was fab and only took about 5 mins on the tube (to North Greenwich). It's a great hotel to stay in if you're going to an even there, but it's also really easy to get into the centre of London (about 15mins to Waterloo) I'd definately stay in the hotel again.

Love the docklands location, great to jump over to Greenwich, or explore the shops and restaurants of Canary Wharf. They were very good w communications prior to my stay, with emails from reception and restaurant asking me about my room requests and promoting their dinner service, respectively. Room wasn't ready when I checked in, they offered an alternative but as I requested a particular room number (17), end of corridor and larger than the rest, it was easy to leave luggage w the concierge and have late lunch over in Canary Wharf. They phoned when the room was ready, and luggage was already in room when I got there - Pretty good service! Breakfast service also no complaints - there was prior warning from the hotel that breakfast would be busy this weekend because of a number of groups staying - I think I queued for 10-15mins to get a table, but had my kindle so it was no hardship, and service was always faultless, considerate and smiling despite how busy it was. Ice machine in the lift lobby on every floor such a US style boon, much better than ordering up ice each time you needed it. However, this leads me onto the lip-pursing surprise of a \u00a35 charge on every room service order. Frankly it's a hateful trend. I love room-service, part of the joy of staying at a 4 or 5* property is room service. A room service charge is like being charged thrice for the privilege - once to stay at the hotel, second time for the food, third time for them to bring it to your room. They don't hide it as a service charge for tipping purposes as the chit you sign still has space to add a tip, so its cash that drops straight to the bottom line for the hotel. Bathroom on the smallish size (especially when compared to the big deluxe room) but serviceable, water pressure seems a little eco-minded, slow running and quite aerated - a bit of a disappointment.

Room was very nice, clean and spacious with all you could need in it - Mini Bar was very expensive. Bottled water was a nice touch, I thought the TV could have done with being a bit bigger personally. We noticed all over the room there was reference to the Executive Lounge so we thought we would give it a try - we tried to get in for Breakfast on the Saturday, only to be told that we were not allowed we had a free upgrade that covered the room but not the lounge - ok, I\u2019m aware that it was pushing our luck a bit, however the way we were told was indefensible. There were several people in the lounge and the Employee that told us had no idea of what the word discretion meant. We didn't know we were not allowed in as nobody told us that - all the media in the rooms told us we could use it. The employee on the desk could not of embarrassed us more, by announcing to pretty much all in the Lounge we were on a free upgrade and not entitled to access.

He told us he would report it to the duty manager, we heard nothing more. No apology, not even an acknowledgement. This and the price of drinks really let the hotel down. we paid \u00a316 for 2 vodka and cokes !!! - we worked out the mini bar is actually cheaper than the bar downstairs - no wonder it was empty ! I'm really loathed to give this a 3 start mark as I'm sure that with a couple of tweaks it could be a really nice hotel, however the communication and the expensive food and drink really let the hotel down.

I threw three items to the dry cleaners on the first morning after check in and they were done by the late afternoon and delivered in gorgeous suit bags--completely first class. Third night I was feeling a bit under the weather--went down to the concierge who recommended a fabulous Indian restaurant, Bengal Quay, which was steps away from the hotel. He didn't have a menu so he walked me over to the restaurant and waited there outside until I ordered! When I told him I was returning in 15 minutes to pick it up, he told me that was nonsense and immediately arranged for the food to be delivered to ME.

The room was very large but maybe this was because it was at the end of the corridor. All the usual amenities you would expect although the towels were not particularly fluffy. The view from the window was excellent - towards the London Eye, although it was a long way away! I was concerned about the noise, but there was no need as it was incredibly quiet and peaceful. I ordered room service and did not eat in the restaurant for lunch - club sandwich was nice, mostly because the chicken was succulent. The toast was a bit dry. This was an overnight business trip, and did not return to the hotel until 23.30. One of the disadvantages of the area is lack of cafes/restaurants/coffee shops that open that late. There is a small centre of shops 2 mins walk from the hotel with the basics but I guess these are only open during the day.

On arrival I had a little bit of trouble finding the entrance to parking garage, but after hanging around like a lemon for few minutes I drove up to a big \"garage door\" and spotted the hotel intercom and the concierge buzzed me in. There was plenty of room to park, and for \u00a320 per night I thought that was reasonable for the neighbourhood. I went upstairs to reception and almost had to beat the concierge off from taking my meagre luggage, they were very service focused! The receptionist was really polite and friendly and helpful and check in was painless. There are three spacious and very smooth lifts (never been in a Mitsubishi lift before) and the corridors upstairs were wide, spacious and nicely decorated. I was shocked when I opened the bedroom door; the room was really large for a London Hotel. Nice modern sleek lines, and a very comfortable bed. Internet was \u00a315 per night, which I thought was a lot so didn't bother, and the phone signal was a bit intermittant too. We were going to head into Canary Wharf for dinner but one of our colleagues was late so we used the hotel restaurant instead. I'm veggie and there were a couple of options for me which was encouraging. The waitress (I wish I'd noted her name) was delightful, very charming and helpful, bringing some warmth to the slightly sterile environment that the modern design of this hotel restaurant. The food was superb, nicely presented, tasty ingredients and some imaginative combinations. For dessert I ordered the trule test of a restaurant, the chocolate fondant. It was perfect, slightly crunchy on the outside but moist on the inside and very very chocolatey!! I had a good night's sleep, and it nice looking out of the window and seeing the bright lights of docklands. Shower was good, and nice bathroom sundries. Checkout was easy, quick and painless (and firiendly). If you turn right out of the hotel entrance on foot, you can walk across to Canary Wharf, which is pretty impressive if you've never seen it before. If you turn left however you'll end up in Millwall Dock, which is interesting but a bit more urban and \"everyday\" in places. There were quite a few lads on bikes wearing hoodies hanging around, not doing anything wrong, but just a warning if you find that kind of thing intimidating (I'm sure there is no need, they looked pretty harmless to me). I paid \u00a3184 room rate (plus VAT), \u00a320 for parking and \u00a345 for dinner, so my total bill was close to \u00a3300.

Really good rooms though and the carpet is much less of a horrid pattern than most hotels. Bathroom was also nice, a reasonable size and the standard of furnishing fairly high for a Hilton.

First of all, the hotel is located a few minutes walk from the Canary Wharf tube stations/DLR, and once on the trains from there, you are a 20-30 min ride to all the major sites. For example, Camden town and Buckingham palace are less than 25 min away. Close to the hotel are little corner stores, like Tesco, for some evening treats and you are a few min walk to Jubilee shopping mall and many other shopping centres with well-known stores like the Gap, etc. The hotel is clean and the breakfast buffet was great and included in the price of the room. The hotel staff was great....they were kind and polite and helped me out when i forgot my plug adapter ;) they brought us up utensils when we needed them and gave us great directions to local attractions. The beds? Comfy, clean.... I did my little inspection of the room before we settled in....A-1! The price was fantastic and cost 400usd for three nights (71 pounds per night) which was much lower than many other hotels I researched. Next time in London, I will stay here.

Great access to the Jubilee line, and make sure you get the river bus into central London just once, the city looks totally different from the river. Great shopping nearby and the area is choc full of restaurants of every type. The hotel is charming; the staff are always excellent, friendly, polite and efficient.

But when you were carrying large luggages, it would be a long way under such a cold and windy weather (You have to cross a bridge). Very bad! 2. We stayed there in weekend. I had heard the Jubilee line might be closed during weekend. That's true! When we went out on Sun, Jubilee line closed. We need to take DLR instead. It took longer way to get into city centre, but actually more relax. 3. Our room located in 4-floor. There was no view at all, facing another buiding and there was construction site in our right hand side. 4. Nothing to eat nearby. Because that was weekend, many shops & restaurants closed early. We had Nando's twice for dinner! 5. Some design errors. You cannot press the flushing button of the toilet if you do not put down the toilet board! Bathtub is large, but the screen is small. You can only utilize 1/3 bathtub when taking shower, not very comfotable! Also, the room seems to be a bit dark. Anyway, I still recommend this hotel to you. It's very new. Breakfast is nice as well.

Stunning surroundings (if you like 21st century scenery) and easy access to DLR (a few hundred yards left as you leave the hotel and in the same direction you can find a nonstop Tesco express) and underground (turn right as you leave the hotel, left when you get to the water, over the bridge, through the glass building - open 24/7 and you cannot miss it - about 5 minutes tops altogether). You will have a problem with parking if you arrive by car. We visited twice in January and each time the car park was closed and we were told there are no spaces available. The hotel will not reserve any for you as part of you booking. If you manage to find a space, it will put you back \u00a325/24 hours. Available parking in the area is in the underground parking at the Britannia Hotel nearby (right on the main street and straight for a few hundred yards - you cannot miss it) where you will pay \u00a321/24 hours. (take the ticket, park the car - when you depart go at Britannia reception and pay) On the down side, the internet is not free and if you linger in the reception in the evening you may be interrogated about your name and room number by security. The rooms are nice and clean, very good size and you can get some spectacular views if you are at a high floor. At level three the over- ground train tracks are by your window but due to very good sound proof windows this will not be an issue. The difference between the normal double and executive is inexistent in term s of room size so it may not worth paying extra for executive unless you want to have a separate shower cubicle to replace the over bath one, to get two small free bottles of water free or bathrobes and sleepers. The Executive lounge is at level 14 and it is a very nice place to enjoy a drink and a snack with a splendid view. However, if you book a double and you manage to get a free upgrade to executive, this will not automatically give you access to the lounge. Ask to be sure and to avoid embarrassment. Staff is very helpful and attentive. We had nothing to complain about. Breakfast in the morning in the downstairs restaurant it can be a bit of hit and miss. It is not the quality or quantity of food. Nothing to complain about except maybe the lack of proper coffee (not instant). The issue may be the number of people and you may need to wait in a queue to be seated and then to get the food. Apart from this no complaints. I think is a great hotel with very nice restaurants near by (see the instructions above on how to get to the tube) and even a Jamie Oliver restaurant in walking distance. Central London can be accessed easily by tube or DLR (direct lines - DLR and Jubilee).

Fantastic hotel, friendly staff and the rooms were lovely. It was spacious, spotless, queen size bed that was so comfy, plasma and even bathrobes and slippers to use whilst there. Bathroom was spacious with shower cubicle, seperate bath, heated mirror so you can still use when bathroom all steamed up and had a speaker in there that was connected to radio next to bed. It was our first weekend away since having a baby 5 months ago and we really enjoyed it there. The drinks in bar quite expensive which we guessed they would be, about \u00a38-9 for a vodka coke, \u00a34-\u00a35 for a pint but smirnoff ice only around \u00a33.50-\u00a34 *** Main thing to be careful with is the minibar in room, every item is on a weight in there so if you put anything in there to keep cold or you take a drink out to look at and put back in you will be charged (this is in very small print at bottom of price list in room). On the sunday we had bill under door saying we owed \u00a360 for drinks we hadnt even had. We put a chocolate bar on top of some wine and they charged us \u00a320!!! I went down to reception and said we had looked at the drinks in there and put back in when we realised price and she refunded all the charges back (luckily). We never had breakfast there but it was \u00a320 each per day and also car parking in secure building next to hotel is \u00a320 a night. Over the footbridge next to hotel takes you to the underground shopping centre, tons of shops, few places to eat like Nandos. Theres a marks and spencers so we stocked up on snacks and drinks to take hotel room. Theres escalator down to tube station and it was one stop away to 02. Takes 2 mins from canary wharf station to 02 arena.

The hotel is close to the DLR (not as close now they have moved the station, but still very easily accessible) which is great for getting around. Our check-in and first impression of the hotel was tainted by the fact we were asked for photo ID (being on home soil we had none and had not be advised during the booking process that we would need any). So UK travelers, please bear this in mind! There is still nothing on the Hilton's Canary Wharf web page about this requirement that I can see. The rooms are a good size, our view at the back on the third floor was rubbish, but we weren't there for the view. If you're there for more than night ask for a room as high up as possible. Disappointed that in a relative new build, there was still lots of noise pollution from the corridor - I believe all hotel rooms should have an inner door! The bathroom was a good size, although the shower in the bath was a little narrow for my liking. For such a decent sized room the television was on the small side and the reception was rubbish. I was also highly suspicious of the fact I could not get any internet access via my mobile in the room. Blocked? Anyway, the Hilton is a good hotel and Canary Wharf remains my favourite area of London, but I would recommend the Marriott over the Hilton if you plan on staying.

The executive lounge experience is nice with great staff and a decent assortment of food throughout the day (breakfast, tea time, dinner). I was particularily pleased with the breakfast and tea time offering. One thing that I was not too impressed with though is the iBanh service that is used for web browsing (complimentary) in the lounge. It is a bit sluggish and prone to bugs... The Hilton London Canary Wharf has a contemporary look and the rooms reflect this. Room size was good and the bathroom + amenities were superior. Although I did not use it, the hotel also features a complete gym. There are some decent views from the hotel / executive lounge and you might be able to get a few great pictures with a poweful zoom.

The two, single beds were right next to each other, not a problem for us, but if you don't want to get too close you can always make a wall with the pillows! Room amenities were ok. It would be nice to have toothbrushes and toothpaste, but a quick call sorted some out. The free optional towels and pillows were waiting in the room. The fancy bath plug was broken which I noted on the comment card, along with my thanks for the good service. The following day I received an email from the Guest Relations Manager as a follow-up which was nice. The best bit for me was the breakfast service: super, friendly staff. The range of food was very good: the usual fry ups, freshly made eggs then fruit, cereal, various fruit juices, danishes, yoghurts, some bran yoghurt stuff, smoked fish plus kippers, more fish, waffles and other items available to order.

I was encouraged by the hotel's appearance, thinking that if the staff took as great of care in preparing the exterior that they would also take great care of their customers. I could not have been more wrong. In the two months I stayed, I had repeated trouble with their front desk staff and billing office. Their policy is to allow your bill to accumulate to a certain point and then pick an arbitrary date on which they would charge a certain amount. This is difficult for business travelers as we often have to itemize our bills and account for every expense on the date it was incurred. I explained the problems this practice was causing me to the billing office and front desk personnel and asked if they could notify me when they were going to charge me so I could prepare my finance reports. All I got in return was a blank stare and \"I'm sorry\"...no explanation or acknowledgment that this practice was causing one of their long-term guests issues. Furthermore, the billing office charged my corporate card 14 times in one day when trying to secure payment (per their idiotic billing protocols) despite my asking them to delay by 2 days so that I could secure additional credit. These 14 charges amount to well over $20,000 and caused my card to be declined for several days. Again, when I expressed my discontent, all they could offer was a blank stare and an empty \"I'm sorry\". The pros of this hotel include a decent gym and modern rooms. The food is edible, but not great. If this is how the hotel staff and management treat their long-term Diamond VIP guests, I'd hate to see how they treat people who are on vacation.

I pushed the boat out and went for the King Size Executive room on the weekend rate. I booked on he Hilton website an hour before we arrived, very smooth and efficient. I didn't like the fact they add the tax on afterwards so the prices do look a bit misleading to start. The check in process was quick and easy. I could have gone direct to to the 14th floor to check in at the executive lounge but the ground floor reception was empty. Reception looked quite small and could be congested during the week but on this saturday it was fine. The onsite basement car park is \u00a320 per 24 hours on a first come first served basis. The concierge was helpful and gave us a local map and offered to point out where we wanted to go. The hotel is conveniently located for all the central Canary Wharf shops, restaurants and bars. All are a short walk away. Our room on the 14th floor was a good size, clean, new and modern. It had everything we needed, including a good view of the river and docklands skyline. A couple of small bottles of complimentary water were gratefullly received and a nice touch. The flat screen TV needs to be bigger but was adequate. TV channels were OK and included Sky Sports 1 and 2 which is an added bonus. The lighting was good and the blackout curtains were very effective on a bright sunny morning. The bed, duvet and pillows were good quality and gave a good nights sleep. The excellent bathroom was large with a separate bath tub and large shower cubicle. The toilet was a bit close to the wall at the side but this is only a minor problem. The power of the shower was a bit disappointing but it did the job. Complimentary toiletries from Crabtree and Evelyn were high quality and put to good use. Bath towels were large and fluffy, in fact too fluffy and bits came off! This is a minor fault that will presumably sort itself out. In addition there were big bath robes and slippers. We used the exec lounge for complimentary afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks. The lounge is comfortable, has great views of the city and had very pleasant and friendly staff. They could do with a few more comfy chairs as i suspect it gets busy during the business week. The food and drink selection were fine and in my opinion worth the extra cost. We used the bar on the ground floor after we had been out for a meal at Jamies Italian (see my review). The bar is a modern style and best if you can grab a comfy sofa rather than the square stools, or high bar stools which look a bit uncomfortable to a man of my age. Service was OK but they looked a bit understaffed and had to clear the table for us to it down. I assume they have more staff during the business week when it gets busy. I made the mistake of pre-paying an extra \u00a315 for the two of us to have the full breakfast in the ground floor restaurant. The exec lounge only does a continental style inclusive breakfast, or so I thought. They did actually have hash browns, bacon, sausage and scrambled egg which would have been enough for us. The full price for breakfast in the main restaurant is \u00a320.95. Call me a tight wad but that price is extortionate and the quality at best was average. I had to get my coffee replaced because it was served luke warm. Maybe a one off and the waitress did apologise. I should have asked the chef to fry some fresh eggs for me. I mistakenly took the dried up ones on display and they were not good. If they want to charge top dollar for the brekkie they need to improve the quality and choice considerably to get anywhere near value for money. If I return I would eat out or upgrade to the exec floor again. The hotel is modern and stylish and has a boutique look and feel to it.

For me this turned out fine as the dates of my stay were firm. - Canary Wharf is a modern office district with thousands of white collars flowing in by DLR and subway every morning. Personally, I prefer the quiet evening environment to the bustle downtown, even if it means to get into the tube myself. The hotel is so close to both DLR and subway that I would not even accept the umbrella offered by the concierge on rainy days. - Rooms and bathrooms are spacious and cater for business travellers. Fine with me as long as my room has a river view to relax after dinner. I found dinner very nice and always ate at the hotel.

It took about 25 mins from hotel to Leicester Square. So for price this is a very small compromise to us! Breakfast is lovely and best to get it in with your room rate as it's very expensive otherwise. All staff here are very friendly from reception, to the maids. Canary Wharf as a location is great too, there is a really nice shopping mall nearby with many high street shops (like Boots, Waterstones etc...) and a food court, and as a bonus at weekends it's very quiet! although during the week there are some 70,000+ workers in the area, so guess it could be a little manic!

We then got straight in the enormous super fast lifts to our 9th floor room which was overlooking the Thames and the Bridge. The room was absolutely massive, with double bed, comfortable chair, desk incorporating a hair dryer, mini bar (items at cost), tea and coffee making facilities with biscuits, television, alarm clock with radio, an array of lamps and lighting and a good sized wardrobe with an iron and ironing board and a safe. The bathroom again was a lovely size, shower was brilliant and plenty of fresh clean towels, they also supplied us with lovely Crabtree and Evelyn shower gel and shampoo etc. The breakfast was fantastic again, seated straight away and offered tea and/or coffee and orange juice at the table, after that it is just a help yourself buffet with a great variety of hot and cold foods and different juices. They also offer pancakes, belgian waffles and porridge at your request, we had the pancakes both days and they were lovely and came to us within 3 minutes. All in all the hotel is perfect, not only that but the location to the Canary Wharf Tube is only a 5-10 minute stroll, and if your going quickly it only takes 3 minutes as we found out. The shopping centre is also connected to the tube station and this itself would take a whole day to get around.

Being HHonors gold we considered the Hilton Canary Wharf and the Hilton Docklands. Although the latter having a pool, we opted fot this one - being more conveniently located and must admit: we were not at all disappointed. It took us only 20 minutes from bagage claim to check-in of the hotel. We were invited to check - in upstairs, since we got upgraded from standard guestroom to an executive room. The room had everything we would expect from a decent hotel room with a very good bed on the positive side but no possibility to open the window and an uninspiring view of a highrise under construction on the down side. Very surprisingly the hotel does not offer WiFi in your room, only cable connections ad GBP 15 p/day. I would like to stress though, that we were very positively surprised about the consistent very high levels of service we encountered. All members of staff we met went out of their ways to accomodate our requests concerning pE later check-outs or special requests for housekeeping. After a stressfull day, this cannot be valued enough. Location of the property is good. DLR South Quay is in front of the hotel and Canary Wharf tube station is a 5min walk via the footbridge. The nearby mall (Canada sq) has a decent amount of shops and restaurants and if you intend to self-cater there is a 24h ASDA Supermarket 8mins or 1 DLR station away. We used breakfast in the lounge - it was a standard Hilton-breakfast, good quality and a decent choice. At the end of the morning some more attention could be given to stocking up items which already ran out. Once we had tea in the lounge, which was excellent. Very abundant choice of sandwhiches and sweets/cakes were available. All in all I would definately recommend this hotel for business travellers and tourists who not necessarily want to be in central London all time.

The bathroom was good sized with a big tub and a full assortment of shampoos. We knew that we were going to get breakfast with the room but were very surprised to find that it was a full buffet breakfast. The buffet had everything one could possibly want including someone who made omlets to order, all types of cereals, pancakes, french toast, fruits, lox, assortments of juices, even sparkling water. It was better than one could find on a cruise. The rate we got for all this was excellent since Hilton had a special, stay one night, get one night free. I must commend the conceirge staff. They were incredibly helpful, answering any questions and making reservations as needed always pleasantly. The staff made the stay excellent. Only thing to watch out for are extra charges. The internet is expensive as is use of the minibar. Make sure you don't store anything in the minibar, since I put a little yogurt in it and they charged 9.5 pounds additional, but later removed the charge. They do have a free gym though but one must pay to use the business center. The location at Canary Wharf is a little out of the way of Central London, but there is an underground station very near by and the area contains many stores and restaurants.

I hope you will find this useful. Reception: Check in was fast (less than 5 minutes). Staff was high standard: multilingual personnel, always smiling and asking if any more help was needed. Hotel appearance: To me it looked very \"business\" stile: typical hotel like from the 80s decorations, nothing peculiar. Elevators are relatively big and fast: there are 3, always working. Lobby is wide; floor is polished and all is very clean. Floor status: Carpet all over the corridors, clean. No peculiar decorations. Smell a little to old wood. Room: Big enough for me, but I do understand that standards can vary. Bed was double size, with 2 side tables and enough space to move around it. Big mirrors, and writing desk included. Big windows (half the wall) with long double curtains, all the way down to the floor. Bathroom not too big, but with bathtub, toilet, shower, etc. Towels were always clean. Products are provided every day. They seem good quality ones to me. Environment: notes about caring for the environment can be found in the room, which I thought was nice... even if it would be nicer if we paid attention to them and tried to really care for environment. Breakfast: Served on time. Staff is awesome and nice. They will accompany the customer to the table, and provide them with coffee, tea and orange juice. The rest is buffet style. Food quality was more than fine to me. Negative spot: milk is served cold, which will make your coffee cold quickly. You can have hot milk, but you will have to request it. Continental and full English breakfast are offered (for now, check for availability when you book): you can have all that you want. Room Service: I asked for room service twice. The first was Greek salad, burger, salmon wrap, prawn cocktail. Everything was nice. Negative Spot: the Greek salad came with lots of onion and peppers. So, 2 things: it did NOT say those ingredients in the menu and Greek salad traditional recipe does not come with such ingredients. Second time, club sandwich, Caesar salad, salmon side dish, \"antipasta\". So, they write \"antipasta\" instead of \"antipasto\" in the menu. Caesar salad was very bad: lettuce was not well opened, sot the leaves came attached all together with one another in the plate. Dressing was strange: I'm not sure how to describe it, maybe it had too much garlic, but the problem was the lettuce, it was bitter, hard and way too cold, almost uneatable. I did not turned it back, because I know it can be a one-day-incident. Staff: really, staff was awesome, from reception, to room service, to restaurant, all of them: if life has been good to you be kind to them as they are with us customers, they are doing a job not being slaves. It's really upsetting when I see someone treating bad a waiter: the fact that they are at your service does not mean they're your servants.

Our room was fantastic - exceptionally clean, spacious and fab contemporary decor. The bathroom was large, modern and sparkling clean. There was a great selection of toiletries etc and it was one of the few hotels I have been to where every single item we used was actually replenished the next day - it is so annoying when you use cotton wool pads to remove make up and the next day there are no new ones. Bathrobes and slippers were provided, complimentary mineral water and choccies on the pillows. The location is great for both the underground and DLR stations - unfortunately the Jubilee line was closed when we were there but if everything is working it is an absolutely fantastic place to stay if you are going to the O2 arena and the Jubilee Place shopping centre is a stone's throw away with French Connection, Reiss, Karen Millen - we were in heaven! Service from the staff was great and it was nice to use the sauna/steam room - the only way this hotel could be improved would be to have a swimming pool but that is honestly the only thing I could complain about!

The service was really good from the moment we stepped into the hotel to our checkout. The twin rooms, we occupied were a standard for our first stay and an executive for the return trip. Both types of rooms were good and spacious. The beds were comfortable but the mattresses were thinner than some of the other Hilton hotels we stayed in the USA. The bathroom in the standard room had a glass door in place of a shower curtain and one had to push out the glass door in order to step in or out of the tub. It appeared a bit tricky initially to whether to push the glass door in or out of the tub and how to support oneself after a shower. However, once we got over the first shower, it was alright. In the executive room, there was a separate shower and a bathtub. Just an observation though not a problem for us ( we sleep late at night), was one evening we heard footsteps coming from above our executive room on the 13th floor. On checking we found that our room was below some private rooms in the corridor next to the 14th floor executive lounge. If you are a light sleeper, avoid being assigned those few rooms. The staff we encountered from the people manning the concierge desk, reception, executive lounge and ground floor restaurant were not only helpful, friendly and warm toward us but were also perceived to be \"nice and helpful\" to each other. People could be professional and go about doing their jobs but the staff here appeared to be really working as a team. At the reception area one evening, I saw a guest who had just arrived being greeted warmly by a staff member from the concierge desk. However, the guest was really rude and ignored the staff member, who just smiled and went back to the desk. I thought that encounter was handled very well by the staff member, who probably did not take it personally. There was a good spread for breakfast and lots of fruits during our stay. There was access to the Executive Lounge throughout the day until 11 pm with snacks, drinks and free internet access when we stayed in the executive room. The DLR South Quay is situated next to the hotel and is convenient for trips to the Docklands area. The Tube is about 5 to 7 minutes walk away... a short walk from the hotel, over a footbridge and into Jubilee Place and across the road to the station to take the Jubilee Line. The short walk was more enjoyable on days when it was not so windy. On windy days, we took the DLR from South Quay to Heron Quays just one stop away and changed to the Tube or vice versa on coming back to the hotel. This was because we used the Oyster cards which allowed us to make unlimited trips, capped at a certain amount daily. The DLR stations are not manned and one must not forget and just get on the train without tapping the card at the \"Touch In/Out\" buttons. We were also told to place the card over the \"Touch in/out\" button at the DLR stations for at least 2 seconds for it to register, when one of our cards did not validate at the South Quay DLR station. The location of the hotel is quiet, away from noise and crowd of Central London. It is a fairly long ride by Dot2Dot to and from Heathrow Airport but we enjoyed the sightseeing along the way.\"", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, Virginia", "Title": "\u201c#1 choice to stay on our next visit to London\u201d", "Author": "ZetaOne", "ReviewID": "UR31436627", "Content": "My husband and I traveled for two weeks on vacation in Europe.

Out of all Hiltons in London this is likely in the Top 3. Still not quite 5 stars as such since in my books those are reserved for those \u00dcber Luxury pampering hotels such as Peninsula or Four Seasons. IMHO a bit too far away to really compete with central London hotels as such, but this one is far superior to Hilton Docklands nearby. Review is based on one night stay in May\u201909 (background of spending 80+ nights per year in different hotels around the globe) Location: Personally I would say this is a little bit too far from the \u201cnormal\u201d sights of central London such as Oxford Street, British Museum etc. Also Heathrow is quite a long way from here. If the intention is to use the City Airport (maybe 15min DLR light railway ride away) and spend time in o2 Arena or Greenwich then of course the location is really ideal. Nearby is Canary Wharf mall, a couple of pubs and restaurants. Room: As HHonors Diamond member I was upgraded to an Executive Floor room in 13th floor which was OK size (globally speaking, big in London standards), very modern and spotlessly clean (as was the rest of the hotel). Welcome package included two bottles of water and a small selection of sweets. Bathroom was quite large with separate sections for bath and shower. Some noise from the DLR train even in 13th floor since the DLR track is basically hugging the hotel wall, apart from that there was very little noise. Service: The Executive Lounge was quite big and had a relatively good offering, including warm \u201clight evening buffet\u201d with rather large assortment of different complimentary alcohol beverages (between 6pm and 9pm). Lounge offers some nice views from the 14th floor towards Thames and central London sights such as London Eye. A special honorable mention must be given to the lounge for serving also the wonderful London Pride in addition to the normal tasteless bulk lager beers, first time ever in any Hilton Lounge! Check-in and check-out handled in the lounge. Etc: Breakfast in the lounge was quite OK, better and more extensive selection than in many other lounges encountered so far. Obviously downstairs in the \u201creal breakfast\u201d there likely would be more selection but for me this one did its job just fine. Didn\u2019t try restaurant or gym so cannot comment them.

Cosy king size bed, free coffee and tea making facilities, slippers and robes, minibar, room service menu, free newspaper en free bottle of water every day. Also turn down service some nights. LOUNGE: thi is the real plus side: in this lounge they serve breakfast but also snacks and drinks for free! Well worth the upgrade fee! During the day they had biscuits and cookies out, fruit and you could make coffe or tea of just grab from the fridge with sodas. Around 3pm, they made for High Tea with sanwiches and cakes. After 6 pm they put out hot snacks, cold snacks, cheese and crackers, potatoe chips, fruit and nuts.

Mid-size lobby that expands back into the hotel restaurant area. Overall, a great top quality modern hotel for comfortable stays when visiting London. Particularly great if you get a great rate during non-business dates and prefer comfort and space over the \"history and charm\" of some of London's older, more British, hotel options. (which can be great, in their own different way) Room: Spacious, modern and very comfortable. Sitting area in each room and top quality linens, interiors and bathrooms. Big plate-glass windows overlooking the Thames (and rather industrial/business neighborhood). Location: As Canary Wharf is a business area, this neighborhood can be quite deserted during non-business hours. My stay, over Easter weekend 2008, found the neighborhood empty and the hotel only partly full. However, this didn't detract from the stay, as transportation throughout London was easy using the DLR rail, Tube, taxi or even the nighbus from the lively neighborhoods of Central London. Breakfast: Wonderful, large breakfast including all staples of a British breakfast (beans, ham, hard-boiled eggs, etc), an American breakfast (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, etc), the pastries of a French breakfast or the fruits and juices and grain breads of a health-conscious breakfast. Staff: Professional, friendly and outgoing. Transportation: Very easy, with the DLR rail stop directly outside whisking you into the popular neighborhoods of central London in 10-20min. Nightbus back from bars of SoHo was easy, cheap and fast, dropping off just a few hundred meters from the hotel.

This would have been easy on the metropolitan line if it were not for the maintenance work. You walk through a shopping precinct at the Canary Wharf underground stop to get to the hotel; there is an exit for the hotel by paper chase. You cross a bridge over the Thames and the hotel is there on your left. The entrance is very modern and clean. We arrived at the hotel at around 1, as check-in was 4 we were apprehensive of if we were ok to check-in. The reception said our room was ready and we got our card and headed to the eighth floor. The room was very spacious and had a nice bathroom. It took us a while to figure it out but if you turn the tap right the bath works and if you turn it left the shower comes on. We went shopping in the precinct after checking in and had some dinner at one of the caf\u00e9\u2019s there are plenty of shops as you go through for all your needs. There is also a Krispy Kreme donut shop which is well worth a trip especially for the apple and cinnamon flavour.

It is a few mins walk from the tube station (Jubilee line \u2013 takes about 15 mins to South Bank), and about 15 mins walk from the river taxi (which is an excellent method for getting to London Embankment or across to Greenwich). There is a seemingly endless amount of shops, fast food outlets, and cafes in the nearby (underground) shopping mall, where weekdays you can mix with London\u2019s financial whizz kids from the Canary Wharf buildings. Not to be overlooked for eating out is the small array of restaurants along the water\u2019s edge at Westferry Circus (where the river taxi stop is) \u2013 especially nice at night when you can see the lights of the City buildings reflected in the water.

And it was even better than my expectations; we had a true fantastic weekend break in this Hilton Canary Wharf. From Heathrow airport we took the metro, first the Picadilly line and on Green Bank we switched to the Jubilee line. It takes in all about one hour and 15-20 minutes and it goes not totally underground. On the Canary Wharf station go up with the high elevators, outside turn left, walk trough the glass (Jubilee) building, pass a pedestrian bridge and you will see the Hilton slightly on your left. It is just a 5-minute walk. Inside everything is very modern and there were many people lounging in the Cinnamon Bar and Caf\u00e9 on this late Friday afternoon, giving it all a relaxing atmosphere. We were directed to the 14th floor with the executive lounge for my Diamond Hilton status. We received a warm welcome and check-in went smooth. Before we went to our room we had an excellent cup of coffee together with some snacks. Every afternoon they serve cakes, pastries and sandwiches and it all looked and tasted very good. Our room was very comfortable, with a high quality King bed, an easy chair with ottoman and a working desk with chair. There was plenty of wardrobe space, coffee/tea facilities and two complimentary bottles of water. With check-in we were asked which newspaper we would prefer and to our surprise we already found an issue in our room. (These are the small details that make this hotel more than excellent.) The bathroom was spacious and clean with separate bath and shower. We went back to the executive lounge for the happy hour (from 6:00 till 8:00 p.m.), with all kinds of alcoholic drinks for free. The quality of the food presented with it was surprisingly good, with a variety of cold and hot items. There were even healthy snacks, grilled vegetables on a stick. In the lounge are two computers available for free Internet. We had an arrangement with breakfast and dinner. For the dinner they offer a 3-course meal and we could make a choice of about six for each course. The food was absolutely delicious and also service here was great. On both evenings Geerjanneke from the Netherlands and Hoon from South Korea served us, two enthusiastic young persons with the proper skills and dignity. There is a good wine selection, the first evening we had a bottle or red wine, the second we made our choice by the glass. It was expensive, but not extremely and the quality was very good. Only the tables are rather small in the restaurant. On return we found our bed prepared, two bathrobes and slippers and some chocolates. Breakfast was outstanding as well; we had it in the Cinnamon restaurant with our arrangement. What we saw in the executive lounge was also good. Going to Greenwich with the Maritime Museum and Royal Observatory is very easy; the station for the DLR (sort of light rail) is next to the hotel. Also going to the center of London is no problem, with the Jubilee line it is only about 12 minutes to Westminster station (Big Ben, Changing of the Horse Guards etc.). As I mentioned before we had a superb weekend and would choose this hotel whenever we would be in London again.

The rooms are large and comfortable, and a nice touch is that bottled water is waiting in the room when you arrive, and replenished on our second day. The price of the bottled water in the hotel has been commented on elsewhere, but if you ask the restaurant staff for \"tap water\" they will happily oblige. We loved the buffet dinner which was included as part of our room deal for the first night - possibly the best buffet I've ever seen with a wonderful selection of starters, main courses and desserts. Having just returned from a holiday in the States where healthy eating was not high on the agenda, it was great to be able to help myself to a variety of fresh vegetables and fruit. It was also nice to help myself to two desserts! The service at the restaurant was good. We were so impressed with the dinner buffet, we opted to dine in the hotel again on our second night. The breakfasts have been commented on in other reviews, and I have to agree they are great. A great selection of cereals, full cooked breakfast and a large choice of fruit and continental-style breakfasts, and loads of cakes and pastries. Absolutely fantastic. We had a couple of problems during our stay, but these were dealt with in such a professional and courteous manner, it would be harsh to even mention them. A few of the other reviews have raised points I'd like to cover... The hotel, in my opinion, is not difficult to find. It is right next to South Quay DLR station, and just a short stroll from Canary Wharf tube station. I didn't have my stopwatch with me, but I find it hard to believe it was even a 5-minute walk, it is literally just round over a footbridge and then through a building's foyer. There is certainly no need to get a taxi from the hotel to the station, as one reviewer said! The restaurant is not like a caf\u00e9. I found it to be a stylish place to eat, wih fantastic food and excellent staff. There is a safe in the bedroom, and whenever I was around the hotel entrance there were at least two members of staff on duty, so I don't know why security should be an issue. The only time we were aware of the DLR noise was when drinking in the bar on the ground floor. We didn't hear anything from our bedroom, and weren't even aware of it in the restaurant although I guess you probably can hear it from there if you listen out for it. I find it quite funny that two constant themes seem to crop up in reviews for this hotel - firstly, that it is not conveniently located and is a walk to the Jubilee line station, and then secondly that it is too noisy because it is situated next to a DLR station. I used to live in the docklands area, and loved using the DLR. Jubilee line might be quicker, but the DLR is so much nicer as the trains run mostly above ground.

Both times I started the week with breakfast in the hotel - and after seeing what it costs, I decided to pick up breakfast in one of the shops in the underground shopping center that runs under the office buildings. I do have to say that the hotel was extremely generous with an ultra-late check out (5pm-ish) for a very minimal charge. This made a huge difference as it allowed me to relax, workout, shower, etc. in the comfort of my private room before departing on the very long haul back to Australia (and work would not have paid for an additional night for this purpose). I would request this hotel again for this reason if I went back to Canary Wharf for work and this is the reason why I'm giving it an above average.

A previous reviewer is right in that the area all around Canary Wharf is a building site at the moment -but the rooms are so comfortable to sleep in with good size TV and generous beverage tray - and most people who visit London do not stay around the hotel all day looking out of the window. The DLR station is right opposite the hotel and all the lines were working fine when we were visiting. You can be in the greenery at Greenwich within a few stops or to the Tower of London in 10 to 15 minutes - just be careful which train you get on - the instructions are a little confusing but this is not the fault of the Hilton. The station is not manned so an oyster card would save a lot of confusion with tickets if you are there for a few days. The Hilton staff are young, smiling and efficient. However, I will be contacting the hotel to suggest that they add more local maps and knowledge to their information base - nobody could give us information as to where our friends holiday townhouse was - just two or three blocks away -and we had to go ask a local estate agent! These are just small niggles which did not spoil our stay - the towels and bathrobes were replaced each day - I dropped the shower head - the taxi we ordered arrived in 3 minutes flat - a brand new estate . Just a note if you are driving to the hotel - they have garaging but due to the one ways and constuction work around there seems absolutely no parking elsewhere and and our cab from Kings Cross could not find it - so you will need good directions too.

(Given the low value of the dollar vs the pound right now, this was a huge money saver, and also if you are jet lagged and hungry at odd hours, you could easily get a light snack or beverage).

It was really nicely furnished and the bathroom was lovely. Both spotlessly clean. I rate the standard of this hotel very highly, I really felt like it was a weekend of luxury. The staff are so nice and friendly and always greet you with a smile. Towels were changed every day and they have a turndown service. We came back in the evening to find the curtains drawn, bed turned down, little chocolates on the pillow and bottles of water on the table which are complimentary. When we arrived there was a bottle of still and a bottle of sparkiling water on the table which was complimentary. When the come in to turn down your bed they provide more if you have used what is there. This was a really nice touch. We chose this hotel because it was close to the O2 Dome, where we were seeing Prince (who was great!). It's an ideal location for the Dome, as the Jubilee line is a couple of minutes walk from the hotel and the Dome is only 1 stop away. Canary Wharf is a really nice area with a shopping mall, bars and restaurants nearby and the area itself felt very safe. Some people mentioned that it's a bit out of London, but we didn't find this a problem. It's a lovely area to stay in and with the tube station so closeby you can be in the centre of London in no time. We flew into London City Airport and took the DLR (Docklands Light Railway) to South Quay which is just outside the hotel. If you're going out and about buy a day pass for the tube, this day pass includes the use of the DLR.

It was a well decorated room with everything you could ask for clock radio, DVD player even scales in the bathroom! The bed was also huge and extreemly comfy. We used the execuitive floor for breakfast again everything you could wish for and plenty of choice. We were able to use this room anytime we wished for drinks or snacks. Also available were a couple of computers if you needed them. The hotel is very well situated for the Tube and the Docklands Light railway, it took us about 10 minutes and we were in the heart of the city.", "Date": "May 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The World", "Title": "\u201cLove it!!!!\u201d", "Author": "terravisum", "ReviewID": "UR7478868", "Content": "I checked in over the Easter weekend for a 3 nights. I arrived at the hotel pretty early around 10:30 AM and at the front desk was notified that I have been upgraded to the Exec floor and hence would need to checked in using the Executive Lounge on the 14th florr. As it is too early in the morning, my room has not been readied so I was invided to have breakfast in the lounge while my room is being prepared. The executive room is a large size with furniture in dark modern oriental color, quite pleasing to the eyes. The bed is plush with several pillows in various firmness support. There is a safe in the room to keep your valuables. Bathroom is large with separate shower and bath, stocked with the excellent Crabtree & Evelyn products. The lighting is a bit subdued for my taste. The amenities are very complete with a digital weight scale. There is a loose tile in my bathroom. The lounge is clean bright and modern look. It also has a skyview to the London skyline abeit from afar. The morning breakfast in the lounge is a combination of cold cuts, scramble eggs, sausages and English bacon. The afternoon tea has cookies and some cakes. Evening snack is canapees, egg rolls, chicken wings and satay skewers pedending on the day. There is a Capucino machine, still and sparking water as well as a mini-fridge with assorted sodas. The morning breakfast also have orange, grapefruit and pinaples juice available. The hotel is kept very tidy and service is done in a quiet manner. It is one of the better Hilton that I have stayed so far. The location is also good with a quick 15 minutes tube ride to central London away to the hussle of downtown London or using the DLR to the Bank station.", "Date": "April 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, UK", "Title": "\u201cHilton is OK\u201d", "Author": "Coops60", "ReviewID": "UR7474263", "Content": "We stayed here for one night in April 07 as my wife was running the London Marathon. We were upgraded to the executive suites which was good, the room is big and bed was great.

We were offered a free breakfast in the executive lounge but this wasn\u2019t until 8.00am, far too late for the marathon so we asked if we could have it downstairs in the normal restaurant which we weren\u2019t able to do, which seems a bit odd. Good shopping to be had at Jubilee Place and Canary wharf (nearest tube station) and DLR seemed Ok (broke down though on marathon day!). The DLR is right outside the hotel and lower rooms will be opposite it, if you are a light sleeper make sure you request a room away from this!
