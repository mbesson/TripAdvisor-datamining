All these places are reachable by walking. The hotel is not very clean. The room vith a basin is good advantage. The walls between rooms are rather thin, so I had to punch it when a guy behind it started to sing.

The walls are as thin as paper, so you can hear everything. It's very safe. You drop off your key at the front desk, and must ring the doorbell to re-enter. If you arrive after 11pm, you are given a special card stating that you are staying at the hostal. You must present it to a security guard downstairs, and he will take you all the way up to your hostal, give you your key, and let you in. Mother and father don't speak English, but the son does.
