First impression was \"this is odd\" as I had to ring the doorbell to get in (at 3pm in the afternoon). The next odd thing was reception wanting photo confirmation of my ID and address and taking a photo copy of my driver's licence. It's lucky I happened to have it on me as I don't make a habit of carrying my passport around in my home country! I've never been asked for this before at a UK hotel...Anyway on to the room; first impression was hot and way too perfumed; easily rectified by asking the staff to take away the 2 perfume diffusers and opening the door onto the small balcony. The room (101 a \"deluxe double\") was large and decorated in a very fussy, camp style - imagine 1980's House and Garden magazine - all swags and tails, throw cushions galore and gilded mirrors. The bathroom was very small compared to the bedroom, rather basic and had cracked floor tiles and chipped paintwork. The bath side toiletries were San Domenico own label - but half used! There were 2 Moulton Brown miniatures too - but again some missing from one of them. The over fussy touches continued with sprigs of lavender on the pillows and strangest of all a handful of rose petals in the loo pan! We didn't eat here, but I had a pot of tea and some biscuits on arrival which arrived promptly and were very nice. The king sized bed was OK but set on very mobile castors which meant is slid away when you tried to sit on it! The next morning the shower was very disappointing \u2013 plenty of pressure but a terrible shower head which drenched the bathroom floor and seemed to miss most of me. All in all I'd rather the management fussed less about lavender and rose petals and provided better TVs with more than 4 channels, upgraded the bathrooms and took away the perfume. San Domenico House is probably a very nice experience if you appreciate camp and fussy decor, don\u2019t mind not having a decent TV, iPod dock or WiFi - but sadly it's not for me.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in fab location\u201d", "Author": "kdw0908", "ReviewID": "UR125522689", "Content": "We stayed for a 2 night break at San Domenico House.

I can't understand other reviews criticizing the hospitality. I was very happy with every aspect of my stay but especially by the personal and polite service that I experienced from everyone at SDH. I feel they went over and above their duty and especially what I would have expected. Obviously location, cleanliness, and room were perfect. To be helpful and give a balanced review there was a little street noise (room 101) but nothing major and a bit of noise one morning from the room above us walking around and then being hoovered, but again not major.

The bedroom was a deluxe mini suite with galleried landing with sofa and table, bathroom was spacious and felt luxurious, overall we had a feeling that we had lots of space. Room service was extremely prompt with a huge tray of tea, toast and preserves priced at \u00a38 for two,would be a bargain anywhere in Europe we felt! The location is perfect, 2mins from Peter Jones/ Sloane St/ Sloan Sq/ Kings Rd/ Tube etc...there were gorgeous restaurants in walking distance - you must try the prawn & courgette linguini at San Lorenzo on Beauchamp Place!

The hotel is very personal with lots of antiques and it feels more like a privat guesthouse than a hotel. Service, though, was impeccable - extremely friendly staff. Since the hotel is owned by an Italian family, most of the staff has an Italian background, which is quite funny in London, but definitely charming. The room I stayed in was very large for London standards, individually and luxuriously furnished (loved the Louis Vuitton vintage suitcases) and very clean. It even had a nice roof terrace which I can imagine to be really nice in the summer. Breakfast in the morning was served either in the room (mine had a nice seating area) or in the breakfast room in the basement, which I thought at first to be strange but turned out to be quite cozy.
