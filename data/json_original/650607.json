It's an experience. It is an easy three block walk from the largest train station in Rome. Part of the walk is down an alley that is decorated with graffiti. Unfortunately, that is not unusual in even the best parts of Italy. It is easy to miss the hotel entrance, as it is barely a break in the wall, but once you enter the glass door, it feels like you step into Rome of the past. The small lobby is clean and quaint. We were warmly greeted and escorted to a suspended wrought iron elevator right out of the movie \"Inception\". Our room was at the end of a long narrow hallway, but again, it was clean and felt safe. The room was very tiny only about 10x10 with the bed taking up most of the space. It felt almost like a cruise ship cabin. But there was a desk, chair, closet and room to unpack. Bed was comfortable.The bathroom was on the small side too, but clean with modern fixtures. The best part was opening up the ancient wooded shutters and being able to literally breathe in Rome spread out below. Breakfast was a few pastries, what looked like hotdogs and boiled eggs. They did have a good coffee machine and juice. We never saw another person at breakfast, either staff or guests at breakfast, which was a little puzzeling. Overall, this is a cute little place that is adequate for sleep and shower at the end of a long day of sight seeing.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cGood location but nothing more\u201d", "Author": "pkrasn", "ReviewID": "UR124003270", "Content": "The hotel has good location next to Termini Station with convienient connections to each part of Rome but this is the only adventage.

The location is fantastic, so close to Termini station and within easy walking distance of the Coliseum and Forum. The rooms were basic but clean although the bathroom was tiny and the shower was quite temperamental. The only problem I had with this hotel was that the breakfast is only just adequate. The coffee was horrible and out of a machine and there were no tea bags for the duration of the stay. There was one loaf of fresh bread which you had to cut yourself and, unless you got there early, the yoghurts vanished! The reception staff were super friendly and helpful at all times but there was one member of staff who was most unpleasant and who shouted at our pupils when their key broke in the door of their bedroom. He seemed to think it was their fault, when it obviously was not. Another lovely man came however, and worked for a considerable amount of time to get the broken key out of the door and let the girl into her room.

We had booked a \"superior\" room as having a 17 month old baby we thought we'd pay the bit extra for more space in the room considering the cot as well as our own bed. The website showed a spacious looking room which we presumed was the superior. On arriving late at night with all our luggage and the baby in the buggy, we discovered that to get to the reception on the first floor we needed the lift. Problem was, that lift needed a key to open it. Which was available at reception!! We dragged everything upstairs and were greeted by an unfriendl receptionist who completed our check in in virtual silence giving us little or no information about the hotel's facilities (subsequently we found there are none) Up we trekked to the 4th floor via the 300yr old lift and discovered that to get into the corridor you need to buzz reception and wait. Same to get in and out of all doors all over the hotel. Ridiculous. Our room was to our shock, tiny. We had barely enough room to walk around the bed. It was sweltering hot although the website had said superior rooms had A.C. This we were told was an extra \u20ac15 per night. Oh by the way, breakfast in this awful place was a further \u20ac15 per breakfast!! I complained at the end of our stay that the superior room was a joke, that we had nothing extra to the standard. A very rude female who I found out afterwards was the owner informed me that we had a safe in the room, the OPTION of A.C and a fridge (this was empty). That made it superior. To add insult to injury, my parents who had reserved a standrd room were put up in a palatial huge room complete with jacuzzi! It turned out Hotel Dina had run out of space so they were put in the hotel attached, the Terni. She was argumentative to the last and thoroughly unpleasant to deal with. We paid our money and left vowing never to return. The area it is in by the way is dodgy to say the least and dangerous to walk around in at night.

High level of street noise can be heard throughout the night. Hotel is also showing its age. We had a quad room and was very tight with beds built for hobbits.

That was a nice enough hotel at the same price as the Dina but almost 1 a hour journey each way on public transport from the Termini station. We were staying over the 1st of May holiday weekend and found accommodation hard to come by on the internet (and City centre hotels can be very pricey) so we found the Dina just by walking in and checking if they had a place. The exterior does look a rather dingy and at first we felt we were chancing it but found it internally to be clean with an old fashioned charm. The room we had was small but recently decorated and priced accordingly at 65E without breakfast, and it was clean and quiet, staff helpful enough, and is positioned only 200m from the Termini station so it's right in the heart of where you want to be. Being our first trip to Rome and booking it at short notice we didn't have much time to research the areas for accommodation but we were very satisfied with what we stumbled on and if this is your price range then we would definately recommend this hotel. The area is safe enough and as said it's really well sited for walking / bussing or Metroing it to all of the sites. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but there are loads nearby and our recommendation is to opt out of breakfast (which is extra at 15E per person per day) which they serve in their breakfast room and do what the Romans do and pop out to the plethora of local cafes and have your coffee & pastries there. We found a great friendly cafe only 50m away serving a coffee & pastry for 3E per person if you do as they do and stand at the bar, although there's a 3E cover surcharge of you sit to eat.
