If you have a car then there are a number of places within a few minutes. The lobby area is fairly nice and the front desk staff were helpful. There is covered parking but the access from the parkade to the hotel is not very convenient and was incredible dirty. You may end up in a hallway with several 90 degree turns before you get in the hotel. The rooms are updated but there are signs of loose flooring, poor sealing in the shower and fixtures that are worn. The HVAC doesn't seem to have been improved at all. I'm not sure I get this brand in the Priority Club scheme. From a required points perspective it seems like it should be on the more upscale side yet this property seems like a converted motel. The rooms are updated with hardword floors and a decent decor but I have been in many Holiday Inn Express hotels for less money/points that are much newer and better appointed. I will probably continue to stay but only for 1 night at a time to sleep before a flight.

At the desk, I was greeted by a friendly and efficient desk staff that made check-in fast but had to make me aware of the $10 charge for parking. A little disappointed with that but they have to pay for the parking garage I guess. The room was brightly appointed with unique murals and bed stand lamps. The bathroom was unique in that there was no fully closed shower stall, just a half glass barrier. No problem with spashing, though. The sink drain must have been clogged because it was slow. Outlet on desk top lamp does not work. Parking lot costs $10 plus it can be far from the rooms numbering less than 30.

On a somewhat picky note, the staff at the front desk have been ambivalent, at best, as to new guests checking in. Not a huge deal, but if you like to be warmly greeted when you get to a new hotel, this is not the place for you. The building is old, and very oddly designed. Someone posted that the top five floors were removed at one point due to air traffic at Pearson. This actually makes sense, as the building is odd looking and to get to the top to floors requires two elevators, even though there are only five or six floors. It is also very unattractive from the outside, but clean inside. The rooms are surprisingly quiet considering that airplanes are coming directly over the building and not very far above it.

The CHEF did come over to check on us after we had received our food, and apologized for the delay in service due to the unexpected rush they had experienced.

We checked-in and found a spot in the adjoining garage. Hotel parking is $10/day, but is half price for Priority Club Platinum Elite members. A day earlier, we received a phone call asking if we could be switched from an accessible room to a king room, which was not a problem for us. Our room (430) had a large desk, sofa chair and ottoman, along with a flat screen TV, coffee machine, mini refrigerator and in-room safe. One wall had quite tropical wallpaper, and the floor was hardwood. The room was quite fine except for a small hole in the door. The bathroom was a good size with a large mirror and counter.

There are two free Internet terminals on the ground floor, but the keyboards are the worst that I have ever used. The keys need to be firmly struck and sometimes do not register. I assume that these are used as a deterent to theft, in which case they do a fine job.

Five floors and to get to the fifth, you have to get off at 4 and take a separate elevator up the rest of the way! Breakfast in their restaurant is limited, but very tasty. Parking fee for hotels at the airport is outrageous: $10 to $15 per night even for guests and Indigo's was $10. They have their own garage and are off airport property, so they are just gouging. Nothing within walking distance except a strip club, Hooter's and the Arizona Bar and Grill (food was fair to good and Veronica was sweet). Overall not a bad hotel and folks are nice (especially Amanda at the front desk). Pool seemed clean and the hardwood-looking flooring in the room was unique. I stayed 4 days/3 nights and on the second day discovered the door would not stay locked (if you gave the handle a jiggle just right, it opened). Told the desk and it was not fixed. Third day, housekeeper offered to lock with brass key while we were out and leave a key at the front desk; but, when we returned, the night desk clerk had no such key and the door was again unlocked. Glad no one took our laptops and jewelry! Guess this is why they have a safe in the room! On top of that, that same night they had cancelled our electronic key card, so we could not enter the hotel from the parking garage and had to carry all of our luggage down 3 levels of garage ramps after midnight. Wife never felt safe in a room where the door would not lock, especially considering the industrial airport location, and even spent one night with a nearby relative because of it. Explained all of this to one of the managers before we left, Patrick Guzman, who offered to comp me a breakfast and parking. I stated I wanted to give the hotel an opportunity to earn my trust and would stay an extra night, but he would only comp a night's stay if I were a Priority Gold member, and I was just Priority!! Go figure! I had a Hotwire rate of $60/night+parking and tax, so I did not push it, but did check-out and stay that extra night elsewhere and will not use them again. Anytime I have had a problem with hotels or rental cars while using Hotwire, the respective management has not been very accommodating, always indicating the Hotwire booking leaves them little with which to work. Still, Hotwire has yielded very, very good deals and been helpful in the past, so I may bring this to their attention. Indigo is a good, clean place to stay provided you have transportation to get something to eat and you make sure your room door locks properly! (P.S. the best ultra modern suite at Toronto airport, IMHO, is at the Sandman Signature Hotel, and if I recall, the parking was free and if you find a special deal, you will not regret it!

This time, I have chosen to stay at the Hotel Indigo Toronto Airport. You know the rules by now, I show up at the hotel and check what their rates are for walk-in customers and see how their service lives up to their promises online. So, without further adieu, let's get started! When I was researching this hotel before arriving, I was very worried that this hotel would be a quick rehab from the shoddy airport motel it was before to just satisfy the basic requirements of a Hotel Indigo. To be fair, I had the same worry when I travelled to the Hotel Indigo Amhurst (see other review). Upon arrival, it was a very dark exterior, not too much in the way of lights. I pulled up and parked under the verandah to head in. It was a first to walk into the lobby and hear the pounding of music coming out of the conference rooms, turns out a wedding was going on. No problem, you can't hear it anywhere else in the hotel! Heading up to reception I was greeted with some scepticism which I'm used to by now. Rate searching came up with $139.00, the posted internet rate. The agent asked what I was looking for, I said \"a simple King\", but she meant price wise. I gave her the competitive rate at the Crowne Plaza which was $119.00 (+$14.00 for parking) when she counter offered with $109.00 with Parking at $10.00. I was very excited to hear the rate, accepted and reserved the room. When she found out that I was an Ambassador (Gold Elite) I was treated like a Platinum for some reason. I was given a $5.00 discount on parking, and a $5.00 breakfast gift card for the restaurant. Very swanky! My room was located on the 5th floor. It seems that floor 5 was an addition after the fact of the original hotel building. When I was checked-in, I was told that I had to take an elevator to the 4th floor and then another elevator to the 5th. It felt very exclusive, not a burden. The only thing was that the 4-5 elevator was small, felt a little claustrophobic. No problem, you're only in there for 15 seconds anyways. The hotel looks like it was ripped down to the frame and rebuilt. That's how good it looks. The hotel is very true to the Hotel Indigo brand, new walls, carpets, decor etc. I was very impressed from the lobby to the second I got to my room. On the room floors the only thing which wasn't replaced during the refurb were the doors to each room. They are very old and are showing clear wear and tear. It would benefit the hotel to change the doors to complete the restoration. Entering my room, I was greeted by a hardwood floored room which opened up into a very large room. Again, I was very surprised and pleased by what I saw! Newly hard-wooded floors, brand new walls with special treatment, and warm lighting. The King Bed was off centred to allow for a large sitting area which included a 32\" HDTV on swivel wall mount. Unfortunately the TV remote didn't work for some reason, too bad but I was able to change the channels (slowly) using the buttons on the TV. Beside the wall-mounted TV was a large working area with a white leather ergonomic chair. Very comfortable, got lots of work done. In the washroom there was an open concept shower which was retiled and re-walled. Sink and toilet area were also newly refurbished. I really enjoyed my time at the Hotel Indigo, I can't state enough that it is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in a while!

They not only grabbed amenities for me (lost toothbrush, paste, combed, etc), but they also booked their complimentary airport shuttle for me an HOUR before their regular service because of my early flight! The rooms are great. They are newly renovated and the furnishings are tasteful and fresh. The bed was comfortable and the rooms were spacious considering I only had a queen size bed.

Super-comfortable bed. Clean hotel situated in a quiet business district 1km north of the 401 just east of the 427 with minimal road traffic. Easy access to both major highways. Gorgeous and extremely spacious bathroom with Aveda toiletries. Ideal for those wishing to avoid the hectic downtown environment while still being just 23km to downtown Toronto. Close to Pearson airport, with free shuttle service. Competitive rates. Relatively comfortable office chair and large work area. Roughly 50 channels. Quiet and efficient A/C and heating controlled on the wall. Nice pool/whirlpool/sauna/steam room area, though pool was set at 60 (!) degrees. Cons: Relatively poor soundproofing around entry doors - with a 1/2\" gap at the bottom - enable hallway conversations to enter the room with clarity, further amplified by the wooden floors. $10 daily for parking in a remote business district is bizarre. TV doesn't tilt, and is situated off the bed near the window, facing the side table lamp. While the shower is nice, the 50% open design is not practical, as I found myself wiping down a good 300ml of water outside the unit after every use. Never saw a newspaper here. Elevators are extremely slow. Overall, an enjoyable experience, but many minor things would make a difference for many. Note: Commute time when heading to Toronto is unpredictable- on dozens of trips from Mississauga, the fastest drive into the city (427 to Gardiner Expressway) one can expect is 25 minutes during off-peak hours, but it can be upwards of an hour, even longer with the closure of the Gardiner. Note that through the summer of 2010 you are best to go east on the 401, as much of the Gardiner will be closed.

Since I don't know the city well I thought I would look around the airport, where there are always lots of hotels. I ran across the Indigo and it looked nice from the outside. It turned out to be a boutique hotel, trying to be chic, with \"relaxing\" decor, bamboo floors, upscale shampoos, and haiku all around. Yes, haiku. It was also not so expensive, with a AAA rate of $85 CND, so I took it. Room was very clean and nice, \"shibui\" (Japanese for serenity or subtlety) atmosphere. OK! But I was awakened at 3 AM by the alarm clock (that I had not set myself) and it took me a while before figuring out how to turn it off. Finally I unplugged it. Then the room was way too warm and there was no way to reduce the temperature. Finally, the shower was so precious and subtle that I had absolutely no idea how to turn it on. Believe me, I have nothing against shibui--I lived in Japan for two years and pride myself in acceptance of the culture, plus I speak a reasonably fluent Japanese. But even in Japan they try to reduce annoyances such as this. Next time I will look more vigorously for a plain old Holiday Inn. Oh, one last thing. They charge $10 for overnight parking, and even though I complained to the hotel about the annoyances mentioned above, they didn't offer any adjustments, not even when I suggested that they could take off the parking fee, perhaps?

Hardwood floors, unique shower etc. I was felling pretty good about things, I went down to the Phi restaurant in the lobby. The food was pretty pricey, but I guess that is to be expected. What I didn't expect was a plate of hummus with some olives to take 25mins to prepare! Like another poster commented it seems like only 1 or 2 people work in the whole building. The bartender kept disappearing into the back ,I think he was the cook too. I took a shuttle to the airport which didn't seem to be a problem. Catching a shuttle on the way back however was. When I called the hotel to find out where it was they said it was on the way. After 45mins I called again and he said it had just returned and was headed out again. I didn't want to wait any longer so I took a taxi. It is a $18 min charge from the airport. I was pretty mad since it is a 5 min drive. The girl at the front counter was kind of useless so I didn't even bother to tell her what happened. I went up to the room, and the next problem arose. The walls are paper thin! We could hear everything. Sleep was nearly impossible! The next morning in the shower you could hear people showering in the next room, it was almost like they were in your shower with you.
