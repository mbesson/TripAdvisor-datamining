We were also just a five minute taxi ride from the Termini Stazione and a 15 minute taxi ride from the Vatican. There were also lots of little restaurants in the immediate area. The hotel room itself was tidy with its own bathroom and the service was good. Our room which was a double overlooked a side street. My sisters single room overlooked the gardens of the buildings next door and had a small balcony that proved to be very useful for evening snacks and a glass of wine. There was a full breakfast available. The reception staff were very helpful, going out of their way to help us ensure a visit to the Galleria Borghese for which we had not booked. There is the tiniest elevator, taking just two people at a time, if you're not claustrophobic it's OK, if you are just close your eyes or use the stairs if you are able. The only down factor was the smell of sewerage outside the rooms, especially on the 3rd floor. Fortunately this did not come into the rooms. The cost of 2 people for 4 nights in October 2011 cost us 600 Euros which we thought was very reasonable. There was an extra levy per day that had to be paid over and above the cost of the hotel.

There was no computer access unless you brought your own. The staff were very reluctant to assist with booking tickets online and it felt like you were bothering them if you asked for any suggestions or directions for sightseeing or eating. The room had few ammenities for a four star. Very basic furnishings and a worn out grungy feel. Not at all a place you'd like to hang out. The ugly: The room stank - literally. At first we thought they had just cleaned the carpets and it would go away but the smell never did. We had to plug our noses when we entered the room and run to open the window before we could adjust. It was literally gagging after a day of being closed up. Couldn't decide what the cause was. Even our clean clothes had to be washed when we got home as the smell had penetrated our suitcases. There was black mould all along the tub, goop splashed along the wall and everything felt grungy. The wool blanket between the sheets looked like it was never washed. The basics were cleaned everyday and you can tell the staff worked hard but the maintainance of the hotel was sadly lacking. Sort of like an old hooker. From a distance it looks great - but up close it tells a different story. If you are looking for a place to stay at a decent price it does the trick.

It\u2019s also a relatively short walk from the nearest stop of the Ciao open top bus tour route, which we found to be a very good way to get around the key attractions including Colosseum and Vatican in a day. Hotel reception has leaflets for this and similar tours. Reception staff were friendly and helpful, giving useful advice. Dining room offers a basic but adequate buffet breakfast but no other meals. Rooms were clean and comfortable with hairdryer, soaps, shampoos etc. in the bathrooms. One of our rooms had a balcony but from the outside, I don\u2019t think there are many so guess we were lucky. However, it wasn\u2019t the type of holiday where we made great use of it anyway. There are seven floors and the two lifts can only really accommodate two people each. Being on the second floor, it was easier just to go up the stairs. As my job includes teaching Fire Marshal courses, I wasn\u2019t too happy about the way they sometimes have laundry baskets in what is their fire exit staircase. We could get past them OK in normal use but with 100 people staying, they should make better effort to keep them clear in case of emergency. If you like pizza, there is a restaurant called Pepe Nero two streets away and the hotel recommended it to us.

Well let me reassure you that I am neither of the above. I will however present my very first negative hotel review. I feel the need to write this because of my obligation to humanity. I decided to surprise my wife with a trip to Rome. The travel agent assured me the hotel would be a 4 star rating. To be fair to the agent, he had never been there. Let me start of by saying that my stay at the Hotel Executive in Rome, was my WORST experience EVER. They rate it as four stars, I would be generous (or even lying) if I gave it 2. The room smelt of wet socks. The bed was a King size, which was a bonus because we had to share it with bugs the size of full grown adults. I got bitten four times after which I decided to sleep in my jeans. Ever tried sleeping in jeans on a romantic weekend?? They said there was a balcony with a view. Ever tried staying in a room where the only view you had was of a lift generator, water tank and two half dead pigeons. The lifts took forever to travel the 7 floors to our room. I managed to get a little routine going, I would call the lift BEFORE I went into the make-shift shower, that way it would arrive just after I got dressed 10 minutes later!! The 14inch TV (which was about 10 years old) was placed on a stool. The settee had stains on it which I don't really want to go into right now, or ever!! The carpet was alive, yes alive. Must be the dwelling place for the bugs that couldn't fit on the bed. The bathroom was so scary. It was a traumatic ordeal contemplating using it. We didn't drink or eat much so that we could limit the time we needed to visit the loo. Let me conclude by saying this PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not stay at the Hotel Executive in Rome.

Anyway, I stayed at the 4th floor and there was a bad smell in the whole place. In my tiny room there was a wall really close to the bed with mildew, in fact everything in the room was falling apart. Outside the elevator there was a (strange) heavy second door with no stopping mechanism so everytime someone was getting in or out of the elevator you can hear in your room the noise that was made. The breakfast was poor and bad. No pc in the hotel. Not really close to the centre (you have to take a taxi several times) and of course ridiculously expensive (it's a 4 star after all).

The neighbour area is a construction site, but noone worked there as long as we stayed. We stayed for 4 days, and the only thing we weren't to happy about, was the very limited breakfast table. There were two somewhat hard types of pastry, eggs, and cheese and ham. Exept that, some types of jam in small portion boxes, and some sereals. After four breakfasts we were kind of tired of egg, ham and cheese..the coffee was fantastic though=) The hotel staff was very serviceminded and helpful, and most of them spoke OK english, by italian standards. For computer nerds, there is a free WiFi zone in the lobby, but for some reason they change the crappy 200 digit WEP hexcode every day(so yesterdays guests can't come back and steal netaccess=) When you want to travel around in the city from the hotel, the easiest way is to buy a metropass (bus, metro, city trains) for three or seven days on one of the metros or Termini. There are many buses to Piazza Fiume (right beside the hotel), or from via Salaria, the street to the right from hotel exit. The yellow bus-signs tells you where the busses stops, so don't go buing an expensive map. You'll get a free tourist map in the lobby, thats all you need. The conclusion is that Hotel Executive has the standards you need if you're going to Rome to see the city. If you're going to have a hotel vacation and stay in your room(why go to Rome then?), watch TV and slumber in a steambath we would recommend other.

For that kind of money I enjoyed my experience there. The hotel is situated in between Castro Pretorio and Spagna metro stops and it is aprox. 15 min. walk to either station. I didn't mind that. It is a 5 min. walk to villa Borghese and the gallery, so you can just drop in and book your time slot there, especially valuable if you're planning on using your roma pass as you can't pre-book on-line without paying. There are a few shops and local restaraunts around the area that are excellent and charge you \"local\" prices! Now about the hotel itself: the rooms are extremely small, probably the smallest double room I've seen, however, extremely clean. The bathroom was quite large and very clean also. Extremely efficient air-conditioning with various settings that also work! - very important in August! The breakfast is quite good and the staff are very friendly and willing to help! Overall, it is a decent hotel, I'm not quite sure if it rises up to a 4 star criteria, but at least, it is a high 3 star one.

If you are not very mobile or hate walking then you will struggle, although there is an express local bus which runs into town from near the hotel. Although a way from the centre, this means there are some nice local restaurants around where you can eat real Italian food for great prices without a picture menu in sight. A word of warning - taxis from the Termini train station and where the airport buses stop charge thirty Euros as a flat fee, so you will be paying 45 Euros (about \u00a334) for a five minute ride. If they can rip you off, they will. If you haven't much luggage the hotel is a fifteen minute walk away (bring a map or buy one at station for one euro) or there are loads of buses that travel the mile or so to the hotel.

The gardens nearby are worth a visit.Warning-Beware the taxi from the airport we hardly got out the door of the airport when this charmer with very little english had us in the taxi, i did ask how much but he was driving us on before saying i use meter. we were overcharged, 75euro. The hotel booked the return taxi cost 48 euro so beware! But we had a great time and enjoyed the open top bus,a excellent way of seeing Rome.", "Date": "March 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cno problems!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4148583", "Content": "This hotel was essentially fine. The room was a good size and reception was friendly. Location wise it took us so long to find - no one had heard of it! But when we actually saw where it was we had been walking in circles only 2 mins from it so my advice it to take a map before you go!! Breakfast in the morning was substantial. Like the hotel really; it was good, but nothing spectacular. Hotel Executive is in a nice area, theres a very sweet bar nearby called \"friends\" which I recommend, also a few minutes walk away are some small little restaurants, pizzerias etc which all seemed to have a lot of lovely character. We had a really great time in Rome and recommend hotel Executive as a good base from which to see everything.", "Date": "November 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, UK", "Title": "\u201cNot a 4-star!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4142027", "Content": "We've just got back from Rome where we spent 4 nights at this hotel. Both my husband and I did not like the hotel. First of all, our room was very small and horribly smelly. We couldn't quite work out where the smell was coming from, but it must have been either the carpet (if someone incontinent stayed there before!) or the air conditioning unit. We sprayed the room and used fragnant candles, but still could not get rid of the smell. I agree with the earlier review saying that this hotel (rooms in particular)has no ambience. It should have been given a 3 star rating!", "Date": "November 24, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Executive", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d232891-Reviews-Hotel_Executive-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$92 - $200*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Aniene 3</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Piazza Fiume</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00198</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "232891", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/33/ab/33ab5dcbaab623a87fceec0a949967e32large.jpg"}}
