I'm a former Marriott employee, Marriott credit union member, Marriott rewards member, Marriott vacation club owner and a very frequent business traveler. To say that I have high expectations of Marriott (the brand) is an understatement. This means I expect the same general look, feel and servcie, across all brands. I realize that the different products speak to a different demographic, but when you pay 100,000 points for a San Diego Residence Inn that has the look, feel and smell of a cheap motel, something has gone really really wrong. This location, the one we moved from, off PCH was awful and my 9 year old said it smelled like rotten eggs. It did. One look at the tiny space (called a 1 bedroom suite) told me we were being \"punk'd\". I immediately called Marriott reservations and reached out to the \"residence inn's\" management for an immediate change. Gratefully, there were other Marriott properties available in the area, but unfortunately, none were at the same points or room type. When neither, Marriott reservations or the Residence in on PCH could help, I called the Residence Inn in the Gas Lamp Quarter and spoke with the most helpful, empathetic and professional Marriott employee, I've ever had the pleasure of begging for help. Kelly Montes (guest services rep) took me seriously and got right down to helping me solve my problem. Not only did she make things happen quickly, she went above and beyond by working with Marriott Reservations and the other Residence Inn, in order to get my points (all 100,000) transferred to the their location, for the same room type (the REAL thing). This Easter Sunday was looking to be a long and disappointing day, but Kelly made everything work for me and my family and we are truly appreciative and grateful for her efforts to make something so wrong...right.

The hotel was mostly quiet and restaurants weren't packed. I think this probably made a (positive) difference. Check-in was very quick as was check-out. Staff was friendly. The hotel, as others have mentioned, is quite new. The hotel was well situated to shopping, good dining and the obvious, convention center and ballpark. There is a CVS 2 blocks down which was nice for things I forgot to pack and didn't want to check if the hotel had any. My room was very nice. Clean, well laid-out. I only made use of the kitchenette for the refrigerator. It is a full sized refrigerator. The dishes, pans, utensils, etc. were ample. The bathroom was impeccably clean noting that the the sink is outside of the sliding bathroom \"door\". I had 2 (non-opening) windows in my room. The bed was reasonably comfortable. My colleague's room was slightly different in layout but not by much. His room was also impeccably clean and tidy. Internet wasn't charged which is nice since the Marriott across the street and, well, basically all other nearby hotels charge for it. I saw other guests at the computer terminals in the lobby though I didn't personally take part. The breakfast was fairly standard. My colleague and I ate there once but decided to try local restaurants for the other breakfasts. We didn't partake of the happy hour. I noticed that in the room, you can make a grocery list and they will shop for you (plus a convenience fee) which I thought was kind of neat. The valets were very quick. They always opened the doors for the passengers. The car was always quick to arrive. They even began to know our faces so they didn't need to ask for the tag. $35/day for parking is a little ridiculous even though it is the regular price anywhere nearby. I can't really blame them for keeping up with the Jones's. There is not a self-parking option. I used the coin laundry not the send-away laundry option. It was convenient. There were probably 6 washers and 6 driers. The change machine didn't work but the front desk was able to give me change. My only complaint with the laundry was that I had NO idea how long the drier was going to take. Some of the machines had timers on them but many did not. I certainly wasn't going to wait around until it finished but I really didn't know when to come back. Since no one else was using the machines at the time, it wasn't a big deal that my laundry hijacked a machine after finishing and before I returned. The workout room was clean and stocked. There were towels, antibacterial wipes, lotion and water. There were TVs on the (2) treadmills and (2) ellipticals in addition to one on the wall for people who were weightlifting. It is a small hallway with windows on either side. I served its purpose and was more than I have had at other similar hotels. The only complaints I had were minor. First, as others have noted, the walls are paper-thin. Inside walls and outside walls. So, in addition to the sirens outside (not often), I could easily hear my neighbor up puking all night. Fortunately, (s)he only occupied the room that 1 night. Because the hotel wasn't fully occupied, the sounds of doors opening/closing wasn't a big deal. If it had been full, I would probably have been driven crazy by the noise. The second complaint was that the hotel staff didn't know much about some of the restaurants nearby. When I asked for recommendations, neither the staff at the front desk nor the 2 valets could give me a recommendation. I was asking about 3 different restaurants and none of them had been to any of those 3. It is very helpful as an out of town guest for the hotel staff to have at least visited the restaurants within walking distance (3 blocks even) so they can make personal recommendations. Again this is a very minor point. The third complaint I had was that you had to use your room key to get anywhere in the hotel. You had to insert it to take the elevator up/down. You had to use it to get into the pool area and again to get into the workout room. It became a hassle, especially when my room key wasn't keyed well, so it sometimes took 5 tries for it to register. I finally took the key to the desk and got a replacement. The only other minor thing to note is that there is a small place for smokers. It is immediately when you leave the 3rd floor headed out to the swimming pool. So, you have to walk past the billows of smoke to go to the pool or workout room. Overall, it was a very pleasant stay. I typically only stay at Hiltons or Hilton chains (Embassy Suites or other). This was my first stay at a Residence Inn and I was delighted. I will consider these in the future.

The hotel is in the Gaslamp District with tons of restaurants and bars within a few blocks. The lobby was very nicely done and modern. Everybody we dealt with in the hotel was helpful and courteous. We went to the lobby bar both nights and the staff there was great. The hotel has a a free breakfast in the morning that not only has the usual high carb/high sugar cold items, but some hot items like eggs and potatoes. They also had fruit and yogurt. It was a pretty nice spread. The days we stayed there were some large families with kids who did a pretty good job of eating just about everything in sight and would leave everything a mess. The staff did a wonderful job of keeping everything stocked and clean. The only things I think I could complain about were how expensive it was to valet park and have our dog stay with us. The parking issue isn't totally their fault. It is a city and parking is always a premium, but $20 day is pretty steep. I went to see how much it was in the garage next door and pricing seems to vary on what day and what time you come in, etc. so I didn't bother. It's great that they are dog friendly and we even got to have our dog sit with us in the lobby bar area near the fireplace. $100 is pretty steep for a non-shedding, well behaved, seven pound dog and I'm sure it's pure profit for them. You can't tell me they had to clean any more than usual. When I complained they reduced it a little, but still it's a bit much. I really like this place and I'll gladly stay there again next time I'm in town.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cSuperb location, helpful staff, surprisingly nice rooms\u201d", "Author": "Travelin_JC", "ReviewID": "UR123107421", "Content": "I stayed one night for business.

My sister and I were visiting San Diego in November. We choose the hotel for it's great location and closeness to the convention center, which was only a 4 block walk away. From the beginning the staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful. The bell boys, front desk staff, maid service and morning breakfast staff all made our stay at the hotel amazing. The area in itself was also great. The Gas Lamp is a busy area with numerous restaurants for eating and stores to shop in. In the evening many of the homeless come out, which makes the area seem a little seedy, but I've heard this is the case all over California. We arrived at the hotel early for check in, but the staff was happy to give us a room. We had booked a King bed, but our room had a Queen. When we mentioned this to the staff they were more than happy to change us to a room with a bigger bed. The rooms themselves were beautiful. From the decor to the kitchen, which had every tool and device I could ask for, the room was contemporary and comfortable. Being from NY I can tell you that the entire room would be the envy of any resident used to small apartment living. One of the other reasons we chose the hotel was for the morning breakfast that was included. I had to arrive early at the convention so I didn't want the hassle of trying to find someplace to eat. I was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of the food that was offered. They had different types of hot/cold cereal, breads, hot eggs, sausage and a waffle maker so you can custom make your own waffles. Of course, coffee/tea and various juices. All presented in a very clean and pleasant atmosphere, albeit a little small for the number of people that were staying at the hotel. At the end of our stay, checkout was a breeze. I had an early morning flight to catch and had to leave before breakfast. When I inquired about where I could get breakfast before leaving they told me not to worry. The breakfast attendant was there and he made me up a box of food to take with me on my trip home. It was so very nice of them.

CONS: Get to breakfast early because we noticed the one day we were late, it was hectic. The other thing I noticed is that the hotel does not have a check in system in place and I was sure people who were not staying at hotel were eating for free. One day we went across the street because it was so crowded. The other thing you should worry about is the noise. Since this is party central, you will hear lots of noise at night in area. Lots of young people stay here ready to party so be prepared for lots of young 20 somethings in the hotel. The final complaint $35 valet!!!

He said, \"We're very limited. We're sold out\", which left me thinking \"what exactly are you saving them for\"? We're Marriott Rewards members, and my husband travels for business, spending between a month and three months each year at Marriotts. I asked again, \"you don't have anything in a King?\" to which he replied, \"oh, I do have one available.\" The room was fine, other than some outdoor noise and the fact that the cable kept going out and the volume didn't work on the bedroom TV. When we checked out the receipt had 2 valet charges on it, although we used the garage next door. We brought it to the attention of the heavyset man at the front desk, who picked up the phone and said \"I need you to verify that a customer didn't use the valet.\" He might as well have said \"I need you to verify that this customer isn't lying\", because that's what we heard. Another woman comes to the desk, and starts flipping through a book with names and room numbers - apparently a valet book. She spends approximately 3 minutes flipping pages before my husband says \"you're not going to find our name because it's not in there\", and she replies, \"it could be under a different name\". She continued to read the same pages over and over, convinced that we were liars. Wow. They eventually conceded that we were, in fact, not liars, and credited the charges. By that point, however, they had lost our business forever, and cost us over 10 minutes while they investigated THEIR mistake. The girl who eventually checked us out was named Mona, but the heavyset man wasn't wearing a nametag, nor was the tall, thin girl who is likely still looking for proof that we used the valet. The man never spoke again after making the initial phone call, and pointed anyone who walked up to him over to Mona for assistance, making them wait in line while he served no one. Both Mona and the other girl finally asked \"How was your stay, other than this?\" after I walked silently to the other end of the counter and picked up business cards for both the Guest Service Manager and TripAdvisor reviews. If they find this type of investigation necessary when encountering this type of error, they need to do it in the back room rather than at the counter.

The bathroom vanity is actually in the room itself, which is just odd. I wouldn't stay in the room with anyone other than a spouse, because it's a little close. The location is really wonderful. However, looking around there are two very nice hotels within the same block. I certainly would consider investigating them if I were to return. The workout room was undersized.

We stayed over Valentine's Day weekend. My husband made arrangements with this hotel to have flowers delivered to our room for me. They weren't there when we arrived, but he thought maybe the flowers would be brought later after we got back from dinner. No flowers ever showed up. So when we checked out the next day my husband checked at the front desk about the flowers and apparently they had been in a side office since the day before. Nobody knew why they weren't taken up to us. The flowers had our name on them. Also, we had called down to the front desk to have someone come up and assist us with our luggage, we also contacted valet to have our car brought to the front so that we could leave. Our car made it. Nobody ever showed up to get our luggage after we waited 30 minutes. So we decided to bring our luggage down ourselves. When when got down to our car we told the valet we were sorry our car had to sit so long, we told him we had been waiting for a half hour for help.

It would of been as easy as to say \"service not available at this time\", but he did it with no expectation of any sorts. I hope he becomes EMPLOYEE OF THE YEAR for Marriott as a whole.

All i can say is, do NOT believe what you see in the photos on the website! We were in utter and total shock when we walked into our room and saw the size of it. The \"full kitchen\" is literally 5 feet long with a dishwasher, fridge, microwave, and 2-burner electric cooktop all wedged into a tiny corner of the room. Well I immediately called the front desk to confirm that this was the room seen on the webstite that i had booked. What i was told was, Every room is the exact same sq footage but some are laid out different than others. The room was very clean and well kept, and the staff was very friendly but we simply couldnt get over the size of the room. It looks NOTHING like the pictures online. Here were some of the more strange and confusing things about the room and the hotel in general: THE BAD 1) There was no sink in the bathroom!?!? The sink and counter is setup outside the bathroom right next to the bed. Great, the last thing i wanna see is other people washing up, brushing their teeth and shaving. 2) No vent in the bathroom!?!? First time ever i have seen a hotel bathroom with no vent system whatsoever. 3) The hotel pool maxed out a 3.5' deep!?!? For a hotel this size how do you not have a pool where the water level comes above adults waists?? 4) The hotel resteraunt and bar. OK im used to paying huge overblown prices for small portions, i mean it is a hotel resteraunt, but when my buddy spent $15 for 4 buffalo wings and 10 french fries, i was kind of shocked. Also the resteraunt/bar area is like the room, tiny! On the website they make the resteraunt look huge and the bar look like a seperate area for drinking, its not and its not. 5) The elevators. I dont know if this is a new trend in hotels but you have to swipe your room card in the elevator panel everytime you want to use it....EVERY TIME. Gets very old when your going in and out a lot. THE GOOD 1) Hotel and room were sparkling clean and updated with new carpet, fixtures and very stylish decor. 2) Staff was very friendly and helpfull. 3) There was a free breakfast every morning, but i didnt have a chance to get at it, but the area they served it in looked very cozy.

Despite my request for a higher floor, we ended up on the third floor, and since the hotel was booked full, we had to stick with the room for the first night. Room(s) are not massive, but space enough for two people to survive a week. The building has some nice features to remind visitors of its history - including exposed brick at reception, and sliding \"barn-style\" frosted glass doors in rooms. Ultra cool. The only issue is that such a door doesn't allow for much privacy when it's between the bedroom and the bathroom. Our first room was a king with a full bathroom (including small tub/shower) and pull out sofa, as well as kitchen. When we finally got moved to a higher floor on our second night (I had to pull some attitude with front desk, who maintained that the hotel was still \"very full\"...though in the end, it turned out there were several other rooms available) we were downgraded to a queen bed -- still with pull-out sofa, full kitchen. Our bathroom had a glass and tile shower, though, and no tub. This was fine -- the shower was spacious. Noise from hallways was an issue -- the elevators chime very loudly, and voices of other guests seem to travel right in to the room. When tucked away into the bedroom with the sliding door shut, it wasn't an issue. The kitchen is fully stocked. I was a bit wary of the housekeeping staff replacing used glasses in cupboards, as we knew they weren't going through the dishwasher in our suite. (Hopefully the new glassware came off a cart, and wasn't just wiped and replaced!) Overall, the suite was well-cleaned each day, though the couches in both rooms we had were already fairly grimy. Our shower door leaked a lot of water, but since housekeeping was so good at replacing towels, we just mopped up as we went. Our only issue was not being able to open a window -- long term stays in hotels can make one claustrophobic. An opening window would have been nice...but obviously that's just not possible the way things were built. The free breakfast is a bit of a zoo -- this is a family hotel, and as such, the eating area is over-run with families of all sizes. Still, the food is varied and healthy options are available. Staff work really hard to clear tables and meet the demands of even the rudest guests -- and should be commended for keeping a smile on their faces! Pool itself is small, but the roof top terrace it's on offers a relaxing space to lounge in the hot SoCal sun. Didn't use the fitness room, but loved its location looking down on busy 5th Avenue. Laundry facilities were a most welcome thing as I was travelling over 12 days in total. Free internet was a great perk. Lobby was large, with seating for several groups, a business centre of sorts, and a bar/resto around the corner. The mini-shop in the lobby was handy though priced high. Parking may be priced a bit steep, but the valet guys were amazing at fetching cars and hailing cabs. Overall, this hotel is a relatively cool and fairly reasonable option for staying in the Gaslamp District. Far enough away from train tracks as to avoid those midnight blaring cargo trains, but still in thr heart of the busy and noisy bar/restaurant zone of the Gaslamp. Ask for a higher floor to help with the weekend noise, if you're sensitive to that.

Ah yes, April 14th, a full month prior to arrival when I made our reservation and paid for the entire 3 night stay UP FRONT via the ADVANCE PURCHASE RATE directly through Marriott's site onto my credit card. Stated very clearly on the reservation is \"LATE CHECK-IN\" as my husband and I, along with our 3 y/o would be driving from Disneyland. Guess what happened? Yup, finally made it to the hotel and was told that our room was \"sold away\". Huh? How can this be? It is already paid for, thus already mine. At 9:46pm (as per my cell phone statement) I called the desk to remind them that we would be late and are coming form Disney. I was told that my room was waiting for us and that my request for a sofa bed for my toddler would be honored. At 10:45pm I called again to report that we were lost, but that we were still coming. This time the same clerk stated that there were only 8 rooms left and to hurry. I reminded her that I had a reservation, and she just reiterated to \"hurry\". At 12 o'clock at night, our super-tired family was ushered across the street to another Marriott, told that the room would be compt'd (I'd certainly hope so) and to pack up all our stuff and return the following morning. Again, whaaaaat?!?! So we go across the street like the Griswalds amid a bustling lobby filled with clubbers and ask for our room key. The room was fine, but lacked the kitchenette we reserved with the Residence Inn for all the food supplies we had stopped to buy on the way. Had to toss all perisables. And this other hotel didn't offer the free breakfast like the Residence Inn, either. The next morning, called the desk at Residence Inn. The manager on-duty was very nice and knew who we were and said to come anytime as our room was ready. Got over about 11am and being from EST, were starving for breakfast and mentioned how we missed out. Promptly given a $25 credit and a 10% coupon for the Broken Yolk restaurant across the way. That was the only discount given for the hassle from the night before. And the 10% coupon is given to any guest that asks. Only got the $25 credit because I complained. And the super-nice corner room they supposidely upgraded us to? Well, my brother and his gf happened to be staying there with us, and they got a corner room. So much for the upgrade. They got there from Disney just before us. NICE. Had to stay in a different hotel from my family. I mentioned how I was not satified and asked if the $32 a night valet fee could be taken care of. \"No\" was the answer. Nothing more was done to try to make us happy, so here is your warning. Later, I went to the desk looking for the clerk that said my room was still available the night before. Kelly appears and seems nervous. When asked how on Earth she could give our room away even after talking to her twice prior to arriving, she first blamed the guy that replaced her shift for the night, then said that on busy evenings it becomes \"first come, first serve\". Again, WHAAAAAATTTTT?!?! Then why bother making a reservation? She had no answer. I left the desk uphappy once again. Upon check-out, I had given up on trying to get some satisfaction, a discount, somethng other that $25 for a breakfast we missed out on, not to mention the food we had to throw away. The lady at the desk was different, given in was now Monday and asked the usual, \"How was your stay\" question. Mistake. BIG MISTAKE. Quickly went though the events that had happened upon arrival, and went so far as to mention how we were still not happy. Strike Three....nothing more was done and the general manager's business card was requested. Right after this review is posted, the letter to the GM is getting written. UNBELIEVABLE.

Sleep-deprived best describes our excruciating un-restful experience. Management is unsympathetic and apathetic to our request to cancel, penalty free, a pre-paid reservation for next September. BENEATH EXPECTATIONS: Room, in general, is clean; we found a hair beret on the floor next to the sink. Bathroom is extremely small; toilet and shower (no tub) are co-located; with the sink vanity located in the sleeping area. Shower stall is scarcely sufficient to move around in. Roof top pool is small and the chairs and tables are limited even though the space will accommodate twice as many chairs and tables. No in-room safe; only safe deposit boxes at the front desk, which we did not use. Hotel only offers valet parking, which is an expensive $32 per night.

Location is walking distances to many downtown activities and by private or public transportation only minutes away from numerous other attractions and landmarks. Check-in is a quick and effortless experience. Employees provide standard Marriott service; Kelly is sociable and exceptionally courteous.

However, noticeably missing from the choices are the Travel and Discover channels. Make sure to bring your portable DVD player or laptop; on the side of the television composite plug-ins are available. Sofa and overstuffed chair are comfortable for relaxing, reading, or watching television. Additional furnishings include small kitchen table, and coffee table; no desk. Medium closet contains three drawers, extra blanket and sheet and small ironing board with standard size iron. Individual climate control is simple to operate. Standard amenities, coffee and tea maker, alarm clock, and hair dryer are available. Breakfast is continental; muffins, bagels, fruit juices, fresh fruit, egg sandwiches \u2013 with ham or bacon \u2013 cereal, yogurt, milk, coffee, and waffles are made hot and fresh by the guest.

The hotel just opened recently and everything was brand new. The rooms are terrific (the best room was a corner one with huge windows and a view of the harbor - one of my co-workers had it and it was awesome). They could increase the wattage of the light bulbs over the sink, but other than that - thumbs up!", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201cawesome stay\u201d", "Author": "mountainmanAlberta", "ReviewID": "UR61209298", "Content": "stayed their for 7 days for conference. great location to everything (covention center, gaslamp restuarants/bars, grocery store). i could not believe how friendly,polite,professinal everyone at the hotel is (from the doorman,frontdesk,restuarant staff, and even housekeeping). the best part was the daily HOT breakfast they served, not this continental garbage at other hotels. the room was large with modern kitchenette. came in handy to keep my drinks in the fridge and the leftover dinner from last night just use the microwave oven. i really like the modern decor. you can tell it's very new. the only downfall was the pool (quite small and on the 3rd floor-not much sunshine as you would like and very quiet) and the gym was very small as well. the hotel across the street had a pool on the top floor. now that's the way to do it, with a bar. the other concern was the valet parking, at $32 night, very steep. however, i'm sure other hotels were like that as well. if you rent a car, the best parking is in a car park, much cheaper. overall, awesome stay. had no problems with the hotel. hey, they even have free computer use if you needed to email someone but have no laptop. recommended for anyone to come here. best part was the breakfast, unless your just coffee person in the morning.", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Surprised\u201d", "Author": "Gallerygirl_Aug08", "ReviewID": "UR60118101", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay here.

Parking is expensive at $32 a day valet only so maybe best if your only doing business in downtown to catch a taxi to the hotel. The biggest issue I had with my room was the lighting for the sink. It's only on one side. For my room that was the right side. That made it hard to shave in the morning because of the lack of lighting.
