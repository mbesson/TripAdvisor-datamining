{"Reviews": [{"Content": "I loved this place Anyone planning a trip to Berlin would do well to find a more convenient or welcoming place to stay. We booked the apartment through the internet and made our arrangements via email. Leonard (one of the two owners of the apartments) met us at exactly the time he stated with a warm smile and a bottle a champagne! The apartment was spacious, clean and had everything we needed. It's in the most amazing location and is only a short walk from all of the main attractions in the centre of Berlin. Berlin is a cool and laid back city and this apartment matched the feel of the holiday we wanted perfectly. I would definitely go back!", "Date": "Jul 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR934137265", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MsS75"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d633055-r8219911-Winterfeldt_Berlin_Apartments-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "633055", "Price": "$81"}}
