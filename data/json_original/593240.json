The location is perfect- 2 minutes foot walk from Termini station (so is the nearest metro and bus station) and at about 10-15min.walk to the antic heart of the city. The room has nice furniture and is definetly clean and well serviced. Bathroom isn't vary spacious , but is clean too and everything was working properly( includind the hairdrier) There is a free Wi-Fi , which is not mentioned in the official site of Eternaroma. In the morning you can enjoy a nice self-serviced breakfast in very calm and home-like atmosphere. Francesca is very hospitable and will wellcome you with smile , explaining you everything you need to feel like home. We will recomend Eternaroma to our friends. It is a perfect base to see and enjoy Roma, which you'll find eternal ia every part and detail.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantistico\u201d", "Author": "Henley2402", "ReviewID": "UR106714708", "Content": "Ideal hotel to explore rome especially if arriving or departing by train. Room was spacious for family of 3.Francesca was an excellent host who met us for an early check in. She even made a phone call to confirm a registration for a tour in florence. A great hotel if you arrive in Rome before noon and need somewhere to relax straight away. Comfortable beds and great bathroom. We walked to main attractions once we got our bearings. Breakfast was self serve and had a lot of choice and great coffee. Lots of restaurants around that were very good value and choice. The only improvement would be internet access but there were lots of Internet caves around.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Eterna Roma", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d593240-Reviews-Eterna_Roma-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$92 - $171*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Piazza Manfredo Fanti 22</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "593240", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/90/f5/90f5238a7a8c32aab1e3050f469c1ae51large.jpg"}}
