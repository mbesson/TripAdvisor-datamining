All of the staff there are very helpful, the people on the door are very helpful too, and reception very good. When we arrived we received a nice surprise in the room which was some strawberries and raspberries and some dipping chocolate, very nice :) Rooms are very modern, big bed, large wardrobe area and bathroom. The location is fantastic, 5mins from the incredible Berlin Zoo, its so easy to get about, and there are some great shops nearby. Lots of places to eat, Hard Rock Cafe is about 2mins away, and there are all the regular city hangouts like Starbucks etc very close by. We walked for about 30mins and visited some excellent sites, Berlin Wall, Holocaust Memorial, Brandenberg Gate, and the amazing Sony Centre which is an incredible piece of architecture.

I must say that breakfast is really 5*, colorful and rich. Hotel also has spa area (gym + sauna). As I saw, gym is brand new, basic equipment but enough for regular training. Sauna is also nice, not so specious, but clean (you have sauna and steam bath). Only minus is that hotel doesn\u2019t have pool.

Others were complaining about it at the same time; nothing happened. 2: There are no stairs. Everyone has to use the lifts, which are inadequate and slow. 3: The breakfast buffet is simply an insult. Euros 28, for a breakfast that might be fair value at Euros 8. No ''light breakfast'' option. 4: Food: strictly institutional. Prettily prepared, but very standard and, mostly, over-cooked. 5: Service. A disaster area. We had arranged shipping of our conference stand with one concierge, and completed the documentation. When we came to leave, a different concierge demanded a new and completely different set of documents, and wanted to have our Passports. We had to leave, lugging 40 kilos of stand elements with us, rather than put up with the bureaucracy. Exactly the opposite of what a concierge is MEANT to do.

We asked for another room and were given one towards the street. Despite facing the street the room was very quiet. The beds were very nice and we both slept well. The bathroom was spacious with both shower and tub - as well as speakers connected to the television, so I could follow the Porsche Cup while in the tub :) There's also free internet by cable in the room. The cleaning was spotless. In short; this is a wonderful hotel, with an almost perfect location for shopping and sightseeing. Concerning location, the only slightly annoying thing is that you can't go by U-bahn to Brandenburger Tor or Under Dem Linden without changing several times, but this has got nothing to do with the hotel. We chose to have breakfast at the hotel. The selection of diary, pastries, fruits and warm dishes is very good indeed. The scrambled eggs were disappointing, but we're quite picky when it comes to scrambled eggs. The selection of beverages is also great, even champagne is included - though not M\u00f6et, Mumm or Dom. But at 28 euros per person it's quite expensive. There's also an restaurant for the executive rooms called the Etoile but we didn't go there. If you choose to park at the hotel add another 18 euros per day. But when all things are added up we'll definitely stay here again, when we return to Berlin.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cDidn't Love It.

Walk across the street to Caras coffee house and a superb americano and muffin and carton of fresh fruit is about 8 Euros) The only down side was that the bar beside the reception has little appeal. I believe if you pay extra you can get a card that enables you to go to a roof top bar with various treats on offer. The cost for myself and friend for this plus breakfasts would have been 180 Euros, but we wanted to see Berlin and not just the inside of the hotel so we declined. The Vapiano bar/cafe is next door to the hotel and has a really good atmosphere every evening. Pizzas excellent! You get a card on entry, choose your food at various counters and pay on leaving.

It's a very nice and good looking hotel indeed. Front door guys are cool, polite and very helpful. The same goes for the reception staff and for everybody at this hotel.

I do not want to speak in general, but we had some encounters with unfriendly staff that should definitely not occur in \"5-star\" hotel like this: There was a long queue at the reception at check-out and all clerks were very busy. Suddenly a manager appeared additionally behind the desk (we assume he was some sort of supervisor, because he was not wearing a uniform and was older in age then the rest of the staff). It appeared to us he was disturbed in his office during some more relaxing work and came very grumpy to one of the computers at the reception and somehow shouted to the queueing people in the lobby they should come over to his place. No smile, no friendly word, no interest in how our stay was. We didn`t understand his mumbling that should have been a question and repeated it much louder and put a nerved face on as if he was talking to some sort of prison inhabitant. The credit card didn`t go through immediately and he rolled his eyes like we were stealing his precious time. After our check-out was done, we had to wait some time till our luggage was brought down and we kept on watching him. He was simply rude to everyone! We were not the exception. We wondered why such a obviously snotnosed, unmotivated and naughty person is allowed to work in the hospitality business. And (if he is really is a manager) which example is he to his co-workers? How much can a person like this ruin the reputation of a hotel? That is scandalous - we think.

She did not offer to add my name to the reservation. We had to specifically request that. When I tried to login to use the internet, I was prompted to use 'last name' and 'room number'. When I wrote my name it did not work. It did work with my colleague's last name.

I told her I knew my colleague's name, that this was not a 'spelling' problem, to what she reminded me that I was not the 'registered' guest. My colleague told her that I was pretty upset and felt very unwelcome at the hotel. There were two people in the room, but only one was acknowledged.

However, my non-club-level experience would not warrant the same uber-outstanding review as others found here on TA. I am not an amenities freak but the \u20ac160 room cost did not include breakfast and I felt the Concorde missed opportunities to deliver better value and a more satisfying experience. The hotel is top-tier enough and the basics so well done that it prompted me to anticipate \u201cnice touches\u201d that never materialized. Importantly, the Concorde\u2019s rooms have complimentary internet, but otherwise, there were really no useful \u201cextras.\u201d Even music through the TV had a cost. A coffee station or an iPod dock, for example, would have been a nice touch. My traveling companions at the Swissotel across the street were, for the same room cost, enjoying complimentary breakfast and checking their email on free WiFi while I was scrounging around out in the cold looking for an affordable cup of coffee. The Concorde essentially offered a nice room, good bed, and clean bathroom without the thoughtfulness or value punch that would make it a standout and distinguish it above other Berlin hotel options in their price range. The Details: Front-desk service was efficient and courteous, but a little stiff. My guest room smelled good, like fresh air. It was large, comfortably decored, and nicely broken up by a free-standing wall that housed the closet, drawers, and mini-bar and served as a divider between the guest room and the bathroom. The room was equipped with common amenities, such as a mini-bar and safe plus robes, slippers, and some toiletries. No ironing board. Mini-bar prices were high but not insulting. The bed was hard but comfortable. There was no hallway noise. Room heat was manageable by opening a window. The bathroom was quite large, with separate shower, tub, and toilet room. The green marble counters and floor tile were in perfect shape but reminded me of a 1993 Marriott. My room had no view except the tip of the Kaiser Wilhelm cathedral. Housekeeping left a sign on the bed confirming they had honored my request to not change the bed linens. (Apparently, my failure to specifically request a linen change means I specifically requested no change. Odd.) I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it as a sensible hotel option in Berlin. I doubt it will knock your socks off unless you are on the Club Level.

Get me right, it is a very good hotel indeed, but there were a few flaws. Positive things first: - The location is superb if you are considering your Berlin stay to be West Berlin only. Most of the most famous sights in Berlin are though at the border between West and East or in the East, but it is quite accessible using Berlin's excellent U-bahn metro. The shopping district along the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm is just around the corner - and the lovely Berlin Zoo is less than 10 minutes walk away. - The breakfast at the hotel is a great experience. In a breakfast room that looks to be designed 1962-63 (but new of course), a very nice breakfast with good selections is served. Strong recommendation to make sure the breakfast is included in your reservation! - The rooms (also the standard ones) are spacious and modern. The bathrooms are very spacious and nicely built & decorated. Two separate sinks, separate large shower, separate toilet niche and a bathtub. Plenty of space in the corridors which small entrance niches for 2-3 rooms each ensures a very quiet experience overall. Beds are a bit hard (French style), but still comfortable. - A small gym with two small sauna available at the hotel. Nothing fantastic, but ensures a break if you need one. - Parking garage in the building ensures neat access to the hotel. 18 EUR a day is to be considered appropriate, but not a bargain. - Good rates over the weekend - and a nice family offer, giving the second room for half the price of the first one. 182 EUR for the first, 91 for the second (incl. breakfast). For a hotel of this quality (and with such a good breakfast included), it was actually a good price. Now to the flaws: - Upon arrival, there wasn't an extra bed in either of our two hotel rooms even if that was agreed upon in the reservation. I reminded the reception staff about it after check-in. Once returning to the hotel in the evening, it was still not there. One more reminder and then it eventually came. - The cleaning of the rooms were still ongoing at 5 pm at our second day.

Breakfast may be taken in the main restaurant however on the two occassions I used it the restaurant was busy with a good 30 minute wait for eggs cooked to order.Although the choice was more limited in the Club Etoile lounge the hostess was more than happy to have eggs cooked to order sent up. - nice touch!

Everything was sparkling and gleaming. It was a pleasure to arrive \u2013 there is a bell-boy at the entrance to greet you and help with the bags. An additional big advantage over some other hotels claiming 5-star rating in Germany was the very helpful staff both receptionists and the concierge were attentive and knowledgeable. I had a tight train connection going to another city, and a young lady at the Front desk had a great advice to take an earlier outbound regional train to connect to ICE train at Berlin Hauptbahnhof. The concierge was excellent in suggesting taking the buses 100 or 200 to get to Berlin Gemaldegalerie and Museum Island; also explaining a U-Bahn ride to Deutsche Opera and the fare information. All the information I have received from the staff was accurate, in addition they all spoke fluent English, which turned out to be rarity in East Germany, not as much in the capital of Berrin, though. This hotel is a perfection and a great value for a 5-star hotel. A few points on critique would be - I\u2019ve stayed for two nights and the linen was not changed on the second day with a sign \"per your request we have not changed the linen\". I have not requested that, however - and think they should at least remove this imposing statement. And for a hotel of this quality, they should change it by default, and leave it per request. I am not sure if the turn-down service is by default, too \u2013 learning from prior stays in East Germany hotels, I prudently requested it, and it was perfectly delivered. Being picky, there is no swimming pool - although in most hotels in Germany with pools the water is too cold to swim anyway. Overall, out of many superior hotels I\u2019ve stayed in I must say that at 133 euro per night including breakfast flexible (not-prepaid!) rate, this hotel deserves more than 5 stars; compared to some 5-star hotels in Munich or Paris this one is shining of impeccable cleanliness, modern comforts and exceptional service. I highly recommend Hotel Concorde, and next time I will also try Hotel Esplanade Berlin for a comparison, since they have a pool and are more expensive, so I wonder what more Berlin can offer. However, I will stay in Concorde for sure since it made me so happy, and I believe the management deserves the highest praise for such an exceptionally great establishment so well-run.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cSo close to Five points...\u201d", "Author": "ccrr77fr", "ReviewID": "UR68325101", "Content": "Usually, i tend to give the famous five points only to the Elite hotels providing the highest standard of service and the most yummy food and offering a perfect design, a marvellous decoration and the ultimate comfort. However, today, i've hesitated a lot to give these 5 points to Concorde Berlin but i did not cause of a few very little details but in general, i've been more than satisfied with the great great hotel so well located in the nicest area of Berlin. My partner and me booked at this hotel and we have had an incredible deal. I was even a bit surprised how a five stars property could offer such an impressive rate and i was a bit worry. However, right away we arrived at the front of the hotel, i feel the excellent standard of service provided by a well trained staff happy to offer the best of themselves. The doorman took our baggages immediatly and the front desk officer was very nice and so professionnal. He even offered us the possibility to get upgraded in a Jr Suite or an Executive Room (with Club benefits) for just a few 50 euros more but we declined this offer since we were in Berlin to celebrate the Gay pride and we had busy outside plans. Since our room was not ready, we have been escorted to the bar for a complimentary glass of wine or beer and 10 minutes after, the room was ready and the baggages already transferred on it... Such an excellent service... About the decoration, this hotel offers a very good modern design with some statues in the lobby and the corridors, some ultra trendy paintings in the rooms and a good blend of warm colours giving you a good impression to feel in your own place away from home. The size of the room was a little bit small. However, the large windows overlooking the Kaiser Wilhelm Ged\u00e4chtniskirche and the rooftops of the high class shopping area of Kurf\u00fcnstendamm gives an impression of an airy room very clear and comfortable. The bathroom was large in comparaison with the room with a separate toilet, shower and bathtub, two sinks and the very exclusive Annick Goutal amenities. The equipment is very good as well and the hotel offers complimentary internet access from the room (so not often in Europe). About the room service, this is very good even if the choice is quite limited but the quality is really excellent and the prices so affordable just like the mini bar (just 9.50\u20ac for half of a bottle of Sancerre...). So why i don't give 5 points? Simply because an automatic turn down service (you still can request for sure) would be good and some fresh fruits would be a special touch on arrival as well as a newspaper in front of the room door every morning. But there are details so easy to improve and in the meantime, you'll have the smile of this staff, one of the nicest i've seen in Europe. Down to the hotel, there is a very interesting concept of italian restaurant nammed Vapiano, very cheap and just yummy... So, let's say Concorde Hotel is maybe the best choice you can do in Berlin and i think this is the best location for shopping addicts but for clubbers as well...

After reading Trip Advisor reviews on several prime location hotels I finally decided to stay at the Hotel Concorde. The Hotel Concorde reviews were all positive with many glowing references, and I too was not to be disappointed with our 'Dine in Style Package' stay at the hotel. On arrival at the hotel we were informed that we had been upgraded from a Superior Room to a Junior Suite on the 10th Floor and reservations were made immediately for us for a table on both nights at the 'Le Faubourg\" restaurant. The Junior Suite had a wonderful view looking towards the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedachtnis-Kirche, and was spacious, well designed and extremely comfortable. The 'Dine in Style Package' consisted of accommodation, American Breakfast, and a three course dinner for the both of us for 242 Euros per night. At breakfast the restaurant served a wide selection of specialist teas and had an excellent selection of food including a chef being permanently on hand to freshly cook a choice of omelette, eggs, pancakes, waffles and crepes. Champagne was also available for those people who like to start their day with a buck's fizz. Dinner served in the \"Le Faubourg\" restaurant was also first class. On the first night the starter consisted of pan-grilled king prawns on a bed of couscous, with a main course of chicken, and a apple sorbet for dessert. On the second night the starter was a salad, a main course of entrecote, and for dessert a selection of different flavoured creme brulee. This was followed by a selection of chocolates. The cost of this package might appear expensive to some, however, if one takes into account the cost of breakfast and dinner for two people would be in excess of 110 Euros per day, then the cost of 130 Euros per night for accommodation of this high standard is most certainly good value. The hotel is ideally located to Berlin's transport system and all of the hotel's staff were friendly, helpful and extremely knowledgeable about the beautiful city of Berlin. Would I recommend this hotel to others - Yes. Would I go back to this hotel - most certainly.

There is a flat screen TV with many channels but not much for Americans other than CNN. The bathroom is spacious, with separate tub and shower, two sinks, and nice amenities, such as bathrobes.

Dinner in the hotel restaurant was very good and the service was excellent. There is also a nice bar with a spacious sitting area -- great for relaxing with friends or business colleagues.

The concierge had, but the hotel could not produce a single FedEx (or other overnight company) box. So, I ended up carrying the items with me.

Let me start by saying that I had pre-payed for 2 rooms for 3 nights beginning on the 9th of June 2008. We had just arrived from a long haul flight from Vancouver Canada, we were dead tired and travelling with a toddler. When we arrived at the hotel I was told by the check-in lady that there was a problem which was \"nothing bad\" and that her colleage was coming to talk to me. This colleage was the assistant front manager named Antje Kuschel. We were informed by Antje that the hotel had made an overbooking error and would have to relocate to another hotel in the area. All of my efforts to explain that I had booked the Cocorde because I specifically wanted a new, modern hotel with large rooms were in vain. I was told that the hotel was all full, and inspite of the fact that we had pre-paid to stay there, we would have to move. There was a convention taking place in the hotel at the time (Hewlett Packard). After buying us complimentary drinks in the restaurant, we were sent to the Streigenberger Hotel down the street where we were told that we were being given \"deluxe rooms\", an apparent upgrade from the standard rooms which we had booked at the Concorde. The rooms at the Steigenberger were terrible. The beds were queen sized (not the king which I had booked at the Concorde), the rooms old and tired and the curtains did not cover the window and had big holes in the blackout. None of this was the fault of the Steigenberger, they made every attempt to accomodate us and find rooms which made us happy. Antje never checked back to see if we were indeed happy or made any effort to accompany us to the new hotel. We were simply dumped there. That evening I returned to the Concorde and spoke with Antje once again. She was made aware of my unhappiness with the substituted hotel rooms. She apologized profusely and said that she would absolutely get us moved back into the Concorde the next night. I asked twice if she had our contact info, she said yes, she would get a message to us at the Steigenberger ASAP. Long story short, I NEVER heard from her again in spite of checking front desk messages and voicemail repeatedly. Two days later I returned to the desk at the Concorde in order to ask Antje what had happened and was informed that she had been off for the last two days. In my opinion, the Concorde never had any intention of attempting to make the situation right. The whole experience was horrible and ruined our trip to Berlin.

The hotel was excellent overall and exceeded my expectations, despite the relatively high pricetag (\u00a3100 GBP per night for B&B). Arriving at the hotel in a taxi, the door staff greeted me and escorted me into the reception area with my luggage. I declined the offer of having my luggage taken directly to my room while I checked in. The check-in process was hassle-free and without incident, which I was pleased about since I'd booked the hotel (via a third party website) less than 24 hours prior to my arrival. The public areas of the hotel are extremely well-appointed; lots of money has clearly been spent on the fresh, modern decor. The room did not fail to impress - it was spacious and tastefully furnished with a large king bed, oversized writing desk, flatscreen TV, minibar and all the usual conveniences of a 5 star hotel. The bathroom opened off a separate dressing area, and was well equipped with two sinks, a large bath with shower attachment as well as a separate walk-in shower cubicle, and of course a toilet. The whole room was spotlessly clean, and I wasn't disturbed by any outside noise during my stay. Being on holiday I wasn't in the hotel that much during the day, but from my occasional return visits to drop things off I worked out that housekeeping was servicing the room at least twice daily (ie my mess was being cleared up at least twice a day!), though I didn't actually encounter any of the staff. Breakfast was a self-service buffet; it was of good quality, but it would probably have been much more economical to go to a nearby bakery / deli etc for breakfast if it hadn't been included in the room rate, than to pay the standard hotel charge. One down side to breakfast was that getting to the dining room involved walking past the conference centre, with crowds of delegates smoking in the corridor - Germany apparently hasn't caught up with us in the UK on the no-indoor-smoking front! I had room-service dinner one night, which was delivered quickly and as ordered. It was nice, but I guess I could probably have gotten a cheaper hamburger and chips outside the hotel! The business centre was well equipped with broadband internet, and provided a quiet environment to check email, confirm flight arrangements and so on. Access was by passcard and using a password supplied at reception at check-in. The concierge was also very useful for directing me to u-bahn stations, and giving advice on the quickest way to get to places I wanted to see in and around Berlin. Check-out was handled efficiently and without incident, and the door staff summoned a taxi from the nearby rank to take me to the airport at the end of my stay.
