Looked at lots of places and so glad we stayed in Paia and at the Paia Inn. My boyfriend and I are generally low maintenance and don't require much but we like a quiet, clean, comfortable spot at the end of the day. Certainly more pricey than other options in the area, but I picked the Paia Inn because I knew we wouldn't have to worry about anything. The staff is awesome - how many times do you come back after dinner and the hotel staff greet you by your first name because they remember it from the day before. Our room (#2) was small, which I knew when I booked. But we were hardly in our room except to sleep and plan our day. If you are worried about a small room, then go outside - you're on vacation. If I stayed in the room, I would have used the provided AppleTV to watch netflix. We are early risers and Anthony's Coffee shop across the street opens at like 5:30am so we always had amazing coffee (the hotel has complimentary coffee for later risers). We used the free parking lot a block from the hotel so no charges there. We didn't use the private beach access but I overheard that it was redone. We ate breakfast at the hotel on our last day and it was really good. Would easily stay at the Paia Inn again and have no hesitation recommending it to a friend.

It's a gem! We couldn't have been happier with our stay there. The staff are all very friendly and accommodating, and the rooms are extremely comfortable. Someone was always ready to help. They'll even take your luggage from the car to the room. There are so many little touches that make the difference between having a place to stay and a place to call home for a few days. For example, the inn has a noise machine in every room--not because there are bothersome noises to mask, but just to help make sure guests get a good night's sleep. The bedding, linens and toiletries are all top-rate. The inn has its own beach access and provides chairs, towels and beach toys. The tree-covered courtyard is where custom-made breakfasts are prepared, and they are delicious. The location is great--right on the Hana Highway, in the middle of the business district. The rooms are all in the back, though, so there is no street noise at all. There are two computers and a printer, which was a great help when we needed to print boarding passes. We had a two bedroom suite, and it had a fully-equipped kitchen. While we didn't prepare and cook food, it would be a great convenience and savings for those who want to do that. We appreciated just having a nice big refrigerator with cold water and ice, with room to store fruit, beverages and restaurant leftovers that we could reheat the next day. The small living room had only a three seat couch, however, and the kitchen table sat four. This was adequate for us (three people) but might be a problem for bigger groups. The bedrooms were small and didn't have much space for storing clothes or even leaving an open suitcase, but the beds are super comfortable. There are flowering trees everywhere.

My room (1) was small (and without a window), but the bed was comfy, the furnishings nice, and the bathroom felt pretty luxurious. The staff was super friendly, too -- as was every person I spoke with in Paia. There's no elevator, but they'll help you with your stuff. Parking is tricky in town, so you'll want to snag a spot in the designated parking lot down the block. The beach access is nice, although it was overcast and drizzly for most of the day I was here, so I didn't get to partake much. My one quibble is that the price is really high for what you get -- which is a small room -- and because it's an inn, they lack some of the amenities that the resorts offer.

This is a small boutique hotel that just sounded so quaint online that we decided to try it. We got their least expensive room because it was the cheapest, even though it looked quite small in the photo and the hotel itself suggested we might want to upgrade to a slightly larger room. But we figured for one night it didn't matter.....and it didn't! This little hotel was delightful! Paia is a tiny town known for its \"hippie\", laid back style, and is a tourist draw so it is always very crowded. That was true at the hotel also. I think they only have 6 rooms in total, and very little space to park in back so it is OK to park behind the person who got there before you, and you just give your keys to the person at the desk so they can move the cars around if need be. The room was small but just fine for the two of us. Tiny little bathroom, just big enough for a toilet and shower. Bed was probably just a double but fine for the two of us and VERY comfortable. Little touches everywhere, from the classy furnishings to the paintings on the walls everywhere. Tina, the beautiful young lady at the desk (in the back of the building, not the front) helped us with our bags and made us feel right at home. It is just a short walk out the back of the building down to the beach with its spectacular views of the north shore of Maui and we even saw a whale spout off in the distance. The next morning in the cute little patio out back, the good-looking chef cooked up a great spinach omelette for us before we hit the road for our two day trip to Hana.

Our stay at the Paia Inn got better from there. The rooms were clean, well furnished, and charming. Our suite included a small kitchen, and enclosed lanai. When we booked the room, we asked for a \"garden view\" room. In my experience, garden view rooms usually mean you have a window or door that looks out onto small garden used by everyone in the hotel. We were most pleasantly surprised to find that our garden view actually looked out onto our own private garden complete with picnic table, chairs and banana trees. We were invited to help ourselves to the banana's if they were ripe. The hotel lobby and a few rooms are in a two story building that fronts on Paia's main street. The majority of the rooms and suites are located in what appeared to be converted dwellings that stretched back from the lobby to the beach. At the very back, overlooking the beach, is a 3 bedroom beach house. The hotel has a private beach access (the beach itself, is public) that runs the length of the property, surrounded by high wooden fences and bamboo. Beach chairs, towels, water and boogie boards are provided for hotel guests at no extra charge. Granted, the weather on Maui's north shore tends to be cooler, windier and a tad wetter than in the tourist oriented areas of Wailea and Makeena, but this is more than compensated by Paia's proximity to the Hana Highway, Ho'okipa beach, the uplands area or Maui, and the airport. Even better, one is in the middle of Paia and its charming shops. The Paia Inn does not have a restaurant of its own, but some of Maui's best restaurants are a few minutes walk from the hotel. For the units with a kitchen, the local grocery store has some of the best prices of any grocery store on Maui, as well as fresh baked pasties each morning. The bedrooms of our suite were a little on the small side, and it required some thought to store our clothes and suitcases such that we were not tripping over them. However, this is a minor quibble. The Paia Inn, as charming as it is, may not be to everyone's liking. If you go on holidays expecting your rooms to be utterly posh, with room service, fully stocked bar and every conceivable amenity within arm's reach at any given moment, you best try one of the resorts at Wailea. (I am not being cynical with this comment, as I have friends who will quite openly state such expectations of an hotel.) On the other hand, if you like something a little different, and your activities in Hawaii will consist of more than lying by a pool frying yourself, you cannot do much better than this hotel.

Tina's service went above-and-beyond multiple times to ensure our comfort. 2) Breakfasts and the dining area: the Inn has an adorable, small, enclosed patio that is perfect for breakfast or an evening drink. They also have a chef (Situs) on-site who will whip up delicious, tropical concoctions for breakfast (not included in the room price, but well worth having a few times...or every day, in our case). The omelettes and pancakes were our favorites. 3) The rooms...choose one with an outdoor shower! 4) Location: both the town of Pa'ia, the slightly-more rugged coast, and the access to great hikes along the Road to Hana made it very attractive to us.

The staff at the Paia Inn truly are friendly and helpful, and did their best to be kind and helpful. But I feel I should offer a bit of balance since the other reviews, which we relied on to decide on the Paia, now seem overly gushing in their praise. First for a few of the other positives (in addition to the great staff), which are undeniable. The Inn is nicely located in a small town on the North Shore of Maui. Through the rear of the property it is possible to reach the beach, and most visitors will rightly appreciate this. We were given a suite on the ground floor behind the main building, which was quiet and pleasant. The furnishings are comfy and modern. What's not to love? Unfortunately, we found the rooms to be rather cramped or poorly laid out even in our otherwise large suite. Not really a big deal, but for the high price ($360/night), I think we should expect not to bark are shins getting in and out of bed. This was a minor problem in truth, however. Most regrettably of all, I must report that the rooms were not as clean as they ought to have been. We like to walk barefoot, but the floors were in need of a good scrub and our feet became dirty walking about the kitchen area. There was sand -- beach sand to be sure, but not just a little in our shower when we checked in. The shower could not have been properly cleaned beforehand and it wasn't while we were there either.

The rooms are modern and welcoming, the beds comfy, the bathrooms high-end...right down to the living space in the upstairs of the main hotel which is for use by guests and comes complete with internet access, books, games and aftersun) - The location is perfect for exploring Paia, and is right opposite Anthony's Coffee House (an absolute must visit, the coffee and food is great) and lots of boutiques to nose around - The hotel's beach access... Paia provides towels and sun loungers for guests and the stretch of beach accessible from the hotel is just stunning and perfect for lazing on the beach, taking a dip in the water, or just watching the surfers - Breakfast...most important meal of the day and Paia Inn's doesn't disappoint. Sitting outside in the glorious sunshine, the breakfast was delicious (I had my first ever waffles there) and the fruit smoothies were so fresh. We also met the owner on the last day who was just as welcoming and hospitable as his staff, helping us to get our luggage to the car ready to head to our next stop.

Pa'ia is a small \"hippie\" town on the main road to Hana, just 4 miles from the main Maui airport. Pa'ia has two gas stations, some yoga/tattoo businesses and a few good restaurants. It's the anti-Wailea. I like that since Maui has changed over the past 30 years and I'm not sure it's a good thing. If you look at the Pa'ia Inn on the surface, you see an old main street storefront with a yoga shop and gelato/sandwich place around the side, next to a gas station. The entrance is not even in front of the building, it's around the back. What???? Parking is in a tiny lot behind the building where cars double-park. Three other buildings make up the additional \"rooms\" of the Inn with one complete house available for the ultimate experience. A collections of building in a hippie town, why would anyone (other than hippies) care? This is the point where worlds collide as multiple sensations attack your senses at once. If you have just arrived on the island, it's a bit jarring. Once you find the entrance and park your car, the real spirit of Aloha hits you hard. Walking into the entrance of the Inn, you pass through a large courtyard of shade trees and other people (guests?) relaxing, drinking beer or wine, eating fruit provided by the hotel. You look at them (\"who are these people?\") as they point you to the refreshments. You suddenly feel overdressed, over stressed and very out of place. About then, one of the hotel staff greet you in the most informal/friendly way. A lovely brunette girl/woman who you imagine will go surfing after work. A young man from Spain who happens to be the breakfast chef. Smiles, welcomes, good vibes. It continues this way during your entire stay. After a few hours, a meal and some time to relax, you melt into the place. New people arrive, you feel a need to say \"join us, relax\". The staff rotates but the service is amazingly friendly. Restaurant recommendations? Path to the beach? Best places to buy swimwear? No problem! We had just one night at the Pa'ia Inn since our condo wasn't ready until the next day, but I've got to say that next time I have to stay longer in Pa'ia. When the staff called me a few days later to follow up and ask for feedback, I felt like I was hearing from an old friend. I actually missed their friendly demeanor after a week of dealing with the crazy tourist strain on the west side of Maui. Since this is a review, all I can say as a warning is that the rooms that face the main street in Pa'ia should be avoided if you are a medium-to-light sleeper. Truck traffic is heavy and the noise was disruptive to us. Otherwise, the room we had (#3) was comfy and well maintained. It wasn't a large room, but then you won't want to spend time in the room at all, you'll want to be on the beach or in the courtyard with new friends.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cQuirky but delightful\u201d", "Author": "Oldhanwellian", "ReviewID": "UR99270879", "Content": "There are good things and less good (but definitely not bad) things to say about the Paia Inn To get the weak points over first: it's on a main road; we didn't find this a problem as far as noise is concerned, but f you're looking for delightful views from your room, this isn't the place.

The location in Paia Town is great. Paia is a town that makes you really feel like you are in true Hawaii, not some developers creation of it. The stores, the restaurants (Love \"Flatbread Pizza!\") in Paia are worthy of discovery. And I love the beach at the hotel. Unlike some of the bigger hotels, I can leave my room and be on the sand in---what--1.5 minutes? (one minute if I'm particularly ready to dive in the ocean). To alleviate a previous parking challenge, the Inn just added a new parking lot which is two minutes walk from the hotel--try getting from your car to your room in most big hotels in two minutes. And don't get me wrong. I love some of the bigger hotels on the island and have stayed in all of them over the years (I even got married at the Four Seasons Maui), and I love the water slides at the Grand Wailea, not a fan of the walk from the rooms to the beach at the Ritz Carlton.

After reading the skepticism voiced in the forums, I had some trepidation as our stay approached, and promised to write an objective review upon our return. So here it is . . . If you need the large resort and hotel amenities, you will be disappointed. if you need an expansive view of the beach from your room, you will be disappointed. However, if you want attentive, personalized service, thoughtfully appointed rooms, and a convenient launching point for upcountry and Hana activities, the Paia Inn is perfect for you, as it was for us! Two of our three days on Maui involved upcountry activities and the Road to Hana, so we appreciated the shorter \"commute\" by having our homebase in Paia. Also, you can't beat that 10-15 minute commute from the Kahului airport. If you want to spend a lot of time on the west side of Maui, then you have more drive time, but the day we did explore that part of the island, we enjoyed stopping at the Maui swap meet Saturday morning, then making a brief stop to wander the paths at Iao Needle, and finally going on to Lahaina, which perhaps was 45 minutes from the Inn. A lovely drive, but happy not to have that extra 1-2 hours of drive time tacked on to my Road to Hana day, which involved enough driving from Paia! It is frankly hard to evaluate the value of the pricing -- it is a not a \"cheap\" room, but there is nothing comparable in Paia itself within walking distance to the charming shops and numerous (reasonably priced!) restaurants, and i really don't think you can compare it to the overwhelming choices on the west or south side of Maui where price competition can be stiffer and you can perhaps find a bargain. I don't think for the money you could find as lovely a room as the Junior Suite we stayed in -- very spacious, eclectically decorated, and we were very impressed by the numerous thoughtful details in the bathroom, the kitchen, and elsewhere. We were located in a separate building toward the back of the property, so had no issues with street noise, and got great nights' sleep. It was relaxing to spend time in the room itself, as well as on the Inn's fenced patio area that featured a great mix of tunes streaming in the evening. Appreciated the free wi-fi (with either their computer in the common lounge area, or using your own) and use of their printer to print boarding passes. We were too busy to do more than take a peek at the beautiful beach a short walk from the back of the Inn, but if you need beach time, it's just a pathway away. We took advantage of borrowing a cooler from the beach toys closet for our day on the Hana Highway, and my husband commented how the Inn had a lot of nice equipment for the beach to check out but the closet was a disorganized jumble. The luggage storage was a little disconcerting, as you were given the combination to another storage shed on the premises (not in the main office building), which who knows how many other people had access to, but our luggage (including my laptop which I locked to my suitcase handle) was just fine after a day of exploring before our flight left that evening. The parking is free, but with the expansion of lodging offerings at the Inn, there may be more guest cars than parking spots. It is first-come, first-serve, so if the lot is full you have street parking or the public lot a block away. You drop your keys at the desk if you block someone else's car in, so that your car can be moved if the other guest needs out before you do. The parking situation can be viewed as somewhat a negative feature of the Inn, but it worked just fine for us with our rental car, and the staff was very helpful and eager to make sure it wasn't a hassle for you, as much as they could. While continental breakfast was included at the time we booked our room, it is no longer an amenity, although paid contenental or hot breakfast was available on-site in their patio area. While there is not a fitness center on-site, you have access to the local fitness center as part of your stay, with a pass provided. The service and friendliness of the staff was what others had noted it to be - - a sincere desire to help you enjoy your stay at the Inn and in Paia, with helpful recommendations for area activities, dining choices, etc. It is a big plus mark for this Inn, and my husband and I commented on how much friendlier and attentive the Inn was to its guests, in contrast to the impersonal (but very stately/beautiful) Moana Surfrider. Another huge asset for the Inn is the town itself -- we loved it the minute we drove into it. No need to dress or shower again before dinner -- we went straight from hiking to dinner at Milagros down the street. We also enjoyed our dinner next door at the Flatbread Pizza Company. And for that special dinner on Maui, Mama's Fish House is only a mile or so down the road. We found the shopping in Paia diverse enough along with the shops a short drive away in Makawao to meet our needs, such that Lahaina was a touristy let-down for us -- both dining and shopping-wise. We enjoyed Paia much more. Many of the restaurants/bars have evening music and while the shopping shuts down relatively early, there were plenty of places to hang out and have a cocktail or listen to music if you wanted a later night out. So, in closing, we would highly recommend Paia Inn for your vacation homebase if you are looking for a laid-back slice of Maui.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel -\u201d", "Author": "Travelling_Dutchman9", "ReviewID": "UR86704555", "Content": "We had a lovely stay at the Paia Inn - we booked here a few nights for our honeymoon following the raving TripAdvisor reviews.

There simply was no comparison. Waikiki was very commercial and busy. The Paia Inn was welcoming, cozy and very memorable. We enjoy staying in boutique hotels because of the intimacy and ambiance. Very different from the larger chains. The town of Paia is very close to the airport which really can make a difference in setting the tone for the trip. The staff was wonderful especially Nina. Nothing was a problem or issue. It just was resolved. Not that we had any problems at the Inn. The breakfast was very nice. If you wanted something more than the complimentary breakfast of delicious fruit and pastries, the chef was there to make you anything you wanted. The couryard where you could eat had such a relaxing and tropical feel. Even the reception area was decorated so nicely with the local artists prints and Pier One furniture and accessories. Great Look! We stayed in room 7 which was very nice. The bamboo flooring, travertine shower area and furniture were nice also. It felt like a very upscale beachy type inn. We would have like a little more room in the bedroom. With the suitcases in the room it became very small but after a while we figured out a workable system. Althought the shower area was very nice it was small. However the water pressure for washing off the remaining sand was great! As was the amount of hot water, which tends to be a problem in hotels. The AC was nice to have when you came back from the beach and the room was too warm. Now the beach. How cute the walk to the beach is!!! You meander thru some of the common outdoor areas to the other rooms and down two long passageways lined with art pieces on the fences. You can pick up your gratis chair, boogie board at the end and it opens up to a BEAUTIFUL private beach. Clean, beautiful crystal clear water. It is not tranquil however but fun trying to get back on the beach thru the waves. Could have stayed on the beach the whole time. Mesmerizing. The town of Paia is great. Eclectic shops (and people). Loved Flatbread Pizza, Gelato, Charley's for breakfast a must and Cafe Mambo. The shops are great and you could spend a couple of hours just wandering thru them. Not only your traditional touristy things but some very unique items also. Great location for taking the Hana Highway trip since it is the beginning of it. All in all a great not so little town with a great location, nice people, cute shops and a GREAT Inn. Thanks to Trip Advisor.

Nina was always welcoming, always accommodating, 100% service oriented, and had helpful suggestions for area activities. Nina provided spot on customer service.

This place and the town of Paia are amazing... We landed in Maui after dark and got to the inn about 9pm. We walked in, weary from the day of travel and Carly asks - are you my California Couple? She was expecting us, and offered a glass of wine while we checked in - I knew then that we were in good hands with this crew and inn. This was just the perfect start to an unbelievably great stay. We stayed in a deluxe room (with an outdoor shower you shouldn't miss if you have the choice!) for 5 days before moving to Hana for a couple of days. During this time, Paia Inn served as a great home base for everything from day trips to swim in freshwater holes, hikes, trips to the westside, and exploring the upcountry area. The beach at the inn is phenomenal. Seriously - what more do you need than powder white beaches and clear blue water? Swimming... boogie boarding (they supply them! and beach chairs/umbrellas)... lounging... and more lounging... this beach is perfect for all of these things. Not crowded. We also took a stand-up paddleboarding lesson one morning that i would highly recommend. Every thing about the inn is just amazing - but the staff is probably the standout. The owner Michael, Carly, Nina and the rest of the girls (and guy!) at the inn were nothing but completely enthusiastic and helpful during our entire stay. And the complimentary breakfast we were treated to every morning was way, way better than average! We even decided that we'd come back after our trip to Hana and they booked us two more nights on our return. This time though, the only rooms they had available were above the reception with street facing windows...it's a good thing we weren't in that room for the 5 days before because truthfully, i think we would have been disappointed had that been all we'd experienced. But by the time we got back from Hana we were ready for a little noise (you'll know what i mean if you stay in Hana!) and didn't mind the noise in the morning and the lights at night. All things considered, it was a fabulous vacation experience staying in Paia and at the Inn, if you're looking for relaxation, with the option for a little adventure thrown in from time to time - this is the place. If you're looking to stay on the island and not have to deal with all the resort stuff - this is the place. If you're interested in doing a little exploring in the area and need some personal recommendations from some of the coolest hotel staff ever - this is the place. As if our experience wasn't mind-blowing enough...my boyfriend tops it off with a marriage proposal on our last night, during a sunset picnic on the beach! (with an inn-supplied cooler of course).

The toiletries are first class, the sheets are super soft, the pillows are great, and it is a short (30 second) walk to the beach. The waters there are clear and crystal clear. There are a variety of restaurants and bars within walking distance, as well as a nice specialty grocer, Mana foods. There are many small boutiques that my wife loved, but be prepared to bring some cash. Our favorites: Anthony's for breakfast/coffee. Flatbread, Moana Cafe, Maligros for dinner.

Unfortunately we had an agenda for the day, so when it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrived at 7:30, we left to just get breakfast on the way somewhere. The same thing happened the next day, so we were very disappointed with the breakfast set up. The worst part of our stay was the noise from the street. The Inn is next to a Chevron gas station, not to mention located on the main street of the town, and they love diesel trucks there. Loud vehicles were roaring through every few minutes, night and day. Plus, some adjacent business, I think the gelato shop below the inn, was obnoxiously blasting loud music throughout the entire day. Even with the windows, blinds, and curtains closed, the noise was unbearable, and we got little sleep the 3 nights we were there. Although we had booked for a whole week, we needed to go somewhere more tranquil. WARNING: the garbage truck comes at 4am in the morning!

BOTTOM LINE: we loved it here. i had high expectations from all the rave reviews, so a few small annoyances bothered me more than they would have if i had gone expecting it to be more like my friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house. PROS - i love how INTIMATE AND PERSONAL the place feels. don't expect cute mini bottles of shampoo and conditioner, but instead, a basket full of sunscreens and other toiletries (see photo), left by previous travelers, that make this place feel more home-y and less hotel-y. - i love the ECLECTIC STYLE, with an antique rickshaw in the courtyard (see photo), weathered teak furniture and southeastern asian touches. - the COTTAGE YARD is bliss. reclining on the chaise, glancing up from your book to see the majestic view, listening to the waves and the kids laugh....ahhh, now that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what i call a vacation. - during low tide, the TIDEPOOLS on the beach (see photo) directly in front of the property is a paradise, especially for small kids. there is even a small stone wall upon which you can recline while they explore. during high tide, the beach waves are a bit strong for little ones, but it is wonderfully secluded. - Nina and the other inn staff WORK HARD. - the owner is very RECEPTIVE to suggestions for improving the place. for example, there's no AC in the main rooms of the cottage and it was hotter than outside and he said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be installing a new unit. - Paia is an AMAZING LITTLE TOWN. the only place i've found on the island with chic little shops (wish there were a Puka Puka boutique and Mana Foods where i live!). CONS - in general, i'm not shy about requests, but here, the FRONT DESK always seemed so busy attending to the more important needs of other customers that i didn't bother with small stuff. on one occasion, Nina had been dealing with an unhappy customer by the time i asked her for help printing out our boarding passes. she was quick to assess the issue as not her problem but a problem with the airline. i suspect if she had been in a better head-space or if she had more help, she would have been more helpful. - the cottages' private beachfront grassy yard is so lovely, but during our stay, there was a strong CHEMICAL ODOR - like spray paint or polyeurathane. we suspect one of the neighbors was working. i heard a few people complain, and though it's not the Inn's fault, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helpful to remember that this is not a giant resort where they have total control over their environs. - there's NO POOL. but who needs a pool when you have the crystal clear waters of Maui? try telling that to your child, i guess...", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPaia Inn, worth every penny\u201d", "Author": "Josh4023", "ReviewID": "UR71021816", "Content": "What more can be said about this place?

Our room had two bedrooms and a living area and was a good amount of space for that many people. We originally had a one br, but they let us know about an upgrade opportunity for $20 more per night, and we jumped on it for 2 br's. The Inn is lovely, with warm touches everywhere. Great toiletries. Comfy beds. Clean. Location is superb, and it was refreshing to not be in a big expensive resort hotel with hidden fees. Before reading this next part, know I still highly recommend the Paia Inn...so book with confidence. A few weeks before our stay, I called them to cancel the first out of three nights since our travel plans changed. I spoke with a very nice woman who said it was no problem and they'd take care of it. When we arrived for our stay, we were questioned about being \"late\" and not arriving for the first day of our stay. When I mentioned that I did call to cancel the first day weeks prior, I was told it \"wasn't a problem\" but then in the same breath that it's \"nice to know if someone's not coming so they can use that room for someone else\" (even though I cancelled). Then they apologized and said that next time they'll make sure to take better notes when someone calls to cancel - but then in that same breath - I was told a story about a \"guy who once said the same thing but later on admitted he never called to cancel\". I didn't know if I was being apologized to, not taken seriously, or understood. Just confusing and a little annoying. The staff was still wonderful to us, besides that (even that same person). *On a side note for Paia Inn - I did get a nice voicemail from them the day they thought we were supposed to come in. Unfortunately, I didn't get it until after the trip since I just got the new iPhone4 and hadn't yet set up my voicemail retrieving.* Only a couple other slightly negative things - - no pool, but you do have a wonderful beach within a very short walk. - no view from the room, but the rooms are great and ours had a cute porch - our a/c in one of the br's made a strange noise so we couldn't use it, but there was another in the living room area which sufficed - lovely breakfast foods are said to be ready by 7 am, but it was a little later when everything was always set up. 7 am might be early to some on vacation, but I'd imagine most come from the mainland and there's a time difference which makes you get up early! - sending out an email after our stay to thank us, but then a link to Trip Advisor. Makes all the reviews feel a bit pushed. - we found and demolished a roach on the floor (BIG ONE). I imagine most places on the island may face the same battles, though. Tips - - Stay here for a couple nights when first flying into Maui since it's close to the airport. - Stop at Costco along the way and buy your drinks/food since there's a full fridge. - Easy to do the Road to Hana from this location...get a boxed lunch from across the street at the coffee shop (great coffee!).", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cPaia Inn, What you need to know first!

I have stayed at many first class resorts and I have stayed at some economy hotels as well. My choices have been determined by what the trip was for. Romantic getaway with my wife, a resort is needed. Dive trip with my son, anything will do. This trip I was traveling with my son and his wife. Twenty somethings. The IPhone generation. And my wife. This was the \"kids\" yearly vacation so first class resorts were in order. Our plan was to stay at different locations on Maui, and explore each one. Our first stay was at the Paia Inn for three nights. Paia Inn review. So where do I start? No. 1 Maui Hotel? No, sorry it's not. But it was the best for .......... The road to Hana. If you turn around at 7 Pools Oheo gulch past Hana then head back staying here saves a bunch of time. Haleakala. A sunrise trip to the top is murder from Kaanapali. I know Iv'e done it. From here it's much shorter. Paia it's self. This is a great town. With great places to eat and shop. And you are right in the center of it. There are many small towns/places close nearby that should not be missed. Makawau is a must. Try to see the lavender fields. And the Goat farm is also close by. I don't think the Paia Inn can be beat for this side of the island. But you need to know some things first. I believe the Inn's high rating is due to the people that work there. The girls that work here are the best. Hands down the best customer service you will find on the Island. Where the Inn lacks is in it's rooms. And the they don't lack much. But! This IS the highest rated hotel on the Island! The 3 bedroom suite we stayed in had only 1 bathroom. Do not stay in this unit if there are more than 4 adults. The Bathroom also has not been remodeled as some in the website show. Do you NEED an air conditioner? Our Suite Had ceiling fans only. While it is on the 2nd floor, and the breezes are good here, a fifty+ year old woman with hot flashes will have some problems. Or so I'm told. The view was limited from the Lanai. It's only partial Ocean. The only bbq is reserved for the cottage and we were not allowed to use it. Make sure when you make your reservation to ask all the questions. Some reviews have dogged the beach here but we loved the beach here. Great snorkeling about 200 yards out. However it is not for the young or timid. Paddle Boarding is also awesome here. So would I stay here again? YES! But I'm sorry to say that there better places on the Island. We moved on to the Aston Mahana and Wialea Marriott.

The Pa'ia Inn is nice, and the staff was outstanding, but this is far from Shangri La. We had a two-bedroom suite (#11) that was not in the main building, but rather in the back of the hotel in a separate building. While the Internet photos featured a middle room with a couch and tv as the suite, we had no such thing. Our \"suite\" room was an outdoor patio. It was pleasant, but not what was advertised. As a result, the only TV was in one on the bedrooms. Had we been two couples instead of two people, this would have been borderline unacceptable. Speaking of bedrooms...the bedrooms were barely big enough to contain the bed. One of them had no windows - - just a French door that led to the kitchenette. The \"window\" was a door with a window in it that was blocked so you couldn't see the storeroom that it led to. This suite also is right next to the garbage dumpster. Nothing like being woken up by a garbage truck at the crack of dawn while you're on vacation to relax. And then having a non-working coffeemaker. (They have coffee in the patio outside the office, but sadly, no tropical fruits, just muffins and Washington State apples). Also, housekeeping forgot to clean our room one day (given that there are seven rooms, that seemed a bit absurd) and also left the doors unlocked two days. The safe for the room was at the bottom of a closet, making it near impossible to read the operating directions. Fortunately I'd used this type of safe before and knew the codes. One final minor thing: is it really necessary to hang up a Trip Advisor review of the room in the room? Geez. Also, the beach is a bit of a ways away and it was unswimmable the entire time we were there because of rough waters and high winds. Not their fault, but if you're going to Maui and want to hang out on the beach, you're going to have to drive 30-45 minutes each time you want to do it. On the other hand, Pa'ia is right on the road to Hana, has a couple of good restaurants (Pa'ia Fishmarket was awesome), and isn't nearly as traffic-y and touristy as other parts of the island. All that said, this is a nice funky place that's a nice alternative to the mega-hotels on the island.

The town of Paia is a funky place to visit before you head of too Hana, with neat little shops, great restaurants and has a unique vibe, all of its own.

As I drove up to the inn, parked and walked inside, there was a note saying something like :\"I have stepped away for a second, please call this number and I will be right back.\" I called that number and someone really did immediately show up. Tina welcomed my wife and me like she had known us for years. I have to say that these days, while checking into a resort, hotel or inn, the reception is all too often \"indifferent.\" After Tina greeted us and gave us a brief overview, she walked us to our suite. During check in, I asked her where I could go to watch the super bowl (of course her suggestion was right on). The funny thing was, a couple of minutes later, Tina was knocking on our door. She came by to remind my wife that they had private beach access and offered to show my wife where the access was in case she did not want to watch the super bowl. How often does that quality of service happen? After the game, we came back to the reception area and Tina had already departed (as she informed us she would) and Carly had taken over. Again, the same type of very warm welcome. She gladly walked us down the private access path to the beach....forget the west side of Maui, this beach just incredible...very soft sand, clear water and pretty empty. As Carly could tell, my wife and I wanted to take a walk on the beach. She invited us back to the lobby when we were finished for a glass of wine (of course we took her up on that offer). As we sat on the very comfortable sofa, sipping wine, talking to Carly, I remembered that I saw somewhere that one of the perks of staying at the Paia Inn was that there was some sort of free health club access. I asked Carly about this and she went to grab a pass but realized that they were out. No problem, she would print us a new one. She pulled out the laminate machine and preceded to carry it the front door of the lobby so we would not be affected by the small of the melting plastic as she laminated our guest pass. I know I am going into great detail but wanted to sincerely highlight the above and beyond approach both Carly and Tina take in their interactions with the guests at the inn. The suite had a full kitchen and the whole unit had been recently remodeled. There was every kitchen appliance needed and the kitchen was fully stocked with glasses and utensils. There was a very nice, extremely large private courtyard with beautiful vegetation, lawn, organic garden, picnic table, furniture and a fountain. Back to the inside. The beds were so comfortable and the bedding was of very high quality. We both had the best night sleep we had in a long time. The AC was also very welcome, although not very hot, most of the places on that side of the island (including Hana) do not have AC. The location could not be better. It is literally steps from one of the most beautiful beaches I have seen and right in the middle of down town Paia. I had never really spent any time there, but there are dozens of great, unique restaurants and shops and the people working there and and around town tend to not treat you like a tourist like \"those other\" areas of Maui do. I have always just driven through Paia on my way to Hana but never imagined that Paia in itself would be such a great destination. I have to say, based on the amenities, the comfort of the room, cleanliness, location and the incredible level of service, I can not think of a better place I have ever stayed. The whole purpose of our trip was to stay in Hana, but stay just one night near the airport to relax before heading out to Hana the next day. Needless to say the Paia Inn was by far and away the best part of our stay (and we stayed in a pretty nice place in Hana). Whle in Hana (our old favorate location), we kept wishing we were back at the Paia Inn. Of everything else I mentioned above, I just cannot properly put into words how relaxing the the Paia Inn is and how comfortable the entire staff makes you feel. My wife and I have been traveling for a long time and have stayed in some pretty nice places. Overall the Paia Inn is one of our favorite, if not our most favorite places we have ever stayed. We just booked a five night stay in September and are already counting the days. Before last week, I would never have thought that the town of Paia and the Paia Inn would be our # 1 destination in all of Hawaii.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cPretty Paia\u201d", "Author": "emaock", "ReviewID": "UR55660442", "Content": "We stayed at Paia Inn for our last night in Maui. It is a hip, cute, boutique hotel. We own an even smaller boutique hotel (6 rooms) in my home town in Virginia and I am very picky about hotels. I based my rating on this hotel comparing it to my own. (We own the Suites at 249 - - you can see it right here on TripAdvisor.) Carly greeted us and was extremely helpful! No, the staff isn't on duty 24/7, but if you want that, stay at the Holiday Inn. When you have such a small hotel it's hard to justify the cost of round the clock staff. The shampoo, soaps, and lotions were beautuful! I should have bought some when I was there. The location is the best and Baldwin beach was beautiful! The Paia Inn is not perfect, but it's well worth a stay if you want to be close to the airport or close to this charming little town. Here are my reasons for 4 dots instead of 5. Cleanliness: one towel in the room did have a big stain on it, I read about that in another rating and thought the management would have taken care of it. It's a pretty easy fix . . . Management: FYI - it was a hand towel. Rooms: The beautiful silk curtains at the entrance to our room had a big stain on it also. Again an easy fix. Sleep quality: There was another guest, above our room that was doing laps at about 7:30 - 8:00 am . . . and our room, was right next to a storage closet full of boogie boards, snorkeling equip., etc that was for the use of all hotel guests. Actually our headboard was against the wall that was shared with the equipment room and whenever a guest decided to get out some equipment, we could hear it banging against the wall . . . at 8:00 in the morning.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Koh Samui", "Title": "\u201c\"SPECIAL PLACE\"\u201d", "Author": "David D", "ReviewID": "UR54974976", "Content": "My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at this wonderful boutique hotel last November.

We were originally to stay two, but it was such a great place that we extended our stay by an extra night. We were greeted by very helpful staff who offered us a welcome glass of wine after our very long flight to Maui. The service continued to be spectacular during the entire stay. The front desk staff were incredibly helpful, often helping us plan our day's activities and pointing out not-to-be-missed spots. After spending a day out and about, we often talked of returning \"home\", by which we meant the Inn. We stayed in a junior suite, and while the bedroom itself was pretty small, it was more than enough space. The location of the inn had its plusses (right in the heart of Paia and a quick walk to the beach down a private access path) and minuses (we were woken up early by street noise one morning). The complimentary breakfast of fresh pastries, coffee, juice, and fruit each day (delivered from the excellent coffee shop across the street) was just what we needed to start our day. The hotel also provided beach chairs, boogie boards, and snorkeling gear if needed. After we left Paia, we spent four nights in a high-end resort in Ka'anapali. After spending a night or two in the touristy Ka'anapali, we really missed the laid-back atmosphere of Paia and the Paia Inn. The Paia Inn felt like home to us, and we missed that feeling the last four nights of our trip.

There is a private path that leads to the beach from the Inn - they provide chairs, towels, beach equipment, etc. Just a note - the waves in North Maui can be ROUGH, so be careful. The town of Paia is a nice little town with a strong surfing / laid back feel to it. Some nice restaurants, shops, etc - all within easy walking distance of the Paia Inn. Our favorite attraction was Ho'okipa beach, where you can see people surfing the biggest waves I've ever seen. It's about a 2-3 mile drive from the Paia Inn. The inn provides free parking which is also a great bonus. Overall, if you're going to Paia for surfing, hitting the road to Hana, or just want to check out a town that's a little different from much of the rest of Maui, then you can't go wrong staying at the Paia Inn.

We got engaged down the road at one of the numerous nearby beautiful sights, Twin Falls, and the owner gave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate.

The Inn was more like a B&B (W/O the breakfast) than a hotel. Our room had a covered patio, which we enjoyed tremendously. Our bathroom was outside under the covered patio/porch, and at first we wasn't sure about that, however, we immediately fould that we liked that. The South shore was so touristy and crowed, we were glad we stayed on the North Shore in Paia. My wife and I have traveled to all 50 states and we found the staff at the Paia Inn to be as friendly as any we have experienced. There were two things about Paia Inn that potential guest should be aware of. The noise level between the rooms(some of the worst we've experienced), could really be a problem if your neighbors were on a different schedule that you. Secondly, the Paia Inn has limited access to the Beach. There is a small walkway from the Inn, across private property, to the Beach and there is no access before 8AM or after 7PM. Yes, you can walk down the highway for a distance and get to the beach, but who wants to do that on a regular basis. We went to Hawaii as much for the Beach as anything, so we were somewhat disappointed we couldn't do sunrise or sunset strolls close to our room. People should also know that the North Shore is where the big waves are. That means few people(compared to the South Shore) go here to swim. The waves are so big and undertow so strong, swimming could be dangerous. The up side though, is you feel you have the beaches to yourself. When we checked-in at the Inn and were told of the limited beach access, I was really aggrivated. I believe the Paia Inn should disclose this fact, after all, people stay in beachside accomidations because they want access to the beach . I understand why they don't, if my wife and I had read this fact on their website, we probably would have stayed somewhere else. Believe me, I'm not trying to be negative here, I just believe people need to know exactly what they are getting. That being said, I'm still glad we stayed at the Paia Inn. These sacrafices were still better for us than staying in the large, crowed and touristy resorts. \"Rubbing elbows\" in Paia with the locals, instead on all tourist at the big resorts, gave us a good idea what it would be like to live in Hawaii. In closing, we really enjoyed our stay. The staff and accomidations were great and we do reccomend Paia Inn. It would definately be a top consideration if we were to go to Maui again.", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cOpen the gate and enter a haven of comfort, right in the middle of Paia.\u201d", "Author": "QueenPalmyra", "ReviewID": "UR49794142", "Content": "You enter the parking lot first, having noticed the sign Paia Inn, but can't imagine this might be it -- this sweet little hotel friends keep telling you about.

Our friends rented the ocean front unit which was also great and had a big yard that accessed the ocean. We debated sharing our unit with the other family, we are glad we didn't. It could have worked but each has only one bathroom and our bedrooms are small and close together. Having the 2 units to go back and forth was perfect. We cooked several meals of fresh fish and vegggies thanks to the very close natural food store which is wonderfully stocked and carries a variety of high grade fish. We stayed at the Sheraton Black Rock earlier in our stay and coming here was a wonderful change from the crowds and commercial feel of Kaanapali. Our boys did mourn the loss of a pool but have thoroughly enjoyed nearby Baldwin Beach and adventures on the road to Hana (just short of 2 hr drive w/o stops.) Nearby shops are very cute and the Flatbread Pizza Co. next door has great salads, pizza and local beer. Extras like the fresh coffee and muffins delivered each day, use of beach gear and boogies boards, in room first aid kits and bug repellent plus wonderful bath products were nice bonuses. All staff were very friendly and helpful There is a clear commitment to sustainability and the environment which is most appreciated. Caveats--There is not daily housekeeping, though they gladly give fresh towels upon request. Depending on your taste, a night or two here may be enough.

Coffee, tea, etc. and muffins, provided by the coffee shop across the street, are available for free. A bowl of fruit is also available in the lobby. They offered me a glass of wine (white). The main building houses the lobby downstairs and 5 rooms upstairs. There are also some cottages. My room, for 1 person I got the smallest, was small but comfortable. The bed was very comfortable.

The 1st beach is directly accessible by the public from the parking lot of a youth activity center with a skateboard park. The 3rd beach is directly accessible by the public from Baldwin park. The middle beach not directly accessible from the main road, but is reached from one of the other beaches. Due to its relative isolation, the 2nd beach is a nude beach. Paia is located on the north-central coast, 10-15 minutes from the airport. Nothing on the island is very far away (within a couple hours), and the location provides an excellent opportunity to get a jump start on the traffic to Hana or Haleakala.

Without any trouble at all, you'll reach mile 9 (two miles from the Inn) and the amazing hidden cove on your left. What a view - and an incredible place to stop and contemplate the meaning of life. Back at the Inn, take an outside shower, get dressed and walk across the street for a wonderful muffin and great coffee.

If you want to head into town, go everywhere - but don't miss the fish tacos at the fish market or the gelato from the mysterious and beautiful dark haired lady with blue eyes (next to the Inn's main office).

You will not be making a wrong decision by choosing this accommodation. If you do get a room - or the room with the veranda, please start counting the minutes until you get there. All the anticipation in the world is worth it - you'll love the Inn, the people, the town, and every little adventure you get yourself into. Don't be surprised if you find yourself falling in love with everyone and everything. I know I did. p.s. Mama's Fish House (if you just have to go) has two bars and apps. for a fraction of the cost of the meal. Check it out and drink an incredible Maui Tai (complete with unbrellas!) or two.

Before our trip, I spent hours reviewing everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments. I was a bit obsessive, but it paid off. We loved every second of Maui and Paia Inn! I am very picky when it comes to hotels and will shell out a little extra money to insure that my husband and I are comfortable wherever we stay. When we decided to travel to Maui our main goal was to have the experience of a lifetime and to relax. Paia Inn was perfect, simply romantic, just what we wanted and needed. Paia is true Maui or its laid back cousin! As soon as we arrived; there were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no worries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We booked one of the suites for a three night stay, and I will admit, I wondered if I was making a good call going off the beaten path. Even after such rave reviews and booking our stay, I almost chickened out, twice! Like I said, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m picky. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad I trusted my instincts. Our three nights in Paia, set the tone for our entire trip. We just loved Michael (the owner) and the Paia Inn staff. When do you ever get to say that about a hotel? They were all so helpful, welcoming, and the nicest people ever. One evening my husband went to the front desk to borrow their wine bottle opener and after several minutes I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wondering, where is this guy with the wine already? Turns out, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outside talking to Michael. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharing stories about our trip and getting suggestions for the rest of our Maui adventure, ha! I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say enough about the people or the suite! The website doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do this place justice, because the suites are super cool. The room we were in had a luxurious outdoor shower for the adventurous and an indoor shower for the rest of us! The suite felt like our little home away from home. It was peaceful and most of all quiet. The beach is nearby, too, so you could walk down the private pathway, and enjoy a nice stroll on the beach. One of the reasons I chose Paia Inn was because of its proximity to so many great restaurants. Flatbreads, Moana Caf\u00c3\u00a9, and Paia Fish Market all wonderful! After a trip to Hana, sunrise atop Haleakala, or a day at Ka'anapali Beach (yes, we got around) it was always nice to travel back to the North Shore, walk to a restaurant, and just relax and unwind. I wish we had more time to try the other restaurants nearby. I was so sad to leave after our third night! For the rest of our trip we stayed at the Four Seasons at Wailea, and we loved it there, too! However, Paia Inn holds a special place in our hearts and we wish Michael, his family, and staff the best!

We stayed in Room 2 from August 28-31 and had an absolutely wonderful experience. It is easy to see why everyone raves about the hotel. Our room had a comfy queen bed with 4 pillows (two firm, two soft) and a small ensuite bathroom. We booked the room back in April and were pleasantly surprised to find that it was written up in the New York Times travel section the following month! We were so excited because we scored a gem! Yes, it is expensive for the price....I believe each night came to $233 with tax....but it was soooo worth it! Our room was not ready when we arrived...apparently they were having an issue with housekeeping and our 3:00 pm check-in was delayed until 4:30. Nonetheless, we spent the time walking around the cute little town of Paia. When we returned, we were greeted warmly by Janelle who offered us a glass of wine or local brew. She then showed us the bath to the beach (about a three-minute walk down a tropical bath between some residences) and set us up with a beach bag with towels for our stay. Everything in the hotel is considered....free wi-fi and use of a computer/printer in the family room, umbrellas for tropical showers, chairs and snorkeling equipment for the beach, and complimentary muffins and coffee in the morning on the patio. The pastries came from Anthony's Coffee Shop across the street -- how do these people not get fat? The muffins and scones were amazing! There are travel books to take with you on your excursions and board games to play during downtime. Each room had a plasma TV and iPort to listen to your favorite tunes. I was worried that the rooms would be a bit noisy and we would hear our neighbors in the other four rooms on our floor, but it was relatively quiet. Our room overlooked the Hana Highway, which was a little noisy in the evening and in the morning with truck traffic, but the hotel provides ear plugs in case you need them! By the way, the bathroom was somewhat small but the shower was decent and I LOVED the bath products that we were given. When the housekeeping failed to restock them on Day 2, Janelle was kind enough to hand us a few days' worth of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion! We loved them so much, we bought a few to take home! I can't forget to mention how wonderful Tina and Nina were as well as Janelle! It's nice to be greeted by the staff in the morning or when you come home after a long day of touring Maui! The only drawbacks were that the room was not as clean as it could have been when we arrived (stained facecloths and food leftover from the previous guests in our mini-fridge) and the hotel floor is kept very warm in the evening. I apologize for touching the thermostat and freezing my neighbors, but trying to fall asleep when the room was close to 80 degrees was quite impossible! If you are looking for a great place to eat, may we recommend two superb restaurants in walking distance. The first is Flatbread Company, which is basically in the same building as the hotel...right around the corner from the entrance. The food here is fresh, fresh, fresh and is made with as many local organic ingredients as possible. We actually ate here two nights, splitting a fresh salad and a flatbread pizza, which is perfect for two. The best part is that the staff (who are extremely friendly) allow you to split the type of flatbread -- we enjoyed the buffalo chicken on one side of the flatbread and eggplant parmesan (yes!) on the other side. Both were perfect! Check out www.flatbreadcompany.com. We also loved the Paia Fish Market, right up the block. The food here is amazingly delicious and fresh. My boyfriend enjoyed a plate of Mahi fish & chips (delicious!) and I had an \"Obama Burger\" which was made with fresh ono and served with wasabi butter and coleslaw. Heaven! Check them out at www.paiafishmarket.com. According to everyone we met, this was such a better bargain that the expensive Mama's Fish House up the road. What you sacrifice in the view (no ocean vista....more like a picnic) you make up for in service and quality. Add a local beer to your meal to make it even more appetizing! (But skip dessert and head to Ono Gelato down the street.....truly wonderful!) We will definitely be back to the Paia Inn.....it's one of our favorite places to stay!", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Small Town Feel of Paia\u201d", "Author": "RiverPlace4", "ReviewID": "UR39817854", "Content": "We loved the little town of Paia and were very pleased with the Paia Inn Hotel.

Paia was very conveniently located to the airport which reduced any further travel time. We were able to eat lunch and enjoy the beach within walking distance of the hotel. I loved this beach and it may have been one of my favorites on the entire trip. It was great for boogie boarding (Paia Inn provides boards) and splashing in the waves. At low tide there were small pools near the lava rocks were small fish and crabs were hanging out. The girls loved checking this out! The beach was not crowded at all and this was quite nice when compared to some of the other more tourist beaches in front of large hotels. We found several wonderful restaurants, quaint shops and a local grocery store. Another reason to stay the night in Paia is that it is located at the beginning of the Hana Hwy. and helped reduce some of the travel time for us in driving to Hana.

I should preface this by saying that I have stayed at a number of fantastic hotels on Maui....from the Kea Lani, The Ritz Carlton, The Marriott Wailea (well, not so fantastic!), the Grand Wailea and I even got married at the Four Seasons. But of these hotels, the one I most look forward to returning to is the Paia Inn which is absolutely charming From the moment you walk into the Paia Inn, you are greeted by a fantastic staff who greet you like you were an old friend. The staff was so nice that you actually wanted to take them to dinner (I mean that). Thank you Nina and Tina! They couldn't have been more helpful. And the owners are around a lot. I watched one guest try to tip the cooly dressed \"bellman,\" only to discover that the bellman was actually the owner (no, he wouldn't take the tip!). The hotel rooms are very comfortable, but not extremely large, but they are really well appointed with iPhone docks, large plasma TV's, and had extremely comfortable beds with great linens. All the rooms had rather cool art on the walls, all original and the furnishings throughout the hotel help give it a distinctive feel. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. I was able to try a few different rooms as the hotel was sold out on two of the nights I was there, so I had to check out of the hotel before I came back, so I ended up staying both in upstairs rooms and also in one of the one bedroom suites along the side of the hotel that had a very handy kitchen (there is a well stocked market a half a block away). The hotel has a private pathway to the beach, so from your room to the beach is less than a one minute walk which is great for someone like me who always forgets something in the room which I don't realize until I get to the beach! The hotel is nestled right in the heart in the charming town of Paia which is filled with great little stores and restaurants and coffee houses. You can walk next door to Flatbread restaurant for a meal (really great pizza!) or go to the Paia Fish Market (across the street), or go to Jacques for sushi and a good bar scene, or walk directly across the street to Anthony's coffee (which has to be my favorite coffee houses anywhere and they serve a great breakfast and lunch). And even though the Paia Inn serves complimentary coffee and muffins from Anthony's on the hotel patio every morning, I also loved hanging out at Anthony's some mornings for coffee as it offers great people watching. The town buzzes with tourists by day, but in the mornings and again in the evenings, it reverts much more to an old town feel but with a really interesting locals mix. Two Thanksgivings ago I was in Maui and ended up passing through Paia, where I caught Willie Nelson playing a full set at a local Paia honky tonk bar, which he is said (??) to own a piece of (I forget the name of the bar/club but it's still there, right next to Jacques). And just ten minutes or so up the road from Paia is Mama's Fish House Restaurant, where we seem to end up on most trips.... It's touristy, but the food is always excellent.

We arent ones for big resorts, where folks wait on you hand and foot, and you spend most of your time on campus. Instead, we like to venture out and explore.

And have the deli next door pack you a nice picnic lunch). Its at the base of Mount Haleakala (and only crazy people visit Maui without driving up the 10,000 foot volcano). Its a short hop to stunning Iao Valley, and not too far from the aquarium, snorkel trip marina, and Kihei resort area. However, its a bit of a haul over to the Lahaina resort area (gorgeous drive, though). As for Paia Inn itself, we LOVED it. Very hip atmosphere, artwork, and decor. Squeaky clean. Ultra-comfy bed. Friendly, helpful staff. Nice quiet beach out back; but be aware its on the windward side of the isle, okay for swimming but not a placid lagoon-like, snorkel-friendly beach like those on the other side.

This little inn in this little town won our hearts over, hands down. What may be surprising is that competition to win our favor is the Ritz on the west side of Maui and the Outrigger on Waikiki Beach. The price at the Ritz was more than double the Paia Inn, and yet the Paia delivered better service and a much more welcoming ambiance. When we arrived, we were shown to our room and immediately were reminded of the quaint offbeat hotels that we stayed at during our honeymoon trip to Italy many years ago because the building is somewhat narrow but the space is well used. On the second floor, there is an open area with comfy charis, IPod dock (in our room too!), a computer desk with free computer access, guidebooks and games free for borrowing, and interesting art. The best part is that when someone else is coming to/from their rooms, you are likely to strike up a conversation. The same goes for the welcoming area at reception area and the courtyard where evening wine and morning coffee are offered gratis. We met a few interesting people there which only makes the experience richer. Our room was all that we needed in a hotel room. It struck me as odd that there is a large flat screen t.v. because I couldn't imagine that someone would want to watch t.v. but my husband saw it differently and was grateful to have something to watch while I got ready to go to the beach/go to dinner, etc. There is a wonderful coffee shop across the street which we didn't discover until we were on the way out of town (we stayed only 2 days). It is the shop that supplies the Inn with the morning goodies in the courtyard as part of your stay at the Inn. The scones, muffins, and coffee were all delicious. The stock was not plentiful (hint) and we were conscious at not eat more than one small scone lest someone else awaken hungry. We had plenty of food choices--tapas menu at a Mediterranean restaurant, fish market, etc, but we opted both nights to eat at Jacques. The first time was by luck of the draw; the second time was by demand. Along with very generous portions, they offered something I had not found for a very long time---squid in ink sauce. yum! The biking excursion down the mountain began and ended in Paia, so it was awfully convenient to stay at the Inn when we had to crawl out of bed to meet the others at the biking place at 3 a.m. (sunrise watching at the crater required us to awaken this early). Although we had plenty to keep us entertained (including down time at the beach), if you plan to stay for more than 2-3 days, I recommend renting a car. This way, you can go about the island as you please and return each day to this wonderful gem in the Pacific. p.s. To give a balanced and fair review, I have to mention the only noteworthy bummer I could recall and that was beach access (from the Inn to the beach is a path that leads you past the cottage that is in between the Inn and the beach, so there is no ocean view from the hotel). It is limited to certain hours. Sure put a damper on our desire to sit on the beach and watch the sun rise :(", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable!!\u201d", "Author": "PaigeRichey", "ReviewID": "UR32635472", "Content": "We stayed here as one stopping point on our honeymoon.

We travel annually to Maui and generally stay at the Four Seasons Resort or, if we feel like making the drive, the Hotel Hana-Maui. We wanted to get a different feel for the island, and we really enjoy spending one of our days on the island shopping, eating, and hanging out in Paia, so we thought staying there before moving on to the Four Seasons would be a nice way to break up the trip. We stayed at the Paia Inn Hotel for five days. It was an absolutely wonderful time. We booked the larger of the rooms available, and that was a good idea considering the number of bags we had. Some rooms are smaller than others so if you have a lot of bags, or require a lot of space, make sure to book the suite or a larger room. Everything about our room was great - the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable - perfect for my taste (not too soft or too hard). Small bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel are provided and replenished throughout your stay. The products are excellent. There is no elevator, and since the property feels like you are staying in a B&B, one has to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the rooms. Not a problem for us, but something to consider if you don't like stairs or have a lot of luggage. The lobby is a great spot to relax and gather. There is a large LCD television with a rolling montage of photos of the property and \"Island\" music playing in the courtyard and in the lobby. The staff is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable of the area and things to do and places to eat. Two restaurants I recommend are the Paia Fish Market, across the street, and Flatbread Pizza Company, just two doors down. There is a stocked mini-bar in every room, scones, tea, and coffee provided in the courtyard every morning by Anthony's Coffee House (which is just across the street and also provides room service), and, as I mention above, great restaurants nearby and a fabulous natural grocery store a block away (Mana Foods). A couple of days we went to the grocery store and got some things to eat in the tree and umbrella-shaded courtyard of the hotel. Wonderful. Paia Inn Hotel also offers private access to a beach just behind the property. They have beach chairs for use and a shed that has body boards and other beach-related paraphernalia for use. One can also store a surfboard or paddle board in the shed for safe-keeping. Speaking of safe, this property is safe and secure and we felt very much at home here. Each guest room has a parking space right on property and there is a surf shop with an excellent instructor (Tom) right next door. Other things of note about the property - hardwood floors throughout, excellent and prompt housekeeping, complimentary wireless access throughout the property, a computer, printer, and fax machine with Skype set-up; iHome in each room and an upstairs \"living area\" with magazines, travel guides, a business center, and music playing on a separate iHome system from an iPod. Also provided is a weekly rundown sheet of daily activities in Paia at surrounding galleries, shops, and nightclubs so that guests can get out and explore the town and all that it offers by the locals. And while they don't have a fitness center on-site, they do have a relationship with a gym nearby for those needing such facilities. The front desk is staffed until 10 PM, but a manager lives on property and any requests can be immediately attended to. As an example of the lengths the front desk will go to to assist its guests, we had a foot injury while surfing one morning. The staff called a convenient care facility, called another doctor, went to a store to purchase medical supplies, and followed-up with us later that day to insure that we were ok and that we did not need further medical attention. Definitely above and beyond the call of desk duty, particularly for something that happened off property through no fault or involvement of the Paia Inn Hotel. I would highly recommend Paia Inn Hotel to anyone looking to stay at a new, urbane, hip property with attention to details, friendly and young staff, and one who is looking for an experience that allows you to \"live with the locals\", as one can in Paia. It's an especially lovely place for solo travelers and couples of all ages.

Paia itself has a chilled surfer vibe to it with some great restaurants and bars. Having stayed in Wailea before I can say that Paia is the best town on the island and is not just tourist orientated. Its also brilliantly located for watersports - I was there for kitesurfing and surfing - the hotel can recommend some great instructors for both of those. The only slight issue I would highlight is that the cheaper rooms are on the front of the building which is right in the middle of the town. The location is a plus point for me as it means you are really close to restaurants etc. but light sleepers would be better off going for one of the more expensive rooms which are set back from the road and would be totally sheltered form any noise.

Our stay at the Paia Inn surpassed all previous trips in terms of rest, relaxation, and fun. We felt we were in the \"real\" Hawaii, not a corporate idea of what a tourist to Maui would desire. The inn is on the main road in Paia, a super cute town on the windy side of the island. All of the staff were friendly and helpful, showing us to the beach, getting extra towels, and replacing a lightbulb. We stayed in room 6, a suite with a kitchen and sitting room which was spacious and comfortable. My ONLY suggestion is more towel racks (to save towels that don't need laundering) and lots of hooks for bathing suits and rain jackets. The decor is chic, like how your hip, world-trotting friend would decorate her cottage by the ocean. They have chairs, mats, and boogie boards for guests to use, and tea and coffee are available in the lobby most of the day. Virtually steps away are many good restaurants to choose from: Paia Fish Market (I daresay we liked it as much as Mama's Fish House!), Flatbread, Mambo Cafe, Moana Cafe and Bakery (don't get too lazy to walk the extra block to get there), OnoGelato (once a day, just like in Italy) and Anthony's (open at 6am for those up early on mainland time). Also close by is Mana Foods, a cool supermarket with lots of organic fruits and veg, as well as some tasty looking prepared items. Our room had two wall AC units, but we never used them, the ceiling fans were perfect. The kitchen was equipped with dishes, pots, pans, etc in case one wanted to cook. Our bed was super comfy after our days of snorkeling, swimming, and hiking. If your idea of a good time in Hawaii does not involve standing in lines, swimming up to a pool bar, paying for a lawn chair on the beach while people walk by to sell you drinks, then consider the Paia Inn. The most fun thing we did was take a stand up paddle board lesson with Maria Souza. Her pamphlet is at the hotel and the staff endorsed her enthusiastically. She called us right back to schedule and called again before the lesson to make sure we wanted to do it even though it was raining on and off. We warmed up on the beach, then went out on the boards in a protected cove about 5 minutes from the Inn. My husband and I both got it: we were standing on the boards, paddling and turning. Maria is so passionate about the ocean and teaching people how to get out there. It was an inspiration to meet her and I would encourage Everyone going to Maui to take a paddleboarding or surfing lesson with her.

As far as I can tell, most near-ocean real estate is taken up by the big resorts, so the 'boutique' hotel revolution hasn't been able to exist much on Maui. Enter Paia Inn! The hotel and rooms are tiny (don't come here expecting expansive suites!), but almost every detail has been thoughtfully designed and executed. The rooms are tranquil, stylish, and comfortable. The staff is great! There's not a lot of room for parking, so cars have to double up and then the staff moves the cars around when someone needs access. Constant valet service! Not to mention the gracious answers to all our questions and helpful recommendations. Everyone was wonderfully hip and casual, but perfectly professional at all times - We felt like we'd been invited to stay in the guest quarters of the most 'with it' friends-of-friends on the island! Honestly, Paia was the most fun of our whole trip. Forget Whaler's Village and the other malls, the town of Paia has the best shops and restaurants and galleries around, plus it feels like a real community where residents and tourists mix happily - and, I assume, profitably. The concentration of good, interesting, and affordable places to eat in Paia has to be the best on the island. The gelato place a couple doors down is fantastic too! No, Paia Inn is not right on the sand, but a 30 second walk down a lovely private path will take you to beautiful beaches with lots of great surf. We loved it. I only had two teensy complaints: The room needed a wastebasket in addition to the tiny one in the bathroom; and there was a very bright streetlamp right outside our window that the blinds couldn't eliminate. I suspect only our room (rm 3) had the streetlamp problem, though. Both not a big deal, and easily fixed. Overall, we had a blast at the Paia Inn, and in Paia in general.

The courtyard has many beautiful accents including a water feature and some sculptural pieces.

I called the Paia Inn to make reservations and spoke to Nina, who was very friendly and gave me suggestions about Hana. Even though they only have 5 rooms in the main building (they also have a couple of cottages), they had a generous cancellation policy (simply 24 hours notice). Upon arrival we were greeted with glasses of white wine and shown to our room. The room is on the small side but very tastefully decorated. We don't mind a small room because we usually spend most of the time out - afterall we're on vacation! The location is superb - it was very centrally located for the places that we went - Lahaina for one evening for dinner at Mala Ocean Tavern (yum!) and a show at Warren & Annabelle's (which I HIGHLY recommend), Maalaea Harbor for a sailing/snorkeling trip to Molokini on Trinity, and Haleakala National Park.

We took her suggestion and it was amazing! The drive is so gorgeous and we saw lots of rainbows. Thanks for the suggestion! The beach is beautiful. We went every day - there is a 2-minute walk on a private path to the beach, which is not on the tourist track. Twice we went in the morning and we were the only ones there!

The rooms were very nice: comfortable beds with ample storage for luggage underneath, modern fixtures, air conditioning, proper insulation from exterior noise, nice electronics, etc. The coffee and pastries provided by the coffee shop across the street were a great touch.

The Paia Inn embodies what is so wonderful about this town - it's very welcoming (the owners and staff are great), low-key and just plain COOL. Each room comes with its own pet goldfish, which is cute. The decor is modern and beachy (the owners are interior designers). The rooms have an iHome in which you can plug in your iPod or iPhone for music, as well as flat screen TVs. The rooms are small, however, so once you've got suitcases open on the floor it can be a little tricky to move around, but since the town and beach are so delightful, we weren't spending time in the room outside of sleeping and showering. Some of the rooms have the sink inside the bedroom (instead of the bathroom), so if this is something you don't like, make sure to try and get a different room (Room #1 does not have this problem). The only other \"funky\" aspect is the parking situation. The inn has 5 rooms, but only three parking stalls, so tandem parking is used to accommodate the additional vehicles. If your car is blocking another guest, you'll need to leave your keys at the front desk so your car can be moved if needed.

While having a lovely lunch in the lovely town of Paia, we engaged a local lady at a table next to ours in conversation and she recommended the Inn. While the prices are higher than we usually like to pay, we decided to go for it when realized it was located right in the heart of the town of Paia within walking distance to everything, including the beach. They have their own private beach access, despite not being directly on the beach. The location was key here - particularly because my boyfriend was still using a cane after ankle fusion surgery, so keeping walking distances minimal was very important. As parking in the town can be difficult and the traffic congested, it was the deciding factor. We were really pleased with the accommodations, which although small, are very comfortable and well considered. The sheets and beds are GREAT! And we slept like babies. In the morning, there was coffee, tea and pastries from a breakfast place across the street \"Anthony's\". They were delicious and made getting going in the morning a lot easier. We could skip a larger breakfast and hold out for a early lunch (which I'm sure saved us some $$ in the long run). We were a little bit concerned about noise the first night, as that afternoon there was a lot of noise from the restaurant under the Inn, but our concerns were unfounded, as each night when we turned in early, all was quiet. There is some noise from the street first thing in the morning, but the town seems to stop moving at 8:30pm every night. The staff were very accommodating and even let me use the laundry inside the Inn when the outdoor dryer seemed to be taking too long. If I have any complaints, the only one would be that the water in the shower was not sufficiently hot despite turning it up all the way.
