Although in the same room, the cot was placed in a concealed area of the room, which allowed us to stay watching TV or reading in bed without disturbing the little one. The staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly for giving us local information. One regret is that we were really hoping to eat in what looked like a fabulous restaurant, with very dedicated cooks; but it was closed on Sundays and Mondays. Indeed in the restaurant/breakfast room they had a very good stockpile of wines, and most of all a very good variety of Single Malts!

Breakfast was a nice display of fruits and meats though I have seen better at the AC hotels in town. Where my great concern lies is in the quality of the materials used and the color selection. All white and beige looks great for a few months but then everything shows up on it and starts to look tacky. The white floors had several dark streaks on it, not dirt as much as marks from shoes and furniture. The room furniture is covered in mirrors and the lower corner of the sink cabinet had a broken piece of mirror missing. I was in two different rooms during this stay and both rooms had dark stains on the beige carpet under the bed. The cabinet door for the bar area you could push open but could not close, the wireless internet did not work in my room the two days I was there, one day it was for all floors the second day I was relocated to a room on the second floor where it worked.

The hotel was only 4 blocks from the main area and great shopping. We got lost of course trying to find the hotel on the way back, and we finally found it about 2 hrs later, when we arrived back the room was ready and our bags were in the room already (GREAT SERVICE). Now mind you the hotel has only been opened at this time about 3 months which we did not know, they have a great breakfast included in the price (which I would take it) \"YUMMY\" they also have an espresso bar in the lobby. All I can say if you are looking for Great service not so far out of the way location (a train ride from major locations) sound proof rooms and super clean hotel \"THIS IS THE PLACE\"!!!!!!", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLoved, loved loved it!\u201d", "Author": "travelgeek83", "ReviewID": "UR105913635", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying in this hotel in April for 4 nights. I cannot complement it enough. From the minute we checked in to the minute we left I have no complaints. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was amazing, and contrary to other reports we had no problems with cleanliness. The bed, bath, leather sofa for relaxing, shower, slippers and dressing gowns and two televisions all contributed to a perfect room. Never had a problem with the free wi-fi, was excellent knowing it was there to research things to do in the city. Everything is electronic but once you get the hang of this it is very easy and convenient to operate. Usually around 4pm we would venture up to the rooftop terrace for a swim in the sun. Having it to ourselves was simply perfection. I would not hesitate in returning to this hotel in the future.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel - however some teething problems!\u201d", "Author": "zr1975", "ReviewID": "UR104366027", "Content": "I recently stayed at The Mirror hotel, Barcelona. Upon arrival - the hotel seemed amazing. In brilliant white & mirrors everywhere, it certainly stood out! Nothing was really explained upon check in... no mention of the breakfast times, internet usage etc. I assumed I would find all this in the rooms, and there was nothing there either (as I regular business traveller as myself - you would normally expect to see a hotel pack advising on the amenities). This had just a basic envelope pack consisting of hotel stationary only. Upon gaining access to my room, it became apparent quite quickly that there was an issue with the electrics in my room. I put the hotel card in to activate the room lights and they would remain on for about 5-10 seconds only then go out! I went down to reception & they said to call the chambermaid! The maid came up and re set the switch in the power unit in my room. It was good to go for a few minutes then the same happened again! I wanted to go out for a meal as by this time it was around 8.30pm, so I went out and hoped it would be resolved on my return. Once I returned there was still no electrics. I did become frustrated by now as the room for the 4 nights cost in excess of GBP 550.00, so to be honest I didnt feel I was getting value for money, plus I was tired and just wanted to shower and sleep (by now it was 11pm on night 1!!). The lady (the same one who asked me to call the chambermaid) on reception came up with me this time after she re set my actual room card. Still it didnt work and still I had the same \"not bothered\" attitude. She actually told me to worry about it in the morning! That night (as funny as it sounds), I washed my face with the light from my mobile phone! Comical really (or should I say it would of been had I of not been paying for this hotel room!!)... The next morning came and I went down to reception to try to resolves this issue - they assured me by the time I got back to my room that afternoon that the electrical issue would be resolved. At 4pm still NO electricity. I was fuming by now as I had been back and forth trying to resolve it and to no avail. The hotel Manager finally agreed to change my room (she referred to it as an upgrade) - however, it wasn't an upgrade at all. I was moved to the room next door which was only a standard double. Finally I had some electricity, so I wasnt too fussed about the room size at this point! The rooms itself are great in theory - very art deco... not really the place for a first romantic weekend away! - The toliet doors are see-through and face opposite the bed! Its basically all open planned - with the sink as you walk in the room (and not in the toilet itself). The bathroom is separate as is the tpolet and then the sink unit as I mentioned. The internet was another thing which crashed often and no information is given on this. I had to actually go to reception to request the password. It was things like this that were niggly and didn't add to a great experience. The breakfast service was interesting - just one lady covering the restaurant. She didnt really speak English (but then again, her English was much better than my Spanish!)... they could of done with an extra person in there to assist her. She wasnt attentive as she was running around to all tables. Not sure I would go there again. I think it was ok... but I wouldnt rush to visit again. Coming from a Customer Service background myself, I know what exceptional service entails and I have to say this fell far below that... issue resolution is not their strong point.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cModern, well located design hotel - with a few drawbacks\u201d", "Author": "Dominika978", "ReviewID": "UR104247944", "Content": "We were impressed by the design. Everything is white (both in the common area and the room), and there are mirrors everywhere which gives an illusion of more space than there actually is. Staff was friendly and helpful, but laid-back, which I personally think is a good thing. We did not eat at the restaurant, but the place was packed thursday and friday evening, so it\u00b4s apparently very popular. When we entered the room, the first thing that hit us was \"wow, this is cool\". Huge (and very comfortable) bed, a flat screen tv in front of the bed and enough space to relax after a long day of walking around the city. There is a flat screen in the toilet too, which I thought was unnecessary. The toilet and the shower/tub are separate. Doors to toilet and shower are see through glass. That and the mirrors everywhere don\u00b4t really leave you ANY privacy. Because of that I would not recommend sharing a room if you\u00b4re traveling with someone you\u00b4re not 100% comfortable with. There are light switches/buttons on the wall, and on each side of the bed. You can choose to turn on/off the light in the entire room, or just parts of it. The room could have been cleaner, especially the tub, but it was better after the second day. The downside of the room is the shower. If you\u00b4re not careful, water leaks through the glass wall and on to the floor. The entire floor ended up flooded. The water temperature changed from warm to very hot many times during the shower (every day), which was weird. On day 3 the toilet started constantly flushing. We told the staff, and they fixed it, but it was the same the day after. Free WiFi worked fine. The flat screen is no use if you don\u00b4t understand spanish. No satellite, and not possible to rent movies. This it the first hotel I\u00b4ve been to that has a really good make up mirror with the right lighting. Bathroom amenities were ok, but not replaced when used. And we did not get any hand soap the entire stay, and had to use the shower gel. All in all a good hotel. Great design, good and central location in quiet neighborhood, nice staff and comfortable sleep. If it was not for the shower/toilet issues, I would rate this as an excellent hotel.

First impressions not great. First front desk staff we encountered ignored us and we had to wait for someone else to help. There was a broken plastic step at front desk which was covered up by dirty rug. Considering this hotel just opened does not bode well for future. Room was spacious and had ample toiletries, although these were not always replenished. Glass doors on bathroom and shower room may be a problem for some. Bathrobes and slippers were welcome after hours of walking around city. Mirrors everywhere and lots of White padding on Walls. Nice design feature but not practical. The whiteness of the room was an issue. Already there was staining to the floors and Walls. Free wifi was good. Rooftop terrace and pool was tiny. 4 loungers and a couple of seats. Great if you get it to yourself - we enjoyed spending an hour relaxing after our day before heading out for dinner. The sauna wasn't opened yet. As others have mentioned cleaning was a bit hit and miss. First couple of days fine. Dirty bathmat which the cleaner had used to clean shower cubicle left on floor, towels and soap taken away and not replaced, bathrobes taken and not replaced. Expect bette from a new hotel billing itself as 4 star. Being a new hotel still issues with electricity and wifi. Electricity cut out a few times during our visit. Staff not too good at keeping us updated with what was happening. Chose this hotel based on it's Eco status. Except for solar panels helping with water heating, not too sure what else there is. No recycling in room, unfinished toiletries taken away. Small things that could make a big difference. Overall location was great. 5 minutes to metro. Supermarket along road to left of hotel.
