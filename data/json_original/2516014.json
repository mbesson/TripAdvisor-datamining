Other than the LA Convention Center not much around it to walk to of interest. Not many restaurants that are walkable in the area so you are locked into using their restaurant, unfortunately. Lobby sofas and chairs are showing wear, especially the front area, with the very squished Ikat print pillows, that look like someone spent the night on them. Staff are very professional and courteous. Rooms are spacious but rather cold and too slick for my taste. Could never get the room cool enough to sleep under the comforter, it was always too hot to sleep with anything other than the top sheet. No bath tub. Shower control for a rain shower was placed where no matter what you do you get hit with cold water to turn it on. Charge for internet in the guest rooms but in the public areas you could log on free only 1 time per day. However, the worse thing was the food in the only restarant, LA Market. Cold atmosphere, all glass and cables. Service is good. Breakfast buffet is expensive but does have made to order omelets. DO NOT ORDER THE \"FRENCH TOAST\" It is basically 1/2 piece of a slice of bread. It was dry, it did not seem to have been dipped in a milk and egg mixture which would actually make it french toast, it just seemed to be bread toasted on a griddle. The Chop Chop Salad sounds delicious on the menu but the salad was cut up so small and mixed together with a strong over powering mustard vinegrette that you could not taste what little bacon or egg was actually in the salad (trust me, it was very little, just enough to be able to say these were ingredients). And run for your life away form the Messe Plate. I have to say it was actually terrible. I have never had tabuleh with no tomatoes, parsley, or onions in it. unitl I had it here. Just a bunch of bulgar wheat with no lemon juice, just tasted like water. Shame on this chef!!! The only good thing on the menu was their very expensive LA Market Hamburger which was actually surprisingly good.

I stayed 5 nights in mid-April. The rooms are large and relatively quiet with views. Even from my room only on the 10th floor I could see all the way to the Hollywood sign. A few very small annoyances: the window would make a loud pop periodically during the day and at night. Also housekeeping does not seem to make it around until 3 or 4pm, a little bit awkward since I was attending a convention and would often come back to the room late in the day for a change of clothes after sessions before the evening events. Lesson learned - when I would leave in the morning I requested make up service and it was done right away. Excellent climate control, by the way, that can sometimes be an issue in these big hotels. There is free wifi in the lobby areas, but it is a $12.95/day charge in the room. Parking is $40/night in the garage, there is a surface parking lot that is only $8/day across the street - closer to the freeway. The place handles the crowds well, there were events at Staples Center several nights during my stay and though things get a little busy outside at LALive, the hotel always had things organized.

We liked the modern, comfortable public spaces. Service was friendly and accommodating. We had a king room on a low (5th) floor. I was concerned about potential street noise, but we never had a problem. The room was very clean and like new. There was plenty of storage space so we were able to unpack and keep the room tidy during our stay. The room had a small fridge, in-room coffee, a safe, and nice workspace/desk and a small sofa/daybed. There's a charge for wireless internet in the room, which I find ridiculous. There were plenty of electrical outlets so we could charge our various devices with outlets left over and without putting them on the floor. The bathroom had only a shower--no tub--with a really, really lame water saving shower head. We thought it actually wasted water, as we took three times as long in the shower trying to rinse. The bathroom also had a magnification mirror, which I appreciated. There is a shortage of counter space and no shelf, so even if you pack light on toiletries you might find yourself hard pressed to find places to put your things. The gym was good, with plenty of treadmills, ellipticals, and two upright bikes. I noticed one recumbent bike. The equipment was in good condition and worked for the most part. One morning two of the treadmills were out of order in a continuous initializing mode. There were also weight machines, free weights, exercise balls, medicine balls, and a small open space. The only thing that slightly marred my stay was an incident early one morning. A gentleman got on the elevator with me and pushed the button for a different floor. He exited the elevator on my floor and seemed to be following me. I stepped aside to let him pass and was very surprised to see him stop at my room and proceed to bang on the door and shout for the occupants to open it. When there was no response, he asked the maid to let him in to the room because, he claimed, there was an emergency in there. What disturbs me is that the maid appeared ready to open the door for him until I stepped forward and said it was my room. Once I did that, the man said he was on the wrong floor, apologized, and rushed off. It seems that the maids should not randomly open rooms for people claiming to have emergencies. I would think SOP would dictate that security be summoned first. Despite that incident, we enjoyed our stay and found the JW Marriott comfortable.

I had to get there before 5 a.m. and still had to wait 10 minutes for cardio equipment, and the wait wasn't any better after 5 p.m. So, if you want to work-out, go at an off-hour. These are minor gripes and what prevented me from giving it 5 stars; overall, the hotel is lovely with lots of options for dining.

They have an Illy espresso bar, a wine bar and a place for breakfast. If you prefer Starbucks there's one right next to the hotel in the LA live complex. I will say that the complex was very busy the entire time were there with an NCAA basketball tournament, a Lakers Game, a Clippers Game and the premier of the Hunger Games. It was exciting but there were a lot of people in and around the hotel lobby at all times. We did have dinner at WP 24 which is at the Ritz Carlton next door.

The hotel is enormous, and attached to the convention centre. Brand new, and impeccably clean, the hotel staff was friendly and always ready to help. Room service and food service staff were a pleasure to chat with, and always professional. The business centre was also very helpful with friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are nicely furnished, contemporary-feeling, with large walk-in shower (no tub), with some nice toiletries. Housekeeping was great and respectful of my things. I ordered room service on several nights when I worked very late, the portions are quite large, always thoughtfully plated, made me feel taken care of after some very long days. You have climate control in each room, and a large armchair and couch, tv with lots of clothes storage space (wardrobe and large dressers). My favourite part of the furnishings was the desk/table on small wheels that you could drag to wherever you needed it in your room. When I'd finally get to my room at night, I could order room service, pull the desk to the side of the bed, and eat in bed comfortably, while watching some trashy tv before crashing. Small things like that make me very happy. Outside of the hotel, you walk right into LA Live -- where there is an array of restaurants. My favourite, I went twice during my 1 week stay, was Katsuya. Try their seafood sampler, or crispy tuna rice dish. AMAZING.

It's new, modern, elegant. Gorgeous lobby and good restaurants. The rooms are gigantic. For anyone doing business or attending events at the convention or the Staples Center it's a great location, and an easy walk to other attractions. I was disappointed by housekeeping, though. The first morning, I left the room around mid-morning and made sure to put the Do Not Disturb sign back inside. I was at the convention center all day, returning around 5. And NO ONE had serviced the room! The bed was unmade, the coffee supplies not replenished, the trash baskets full. I called guest services right away and they apologized up and down and said they'd send someone up right away to get things put to rights. I had to leave again so went off confident that when I returned I'd have a nice clean room and empty waste baskets. Got back to the room again about 10 PM only to find that IT WAS STILL A MESS. Somebody dropped the ball, big time. I called guest services again and told them what I thought of their \"service.\" They apologized up and down, asked if I wanted someone to come up now (as if! I wanted to hit the sack) and asked if they could give me a free breakfast among other things I didn't want. Finally I was offered a credit to my account that I accepted though still wasn't particularly mollified. For a higher priced hotel, this lapse showed incredible sloppiness and negligence. Other minor irritations included the gigantic illuminated sign right outside my window (on the south side of the building) that was on all night, and the curtains didn't close quite tightly enough to shut the light out completely. Also at 5 the next morning loud amplified music started to boom and continued until I just decided to get up since I couldn't sleep any longer. Never did figure out where it was coming from. Finally, whoever planned the room layout made a mistake in not locating the refrigerator in the cabinet just inside the door, instead of right under the TV in the bedroom proper. It was pretty noisy in both rooms (I asked to move after the loud booming music and got an identical room on the other side; alas, the fridge in that room was even louder; I had to unplug it).

This is a luxury hotel and you pay what you get for. This is the most I have ever paid for a room. We booked a junior suite for 3 nights - the price difference between a room and a junior suite was not great so we upgraded. The hotel booked up very quickly after the Grammy nominations were announced - we booked that very night - more than 2 months ahead of time. I did research for other attendees and the price at the JW was in line with other nearby hotels. The room itself was great - I joked that if you jumped out the window you would land on the Staples Center. We were that close. The view - facing the Staples Center was spectacular. The junior suite we had was a corner room on the 12th floor with windows on two sides. The layout didn't make the most use of space but it felt very spacious. Upon entering, you step into a space about the size of a small hotel room that has a couch in it and a bar. Then, a small hall leads to the main room with the bathroom on the right (large step in shower - a bathtub would have been nice but not a huge issue) and big sink area. We could have used a little more closet space but again not a major issue. The bed was super comfy and at the far end was a couch with two large chairs and a coffee table - we were able to comfortably entertain guests in our room (the only issue was getting them up since all floors are key carded - great for safety but not great for having people come up - you either leave a list at the front desk or come down and get them). We had two little issues - one was lousy internet signal which we paid $12.95 a day for (we received a refund when I requested it - the front desk said the hotel was full and that was the reason - we had to use the hot spot on my phone) and the only room service we ordered (breakfast on the day of the Grammys for 2 which cost $60 and was nothing super fancy) came 45 minutes late and we had to gulp it down. Also requested and got a refund for that. Overall, I would stay here again despite the little issues. The staff was very attentive and met all of our needs and was eager to help when we had issues - the request to refund met with no argument.

First the positive: Front desk and concierge service is top notch. Rooms are spacious and clean. The location Is great if you are attending an event. Areas that need serious improvement: The service in both the lobby lounge and the mixing longe is absolutely terrible. On a Monday evening we went to the mixing lounge and sat at a table (the bar was full but the seating area only had 8 people seated) and waited for approximately 10 minutes to order. There were 2 waitresses working but seemed to be more interested in talking to each other than serving customers. I finally went to the bar and ordered. In the hour I was seated at a table not 1 of the staff asked if I would like anything else or even approached me. this is unacceptable particularly when you are paying top $$ for cocktails. The lobby bar is not much better. I was also really disappointed in the housekeeping service. I left my room at approx. 1 PM and saw that housekeeping was servicing the adjacent room. I returned to my room at 5PM and the room had not been cleaned. I spoke with the front desk and they acted like it was no big deal and they would have someone service it. I'm sorry but at $300+ a night it was a big deal to me. The gym is great but he again the staff really need to work on their customer service skills. Too long of a story to bother with...

All downtown LA hotel parking is expensive, so I was thrilled to get a substantial discount. The valet pickup area was very busy, but the wait to get my car was less than 10 minutes.

The reason I knocked a star off of my review this time was the extra charge ($12.95 per day) for wireless internet service, which in late 2011 I believe is a straight-up ripoff, and the fact that the general level of maintenance / upkeep / housekeeping was not, for me, at the 5 star level.

This one was on the 21st floor and a junior suite. Upon entering I marveled at the size of the room and the clever planning of its spaces. It had a large bedroom area and a large sitting room and work area. The bathroom was very big and had a shower stall but no bath tub. The view was excellent too. Being a platinum elite member I had access to the lounge and free internet as well. The room and the beds were one the most comfortable ones. Toiletries were of high quality and the lounge offerings were very good too. My stay was excellent in most aspects but the only negative points were as follows:Parking rate for valet parking is extremely high at 40 bucks a night. Although there were plenty options in the vicinity I was not feeling great to park my car elsewhere and preferred the security of the hotel. To receive your vehicle , you need to take a different elevator to the basement where they would pull up the car for you.

There are many dining choices right outside the back entrance, which opens onto LA Live. What we were not aware of is that the hotel was being used to film a 'flash mob' scene for a tv show. The lobby was full of people, including some that seemed to have come in from the street just to hang out. My husband was wearing a hat from the local university, where the first football game was being played that weekend. It caught the attention of someone who started going on, very loudly and with a lot of profanity, about how the team better win because he had a lot of money bet on the game. Sat down next to us and made us a little nervous....to the point of others moving away. Getting through the lobby was a little tough, with the flash mob participants everywhere, practicing. No eating at the hotel, or having a drink at the bar; it had been rented out for the television show. Found a great restaurant in the LA Live area, then tried to get back to our room. Security wouldn't allow us back in the door, as the show was being filmed. We weren't allowed to stand and watch, as they had to keep people moving for 'fire safety reasons'. So we walked back and forth for 40 minutes, entertained for a while because of the flash mob dancers, but were tired and just wanted to go back to our room. My husband told the security officer that we just wanted to get back into the hotel, and was told, very rudely, that we weren't allowed to go back in the way we came out, that we would have to walk around the building and go in through the front entrance. Finally, the filming is wrapping up and we are allowed to go back into the hotel. Went to the front desk to complain - apparantly we weren't the first, as the manager said that she was going to talk to the people in charge of the show, as it was not supposed to take over the hotel and impact the guests as much as it had.

It is now a week since I made the first complaint that they had taken all this money without authorisation and I am still waiting for the remaining $500 to be returned to me.

My only critique would be that while our room overlooked the pool, it also looked out onto the Ritz Carlton as well as the Nokia Center. This itself was not a problem - however, both of these buildings are very lit up at night (with blue and red lighting) and the drapes in the room were not heavy enough to block out the light. Thus, quite a bit of light crept in and the room was not fully dark. That may not be an issue for some people, but I feel it's worth a mention. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because of what I mentioned above about the lighting - AND - I do not consider this hotel to be a 5 star property (like the Four Seasons or Ritz), and I also did not utilize amenities such as bar, restaurant, swimming pool, concierge, etc. We paid right about $200 - I consider that to be a decent price for the quality of this property - I believe the rooms sometimes go for in excess of $300+ at which point I would probably stay at the Ritz because I don't believe this hotel warrants a rate of over $300 per night.

Unfortunately it was anything but. While the \"exquisite architectural detail\" was ok, the service was one of the worst experiences I've had in a 5 star hotel. Let me list the issues: 1. We arrived late at night and I was standing with my wife and children and a large amount of luggage for about 12 minutes as no one from the hotel actually came and asked if we needed help with our bags (there was no one else on the driveway!). When they finally arrived by the time I checked in and got to the room it was close to 45 minutes. 2. As I was arriving very late to a suite with my family I had specifically requested that a cot to be set up prior to my arrival so I could quickly get my youngest to sleep - nope. When I asked at check-in a vacant stare was my response. I had to book and chase three times before they came - with a roll away bed and NOT a cot?!?! 3. They have a bar fridge with nothing in it. Ok, this is fairly standard for the US hotels, but when I ordered room service they got it wrong. First, the bottle of wine I ordered was changed because \u201cthey are changing their wine list\u201d and the second time they left off an order 4. I went to breakfast and I was standing at the entrance waiting for someone to seat me in case this was the requirement (there is no sign by the way). After about 5 minutes I went and sat down. A lady came over to me and I asked to order and she said something to the effect, \u201coh, you\u2019re sitting there, you walked straight past me\u201d . 5. They have some funky pool thing going on for non-hotel guests. My wife went for a swim about 10:30 am and there were a bunch of drunk idiots jumping into the pool fully clothed multiple times and the staff did nothing about it. Then another time a bunch of near naked FAT people down from the pool were standing in the reception area being very loud (as they were drunk) and treating the small water/biscuit bar (that JW Marriott has there for convenience) as a buffet lunch?!? 6. They forgot one day to service my room?!? And had the gall to tell me \"oh, you must have left the \"do not disturb\" sign on your door\"!?!?

My room partner had a problem hooking up his laptop to the in-room television monitor, and two maintenece men showed up promptly (one to diagnose the problem, the other to bring the missing cable that the in-room instructions said was needed to do the hook-up).

My room partners really like the free wireless internet in the lobby area (great atmosphere and comfortable surroundings). The concierge (Joy) was very helpful in arranging our return airport shuttle, and when it didn't show up on our July 5th departure day, the concierge on duty that morning got on phone and hooked us up with a new one (the original driver apparently missed all his L.A. Live hotel runs that morning). On the minor quibbles side, there didn't seem to be a fan to vent the bathroom and since there was a large LCD screen on the front of the Ritz Carlton Tower, the Marriott rooms facing South (toward the Staples and L.A.

The curtains didn't do a good job of keeping all the light out, so eye-masks were necessary for those who were sensitive to such things (I personally slept like a log).

The Bad: Checking in Friday night was a MESS because there were at least 2 conventions going on with people staying in that hotel, and we arrived just behind 2 buses of bicyclists who all had to check in. We also didn't get the type of room we requested, even though we booked through the Marriott website. I would expect that if we had booked through Expedia or something. They said they'd send up a roll away. No real apology for the super long wait or the room, but ok. LA Live has a lot of great restaurants! Ate at the Yard House which was delish and never disappoints. Room service was frankly not worth the price. I ordered the All-American breakfast. The \"eggs\" were clearly not real egg and weren't cooked how I had asked. Sausage was like that weird, hard, English sausage. Bacon was the 2 smallest pieces of bacon I've ever seen. The potatoes were good. My friend had eggs benedict, which she did enjoy, but wasn't as hot as she would have liked. There is a Ralph's within walking distance from the hotel (also has free parking w/ validation below if you'd like to drive), so I would suggest stopping there and getting something to eat. Also, overnight parking is $40 a night. Expedia and the Marriott sometimes offer packages for about $20 extra a night that include parking and a resort credit, so keep an eye out for that. Only bad part of the pool is that about 4pm ish the sun starts to dip behind the building so you have to move to the spa because you will freeze in the pool. The Good: Saturday we spent most of the day at the pool which was surprisingly not crowded. The Marriott has a salt water pool which is so much gentler on your skin. Really great. My new favorite bartender is Jos (like Jose without the e), who made me a delicious watermelon margarita with real watermelon. Oddly, the pool bar doesn't have a blender, so daquiris and the like weren't an option. If you go to the bar, make sure you talk to Jos! He is SO AWESOME! He'll take the time to find you a drink you like. The rooms are super comfortable and spacious. Rooms look exactly like they do on the website and the standard rooms are more spacious than I expected. They also have this cool feature where if you bring a laptop and a HDMI cable, you can plug it into the desk and watch movies on TV. The rooms are also equipped with an iHome which I love for plugging in my iPod and playing dj. The standard feather pillows are a bit too nice and soft for me. So if you like a little height, I'd suggest calling housekeeping for a non-feather pillow. Otherwise, the beds are great! We didn't visit on this trip, but the burgers at the LA Market Restaurant in the lobby are pricey but TO DIE FOR! And the pretzel bread they serve while you wait is SO GOOD. Overall- This hotel is PRICEY. Expect to spend some money. To cut costs, venture out of the LA Live area. There are some really great restaurants and bars around.

There are...21 floors to this hotel. There are great elevators. But there are no stairs for everyday use. They are only for emergencies. (Just thought I'd mention this if you're like my daughter who refuses to step into an elevator.) Anyway, the rooms were fantastic. They were very modern as many newer Marriotts are. They were also very clean, including the bathroom. We stayed in a regular room (not a suite of any sort) but it was quite spacious and there were large windows that added to the nice atmosphere. Out of the 6 nights we were at the hotel we slept wonderfully in the comfortable beds and with the walls being thick (and seemingly sound proof.) The service at this hotel, for the most part, was impecable. The maid was friendly and did a fine job cleaning the room for us every day. The bellhops were amiable and efficent, along with the front desk staff, and people working at the restaurant in the hotel. The only employees we weren't fond of were the concierges. The couple of concierges that we spoke with weren't too helpful or kind. We talked to them about renting a car and they were to call the rental car company and all that, but when we awaited our car one morning it never showed up. We then realized that they never called like they were supposed to. The pool at this hotel was a lot of fun. It was roof-top on the fourth floor and there was also a rooftop pool bar. The pool was salt water which was cool and there was also a huge hot tub. The tanning areas were nice, too. The lobby at this hotel was beautiful!!! There was wi-fi in the lobby and also in the rooms, but if you use it in the rooms you're billed a ridiculous amount. We also ate breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel and it was delicious and speedy. Anyway, to finish this review up, I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, as its very convenient when going to the LA Convention center, Nokia Plaza, and the Staples center, the rooms are great, and the staff is friendly.

Tried to call home - cordless phone handset dead, despite 'charge' light. Corded phone would not reach desk area - also had a ring loud enough to startle me and no obvious control to turn down. Cheap and flimsy set to boot. Cinema-size television had extremely weak and very directional remote (cheap) that took several seconds per channel change (television signal obviously delivered via house computer network) and dropped out / broke up / went dark a LOT. Nice robe in closet for use in spa - size far too small for average guy like me, unless I wanted to flash the other guests, so no spa for you. I decided to try and get some work done - wireless NOT free (don't buy the dodge about 'free wireless in the lobby' - you get one hour and your machine is locked out by MAC address, contrary to staff's hopeful fibs, besides I paid for a ROOM to work in). Not willing to cough up $15 a night (!) for likely awful service I resorted to local Starbucks for my email and web support. After the event I worked, our team gathered for a drink in the bar - their 'best' single-malt scotch? Glenlivet. Waiter had no idea what any of the other truly good malts were - and took 15 mins to deliver one drink with the lounge virtually empty. Motivation obviously pretty low despite the tony ambiance. The lobby was filled with ear-hurtingly-loud boom-boom disco music even in the morning... not sure what that says about the place. My guess is the manager was on vacation. Combine that with the must-have-room-card-to-access-elevator (for every single guest - some trips took nearly five minutes to go through the foolishness of card-in/punch floor) and the 1960s style (ie hideous) furniture with lots of sharp corners (ow) and I felt very unwelcome. The Holiday Inn in Fremont made me feel so much more welcome - and was far less than half the price.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Mateo", "Title": "\u201cNew and Nice\u201d", "Author": "Tipster2000", "ReviewID": "UR100437077", "Content": "I stayed 4 nights at the nearly new JW Marriott Los Angeles at LA LIve. That last tag refers to the hotel's location in the new restaurant and entertainment complex connected with the Staples Center and the LA Convention Center. It is only a few hundred feet out the back door of the hotel to the Staples Center and a bit further to the convention center. On week days the hotel was primarily occupied by convention goers with name badges. This upscale hotel is very nice and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I had an executive king on the 17th floor. This room category is somewhat larger than a standard room. On the two days when the air was clear I had a spectacular 180-degree view all the way to Santa Monica, including the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Observatory. On the two hazy days the view lost its special appeal. Below was the I-110 freeway which I, surprisingly, never tired of looking at. The Santa Monica freeway was visible in the distance so I could judge how free-flowing or clogged the freeways were. The room was well insulated for sound and the freeway noise was only a low hum which was not objectionable and seldom noticed. There were two large view windows in the main room and a third large view window in the bath. Because there are no nearby buildings I left the blinds up except to sleep. The bath is large with a very large shower. There is no tub. There was lots of storage space and closet space. The room came with a safe and a robe, but no slippers. The TV is 42-inch. There was a large desk facing one of the windows which provided a pleasant place to work night or day. Room lighting was excellent and some lights had dimmers. There was a fairly comfortable lounge chair. The restaurant was good for breakfast. I found ordering from the menu was cheaper than having the buffet. I ate one dinner in the restaurant and found it fine. There are many other restaurants within one block. Everything looks relatively new. The hotel decor is modern. The public spaces are loud, but my room was quiet except for the freeway hum. Valet parking is $40 per night which is steep. The valet service was very good. Internet access is $12.95 per day.

We live 40 miles away but decided that since we had not been to the L.A. Live area since it opened, we would stay in town to explore and to avoid the midnight commute home. I did not realize this hotel had only opened in February 2010. I did not know it was connected by plaza to the Nokia Theater (and right across the street from Staples Center). I was not aware of all of the restaurants available in the plaza (Fleming's, The Yard House, ESPN Zone, Trader Vic's). I was very impressed. But not nearly as much as I was by the hospitality at the J. W. Marriott. The reception was prompt and efficient. The room was pristine and clean. The amenities were better than most. The experience was exceptional. HIGH POINTS: Good value for the dollar in an exceptional location for any event at Staples Center, the Nokia Theater or L.A. Live. Staff is efficient yet when it was time to go to our room, they walked us to the elevator. The rooms are as clean as a whistle. The valet parking was easy. To pick up your car you have to go to a basement level...again, very efficient. LOW POINTS: When their informal restaurant closes from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm, they direct you to their lobby bar. We ordered a couple drinks and a hummus plate. After waiting half an hour (and while others were served) my wife went back to the room to get ready for the evening and I insisted my waitress bring me the bill, absent the charge for food we never received. She had to get a manager to approve that....another couple minutes went by. The manager finally appeared, apologized, and explained someone had failed to show up for their shift. She thanked me for my patience. I felt that was not enough. Absent that underwhelming experience, our stay at the J. W. Marriott was a pleasant one.

No apologies about it. I was told at the desk we would have 2 queens instead, which is fine by me as we sleep on a queen at home, but once in the room it turns out it was really 2 doubles.

Arrrrgh. Ok, that's obviously not a real problem. We spent three nights here last month and completely enjoyed our stay. Though I love some of LA's other areas, it made sense for us to be downtown, and this location is well-situated. You're a 5-minute drive into the traditional downtown (we spent one evening at the rooftop bar at the Downtown Standard), 10-15 minutes to Dodger Stadium, and the hotel sits right near the I-10 and the I-110, so it's easy to connect to just about any freeway. The other bonus about the location: it sits next to the surprisingly vibrant LA Live development. In addition to the Staples Center (booo), the Nokia Theater is right there and there are a slew of bars and restaurants (we saw Don Mattingly at the YardHouse one afternoon). There's a Starbucks too, which was even busy on a Sunday morning. While we there, the development's courtyard was being converted into a stage for the X Games. We didn't notice any of the growing pains or kinks that some of the other reviewers did. Our very modern room was fairly big, had a nice TV, two comfortable beds, etc. The bathroom didn't have a lock, true, but no other coplaints. The staff seemed friendly. It's a touch pricey, but we didn't notice because we had two free nights thanks to my brother's Marriott points. We spent one afternoon in the pool (it's atop the 4th floor), which also features an outdoor bar and lounge. It hosted a private party one day, which drew a big crowd, but you couldn't hear the music from the rooms. The lobby is huge and cool, though the bar was really overpriced. One legit negative: the valet parking is $38, and there's almost no way to avoid it. All of the lots and garages nearby charge at least that for overnight parking, and there didn't seem to be any legal street spaces. And, obviously, you need a car in LA.

Because the Anime Expo was going on there was a large number of people in and out of the hotel all day but we never had to wait more than 30 seconds for an elevator to get to our room, plus the conference attendees just added to our entertainment with all their costumes. It got a little noisy the first night but the hotel must have had staff to monitor this because it got quiet real quick without having to call the front desk. \"Rashad\" was also very helpful when we needed something for our room. The pool is beautiful and well maintained. The hotel itself is very modern and clean. Wifi service is free in the main areas of the hotel but there is a charge if you use it in your room. The customer service in the hotel was impeccable and I will definitely choose this hotel again. I have two very minor complaints about the hotel. The maid service did not replace toiletries every day in the room as hotels usually do. It was okay though because we had brought our own stuff and I assume that the maid saw that and figured we did not need additional. The second complaint is the parking is expensive at $38.00 a day but that is probably the going rate for LA hotels.

Overall, not bad, but a little sterile, i.e., could use some art on the walls in the guestroom floors, better signage in the elevators as to what was on each floor, etc. I was upgraded to a corner king junior suite on the 21st floor (top of the JW side but the attached Ritz-Carlton starts on the higher floors and probably goes up at least 20 more). Stunning views of the freeways, downtown LA, and if the day was clear, you could probably have seen all the way to the Pacific. Executive lounge is on the 4th floor, adjacent to the pool area. Nice space, evening food selections so-so (cheese, crackers, crudit\u00e9 and two hot items) but enough to make dinner out of. Wine selection great - 3 choices for white and two for red (in most Marriott and even JW Marriott properties there are usually only two wine choices - red or white :-) and pricing is relatively reasonable ($9.00/glass for white, $12.00/glass for red). I went out in search of ice and at the elevator lobby on my floor saw a directional sign pointing to the \"Ice & Vending\" area (pic #1). Walked that direction and at the next turn saw a sign (pic #2) pointing towards guest rooms to the right and left, but couldn't find the ice machine to save my life. Went back to the elevator lobby and picked up the house phone which rang immediately to the \"At Your Service\" folks and was answered within two rings. Was told that the nearest ice machine was on the 18th floor (pic #3), so I ventured down three levels and by golly I found it (pic #4)! But why the sign on the 21st floor pointing to the non-existent ice machine??? I'll write that off to \"newness\" but I wonder if they have plans to install a vending area on floor 21 or if the sign is wrong (incidentally, you'll notice that pic #1 mentions room 2144, yet it isn't mentioned on pic #2 - that's because it doesn't exist - the highest room number on 21 is 2142 :-). Gym is nice - my judgment of a good hotel gym is if they have the large inflated exercise balls (they have three), and all of the standard equipment. Plenty of treadmills but only two bikes. Overall, I think this is a nice hotel, just needs a little time to be broken in, but it's one of the best hotels to open in downtown LA in years.

Check in was good. I was appropriately recognized as a Platinum Premier elite member of Marriott Rewards (maybe just as a Platinum on the first visit; I don't recall, and it really doesn't matter). The first stay I was directed to the various features of the hotel. On the second stay I was upgraded to the Vice Presidential Suite on the 15th floor. The room decor is nice (the standard room better than the suite). One thing I dislike about most hotel suites is that the bedroom is often much smaller than in a normal room. While the bedroom in this room was larger than in most suites, it was nevertheless smaller. TV actually has some channels in HD, but I was disappointed there was no My13 (I like to fall asleep watching Seinfeld at 10pm when I'm in LA). There is a media port on the side of the desk; although I did not use this, it would come in handy to stream video or watch DVDs from your laptop (assuming you bring appropriate cables). The air conditioning was inadequate in both rooms. While I love the nice thick duvet, I could not get the rooms cool enough to sleep comfortably. Also, I think the beds are a bit firmer than the Marriott beds in other properties, but perhaps they're just newer. The shower at first seemed nice, but the water pressure is woefully inadequate. I think I still have soap in my belly button. I'm sure the hotel would blame the A/C and shower issues on being \"green\" - I hope business that take \"green\" to this extent win enough additional business to offset my loss of business. The check-in agent on my first visit did point out that I had free internet access as a Platinum Elite member (per Marriott's new policy in response to Starwood's new benefit), but I did not use the service on either of my stays. Although the Concierge Lounge was great the first stay, it was closed the second stay; they said it was closed for renovation, but that's perplexing since this is a new hotel. The morning Concierge Lounge attendant was absolutely wonderful. In the Concierge Lounge Hot items varied each day and the fruit selection was quite nice. Having San Pellegrino in the lounge is also a plus in my books. A couple of hot appetizers, hard Italian cheeses, and deserts are offered in the lounge in the evenings. On the second stay, I was offered a free breakfast buffet each day as a Platinum Marriott Rewards member. Service was more leisure than accommodating; it would have been better had daily coupons been offered that could have just been left at the table instead of having each person wait on the check. Also, no Concierge Lounge on the second stay meant no extra water or soft beverages than what came in the room. I really like the gym, but depending on what else is going on at the hotel, it can be VERY crowded in the mornings. The machines are all new and modern, and they include HD TVs (although the HD signal is poor on many of the machines and often pixelate so much that the local channels are unwatchable). Like the rooms, the gym is also very warm. Too bad the machines don't have the little built-in fans like at the Marriott Downtown. One thing I really hate about this hotel is that they do not put hotel receipts under the door. You have to go down and get the receipts from the front desk - a complete waste of time for the business traveler. Too bad Marriott doesn't post receipts online like Hilton. And while I also get receipts emailed to me, I find this to sometimes be unreliable (and one college doesn't ever get them even though he is signed up for this service). I did not use room service, but other colleagues found the service extremely slow and inaccurate. However, if you complain about issues, the hotel does seem to throw free stuff your way (free beer and bottled water with room service, bonus Marriott Rewards points for other problems). There just seems to be a lot of employees standing around at this hotel but no one really doing anything. We experienced this at the hotel restaurant for breakfast needing drinks and bills without our waitress in sight, but plenty of others were standing around doing nothing. Same for the valet pickup. And speaking of valet parking, you have to go down to the bowels of the garage to get your car and snake out of the maze that is the LA Live garage. The location and the logistics are really a hassle. I may stay here occasionally, but it's just too much of a hassle to stay here regularly.

Hubby and I stayed here for 2 nights the weekend before Memorial Day. The Lakers were in the play-offs, but not at home, so the hotel was busy, but not completely full. After spending a week in another (awful) hotel just a few miles away for business, this was a welcome treat! Friday afternoon LA traffic was horrible -- not surprisingly. We pulled up to the hotel and the valet were quick to whisk the car away. We knew it was going to be $38 a night for parking there (with in and out privilege -- and be sure to ask for the valet extension and call ahead, so you don't have to wait for your car when you do want to leave). If I had not gotten a bargain on the rental car (full-size, less than $20 per day with taxes and fees), we may have opted for using taxis. In the end, we were happy to have the convenience of a car so that we could come and go as we pleased. The lobby is huge. Or, the ceiling is so high, it definitely SEEMS huge! I've noticed other reviewers weren't \"sure\" where check-in was, but when you walk in, there's 3 or 4 \"counters\" or check-in desks straight in front of you -- what else would they be? There are also a number of folks in \"uniform\" -- well, tan Marriott-issued suits with hot pink ties that match the decor (especially some of the lighting -- above and to the right) to guide you. It was mere seconds before someone offered to help us with our luggage and to check us in. I, personally, like the open feeling and not being \"smushed\" up against a wall to check in. One of the first things you'll notice is that the hotel is not your typical Marriott. The decor is a cross between Euro/60s modern/70s colors/80s flair/Japanese Zen -- and somehow, it works. (see pictures) It seems modern and retro, lively and serene, all at the same time. Being platinum with Marriott Rewards we got upgraded to a corner, executive King room on the 13th floor (26 floors, I think) and free internet. The room was huge with picture windows on two sides to the east and to the south overlooking Nokia theatre and Staples Center, as well as the LA Live! district. The daytime views were spectacular -- including Catalina Island in the distance. The nighttime views with the search-lights and neon was almost as pretty. Even the bathroom had a huge \"picture\" window overlooking Staples Center and the LA convention center, as well as the 4th floor rooftop pool, below. Again, the decor was eclectic -- and while not my preference in color choice (orange?) -- it somehow works. The windows had sheers, as well as room-darking drapes that worked; the bathroom had a room darkening roman shade for nighttime, too. The room was VERY quiet and quite large. The only \"noise\" I heard was 2 neighbors' doors slamming at 2:30 in the morning on the 2nd night. I probably heard them because everything else was so quiet. And they're are the kind of self-closing doors that slam shut if you let them. And people are lazy -- especially at 2:30 in the morning. The bathroom was huge. No, there was no bathtub -- but seriously, I have not taken a bath in well over 10 years and never missed it. I loved the walk-in shower (big enough for two, but could use a shower head at both ends to make that work) -- and with it not being a bathtub, it's much easier and safer to get in and out of... The water pressure does seem low -- but I believe that's a result of the \"low flow\" faucets in all of the new or redone hotels in the area. I rather enjoyed it as it was very relaxing and it took maybe 10 seconds longer to rinse my hair (and I'm a woman). The toiletries were very nice and the sink area is huge with a nice shelf below to store things, too. We asked for extra pillows -- I have a bad knee and like to elevate it -- and they were delivered in less than 10 minutes. On the second night, one of the managers I had been engaging in conversation sent us dessert to our room. This was a surprise, and we were more surprised when we got a phone call stating that room service was outside our door with a delivery and we had a \"do not disturb\" sign out... Hmm. Last I checked \"Do Not Disturb\" meant we didn't want to be disturbed... Hubby got up and obligingly let them in -- they did come bearing chocolate-covered strawberries, after all... However, if it had been 20 or 30 minutes earlier -- I would have been VERY upset as it would have been a very unwelcome interruption. I probably should have mentioned this at check-out, but forgot. The concierge lounge was closed for the weekend -- this is nothing new. Most close at noon on Friday and re-open at noon on Sunday. However, it's hit or miss as to whether you can get still get breakfast coupons -- we did not, here. We had drinks and appetizers (or \"small plates\") in the \"Glance\" bar. The service was excellent and so was the food. We both had 2 glasses of wine. The prices were no higher than the other hotel I was at in the same area, earlier in the week, where the service was non-existent and the food was horrible. Saturday, it was quite busy in the hotel lobby as there was a professional bicycle race passing through town and stopping at LA Live for the day. We went to the Farm of Beverly Hills for brunch at L.A. Live! -- excellent food and Bloody Mary's were on special -- even better! Even though hubby and I used to live in Long Beach, we spent the day playing \"tourist\". Everything we wanted to do and see was within 20-30 mins of the hotel. We went to Griffith Park and the Observatory, drove as close as we could get to the Hollywood sign, and then spent time in Hollywood on the Blvd and Sunset. We had had a busy day and decided to have dinner at the Hotel; although the L.A. Live! complex has choices such as the Yard House, Conga Line, Flemings, and more. Dinner was VERY good -- I had meatloaf that was superb and hubby had a lobster linguine dish that looked divine (I'm allergic). Service was good and prices were not too far out of line and the food quality was excellent. It was so good we decided to have breakfast there the next morning. It was too late for the buffet, so we ordered off the breakfast/lunch menu. Service was 180 degrees from the evening before -- taking forever just to get water or our drinks brought to the table. The food was good, but if we were on any kind of time schedule, we would have had to leave before getting our food. Breakfast, even lunch, usually doesn't take over an hour. This did. Because of the delay, I asked for a late check-out time and was granted 2:30. I think we could've even stayed longer if we had needed. We went to the pool and jacuzzi. It was windy -- and too cool for swimming in the pool -- but the jacuzzi was very nice. Big. Clean. Deep. Nice jets with interesting movements. After that, we walked to the movie theaters and took in a matin\u00e9e before leaving for the airport. My one area of complaint would be the concierge staff. I needed to print something and as I noted, the \"concierge\" lounge is closed on weekends. As a Marriott platinum elite, I'm used to being able to print anything at any time -- for free. I called and asked about the business center and was told it, too, was closed, with a \"but\". I was told that there were computers and printers outside the business center available 24/7. Cool. Not. These computers/printers required a credit card to use! The concierge on the phone had not mentioned this. So I went to the concierge desk and he offered to let me use his computer and printer as I had to access a password protected website. Nice gesture, but he should have been more attentive to what I was asking for in the first place -- I told him on the phone I was platinum and was used to NOT paying to print anything! Maybe he was having a bad day -- but he certainly did nothing to make mine any better! That was Saturday. On Sunday, when it was time to leave, I asked the young lady working the concierge desk if she could call and have the valet ready our car and handed her the claim check. She tells me I need to go \"downstairs\" -- when you needed your car you went down into the parking garage to pick it up from the valet. I said, \"Great! Can you please tell me the extension to call to have them ready my car and where a house phone is that I can call them from!\" She looked at me like I was from another planet. My hubby was approaching, then, with our luggage. She just stared at him. I said to him, \"All I asked is for her to call the valet to get our car ready and I guess they don't do that here.\" Just then she says, \"Oh -- I can do that!\" In a very snotty tone of voice. If we weren't leaving, I would have brought that up to management -- but we needed to get on the road. (Very odd that both my experiences with the concierge desk personnel were bad. Everything else had gone so nice at the hotel. I get the impression that neither were very experienced in their positions.) All in all, I would return to the JW Marriott L.A. Live! We had a \"new opening\" rate of $209 a night and the location could not be beat for what we wanted to do. Would love to return and take in a show at the Nokia -- it's supposed to be quite nice.

It's clearly trying to be hip and trendy and, for the most part, it succeeds. On the outside: the hotel is right next door/on top of LA Live, including the Staples Center, Nokia Theater, etc. Thus, it's walking distance to many restaurants. It is not close to othe LA attractions. Hotel parking is very expensive at $38/day; there is parking at LA Live for $25. Consider whether you need to park a car as there is a Hertz desk inside the hotel. On the inside -- public areas: It's all very modern. As others have said, none of the desks (registration, concierge) are marked but there are plenty of people to direct you. There was never a long wait. There is a lobby bar but, the one time I tried it, it was impossible to find a seat. The tables and chairs are grouped such that, if one person sits down alone, it means that about 5 seats are out of service unless you want to be up close and personal with a total stranger. And, in one of the bars 1/2 of the tables were \"reserved,\" although no one was sitting at them. I gave up and went to my room. The rooms: I had a high floor room with a wonderful view. Decor is quite modern (\"sofa\" looked nice but wasn't very functional) and not at all reminiscent of most Marriotts at which I've stayed -- lots of black and earth tones and light wood. Bed was fine, TV was a large flat screen, robe was a nice touch. I don't believe there was a mini-bar but I never actually checked. The bathroom has a huge shower only, no tub. I found the \"rainfall\" shower annoying as it was hard to get shampoo out of your hair w/o spending about 5 mins to do it -- not much water pressure. The room was very quiet -- not sure if that holds true for low floor rooms. Towels were plush but that could be because they, like the hotel, are new. Miscellaneous notes: Elevators were quite prompt for such a large hotel. Internet service is $12.95 for 24 hrs. Restaurant choices are somewhat limited for such a large hotel but, as noted, you're steps away from many great choices. When there is a large convention in the hotel, it gets noisy and crowded in the public areas and you start to feel like a number despite the best efforts of the staff to make things personable. Summary: The JW is expensive; you're really paying for location. If you don't need to be in the heart of LA Live, you can probably do as well at other hotels in terms of what you get for the money. If you need to be here for business or pleasure, the Marriott delivers a good product, albeit at a price.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for Staples centre and LA Live Community\u201d", "Author": "erwk05", "ReviewID": "UR63073265", "Content": "We stayed at JW Marriott in April, just 2 months after opening. I was concerned as whether any issues would be ironed out by this time, as I have read other reviews on new places with problems. All of the Staff were excellent here and the hotel was great. We arrived at 7am and were given two rooms sort of through a fire exit type door near to the pool area. the pool area seemed fairly quiet, no big parties etc. happening up there. The location was excellent as we were attending 2 NBA games and an NHL game at Staples Centre during our stay. The lights around the LA Live complex were very pretty and the restaurants were great (in Particular Flemings steak house) The Hotel is a little out of the way from Hollywood but we found cabs quite easy to get around. The only gripe we had was the 5th floor windows had some overactive loud seagulls who loved talking to and attacking their reflections banging on the windows from about 6am. I would stay at this hotel again if I were to stay in LA but probably on a higher floor to avoid those seagulls. I enjoyed the LA Live Complex which added extra points for JW Marriott\u2019s review", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cIt is not worth the money\u201d", "Author": "cynicaltouchstone", "ReviewID": "UR60970980", "Content": "I had a terrible experience when I checked in.

We already knew parking was $38 - way out of line but there was no obvious alternative, and with several suitcases and children, being on site is convenient - still too expensive though. The hotel is beautiful, clean and contemporary. Still smells brand new. The front desk were fine and friendly. Dinner in the hotel was lovely - fresh food, but it was a full restaurant the night we were there and it took us 45 mins to get our meal, no apologies. Our meal cost around $130, including a couple of largers. We ask about conceirge lounge, it isnt finished yet we are told. We ask about vouchers for breakfast - something Marriotts will offer if the lounge is closed, they say after consultation that we can have free breakfast. We then get a call telling us they will give us free breakfast, great. We have breakfast , have to ask twice for coffee. We tell the staff about the voucher situ and they say thats fine and we get $20 each so covers the buffet) we get a bill, we write on the bill that we are members. We are planning to extend our stay as one of the children is ill. We book the room again, go to see front desk, they have a bill so far including breakfast charge $67. After a bit of discussion they say they will take the charge off but that we were only entitled to the adults getting complimentary breakfast($42), which is fine but someone has to tell us surely??We eat breakfast one more day (we each only have cereal and toast (milk a day out of date and coffee once again doesnt arrive till we have finished eating, the waitress only charges cereal and one continental about $23), and then the rest of the time we go to starbucks - just less hassle eventhough it costs us. The room was great, spacious and fresh, decor different, we liked it but think it will date very quickly. Bathroom a good space - lovely and clean, lots of towels.Toilet a bit annoying, got blocked a few times. The sliding door on the bathroom didnt give a lot of privacy - ok for us but maybe not so good if you were with a friend. Our room was high and we could hear the noise from the Staples didnt bother us but might be worse lower down. Location good for the Staples and Noikia centers, and not bad for travelling around from - near a few main freeways etc. We didn't walk about in the evenings though as didnt feel that safe out of the immediate vacinity. Advertised as pool, spa coffee bar etc, none of these are yet finished / open, the children were disappointed about the pool area being closed - it was too cold anyway but they still like to go in the tub. The coffee shop wasnt open, and there was no shop. Fitness center well equipped - great. We stayed for a variety of rates from $174 to $239 plus of course the $38 per day parking, really makes it expensive, and will be more so I imagine once all finished. On the whole a great new hotel, we liked the style and newness, staff generally ok, but seemed to be a hassle to get anything done.", "Date": "April 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cRight in LA downtown, hi end, good for the fans\u201d", "Author": "DoesNotGetOutMuch", "ReviewID": "UR60283412", "Content": "The JW and the Ritz are new additions downturn and they sure are high end.

But I couldn't complain - this place was never more than 20 minutes away from where we wanted to go. The lobby is EXCEPTIONAL. We had a few drinks there one night - great vibe. The staff was all wonderful too. The rooms were nice, but my husband and I didn't love the decor (we are both 28 years old, and the curtains and other yellow/orange theme reminded us too much of our parents outdated 1970's living rooms).

We had actually planned to switch to the Hollywood Marriott Renaissance for our last night because of the great reviews, but ended up cancelling so we could stay here another night and instead go to the LA Kings game.

Its connected to the Rirz Carlton but the Ritz did not seem to be open when we were there. Good place to stay if you have a reason to stay downtown, would not really recommend downtown if you don't have a reason to be there, its not too exciting. It would be a real good place for the USC visiitors, short easy drive down Figueroa. The crowd at LA Live tends to go with whatever the activities are currently playing.
