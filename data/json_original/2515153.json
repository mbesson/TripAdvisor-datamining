We obtained this hotel through Voyage Prive and the price we paid was amazing compared to hotel tarrif. We booked own flights through Flybe and caught Roissy Bus from CDGaulle airport to Opera for 10 Euros p/person. We stupidly did not plan our route to reach hotel in advance, however free maps in airport - Rue de Pointiue is parallel with Champs Elyssee - near central point. We walked from Opera to hotel, took about 1/2 hour 1st time - down Rue Massenbeuh (something to that effect!) onto Rue de Bo\u00eete, turn left off here. Hotel staff are so friendly and multi lingual, shame because often fun trying to speak the lingo. Understated fascade to hotel, modern and clean inside. Made to feel very welcome. Our room 156 on 1st floor facing a bar and a small Chinese cafe. Good size, given trip advisor reviews stated small. Comfy bed, mini bar with plenty room for own items. Microwave also! Bath robes and slippers always nice. Disturbed both nights sleep from partying revellers on the street, shouting men - huge temptation to lean out of window and shout back \"fermez la Bouche!\". Could hear underground - only a little, only realised what it was due to other trip advisor reviews. Didn't bother us. Breakfast excellent, not a huge choice but adequate. All fresh produce, croissants, cheese, ham, pancakes, yogurt, different breads and your usual trad. English fry up. Non greasy, scrambled eggs gorgeous! Loved the courgette and the hash browns non greasy too. Staff were delightful, shame all hotels you stay at don't have staff like these! Excellent location for sight seeing, we did everything on foot (yes my legs are now killing me!) Paris is expensive - dearer than London but cheaper than Barbados! Tiny glass of wine will set you back 6-8 Euros, same for a beer! Amazing when both are French so not imported..........!!! Be prepared to queue ......and i mean queue at all tourist sights, sorry we did not - the prices astronomical! 14 Euros each to get into the Louvre with 3 fascades of the pyramid queuing!!! Ok if you dont want to see Lonardo de Vinci painting you pay only 10 Euros p/person. Eiffel Tower, thought I was at a football match amount of people queuing - personally preferred it from a distance. The boat ride on Seine, we would have if we hadn't seen half the sites on day 1 on foot. 15 Euros boat ride p/person hop on/off at each sight. Enormous queue for ticket, then another queue double size each time boat arrived! Moulin Rouge situated in Montmartre area, very seedy, not a place to take your kids. Drunks and homeless people in this area, streets littered and not so clean witnessed a few arrests from thieves operating in gangs in this area - handbags. Also, champs Elyssee, evenings teenage females of BME appearance will walk at speed into you and them check what they managed to steel at the shop entrances. Saw this happen so be careful. Finally, try the Paul Boulanger near hotel - turn left outside hotel entrance, keep walking and on you right, fabulous cougette quiche, strawberry tarts and other delectable items!!! Also, Chez Diep Chinese/Vietnamese next to hotel - pricy altho great food and female host superb! We would not return to Paris, seen it, although would highly recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, definitely will be coming back\u201d", "Author": "Deborah77s", "ReviewID": "UR127018828", "Content": "It is just 2 minutes from Champ de Elysees and metro station.

The location is superb, a block away from Champs Elysees and a major Metro station (F. D. Roosevelt). There are many lovely bistros, and stores to shop at, as well as Monoprix and Franprix where they sell groceries, fresh and frozen foods within a 2 block radius. The hotel has a wonderful buffet breakfast at $20 Euros per person, which although pricey was of excellent quality and allowed us to bypass lunch for a snack and dinner, when we were out all day.

The hotel is located one street off of Champs Elysees. I loved the location because, while super close to Champs Elysees, it was on a quieter not hectic street. I travel quite frequently, and have been to Paris several times. This was one of my best hotel experiences in Paris I ever had. The hotel lobby was chic and looked new. The rooms were nice, too. My only warning... the hallways and rooms all had low ceilings. I'm 6'2, and I felt that if I was 1 or 2 inches taller, I would be hitting the ceiling. My room was quite small, too, but this is normal for Paris hotel. The room was well-appointed and very clean and modern. The staff was very nice. It was my first time in Paris where the people were all happy to let me practice my French! Usually when I speak my not-perfect French, Parisians immediately speak to me in English. Every staff member, including the waitress at the hotel's restaurant, continued to speak to me in French or helped me when I forgot a word in French. In short, everyone was friendly and courteous. Some nice touches... wi-fi internet was free (I hate other hotels that will charge you $300/night, and then nickel-and-dime you), and breakfast was free (at least, I didn't think I had paid for an increased rate that had included breakfast). And amazingly, there was no extra charge to have breakfast sent to your room. It was such a pleasure to have breakfast in bed on New Year's Day!! I am a veteran traveler. As long as you're not too tall, and your room size expectations are proper for Paris, then this hotel was great! Lastly, as for price, it wasn't cheap, but for New Year's week and location next to Champs Elysees, it was not as expensive as many others in the area.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai (Bombay), India", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "saps_76", "ReviewID": "UR88182080", "Content": "i was at Paris for a conference at Palais de congres and this hotel is very close from there, just 4 metro station.

My husband and I moved across town to the Beauchamps after staying in an ok, but definitely small, \"business\" class hotel for a conference near the Place de R\u00e9publique. Our 6 nights in the Beauchamps were meant to be a very special treat to celebrate our first trip to Europe together and our first real vacation in almost 2 years. We had spent an incredible amount of time beforehand trying to choose a nice, elegant, modern hotel near the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and flip-flopped between several hotels and then, several room sizes, before fixing on this room. The moment we walked into the room, we knew we had made the correct choice. It was love at first sight. We paid extra to be in the \"Superior\" room and I think it was worth every penny. First off, the room was fairly large by any standard and huge by Parisian standards. It had a very comfortable, queen-sized bed, a medium-sized desk, a refrigerator, a microwave, a small closet (enough for hanging maybe 3 days worth of clothes for two people), a palatial bathroom with a shower that could easily fit about 4 people, and (very important for Paris in July) fairly good air-conditioning. The decor was very modern and everything was spotlessly clean with nice little amenities like a bathrobe, slippers, an umbrella, a tea kettle, a corkscrew, and a \"bar\" sink. Overall, the room and lobby spaces were everything we could image. We did have some complaints, mostly about service. The hotel offers a large number of amenities - which no one at the front desk seems to know about. It took until our fourth try to manage to get the pillows we wanted from the oft bragged-about \"pillow menu\"! They also had no idea that they offered a shoe-shine service (which my husband desperately needed after three weeks of walking the European streets). Normally we wouldn't care at all about any of these things, but the bizarre thing is that the \"hotel\" went out of the way to offer all these neat extras while the hotel staff looked at us like we were a little crazy when we requested them. The housekeeping was quite disappointing for this level of hotel. One day they took our towels and didn't replace them, leaving us only a face towel. Most days we didn't have a floor mat. The robe disappeared after one day and never reappeared. The tea cups and glasses were not washed or replaced. There did appear to be at least one fantastic maid because one day we ended up with everything folded very artfully, clean dishes, plentiful shampoo and soap, and a lot of lovely little touches left around the room, but that was 1/6. Again, at a lesser hotel, I would accept this type of mediocre service, but for the amount we paid, I expected a little more. Perhaps I'm just in the dark about service in European hotels in general. The hotel offers free internet at restricted speeds and with transfer limits. Normally this would have been disastrous, but since I was NOT checking work mail or concerns, it was actually perfect. We still managed to call our parents using Skype several time with no problems. They do offer a business plan - 80 Euros for a week of unrestricted speed and transfer limits. We didn't bother. One point of note - you have to know about the *free* internet beforehand and ask for a password at the front desk; it wasn't advertised in the room or lobby at all. The hotel is unfortunately located across the street from a club which plays loud music late into the night. Fortunately, the windows and curtains are quite thick and keep out most of the sound. My husband, who usually has trouble sleeping if there is a lot of noise, slept soundly, although that could be because we walked Paris three times over. :) Two metro stops are close by: St. Philippe du Roule accesses a small but useful line (9); the FDR station (1,9) on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es gave us easy access to almost everything else, although getting to the Latin Quarter was a bit of a challenge from here. One might think that a hotel at this price point should be all plus and no minus, but I don't think that actually exists. Most of the hotels we looked at for this price may have been more elegant or service oriented, but they looked like a tiny version of \"Auntie's Parlor\". We were willing to trade a bit of the \"old world luxury\" to avoid the \"old world charm\". I want to point out, I've purposely dwelled on the bad points in this review for full disclosure. The were many many good points: we're grateful for the refrigerator that kept our picnic dinner of cheeses, olives, pate, rose champagne, and the best macarons in Paris cold until we ate it while watching the Eiffel tower, to the front desk receptionist that went out of her way to guarantee our reservations at the Jules Verne, the 2 minute walk to a huge and hot shower and soft bed after spending a fantastic day with thousands of people on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9e watching the final stage of the Tour de France, the quite corner where my husband and I sat in the lobby looking through an art book, the lovely bowl of delicious cherries in the room when we arrived. We have many wonderful, irreplaceable memories of the Beauchamps! And like all love at first sight, the flaws are to be expected - the lasting fervor comes from rising a bit above all that.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dusseldorf, Germany", "Title": "\u201cSaved me from a disastrous experience at another hotel\u201d", "Author": "PecositaPri", "ReviewID": "UR74865133", "Content": "So after leaving the Elysees Mermoz hotel after 15 minutes (see my review on that hotel for additional details), I was close to breaking down and was wandering around the streets of Paris in search of another hotel for the night. Five minutes later I walked past the Hotel Beauchamps. I texted my boyfriend to ask him to look up the rates online. He told me what they were and then I went in and asked the receptionist if they had any availability for the night and the price. The receptionist was amazingly friendly and quoted a walk-in price that was EUR60 less than the online booking price, putting the room at the same price as what I would have paid at the Elysees Mermoz, had I stayed there. The other thing about the receptionist was that, once I explained that I had to leave at 5:30 the next morning, she offered me the single room which is usually used by business travelers. I really liked the way that she tailored the offer to match my needs. The decor of the hotel was definitely a bit funkier than the Elysees Mermoz and the bathrooms much smaller, but it was a great experience.

They even told me that the air conditioning in that part of the hotel was a known problem - so goodness knows why they thought a continental breakfast would be sufficient compensation!

They weren't - I had to go and get them myself and carry them to the other side of the hotel. I also didn't get the newspapers I had requested during my stay.
