The double room is still under 20 sqm with queen size bed but once you open the window and you see the Pantheon you'll forget about how uncomfortable and old the room is. There's no elevator and you'll have breakfast in the hotel's bar which it's actually perfect for the view. The good part is that you are in front of the Pantheon so you can't get better than this if you want to wander around. If you think about renting a car, consider that the entire area is closed and during the weekends the restrictions are even wider so you would end up parking the car at minimum 1Km away from the hotel.

Only downside...... tons of peddlers, trying to sell you roses and gadget things that light up, oh and also beware, at the Colosseum and outside the Pantheon you will see people dressed as Gladiators, they do try and get you to have your photo taken with them (using your camera) then you pay for that priviledge.

It is a buffet style meal, but things were kept topped up and although nothing was outstanding, its certainly a bonus to have breakfast watching the city start to come alive again in the morning, as you can eat in the Piazza. WiFi was not provided, a little disappointed at a hotel of this price.

Although a bit more expensive than other hotels I looked at (all further out from the centre), it scored because of its prime location and the reviews, well deserved, of its friendliness and service. Do not assume all hotels offer courtesy and good service in Rome! Emails were answered promptly and accurately, and the reception staff were all excellent in their attitude and helpfulness. This was a short trip for my wife and I on our first trip to Rome, although I had been there briefly on business some 2 decades before. So we needed somewhere central, within easy walking distance of the major sights. Abruzzi cannot be more central. Arriving early evening - by the way, if you do not know Rome, take the hotel's offer of a private car to/from the airport, well worth the money to avoid the hassle - we wandered out to find a place to eat. Ignoring the hustlers in the cafes around the Piazza del Rotunda, we found ourselves less than 5 minutes window-shopping time later in Pzza Navona. Christmas market in full swing and a pleasant restaurant with an adequate menu. On subsequent days, 10 minutes stroll could have got us to Trevi and the confection of the Vitt Emanuele II \"wedding cake\" - shopping made both excursions considerably longer! As other reviewers write, with the hotel's good sound-proofing the noise in the piazza doesn't percolate sufficiently to stop a good night's sleep. The room was surprisingly big and airy, with plenty of manoeuvring room and space for suitcases. We have stayed at other places of an equivalent star rating with rooms that were distinctly cramped. Breakfast is in a cafe across the square and plentiful, though the scrambled eggs deposited fresh into the hot tray were cold; also ask for expresso or capuccino, as the coffee from the flask is awful. This is not under the hotel's control though. We had two and a half days of shopping and sightseeing and regretfully left, albeit a bit footsore, promising ourselves to return - naturally to the Abruzzi. One criticism of the otherwise very acceptable compact bathroom is that anyone of, shall we say, a stout build will find closing and opening the shower door a challenge, as the gap between the door and the shower reduces to about 30cm. Fortunately we are both slim, but even so it was a bit of a squeeze.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSuperb loaction, friendly staff, very clean, quite small\u201d", "Author": "RichardGr", "ReviewID": "UR121617610", "Content": "We stayed here for a long weekend in Rome and on the whole it was fantastic.

On the negative sides, our room was the only room in the hotel next to the toilet which was for staff use (room 106 I think), so at very early o'clock we were awoken by the sound of a toilet being flushed. The room was very small (not a problem) but the shower cubicle was tiny. Once in, the shower was very good (powerful and hot) but if you are fuller figured, it may be a squeeze to get through the cubicle doors. And (no fault of the hotel) the noise/music in the square carries on well into the evening, so on day 2, I bought some ear plugs from the local pharmacy - problem solved. If the rooms were not well double glazed it would be much louder. We would be more than happy to stay there again as the price (we feel) was good.

She recommended it as being in a great location, clean and comfortable, nothing fancy but friendly and good value for money. She was absolutely right and, even though you still have to carry your cases up to the first floor to catch the lift (not a problem for us with hand luggage), it had even improved since her last stay with a rerfurbished reception/entrance lobby. We spent a long weekend and couldn't fault the hotel. Yes, the rooms are snug but a) we weren't planning to spend much time in them and b) knew in advance what to expect. My sister joined us on the second day and had her own (double) room while my friend and I shared a suite with my mother; she had the single room and we shared a double bed (no twin option.) I'm not a great sleeper nowadays, but I was amazed at how well I slept - all the walking helped but the bed was comfortable too (even with my friend in it for the first time since school days.) When we were shown into the room (2nd floor, corner over the reception at the front, overlooking the Pantheon), my heart sank at the prospect of trying to sleep with all the crowds down below living La Dolce Vita half the night but, to my very pleasant surprise, everything was silent by midnight and the buzz didn't start until 8ish in the morning. I would very happily stay there again and even look forward to it - there's a good view of the Pantheon from the room! The bathroom was clean and adequate for three ladies sharing. There's also good aircon, which quickly but gently cooled down the rooms whenever we returned; we switched it off at night, opened the windows (lovely fresh air, no noise) and were comfortable. A great new addition from my friend's last trip was the breakfast facility at a local cafe in the square. You also get a discount, as a hotel customer, on any meals, snacks or drinks consumed there at other times. Very handy for meeting up and next door to a fabulous deli where we picked up lunch one day to eat in a park. The Pantheon is so central, we walked everywhere, in every direction, and easily found our way back to Abruzzi. We couldn't have been better located.

It is in a fantastic location, right on the piazza in front of the Pantheon (literally steps from it). We could watch the nightlife and impromtu entertainment so common in Rome right from our room. Our room was clean and comfortable and relatively large by Rome standards. The morning buffet style breakfast was in a restaurant across the piazza and was both good and more than a simple continental type affair. The staff was outstanding and helped us out with directions and restaurant questions (we thought Anthony's down the street had very good food - but there are tons of choices all over, although some much better than other both in taste and value). Being so close to the Pantheon put us in easy walking distance to the Trevi Fountain and Plaza Navorna (5 minutes) as well as the nightly stroll through the historic center with everyone else, really magical and all you dream Rome to be about. We walked to the Colessum/Forum, Spanish Steps, Jewish Ghetto, and Trastevere quite easily as well (between 15-25 minutes each). The bus stop to the Vatican was about 3 or 4 blocks away (5 minutes) and easy to catch (we actually walked back from the Vatican to explore that area more on the way back - 30 to 45 minutes just playing around). The metro is a little bit of a walk (20-30 minutes maybe) so it was not something we used as a result. All things considered this was a great value for the money and exactly what we sought as a central base from which to explore Rome. We definitely would stay there again and recommend it for those wanting to stay in this area of Rome. P.S. If you are going to be in Rome for a few days, make sure you buy a Roma Pass, not only for using public transportation, but also to be able to skip the lines at two of the historical sites (your choice from their list of particpants) whose admission is included for free (particularly the Colessum, where the line to just buy tickets was at least 2 hours long - we literally walked right in with no line for tickets or entry). They have a whole list of places you can use your two free admissions to, but make sure you use it for the Colessum! Also, make sure you reserve a time for your Vatican visit, including buying your tickets online and printing your voucher (the Vatican is not covered by the Roma Pass though). This will also save you at least 2 hours in line waiting to buy tickets, again, we walked right in at our appointed time. Finally if the Borghese is on your list (it should be), you must have reservations (which you can get online) to get in (I think this is also one of the Roma Pass choices).", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cFirst time in Italy\u201d", "Author": "adam s s", "ReviewID": "UR118058943", "Content": "We just returned from our first trip to Italy and while in Rome we stayed at The Hotel Abruzzi.

We really loved the breakfast every morning at the little restaurant across the square - they served eggs, meats, fruit, sweets, bottled water - it was an absolute value.

However, there are about ten other hotels also within about 100 meters of Pantheon. We had a double room with Pantheon view. I'd say from the view we must have had one of the better rooms in the hotel. The rooms are small about what you'd expect for 3 star. The bed is where the problems started for us. Another previous review mentioned an itchy reaction to the bedding, they thought it may be bed bugs. My wife also had a skin rash reaction after the first night of sleeping here. We don't think it was bed bugs, rather they likely use cheap commercial detergents or maybe just poor quality sheets. They certainly weren't soft or comfortable. She broke out all over her face, neck, and shoulders. Basically everywhere skin was touching the sheets, so it was clearly from that. In addition to the sheets that cause allergic reactions, the bed was very hard and not comfortable to sleep on at all. Their pillows are like the complimentary airline pillows. How much could new pillows cost? Seriously. The second night the power went out, so this made our misery go up even more as it was very hot. The hotel employee (and there was usually only one working at a time) was very unhelpful and claimed the block was out, even though the restaurant downstairs and the hotel next door had power. The power was out for nearly 3 hours, so we lost a night of rest that really threw us off schedule. Not even an apology was offered to us when we checked out. They acted like nothing happened. You'd think they would have at least offered an apology, even if it wasn't their fault. Literally did not care, said very little to us at all during checkout. Additionally, they have the antiquated \"leave your key at the front desk when you leave\" system, which is a little annoying to have to ask for your key every time you come and go. Also, when we checked out, no help was offered for our bags, as only one person was working. And the lift does not go all the way to the ground floor, you have to carry your bags up one flight of stairs yourself. I haven't even gotten to the shower, which if you are over 5'5\" have fun getting your hair wet. Bathroom was tiny as expected, but couldn't they at least raise the shower head 6-8\"?

HOTEL ITSELF: Very, very clean and all the comforts we needed. Rooms were not huge, but we were in Rome and the idea was to stay out of our room anyway.

While there is no breakfast room guests are given vouchers for the cafe across the piazza for coffee(s) and cornetto(s)--very nice! The location is perfect in the centro storico. You can walk to most sites or take the little electric bus, #16 to things farther away. Numerous gelato bars near.

We have visited Rome a number of times and stayed in a couple of different hotels but we especially like the area around Piazza della Rotunda so decided on the Abruzzi. The location is excellent but it only has a minute lobby on the ground floor. Our room was on the first floor and we had a view into the piazza and with the Pantheon to the left and the fountain in front. Our room was quite small but adequate; our bathroom was very nice, a super shower with abundant hot water and clean towels every day. The chamber maids did an excellent job. I was not aware when we booked that breakfast was served in a cafe opposite but this worked well and was a very pleasant start to the day - until our last morning when it was very wet and cold. The hotel itself has no facilities apart from a small lounge on the first floor; this did not bother us as we were out most of the time. There was a power cut for almost a whole day but this affected nearby buildings too so was not the fault of the hotel. We enjoyed our stay but thought it was quite expensive for the limited facilites, though of course we realised we were paying for the location.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil", "Title": "\u201cTerrific Location, Good Room, Poor Service\u201d", "Author": "drimazza", "ReviewID": "UR84959149", "Content": "Just in front of Pantheon.Who is looking for good location , good room and fair price , this is definitely a good option.

The only negatives were that we barely had any warm water and at times it was completely cold. We mentioned it to everyone working the front and were just told it was because too many people were showering at once! I'd expect better from a hotel in this price range. Secondly, you need to pay for wireless access. I didn't mind paying, but then the signal did not reach our room, I could only use it in the common room. Not a huge problem, but annoying.

The bathroom was spacious though but little counter space. One of the main reasons to stay here is 1.) it is close to about everything. 20 minute walk to Coliseum, 10 minutes to Trevi Fountain, 30 minutes to Vatican and 2.) when you open your window you are staring directly at the Pantheon. Unfortunately for us, half of the Pantheon was under restoration but lucky for us, when we opened our window we weren't able to see the scaffolding. The power went out for about an hour while there but staff was courteous and made sure we were comfortable.

The hotel couldn't be in a better location directly across from the Pantheon!! And since its on a corner I think a lot of its rooms have great views- our room looked out on the piazza and the Pantheon and each night various street musicians would strike up song outside our windows- and we could enjoy the excitement of the piazza from the comfort of our room. The staff was VERY pleasant and very efficient. They always greeted you with a pleasant hello and were onsite nearly 24 hours a day to meet our needs. Breakfast is served free at an outside cafe across the square from the Pantheon- Internet was only 10 euros for 24 hours of use which lasted me the entire week (you could buy less but for 10 euros I liked feeling it was limitless). The only downside is the hotel is not near the Metro- however, after a couple of days we figured a very efficient way to walk to the Spango Spanish Steps metro line and it became easy to jump on the subway. An easier way when you're first there is get on at the Colosseum and you realize its pretty easy to find your way to the hotel from that area as well. But the charm of Pantheon area was worth the walk to the metro. Don't let the outside of the hotel freak you out- its just in a very very very old square- inside its very nice and modern. I thought the old world Italian charm of the outside was pretty cool", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Abruzzi", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d236134-Reviews-Hotel_Abruzzi-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$127 - $408*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">P.zza della Rotonda, 69</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00186</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "236134", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/35/6b/a0/pantheon-view-from-our.jpg"}}
